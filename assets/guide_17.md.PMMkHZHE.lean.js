The band didn't last longer than couple of years and Rowan went on to join Seatrain, where he met Richard Greene. After two albums with Seatrain, Greene and Rowan went on to form Muleskinner with banjoist Bill Keith, whom Greene had played with in Jim Kweskin and the Jug Band in the early 1960s, and Clarence White, former guitarist of Kentucky Colonels and The Byrds, along with bassist John Kahn and drummer John Guerin, who also worked for The Byrds. Planned show with Bill Monroe This lineup can be considered as a bluegrass supergroup, a term not often used with bluegrass. The original start of the group was connected with Bill Monroe, as Richard Greene (who played for his Bluegrass Boys before), was asked to put a band together to join him in a television program. However, Monroe's bus had some technical problems and Muleskinner had to play the whole evening on their own and it was a success. Recording contract All this resulted in a recording contract with Warner Bros. and the band recorded its first studio album, Muleskinner, which included elements from jazz, country and progressive bluegrass. This recording can be noted as the first one in the bluegrass genre to include drums. Clarence White death The album was successful, but the band ended under tragic circumstances: guitarist Clarence White was killed by a drunken driver just couple of months after the record was released.Clarence White death The band also recorded a live album in 1973, which was released 25 years later.

Broten (born 1967) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2013, who represented the Toronto riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore. She served in the cabinets of Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty. Background Prior to entering politics, she was a lawyer, community activist and volunteer. Broten attended McMaster University from 1986 to 1990, and has both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science degree from the institution. She also received an LL.B. from the University of Western Ontario in 1993. She was a law clerk to Madam Justice Claire L'Heureux-Dubé at the Supreme Court of Canada from 1993 to 1994, and later had a practice in civil and commercial litigation. She has also served as Chair of the Board of Directors for the Gatehouse, a community centre for survivors of child abuse. In 2007, Broten and her husband were criticized after they applied for a permit to build a large two-storey garage behind their home. Dubbed the \\"garage mahal\\" by neighbours, the structure was meant to hold the couple's four vehicles. The plan was notable at the time due to Broten's position as the Minister of the Environment. Following a public outcry and stories in the media, plans to build the garage were cancelled.Rob Ferguson. Broten won't build 'garage mahal' after all. Toronto Star. July 4, 2007.http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/06/do_as_i_say_not.php# Broten, her husband, and their two children moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 2013. Provincial politics Broten ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative Morley Kells in Etobicoke-Lakeshore by 5,156 votes. She ran again in the 2003 election, and defeated Kells by 6,722 votes amid a provincial shift to the Liberals. =38th Legislative Assembly= On October 23, 2003, she was named as the Parliamentary Assistant to Premier Dalton McGuinty. In this role she conducted province-wide consultations to develop meaningful reforms to address domestic violence in Ontario. This led to the Government’s Domestic Violence Action Plan which included a groundbreaking public education campaign. She also chaired the Premier’s Shared Air Summit, which drew scientists and policy makers from across North America to tackle the linked issues of smog and transboundary air pollution. She introduced two private member bills in 2004. The first, entitled Kids First Licences Act, proposed to allow drivers to make charitable donations to children's charities whenever they renewed their vehicle licence. The second, called Workplace Violence and Workplace Harassment (an amendment to the Occupational Health and Safety Act), proposed to impose additional duties and responsibilities in workplaces. On June 29, 2005, Broten was appointed to cabinet as Minister of the Environment. As minister, she developed policies under one of Canada’s most comprehensive Climate Change Plans in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. She also introduced the Clean Water Act designed to better safeguard Ontario’s drinking water. =39th Legislative Assembly= Broten was re-elected in 2007, and was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. While there, she authored a report detailing a Five Point Action Plan to create more opportunities and reduce barriers for internationally trained doctors in Ontario. Her report formed the basis for new legislation in 2008. In 2008, she introduced legislation that imposes a duty to report images of child abuse. The following year she unanimously passed a resolution calling for a review of reporting standards for listed companies. In 2009, Broten was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. On October 7 that year, she was appointed Minister of Children and Youth Services and Minister Responsible for Women's Issues.Premier Announces Changes To Ontario Cabinet =40th Legislative Assembly= In 2011, Broten was re-elected again. Premier Dalton McGuinty reorganized his cabinet and appointed her as Minister of Education and minister responsible for women's issues. On February 11, 2013, following a long battle with teachers' unions, Premier Kathleen Wynne appointed her as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Laurel resigned from the cabinet and the legislature on July 2, 2013. On June 23, 2013, Broten announced that she would be \\"leaving politics effective July 2nd\\" and moving to Halifax, Nova Scotia. =Cabinet positions= =Electoral record= Post-political career After she resigned from the Ontario Cabinet and legislature, Broten and her family eventually settled in Hammonds Plains, Nova Scotia. She had initially stated that she was moving to Halifax, for her husband Paul obtained a job at Emera as special counsel for senior projects. Not long after Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil's Liberal Party swept to electoral victory, she was hired as a government consultant to lead a comprehensive review of the taxation in the province. Her final report, released on November 19, 2014,https://novascotia.ca/finance/en/home/taxation/default.aspx made 22 recommendations on taxation; these included eliminating the tax bracket for high-income ($150,000 and over) earners, eliminating refundable tax credits, eliminating a tax rebate for seniors, reducing corporate taxes for large businesses, introducing a carbon tax and expanding the HST to include numerous exempt products including books, children's clothes, diapers, and feminine hygiene products. Broten's report was generally panned, and Nova Scotia Finance Minister Diana Whalen subsequently scheduled several public consultations across the province in the winter of 2015. On March 25, 2015, Whalen said \\"every recommendation in the Broten review is [being] looked at\\", including a carbon tax, but only explicitly ruled out increasing the HST on books and eliminating a volunteer firefighter tax credit. On January 14, 2015, Broten was selected by the Nova Scotia Business Incorporated (NSBI) board to the position of President and CEO of NSBI.https://novascotia.ca/News/Release/?id=20150114002 Her initial salary was comparable to that of her predecessor, Stephen Lund.

Fairbanks came from a prominent family in Dedham, Massachusetts. He was the son of Ebenezer and Prudence Farrington Fairbanks and lived in the Fairbanks House, today the oldest wood-framed structure still standing in North America. He was left with a lame arm after a having smallpox as a child which was treated with mercury. His sixth cousin, once removed, was Vice President Charles Fairbanks. Jason's trial and attempted escape were national news in 1801. History Fairbanks had been courting Elizabeth Fales, the daughter of Nehemiah Fales. Her family claimed she was resistant to marrying him, but friends said they seemed very much in love. On May 18, 1801, Fairbanks met with Fales in a birch grove next to \\"Mason's pasture\\" in Dedham, though the exact location today is not known. What happened there cannot be proven, but Fairbanks appeared about 2 hours later at the Fales house, covered with blood and holding a knife. He told them that their daughter had committed suicide and he had tried to do the same but could not. She had been stabbed 11 times, including once in the back. Elizabeth's funeral was held on May 20th. Fairbanks' wounds were serious; he was in no shape to be taken directly to jail. He was therefore taken into the Fales household, where he received medical treatment. On August 8, 1801, the trial, which would last 3 days, began. The prosecution claimed Jason tried to force Elizabeth (Betsy) to marry him, and when she did not agree he stabbed her. His wounds were received as she tried to fight him off and he stabbed her in the back as she tried to run away. The defense claimed Elizabeth was so distraught that her family did not approve of Jason that she tried to commit suicide. Jason was very sickly and weak, and had no use of his right arm, and the defense claimed he would not have been able to overpower Elizabeth. They proved that the stab wound in Elizabeth's back could, at a certain angle, have been self-inflicted. Jason claimed he froze in shock when she began stabbing herself and then felt so guilty for not stopping her that he tried to kill himself to join her, but was unable to. After only 2 hours of deliberation the jury indicted Fairbanks for the murder of Fales and he was jailed in Dedham. James Sullivan, the Attorney General of Massachusetts, handled the prosecution. Harrison Gray Otis and John Lowell, Jr., two prominent Federalist lawyers, defended Fairbanks. He was found guilty of the murder and was sentenced to death by hanging. Escape Before the execution could take place, Fairbanks escaped with the help of his brother, a cousin, a friend, and his nephew, Nathaniel Davis. A $1,000 bounty was placed on his head, and a newspaper headline screamed \\"Stop the Murderer!\\" The party tried to make their way to Canada, but stopped to eat in Skenesboro, now known as Whitehall, New York, just south of the Canada–US border. Fairbanks was recaptured. Fairbanks was returned to the Boston jail, for authorities no longer trusted the Dedham jail, and on September 10, 1801, Fairbanks was hanged at a massive event. He was twenty years old. Two Army cavalry companies and a volunteer militia unit made sure he did not escape again, and the 10,000 people who showed up at the Town Common to witness the execution were five times the town's population at the time. Within two days of his execution, the Report of the Trial of Jason Fairbanks was published. The story was then written up in a pamphlet entitled A Deed of Horror! Trial of Jason Fairbanks for the Murder of His Sweetheart in 1801. It became the basis for a novel called The Life of Jason Fairbanks: A Novel Founded on Fact, which is believed to no longer exist. Ebenezer Fairbanks Jr. (Jason's brother) spent a great deal of time and money long after Jason's death trying to prove his innocence and change public opinion, though was never successful. He was buried in the Old Village Cemetery in Dedham. References General references * Freeman, Dale H. Melancholy Catastrophe!

It was incorporated in 1854 by the combination of several existing railway companies. Later, it was amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway at the Grouping in 1923. Its main line survives to the present day as part of the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh.  Introduction  Unlike many other pre-Grouping companies the NER had a relatively compact territory, in which it had a near monopoly. That district extended through Yorkshire, County Durham and Northumberland, with outposts in Westmorland and Cumberland. The only company penetrating its territory was the Hull & Barnsley, which it absorbed shortly before the main grouping. The NER's main line formed the middle link on the Anglo-Scottish \\"East Coast Main Line\\" between London and Edinburgh, joining the Great Northern Railway near Doncaster and the North British Railway at Berwick-upon-Tweed. Although primarily a Northern English railway, the NER had a short length of line in Scotland, in Roxburghshire, with stations at Carham and Sprouston on the Tweedmouth-Kelso route (making it the only English railway with sole ownership of any line in Scotland), and was a joint owner of the Forth railway bridge and its approach lines. The NER was the only English railway to run trains regularly into Scotland, over the Berwick-Edinburgh main line as well as on the Tweedmouth-Kelso branch. hotel The total length of line owned was and the company's share capital was £82 million. The headquarters were at York and the works at Darlington, Gateshead, York and elsewhere.Harmsworth (1921) Befitting the successor to the Stockton & Darlington Railway, the NER had a reputation for innovation. It was a pioneer in architectural and design matters and in electrification. In its final days it also began the collection that became the Railway Museum at York, now the National Railway Museum. In 1913 the company achieved a total revenue of £11,315,130 () with working expenses of £7,220,784 (). During the First World War, The NER lost a total of 1,908 men. They also raised two 'Pals Battalions', the 17th (N.E.R. Pioneer) Battalion and 32nd (N.E.R. Reserve) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers. This was the first time that a battalion had been raised from one Company. The company also sent two tug boats, NER No.3. and Stranton The latter became HM Tug Char and was lost at sea on 16 January 1915 with the lost of all hands.  Constituent parts of the NER  Brompton station on the Leeds Northern line in 1961 Constituent companies of the NER are listed in chronological order under the year of amalgamation. Their constituent companies are indented under the parent company with the year of amalgamation in parenthesis.

The four largest, at Newcastle, Darlington, York and Hull survive in transport use. Alnwick is still extant but in non-transport use since 1991 as a second-hand book warehouse, the others having been demolished during the 1950s/60s state-owned railway era, two (Sunderland and Middlesbrough) following Second World War bomb damage. *York station (York) was the hub of the system, and the headquarters of the line was located here. The basis for the present station was opened on 25 June 1877. Until the advent of modern signalling, the 295-lever box was the largest manually worked signal box in Britain. *Newcastle station (Newcastle), opened on 29 August 1850, became the largest on the NER. Other principal stations were located at Sunderland, Darlington and Hull. The station at Leeds was a joint undertaking with the London and North Western Railway. Architects The NER was the first railway company in the world to appoint a full-time salaried architect to work with its chief engineer in constructing railway facilities. Some of the men appointed were based in, or active in, Darlington. * George Townsend Andrews was the first architect associated with the North Eastern Railway. He designed the first permanent station at York, along with others on the NER route. He also designed the Assembly Rooms in York. * Thomas Prosser held the position from 1854 to 1874. He worked in Newcastle. * Benjamin Burleigh, served for two years, dying in office. * William Peachey, was based in Darlington, and served for two years. Peachey had been architect to the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and when this merged into the NER in 1863, he was made Darlington section architect. Most of his work was to extend and improve railway buildings. Elsewhere he built the Zetland Hotel at Saltburn (1861–63), and the Royal Station Hotel at York (1877–82). He also practised privately, designing a few nonconformist chapels, including Grange Road Baptist Chapel in Darlington, 1870–1. * William Bell worked for the NER for 50 years; he was chief architect for 37 years, between 1877 and 1914. His major contributions were as NER architect. Bank Top (1884–87) is one of the best examples of his station designs, for which he developed a standard system of roof building. He added various elements to the North Road Engineering works between 1884 and 1910. With Horace Field, he designed the splendid Headquarters Offices in York in 1904. He also designed the offices of the Mechanical Engineer's Department in Brinkburn Road in 1912, showing that he could adapt his style to the new influences of the Queen Anne revival. *Arthur Pollard and Stephen Wilkinson each briefly filled the position of chief architect. The merger of the company into the LNER resulted in abolition of the department. Professional design was carried through to small fixtures and fittings, such as platform seating, for which the NER adopted distinctive 'coiled snake' bench-ends. Cast-iron footbridges were also produced to a distinctive design. The NER's legacy continued to influence the systematic approach to design adopted by the grouped LNER.

Further extensions taking the electrification to South Shields were carried out in March 1938 by the London and North Eastern Railway The lines were originally electrified at 600 V DC using the 3rd rail system, although after 1934 the operating voltage was raised to 630 V DC. On the Newcastle Quayside Branch overhead line of tramway type was used for upper and lower yards with 3rd rail in the interconnecting tunnels between the yards. =Newport-Shildon= EF1 electric freight locomotive The Newport-Shildon line was electrified on the 1,500 V DC overhead system between 1914 and 1916 and the locomotives which later became British Rail Class EF1 were used on this section. Traffic The NER carried a larger tonnage of mineral and coal traffic than any other principal railway. The NER was a partner (with the North British and the Great Northern Railway) in the East Coast Joint Stock operation from 1860.

Coaching stock The NER originally operated with short four and six wheeled coaches with a fixed wheelbase. From these were developed the standard six-wheeled, low elliptical roofed coaches which were built in their thousands around the 1880s. One variety alone, the diagram 15, five compartment, full 3rd class, numbered around a thousand. The NER started building bogie stock for general service use in 1894, clerestories for general use with a variation built for use on the tightly curved line from Malton to Whitby. There were also a series of low ark roofed bogie coaches (with birdcage brakes) for use on the coast line north of Scarborough. Coach manufacture moved to high arched roof vehicles but with substantially the same body design in the early 1900s. The NER had limited need for vestibuled coaches but from 1900 built a series of vestibuled, corridor coaches with British Standard gangways, for their longer distance services. The company introduced clerestory corridor dining trains on services between London and Edinburgh. The initial trial was run between York and Newcastle in 1 hour 30 minutes on 30 July 1900. The new train consisted of eight coaches and was long (excluding the engine), and had seating for 50 first-class and 211 third-class passengers. At the same time they built (in conjunction with their partners) similar coaches for the East Coast Joint Stock (GNR/NER/NBR) and the Great Northern and North Eastern Joint Stock. All NER coach building was concentrated at their York Carriage Works, which went on to be the main LNER carriage works after grouping. With the introduction of the standard 6-wheeled coaches NER carriage livery was standardised as 'deep crimson' (a deeper colour with more blue in it than that used by the Midland Railway), lined with cream edged on both sides with a thin vermillion line. For a time the cream was replaced with gold leaf. Lettering ('N.E.R.' or when there was sufficient space 'North Eastern Railway' in full, together with 'First', 'Third' and 'Luggage Compt.' on the appropriate door) and numbering; was in strongly serifed characters, blocked and shaded to give a 3D effect. The NER's bogie coach building programme was such that, almost unique amongst pre-grouping railways, they had sufficient bogie coaches to cover normal service trains; six wheel coaches were reserved for strengthening and excursion trains.

Founded in 1680, it is the oldest active theatre company in the world. Established as a French state-controlled entity in 1995, it is the only state theatre in France to have its own permanent troupe of actors. The company's primary venue is the Salle Richelieu, which is a part of the Palais-Royal complex and located at 2 rue de Richelieu on the Place André-Malraux in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. The theatre has also been known as the Théâtre de la République and popularly as \\"La Maison de Molière\\" (The House of Molière). It acquired the latter name from the troupe of the best-known playwright associated with the Comédie-Française, Molière. He was considered the patron of French actors. He died seven years before his troupe became known as the Comédie-Française, but the company continued to be known as \\"La Maison de Molière\\" even after the official change of name. History Iconic corner, entry to the Salle Richelieu, 2009. The Comédie- Française was founded on 8 August 1680 by a decree of Louis XIV merging the only two Parisian acting troupes of the time, the troupe of the Guénégaud Theatre and that of the Hôtel de Bourgogne. On the death of Molière in 1673, the troupe at the Guénégaud had been formed by a merger of the Théâtre du Marais and the Troupe de Molière.Hartnoll 1983, p. 168; Clarke 1998, pp. 13–14. Two years later they received a royal grant of 12,000 livres per year; and seven years later they received their present designation. Thus the Comédie-Française may be said to have an unbroken tradition reaching back to the days of Molière. The company gave its first performance on 25 August 1680 at the Guénégaud.Brocket & Hildy 2008, p. 195. Its leading actors included Molière's widow, Armande Béjart, her husband, Guérin d'Estriché, La Grange, Mlle Champmeslé, Baron, Hauteroche, and Raymond Poisson.Hartnoll 1983, p. 169; Gaines 2002, p. 210 (Guérin), pp. 249–250 (La Grange). The repertoire consisted of the collection of theatrical works by Molière and Jean Racine, along with a few works by Pierre Corneille, Paul Scarron and Jean Rotrou. In the 18th century, the Comédie-Française was often enjoyed by the French nobility, since the price to watch at the theater was expensive. On the performance of Joseph Chénier's anti-monarchical play Charles IX in 1789, violent political discussions arose among the performers, and ultimately they split into two sections: the Republican party, under the young tragedian Talma, establishing a new theatre under the name \\"Théâtre de la République,\\" on the site of the present building in the Rue de Richelieu; while the Royalist section took the title \\"Théâtre de la Nation.\\" On 3 September 1793, during the French Revolution, the Théâtre de la Nation was closed by order of the Committee of Public Safety for putting on the allegedly seditious play Pamela, and the actors were imprisoned though gradually released later. On 31 May 1799, the new government made the Salle Richelieu available and allowed the actors to reconstitute the troupe. The Comédie-Française today has a repertoire of 3,000 works and three theatres in Paris (Salle Richelieu, next to the Palais Royal; théâtre du Vieux-Colombier; Studio-Théâtre). Theatre buildings The Comédie-Française has had several homes since its inception in 1680 in the Salle Guénégaud. In 1689, it was established in a theatre across from the Café Procope. From 1770 to 1782, the Comédie performed in the theatre in the royal palace of the Tuileries. In 1782, the company moved into the Salle du Faubourg Saint-Germain, designed by architects Marie-Joseph Peyre and Charles De Wailly and located on the site of today's Odéon. Since 1799, the Comédie-Française has been housed in the Salle Richelieu (architect Victor Louis) at 2, rue de Richelieu. This theatre was enlarged and modified in the 1800s, then rebuilt in 1900 after a severe fire.Wild 2012, pp. 99–100, 383–384. The actress Jane Henriot was the only casualty of the fire. Theatrical troupe The membership of the theatrical troupe is divided into \\"sociétaires\\" and \\"pensionnaires.\\" The former are regular members of the organisation and as such receive a pension after 20 years of service, while the latter are paid actors who may, after a certain length of service, become \\"sociétaires.\\" The names of nearly all the great actors and dramatists of France have, at some time in their career, been associated with that of the Comédie-Française. Administrators of the Comédie-Française The chief administrator of the Comédie-Française has been given the title administrateur général since Simonis' term of 1850. Before that, a variety of titles were given.

A single substitution gives silabenzene proper; additional substitutions give a disilabenzene (3 theoretical isomers), trisilabenzene (3 isomers), etc. Silabenzenes have been the targets of many theoretical and synthetic studies by organic chemists interested in the question of whether analogs of benzene with Group IV elements heavier than carbon, e.g., silabenzene, stannabenzene and germabenzene—so-called \\"heavy benzenes\\"—exhibit aromaticity. Although several heteroaromatic compounds bearing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms have been known since the early stages of organic chemistry, silabenzene had been considered to be a transient, un-isolable compound and was detected only in low-temperature matrices or as its Diels- Alder adduct for a long time. In recent years, however, a kinetically stabilized silabenzene and other heavy aromatic compounds with silicon or germanium atoms have been reported. Synthesis Stable 2-silanaphthalene and silabenzene Several attempts to synthesize stable silabenzenes have been reported from the late 1970s using well-known bulky substituents such as a tert-butyl (1,1-dimethylethyl) or a TMS (trimethylsilyl) group, but such silabenzenes readily react with themselves to give the corresponding dimer even at low temperature (below -100°C) due to the high reactivity of silicon- carbon π bonds. In 1978 Barton and Burns reported that flow pyrolysis of 1-methyl-1-allyl-1-silacyclohexa-2,4-diene through a quartz tube heated to 428 °C using either ethyne or perfluoro-2-butyne as both a reactant and a carrier gas afforded the methyl-1-silylbenzene Diel-Alder adducts, 1-methyl-1-silabicyclo[2.2.2]octatriene or 1-methyl-2,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1-silabicyclo[2.2.2]octatriene, respectively, by way of a retro-ene reaction. A computational investigation in 2013 points out a new route to stable silabenzenes at ambient conditions through Brook rearrangement. The [1,3]-Si → O shift of TMS or triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) substituted precursors with tetrahedral silicon atoms to an adjacent carbonyl oxygen lead to aromatic Brook-type silabenzenes. Following the synthesis of the naphthalene analog 2-silanaphthalene, the first sila-aromatic compound, by Norihiro Tokitoh and Renji Okazaki in 1997, the same group reported thermally stable silabenzene in 2000 taking advantage of a new steric protective group. A 9-silaanthracene derivative has been reported in 2002, a 1-silanaphthalene also in 2002. A 1,4-disilabenzene was reported in 2002. In 2007, 1,2-disilabenzene was synthesized via formal [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of a disilyne (Si-Si triple bonded species) and phenylacetylene. Some theoretical studies suggest that the symmetric 1,3,5-trisilabenzene may be more stable than 1,2-disilabenzene. Properties and reactions Isolated silabenzene reacts with various reagents at 1,2- or 1,4-positions to give diene-type products, so the aromaticity of the silabenzene is destroyed. It is different from benzene, which reacts with electrophiles to give not dienes but substituted benzenes, so benzene sustains its aromaticity. Silicon is a semi-metal element, so the Si-C π bond in the silabenzene is highly polarized and easily broken. The silabenzene is also light-sensitive; UV irradiation gives the valence isomer, a silabenzvalene. The theoretical calculations and the NMR chemical shifts of silabenzenes, though, show that silabenzene is an aromatic compound in spite of the different reactivity from benzene and other classical aromatic compounds. Hexasilabenzene In calculations the all-silicon hexasilabenzene Si6H6 is predicted to have 6-fold symmetry or a chair conformation. It was shown that the deviation from planarity in hexasilabenzene is caused by the pseudo Jahn–Teller effect. A stable hexasilaprismane has been known since 1993 A compound isomeric with hexasilabenzene was first reported in 2010. This compound is reported as stable and with according to X-ray crystallography a chairlike tricyclic silicon frame. Hexasilabenzene isomer Abersfelder et al. 2010 The searching of a planar Si6 analogue to benzene has been extended to anionic cycles and structures bearing lithium atoms replacing hydrogens. Through Density functional theory calculations, it has been shown that from a series of planar and tridimensional structures with molecular formula Si6Li2-8, the global minimum is a Si6Li6 planar ring. This particular ring has D2h symmetry with 4 lithium cations placed between two adjacent silicon atoms –forming three-center two-electron bonds –and two more Li cations located above and below the center of the ring’s plane. A highly symmetric D6h structure analogue to hexalithiumbenzene was found to be higher in energy by 2.04 eV to respect to the minimum. Aromaticity was also tested using density functional calculations. DFT can be effectively used to calculate the aromaticity of various molecular systems using the B3LYP hybrid density functional; this method has been proved to be the method of choice for computing delocalized systems. The nucleus- independent chemical shifts (NICS) was selected as the quantitative criterion to evaluate the aromatic character of the structures under study. The global minimum (D2h symmetry ring) and the D6h symmetry ring show values of −3.95 and −5.95, respectively. In NICS calculations, negative values indicate aromaticity. More recently, using a novel genetic algorithm, a Si6Li6 three dimensional structure has been calculated to be more stable than planar isomers.

Symptoms include fever, throat pain, trouble opening the mouth, and a change to the voice. Pain is usually worse on one side. Complications may include blockage of the airway or aspiration pneumonitis. They are typically due to infection by a number of types of bacteria. Often it follows streptococcal pharyngitis. They do not typically occur in those who have had a tonsillectomy. Diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms. Medical imaging may be done to rule out complications. Treatment is by removing the pus, antibiotics, sufficient fluids, and pain medication. Steroids may also be useful. Admission to hospital is generally not needed. In the United States about 3 per 10,000 people per year are affected. Young adults are most commonly affected. Signs and symptoms Unlike tonsillitis, which is more common in the children, PTA has a more even age spread, from children to adults. Symptoms start appearing two to eight days before the formation of an abscess. A progressively severe sore throat on one side and pain during swallowing (odynophagia) usually are the earliest symptoms. As the abscess develops, persistent pain in the peritonsillar area, fever, a general sense of feeling unwell, headache and a distortion of vowels informally known as \\"hot potato voice\\" may appear. Neck pain associated with tender, swollen lymph nodes, referred ear pain and foul breath are also common. While these signs may be present in tonsillitis itself, a PTA should be specifically considered if there is limited ability to open the mouth (trismus). Physical signs of a peritonsillar abscess include redness and swelling in the tonsillar area of the affected side and swelling of the jugulodigastric lymph nodes. The uvula may be displaced towards the unaffected side. =Complications= * Retropharyngeal abscess * Extension of abscess in other deep neck spaces leading to airway compromise; see Ludwig's angina * Sepsis * Glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever (strep throat chronic complications) * Decreased oral intake and dehydration Causes PTA usually arises as a complication of an untreated or partially treated episode of acute tonsillitis. The infection, in these cases, spreads to the peritonsillar area (peritonsillitis). This region comprises loose connective tissue and is hence susceptible to formation of an abscess. PTA can also occur de novo. Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be causative. Commonly involved aerobic pathogens include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Haemophilus. The most common anaerobic species include Fusobacterium necrophorum, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella species, and Bacteroides. Diagnosis Peritonsillar abscess on the person's right as seen on CT imaging Diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms. Medical imaging may be done to rule out complications. Medical imaging may include CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound is also useful in diagnosis. Treatment Medical treatment with antibiotics, volume repletion with fluids, and pain medication is usually adequate, although in cases where airway obstruction or systemic sepsis occurs, surgical drainage may be necessary. Steroids may also be useful. Admission to hospital is generally not needed. =Medication= The infection is frequently penicillin resistant. There are a number of antibiotics options including amoxicillin/clavulanate, clindamycin, or metronidazole in combination with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) or penicillin V. Piperacillin/tazobactam may also be used. =Surgery= The pus can be removed by a number of methods including needle aspiration, incision and drainage, and tonsillectomy. Incision and drainage may be associated with a lower chance of recurrence than needle aspiration but the evidence is very uncertain. Needle aspiration may be less painful but again the evidence is very uncertain. Treatment can also be given while a patient is under anesthesia, but this is usually reserved for children or anxious patients. Tonsillectomy can be indicated if a patient has recurring peritonsillar abscesses or a history of tonsillitis. For patients with their first peritonsillar abscess most ENT-surgeons prefer to \\"wait and observe\\" before recommending tonsillectomy. Epidemiology It is a commonly encountered otorhinolaryngological (ENT) emergency. The number of new cases per year of peritonsillar abscess in the United States has been estimated approximately at 30 cases per 100,000 people. In a study in Northern Ireland, the number of new cases was 10 cases per 100,000 people per year. In Denmark, the number of new cases is higher and reaches 41 cases per 100,000 people per year. Younger children who develop a peritonsillar abscess are often immunocompromised and in them, the infection can cause airway obstruction.

The book is about probability and how it applies to the theory of evolution. It is designed to debunk claims by creationists about the probability of naturalistic mechanisms like natural selection. The main metaphorical treatment is of a geographical landscape upon which evolution can ascend only gradually and cannot climb cliffs (that is known as an adaptive landscape). In the book, Dawkins gives ideas about a seemingly complex mechanism coming about from many gradual steps that were previously unseen. The book grew out of the annual Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, which Dawkins delivered in 1991 (see Growing Up in the Universe).

Formed in 1845, it carried its first passengers the from Kittybrewster, in Aberdeen, to Huntly on 20 September 1854. By 1867 it owned of line and operated over a further . The early expansion was followed by a period of forced economy, but in the 1880s the railway was refurbished, express services began to run and by the end of that decade there was a suburban service in Aberdeen. The railway operated its main line between Aberdeen and and two routes west to , connections could be made at both Keith and Elgin for Highland Railway services to Inverness. There were other junctions with the Highland Railway at and , and at Aberdeen connections for journeys south over the Caledonian and North British Railways. Its eventual area encompassed the three Scottish counties of Aberdeenshire, Banffshire and Moray, with short lengths of line in Inverness-shire and Kincardineshire. Fish from the North Sea ports and whisky from the distilleries of Speyside became important goods traffic. The Royal Family used the Deeside Line for travel to and from Balmoral Castle and when they were in residence a daily special 'Messenger Train' ran from Aberdeen; for most of the railway's life this was its only Sunday service. The company ran three hotels, and a network of feeder bus services was developed in the early 20th century. In 1923, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway as its Northern Scottish area, passing on of line and 122 steam locomotives, most of them 4-4-0 tender locomotives. The railway had several branches, but only its main line remains today as part of the Aberdeen to Inverness Line. History =Half way to Inverness, 1845–1858= Establishment and construction In 1845 the Great North of Scotland Railway was formed to build a railway from Aberdeen to Inverness. The proposed route, which needed few major engineering works, followed the River Don to Inverurie, via Huntly and Keith to a crossing of the River Spey, and then to Elgin and along the coast via Nairn to Inverness. Branch lines to Banff, Portsoy, Garmouth and Burghead would total . At the same time the Perth & Inverness Railway proposed a direct route over the Grampian Mountains to Perth, and the Aberdeen, Banff & Elgin Railway suggested a route that followed the coast to better serve the Banffshire and Morayshire fishing ports. Three private bills were presented to Parliament seeking permission to build a railway, but the Aberdeen, Banff & Elgin failed to raise funds, and the Perth & Inverness Railway was rejected because the railway would be at altitudes that approached and needed steep gradients. The Great North of Scotland Railway Act received Royal Assent on 26 June 1846. In the aftermath of the railway mania railway companies became an unpopular investment and the necessary finance could not be raised. The company suggested at a meeting in November 1849 that whereas £650,000 was needed for a double-track railway from Aberdeen to Inverness, only £375,000 would be needed for a single-track railway from Kittybrewster, from Aberdeen, to Keith, half way to Inverness. The meeting recommended that the bridges and works be built wide enough for a second track when this was needed. Construction eventually began in November 1852, albeit to Huntly, short of Keith, with William Cubitt as engineer. The severe winter the following year delayed work. Between Inverurie and Aberdeen the line took over the Aberdeenshire Canal, the purchase of which delayed construction as it was necessary to settle the claims of each shareholder individually. Opening The reception at Huntly for the official opening train After an inspection by the Board of Trade, the railway opened to goods on 12 September 1854 and approval for the carriage of passengers was given two days later. The railway was officially opened on 19 September, and two locomotives hauling twenty-five carriages carrying 400 passengers left Kittybrewster at 11 am. The number of passengers had grown to about 650 by the time the train arrived to a celebration at Huntly at 1:12 pm. Public services began the following day. There were stations at: * *Buxburn ( after 1897) *Dyce *Kinaldie (open after 1 December) *Kintore *Inverury ( after 1866) *Pitcaple *Oyne *Buchanstone (open after 1 December) *Insch *Wardhouse (open after 1 December) *Kennethmont *Gartly *Huntly The railway was single track with passing loops at the termini and at Kintore, Inverurie and Insch; the loop at Kittybrewster was clear of the platform to allow the locomotive to run round the carriages and push them into the station. A daily goods train took up to 3 hours 40 minutes for the , the goods to Aberdeen also carried passengers and mail and spared cattle a two-day drive to market. Initially there were three passenger services a day taking two hours, fares being old pence (d) a mile for first class and d for third; on one train a day in each direction it was possible to travel for the statutory fare of 1d a mile. Although cheaper than travelling by coach, these fares and the charges for the transport of goods were considered high but not reduced for thirty years. The railway opened short of rolling stock as only half of the twelve locomotives and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed to hold on to the lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident. Waterloo, Keith and Inverness The Great North of Scotland and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway route between Aberdeen and Inverness that opened in August 1858 The Aberdeen Railway (AR) opened from the south to Ferryhill, south of Aberdeen, in April 1850. It had been previously arranged that the Aberdeen and Great North would amalgamate, but this was annulled that year and the Aberdeen was seeking alliances with railways to the south. In 1854 the AR opened its Guild Street terminus in Aberdeen and the Great North sought and obtained powers for a branch that followed the Aberdeenshire Canal from Kittybrewster to a terminus at Waterloo by the docks. The line was opened to goods traffic on 24 September 1855 and passengers on 1 April 1856. Kittybrewster station was rebuilt with through platforms and the offices moved to Waterloo station from premises at 75 Union Street. The stations were apart and a goods line was built though the docks linking the two railways, worked by horses as steam locomotives were prohibited. The Inverness & Nairn Railway was authorised in 1854 to build a railway from Inverness to Nairn. The Great North, still seeking to reach Inverness, had objected but withdrew after running rights over the railway were promised. The line was opened on 6 November 1855, and Inverness & Elgin Junction Railway was formed to extend this line to Elgin. The Great North objected again, this time citing the expense of crossing the Spey, but withdrew after it was suggested that the cost of a bridge would be shared. The new company changed its name to Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, but no final undertaking on running rights was made. The extension of the Great North to Keith was opened on 10 October 1856, with two intermediate stations at and Grange. Initially five services a day ran between Aberdeen and Keith, taking between 2 hours 40 minutes and 3 hours 5 minutes, although the number of services was later reduced to four. The route between Nairn and Keith authorised on 21 July 1856 required less earthwork, reducing cost, but had steeper gradients than had originally been proposed, and the Great North contributed £40,000 towards a bridge over the Spey. The line reached Dalvey (near Forres) in 1857, and Keith on 18 August 1858. Three services a day ran the between Aberdeen and Inverness, increasing to five a day east of Keith, and the journey to Inverness took between 5 hours and 55 minutes and 6 hours 30 minutes. The Great North did not insist on running rights west of Keith, but through carriages were probably provided from the start. =Expansion, 1854–1866= Formartine and Buchan Railway Permission to build a line to serve the fishing ports at Peterhead and Fraserburgh was received in 1846, but this lapsed during the financial collapse that had followed. Two rival bills were presented in 1856, one by the Formartine and Buchan Railway and backed by the Great North, and another by the Aberdeen, Peterhead & Fraserburgh Railway. Both companies failed to obtain permission for two years, but in 1858 the Formartine and Buchan Railway was successful. A long railway from Dyce to Old Deer (renamed in 1867) opened on 18 July 1861 and the main line between Kittybrewster and Dyce was doubled. The branch was extended the to a station at Peterhead the following year and a long branch north from to Fraserburgh station opened on 24 April 1865. Three or four services a day ran between Aberdeen, Fraserburgh and Peterhead, with the trains dividing at Maud; travel times were between and hours. The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866. Alford Valley Railway The Alford Valley Railway left the main line at Kintore for . The railway was authorised in 1856 with the backing of the Great North; most of the company's directors were also on the board of the Great North. The line was steeply graded over a summit at Tillyfourie, at between 1 in 70 and 1 in 75. The line opened in 1859 with a service of four trains a day calling at , and . In 1862 the Great North guaranteed the company's debts and it was subsequently absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866. Inverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway The branch from Inverurie, backed by local residents with funding from the Great North, was authorised on 15 June 1855. The official opening took place on 26 June 1856 with public services starting on 1 July. Journeys took from 18 to 20 minutes to cover the to Old Meldrum with a stop at ; a further station opened in 1866 at . In June 1858 the line was leased to the Great North for a rental of £650 per year (). The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866. Banff, Macduff and Turriff Railways Plans to reach fishing ports at Macduff and Banff from Inverurie were proposed when the Great North was first suggested, but failed because of the lack of financial support. A different route, from Milton Inveramsay, allowed for a shorter route with easier gradients. Unable to raise sufficient money for a line to the coast, a shorter line to was built. The Great North invested in the railway, and directors sat on the board of the Junction Railway. The new line, together with a junction station at , opened on 5 September 1857. A separate company, the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Extension Railway, built an extension to a station called . The line was operated by the Great North from 4 June 1860, and served an inconvenient terminus high on a hill from Macduff and from the bridge across the River Deveron to Banff. Four trains a day ran from Inveramsay, taking between 1 hour 30 minutes and 1 hour 50 minutes, with connections with services to Aberdeen. Both railways were absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866, and the line was extended to a new station in 1872. Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway Banff station in 1964 The railway was authorised in 1857 from Grange, on the Great North main line, to Banff, with a branch from to . The chairman of the company, Thomas Bruce, was also deputy chairman of the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, with the other directors being made up of local men; most of the investments were raised locally and in small amounts. Most of the line was built with gradients up to 1 in 70, but the half-mile of 1 in 30 goods line to the harbour at Portsoy was restricted to one locomotive and four wagons. The railway opened on 30 July 1859, with public services starting on 2 August following a derailment on the opening day. Services connected with the Great North at Grange. With the railway struggling to pay the interest on its debt, in 1863 the Great North took over running the services and the line renamed the Banffshire Railway. The Great North provided three trains a day between Grange and Banff that connected at Tillynaught for Portsoy, and two trains a day along the coast between Banff and Portsoy. Permission for a extension from Portsoy to Portgordon was given, but the necessary investment could not be found. Amalgamation with the Great North was authorised in 1866, but financial problems delayed this until 12 August 1867, and the Portgordon extension was abandoned. Keith and Dufftown Railway The Great North sought to have its own route west of Keith, with Grantown-on-Spey as an objective, where it hoped to meet any possible line between Perth and Inverness. To this end, it invested in the Keith and Dufftown Railway; this company was incorporated on 27 July 1857, but lack of money slowed progress. Powers for a longer, but cheaper, route between the two towns were secured on 25 May 1860. The revised route included steeper gradients than those planned in 1857; the maximum gradient was now 1 in 60 instead of 1 in 70. There was a viaduct over the Fiddich of two spans, and there were three intermediate stations: Earlsmill (renamed in 1897), Botriphnie (renamed in 1862) and . When the line opened on 21 February 1862, the trains were worked by the Great North under an agreement dating from the formation of the company. The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866. Strathspey Railway Blacksboat station in 1961 With promises of substantial goods traffic of iron and timber and from the local whisky distilleries, extension of the line to Dufftown into Strathspey was sought and obtained on 17 May 1861. The Strathspey Railway was sponsored by the Keith & Dufftown and Great North of Scotland Railways, who appointed directors to the board, and the Great North undertook to run the services. The line first headed north to meet an extension of the Morayshire Railway at Strathspey Junction (called from 1864), before following the River Spey to Abernethy. The Act also permitted a branch to the proposed Inverness & Perth Junction Railway at Grantown-on-Spey. The gradients were not severe, but the route required the Spey and its tributaries to be crossed many times, with three bridges built over the river itself. The line was placed in cuttings greater than deep, and there was one long tunnel. The line was opened on 1 July 1863 to Abernethy (later called ). The line between Dufftown and Craigellachie became the main line and services continued over the Morayshire Railway, opening up a route between Keith and independent of the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway (IAJR). The IAJR kept most of the through traffic as its line was more direct, only instead of via the Great North route. The Great North ran four trains a day from Elgin to Keith via Craigellachie, with through carriages or connections for three trains for Aberdeen at Keith. Connections at Elgin were poor because travel over the two routes took a different length of time. The line from Craigellachie became a branch with three trains a day calling at all stations at an average speed of about . The link to Grantown-on-Spey was not built, but on 1 August 1866 services were extended to meet the IAJR (now the Highland Railway) at . The railways met north of Boat and conflict arose over the manning of the signalbox at the junction, with the Highland refusing to make any contribution. For a while between March and June 1868 Great North services terminated at Nethy Bridge, after which separate tracks side by side were provided for both companies to Boat. Prompt connections were available with the Great North at Craigellachie, but there was usually a long wait for connections with the Highland at Boat. The railway's was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866, and the line's main source of income came from the local distilleries. Morayshire Railway A double- track railway had been proposed from Lossiemouth to Craigellachie in 1841 and necessary permissions granted in 1846, the route having changed to take advantage of the proposed Great North of Scotland Railway between Elgin and Orton. The financial situation delayed construction, but work eventually started on the section from Lossiemouth to Elgin in 1851. The line opened on 10 August 1852 with a special train from Elgin to festivities in Lossiemouth. Public services started the next day with five services a day, each taking 15 minutes with two request stops. First and second class accommodation was provided at d and 1d a mile. However, it was the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway (IAJR) who was to build the line from Elgin to Orton; permission to build a branch from this line to Rothes was granted to the Morayshire on 14 July 1856. The IAJR built its own station at Elgin, linked to the Morayshire's station by a junction to the east. The IAJR opened on 18 August 1858 and the Morayshire Railway started running services on 23 August. The Elgin railway stations on the 1923 OS map. The horizontal west-east line is the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway. The Morayshire Railway lines north to Lossiemouth and south to Rothes used a separate station. The other line the east was built later by the Great North. Initially the Morayshire ran trains over the IAJR, but its lightweight locomotives struggled with the gradients and proved unreliable, and after six weeks carriages were attached and detached from IAJR trains at Elgin and Orton. Conflict arose over through ticketing, and the directors of the Morayshire responded with plans to build its own line between the two stations. The Great North sponsored the new line and offered to provide services after the lines had been physically connected. Permission was granted on 3 July 1860, goods were carried from 30 December 1861 and passengers from 1 January 1862, reducing the travel time from 55 minutes to 45 minutes. The Morayshire station at Elgin was enlarged in anticipation of Great North services, albeit in wood. In 1861 permission was granted to the Morayshire Railway to cross the Spey and join with the Strathspey Railway at Craigellachie. The Morayshire extension and the Strathspey both opened on 1 July 1863 and the Great North provided a service of four trains a day over the line, which gave an alternative route between Keith and Elgin. On 30 July 1866 permission was given to the Morayshire and Great North to amalgamate with agreement, and the loss-making services between Orton and Rothes were withdrawn without notice the following day. It would be August 1881 before the Morayshire became fully part of the Great North. Aberdeen joint station The wooden station building at Waterloo was a from the Aberdeen and Deeside's Guild Street station and passengers were conveyed between the termini by omnibus, paid for in the through fare and with forty five minutes being allowed for the transfer. The Great North refused to hold its trains to connect with those arriving at Guild Street and insisted that tickets were purchased at least five minutes before the train was due to depart. The mail train would be held until the Post Office van had arrived and the mail was on board, but the station locked at the advertised departure time to prevent connecting passengers further delaying the train. This inconvenienced passengers, as was pointed out to the general manager during a parliamentary committee meeting by a Member of Parliament who had missed a connection, although his family and luggage had been sent on. The Great North promoted onward traffic by sea and approached the Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company to see if rates could be reduced for through traffic and through ticketing by rail was not available until 1859, when the Great North joined the Railway Clearing House. The Aberdeen stations in 1869. The Great North of Scotland Railway Waterloo terminus is top right, and the Aberdeen Railway Guild Street terminus bottom left, beside the new through Aberdeen joint railway station. A joint line through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had approached the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached. The Limpet Mill Scheme was a line presented in an 1862 bill by the nominally independent Scottish Northern Junction Railway, but supported by the SNER. This proposed a long railway between Limpet Mill, to the north of on the SNER, to the Great North at Kintore. A junction with the Deeside Railway was also planned, over which the SNER unsuccessfully tried to obtain running rights. Unpopular, this was given permission by parliament, but the Great North succeeded in inserting a clause that this would be suspended if it obtained an Act by 1 September 1863. The Great North proposed a route, known locally as the Circumbendibus, that was longer but cheaper than the direct route through the Denburn Valley. Despite local opposition, the route was approved by parliament in 1863, but was revoked the following year when the SNER obtained permission for a railway through the Denburn Valley. The Great North contributed the £125,000 that its Circumbendibus line would have cost and the SNER contributed £70,000 out of the £90,000 it had been prepared to advance the Limpet Mill Scheme. The SNER built the double-track railway, culverting the Denburn and digging two short tunnels. The joint station opened on 4 November 1867 and consisted of three through tracks, one with a long platform, together with two bay platforms for terminating trains at either end. Two lines to the west were provided for goods traffic, and the stations at Waterloo and Guild Street closed to passengers and became goods terminals. The line to the north of the station passed to the Great North and the long Hutcheon Street tunnel became its longest. Deeside Railway A railway to serve Deeside was authorised on 16 July 1846, but it was decided to wait for the Aberdeen Railway to open first. The company survived after the railway mania as the Aberdeen Railway bought a large number of shares. Interest in the line was restored after Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle, to which the Royal Family made their first visit in 1848, and the Aberdeen Railway was able to sell its shares. Investors were still hard to find, but a line as far as Banchory was ceremonially opened on 7 September 1853; public services began the following day with three trains a day that took about an hour. First class accommodation was available for d a mile, reduced to 1d a mile for third class. Initially services were operated by the Aberdeen Railway to its terminus at Ferryhill, and the Deeside Railway used a horse to shunt wagons at Banchory. In 1854 the Deeside introduced its own rolling stock and ran through to the Aberdeen's Guild Street station which opened the same year. Ballater station, used by the Royal Family when they travelled to Balmoral, in 1966 A new company, the Aboyne Extension, was formed to reach . Instead of building two bridges across the Dee, as had been proposed in 1846, the railway instead took a cheaper but longer route through Lumphanan, and services were extended over the new line on 2 December 1859. The Aboyne & Braemar Railway was formed to build a line from Aboyne the to Braemar. The line was to follow the Dee before crossing it from Braemar, but the plans were modified to terminate the line at Bridge of Gairn with the passenger terminus short at . This route opened to Ballater on 17 October 1866, and the line to Bridge of Gairn remained unfinished. By 1855 there five services a day over the long line, taking between 1 hour 50 minutes and hours. The Royal Family used the line from 1853 to travel to Balmoral Castle; in September 1866 the British Royal Train used Ballater station nearly a month before public services reached the station. At first Queen Victoria visited once a year, this becoming twice a year after Albert died in 1861. The number of visits returned to one a year after Edward VII became king in 1901. From 8 October 1865 a daily 'Messenger Train' ran when the Royal Family was at Balmoral. First class accommodation was available on these trains; accompanying servants were charged third class fares. In the late 1850s and early 1860s the Great North and the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER) were in conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen. Frustrated with lack of progress, the SNER proposed a new line that crossed the Deeside Railway. Whilst in discussions with the SNER about a link from this new line to the Deeside, a lease for the Deeside Railway was offered to the Great North, which was rapidly accepted. The Deeside board accepted the lease by a majority vote on 13 May 1862, and it was approved by Parliament on 30 July 1866. The Aboyne & Braemar remained independent, although services were operated by the Great North. Amalgamation After opening to Keith in 1854 the Great North of Scotland Railway operated over of line. Ten years later this had almost quadrupled but more than three-quarters was over leased or subsidiary railways. Eventual amalgamation with many of these railways had been prompted from the start. The necessary authority was sought and on 30 July 1866 the Great North of Scotland Railway (Amalgamation) Act received Royal Assent, this Act also permitting the Great North to lease the Deeside Railway. The other companies merged two days later, except the Banffshire and Morayshire, which had started as separate undertakings and were not included in the 1866 Act, although permission for the Banffshire to merge was gained the following year. After the extension of the Deeside opened in 1866 and the merger of the Banffshire the following year the Great North of Scotland Railway owned of line and operated over a further . =Austerity, 1866–1879= In 1855, the first full year after opening, the Great North of Scotland declared a dividend of per cent, which rose to the following year and 5 per cent in 1859. The dividend reached a maximum of per cent in 1862 before dropping to 7 per cent the following year and 5 per cent in 1864, but in 1865 the directors could not pay any dividend on ordinary shares. At the directors' suggestion a committee was set up to look into their actions; the report's main recommendation was the abandonment of the Port Gordon extension. The opening of direct route over the Highland Railway to the south had lost the through mail business, resulting in the withdrawal of Sunday services, and had lost revenue equivalent to a five per cent dividend. Joining the Clearing House system had resulted in the loss of twenty-five per cent of goods traffic income and the conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen had been expensive and resulted in an overpriced lease on the Deeside. The collapse of Overend, Gurney and Company Bank in 1866 meant that for three months the bank rate rose to 10 per cent, making the company's financial situation worse. The whole board resigned and six members did not seek re-appointment. At the beginning of 1867 the company owed £800,000 () and the new board imposed austerity measures. It would be 1874 before most of the company's debt was settled and it became possible to pay a dividend again. The only line built in the early 70s was the to Macduff and few carriages and no locomotives were built until 1876. The Deeside Railway merged in 1875, the Aboyne & Braemar extension to Ballater in January 1876, and the Morayshire Railway was absorbed in 1880. After an engine boiler exploded at Nethy Bridge in September 1878, the inquiry found the testing of boilers infrequent and inadequate. It was sixteen months before the locomotive was repaired. =Renaissance, 1879–1899= William Ferguson, Chairman of the Great North of Scotland Railway 1878–1904 Renewal and extension In 1879 the Chairman, Lord Provost Leslie, died and was replaced by William Ferguson of Kinmundy. The following year both the Secretary and General Manager resigned and William Moffatt was appointed to both posts, and A.G. Reid became Superintendent of the Line. The railway was now paying a dividend and seeing increased traffic, but rolling stock, track, signals and stations all needed replacing in a project that was to cost £250,000 (). By June 1880 the main line was doubled as far as Kintore, and over the next five years of iron rail track, much of it without fishplates, was replaced with steel rails and the main line doubled to Inveramsay. The railway had acquired a reputation for running slow trains on a perverse timetable and ill-treating its passengers, and now resolved to address this. By the mid-1880s services were faster, there was upholstery in third class and the branches saw an accelerated service as a result of running fewer mixed trains. On 27 November 1882 Inverythan Bridge on the Macduff Branch near collapsed as a locomotive hauling five goods wagons, a brake van and four carriages crossed. The locomotive and tender crossed the bridge, but the wagons and carriages fell to the road below, killing five people who had been travelling in the first and second carriages and injuring fifteen others. The Board of Trade report found that the collapse was due to an internal fault in a cast iron beam that had been fitted when the bridge had been built in 1857. A bill was introduced to parliament in 1881 to extend the line from Portsoy along the Moray Firth to Buckie, to be opposed by the Highland and rejected. The following year both the Great North and Highland railways applied to parliament, the Great North for a line from Portsoy along the coast through Buckie to Elgin, and the Highland for a branch from Keith to Buckie and Cullen. Authority was granted, but in the case of the Highland Railway only for a line as far as Portessie, with running rights over the Great North coast line between Buckie and Portsoy and the Great North obtaining reciprocal rights over the Highland railway between Elgin and Forres. The coast line opened in stages, the outer sections from Portsoy to Tochieneal and Elgin to Garmouth opening in 1884. The centre section, which involved heavy engineering, with a long viaduct with a central span of over the Spey at Garmouth and embankments and viaducts at Cullen, opened in May 1886. The line was served by four trains a day and a fast through train from Aberdeen that reached Elgin in hours. The Highland Portessie branch had opened in 1884 and the Highland did not exercise its running rights over the Coast Line, thus preventing the Great North running over its lines west of Elgin. The Great North had opened using a system of telegraphic train orders, and as the signalling was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens in a process that frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens were exchanged at , but soon they were exchanged at line speed. After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all single-line sections. Aberdeen to Inverness The Great North and Highland had agreed in 1865 that Keith would be the exchange point for traffic between the two railways, but in 1886 the Great North had two lines to Elgin that, although longer than the Highland's direct line, served more populous areas. The coastal route between Keith and Elgin was long but had easier gradients than the via Craigellachie. The Highland's main line south from Inverness was via Forres, the Great North believing that their competitors treated the line to Elgin as a branch. In 1883 a shorter route south from Inverness was promoted by an independent company, the bill defeated in parliament only after the Highland had promised to request authority for a shorter line. The following year, as well as the Highland's more direct line from Aviemore, the Great North proposed a branch from its Speyside Section to Inverness. The Highland Railway route was chosen, but the Great North won a concession that goods and passengers that could be exchanged at any junction with through bookings and with services conveniently arranged. Garmouth. In 1885 the Great North re-timed the 10:10 am Aberdeen service to reach Keith at 11:50 am with through carriages that reached Elgin via Craigellachie at 1 pm. This connected with a Highland service at both Keith and Elgin, until the Highland re-timed the train and broke the connection at Elgin. The Great North applied to the Board of Trade for an order for two connections a day at Elgin. This was refused, but in 1886 the Great North and Highland railways came to an agreement to pool receipts from the stations between Grange and Elgin and refer any disputes to an arbiter. The midday Highland train was re-timed to connect with the Great North at Keith and Elgin, and a service connected at Elgin with an Aberdeen train that had divided en route to travel via the coast and Craigellachie. In 1893 the Highland cancelled the traffic agreement and withdrew two connecting trains, complaining that they were unprofitable. One of the trains was reinstated after an appeal was made to the Railway & Canal Commissioners and a frustrated Great North applied to parliament in 1895 for running powers to Inverness, but withdrew after it was agreed that the Railway & Canal Commissioners would arbitrate in the matter. With no judgement by 1897, the Great North prepared to apply again for running powers over the Highland to Inverness, this time agreeing to double track the line, but the commissioners published their finding before the bill was submitted to parliament. Traffic was to be exchanged at both Elgin and Keith, the services exchanged at Elgin needed to include through carriages from both the Craigellachie and the coast routes, and the timetable had to be approved by the commissioners. The resulting Commissioners' Service started in 1897 with eight through services, four via the Highland to Keith taking between and 5 hours, and four with carriages exchanged at Elgin with portions that travelled via Craigellachie and the coast, two of these taking hours. The 3 pm from Inverness to Aberdeen via Keith took 3 hours 5 minutes. Initially portions for the coast and Craigellachie divided at Huntly, but Cairnie Platform was opened at Grange Junction in summer 1898. The main line was double track to Huntly in 1896 and Keith in 1898, except for a single-track bridge over the Deveron between Avochie and Rothiemay, which was replaced by a double-track bridge in 1900. Subbies and hotels In 1880 an express was introduced on the Deeside Line, taking 90 minutes to travel from Aberdeen to Ballater; by 1886 this had reduced to 75 minutes. In 1887 the service between Aberdeen and Dyce had improved with more local trains and new stations; by the end of that year there were twelve trains a day, eventually becoming twenty trains a day calling at nine stops in twenty minutes. The trains were initially called the Jubilees, as it was Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, but became known as the Subbies. Suburban services were also introduced between Aberdeen and Culter on the Deeside Line in 1894, after the track had been doubled, starting with ten down and nine up trains calling at seven stops in twenty-two minutes. The number of trains was eventually doubled and an additional station provided. In 1891 the company offices were moved from Waterloo to a new building in Guild Street with direct access to the station. The same year the Great North took over the Palace Hotel (closed after a fire in 1941),history of Aberdeen hotels near the joint railway station in Aberdeen and modernised it, installing electric lighting and building a covered way between the hotel and station. Encouraged by its success, the company obtained permission in 1893 to build an hotel and golf course at Cruden Bay, about north of Aberdeen. The hotel was linked to the Great North by the Boddam Branch, a new single-track branch from Ellon, on the Buchan section, which served Cruden Bay and fishing town at Boddam. The line opened in 1897 with services from Ellon taking about forty minutes. The hotel opened in 1899, connected to the railway station by the Cruden Bay Hotel Tramway. This was nearly long, with a gauge of and operated by electric tramcars that took power from an overhead line. Seasonal through services to Aberdeen began in 1899 with an up service in the morning; for some years an afternoon up service returned in the evening. Excursions for tourists had operated on the Deeside Line from 1881, later joined by special services on the Strathspey Line and the Coast Line alongside the Moray Firth, promoted as the Scottish Riviera. =Maturity, 1900–1914= There was interest at the end of the 19th century in using the new Light Railways Act 1896 to approve lines to serve rural areas. The long Aberdeenshire Light Railway was independently promoted in 1896 to serve Skene and Echt, with tracks laid along the public roads in Aberdeen. The Great North proposed an alternative Echt Light Railway and a line to Newburgh that would both use the Aberdeen tramway tracks in the city. In 1897 a line from Echt to Aberdeen was approved, but only as far the city outskirts after opposition to laying tracks in the public roads or using the tramways for goods traffic. The plans were changed to connect the line with the Great North at Kittybrewster, but the scheme abandoned after the costs had started to rise. The Great North was granted a Light Railway Order on 8 September 1899 for a light railway from Fraserburgh to St Combs. The Order included a clause, unusual for the time, permitting the use of electric traction; but the company opted for steam traction, and the locomotives were fitted with cowcatchers as the line was unfenced. Services started on 1 July 1903, with six trains a day that took 17 minutes to complete the journey. A light railway was proposed to cover the from Fraserburgh to Rosehearty, but the scheme was abandoned after opposition to laying tracks on the public road. The Great North's Elgin station, rebuilt in 1902, still stands today and is a Category B listed building Finding its locomotive works at Kittybrewster cramped and inadequate, the Great North began construction on a new works at Inverurie in 1898, electric lighting being provided in the buildings. The carriage and wagon department moved in 1901, the locomotive department in 1902, the offices the following year and the permanent way department in 1905; the buildings still stand and are listed Category B. Inverurie station was rebuilt nearer the works in 1902, and is similarly a Category B building. The Great North built houses nearby for its staff, lit by electricity generated at the works, and the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club was formed by staff in 1902. Republished online by the Inverurie Loco Works FC. Archived from the original on 7 October 2013. Retrieved 7 October 2013. The Great North rebuilt Elgin station in 1902 to replace a temporary wooden building dating from the 1860s, a joint structure with the adjacent station having been declined by the Highland Railway. Following negotiations, amalgamation of the Highland and the Great North of Scotland Railways was accepted by the Great North shareholders in early 1906, but the Highland board withdrew after opposition from a minority of its shareholders. The Aberdeen and Inverness trains were jointly worked after 1908 and locomotives were no longer exchanged at Keith or Elgin; between 1914 and 1916 the Highland paid the Great North to provide locomotives for all of the services through to Inverness. In spring 1904 the Great North began a motor omnibus service to Braemar, connecting with trains at Ballater. These early buses had solid tyres and a legal speed limit of , but were faster than the horse-drawn coaches they replaced. By 1907 buses connected with Great North train services and conveyed passengers to Strathdon, Midmar, Echt, Cluny Castle and Aberchirder, between Cock Bridge and Tomintoul a horse-drawn coach was used as the motor buses could not ascend the steep road. Services from Aberdeen connected with trains at , where a refreshment room was built. In 1914 the railway had 35 passenger road vehicles that, together with 15 five-ton lorries, worked daily. Aberdeen joint station was congested, resulting in delayed trains, and the low, open platforms were frequently covered in oily slime due to the large quantities of fish that passed through. Agreement with the Caledonian Railway over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the goods station to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms on the western side opened and the adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. Foundations for the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920. =War and grouping, 1914–1922= With Britain's declaration of war on the German Empire on 4 August 1914, the government took control of the railways under the Regulation of the Forces Act 1871. Day-to-day operations were left in the control of local management, but movements necessary for the war were coordinated by a committee of general managers. The Great North of Scotland's main role was providing a relief route when the Highland Railway route south to Perth was congested, on one Sunday conveying twenty-one troop specials from Keith to Aberdeen. Timber from the forests of the north of Scotland were carried from sidings at Kemnay, Knockando and Nethy Bridge. A total of 609 staff left to serve in the war, and a memorial to the 93 who died in action was erected at the offices in Aberdeen. Services were maintained until 1916, when staff shortages reduced services, although no lines were closed. GNSR War Memorial, Aberdeen Railway Station The railways were in a poor state after the war, costs having increased, with higher wages, the introduction of an eight- hour day and increased price of coal. A scheme was devised whereby the railways would be grouped into four large companies; this was approved by parliament as the Railways Act 1921. At the start of the 20th century the company's shares had been restructured; the final dividends were 3 per cent on preferred stock, unaltered from previously, and per cent on ordinary stock, slightly above average. Before grouping the Great North of Scotland Railway operated of track. =London and North Eastern Railway= On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland became an isolated part of the Scottish division of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), the Caledonian to the south and Highland to the west both becoming part of a different group, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. That summer a sleeping carriage operated between Lossiemouth and , and a through carriage ran from to Cruden Bay on Fridays. Sunday services were re-introduced; from 1928 Aberdeen suburban services ran hourly during the afternoon and evenings. Afterwards the economic situation deteriorated and the railway companies advised the trade unions in 1928 that wages would need to be cut; this was implemented in August 1930 after the Wall Street Crash the previous year. Economy measures were introduced and unprofitable passenger services withdrawn, the Oldmeldrum branch closing on 2 November 1931 and the branch to Cruden Bay and Boddam on 31 October 1932. Road transport was arranged for guests at the Cruden Bay hotel, from Ellon for the first summer season, and then from Aberdeen. LNER Gresley bogie carriages were in use on former Great North services by 1937 Carriages were transferred in to replace the older four-wheelers, former North Eastern Railway vehicles in 1924–25 and fifty former Great Eastern Railway six-wheelers between 1926 and 1929 for the Aberdeen suburban services. By 1936 more up to date Gresley bogie carriages were used on the primary trains. Optimism returned and traffic increased after 1933, and a luxury rail land cruise, the \\"Northern Belle\\", ran over former Great North lines. However, the Aberdeen subbies had been losing money for some time as a result of competition from the local buses, and from 5 April 1937 the local services between Aberdeen, Dyce and Culter were withdrawn and most of the intermediate stations closed. The railways were again placed under government control on 1 September 1939, and Britain was at war two days later. The Cruden Bay Hotel was used as an army hospital and the tramway ceased operating in 1941. Handed back to the railway in 1945, it never reopened. The Palace Hotel burnt down in 1941. The Station Hotel was used as an admiralty administrative centre, and reopened in 1950 after refurbishment. =British Railways= Britain's railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and the former Great North of Scotland Railway lines were placed under the control of the Scottish Region of British Railways. To reduce costs the Alford branch was closed to passengers on 2 January 1950, followed by the Macduff Branch on 1 October 1951. Cross Country DMU at Inverness in 1968 The 1955 Modernisation Plan, known formally as the \\"Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways\\", was published in December 1954, and with the aim of increasing speed and reliability the steam trains were replaced with electric and diesel traction. In 1958 a battery-electric railcar was introduced on the Deeside Line and a diesel railbus on the Speyside Section. Diesel Multiple Units (DMU) took over services to Peterhead and Fraserburgh in 1959 and from 1960 cross-country types were used on an accelerated Aberdeen to Inverness service that allowed hours for four stops. By 1961 the only service still using steam locomotives was the branch from Tillynaught to Banff. In 1963 Dr Beeching published his report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\", which recommended closing the network's least used stations and lines. Only the Aberdeen to Keith main line survived, albeit without its stopping services and the remaining former Great North lines closed to passengers. The Lossiemouth and Banff branch closed in 1964 and the following year the St Combs branch, line from Dyce to Peterhead and Fraserburgh and the Speyside section closed and local services to Inverurie were withdrawn. Attempts to save the Deeside section to Banchory failed and it closed in 1966. On 6 May 1968 services were withdrawn on the Coast Line, the former Great North line via Craigellachie and the local services between Aberdeen and Elgin. The Beeching Report had recommended Inverurie and Insch stations for closure, but these were saved by the subsequent inquiry. The goods service at individual stations was also withdrawn after Beeching's report. A freightliner depot opened at Aberdeen in 1966, allowing the Peterhead line to close completely on 7 September 1970. In 1969–70 the line between Aberdeen and Keith was singled, with passing loops, the line to Fraserburgh closing completely in 1979 and that from Keith to Dufftown in 1985. In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. The cross-country DMUs were replaced in 1980 by diesel locomotives hauling Mark I compartment coaches, later Mark II open saloons. These were similarly replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by newer DMUs, first the Class 156 Super Sprinter and then Class 158 Express and Class 170 units. =Legacy= Deeside way at Garthdee The Aberdeen to Inverness Line currently uses the former Great North of Scotland Railway line as far Keith with stations at Dyce, Inverurie, Insch, Huntly and Keith. Eleven trains a day run between Aberdeen and Inverness, taking about hours, supplemented between Aberdeen and Inverurie by approximately the same number of local trains. In a project scheduled for completion in 2030, the line is to be improved to allow a regular hourly Aberdeen to Inverness service, additional commuter trains into Inverness and Aberdeen and new stations at Kintore and Dalcross, near Inverness airport. Heritage and tourist railways also use the former Great North of Scotland Railway alignment. The Keith and Dufftown Railway runs seasonal services over the between Keith Town and Dufftown using Class 108 diesel multiple units. The Strathspey Railway operates seasonal services over the former Highland Railway route from to Grantown-on-Spey via the joint Highland and Great North Boat of Garten station. The Royal Deeside Railway operates over of former Deeside Railway at Milton of Crathes near Banchory during summer weekends and in December, and based at Alford railway station is the Alford Valley Railway, which seasonally operates a narrow gauge railway. Former alignments have been opened as long distance rail trails for pedestrians, cyclists and horses. The Formartine and Buchan Way runs from Dyce to Maud before dividing to follow the two branches to Peterhead and Fraserburgh. The Deeside Way is open between Aberdeen and Kincardine O'Neil and Aboyne and Ballater. Nestrans (The North East of Scotland Transport Partnership), the organization responsible for local transport strategy, consider that building new railways along these routes would not be beneficial at the moment but the alignments are protected from development. The Speyside Way, one of Scotland's Long Distance Routes, mostly follows the route of the Speyside section between Craigellachie and Ballindalloch and Grantown and Nethy Bridge. Rolling stock =Locomotives= Early locomotives One of the locomotives built in 1866 The first locomotives were 2-4-0 tender engines, built by Wm Fairbairn in Manchester to the design of the locomotive superintendent Daniel Kinnear Clark. Twelve were ordered for the opening of the first line, seven passenger and five goods. They were all fitted with Clark's patent smoke preventing system that improved fuel economy and painted green with black borders, and red buffer beams. There was no protection for the driver or fireman and braking was by wooden blocks on the four wheels of the tender. The railway opened with only five locomotives, and within days one had been seriously damaged in the collision at and a second had a mechanical fault. Two more locomotives had arrived by the end of 1854, and the order was complete by summer 1855. Four more passenger locomotives were ordered in 1857, weatherboards and sanding equipment had been fitted by 1860, and cabs added in the 1880s. John Folds Ruthven replaced Clark in 1855 and an order was placed with Beyer, Peacock & Co. for two 0-4-0 tank engines to bank trains on the line to Waterloo near Aberdeen harbour. After William Cowan became locomotive superintendent nine more locomotives arrived in 1859–61. These were followed by nine 4-4-0s, also built by R. Stephenson & Co., and delivered between 1862 and 1864. Six more powerful 4-4-0 locomotives arrived from Neilsons in 1866, and were fitted with a more modern bogie. Three passed to the London and North Eastern Railway after the 1923 Grouping, and No. 45 hauled a train at the Railway Centenary celebrations in 1925 before being scrapped. In 1863 the Great North took over the operation of the Banffshire and Morayshire Railways and absorbed their locomotives. The Banffshire had four locomotives, two 0-4-2 tanks, named \\"Banff\\" and \\"Portsoy\\", built by Hawthorns of Leith for the line's opening in 1859. The other two locomotives were 0-4-2 tender engines, one bought secondhand from the Scottish Central Railway, having been built in 1848 by the Vulcan Foundry in Warrington and named \\"Keith\\", and a similar tender engine built by Hawthorns. The Morayshire Railway had started services in 1852 with two 2-2-0 engines designed by James Samuel and built by Neilsons. The locomotives had proved inadequate and were replaced by two larger 2-4-0 tank engines. The Great North took over the operation of the Deeside Railway in 1866. Its first two locomotives were 0-4-2 tank engines, built by Hawthorns and arrived in 1854. No. 3, a tender locomotive, was delivered in 1854 from Dodds & Son of Rotherham, but this had mechanical defects and was never satisfactory. Between 1857 and 1866 four 0-4-2 tender locomotives arrived from Hawthorns; these were similar to the Banffshire's Nos. 3 and 4; the Deeside also bought the Banffshire's No. 4 in 1864. One of these locomotives was given a large six-wheeled tender to allow it to haul the Royal Trains from Aberdeen to without stopping. The tender locomotives were found to be unstable at high speeds were all withdrawn by 1880. Class O No. 17 The company's financial difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives were built in 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and were the first to be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a superheater. Most of Manson's later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild. Class S and later In 1890 Manson was replaced as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, the son of Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so they were the same as the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900. LNER 2251, built by the Great North as Class T No. 107, is seen here shunting at Elgin in 1948. William Pickersgill replaced Johnson in 1894, and between 1895 and 1898 twenty-six new locomotives were purchased from Neilsons. Similar to Johnson's Class S, they were recorded at speeds of and running the from to in 23 minutes 46 seconds. A further order for ten was placed in 1899, but train mileage had been reduced and five were sold to the South Eastern & Chatham Railway. Pickersgill saw the works move from Kittybrewster to Inverurie before Thomas Heywood took over in 1914, three months before the outbreak of war. The railway took over the working of the Aberdeen harbour railway and in 1915 purchased four 0-4-2 tank locomotives from Manning Wardle. After the war, six more locomotives were built in 1920 by the North British Locomotive Company, and two locomotives the following year at Inverurie. Similar to the 1899 locomotives but with Robinson superheaters, these were given names. Heywood changed the livery during the war, and the traditional green being replaced by black lined with yellow and red. On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland became a part of the Scottish division of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), who received a total of 122 locomotives, 100 4-4-0 tender locomotives and 22 tank engines, all capable of being used on either passenger or goods trains. Forty-four locomotives were still in service when the railway was nationalised in 1948, and the last two Great North locomotives to be withdrawn were two of the Aberdeen harbour tanks in 1960. No. 49, Gordon Highlander was restored to Great North green in 1958, although it had not previously carried the green livery as it appeared in Heywood's lined black. It was used on special trains before becoming a static exhibit at the Glasgow Transport Museum in 1965, and is currently on loan to the Scottish Railway Museum at Bo'ness. =Carriages= A train of old Great North carriages at the Railway Centenary at Darlington in 1925 The first carriages were four-wheelers, long. Painted a dark brown with yellow lining and lettering, they had Newall's chain brake and a seat for the guard on the roof. Two classes of accommodation were provided: the first class carriages were divided into three compartments each with six upholstered seats and lit by two oil lamps hung between the partitions. Third class passengers were seated on wooden benches in a carriage seating 40 passengers sharing one oil lamp. The Great North never owned any second class carriages. Built by Brown, Marshall & Co, only half the number of carriages ordered had arrived for the start of public services in 1854. Later the guard's seat was removed and longer vehicles with six wheels were built. Accommodation for third class passengers was improved in the 1880s and the seats were upholstered. The Westinghouse air brake was trialled on carriages in the 1880s and this became standard in 1891. As the Highland Railway used vacuum brakes, carriages used on the Aberdeen to Inverness were dual-fitted. The livery changed in the late 1890s, when the upper half was painted cream and the lower purple lake, with gold lining and lettering. Corridor carriages, long on six wheels, lit with electric lamps using Stone's system and with both classes having access to a lavatory appeared in 1896. Bogie corridor carriages, long and weighing were built for the Aberdeen to Inverness express in 1898 with provision for vestibule connections. The Great North also had Royal Saloon carriage that, unusually for the Great North, was built with a clerestory roof. This was long, lit by electric lamps and with steam heating, and divided into a first class compartment and an attendant's coupe, which was fitted with a cooking stove. Later, shorter six-wheeled and bogie compartment carriages were built for secondary services, and communication cords and steam heating were fitted in the early years of the twentieth century. No. 34, a 6-wheel carriage built in the 1890s is preserved at the Embsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway as part of the Stately Trains collection. In 1905 the Great North introduced two articulated steam railcars. The locomotive unit was mounted on four wheels, one pair driven and with the Cochran patent boiler that was common on stationary engines, but an unusual design for a locomotive. The saloon carriage accommodated 46 third class passengers on reversible lath-and-space seats and a position for the driver with controls using cables over the carriage roof. The cars were introduced on the Lossiemouth branch and the St Combs Light Railway, but when in motion there was considerable vibration that was uncomfortable for the passengers and caused problems for the steam engine. Before they were withdrawn in 1909–10, one was tried on Deeside suburban services, but had insufficient accommodation and was unable to maintain the schedule. Constituent railways The Great North of Scotland Railway absorbed the following railways in 1866: *Aberdeen and Turriff Railway had been the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway prior to 1859. The Great North supported the railway, operated the services from opening and was guarantor from 1862. *Banff, Macduff and Turriff Extension Railway extended the Aberdeen and Turriff from Turriff. Services were extended by the Great North over the new line from opening. *Most of the Alford Valley Railway's directors also served on the board of the Great North, which operated services from opening and was guarantor from 1862. *Formartine and Buchan Railway was worked by the Great North from opening in 1861, with services from Aberdeen. The Great North was guarantor from 1863. *Inverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway opened in 1856, the line was leased to the Great North from 1858. *Keith and Dufftown Railway was worked as an extension of the main line, services operated by the Great North from opening in 1862. *Strathspey Railway was sponsored by the Great North, which operated services from opening. These companies operated by the Great North in 1866 were merged later: *Banffshire Railway had been Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway when it opened in 1859, the Great North taking over the operation of services from 1863 and the company renamed. Amalgamation was authorised in an 1867 Act. *Deeside Railway leased from 1 September 1866, merged 1 August 1875. *Aboyne & Braemar Railway was the extension of the Deeside to Ballater, and was operated by the Great North from its opening on 17 October 1866. Merged 31 January 1876. *Morayshire Railway was opened in 1852, worked by the Great North from 1863 when the extension to Craigellachie opened. The 1866 Act provided for the merging of the two companies when terms where agreed, and the companies were merged in 1880.

The new company would have McDonnell Douglas as the majority shareholder (51%) with Taiwan Aerospace (40%) and other Asian companies (9%) having the remaining shares. =MD-12= Artist's impression of the MD-12 In late 1991, McDonnell Douglas made a move to separate its civil and military divisions in a bid to raise the estimated $4 billion development costs needed to develop the MD-12X trijet. Separating the costly military C-17 airlifter development, which had been a drain on the company's resources, from the profit-making production of the MD-80 and MD-11 airliners would make it easier to attract foreign investors for the MD-12X.\\"MD-12 divides Douglas.\\" Flight International, November 13–19, 1991.

The fuselage was wide by high. McDonnell Douglas unveiled its MD-12 design in April 1992. The design was similar in concept to the Airbus A3XX and Boeing New Large Airplane, and it would have been larger than the Boeing 747 with which it would have directly competed. Douglas Aircraft had also studied a smaller double decker design in the 1960s.Berek, D. \\"Proposed double deck DC-10 design in 1965.\\" webshots.com, April 4, 2004.

The first flight of the MD-12 was to take place in late 1995, with delivery in 1997. Despite aggressive marketing and initial excitement, especially in the aviation press, no orders were placed for the aircraft. MDC lacked the resources after Taiwan Aerospace left the project. Some skeptics believed that MDC launched the project to lure Boeing into paying a higher price for the company. A new double deck widebody has proved to be extremely expensive and complex to develop, even for the remaining aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus, although the massive Airbus A380, a similar concept to the MD-12, was later brought to fruition.\\"Airbus will lose €4.8bn because of A380 delays.\\" Times Online, October 4, 2006. =MD-XX= With the MD-12 program over, McDonnell Douglas focused on 300 to 400–seat MD-11 derivatives.

Since November 2011, it has also been available as a podcast. Structure Four regular panellists discuss moral and ethical issues raised by a recent news story. Michael Buerk delivers a preamble launching the topic, then a series of 'witnesses' - experts or other relevant people - are questioned by the panellists, who then discuss what each witness said. Panellists The regular panellists are: * Nazir Afzal * Andrew Doyle * Giles Fraser * Nesrine Malik * Anne McElvoy * Melanie Phillips * Mona Siddiqui * Tim Stanley * Matthew Taylor Notable former panellists include Rabbi Hugo Gryn (who died in 1996), Janet Daley, Edward Pearce, Geoffrey Robertson, Michael Mansfield, politician Michael Gove, Claire Fox, Ian Hargreaves, Kenan Malik, scientist Steven Rose, philosophers Simon Blackburn and Roger Scruton, and historian David Starkey, who often attracted controversy for his allegedly blunt manner. History The first programme on Monday 20 August 1990 was forty minutes long from 11am, and followed by Poetry Please. It was made by the Factual Unit of Religious Programmes (later called Factual Programmes Religion) at BBC North in Manchester. It was hoped that the programme format would involve the panellists' views being revised during the course of a programme, but this rarely happened. In April 1991, it had moved to Tuesdays, and followed the 9am news, until 9:45am (a slot similar to the current In Our Time). In July 1991, it had moved to 8:05pm until 8:50pm on Fridays, replacing Any Questions? for the summer recess. There was then a repeat at 1pm on the following Saturday, and a phone-in from 2 to 2:30pm, replacing Any Answers?. There was also an end-of-year programme. In July 1992, it had moved to Thursday mornings following the 9am news. It became a de rigueur listen for Westminster MPs. By 1997, it was fifty-five minutes long, lasting until 10am. It moved to Wednesday evenings from 13 May 1998 in the 1998 schedule changes, with a repeat of the forty-five-minute programme on Saturday night at 10:15pm. Michael Buerk has presented the programme since August 1990. David Aaronovitch presents occasional episodes during Buerk's absence. Originally produced at the BBC North West's New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in Manchester, the programme production base is Salford Quays. The programme is broadcast live from BBC Broadcasting House in London. =TV pilot= In early 1994, a television version was considered, which eventually took off on Saturday 10 September 1994 on BBC2 as a trial series of six 45-minute-long programmes broadcast around midnight, perhaps influenced by Channel 4's successful late- night discussion programme After Dark. The pilot had audiences of around 1.3 million. It was last broadcast on 15 October 1994 at 11pm. Criticism In his book Bad Thoughts (US title Crimes Against Logic), libertarian philosopher Jamie Whyte, who has been a witness on the programme, advises readers to listen to The Moral Maze for innumerable examples of faulty reasoning. Journalist and author Nick Cohen has also criticised the programme, in a piece highlighting the media careers of Trotskyite-turned-libertarian former cadres of the Revolutionary Communist Party, centered around the Spiked magazine.

Originally debuting as an antagonist, Gaara is a shinobi affiliated with Sunagakure and is the son of Sunagakure's leader, the Fourth Kazekage. He was born as a demon's host as part of his father's intention to have a weapon to restore their village. However, a combination of being ostracized by the Sunagakure villagers, his early inability to control the Tailed Beast, and the notion that his deceased mother called him her curse on the village caused Gaara to become a ruthless killer who believes his own purpose is to kill his enemies. Only after meeting Naruto Uzumaki does Gaara earn a change of perspective, as he eventually becomes Sunagakure's and gains acceptance by his people. Gaara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including two of the featured films in the series, the third original video animation, and several video games Gaara was created a foil to the series' eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, as the two were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly different personalities due to a troubled upbringing. His designs and name underwent major changes in the making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to give Gaara a design that is easier to draw. In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O'Brien voices him in the English dub. Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Gaara's character. Multiple series called Naruto's fight against Gaara the high point of the entire series due to their similarities and Gaara's role in the aftermath as he attempts to redeem himself. Among the Naruto reader base, Gaara has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls and always making it to the top ten characters. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Gaara's likeness, including plush dolls, key chains, and action figures. Creation and conception Early designs for Gaara when he was known as Kumomaru. Naruto author Masashi Kishimoto created Gaara as a foil to the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto and he have a similar background: he was rejected by his peers and fellow villagers for being the host of One- Tailed beast, Shukaku, a situation that Kishimoto describes as \\"very much like Naruto's\\". Gaara's development from this state into a highly withdrawn, sadistic character was intended to induce sympathy for him from readers, as it was contrasted against Naruto's development into a cheerful troublemaker. Additionally, his design was designed to look like the Tanuki since Kishimoto thought that it would make him a good rival for Naruto's Nine-Tailed Demon Fox since several parts from the Shukaku were considered by Kishimoto to be opposite ones from the Demon Fox. Gaara's backstory became one of Kishimoto's favorite stories from Part I; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters as he wanted readers to understand more of Gaara's mental state. The character was originally going to be called Kotarou Fuuma, but Kishimoto's editor highly refused to give him that name. As a result, he was given the name Gaara why he felt more suitable to the fact he always uses sand. By 2013, Kishimoto stated he still did not understand why such name was discarded. Nevertheless, he refrained from giving him a complete name like Gaara Yuzawa. Another early name was a younger child named \\"Kumomaru\\" but was avoided by Kishimoto. However, after multiple changes, he became Gaara. Due to his importance in the manga as a result of being Naruto's foil, Kishimoto added the kanji for \\"love\\" in his head to complement his name (part of Gaara's name can be read as \\"love\\"). Gaara's initial attire, along with the costumes of his siblings, was difficult for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave the three of them simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there was a scene where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara's body. This shot was inspired by Akira, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of. In the Japanese version of Narutos animated versions Akira Ishida voices Gaara. Liam O'Brien takes his place for the English dub. The Western actor, before being selected to voice Gaara, had already heard about the series' popularity. O'Brien went for an early audition in Los Angeles with hopes of doing Gaara's voice but failed it. However, Brien later went through another audition and got Gaara's role. Appearances =In Naruto= Before he was born, Gaara's father, the Fourth Kazekage Rasa, had Chiyo make Gaara into the Jinchuriki for the tailed beast while he was still in his mother's womb before she died giving birth to him. Though believed at the time to be Shukaku's power in action, Gaara can manipulate sand, which subconsciously protects him. Rasa intended to use Gaara as the village's personal weapon, but Shukaku's bloodlust proved too much for Gaara as he suffered night terrors brought about by the tailed beast's influence. With Gaara's sand adding to his inability to control Shukaku, the boy became feared to the point his father decided to have him assassinated. Gaara has the belief that he could only rely upon himself and Shukaku, after Yashamaru, the only person who he thought loved him tried to kill him, on the order of his father, and that he had to kill others in order to confirm the value of his own existence. He thus became narcissistic, even permanently scarring his left temple with the kanji for for his new drive. Gaara first appears in the series when he is sent to Konohagakure, an allied ninja village, to take part in the Chunin Exams alongside his older siblings Kankuro and Temari. In truth, he is sent in order to infiltrate Konohagakure in preparation for an invasion by Sunagakure and its ally, Otogakure. There, he and Kankuro and Temari easily pass both the first and second phases. In the third phase, Gaara is set to fight against Rock Lee. Lee is able to pass Gaara's defenses, provoking an enraged Gaara into breaking Lee's arm and leg, claiming victory. Sasuke Uchiha manages to give Gaara the first injury he has ever received, causing Gaara to suffer a mental breakdown and nearly manifest his Tailed-Beast powers. This begins the invasion, with his older siblings carrying him off as he could not participate in his current state of mind. Both Sasuke and Naruto Uzumaki confront him with the latter defeating him. Later, Sunagakure sends Gaara to help in preventing Sasuke from defecting to Otogakure, which became enemy of Sunagakure once learning that Orochimaru murdered Rasa prior to the attack. While he is able to help Lee fight Orochimaru's servant Kimimaro, Gaara is unable to prevent Sasuke from escaping from Konoha. He makes amends with the many characters he had alienated, apologizing to those he hurt and improving his relationship with his family. At the same time, Gaara's fundamental characteristic becomes the desire to protect as many people as he can, as in doing so he believes, like Naruto, he will be able to find true strength. This culminates in his replacing his father as the Fifth Kazekage during Part II of the series. In Part II of the series, three years after his mission, Deidara, a member of the criminal organization Akatsuki, is sent to Sunagakure to capture Gaara. Gaara fights Deidara to protect the village, but is defeated. The members of the Akatsuki then kidnap him and extract Shukaku from his body. Gaara dies in the process but an elder from the village named Chiyo sacrifices her own life to revive him. Sometime later, he goes to the Five Kage Summit, where the Akatsuki's leader Tobi, breaks into the meeting and announces the Fourth Great Ninja War to capture the last two Tailed-Beasts. Gaara later joins the new Shinobi Alliance as its field commander to protect Naruto and Killer Bee, using Naruto's philosophy of love and the Akatsuki's philosophy of hatred to unite the army when it nearly imploded from internal conflict. On the second day of the war, Gaara encounters his reanimated father. Rasa reveals the truth to Gaara that his uncle's final action was his doing and that the truth that Gaara's mother always loved him, moving Gaara to tears after learning his mother's will is the force behind his sand. Rasa recognizes his son has surpassed him and entrusts Sunagakure to him after being defeated. Gaara later defeats and seals the revived Second Mizukage and joins the rest of the five Kage to fight the Madara Uchiha who was reanimated by Kabuto, nearly getting killed as a result. Later healed by Tsunade, Gaara departs with the other Kage to site of their side's battle with Tobi. Before watching him be absorbed by the Gedo Statue again, Gaara manages to make his peace with Shukaku while thanking the tailed beast for ensuring that he would meet Naruto. They take him to Minato Namikaze and Gaara holds off Madara before Might Guy takes over prior Naruto being successfully revived. Once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is activated, Gaara is caught in the illusion of being with his entire family and Naruto as his friend before being freed by Naruto and Sasuke. By the series epilogue, having the Hidden Leaf Village's Nara Clan as in-laws through Temari, Gaara remains active as the Kazekage. =In other media= Gaara has made several appearances outside of the Naruto anime and manga. He is present in the second and sixth Naruto feature films, Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel and Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire. In the former, he protects the Land of Wind from an assault by Haido, the antagonist of the film, and later battles the lightning user Ranke, one of Haido's subordinates, and defeats her, while in the latter, he temporarily becomes enemies of Konohagakure as they are the prime suspect of a pitfall attack on him while he is about to attend a meeting with Tsunade, in reality being done by a missing nin, Hiruko, and briefly battles Naruto, although after the confusion is cleared, he allies himself with them again. Gaara is also present in the third original video animation released in the series, in which he participates in a tournament of various characters from across the series. In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Gaara has adopted a child named Shinki. Gaara and the other Kage attend the Chunin exam in Konoha before they engage in combat against Momoshiki and Kinshiki in a rescue mission led by Sasuke after Naruto was kidnapped. This role is retitled in the Naruto manga sequel, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. Naruto video games commonly feature Gaara, including the Clash of Ninja and Ultimate Ninja series. In some games, he uses his Shukaku form for combat, as well as other moves not seen in the anime or manga. Naruto Shippūden: Gekitou Ninja Taisen EX marks the first appearance of Gaara in his Part II appearance in a video game. Gaara also appears in light novels from the series. He makes a cameo in Kakashi's Story alongside the other Kage. In Shikamaru Hiden he joins his sister Temari and Naruto in the search for the missing Shikamaru Nara whom Gaara values due to his close relationship with Temari. In Sakura's Hiden, Gaara assists the Konohagakure ninja upon their news that a man resembling Sasuke Uchiha is planning to attack the village. In Konoha Hiden, Gaara visits Konohagakure to see the wedding of Naruto and Hinata Hyuga. He also appears as the protagonist of Gaara Hiden which follows his works as the Fifth Kazekage while dealing with his sister's wedding with Shikamaru. Reception Liam O'Brien has received praise for voicing Gaara in English. Gaara has ranked highly in the popularity polls for the series, continuously placing in the top ten. The last such poll was in 2011, in which Gaara was in 4th place. Several pieces of Gaara merchandise have been released; including key chains, plush dolls and action figures of his Part I and Part II appearance. AnimeCentral listed him as eighth best villain in anime with comments focused on how flashbacks made him a tragic character and at the same time similar to Naruto Uzumaki. Additionally, his fight against Rock Lee was listed as the second best one in anime for exchanges in moves and its conclusion. In 2014, IGN listed him as the third best Naruto character when the series ended. Anime and manga publications have mostly praised Gaara's character. IGN noted that Gaara was an \\"anti-Naruto\\", possessing a \\"dark, solemn character\\" as opposed to Naruto's continuous cheer and excitement. In another review, IGN also called Gaara's background \\"emotional\\" and \\"a tad creepy\\" due to the disparity between the development of Naruto's and Gaara's personalities. Anime News Network celebrated the \\"depth and emotion\\" that Naruto's and Gaara's similarities added to the plot, and commented that \\"nowhere in the entire series run does Naruto shine brighter than in the peak period of his battle against Gaara\\". They also complimented Kishimoto's visual presentation of Gaara in the manga, referring to \\"chilling [glimpses] of Gaara's crazed, exposed face\\". Mania Entertainment noted that Gaara and Sasuke's first fight shows how the former has a \\"fragile\\" psyche despite his violent attitude. His backstory was also praised by Mania Entertainment since it includes \\"a ton of legitimate emotion\\" allowing viewers from the series to understand more Gaara's personality. DVD Talk writer Todd Douglass Jr. enjoyed the similarities between Gaara and Naruto as well as the former's state after being defeated by the latter. His return to aid the Konohagakure ninjas to fight has been praised by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime who was mostly focused on Gaara's change of hearts. Liam O'Brien, Gaara's voice actor in the English dubbed version of the anime, has been praised. IGN noted that he did an \\"excellent job\\" of making Gaara sound terrifying to the viewer, and Anime News Network noted him as one of the best voice actors in the series. Gaara's promotion to leader from Sunagakure in Part II of the series was deemed as the most surprising development in the series by Briana Lawrence from Mania Entertainment. UK Anime Network's Kevin Leathers stated that while in the first part of the series, Gaara was a fearsome villain, in the following one he became \\"much more three-dimensional.\\" Similarly, Douglass Jr. praised Gaara's development in later episodes from Naruto: Shippuden owing to his relationship's expansion with Naruto. His fight against Deidara has also received positive response, with critics praising the revisit of Gaara's popular moves and the strategy both fighters employed. On the other hand, Jason Thompson from Anime News Network noted that, while Gaara had developed ever since his introduction in Part I, it felt wrong that Gaara was accepted as the new Kazekage due to his previous wishes to kill people. During the last episodes of Part II's adaptation, Amy McNulty, also from Anime News Network, enjoyed how Gaara was handled as a comic relief alongside other recurring character. Nevertheless, she found important how Gaara now thought of Naruto as a friend rather than as a hero in contrast to the early story arcs of Part II.

History  The China Development Bank Tower in Shanghai. The China Development Bank (CDB) was established in March 1994 to provide development- oriented financing for high-priority government projects. It is under the direct jurisdiction of the State Council and the People's Central Government. At present, it has 35 branches across the country and one representative office. The bank provides financing for national projects such as infrastructure development, basic industries, energy, and transportation. The main objective as a state financial institution is to support the macroeconomic policies of the central government and to support national economic development and strategic structural changes in the economy. In the last decade, CDB has issued 1.6 trillion yuan in loans to more than 4,000 projects involving infrastructure, communications, transportation, and basic industries. The investments are spread along the Yellow River, and both south and north of the Yangtze River. CDB has been increasingly focusing on developing the western and northwestern provinces in China. This could help reduce the growing economic disparity in the western provinces, and it has the potential to revitalize the old industrial bases of northeast China. Since 1997, CDB has reduced bad debts, returning to profitability under Governor Chen Yuan, the eldest son of Chen Yun. Chen was formerly the executive deputy governor of the PRC's central bank, The People's Bank of China. International financial standards and better practices were introduced under his leadership. CDB plays a major role in alleviating infrastructure and energy bottlenecks in the Chinese economy. In 2003, CDB made loan arrangements for, or evaluated and underwrote, a total of 460 national debt projects and issued 246.8 billion yuan in loans. This accounted for 41% of its total investment. CDB's loans to the \\"bottleneck\\" investments that the government prioritizes amounted to 91% of its total loan count. It also issued a total of 357.5 billion yuan in loans to western areas and more than 174.2 billion yuan to old industrial bases in Northeast China. These loans substantially increased the economic growth and structural readjustments of the Chinese economy. At the end of 2004, the bank's total credit assets were RMB 1,378.6 billion, with a current principal and interest recovery ratio of 99.77%, after 20 consecutive quarters of world- class performance. The bank's non-performing loan ratio stood at 1.21%, a decrease of 0.13 percentage points year over year. The coverage ratio of its risk reserves against non-performing loans was 285%, and its capital adequacy ratio reached 10.51%. During 2004, the bank made a profit of about US$2 billion. In 2005 and 2006, CDB successfully issued two pilot Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) products in the domestic China market. Along with other ABS products issued by China Construction Bank, CDB has created a foundation for a promising debt capital and structured finance market. At the end of 2010, CDB held US$687.8 billion in loans, more than twice the amount of the World Bank. As of December 2018, outstanding loans to 11 provincial-level regions along the belt amounted to 3.85 trillion yuan (about 575 billion U.S. dollars), according to the CDB. New yuan loans to these regions reached 304.5 billion yuan last year, accounting for 48 percent of the bank's total new yuan loans. The funds mainly went to major projects in the fields of ecological protection and restoration, infrastructure connectivity, and industrial transformation and upgrading. The CDB will continue to support ecological protection and green development of the Yangtze River in 2019, said CDB Chairman Zhao Huan. China issued a development plan for the Yangtze River Economic Belt in September 2016 and a guideline for green development of the belt in 2017. The Yangtze River Economic Belt consists of nine provinces and two municipalities that cover roughly one-fifth of China's land. It has a population of 600 million and generates more than 40 percent of the country's GDP.  Organizational structure  The Governors of the bank report to a Board of Supervisors, who are accountable to the central government. There are four vice governors and two assistant governors.China Development Bank At the end of 2004, CDB had about 3,500 employees. About 1,000 of CDB's employees work at the Beijing Headquarters, with the rest in 35 mainland branches; including a representative office in Tibet and a branch in Hong Kong. The bank does not take private savings, so it does not have local branches like many other major banks. =Subsidiaries= * China Development Bank International Investment  Management  Stuart Gulliver, Executive Director of HSBC signs a \\"Memorandum of Understanding\\" with Zheng Zhijie, Vice Governor of China Development Bank, 10 January 2011. * Chairman Hu Huaibang,China Development Bank Management Team (Chinese) born in September 1955.

The film's title is one of the possible translations of the Arabic word \\"Islam\\". A Muslim terrorist reacted to the film by assassinating Van Gogh. Content Image of a woman's body with Koranic verses written on it from the film Submission. The actress plays the role of a Muslim woman (dressed with a transparent black clothing), having been beaten and raped by a relative. The bodies are used in the film as a canvas for verses from the Quran. The film tells the story of four fictional characters played by a single actress wearing a veil, but clad in a see-through Hijab, her naked body painted with verses from the Quran. The characters are Muslim women who have been abused in various ways. The film contains monologues of these women and dramatically highlights three verses of the Koran ( and ), by showing them painted on women’s bodies. Motivation Writer Hirsi Ali has said \\"it is written in the Koran a woman may be slapped if she is disobedient. This is one of the evils I wish to point out in the film\\". In an answer to a question about whether the film would offend Muslims, Hirsi Ali said that \\"if you're a Muslim woman and you read the Koran, and you read in there that you should be raped if you say 'no' to your husband, that is offensive. And that is insulting.\\" Director of the film, Theo Van Gogh, who was known as a controversial and provocative personality,Lim, Dennis: The Village Voice, 16 November 2004 \\"he was most famous for being a radical-libertarian loudmouth. A political columnist who got fired from almost every newspaper in the country, he delighted in blurring the line between free speech and hatemongering—he insisted on calling conservative Muslims 'goatfuckers.'\\"Review of Submission by Phil Hall \\"In his own career, van Gogh was a minor figure within Dutch culture who was known for writing rude political columns and creating films designed to challenge the sensibilities of Dutch audiences–which was no mean feat, given that nation’s excessively liberal social environment.\\" called the film a \\"political pamphlet.\\"Simons, Marlese. \\"Ex-Muslim turns her lens on a taboo\\", The New York Times \\" 'Of course it's a political pamphlet; that's undeniable,' said Theo van Gogh, who directed the film and insisted.....\\" Reception The film drew praise for portraying the ways in which women are abused in accordance with fundamentalist Islamic law, as well as anger for criticising Islamic canon itself. It drew the following comment from movie critic Phill Hall, \\"Submission was bold in openly questioning misogyny and a culture of violence against women because of Koranic interpretations. The questions raised in the film deserve to be asked: is it divine will to assault or kill women? Is there holiness in holding women at substandard levels, denying them the right to free will and independent thought? And ultimately, how can such a mindframe exist in the 21st century?\\" Film critic Dennis Lim, on the other hand, stated that, \\"It's depressing to think that this morsel of glib effrontery could pass as a serious critique of conservative Islam.\\" Another (unnamed) critic referred to the stories told in the film as \\"simplistic, even caricatures\\". After the film's broadcast on Dutch television, newspaper De Volkskrant reported claims of plagiarism against Hirsi Ali and Van Gogh, made by Internet journalist Francisco van Jole. Van Jole said the duo had \\"aped\\" the ideas of Iranian American video artist Shirin Neshat. Neshat's work, which made abundant use of Persian Calligraphy projected onto bodies, had been shown in the Netherlands in 1997 and 2000. Assassination of Theo van Gogh On 2 November 2004, Van Gogh was assassinated in public by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim with a Dutch passport. A letter,'Jihad Manifesto' - A call to destroy America and all \\"unbelievers\\", English translation - letter left on van Gogh's body by the militant Islamist killer, Militant Islam Monitor.org, 5 November 2004 stabbed through and affixed to the body by a dagger, linked the murder to Van Gogh's film and his views regarding Islam. It was addressed to Ayaan Hirsi Ali and called for a jihad against kafir (unbelievers or infidels), against America, Europe, the Netherlands, and Hirsi Ali herself. Following the murder of Van Gogh, tens of thousands gathered in the center of Amsterdam to mourn Van Gogh's death. Besides Bouyeri, eleven other Muslim men were arrested and charged with conspiracy to assassinate Hirsi Ali.Slaughter And 'Submission' - Creator Of Dutch Film Vows Sequel Despite Muslim Death Threats, CBS, 20 August 2006 Bouyeri was jailed for life, for which in the Netherlands there is no possibility of parole, and pardons are rarely granted. Some of the others were convicted of other offences in relation to their involvement in the so-called Hofstad Network, but not for a direct connection with the Van Gogh murder.

Brunhilda is the German form and the most common in English. In French, she is Brunehaut, in Spanish, Brunegilda or Brunequilda. Other versions of this name include Brunilda, Brunichildis, Brunechildis, Brunichild, Brunechilde, Brunichilda, Brunhild, Brunhilde, Brünnhilde, Brünhild, Brynhild, and Brynhildr. (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2004). (c. 543–613) was queen consort of Austrasia, part of Francia, by marriage to the Merovingian king Sigebert I of Austrasia, and regent for her son, grandson and great grandson. In her long and complicated career she ruled the eastern Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and Burgundy for three periods as regent for her son Childebert II from 575 until 583; her grandson Theudebert II from 595 until 599; and great-grandson Sigebert II in 613. The period was marked by tension between the royal house and the powerful nobles vying for power. Brunhilda was apparently an efficient ruler, but this and her forceful personality brought her into conflict with her nobles, the church, and the other Merovingians. Her bitter feud with Fredegund, mistress of Chilperic I of Neustria, who murdered Brunhilda's sister, Queen Galswintha, c. 568 in order to replace her as queen, lasted until Fredegund's death in 597. Fredegund had Brunhilda's husband murdered and Brunhilda imprisoned for a period. This feud was continued by Fredegund's son, Chlothar II, who in 613 defeated Brunhilda in battle and had her executed by being pulled apart by four horses. Life Brunhilda was possibly born about 543 in the Visigothic capital of Toledo, the younger of the two daughters of Athanagild and Goiswintha. She was only eleven years old when her father was made king in 554. She was educated in Toledo as an Arian Christian. =First marriage= In 567, she was married to King Sigebert I of Austrasia, a grandson of Clovis I, who had sent an embassy to Toledo loaded with gifts. She joined him at Metz. Upon their marriage, she converted to Catholicism.Gregory of Tours, IV.27. Sigebert's father, Chlothar I, had reunited the four kingdoms of the Franks, but when he died, Sigebert and his three brothers divided them again. According to historian and bishop Gregory of Tours, Sigebert's marriage to a Visigothic princess was a criticism of his brothers' choices in wives. Instead of marrying a low-born woman, Sigebert chose a princess of education and morals. In response to Sigebert's noble marriage, his brother, Chilperic I of Neustria, sent for Brunhilda's sister, Galswintha. Gregory of Tours suggests that he proposed because he envied his brother's marriage to Brunhilda;Gregory, IV.28. however, Galswintha ordered him to purge his court of courtesans and mistresses and he soon grew tired of her. He and his favorite mistress, Fredegund, conspired to murder her. An unknown assailant strangled Galswintha while she slept in her bed and Chilperic married Fredegund. Brunhilda so detested Fredegund for the death of her sister--and this hatred was so fiercely reciprocated--that the two queens persuaded their husbands to go to war.Gregory IV.47 Sigebert persuaded their other brother, the elder Guntram of Burgundy, to mediate the dispute between the queens. He decided that Galswintha's dower of Bordeaux, Limoges, Cahors, Béarn, and Bigorre should be turned over to Brunhilda in restitution. However, Chilperic did not easily give up the cities and Brunhilda did not forget the murder. Bishop Germain of Paris negotiated a brief peace between them. Between 567 and 570, Brunhilda bore Sigebert three children: Ingund, Chlodosind, and Childebert. The peace was then broken by Chilperic, who invaded Sigebert's dominions. Sigebert defeated Chilperic, who fled to Tournai. The people of Paris hailed Sigebert as a conqueror when he arrived with Brunhilda and their children. Bishop Germain wrote to Brunhilda, asking her to persuade her husband to restore the peace and to spare his brother. Chroniclers of his life say that she ignored this; certainly Sigebert set out to besiege Tournai. Fredegund responded to this threat to her husband by hiring two assassins, who killed Sigebert at Vitry-en-Artois with poisoned daggers (scramsaxi, according to Gregory). Brunhilda was captured and imprisoned at Rouen. =Second marriage= Merovech, the son of Chilperic and his first wife Audovera, went to Rouen on pretext of visiting his mother. While there, he decided to marry the widowed Brunhilda and thus strengthen his chances of becoming a king. His stepmother, Fredegund, was determined that only her sons should succeed as kings and eliminated her husband's sons by other women. Merovech and Brunhilda were married by the Bishop of Rouen, Praetextatus. However, since Brunhilda was Merovech's aunt the marriage was contrary to canon law.Gregory V.2 Chilperic soon besieged them in the church of St Martin on the walls. Eventually he made peace with them, but he took Merovech away with him to Soissons. In an effort to nullify the marriage, Chilperic had Merovech tonsured and sent to the monastery of Le Mans to become a priest. Merovech fled to the sanctuary of St Martin at Tours, which was Gregory's church (who was thus an eyewitness to these events),Gregory V.14 and later to Champagne. He finally returned to Tours in 578 and when his bid for power failed, he asked his servant to kill him.Gregory V.18 =First regency= Brunhilda now tried to seize the regency of Austrasia in the name of her son Childebert II, but she was resisted fiercely by her nobles and had to retire briefly to the court of Guntram of Burgundy before obtaining her goal. At that time, she ruled Austrasia as regent. Not being a fighter, she was primarily an administrative reformer, with a Visigothic education. She repaired the old Roman roads, built many churches and abbeys, constructed the necessary fortresses, reorganised the royal finances, and restructured the royal army. However, she antagonised the nobles by her continued imposition of royal authority wherever it was lax. To reinforce her positions and the crown's prestige and power, she convinced Guntram, newly heirless, to adopt Childebert as his own son and heir. This he did in 577.Gregory VI.1 In 579, she married her daughter Ingunda, then only thirteen, to the Visigothic prince Hermenegild, allying her house to that of the king of her native land. However, Hermenegild converted to Catholicism and he and his wife both died in the ensuing religious wars which tore apart the Visigothic kingdom in Spain. Brunhilda ruled Austrasia until Childebert came of age in 583, at the traditional Merovingian majority of thirteen. =Relations with King Guntram= The conflict with Fredegund flared up once more upon the death of Chilperic. Now in the regency in Neustria, Fredegund was in a position to renew the war with her old enemy. Simultaneously, Brunhilda had to deal with her own internal enemies. Many of the dukes strongly opposed her influence over her son Childebert, the king. Three of them--Rauching, Ursio, and Berthefrid--conspired to assassinate Childebert; however, their plot was found out. Rauching was killed and Ursio and Berthefrid fled to a fortress. Upon this, Guntram immediately begged for Childebert, Brunhilda, and Childebert's two sons to take refuge at his court. This they did and soon Ursio and Berthefrid were killed. In 587, Guntram, Childebert, and Brunhilda settled the Pact of AndelotGregory IX.20 securing for Childebert the Burgundian succession and a continuing alliance of the two realms of Austrasia and Burgundy for the rest of Guntram's life. In that same year, King Reccared I of the Visigoths sent embassies to both Childebert and Guntram, the former accepting them and consolidating an alliance and the latter refusing to see them. Thus, when Brunhilda and Childebert negotiated a marriage for the king's sister Chlodosind with the king of Spain, it was rejected by Guntram and abandoned. In 592, Guntram died and Childebert, per the treaty, succeeded to his kingdom, immediately making war on Clotaire II of Neustria, Chilperic's son by Fredegund. Childebert died in 596 at the age of twenty-six. =Second regency= Upon Childebert's death, Brunhilda attempted to govern Austrasia and Burgundy in the name of her grandsons Theudebert II and Theuderic II. Theudebert became king of Austrasia, and Theuderic, king of Burgundy. Though she attributed the death of Childebert to Fredegund, the latter died in 597 and the direct conflict between her and Brunhilda ended. Peace would elude the Franks, however, for many years more as the conflict raged between the two queens' descendants. In 599, Brunhilda's elder grandson, Theudebert, at whose court she was staying, exiled her. She was found wandering near Arcis in Champagne by a peasant, who brought her to Theuderic. The peasant was rewarded with the bishopric of Auxerre, as the legend goes. Theuderic welcomed her and readily fell under her influence, which was now inclined to vengeance against Theudebert. Soon the brothers were at war. It is at this point that Brunhilda, now in her later fifties and having survived all the previous tribulations, began to display that ruthlessness which led to her especially violent demise. Brunhilda first took Protadius as lover and, desiring to promote him to high office, conspired to have Berthoald, the mayor of the palace, killed. In 604, she convinced Theuderic to send Berthoald to inspect the royal villae along the Seine. Clotaire, in accordance with Brunhilda's bidding, sent his own mayor Landric (a former paramour of Fredegund) to meet Berthoald, who had only a small contingent of men with him. Realising that he had been the victim of courtly plotting, Berthoald, in the ensuing confrontation, overchased the enemy until he was surrounded and killed. Protadius was promptly put in his place. Brunhilda and Protadius soon persuaded Theuderic to return to war with Theudebert, but the mayor was murdered by his warriors, who did not wish to fight to assuage the ego of the queen. The man who ordered Protadius' execution, Duke Uncelen, was soon arrested by Brunhilda and tortured and executed. He was not the first ducal victim of the queen's vengeance. It was also during these later regencies that Desiderius, Bishop of Vienne (later Saint Didier), publicly accused her of incest and cruelty. Desiderius finally enraged her with a pointed sermon on chastity preached in 612 before her and Theuderic, with whom she then hired three assassins to murder the bishop at the village now-called Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne. The murder of Brunhilda, from De Casibus Virorum Illustrium, attributed to Maître François, Paris, c. 1475 =Third regency= The successor of Theuderic II was his bastard son Sigebert, a child. The mayor of the palace of Austrasia, Warnachar, fearing that at his young age he would fall under the influence of his great- grandmother, brought him before a national assembly, where he was proclaimed king by the nobles, who then did homage to him ruling over both his father's kingdoms. Nonetheless, he could not be kept out of the influence of Brunhilda. Thus, for the last time in a long life (now in her seventies), she was regent of the Franks, this time for her own great-grandson. But Warnachar and Rado, mayor of the palace of Burgundy, along with Pepin of Landen and Arnulf of Metz, resentful of her regency, abandoned the cause of Brunhilda over the young king and joined with her old antagonist Clotaire II, promising not to rise in defence of the queen-regent and recognising Clotaire as rightful regent and guardian of Sigebert. Brunhilda, with Sigebert, met Clotaire's army on the Aisne, but the dukes yet again betrayed her: the Patrician Aletheus, Duke Rocco, and Duke Sigvald deserted her and she and her king had to flee. They fled as far as the city of Orbe (in today French Switzerland), hoping to enlist the aid of certain German tribes, but Clotaire's minions caught up with them by Lake Neuchâtel. The young king and his brother Corbo were both killed: thus ended the long and bloody feud between Austrasia and Neustria, and, reuniting the two kingdoms, Clotaire held the entire realm of the Franks. Clotaire then accused Brunhilda of the death of ten kings of the Franks. The identity of the ten kings comes from the Fourth Book of the Chronicle of Fredegar. It is usually said to include Sigebert I, Chilperic I, Theudebert II, Theuderic II, Sigebert II, Merovech (Chilperic's son), Merovech (Theuderic's son), Corbo (Theuderic's son), and Childebert (Theuderic's son) and the sons of Theudebert; along with many churchmen, including Desiderius. According to the Liber Historiae Francorum: > Then the army of the Franks and Burgundians joined into one, all shouted > together that death would be most fitting for the very wicked Brunhilda. > Then King Clotaire ordered that she be lifted onto a camel and led through > the entire army. Then she was tied to the feet of wild horses and torn apart > limb from limb. Finally she died. Her final grave was the fire. Her bones > were burnt. One legend has her being dragged by a wild mare down the Roman road La Chaussée Brunehaut at Abbeville. Religion Brunhilda was raised as an Arian Christian, but upon her marriage to Sigebert, converted to Chalcedonian Christianity. In general, she protected the church and treated Pope Gregory the Great with great respect. He wrote a series of positive letters to her; in 597 he wrote to her about interdicting pagan rites such as tree worship. Gregory of Tours was another favoured cleric; he was a trusted courtier to her and her son from 587 until his death. She also took a keen personal interest in the bishoprics and monasteries within her dominion. This brought her into conflict with Columbanus, abbot of Luxeuil, whom she eventually exiled to Italy, where he founded Bobbio. Brunhilda also played a role in perpetuating the diocese of Maurienne as a suffragan bishopric of the archdiocese of Vienne. In 576, Brunhilda's protector, Sigebert's brother Guntram, had founded the new bishopric at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, separating the Maurienne Valley and the neighboring Susa Valley from the Diocese of Turin. The Bishop of Turin protested this to Brunhilda for more than twenty years, but even when Pope Gregory the Great supported his complaint in 599, Brunhilda dismissed it. Brunhilda was buried in the Abbaye de St. Martin at Autun that she founded in 602 on the spot where the bishop of Tours had cut down a beech-tree that served as an object of pagan worship. The abbey was destroyed in 1793 and two parts of the cover of Brunhilda's sarcophagus are now in the Musée Rolin in Autun.Autun, AVGVSTODVNVM, Capitale des Éduens, ed. by Matthieu Pinette, Autun 1985, p. 380. Brunhilda commissioned the building of several churches and the abbey of St. Vincent at Laon (founded in 580). She is also credited with founding the castle of Bruniquel and having a Roman road resurfaced near Alligny-en-Morvan (where the name of a nearby hill Terreau Bruneau is believed to be derived from hers). The part of Mauves-sur-Loire known as la Fontaine Bruneau is named after Brunhilda who may have cooled herself with the fountain's water when she suffered heat exhaustion. In legend Many scholars have seen Brunhilda as inspiration for both Brunhild and Kriemhild, two rival characters from the Nibelungenlied. Kriemhild married Siegfried, who in many respects resembles Sigebert, Brunhilda's husband. There is resemblance between a multitude of characters and events in the Nibelungenlied and those of the latter half of the sixth century in Merovingian Gaul.

The team plays in the Pacific League and is under ownership by the Orix Group, a leading diversified financial services company based in Tokyo. The combined team began to play in 2005. The Buffaloes split home games between Kobe Sports Park Baseball Stadium, the former home of the BlueWave, and the Osaka Dome, which was the home of the original Buffaloes franchise. Franchise history =Hankyu/Orix (1936–2004)= Hankyu Braves The Orix BlueWave was founded in 1936 under the ownership of a Japanese railway company , as . Later nicknamed the Hankyu Braves, it was one of the first professional baseball teams in Japan. In the early 1950s, the franchise made a dedicated effort to attract foreign talent, particularly African-American veterans of Negro League baseball,Zurui, \\"Negro Leaguers in Japan,\\" BlackTokyo (September 12, 2008). including infielders John Britton and Larry Raines, and pitchers Jimmy Newberry and Rufus Gaines. These players were the first Americans other than Wally Yonamine to play Nippon Professional Baseball after World War II. Starting in the mid-1960s, the Braves became one of the dominant teams not only in the Pacific League but in all of Japanese professional baseball. Between 1967 and 1972, the Hankyu Braves won the Pacific League pennant five times but lost the Japan Series each time against the Yomiuri Giants. Manager Yukio Nishimoto was known as \\"the great manager in tragedy\\" because of those losses. But the Hankyu Braves won Japan Series three times in a row from 1975, against the Tokyo Giants in 1976 and 1977, led by manager Toshiharu Ueda. At that time, many good players in Japanese baseball history played for the Hankyu Braves, including pitcher Hisashi Yamada and outfielder Yutaka Fukumoto. In the 1980s, the team still went strong but lost the pennant to the Seibu Lions every year except 1984. On October 19, 1988, Hankyu Railway sold the franchise to the lease company Orient Lease (since 1989 known as Orix Group), in what was known as \\"the longest day of the Pacific League\\". The reason is that when the franchise sale occurred, the Kintetsu Buffaloes played the legendary \\"10.19\\" double-header for the Pacific League pennant, only to miss the pennant out because of a tie game. The sale was a surprise, at that time, it was much rarer for a Japanese professional baseball team to change owners, not to mention for a large company to sell one of its parts. In that case, Hankyu Railway was thought of as one of the big companies that would never need to do such a thing. The sale was not without two assurances: the team name would remain \\"Braves,\\" and the franchise would stay in Nishinomiya. During the first two years of new ownership, the team was known as the Orix Braves and played in Nishinomiya. BlueWave In 1991, the team moved to Kobe and became the Orix BlueWave. Longtime fans were shocked by these changes. However, since Nishinomiya and Kobe are close to one another, and the new home field of the team was better than the old one, most fans accepted the move, although with some nostalgia for the historic \\"Braves\\" name. The team was sometimes called by fans and the baseball media, which means \\"blue wave\\" in Japanese. Led by Ichiro Suzuki in 1995 and 1996, the Orix BlueWave won the Pacific League pennant. In 1996, they also won the Japan Series. =Orix Buffaloes (2005 to present)= Following the 2004 Nippon Professional Baseball realignment, the BlueWave merged with the Kintetsu Buffaloes. The team struggled since its merger, only finishing in the top half (or A Class) of the Pacific league once from 2005 to 2013. In 2008, The Buffaloes finished 2nd in the Pacific League, going 75-68-1 and finishing 2 1/2 games behind the Saitama Seibu Lions, but were swept by the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters at home in the 1st stage of the Climax Series.

This was very successful, but was overwhelmed by the huge volume of coal exported through Cardiff. At the same time it was seen that railway companies, especially the Taff Vale Railway (TVR), were making money conveying the coal to the docks. The Bute Docks company decided to built a railway from Pontypridd to their dock; they obtained Parliamentary authority for part of the route in 1898, and changed the company name to the Cardiff Railway. To be successful, they needed to make a junction with their main rival, the TVR, at Treforest. A single mineral train traversed the junction in 1909 but legal challenges prevented any further use. The Cardiff Railway had built an expensive railway line that failed to connect with the collieries beyond Pontypridd. The company became part of the Great Western Railway (as did the TVR) in 1923. A low-key passenger service was operated, and a colliery at Nantgarw was served until 1952. The passenger service was cut back to Coryton in 1931 and continues to operate today. Bute Docks System map of the Cardiff Railway in 1911Already in the eighteenth century, it was obvious that some improved means was needed to convey coal mined in the South Wales Valleys to wharves on the Bristol Channel. For many of the pits, Cardiff was the nearest and most convenient location, and in 1790 the Glamorganshire Canal opened from Navigation House (Abercynon) to Cardiff.Charles Hadfield, The Canals of South Wales and the Border, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, second edition 1957, This represented huge progress, but the canal had 49 locks and did not directly reach the majority of the mineral sites. As iron smelting developed on an industrial scale, the demands of that industry too soon outstripped the transport facilities available. The first large dock opened in Cardiff on 9 October 1839; it was named the Bute Dock after Lord Bute who was the principal owner. From 8 October 1840 the Taff Vale Railway opened, in stages, from Merthyr to the Bute Dock, later connecting in pits in the Rhondda and elsewhere. The Rhymney Railway too opened its line from the upper part of the valleys, also reaching the Bute Dock.Eric R Mountford, The Cardiff Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1987, D S M Barrie, The Taff Vale Railway, Oakwood Press, Tisbury, second edition 1950 reprinted 1982 In 1850 the South Wales Railway opened part of its main line; instead of bringing down minerals from the upper part of the valleys, the South Wales Railway was a trunk line, conceived to connect London (through the developing network of the Great Western Railway) with Milford Haven, and from there to generate a transatlantic shipping connection. The South Wales Railway also required a dock connection in Cardiff, for minerals it brought there from along its own line, and this demand put yet further strain on the Docks. A second dock was built, and as the Bute East Dock, it opened on 20 July 1855; the original Bute Dock was renamed the Bute West Dock.D S M Barrie, revised Peter Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1994, From these years there was continual feuding between the Taff Vale Railway and the Rhymney Railway.R W Kidner, The Rhymney Railway, The Oakwood Press, Headington, 1995, Finally on 7 October 1871 the London and North Western Railway secured access to the docks by virtue of running powers over the Rhymney Railway. Other docks The Bute docks in Cardiff were not the only docks available. From the outset Newport Docks had been a serious rival.John Hutton, The Newport Docks and Railway Company, Silver Link Publishing Limited, Kettering, 2002, Further west, the small harbour at Porthcawl, and the Port Talbot docks were important alternatives, although Porthcawl never developed much. Swansea too, after a late start, became the home of an important dock operation. Nevertheless, the huge expansion of South Wales steam coal overwhelmed the available dock facilities, and this led to corresponding hostility to the Bute Docks Trustees, who were seen with some justification as happy to take excessive charges for the use of the dock without making adequate steps to enhance the capacity, and more importantly, to modernise the mechanical handling facilities in their dock. This feeling led to a long-standing desire to build alternative dock facilities in the Cardiff general area. These included Penarth Dock, developed by the Taff Vale Railway, Roath, also developed by the TVR and reached by the building of a new branch line opened in 1888, and Barry Docks. This last was an extensive dock facility laid out with plenty of space and the latest loading aids, with the benefit of new access railways not constrained by the capacity of the existing railways. The Taff Vale Railway had long been criticised for congestion of its lines leading to the Bute docks. Building a new railway Against this background the Trustees of the Earl of Bute decided that they should build a railway line to get access to the lucrative traffic in coal and other minerals from the Rhondda and the upper part of the Taff Valley and the Cynon Valley. This, they believed, would enhance their income from transport to their docks as well as the operation of the docks as such. In 1885 they purchased the moribund Glamorganshire Canal and the Aberdare Canal, with the intention of converting them both into railway lines. This was not proceeded with at once, but in the 1896 session of Parliament the Trustees submitted a Bill for the purpose. The Taff Vale Railway saw this as an obvious assault on its established near-monopoly in those areas, and sought to counter-attack by proposing yet another dock near Cardiff, on the east bank of the River Ely opposite Penarth, and a Bill was submitted for this work in the 1896 session. Both this and the Bute Bills were rejected, however.Peter Dale, Glamorganshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing Ltd, 2014, In the following session, both Companies tried their proposals once again in Parliament, and this time the Bute Trustees were successful. Their Act of 6 August 1897 authorised a line from a junction with the Rhymney Railway at Heath to the Taff Vale at Pontypridd, with a junction to the Taff Vale Railway at Treforest. The Act authorised the change of name from the Bute Docks to the Cardiff Railway, although the dock operation was to be included in the new company's activity.James Page, Forgotten Railways: South Wales, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1979, The Taff Vale Railway was alarmed at this development, as it could only result in traffic, and income, being diverted from its line to the Cardiff Railway. Having found success, the Cardiff Railway promoted a further Bill in the following session, and was authorised on 12 August 1898 to build a railway from Roath Dock to its newly authorised line, joining the Rhymney Railway near the junction. Also proposed in the Bill was a new line from Heath Junction to the Docks, which would have made the Cardiff Railway independent of other lines at the southern end, but this was rejected by Parliament. The junction at Treforest Ex-Cardiff Railway 0-6-0T No. 684 inside Cardiff East Dock Shed 1950On 30 January 1902 the Board was informed that the construction to Tongwynlais was substantially completed, and at this time the company put details of its proposed junction with the Taff Vale Railway at Treforest to that company for approval. The terrain at the point chosen by the Cardiff Railway for its junction with the Taff Vale was extremely awkward. The Taff Vale Railway run down the west bank of the River Taff and was closely hemmed in by the hills to the west. Immediately to the east was the River Taff and the Glamorganshire Canal, and then the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway, and then more hills. The Taff Vale Railway at this point was quadruple track, with the passenger lines on the east side and goods and mineral tracks on the west side. Immediately north of the proposed point of junction, southbound trains could diverge to the lines of the Barry Railway Company. It was a point of contention that many mineral trains were divided at this location, on the running line, with one portion for Cardiff TVR and one for the Barry line. The Cardiff Railway proposed to join the passenger lines and then make crossovers to the mineral lines—the main object of their railway was of course the mineral traffic. The existing traffic on the TVR was remarkably intensive at this time, and the proposal alarmed the company. They examined the rights of the Cardiff Railway and saw that there were no running powers granted on their own line, nor powers to connect to all four tracks; moreover, they claimed, the alignment proposed by the Cardiff Railway was outside the limits of deviation permitted by the CR Act. The question went to arbitration, and then to litigation, and judgment was eventually given against the Cardiff Railway. The CR now went to Parliament to seek the powers that had not been granted before, and they obtained an Act on 4 August 1906, authorising the junction and crossovers they desired. However the junction was not to be opened until the Cardiff Railway had constructed exchange sidings on their own property short of the TVR main line, so that CR engines need not enter TVR tracks. The space available for the purpose of building the sidings was constrained by the point at which the CR line crossed the River Taff, but the sidings were squeezed in. New proposals for the junction were submitted to the TVR, which again rejected them. The design was said to be dangerous; the location was very busy: 294 trains passed the location in 24 hours, and in addition the Barry section of many trains was separated there; long mineral trains were divided on the running line. The Barry Railway also objected, fearing interference with their own traffic. The exchange sidings were said to be insufficiently long to hold full length trains; the space available was clearly not long enough, unless the sidings were extended over the Taff, which would require a series of bridges for them. There was now a dispute about how long a standard wagon was, and whether new Railway Clearing House recommendations for wagon sizes had been allowed for. Once again the matter went to arbitration, held by J C Inglis of the Great Western Railway, and at length Inglis found in favour of the CR in May 1908; it was now six years after the issue was first raised. At this time the TVR offered to purchase the Cardiff Railway. With the CR docks operation, this would have been highly advantageous to the TVR, enabling them to take control of the transport of minerals to the docks and loading there. At the same time the Cardiff Railway was now in financial difficulty, having expended a major outlay on the railway and having gained no income from it. Terms were agreed, and the matter went to Parliament in the 1909 session, but Parliament rejected the proposal on the grounds of the reduction in competition that would be caused. The Barry Railway and the Alexandra (Newport and South Wales) Docks and Railway Company had opposed it, as well as the TVR. Meanwhile, having obtained Inglis's adjudication in their favour, the CR laid in a temporary junction at Treforest. On 15 May 1909 a revenue-earning coal train from the Bute Colliery at Treherbert passed from the TVR system on to the Cardiff Railway. A directors' saloon was attached to the train and the Marquis of Bute and directors of the Cardiff Railway travelled in the train; the Marquis travelled on the engine for the actual crossing of the junction. Immediately after this apparent triumph, the Taff Vale Railway demanded that the temporary junction be removed, on the grounds that it was unauthorised and in a location not permitted by Parliament. (In addition it seems likely that Board of Trade approval for the configuration and working of the junction had not been obtained; as it lay in the TVR passenger line this was a requirement.) Construction 0-6-2T, No. 155 at Cardiff East Dock Depot 1950The line had been expensive to construct; the Railway Magazine described the structure on the line: > The construction of the Cardiff Railway has involved a number of heavy > engineering works. There are nine skew bridges, five crossing the Merthyr > river, three across the Glamorganshire Canal, and one across the River Taff. > Near Nantgawr the River Taff has been diverted. The various cuttings and > embankments are mostly of an extensive character. Ten retaining walls, 12 > under bridges, 10 over bridges, a short tunnel and a viaduct contributed to > the difficult nature of the work. The engineers were Sir Douglas Fox and Mr. > H. White, Mr. Herbert E. Allen, M.I.C.E., being resident engineer. Impasse The Cardiff Railway were now unable to operate across the junction, and indeed never did so again. Having had no income from the line, they decided now to operate a passenger and local goods service on the part of the line up to the junction but short of it. The line was inspected by Colonel Druitt of the Board of Trade on 18 October 1910, for passenger operation from Heath Junction (with the Rhymney Railway) to \\"the termination in a field at Treforest\\". However the stations were not ready and rolling stock had not even been ordered, and Druitt declined approval. A second inspection took place on 30 January 1911. This time approval was given. Most of the halts were merely small cleared areas of ground at ground level, and authority was given for operation by single railcars only. At this time many railway companies had been experimenting with railmotors, generally single coaches with an integrated small steam locomotive. The idea was to enable passenger operation from very low-cost stopping places. In most cases they had retractable steps so that passengers could join and alight at ground level. This was the Cardiff Railway's intended passenger operation; in fact at first only Heath had a conventional elevated passenger platform. The first steam railmotor was delivered from the Gloucester Carriage and Wagon Company on 23 February 1911, and a trailer vehicle a few days later. A public passenger service was started on 1 March 1911. There were eleven trips each way on weekdays, and five on Sundays. A second railmotor was delivered during March, and during occasional non-availability of the vehicles, a conventional engine was hired in from the Great Western Railway to cover the service. The locomotive sections were subcontracted to Sissons of Gloucester; the passenger sections had first and third class accommodation. An editorial in the Railway Magazine was enthusiastic: > On February 27th the first passenger trip was run on the new railway in one > of the handsome rail motor cars which have been built for the Company… The > train was started on the Cardiff Railway by the Marquis of Bute, who for a > short time took up the position of driver.

A \\"Portobello\\" station was proposed, between Tongwynlais and Glan-y-llyn, but this was not built. Birchgrove was built in GWR days. A station called Treforest, as close as possible to the TVR main line, was contemplated, but probably not actually built and certainly never opened; there would have been difficult pedestrian access problems. The line was double track throughout and all the stations had \\"platforms\\" on both tracks. There were goods sheds at Whitchurch and Glan-y-llyn, and the goods and mineral traffic was also available to operate from 1 March 1911, but there was very little demand for some considerable time. There was a colliery at Nantgarw on the line, but it too was very slow to pick up, only being commercially productive from 1920. In 1912 the public passenger service was reduced as an economy measure. Grouping After World War I the Government decided that most of the railways of Great Britain would be compulsorily restructured into one or other of four new large companies, the \\"groups\\". The relevant legislation was the Railways Act 1921. The so-called \\"Western Group\\" was eventually named the Great Western Railway, and the old GWR was naturally the dominant part of the new company. Nevertheless, because of the important dock activity, the Cardiff Railway was considered a constituent (not merely a \\"subsidiary\\") of the new GWR. The Cardiff Railway reported £5.95 million of issued capital, and an income in the year 1921 of £193,973. It had distributed a dividend of 1% on ordinary stock in 1921. It handed over to the GWR 36 locomotives, mostly dock shunters, and 8 passenger vehciels and 43 freight wagons. There were 2,702 employees, reflecting the size of the dock activity rather than the railway.Peter Semmens, A History of the Great Western Railway: I: Consolidation 1923 - 1929, George Allen and Unwin London, 1985, reprinted by Studio Editions, 1990, The new company now had some passenger stations with duplicate names, so that from 1 July 1924 Heath became Heath Halt Low Level; Rhydyfelin became Rhydyfelin Halt Low Level; Whitchurch and Coryton acquired the geographical suffix \\"Glamorganshire\\" (or \\"Glam\\"). The section of line north of Rhydyfelin had been retained in operational condition for political reasons by the CR, but as the GWR now owned the TVR lines as well, there was no point in this, and the section north of Rhydeyfelin was placed out of use from 16 September 1924. The light traffic on the line resulted in a decision to single the line north of Whitchurch, and this was done from 16 May 1928. The passenger business continued to decline due to bus competition, and it was reported that the takings from the passenger business at station north of Coryton were £30 a week in 1930. The line north of Coryton was therefore closed to passenger traffic on 20 July 1931. British Railways In 1948 the main line railways of Great Britain were taken into national ownership, under British Railways. The Nantgarw colliery was buoyant at this time, and the access to it from Coryton was causing operational difficulties, as the signalling had been substantially reduced there. A new connection was installed from the former TVR main line at Taffs Well, crossing the River Taff and joining the extremity of the CR line, giving a new access to the Nantgarw mine, and enabling complete closure of the CR line north of Coryton. This was commissioned on 16 June 1952. The colliery came under threat of closure due to geological exhaustion in 1986 and the spur line was closed in 1990. The present day The line continued an uneventful existence operating passenger trains to Cardiff. It has developed into a useful commuter line into Cardiff from Coryton; in 2018 trains run typically at 30-minute intervals; the journey time from Coryton to Cardiff Queen Street is 14 minutes with five intermediate stops.

Hinata is a kunoichi and the former heiress of the Hyūga clan from the fictional village of Konohagakure. She is also a member of Team 8, which consists of herself, Kiba Inuzuka with his ninja dog — Akamaru, Shino Aburame, and team leader Kurenai Yuhi. At the start of the series, Hinata has strong admiration toward the main protagonist — Naruto Uzumaki, which eventually turns into love as the story progresses. Hinata has appeared several times in the series' feature films, most notably The Last: Naruto the Movie (2014), which revolves around her relationship with Naruto. She has also been present in other media related to the franchise, including video games, original video animations, and the manga and anime sequel Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016), in which she has become the mother of Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki, and is now named . Kishimoto had originally created Hinata as person who would not fight across the story, but in the end he chose to portray her as a kunoichi. In the making of the series, Kishimoto had decided Hinata would marry Naruto; however, the plot regarding their romance was conceived by screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka. Hinata's design has been modified by Kishimoto throughout the franchise's story in order to fit the character's growth. She is voiced by Nana Mizuki in the original animated series and Stephanie Sheh in the English adaptations. Critical reception to the character has been mostly positive due to her actions in the series and her bigger role in The Last — her interactions with Naruto and her engagement in a conflict with the film's villain have been praised. Hinata has also been popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in some polls. Merchandise based on Hinata have been released, including action figures, key chains and figurines. Creation and conception alt=An image depicting a fictional teenage girl In creating Hinata Hyuga, Masashi Kishimoto originally designed a sketch which was shown to one of his assistants. In this sketch, Hinata was not a ninja and instead wore a fashion dress. Kishimoto remarked he had created this design for fun, emphasizing that he wanted Hinata to have a different personality. Nonetheless, the final design changed drastically, with Hinata becoming a ninja and a modern girl at the same time. In 2017, Kishimoto said in an interview that he had decided on Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata getting married from the early stages of the manga. He felt that their relationship was meant to be as Hinata had been supportive of Naruto since the beginning, even before Iruka Umino; however, this angered his wife, who wanted Naruto to end up with Sakura Haruno instead. As the character's popularity was increasing, Kishimoto decided that Hinata would have a bigger role in the final arc. As a result, he conceived the idea of killing Hinata's cousin, Neji Hyuga, in order for her to offer support to Naruto while being protected by Neji before his death. Animator Chengxi Huang behind multiple Naruto series took a liking to this couple ever since he started working in Naruto Shippuden, often aiming to draw scenes of the two and most notably a scene from the final arc when Hinata slaps Naruto to calm him following the death of Neji Hyuga. In the making of the film, he thanked Kishimoto for accepting to do The Last where the couple was explored furthermore. He later created a video which showed a nude Hinata and Naruto in bed together, posted to his work Instagram, but removed it after the video received fan backlash for being inappropriate for the demographic. In the film The Last: Naruto the Movie (2014), Hinata knits a red scarf for Naruto. This was based on how Kishimoto's wife had actually once done for him, which brought laughs to the staff while developing the film. Screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka said he wanted to depict a love triangle between Naruto, Hinata, and Toneri Otsutsuki in The Last. Hinata's character was also developed in the film, with Kyozuka saying that she had to put aside her feelings for Naruto to accept Toneri's proposal so that she could rescue Hanabi Hyuga, her sister. Kishimoto felt embarrassment when it came to the romance in the film, stating that he was not sure if he would be able to look at the scene depicting Naruto and Hinata's kiss. Nevertheless, he felt a combination of satisfaction and sadness due to the couple's development, stating that he considered them his children. =Design= For the series' Part II, Hinata was designed to look like a woman who is beautiful but avoids using make-up and is more focused on fighting. Hinata's appearance was altered when she became a young adult. The clothing she wore varied from girlish clothing to clothing that brought about an adult atmosphere. The character viewed being able to move her feet as important, so she wore clothes with low heels. To make her more like an adult woman, Kishimoto designed her with a strong image in mind. However, drawing Hinata with a pretty and feminine face was difficult, so he largely left the task to Tetsuya Nishio, who was in charge of aiding the author with the character designs. Also, he conceptualized her with a fixed design behind her waist so that her pouch would not get in the way. Different from always being embarrassed in front of Naruto, Hinata wore a languorous expression, which is characteristic of a woman that is deeply in love. For the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015) and the following projects, Hinata was further redesigned. Kishimoto made her hair shorter since it had become a hindrance for her due to her often interactions with her children. Her clothes were created in order to fit her growth as a housewife while still retaining the fashion Hinata likes. =Voice actresses= Hinata has been voiced by Nana Mizuki in Japanese. Nana Mizuki, Hinata's Japanese voice actress, was surprised by the focus her character received. After seeing Hinata as a young adult, Mizuki commented that she was amazed by how womanly and mature Hinata had become. She expressed similar feelings regarding Hinata's interactions with Naruto's young adult self. The character's attributes such as her personality and her unwillingness to give up regardless of the situation were what made Mizuki like Hinata. Her favorite scene in the film was Naruto's love confession to Hinata. Mizuki was happy for what this meant to her character, but she did not enjoy the moment when Hinata took Toneri's side. Stephanie Sheh, Hinata's English voice actress, originally auditioned for both Hinata and Sakura Haruno. She felt pleasure when she received Hinata's role as she found her relatable due to her self-esteem issues. She stated that she wanted her character to end up with Naruto due to her feelings for him. Appearances =In Naruto= Hinata, the eldest of Hiashi Hyuga's two children, is raised as the heiress to Hyuga clan's main household due to Hiashi being the elder between him and his twin brother, Hizashi, and thereby making Hiashi head of the clan while Hizashi is demoted to the Branch House whose only purpose is to serve the upper branch. Hinata is nearly kidnapped at a young age, though saved by her father; this serves as the catalyst of the Hyuga Affair, which ends with Hizashi willingly taking the place of Hiashi to compensate for the death of the head ninja who tried to kidnap Hinata so that a breach in the treaty between the Hyuga clan's village of Konohagakure and Kumogakure is prevented. Growing up, Hinata is trained by Hiashi, but he begins to have doubts about her ability to lead the clan after seeing her struggles during their sessions. As a result, he apparently disowns her, having her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, as the heiress. Hinata also meets Naruto Uzumaki during her youth, developing an interest in him after he defends her while she is being bullied because of her eyes.The Last: Naruto the Movie Novelization That event and Naruto's refusal to give up against adversity inspire Hinata to become a stronger person. However, Hinata's admiration for Naruto gradually turns into romantic feelings. Hinata is introduced in Part I of the Naruto manga during the Chunin Exams, a series of tests that are meant to upgrade her status as a rookie, along with her teammates — Kiba Inuzuka and Shino Aburame. She reaches the third examination, where she is forced to fight her cousin, Neji Hyuga. Despite her fears, Naruto encourages her to battle him. She is nearly killed in combat, and Naruto decides to avenge her. At the end of Part I, after Naruto leaves to be trained by Jiraiya, Hinata vows to become a stronger person. In Part II, two-and-a-half years after the events of Part I, Hinata has been promoted to Chunin and reunites with Naruto, fainting at seeing him for the first time in years. Hinata and her team aid Team Kakashi on a collaborative mission to find both rogue ninja Sasuke Uchiha and his brother, Itachi Uchiha, though the mission is ultimately a failure. After the Akatsuki terrorist leader, Pain, attacks Konohagakure and overwhelms Naruto in combat, Hinata attempts to save the latter while finally admitting her feelings for him. Though, impaled by Pain as means to force Naruto to see the world from his perspective, Hinata survives and her injuries are healed soon afterward by Sakura Haruno. When the Fourth Great Ninja War begins, Hinata is placed in the same division as Neji, and she joins Naruto in the battle against the Ten- Tails after her cousin sacrifices himself to protect them. She manages to defeat the clone of the Ten-Tails but later gets caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi, imagining a relationship with Naruto before being released. After Naruto is able to defeat and reform Sasuke, Hinata and everyone else are released from the Infinite Tsukuyomi. She later attends Neji's funeral alongside Naruto and the rest of the Konohagakure shinobi. In the following years, Hinata and Naruto marry and have two children, a son named Boruto Uzumaki and a daughter named Himawari Uzumaki. = In The Last: Naruto the Movie = The three most common appearances of Hinata Hyuga as promoted for The Last: Naruto the Movie. While Masashi Kishimoto drew all them, he left Testuya Nishio in charge of adapting the young adult one (left) due to his inexperience with drawing women. The events of The Last: Naruto the Movie take place two years after the Great Ninja War in the series' Part II. At the age of 19, Hinata hopes to give Naruto a red scarf she knitted herself as a gift of love. Soon after this, Toneri Otsutsuki infiltrates Konohagakure and kidnaps Hinata's sister, Hanabi, in order to use her as his new eyes. Hinata joins Team Kakashi and Shikamaru Nara on the mission to save her sister. During their journey through the abandoned Shinobi village of the Otsutsuki Clan, Naruto returns Hinata's feelings for him. Despite this, Hinata has been contacted by the spirit of her ancestor, Hamura Otsutsuki, to aid him as the \\"Byakugan Princess\\"; thus, she allows herself to be captured by Toneri on the assumption that they will become husband and wife so that she can destroy the . However, Toneri discovers the deception and brainwashes Hinata after destroying the scarf she originally created for Naruto. Naruto's team finally catches up, and a massive attack on Toneri's palace begins. The team splits, with Naruto disrupting the wedding ceremony just as Toneri was about to kiss Hinata, while the others secure Hanabi. Hinata carries out Hamura's will by helping Naruto destroy the Tenseigan and stop Toneri. In spite of this, Toneri's Tenseigan chakra cloak grants him the power to slice the moon in half, placing Hinata in a giant bird cage. Naruto enters Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, and a huge duel ensues. Near the end, Naruto grasps the last remaining shred of Hinata's scarf and channels his chakra to deliver a punch strong enough to pin Toneri against the wall and depower him, stopping the moon from falling. Hinata takes Hanabi's eyes back from Toneri and returns them to her sister. Soon after, Hinata and Naruto reaffirm their mutual love as they enter into a relationship that leads to their marriage and the start of their family. =In Boruto= In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Hinata tries to make the best of Himawari's birthday by planning a party in Naruto's absence due to his new duties as Hokage. She then watches Boruto while he competes in the Chunin Exams, being approached by Naruto to use her Byakugan to confirm his suspicions that their son is cheating by using a particular ninja tool. After Momoshiki Otsutsuki and Kinshiki Otsutsuki attack and subsequently kidnap Naruto, Hinata tries to rescue him by chasing after them, only to be swept aside and wounded; she is then healed by Sakura. While Hinata is against Boruto joining Sasuke's rescue team, she eventually gives in. With Naruto then rescued, Hinata tends to the damage of Boruto's jacket before he declines.Boruto: Naruto the Movie =In other media= Besides The Last: Naruto the Movie and Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Hinata appears in five other Naruto feature films; in Naruto Shippuden the Movie (2007), she and Shino briefly cross paths with Team 7; in Naruto Shippuden the Movie: Bonds (2008), Hinata, Naruto and Sakura are on a mission to escort Amaru and Shinno to their respective villages, with Hinata incorrectly confirming the death of Amaru and being captured along with the villagers, though later being freed by Amaru; in Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire (2009), she goes in search of Naruto and Sakura who are themselves looking for Kakashi Hatake, and she joins Neji in attacking the flying beast fusion of Ni, Ichi and San, afterward combining their attacks to destroy it; in Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison (2011), Hinata works in a team to bring Naruto back from the Blood Prison; in Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie (2012), taking place prior to the Fourth Great Ninja War, Hinata fights off an attack from the Akatsuki while an alternate version of her, who wears less clothing and has more confidence and assertiveness, appears in the Genjutsu World created by Obito Uchiha, who has used the tailed beasts in his possession. A light novel titled Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze (2015), written by Tomohito Ōsaki and illustrated by Kishimoto, details a date between Hinata and Naruto, the pair trying to save Sakura after her kidnapping by Kido Tsumiki but being too late to rescue her as Sakura has already saved herself. Reception alt=An image depicting a voice actress Hinata is a popular character among Naruto fans, ranking 10th in the first annual character popularity poll, 6th in both the second and third, 12th in the fourth, 9th in the fifth, 13th in the sixth, and 10th in the seventh. Amy McNulty of Anime News Network complimented the voice work of Stephanie Sheh for \\"simultaneously conveying the character's shyness, anxiety and determination\\". Hinata merchandise has been released, including figurines. Reviewing one of the series' early story arcs, Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network said that her fight stimulated her \\"determination to change\\" because of her weak personality. IGNs Charles White enjoyed Hinata's character arc in the first anime series, praising how she fought alone in order to save Naruto from the antagonist Jiga. During the series' final arc, Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post liked the way Hinata supported Naruto and helped him to keep fighting against their enemies alongside her. Critic Yukari Fujimoto stated that Hinata, along with other female characters, prioritized love, treating it as more important than excelling as a ninja. After seeing her in the series' Part II for the first time, Jason Thompson enjoyed Hinata's design and expected that she and Naruto would form a couple in the future. For the finale, Ramsey Isler of IGN stated that while Hinata and Naruto ending up together was not a surprise, it nonetheless disappointed some fans who wanted Naruto to start a relationship with Sakura Haruno. Critical reception to the development of Naruto and Hinata's relationship in The Last was generally positive. Charles Solomon of Los Angeles Times regarded their relation in the film as an \\"awkward romance\\", while Japanator.com wrote that Hinata's struggles with romance were part of the film's favorable aspects. McNulty said that, while the romance might have come off as awkward at first, it became much more appealing to the viewers as the film went on. Brendan Ha of Otaku USA felt that while many readers had known Hinata's feelings for Naruto ever since her early appearances in the series, Naruto's feelings for her had never been seen and thus The Last helped to show them. Ha praised the way Hinata tried to confess her love to Naruto, making the film \\"touching\\". Beveridge found the two characters' development appealing, but he also stated that he wished the film had been condensed in order to focus on the main couple only. UK Anime Network writer Dan Rhodes agreed with Beveridge, saying the main storyline's focus was Hinata and Naruto's relationship rather than the appearance of the film's villain, whom he considered forgettable. Chris Homer, another The Fandom Post writer, felt that Naruto fans had wanted to see this particular pair together for over fifteen years and stated the film \\"delivers\\"; he also praised the relationship between Hinata and Sakura as the latter tried to help Hinata confess her love to Naruto. David West of Neo said that Hinata and Naruto's relationship was well executed, and he praised the inclusion of previous events from the series in which the two characters were together. He also enjoyed Hinata's role in the film and what happened between her and the antagonist. In March 2018, Chinese animator Chengxi Huang posted a video of Naruto and Hinata embracing each other naked in bed, to his public work Instagram. The video received fan backlash for being inappropriate for the demographic. Huang's apology stated that the animation was simply practice, and that he wanted to portray the everyday life of a married couple but still deleted the video in response.

It is named after the British statesman and economist Richard Cobden and had its heyday of political influence in the British Empire during the mid-19th century, amidst and after the endeavour to abolish the Corn Laws. Based on Adam Smith's assertion that full employment and economic growth require access to foreign markets, Cobden perceived the expansion of foreign trade as the main means of increasing global prosperity and emphasized the importance of the international division of labour for economic progress. Akin to his ideal of Britain as an industrial society of small cooperating property owners, he believed in an international order of small, independent nations attaining shared prosperity through international trade. As Cobden saw Britain's involvement in empire as an unwelcome distraction of domestic investment into its industrial capacity, his writings became influential in anti-imperialist circles, being picked up by e.g. John A.

Outside the Naruto anime and manga, Shikamaru has appeared in four of the feature films in the series, as well as several other media relating to the series, including video games and original video animations. Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Shikamaru's character. Many reviewers commented on his laziness and intelligence, and noted his transformation into a leader; Anime News Network celebrated Shikamaru's emergence in the Naruto storyline. Shikamaru has also been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Shikamaru has been released, including action figures, key chains, and patches.  Creation and conception  Masashi Kishimoto originally created Shikamaru in order for him to be the only winner of an early Naruto arc: the Chunnin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However, recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto deciding to interrupt the fighting tournament between the ninjas in order to focus on a recently introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends up becoming the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the series. Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's intelligent but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru if he were a girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair. During Part II, Shikamaru's teacher, Asuma Sarutobi, dies while battling the Akatsuki terrorist member Hidan and Shikamaru briefly starts smoking Asuma's cigars. Kishimoto feared that Shueisha would censore this since Shikamaru was still a teenager and the manga's magazine was aimed at young demographic. However, these scenes were not censored. For the series' finale, Kishimoto introduced Shikamaru and Temari's son, Shikadai, who looks nearly identical to his father. However, Kishimoto aims for both of them to have different characterizations most notably in the manga's sequel, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. Appearances =In Naruto= Shikamaru's first major appearance in the series is during the Chunin Exams; twice a year, Genin take part in them to advance their ranks. He is part of Team 10 alongside Choji Akimichi and Ino Yamanaka. He is a highly unenthusiastic person, and he attempts to go through life with minimum effort. Contrary to his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent; his teacher, Asuma Sarutobi, determined that Shikamaru's IQ was over 200. Shikamaru's abilities are based on the , the signature technique of his clan, with which he merges his shadow with an opponent's shadow, making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru's movements. As the series progresses, Shikamaru becomes able to manipulate his shadow in new ways. By Part II of the series, Shikamaru is capable of utilizing multiple shadow-based techniques at once and can lift his shadow from the ground in order to interact with physical objects; for instance, he can pierce enemies with the shadow tendrils or use them to throw weapons. Shikamaru approaches the exams with a sense of apathy; when he battles the Sunagakure ninja Temari, he defeats her but forfeits his match to her, due to his chakra being low. Despite this loss, he is the only ninja among his peers to be promoted to the rank of Chunin, as the overseers of the exams were impressed by the insight and intelligence he demonstrated against Temari. As a Chunin, Shikamaru is appointed the leader of a team to prevent Sasuke Uchiha from defecting to the village of Otogakure. Although Shikamaru's team manages to defeat the Otogakure ninja barring their way, Sasuke manages to escape. In Part II of the series, Shikamaru is assigned the task of locating two members of the criminal organization Akatsuki. While his team manages to find their targets, the immortal Akatsuki member Hidan kills Asuma Sarutobi during the course of the battle despite Shikamaru's best efforts. After Asuma's funeral, Shikamaru sets out with the surviving members of Team 10 to avenge their mentor with the aid of Kakashi Hatake. As the others deal with Hidan's partner Kakuzu, Shikamaru avenges Asuma by defeating Hidan and making sure the Akatsuki member's body is never found. Following the fight, Shikamaru vows to protect Kurenai Yuhi and Asuma's newborn daughter. He is later assigned to the Fourth Division alongside Temari and Choji. He is named a proxy general under Gaara. In the series epilogue, stating his personal desire during the series of final battles, Shikamaru becomes advisor to the Seventh Hokage Naruto Uzumaki after marrying Temari and gaining a son in Shikadai Nara. = Appearances in other media = Besides the Naruto anime and manga, Shikamaru is featured in seven of the featured films in the series: in the second film, he aids Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno in fighting against Haido, a utopian idealist seeking to rule the world with a power called Gelel; in the fourth, Shikamaru appears in a brief sequence, fighting against a large group of stone soldiers; in the fifth, Shikamaru is sent alongside Kakashi and Sai in search of the base of the Land of Sky, who plans to invade Konoha; in the sixth, Shikamaru, alongside Sakura and Sai, battles the chimera beast summoned by Hiruko; in the eight, Shikamaru participates in the battle against the demon Satori; in the ninth, the Limited Tsukuyomi universe presents a portly Shikamaru, the exact opposite of his teammate, Choji, who becomes the team strategist instead; and in the tenth, Shikamaru leads the team consisting of himself, Naruto, Sakura, Sai, and Hinata Hyuga that is sent to rescue Hinata's younger sister, Hanabi, who was kidnapped by Toneri Otsutsuki. He is also present in the third original video animation, in which he participates in a tournament. Shikamaru is a playable character in nearly all Naruto video games, including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series. In some games, he utilizes variations of his Shadow Imitation Technique not seen in the anime or manga. Naruto Shippūden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! EX 2 marks the first appearance of Shikamaru in his Part II appearance in a video game. A light novel titled Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness, written by Takashi Yano and illustrated by Kishimoto, stars Shikamaru as the main character and narrator. The novel is set two years after the Fourth Ninja War, focusing on Shikamaru's assignment as organizer of the newly formed Shinobi Union to capture a rogue ninja who rules over the distant Land of Silence and attempts to establish a new world order ruled by the common people. It also explores his growing relationship with Temari, culminating in him struggling to name his child with her, years after the end of the novel. An upcoming novel by Mirei Miyamoto will focus on Shikamaru's life as a father.  Reception  Shikamaru has ranked highly in the Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity polls for the series, continuously placing in the top ten and reaching fourth place in one poll. The last such poll was in 2011, in which Shikamaru was in ninth place, behind Sasori and ahead of Hinata. Merchandise based on Shikamaru has also been released, including action figures, key chains, and patches in both his Part I and Part II appearance. NTT customers voted him as their sixteenth favorite black haired male anime character. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Shikamaru as one of his favorite characters from Naruto. Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have commented on Shikamaru's character. IGN stated that Shikamaru was one of their favorite characters in the series, and referred to him as \\"the poster child for any card-carrying member of Generation X\\" due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential. In a review of episode 110, IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair. Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru's emergence as \\"an unlikely hero\\" one of the highlights of the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru's team were critically injured, IGN lauded the \\"great moment\\" in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich celebrated his \\"sheer intellect\\", calling him \\"one of the most fascinating characters in the series\\" and \\"one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen anime\\". Dani Moure, another reviewer from the same site, noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was \\"one of the better fights involving the supporting players\\". Javier Lugo from Manga Life found Shikamaru's fight in the series' fourteenth volume good despite how threatening it is for him. For Part II, Park Cooper from the same site acclaimed Shikamaru's strategy in dealing with the members from the series' antagonist, Akatsuki. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network praised how Shikamaru's epilogue episodes helps to expand his characterization as he decides to aid Naruto when he becomes the Hokage. Reviewing the anime Boruto: Naruto Next Generationss third episode, Sam Stewart from IGN enjoyed the adult Shikamaru's characterization for how he helps his sons Shikadai but ultimately felt he was overshadowed by his wife Temari.

In the anime and manga, Lee is a ninja affiliated with the village of Konohagakure, and is a member of Team Guy, which consists of himself, Neji Hyuga, Tenten, and Might Guy—the team's leader. Unable to use most ninja techniques, Lee dedicates himself to using solely taijutsu, ninja techniques similar to martial arts. Lee dreams of becoming a \\"splendid ninja\\" despite his inabilities. Lee has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including the third and fourth featured films in the series, the third original video animation, and multiple video games. Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Lee's character. IGN compared Lee to Bruce Lee and Noel Gallagher, and Anime News Network called Lee the \\"goofiest looking character\\" in the series. Among the Naruto reader base, Lee has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Lee's likeness, including figurines and plush dolls.  Creation and conception  In an interview in Weekly Shōnen Jumps Naruto Anime Profiles Episodes 1-37, Masashi Kishimoto stated that he enjoys drawing Lee more than any other character in the series. When designing Lee's appearance, Kishimoto intended to have Lee wield a variety of weapons, including nunchaku; however, due to time constraints while creating the series, he was unable to do so. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, originally drew the author a draft of Lee's appearance. While the design highly changed from its draft to the original one when Kishimoto designed it, Yahagi felt pleased because some parts were kept. Kishimoto has noted that he originally designed Lee to symbolize human weakness; Kishimoto's design of Sakura Haruno was also intended to carry the same symbolism. Kishimoto was surprised by Lee's popularity within fans. He intended to write more about him but the timing was never right. Due to the popularity Lee garnered over the course of the series, Kishimoto tends to place him toward the front of promotional artwork in which he appears. In an interview, Brian Donovan, the voice actor for Rock Lee in the English adaptation of the anime, commented that he likes Lee because he felt he was attempting to be a \\"knight in shining armor but bumbling and stumbling at the same time\\".  Appearances  = In Naruto = When he opens the chakra gates, Lee's skin turns red and the power and speed of his taijutsu techniques are enhanced. Rock Lee is a ninja from Konohagakure part of Team Guy, a four-man cell of ninja led by Might Guy. Inspired by Lee's determination to become stronger despite his inability to perform basic ninja techniques, Guy takes a personal interest in him, deciding to help him achieve his dream of becoming a powerful ninja by using only taijutsu that is primary hand-to-hand combat. This relationship with Guy causes Lee to acquire many of Guy's traits. Lee believes he can surpass the natural talents of others through hard work and passion; throughout the series, he attempts to surpass Neji Hyuga, who is labeled a \\"genius\\". Lee first appears in the series as a participant in the Chunin Exams, twice a year exams for ninja who wish to increase their rank. During the Chunin Exams, Lee battles Gaara, a ninja from the village of Sunagakure. In the fight, Lee opens the five of the eight chakra gates, limits on the body's ability to use chakra, using a forbidden technique known as the Hidden Lotus, increasing his natural abilities at the cost of his health. Despite his effort, Gaara cripples Lee by crushing his left arm and leg, injuring Lee to the point that he must abandon being a ninja. When Tsunade, a Konohagakure medical ninja, returns to lead the village as the Fifth Hokage, she offers to operate on him. Despite the procedure's fifty percent chance of failure, Guy encourages Lee to have the operation. Ultimately, Lee undergoes the surgery, which succeeds in healing his arm and leg. Immediately after the operation, Lee follows a team of ninja led by Shikamaru Nara who attempt to stop Sasuke Uchiha from defecting from Konohagakure to the village of Otogakure. Lee battles the Otogakure ninja Kimimaro through using the fighting style in which he becomes inebriated with unpredictable attacks. When Kimimaro is on the verge of defeating Lee, Gaara intervenes, continuing the battle. In Part II, Lee obtains the rank of Chunin, and is dispatched with his team to help save Gaara following his abduction by the criminal organization Akatsuki. During the events of the Fourth Shinobi War Lee is assigned to the Third Division, Lee helps in fighting the Kabuto Yakushi's reanimated army and later aids Naruto Uzumaki in the fight against Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha. Years after the war, Lee marries an unknown woman and has a son named Metal Lee. In the epilogue, Lee is last seen many years later, training with his son. In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Lee hosts the third stage of the Chunin Exam. = In other media = Lee has made several appearances outside of the Naruto anime and manga. In the third featured film in the series, Naruto the Movie 3: The Animal Riot of Crescent Moon Island, Lee acts as a member of Team 7 for the duration of the film. In the fourth film, which is set in Part II, Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, Neji Hyuga, and Lee are assigned to escort the maiden Shion, who needs to perform a ritual to seal a demonic army. Lee also appears in the third original video animation, participating in a tournament. Lee is a playable character in nearly every Naruto video game, including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series. In some games, he utilizes variations of his techniques not seen in the anime or manga. Naruto Shippūden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! EX marks his first appearance in a video game set in Part II. Rock Lee is also the main character of a spin-off manga by Kenji Taira that follows his training in comical misadventures. The manga was adapted into an anime series titled Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals.  Reception  Lee has ranked highly in the Shōnen Jump popularity polls for the series, initially continuously placing in top ten and reaching fifth place once. In later polls, Lee lost his top ten status. Also, several pieces of merchandise based on Lee have also been released, including action figures of his Part I and Part II appearances, plush dolls, and keychains. Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other media have provided commentary on Lee's character. IGN's A.E. Sparrow called Lee one of his favorite characters in the series and compared his personality to that of Bruce Lee and Noel Gallagher. Fellow editor Ramsey Isler ranked him as the eight best character on the series and said he \\"was the true underdog of the series.\\" Isler added, \\"Perhaps a little too intense, but always fiercely devoted to his cause, Rock Lee added all sorts of flavor to the series.\\" However, Rock Lee's profile on IGN describes him as \\"kind of stiff\\" because of his very polite demeanor. Active Anime celebrated Lee's introduction in the series as a comedic relief to the growing tension of the story at that point. Anime Insider listed him in their top five list for \\"pure-hearted heroes\\" from anime and manga publications, ranking at number five. Insider praised him for \\"never [giving] up, even in the face of people with actual ninja powers.\\" Anime News Network referred to Lee as the \\"star of [the Chunin Exam arc]\\", and claimed that he \\"almost single-handedly rescues this arc from being tossed into the 'entertaining but disposable' bin\\". His fight against Gaara in the exams was listed as second best one in anime by AnimeCentral. Anime News Network also called Lee the \\"goofiest looking character\\" in the series and praised Kishimoto's \\"ninja-punk visual sensibilities\\" that allowed him to make Lee \\"damn cool when the action starts\\". In the NEO Awards 2007 from Neo, Rock Lee won in the category \\"Best Anime Character\\". He was also listed as one of the three \\"Honorable Mentions\\" from Naruto by Wizard Entertainment's Danica Davidson with comments from the article being focused on Lee's determination. When the Naruto manga ended, writer Yūto Kubota expressed that Lee was his favorite character.

She is an energy based non-artificial sentient creature called an Aiúa that was placed within the ansible network by which spaceships and planets communicate instantly across galactic distances. She has appeared in the novels Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind, and in a short story \\"Investment Counselor\\". Her 'face', a computer-generated hologram that she uses to talk to Ender, is described as plain and young, and it is illustrated in First Meetings as having a bun. This article is arranged to reflect the Ender timeline. However, the Ender Quartet: Ender's Game (1985), Speaker for the Dead (1986), Xenocide (1990), and Children of the Mind (1994) was written first; then Ender's Shadow (1999), First Meetings (2004), and Shadow of the Giant (2005). Origin =Ender's Game= The Fantasy Game is the faculty's primary method of obtaining information about their students in Ender's Game. It is designed to secretly map out the psyche of the players, providing valuable data on each student's thoughts and decision-making processes. Colonel Graff refers to the game sarcastically as the Mind Game. In the course of its service at the Battle School, the Game successfully analyzes every student but one: Bean, who realizes the game's true purpose and refuses to play. The student chooses a character and plays through a number of scenarios. One scenario, called the Giant's Drink, offers the player a choice between two beverages, with the promise of admission to \\"Fairyland\\" with the correct choice. However, the scenario is actually a no-win situation which invariably results in the player's death. By tracking how frequently a player attempts it, the Giant's Drink detects and warns teachers of suicidal tendencies among the students. To their consternation, Ender confronts the Giant obsessively, failing dozens of times. Finally, he refuses to choose a drink and instead attacks the Giant, killing it and becoming the first student to enter Fairyland; the Game generates this new scenario on the spot, orienting it specifically to Ender himself. This creates a deep connection between him and the Game, with significant consequences later on. =Ender's Shadow= The Fantasy Game is discussed in greater depth in Ender's Shadow. It is described by the teachers themselves as an extremely complex program that generates content procedurally. The Mind Game is never meant to be conclusive, it only makes connections and discovers patterns that are too subtle for the human eye. =Shadow of the Giant= In Shadow of the Giant, when Bean suspects Peter Wiggin of embezzling Ender's trust fund for his Hegemony uses, he recalls the nature of the Fantasy Game and requests that Graff place it in charge of Ender's trust fund. The Game, whose original purpose was to seek out patterns across wide fields of data, is modified to predict markets and invest Ender's trust fund appropriately. Alarmingly effective in this new capacity, it is later called upon to review demographic data and help Bean find seven of his eight stolen embryos/children. The Fantasy Game is assumed to have grown in complexity during the 3000-year gap between Shadow of the Giant and Speaker for the Dead, especially as Graff describes the Mind Game as being able to reprogram itself, and finally becomes the sentient Jane. Appearances =First Meetings= \\"Investment Counselor\\", a short story in First Meetings, describes the first meeting between Jane and Ender where Jane presents herself to Ender as a computerized program meant to help with taxes. Ender takes her up on the offer, and begins a lifelong friendship with this computer entity. =Speaker for the Dead= Jane is first introduced in Speaker for the Dead as an advanced computer program. She is extremely complex, capable of performing trillions of tasks simultaneously, and has millions of levels of attention, even her most unaware one being much more alert than a human. Jane is hesitant to reveal herself to humanity, because she knows that she is the epitome of humanity's fear: an intelligent, thinking, computer program that cannot be controlled. She decided to reveal herself to Ender after she found out he wrote The Hive Queen and The Hegemon, in hopes that he would eventually understand her and one day reveal her true nature to humanity. She also \\"remembered\\" he was the only student to pass the Giant's Drink, one of the many Fantasy Game situations. An electronic \\"jewel\\" in Ender's ear allows both of them to communicate and for her to see and hear everything from Ender's vantage point. She helps Ender with many things. For example, in the very beginning, she contacts an orbiting ship and pays $40 billion for it and the cargo. Ender's reliance on Jane becomes obvious when she no longer helps him; he must ask young Olhado to help him with his finances and computer searches, and does not know the password to his own bank account. Jane plays a pivotal role in the development of the book. Jane guides Ender to Lusitania and helps him out considerably in obtaining information. In a pivotal scene, Ender impatiently disconnects her by turning off the jewel; Jane panics and is forced to reorient her vast amount of concentration which was focused on him. Concluding that Ender needs a common enemy to unite all of Lusitania together to help the piggies, she runs analysis on data and subversively gets Starways Congress to order the destruction of the planet. She makes it appear as if Lusitania has cut off their ansible (she did this mainly to save a xenologer from being killed), triggering Starways Congress to send the \\"Evacuation Fleet,\\" which is actually carrying the Molecular Disruption Device to destroy the planet. With the threat, Ender unites the colony to form a treaty with the piggies to assure mutual cooperation and peaceful coexistence. No longer attached to Ender, she bonds with Miro, Ender's depressed paralyzed stepson. =Xenocide= In this novel, she silences the Lusitania Fleet by making it disappear from all ansibles. Starways Congress contracts the brightest mind on a world of geniuses, Han Fei-Tzu, to discover what happened to the fleet, as previous attempts have failed. He passes the task to his daughter, Han Qing- Jao. Jane has left no evidence, however, and it is precisely this lack of evidence that leads Qing-Jao to conclude that some unseen force is operating and monitoring all the ansibles at once. Although she suspects that it is the work of the gods, Jane realizes that Qing-Jao will eventually discover her existence. Facing defeat, Jane reveals herself to Qing-Jao and her intellectually neglected servant, Si Wang-Mu. After a heated discussion, Qing- Jao despairs because Jane's power is vast; Jane can shut down all the ansibles, making it impossible for Qing-Jao to reveal Jane's presence. However, Jane knows that she cannot continue to silence Qing-Jao's message forever, since it would snowball into cutting off the entire planet of Path. Thus, Jane refuses to silence the ansible, Qing-Jao sends the message, and Starways Congress plans the systematic silencing of all ansibles to kill Jane. In this book it is revealed that the Hive Queens, who were seeking a way to contact Ender during his crusade, attempted to construct a philotic 'bridge' so that they could contact him. This bridge was meant to be a connection between Ender, whose philotic web they did not understand, and a structure whose philotic web they did understand; for this baseline, they chose the Fantasy Game, since Ender was so deeply focused upon it and since its structure was sufficiently orderly. Jane was the bridge they constructed, imbuing her with the quality which all living things have, an aiúa (resembling a soul). Jane, in other words, is an intelligent being, not just a collection of software. The Hive Queen further explains that Jane's aiúa was called from a space outside of the universe, just as all aiúas are. Grego and Olhado, hearing this, hypothesize that, if someone can somehow contain all the information on how a spaceship's philotes are organized (i.e., its structure down to a subatomic level), that person could essentially \\"will\\" the spaceship Outside and In again, instantaneously (that is, without any time passing). This will be entirely dependent on Jane, since no other being possesses the ample mental capacity to hold the complete structure of an object in its mind. Jane's test flight consists of a sealed box with a door, Ender (to whom Jane is inextricably philotically linked; indeed, her aiúa resides within him), Miro (for the same reason), and Ela (so that she can create the recolada virus once they are Outside). While Outside, Ela creates the recolada virus, Miro recreates his healthy body and possesses it, and Ender unconsciously creates duplicates of his childhood brother and sister. =Children of the Mind= In the conclusion of the Ender Saga, Jane finds herself rapidly running out of processing power due to Starways Congress shutting down her active ansible connections one at a time in an attempt to deactivate her for good. The Congress completes the shutdown of all universal ansible connections, forcing Jane's \\"aiúa\\" (the term Jane uses to describe the entity of life which all living things have) to seek refuge amongst the Philotic Web of the Pequenino Mother-Trees. Jane is also simultaneously responsible for instantaneous travel. A simple spacecraft is constructed (later deemed unnecessary due to Jane's precision in transportation), and through holding the image of the traveler in her consciousness, Jane can pick up the image and place it anywhere in the universe instantly. This advancement is threatened by Congress' attempt to deactivate her \\"program.\\" In the end, Jane is given corporeal form in the body created in the form of young Valentine, made of a portion of Ender's aiúa. Jane's aiúa is capable of transcending this corporeal form and returning to the philotic link of the Mother-Trees, or the reconstructed ansible network of which she was born, thus preserving the instantaneous method of travel. Jane, now in the possession of Val's body, marries Miro in a double-wedding ceremony along with Peter and Si-Wang-Mu. Development Card wasn't aware at the time of writing Speaker for the Dead that the computer that Ender interacted with would become a character. Card considers Jane's character pivotal in developing Ender's adult persona and in the process, she became a living thing as well. Her character became a major theme of the Xenocide. After killing the Buggers, Ender is responsible for reconciling the differences between the Piggies and Humans. In the process, Jane's character, as the sole member of her species, also must face reconciling with humanity. Critical reception In a collection of criticism columns, David Langford commented that Jane's character was \\"unnecessary to the main action\\" of the story. In Sarah Kember's Cyberfeminism and Artificial Life, Jane is compared to HAL from A Space Odyssey. Unlike HAL, which Kember described as artificial intelligence, Jane is artificial life and capable of asking critical questions about the nature of her existence.

There, Native Americans boiled the Island's briny spring water to extract salt, which they traded to other tribes as far away as central Texas, Arkansas, and Ohio. According to records maintained prior to 1999 in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Petite Anse Island, renamed Avery Island in the late 19th century, was purchased by John Craig Marsh of New Jersey in 1818. Marsh operated a sugar plantation on the island's fertile soil. His daughter, Sarah Craig Marsh, married Daniel Dudley Avery in 1837, thus uniting the Marsh and Avery families. Daniel Dudley Avery hailed from Baton Rouge, and was a jurist. In 1849, Daniel became co-owner of his in-law's sugar plantation, and in 1855 he became sole owner. Avery Island WildlifeDuring the American Civil War, a mine of pure rock salt was founded on Avery Island in May 1861, which subsequently produced more than 22 million pounds (10,000 metric tons) of salt for the Confederacy. According to the historian John D. Winters in his The Civil War in Louisiana (1963), the rock salt mine had been well-protected, until Union General Nathaniel P. Banks began a push up Bayou Teche. After an all-night march, Union Colonel W.K. Kimball, in Winters' words, \\"advanced to the beautiful little island and, without opposition, burned eighteen buildings, smashed the steam engines and mining equipment, scattered six hundred barrels of salt awaiting shipping, and brought away a ton of gunpowder left behind by [Confederate General] Taylor's men.\\"John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , pp. 231-232 Before the Civil War, Edmund McIlhenny joined the Avery family, by marrying Mary Eliza Avery, daughter of Daniel Dudley Avery and Sarah Marsh Avery. In 1868, McIlhenny founded McIlhenny Company, and began manufacturing Tabasco brand pepper sauce. In 1870, he received letters patent for his sauce processing formula. That same basic process is still used today. In 1938, E.A. McIlhenny established a nutria farm on Avery Island, Louisiana, within shouting distance of the factory where the company that bears his family name makes Tabasco sauce. According to company history, McIlhenny bought his stock of nutrias from a farm in New Orleans, so he was not the first to introduce the creature, a native of southern Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, to North America. That dubious honor belongs to another. What is certain, though, is that McIlhenny, for reasons unknown, released an unknown but probably large number of nutrias into the wild from the confines of Avery Island, and from there they fanned out and proliferated. Avery Island was hit hard in September 2005 by Hurricane Rita.Shevory, Kristina. \\"The Fiery Family: The McIlhennys Make Tabasco Come What May,\\" The New York Times, March 31, 2007, pp. C1 and C4. According to The New York Times, the family spent $5 million on constructing a -high levee, pumps, and back-up generators to ensure that future hurricanes will not disrupt Tabasco sauce production. =Bird sanctuary= Avery Island, Louisiana-015 Under the Avery/McIlhenny family's management, Avery Island has remained a natural paradise, inhabited by many animal species, as well as by exotic plants from throughout the world. Edward Avery McIlhenny, or \\"Mr. Ned\\" as he was affectionately known, founded this bird colony—later called Bird City—around 1895 after plume hunters had slaughtered egrets by the thousands to provide feathers for ladies' hats. Edward gathered eight young egrets, raised them in captivity on the Island, and released them in the fall to migrate across the Gulf of Mexico. The following spring the birds returned to the Island with others of their species, a migration that continues today. =Exotic plants= Edward McIlhenny introduced numerous varieties of azaleas, Japanese camellias, Egyptian papyrus sedge, and other rare plants to the Island's natural landscape. When oil was discovered on the Island in 1942, he ensured that production crews bypassed live oak trees and buried pipelines (or painted them green) to preserve the Island's beauty, wildlife, and utility as a wildlife refuge. Today Jungle Gardens and Bird City are open to the public. Geography Avery Island is surrounded on all sides by bayous (slow-moving, muddy rivers), salt marsh, and swampland; it sits about west of New Orleans. The island was a sugar plantation formerly known as Petite Anse Island. (Petite Anse means \\"Little Cove\\" in Cajun French.) Access to the island is via toll road (technically, a very low toll bridge, which charges only on inbound traffic). At its highest point, the island is above mean sea level. It covers about and is about across at its widest point. =Geology= Avery Island is actually a huge dome of rock salt, long and wide. It was created by the upwelling of ancient evaporite (salt) deposits that exist beneath the Mississippi River Delta region. These upwellings are known as \\"salt domes.\\" Avery Island is one of five salt dome islands that rise above the flat Louisiana Gulf coast. The Five Islands from northwest to southeast are Jefferson Island, Avery Island, Weeks Island, Cote Blanche Island and Belle Isle.

The title was suggested by Leek Van Vlalen's friend, the Sydney University philosopher, Michaelis Michael. Originally released on vinyl as a double album on 26 September 1988, it was re-issued by Shock Records as a lone compact disc. The album reached No. 48 on the ARIA Charts in October 1988. The vinyl version has a different vocal mix on the track, \\"Saturday Night Palsy\\", including an alternate line of lyrics, with the line \\"I want to shoot heroin through the eye\\" replaced by \\"I want to shove a red-hot poker through the eye\\" on the CD.  Reception  The Ages Shaun Carney, in September 1988, described Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance as \\"a fine piece of work. Clever clever they might be on occasions, but if a few more bands applied even half the humor, social observation and melodic intervention that TISM seems to simply toss off, the world would be a, um, groovier place.\\" Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic rated the album as four-and-a-half stars out of five, he explained \\"Completely tasteless and musically mediocre, the album was nonetheless fresh, witty, and extremely funny. The album is more or less standard guitar rock, but it is the song lyrics that make this album great.\\" In December 2004 FasterLouders Kathryn Kernohan felt the group had \\"always written simple, direct pop songs... [their] basic structure has remained the same – danceable guitar and keyboard lines coupled with catchy choruses. The band’s ability to write a ridiculously good pop song is second-to-none and this is no better exemplified than in Great Truckin’ Songs opening tracks.\\" She noticed that \\"The second record of the double-vinyl set (it's not as much fun on CD, is it?) contains various odds and ends, including snippets of a Triple R interview in which the band rode into the studio on lawnmowers.\\" Track listing  Personnel  * Ron Hitler-Barassi (Peter Minack) - lead vocals * Humphrey B.

It was originally released on white vinyl in a clear plastic wrapper with no identifying labels of any kind.  Lyrics  \\"40 Years – Then Death\\" details an early-twenties male's despondent view of his remaining sex life: 40 more years of \\"living\\" then \\"death\\". The single earned TISM recognition as their earlier single \\"Defecate on My Face\\" was very infrequently played on radio, if at all; where this single was quite radio friendly. The snippet after the main song, \\"Art, Religion and the Neo- Classical Dialectic\\", is part of a longer piece, \\"Ezra Pound, Axe-King\\", which has nothing to do with the song from Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance and was released in full on Best Off in 2002.  Track listing  # \\"40 Years – Then Death\\" # \\"Art, Religion and the Neo-Classical Dialectic\\" (unlisted) # \\"The Back Upon Which Jezza Jumped\\" = \\"The Ballad of John Bonham's Coke Roadie\\" = \\"The Ballad of John Bonham's Coke Roadie\\" is a single released by TISM in May 1988. It was released off their debut album, Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance (1988).  Lyrics  \\"The Ballad of John Bonham's Coke Roadie\\" deals with the assistant to Led Zeppelin drummer, John Bonham, whose job was to procure cocaine for the musician. Throughout the song the musician compares his life to that of an ordinary person whose life is racked with misery and spousal unfaithfulness, contrasted with that of the roadie, whose only concern is the acquisition of cocaine.  Track listing  # The Ballad of John Bonham's Coke Roadie # (I Think I've Got) Mick Jagger Worked Out = \\"I'm Interested in Apathy\\" = \\"I'm Interested in Apathy\\" is a single by TISM. It was released in November 1988 from their debut album, Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance (1988). The title is an oxymoron as apathy is literally a \\"lack of interest\\". A 12\\" version, with a bonus track, was issued in December 1988.  Lyrics  \\"I'm Interested in Apathy\\" details the life of a man who has many ideas which range from either life saving, supernatural, answers to conspiracy theories or simply absurd abilities; however, none of these things faze him, nor does he act upon them, because his main focus is apathy. His interest in apathy even prevents him from properly finishing the song, which ends with \\"Well, here we are at the last verse / I've lost interest.\\" Among the things the main claims to know or be able to do are: drilling for oil in the Bass Strait, being able to prove Einstein's theory wrong, predicting mankind's fate and knowing what really happened in regards to Marilyn Monroe's death.  Track listing  # \\"I'm Interested In Apathy\\" # \\"Gas! Gas! – An Ecstasy of Fumbling\\" # \\"The Judeo-Christian Ethic\\" (Only on 12\\") = \\"Saturday Night Palsy\\" = \\"Saturday Night Palsy\\" is a single by TISM. It was released in January 1989 off their debut album, Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance (1988). It was their second single to have a music video. The title is not an amalgam of the film, Saturday Night Fever (1977), and the medical condition, palsy, but it is a reference to radial neuropathy, commonly known as \\"Saturday Night Palsy\\", a condition akin to falling asleep on your arm.  Lyrics  \\"Saturday Night Palsy\\" focuses on a man who has the inability to decide on matters, particularly, in which manner to harm himself. The song continues through with various opposing scenarios offered by the man, but at the end nothing has been resolved. It is one of the more nonsensical songs offered by TISM which surprisingly became a wide hit. The version of this song currently available differs from the recording originally released on vinyl and cassette in 1988. At some point before the song was released as a single, the lead vocal was mostly re-recorded. During this process the second line of the first verse was altered from the original, \\"I want to shoot heroin through the eye\\" to \\"I want to shove a red-hot poker through the eye\\". All subsequent releases of the album (and all CD releases) contained the re-recorded version of the song.  Video  A music video was made by Peter Bain-Hog which featured a handsome man spending his day getting ready to go out dancing. Eventually he finds himself outside of a TISM concert and denied entry, at the end of the video, he is so dejected by the experience that he commits suicide by hanging himself in a nearby alley. The video was intended to parody other similar video clips of the time which showed good looking people dressing up, going out and enjoying themselves, however the final scene was cut from many broadcasts \\"in a superb act of bowdlerisation, thus rendering the clip exactly the same as every other slickly produced clip of groovy models having a good time.\\"\\"TISM – The History of This Is Serious Mum (1989)\\" (2000).

Hey Hey It's Saturday performance  After the single was released, TISM were invited to perform it on the Australian variety TV show, Hey Hey It's Saturday. As the song began, the seven members performing it were joined by seven more and before the song ended, a further fourteen, for a total of 28 so-called band members.  Track listing  # \\"Saturday Night Palsy\\" # \\"Pus\\" = \\"Martin Scorsese Is Really Quite a Jovial Fellow\\" = \\"Martin Scorsese Is Really Quite a Jovial Fellow\\" is a single by TISM issued in June 1989. It was the last single released off their debut album, Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance (1988).  Lyrics  \\"Martin Scorsese Is Really Quite a Jovial Fellow\\" deals with the dark and often depressing nature of Scorsese's subjects and the way that a normally happy or perky person would also be quite depressed after watching one of his films. In the years leading up to the song's development, director, Martin Scorsese, had released Raging Bull (1980) and The King of Comedy (1983). The song also mentions the relationship between the director and the actor, Robert De Niro, frequently cast in Scorsese's films.  Track listing  # \\"Martin Scorsese Is Really Quite a Jovial Fellow\\" # \\"Babies Bite Back\\" Demo tape In 1982, TISM (consisting then of just four members) recorded a tape of demo songs titled Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance.

In particular, the expression is the proper name of the Saoshyant, an eschatological saviour figure who brings about Frashokereti, the final renovation of the world in which evil is finally destroyed. The term was contracted to \\"Soshans\\" in Zoroastrian tradition, and came to apply to three saviour figures that progressively bring about the final renovation. In scripture In the Gathas, the most sacred hymns of Zoroastrianism, believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, the term is used as a common noun to refer to the prophet's own mission and to his community of followers, who \\"bring benefit\\" to humanity. The common noun also appears in the Younger Avesta (e.g. Yasna 61.5), where it generically denotes religious leaders, including Zoroaster (e.g. Yasna 46.3). Another common noun airyaman \\"member of community\\" is an epithet of these saoshyants. In contrast, the standing epithet of the saviour figure(s) is astvat-әrәta \\"embodying righteousness,\\". which has arta/asha \\"Truth\\" as an element of the name.. These saviours are those who follow Ahura Mazda's teaching \\"with acts inspired by asha\\" (Yasna 48.12). \\"Saoshyant\\" first appears as a proper name in the Younger Avesta,. explicitly so in Yasht 13.129 where it is used in the singular and where Astvat-ereta develops into an alternate name of the Saoshyant. The singular also appears in Yasna 59.1 where Verethragna is said to be Saoshyant's weapon in overcoming resistance. A plural form appears for instance in Yasht 17.1 where Ashi--the divinity of \\"recompense\\"--is described to give the Saoshyants the power of \\"making wonderful\\" (frasho.kereti). The term may also be rendered as \\"Renovation\\" and can be translated etymologically as \\"juicy-making\\". The role of the Saoshyant, or Astvat-ereta, as a future saviour of the world is briefly described in Yasht 19.88-96, where it is stated that he will achieve the Frashokereti, that he will make the world perfect and immortal, and evil and Druj will disappear. He is identified as the son of Vîspa.taurwairî and it is stated that he will come forth from Lake Kansaoya/Kansava and will carry the same weapon Verethragna that a number of Iranian epic heroes and kings have used in the past against various demonic foes. Haurvatat, Ameretat, the righteous Dūraoša and other similar entities will be his companions and together, they will vanquish the evil creations of Angra Mainyu. In tradition Already alluded to in scripture (e.g. Yasht 19.88-96, see above), but only properly developed in the 9th-12th century texts, is the role of the Saoshyant during the final renovation. In these Middle Persian texts, the name is contracted to \\"Soshans\\" or similar (\\"Sōshans\\" in living Zoroastrianism). Those medieval works of Zoroastrian tradition envision three future saviours, each of them a Soshans/Saoshyant, with one for the end of each thousand-year period that comprise the last 3,000 years of the world (these three millennia follow the \\"millennium of Zoroaster\\"). According to the tradition (found e.g. in the Jamasp Namag), the first Saoshyant will be named (H)Ushedar, the second (H)Ushedarmah and the third will again be the Saoshyant, who will lead humanity in the final battle against evil. The medieval works also transmit a tradition in which the three future saviours are mythologised as born of maidens, conceived while their mothers bathed in a lake that miraculously preserved the seed of the prophet Zoroaster himself. The story of the Saoshyant's conception and early life are described in Denkard 7.10.15ff as follows: Thirty years before the decisive final battle, a maiden named Eredat- fedhri (\\"Victorious Helper\\") and whose nickname is \\"Body-maker\\" will enter a lake (in Yasht 19.92, this is \\"Lake Kansava\\"). Sitting in the water, the girl, who has \\"not associated with men\\" will receive \\"victorious knowledge.\\" Her son, when born, will not know nourishment from his mother, his body will be sun-like, and the \\"royal glory\\" of the Khvarenah will be with him. Then, for the next 57 years he will subsist on only vegetables (17 years), then only water (30 years) and then for the final 10 years only on \\"spiritual food.\\" The events of the final renovation are described in the Bundahishn (30.1ff): In the final battle with evil, the yazatas Airyaman and Atar will \\"melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and it will be upon the earth like a river\\" (Bundahishn 34.18) but the righteous (i.e. the ashavan) will not be harmed. Eventually, Ahura Mazda will triumph, and his agent Saoshyant will resurrect the dead, whose bodies will be restored to eternal perfection, and whose souls will be cleansed and reunited with God. Time will then end, and asha and immortality will thereafter be everlasting. In the Bahá'í Faith Bahá'í tradition considers the prophecies of the Saoshyant (Bahá'i 'Soshyosh') to have been fulfilled in the person of Bahá'u'lláh, while the other two Soshans of Zoroastrian tradition are interpreted as referring to Muhammad and the Báb respectively.

Many loanwords in Hawaiian Pidgin (or Hawaiian Creole English) derive from the Japanese language. The linguistic influences of the Japanese in Hawaii began with the first immigrants from Japan in 1868 and continues with the large Japanese American population in Hawaii today. Background There are other Japanese words common among the Japanese American population (such as \\"okazu\\" and \\"obaachan\\"), but not as well-known among Hawaii's general population. Such words have not been included here, nor have Japanese words which have entered the English language on a national level, such as \\"anime,\\" (:ja:アニメ) \\"karaoke,\\" (:ja:カラオケ) \\"samurai,\\" (侍) and \\"sushi\\" (:ja:寿司). Hawaii is also unique in the United States in that Japanese loanwords often retain Japanese pronunciation, as in the tapped \\"r\\" sound even in words that have entered the American English dictionary such as \\"karaoke\\" and \\"karate.\\" However, as several varieties of Japanese cultural influence in the US in general has increased over the years, it has further bolstered the uses of Japanese terminology in Hawaii. Japanese food has increased in popularity and availability, most notably in the history of sushi in the US and Top Ramen, plus in the 21st century, ramen restaurants. Poke restaurants, centered around the Hawaiian dish, also have food with Japanese influences. Another variety of cultural influence has been the increasing fandom and availability of anime and manga as early as the 1980s with that era's Viz Japanese comics in English and Mangajin magazine. This fandom brought in the name \\"cosplay\\" and expanded its practice in a wider audience. Some words are not from the standard Japanese language. They instead originated from Japan's regional dialects. For example, the word \\"bobora\\" is said to be spoken only in certain prefectures, especially in western Japan where many of the Japanese immigrants came from. It originates from the Portuguese word abóbora meaning Japanese pumpkin. Food Spam musubi made from SPAM. (see definition for \\"musubi\\" below). * Anpan ([:ja:あんパン ja:あんパン], 餡パン): A sweet bread filled with azuki bean paste and sprinkled on top with sesame seeds. Usually larger than the Japanese variety. * Bentō (:ja:弁当, べんとう): Box lunch geared for portability for picnics, etc. It typically has rice, a main dish of meat or fish, and side dishes. It used to be food on a paper plate placed inside a thin cardboard box. Now, it's all in convenient styrofoam containers molded for each dish. * Furikake: A seaweed and sesame seed based condiment commonly used to season rice. * Manjū (:ja:饅頭): Confection with sweet azuki bean paste inside a flour-based outside. * Miso soup (:ja:味噌汁): Soup made of fermented soybean paste called miso. Miso- shiru in Japanese. * Mochi (:ja:餅): Rice cake made of a special kind of rice that has been pounded into a sticky mass. Mochi may be sweetened or unsweetened. Commonly pounded and eaten during New Year's, as in Japan. Sweetened azuki beans are commonly included with mochi as part of a confection. :* Mochi crunch: Rice crackers seasoned with shoyu. Also called \\"kaki mochi\\". Called arare in standard Japanese. :* Mochi ice cream: Ice cream coated with a thin layer of frozen mochi. * Musubi: Rice triangle wrapped in dried seaweed; may or may not have something in the middle, like a pickled ume or bits of fish. Spam musubi has a piece of SPAM luncheon meat on top. In Japanese the word onigiri is more commonly used for rice balls. Without further clarification, \\"musubi\\" usually implies the triangle variety (round balls of rice are only eaten at funerals). * Shoyu (:ja:醤油): Soy sauce. \\"Shoyu rice\\" is \\"soy sauce\\" sprinkled over rice. \\"Shoyu x\\" is some ingredient x cooked in soy sauce, e.g. \\"Shoyu chicken\\", \\"shoyu pork\\", \\"shoyu tofu\\". This term is so widely used that most Hawaii residents are unaware that is not the widely used English language term for soy sauce. * Sukiyaki (:ja:すき焼き): Thin slices of beef, vegetables, and tofu simmered in a skillet or pan in sukiyaki sauce. It is also the title of a No. 1 hit song in the U.S. made popular by Kyu Sakamoto in 1963. The Japanese title of the song is \\"Ue o muite arukō--it has nothing to do with the food product.) * Teriyaki (:ja:照り焼き): Grilled meat basted with a sauce made of shoyu and sugar. Meat words such as \\"chicken\\" are often appended. A common dish in plate lunches. Often shortened to \\"teri\\", e.g. \\"teri burger\\". * Tako (:ja:タコ): Octopus. Often used in a local dish called poke in which case it is called \\"tako poke\\". Objects * Benjo (:ja:便所): Toilet, interchangeable with Hawaiian-derived lua. Although originally a Japanese word with no particular connotation, in Japan, it is now considered to be crude, and many Japanese people find this term offensive. (See also: Japanese toilet). * Bobora: A country hick fresh off the boat from Japan. Also called \\"Japan bobora\\". Originally from a regional Japanese dialect, based on the Portuguese word abóbora, meaning a Japanese squash. * Boro boros: Dirty clothes, rags. Old clothes worn for activities like house painting, car repair, etc. * Chawan cut: A hairstyle that was common among little Japanese girls. It looked like someone put a bowl (茶碗, chawan) over the head and cut around the rim. In Japanese, it is called okappa, after the Japanese mythological creature called kappa which sports a similar haircut. * Daikon legs: Daikon (:ja:ダイコン or 大根) are large white radishes having a stubby shape. The term refers to Japanese women's legs which seem short and stubby. This is rumored to be the result of sitting on the floor for long periods. The Japanese equivalent is daikon ashi. * Giri-giri: The cowlick. Giri giri is an onomatopoeic word with a different meaning in standard Japanese. This use of the word originates from local dialects spoken in mainly western Japan where it means tsumuji, the standard Japanese word for the cowlick. * Hanakuso: Dried nasal mucus. Hana means nose, and kuso means waste. Kuso in Japanese typically refers to human excrement. This compound is also found in standard Japanese. * Hanabuddah (or hanabata): The fluid version of hanakuso. Bata is from English \\"butter\\". The term in Japanese is usually hanamizu (\\"nose water\\"). * Hanabuddah days: Hanabuddah is most commonly seen on young children who neglect to wipe their runny noses. Thus, hanabuddah days refers to one's youth in Hawaii. * Hashi (also ohashi): Chopsticks, as in Japanese. * \\"Kikaida\\": After the television series of the same name become enormously popular in Hawaii, \\"Kikaida\\" became a generic name for children's shows featuring superheroes. * * Shishi: Urine or urination, used in \\"go shishi\\" or \\"make shishi\\". The Double-Tongued Dictionary gives three possible etymologies for \\"shishi\\": imitative from the sound of urinating, Japanese reduplicated shi from shiko \\"urinate\\" (sic., probably shito 尿 \\"urine\\"), or Portuguese xixi \\"urinate\\". There is a Japanese kanji joke based on 五-四-四 \\"5-4-4\\", which can be read go-shi-shi in Japanese. Thus, “I gotta five-four-four” is a Pidgin euphemism for \\"I gotta go shishi\\". * Zori: Rubber thonged slippers, often called flip-flops in the continental U.S. Also zoris (plural). Synonymous with \\"slippers\\" or \\"slippahs\\". From the Japanese word zori (:ja:草履). Called \\"beach sandal\\" (:ja:ビーチサンダル) in standard Japanese. Miscellaneous * Bocha: Take a bath. Originally from bocha-bocha Japanese onomatopoeia for splashing noises. * Bon dance (:ja:盆踊り): From the Japanese Bon Festival. An annual summer dance held outside at Buddhist temples to greet the returning souls of the deceased. They dance in a circle around a tower where people sing and beat taiko drums. The most famous bon dance song is \\"Tanko-bushi\\" (炭坑節). * Buddhahead: Hawaii person of Japanese descent. “Buddha” is likely a corruption of Japanese “豚 (buta)”, meaning “pig”. In contrast, the term “Katonk” means a Japanese- American from the US mainland. * Habut/Habuteru: To feel grumpy or resentful, especially after you feel offended by something. Not standard Japanese but from Hiroshima dialect. * Jan ken po: The children's game of rock (fist), paper (open hand), and scissors (peace sign). In Japanese, either jan ken or jan ken pon. The Japanese also do not say the prelude as used in Hawaii (\\"janken na manken an saka saka po ...\\") before they show their hands (many people in Hawaii do not use this either). This jan-ken-po prelude can also differ depending on the island. * Shibai: A false act. Often refers to politicians or other influential persons who put on a false face. From the Japanese word shibai, meaning \\"a (theatre) play.\\" * Skebe: Horny. From Japanese sukebe. In Japanese, \\"H\\" (ecchi) is used for the same purpose, and sukebe refers to a pervert. * Skosh: Just a little. From Japanese sukoshi \\"a little\\".

It is a value-addedValue added and non value added process steps, ASU blog process involving the creation of machines, parts, and structures from various raw materials. Typically, a fabrication shop bids on a job, usually based on engineering drawings, and if awarded the contract, builds the product. Large fab shops employ a multitude of value-added processes, including welding, cutting, forming and machining. As with other manufacturing processes, both human labor and automation are commonly used. A fabricated product may be called a fabrication, and shops specializing in this type of work are called fab shops. The end products of other common types of metalworking, such as machining, metal stamping, forging, and casting, may be similar in shape and function, but those processes are not classified as fabrication. Processes *Cutting is done by sawing, shearing, or chiseling (all with manual and powered variants); torching with handheld torches (such as oxy-fuel torches or plasma torches); and via numerical control (CNC) cutters (using a laser, mill bits, torch, or water jet). Sunday, 17 March 2019 *Bending is done by hammering (manual or powered) or via press brakes, tube benders and similar tools. Modern metal fabricators use press brakes to coin or air-bend metal sheet into form. CNC- controlled backgauges use hard stops to position cut parts to place bend lines in specific positions. * Assembling (joining of pieces) is done by welding, binding with adhesives, riveting, threaded fasteners, or further bending in the form of crimped seams. Structural steel and sheet metal are the usual materials for fabrication; welding wire, flux and/or fasteners are used to join the cut pieces. Fabrication comprises or overlaps with various metalworking specialties: * Fabrication shops and machine shops have overlapping capabilities, but fabrication shops generally concentrate on metal preparation and assembly (as described above). Machine shops cut metal, but focus primarily on the machining of parts on machine tools. Some firms do both fab work and machining. * Blacksmithing has always involved fabrication, although that term has not always been used. *Welder-produced products, often referred to as weldments, are examples of fabrication. * Boilermakers originally specialized in fabricating boilers, but the term is now used more broadly. *Millwrights originally specialized in setting up grain mills and saw mills, but now perform a wide range of fabrication. * Ironworkers, also known as steel erectors, also engage in fabrication. They often work with prefabricated segments, produced in fab shops, that are delivered to the site.  Raw materials  Standard metal fabrication materials are: *Plate metal *Formed and expanded metal **Tube stock *Welding wire/welding rod *Casting  Cutting and burning  A variety of tools are used to cut raw material. The most common cutting method is shearing. Special band saws for cutting metal have hardened blades and feed mechanisms for even cutting. Abrasive cut-off saws, also known as chop saws, are similar to miter saws but have a steel- cutting abrasive disks. Cutting torches can cut large sections of steel with little effort. Burn tables are CNC (computer-operated) cutting torches, usually powered by natural gas. Plasma and laser cutting tables, and water jet cutters, are also common. Plate steel is loaded on the table and the parts are cut out as programmed. The support table consists of a grid of bars that can be replaced when worn. Higher-end burn tables may include CNC punch capability using a carousel of punches and taps. In fabrication of structural steel by plasma and laser cutting, robots move the cutting head in three dimensions around the cut material.  Forming  Forming converts flat sheet metal into 3-D parts by applying force without adding or removing material. The force must be great enough to change the metal's initial shape. Forming can be controlled with tools such as punches and dies. Machinery can regulate force magnitude and direction. Machine-based forming can combine forming and welding to produce lengths of fabricated sheeting (e.g. linear grating for water drainage). Proper design and use of tools with machinery creates a repeatable form that can be used to create products for many industries, including jewelry, aerospace, automotive, construction, civil and architectural.  Machining  Machining is a specialized trade of removing material from a block of metal to make it a desired shape. Fab shops generally have some machining capability, using metal lathes, mills, drills, and other portable machining tools. Most solid components, such as gears, bolts, screws and nuts, are machined.  Welding  Welding is the main focus of steel fabrication. Formed and machined parts are assembled and tack-welded in place, then rechecked for accuracy. If multiple weldments have been ordered, a fixture may be used to locate parts for welding. A welder then finishes the work according to engineering drawings (for detailed welding) or by their own experience and judgement (if no details are provided). Special measures may be needed to prevent or correct warping of weldments due to heat. These may include redesigning the piece to require less welding, employing staggered welding, using a stout fixture, covering the weldment in sand as it cools, and post- weld straightening. Straightening of warped steel weldments is done with an oxyacetylene torch. In this highly specialized work, heat is selectively applied to the steel in a slow, linear sweep, causing the steel to contract in the direction of the sweep as it cools. A highly skilled welder can remove significant warpage this way. Steel weldments are occasionally annealed in a low-temperature oven to relieve residual stresses. Such weldments, particularly those for engine blocks, may be line-bored after heat treatment.  Final assembly  After the weldment has cooled, it is generally sandblasted, primed and painted. Any additional manufacturing is then performed, and the finished product is inspected and shipped.  Specialties  Many fabrication shops offer specialty processes, including : *Casting *Powder coating *Powder metallurgy *Welding *Machining  See also  *Contract manufacturing *Electrical discharge machining *Form, fit and function *Interchangeable parts *Manufacturing engineering References Sheet metal fabrication ","title":"Metal fabrication"},{"id":"1145333","text":"\\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" (originally known as \\"Carol of the Drum\\") is a popular Christmas song written by the American classical music composer and teacher Katherine Kennicott Davis in 1941. First recorded in 1951 by the Trapp Family Singers, the song was further popularized by a 1958 recording by the Harry Simeone Chorale; the Simeone version was re-released successfully for several years and the song has been recorded many times since. In the lyrics, the singer relates how, as a poor young boy, he was summoned by the Magi to the Nativity of Jesus. Without a gift for the Infant, the little drummer boy played his drum with approval from Jesus' mother, Mary, recalling, \\"I played my best for him\\" and \\"He smiled at me\\". Origins K.K. Davis' \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" was first recorded in 1950 as \\"Carol of the Drum\\" The song was originally titled \\"Carol of the Drum\\" and was published by Davis based upon a traditional Czech song. Davis's interest was in producing material for amateur and girls' choirs: Her manuscript is set as a chorale, in which the tune is in the soprano melody with alto harmony, tenor and bass parts producing the \\"drum rhythm\\" and a keyboard accompaniment \\"for rehearsal only\\". It is headed \\"Czech Carol freely transcribed by K.K.D.\\", these initials then deleted and replaced with \\"C.R.W. Robinson\\", a name under which Davis sometimes published. The Czech original of the carol has never been identified. \\"Carol of the Drum\\" appealed to the Austrian Trapp Family Singers, who first brought the song to wider prominence when they recorded it for Decca Records in 1951 on their first album for Decca. Their version was credited solely to Davis and published by Belwin-Mills. In 1957 it was recorded, with a slightly altered arrangement by Jack Halloran for his Jack Halloran Singers on their Dot Records album Christmas Is A-Comin'. This arrangement is the one commonly sung today. However, the recording was not released as a single that year. In response to this, Dot producer Henry Onorati, who left Dot to become the new head of 20th Century Fox Records in 1958Anonymous, \\"20th Fox set with 1st Disk Releases.\\" Billboard April 21, 1958., introduced the song to Harry Simeone. When 20th Century Fox Records contracted with Simeone to make a Christmas album, Simeone hired many of the same singers that had sung in Halloran's version and made a near-identical recording with his newly created Harry Simeone Chorale. It was released as a single in 1958, and later on the album, Sing We Now of Christmas. The only difference between Simeone's version and Halloran's version, was that Simeone's contained finger cymbals, and had been retitled The Little Drummer Boy. Simeone and Onorati claimed and received joint composition credits with Davis, although the two did not actually compose, write, or arrange it. Halloran never received a writing credit for the song, something his family disagrees with.Estrella, E. (8 February 2019). How the 'Little Drummer Boy' Christmas Carol Came to Be. Retrieved from https://web.archive.org/web/20191123173121/https://www.liveabout.com/little- drummer-boy-history-2456078 The album and the song were an enormous success, with the single scoring in the top 40 of the U.S. music charts from 1958 to 1962. In 1965, Simeone, who had signed with Kapp Records in 1964, re-recorded a new version of the song for his album O' Bambino: The Little Drummer Boy.Record catalogue number: KL-1450, Track 1, Length 3:18. https://web.archive.org/web/20200612172108/https://img.discogs.com/8hybpZn4AWM1unnoQdfdOI7gjig=/fit- in/593x600/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs- images/R-2368195-1279935193.jpeg.jpg This version (3:18 play time) was recorded in stereo, had a slightly slower tempo, and contained different- sounding cymbals. Simeone recorded the song a third and final time in 1981 (3:08 play time), for an album, again titled, The Little Drummer Boy, on the budget Holiday Records label.

It consists of of woodlands, lakes and rivers. Prominent in the park are many bald cypress trees. Tree-filled lagoons and a mixed pine and hardwood forest combine to create a unique natural environment. The area hosts an abundance of wildlife, including deer, squirrels, bobcats, rabbits, alligators, otters, nutria rats, raccoons, foxes, and diverse birdlife. Ducks and geese are usually found swimming in the ponds. Originally named for Sam Houston, the Texas folk hero who traveled extensively in the western reaches of Louisiana, its current name is in honor of former Louisiana governor Sam Houston Jones, who was instrumental in setting aside this tract of land for the public to enjoy. Facilities include campsites, cabins, a boat launch, rental boats, a scenic picnic area with pavilions, a playground and restrooms. The site is located in the Central Migratory Flyway and just north of the most productive birding region in Louisiana. In the spring and fall, migratory patterns bring nearly 200 bird species within of the park site. The numerous waterways in this area make water sports a natural highlight at the park. Two boat launches are conveniently located on the West Fork of the Calcasieu River, providing access to the Gulf of Mexico, only a few miles away. Rental boats are available those who simply wish to take in the serene beauty of the park's ponds or for fishing. The three hiking trails winding through this beautiful park make strolling or serious hiking, pleasurable. Hikers may visit the old stagecoach road to explore the park and the banks of the various tributaries to the Calcasieu River. Hours of Operation are 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sunday through Thursday. All park sites close at 10 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and days preceding holidays.

It can be used both to treat and to prevent heart-related chest pain; however, it is generally less preferred than beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, low blood pressure with standing, blurry vision, and skin flushing. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure especially if also exposed to PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. Use is not recommended in pregnancy. It is believed to work by relaxing smooth muscle within blood vessels. It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1981. It is available as a generic medication. A month's supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about one pound sterling per month as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$4.30. In 2017, it was the 111th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than six million prescriptions. Medical uses Isosorbide mononitrate is a nitrate-class drug used for the prevention of angina pectoris. Adverse effects The following adverse effects have been reported in studies with isosorbide mononitrate: Very common: Headache predominates (up to 30%) necessitating withdrawal of 2 to 3% of patients, but the incidence reduces rapidly as treatment continues. Common: Tiredness, sleep disturbances (6%) and gastrointestinal disturbances (6%) have been reported during clinical trials with isosorbide mononitrate modified- release tablets, but at a frequency no greater than for placebo. Hypotension (4 to 5%), poor appetite (2.5%), nausea (1%) Adverse effects associated with the clinical use of the drug are as expected with all nitrate preparations. They occur mainly in the early stages of treatment. Hypotension (4%) with symptoms such as dizziness and nausea (1%) have been reported. In general, these symptoms disappear during long-term treatment. Other reactions that have been reported with isosorbide mononitrate-modified release tablets include tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhoea, vertigo, and heartburn. Interactions * Sildenafil (Viagra). Concomitant administration of isosorbide mononitrate and sildenafil (Viagra) or other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Tadalafil and Udenafil) can potentiate the vasodilatory effect of isosorbide mononitrate with the potential result of serious side-effects such as syncope or myocardial infarction. Life-threatening hypotension may also occur. Therefore, sildenafil should not be given to patients already receiving isosorbide mononitrate therapy. * Sulfhydryl-containing compounds. The metabolism of organic nitrates to nitric oxide is dependent on the presence of sulfhydryl groups in the muscle. The combination of oral N-acetylcysteine and a single dose of sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg significantly prolonged the total exercise time in patients with angina pectoris and angiographically proven significant coronary artery disease, when compared with isosorbide mononitrate alone. Concomitant administration of other exogenous sources of sulfhydryl groups such as methionine and captopril may produce a similar interaction. * Phenylalkylamine calcium antagonists. The addition of a calcium channel blocker of the verapamil type, such as gallopamil 75 mg, has been shown to further improve left ventricular functional parameters when given in combination with isosorbide mononitrate in a sustained-release formulation. * Propranolol. The addition of isosorbide mononitrate to propranolol treatment in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension caused a marked fall in portal pressure, a reduction in hepatic blood flow, cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure, but no additional change in azygos blood flow. The additional effect of isosorbide mononitrate was especially evident in patients whose portal pressure was not reduced by propranolol. * Calcium antagonists (general). Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium antagonists and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agent may be necessary. Brand names It is sold in the US by Lannett Company, under the trade name Monoket, and was also sold in the US under the name Imdur, and marketed in the UK under the trade names: Isotard, Monosorb, Chemydur. In India, this drug is available under the brand names of Ismo, Imdur, Isonorm, Monotrate, Solotrate, and Monit. In Russia it is occasionally used under the brand names Monocinque and Pektrol. In Australia, this drug is available under the brand name Duride.

Estimates of the Nuba population vary widely; the Sudanese government estimated that they numbered 1.07 million in 2003.South Kordofan The term should not be confused with the Nubians, an ethnic group speaking the Nubian languages, although the Hill Nubians, who live in the Nuba Mountains, are also considered part of the Nuba geographic grouping of peoples. Description =Dwellings= A Nuba village in the Nuba Mountains The Nuba people reside in the foothills of the Nuba Mountains. Villages consist of family compounds, and the men's (Holua) in which unmarried men sleep. A family compound consisting of a rectangular compound enclosing two round mud huts thatched with sorghum stalks facing each other called a shal. The shal was fenced with wooden posts interwoven with straw. Two benches ran down the each side of the shal with a fire in the middle where families will tell stories and oral traditions. Around the shal was the much larger yard, the tog placed in front. The fence of the tog was made of strong tree branches as high as the roof of the huts. Small livestock like goats and chickens and donkeys were kept in the tog. Each compound had tall conical granaries called durs which stood on one side of the tog. At the back of the compound was a small yard were maize and vegetables like pumpkin, beans and peanuts were grown. For families that were small a compound was not needed and a mud hut with a fence would be enough. The entrance was as large as a man so people could climb the ladder and dive in to get grain. Inside the hut there was very little furniture, only a bamboo bed frame with a baobab rope mat on top and the hearth in the middle with firewood. Possessions and tools were hung or leaned against the wall. A small garden behind the hut was used to grow vegetables like beans and pumpkin while sorghum and peanuts were grown away in the hills. One's wealth is measured by cattle so they are kept in an enclosure called a coh for cows and a cohnih for calves. The Nuba people eat sorghum as their staple. It is boiled with water or milk to make kal eaten with meat stew called waj. Corn is also roasted and eaten with home made butter. =Languages= The Nuba people speak various languages not closely related to each other. Most of the Nuba people speak one of the many languages in the geographic Kordofanian languages group of the Nuba Mountains. This language group is primarily in the major Niger–Congo language family. Several Nuba languages are in the Nilo-Saharan language family. Over one hundred languages are spoken in the area and are considered Nuba languages, although many of the Nuba also speak Sudanese Arabic, the official language of Sudan. A Nuba woman =Culture= The Nuba people are primarily farmers, as well as herders who keep cattle, chickens, and other domestic animals. They often maintain three different farms: a garden near their where vegetables needing constant attention, such as onions, peppers and beans, are grown; fields further up the hills where quick growing crops such as red millet can be cultivated without irrigation; and farms farther away, where white millet and other crops are planted. A distinctive characteristic of the Nubas is their passion for athletic competition, particularly traditional wrestling. The strongest young men of a community compete with athletes from other villages for the chance to promote their personal and their village’s pride and strength. In some villages, older men participate in club- or spear-fighting contests. The Nubas’ passion for physical excellence is also displayed through the young men’s vanity—they often spend hours painting their bodies with complex patterns and decorations. This vanity reflects the basic Nuba belief in the power and importance of strength and beauty. Religions The primary religion of many Nuba people is Islam, with some Christians, and traditional shamanistic beliefs also prevailing. Men wear a sarong and occasionally a skull cap. Young men remained naked, while children wear only a string of beads. Older women and young women wear beads and wrap a sarong over their legs and sometimes a cloak tie on the shoulder. Both sexes practice scarification and circumcision/female genital mutilation. Men shave their heads, older men wear beards, women and girls braid their hair in strands and string it with beads. The majority of the Nuba living in the east, west and northern parts of the mountains are Muslims, while those living to the south are either Christians or practice traditional animistic religions. In those areas of the Nuba mountains where Islam has not deeply penetrated, ritual specialists and priests hold as much control as the clan elders, for it is they who are responsible for rain control, keeping the peace, and rituals to insure successful crops. Many are guardians of the shrines where items are kept to insure positive outcomes of the rituals (such as rain stones for the rain magic), and some also undergo what they recognize as spiritual possession. Politics In the 1986 elections, the National Umma Party lost several seats to the Nuba Mountains General Union and to the Sudan National Party, due to the reduced level of support from the Nuba Mountains region. There is reason to believe that attacks by the government-supported militia, the Popular Defense Force (PDF), on several Nuba villages were meant to be in retaliation for this drop in support, which was seen as signaling increased support of the SPLA. The PDF attacks were particularly violent, and have been cited as examples of crimes against humanity that took place during the Second Sudanese Civil War (Salih 1999).  Nuba Mountains  The Nuba people reside in one of the most remote and inaccessible places in all of Sudan, the foothills of the Nuba Mountains in central Sudan. At one time the area was considered a place of refuge, bringing together people of many different tongues and backgrounds who were fleeing oppressive governments and slave traders. The Nuba Mountains mark the southern border of the sands of the desert and the northern limit of good soils washed down by the Nile River. Many Nubas, however, have migrated to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum to escape persecution and the effects of Sudan’s civil war. Most of the rest of the 1,000,000 Nuba people live in villages and towns of between 1,000 and 50,000 inhabitants in areas in and surrounding the Nuba mountains. Nuba villages are often built where valleys run from the hills out on to the surrounding plains, because water is easier to find at such points and wells can be used all year long. There is no political unity among the various Nuba groups who live on the hills. Often the villages do not have chiefs but are instead organized into clans or extended family groups with village authority left in the hands of clan elders.  War in the Nuba Mountains  =Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005)= After some earlier incursions by the SPLA, the Second Sudanese Civil War started full scale in the Nuba Mountains when the Volcano Battalion of the SPLA under the command of the Nuba Yousif Kuwa Mekki and Abdel Aziz Adam al-Hillu entered the Nuba Mountains and began to recruit Nuba volunteers and send them to SPLA training facilities in Ethiopia. The volunteers walked to Ethiopia and back and many of them perished on the way. During the war, the SPLA generally held the Mountains, while the Sudanese Army held the towns and fertile lands at the feet of the Mountains, but was generally unable to dislodge the SPLA, even though the latter was usually very badly supplied. The Governments of Sudan under Sadiq al-Mahdi and Omar al- Bashir also armed militias of Baggara Arabs to fight the Nuba and transferred many Nuba forcibly to camps. In early 2002 the Government and the SPLA agreed on an internationally supervised ceasefire. International observers and advisors were quickly dispatched to Kadugli base camp and several deployed into the mountains to co-located with SPLA command elements. The base camp at Kauda for several observers included Swiss African advisor, French diplomat, an Italian and an American former US Army officer. At that time, Abdel Aziz Adam al-Hillu was the governor of Nuba Mountains. During the course of the following months, relief supplies from the UN were air dropped to stem the starvation of many in Nuba Mountains. The ceasefire in Nuba Mountains was the foundation for the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed in January 2005. This fragile peace remains in force, but infighting in the south, plus the Government of Sudan involvement in Darfur have resulted in issues which may break the peace agreement. =Secession of South Sudan (2011)= Southern Sudan voted for secession from Sudan in the Southern Sudanese independence referendum, 2011. This provision was agreed to in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). The secession victory established the formation of a new country, South Sudan, from the southern portion of Sudan. However, conflict between Northern and Southern forces, and against the Nuba peoples, renewed again in the region in 2011 — see Sudan–SPLM-N conflict (2011) for detailed information. Media *Film maker Roopa Gogineni documented Bisha TV, a satirical muppet show popular throughout the Nuba lands, which serves as an \\"example of how people use comedy to deal with authoritarian rule.\\" The show mocks Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, depicting him as the killer of children and bomber of hospitals. A short documentary by Gogineni includes apparent bombing of Kauda by a Soviet-made Antonov airplane. It shows a public screening of Bisha TV in front of dozens of local residents. *2012 Eyes and Ears Of God – Video surveillance of Sudan film by peace activist Tomo Križnar on YouTube. The documentary film shows the ethnic Nuba civilians defending themselves with the help of over 400 cameras distributed by himself and Klemen Mihelič, the founder of humanitarian organisation H.O.P.E., to volunteers across the war zones in the Nuba Mountains, Blue Nile, and Darfur, documenting the (North) Sudan military's war crimes against local populations.About the documentary on Tomo Križnar's website *Leni Riefenstahl, better known for directing Triumph of the Will and Olympia, published two collections of her photographs of Nuba peoples, titled The Last of the Nuba (1973) and The People of Kau (1976). *Nuba Conversations (2000), a documentary and ethnographic film directed by Arthur Howes.

It was used in British tanks up to 1964. It was a result of co-operation between Leyland Motors and Rolls-Royce who between them in 1941 had suggested that a specialised de-rated version of the latter company's Merlin aero-engine would be highly suitable for use in armoured fighting vehicles. The Meteor was developed from the Merlin by W. A. Robotham and his chassis design and development division at Clan Foundry, Belper, as they were not involved in aero-engine work and his engineers were under-used. With the aid of engineers from Leyland, who were engaged in tank work, he considered RR's two V12s; the Kestrel, while having more power than the existing \\"Liberty\\" or Meadows engines, did not provide the desirable 20 bhp per ton required, so the 1,030 bhp (770 kW) Merlin III was chosen. Robotham was at pains to point out that Rolls-Royce could not manufacture the engines, so would not benefit commercially. The Directorate of Tank Design (DTD), on 27 April 1941, supported production of the Meteor, eventually placing orders direct with Rolls-Royce to maintain development in connection with the Cromwell tank. A new tank specification, A27M, was produced for design of the Meteor-powered tank. The Meteor engine went on to become one of the most successful British tank engines. Design and development =Engine design= Development started with the use of recovered Merlin engine parts from crashed aircraft. While unsuitable for re-use in aircraft, the Rolls- Royce chassis division had begun collecting and refurbishing them in the hopes of finding a use. Robotham was approached by Henry Spurrier of Leyland Mechanization and Aero, to ask about help with tank powerplants. Based on Spurrier's requirement, the first prototype Meteor engine (and subsequent production of Mark 1 engines) was assembled on the basis of recovered Merlin parts. The major change for tank use was reversing the direction of engine rotation. Automotive gearboxes ran the opposite way to an aircraft propeller and changing direction required modification of the camshaft lobes. The Merlin had its supercharger, reduction gear and other equipment removed from its crankshaft, greatly simplifying its construction. The dimensions were now similar to the Nuffield Liberty engine and it would fit into the Liberty Mark VI version in the Crusader tank. The Merlin's dual ignition system was retained, each cylinder possessing two sparking plugs each driven from separate magnetos. A Crusader tank, similar to as used in trials The first Merlin prepared for tank use was tried in a modified Crusader in September 1941 at Aldershot. The test team had trouble timing its runs because it was so fast, estimating it reached . This proved the concept, and the engine was tried in the Crusader tank, surpassing all expectations. The engine was commissioned for use in the new Cromwell tank. Changes were made to the Cromwell tank development programme to accommodate the new engine. To enable fitting in-line with a Merrit-Brown gear (and steering) box, the engine was lowered. A new flat sump was created, the oil pumps changed and the crankshaft could now line up with the new gearbox. Many of the aircraft specific parts of the engine were deleted, such as the propeller reduction gear and the aircraft-style starter. The new engine had cast, rather than forged, pistons and was de-rated to around 600 bhp (447 kW), running on lower-octane pool petrol instead of high-octane aviation fuel. British Thomson-Houston (BTH) Magnetos were changed for Simms units. =Expansion into tank design= The engine, and the Rolls-Royce team's fresh look at tank development, had a major impact on British tank design. As development of the engine progressed, the Rolls Royce team became more and more involved in development of the tank. Despite his lack of experience in tank design or warfare, Robotham was made Chief Engineer of Tank Design and joined the Tank Board. He was involved in the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank. The Rolls Royce chassis division, which had commenced the Meteor design, evolved into its Tank Division at Belper and was involved with the overall design of four versions of the Cromwell tank, using a standard set of components. Production Cromwell tank showing its speed during official inspection Early prototypes were produced by Rolls Royce. In 1941, Leyland, which had an order for 1,200 Meteor engines, was still advocating its own diesel tank engine for the Cromwell tank. It would deliver only , but it was concerned with the problem of sufficient cooling for the Meteor within the confines of the tank engine bay. When Leyland withdrew its support, Robotham took the problem to Ernest Hives. Hives took the problem to the Ministry of Supply, telling Lord Beaverbrook that he already had his hands full making Merlin aero engines, and Rolls-Royce would want £1 million to its credit and 'no interference' to make tank engines, Beaverbrook telegrammed back, An order for 1,000 engines followed, and a new tank design specification was created: A27M, splitting design of the Meteor powered Cromwell away from Leyland to Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRC&W;). They resolved the cooling problems, ultimately delivering before Leyland's version, although production leadership later switched back to Leyland when BRC&W; could not keep up with demand. The Meteor was initially produced by Rolls-Royce but manufacturing capacity was severely limited due to the demand for Merlin engines. Early units were still manufactured using recovered Merlin parts and many early Meteors still showed crash damage. When engine manufacturing needed to increase output, brand new engines had to be made. Because weight saving was not so important for a tank engine, some of the Merlin's more expensive light-alloy components were replaced with cheaper, steel versions. It was also envisaged that the Meteor would use some components rejected on quality grounds for the Merlin, i.e. Merlin scrap.Sidgreaves Many of these rejected parts while not meeting strict standards for airworthiness, were perfectly adequate for use in ground vehicles where the crew or operators were not subject to the inherent hazards involved in flight. To increase production, Meadows produced some Meteors but the small factory of 2,000 men was producing 40 types of engine. To make enough Meteors for the Cromwell build programme, Rolls-Royce agreed to move Meteor production to the Rover Company at Tyseley and Morris at Coventry. Rolls-Royce was also aiding the development of production jet engines at Rover, but progress there was slow and Rover became disillusioned. Hives struck a deal in December 1942 with Spencer Wilks of Rover to trade W.2B/23 production at Barnoldswick for the Rolls-Royce tank engine factory in Nottingham and production of the Meteor, to become officially effective on 1 April 1943. In 1943, an acute shortage of blocks was met by dismantling surplus older marks of Merlin. Rover took over the Meteor in January 1944 and in 1946 the British Government made Rover responsible for research and development of large military engines. In this role, Rover continued the development and production of the Meteor Mk IVb and various derivatives, including the Meteorite V8 and the M120 V12. Rover ceased this activity in 1964, having produced approximately 9,000 engines and Rolls-Royce again became responsible for the manufacture of spare parts. Future engines for British tanks were manufactured by the engine division Rolls-Royce Diesels of Shrewsbury, which was acquired by Perkins in the 1980s. Perkins was taken over by Caterpillar Inc in 1997. Performance Previously British tanks had been regarded as underpowered and unreliable and the Meteor is considered to be the engine that, for the first time, gave British tanks ample, reliable power. Replacing the earlier Liberty L-12 licence-built by Nuffield and used in the Crusader, the Meteor engine in the Cromwell tank provided almost twice the performance in virtually the same displacement. Reliability was significantly improved against previous tank engines. From its R-R Merlin origins, the Meteor was very lightly stressed and reliable. With the introduction of the Meteor engine in the Cromwell, originally intended for the Liberty, the boost to gave the vehicle exceptional mobility and speed. This increase in power made it possible to integrate greater armour on following tanks. Designers and military planners started to consider the possibility of a Universal tank, able to undertake both high-armour (Infantry tank) and high-mobility (Cruiser tank) roles. Ultimately, this resulted in the Centurion tank and evolved into the main battle tank concept. Applications The Meteor was used in the following vehicles: * Cromwell * Challenger * Avenger, a reworked design of Challenger for use as self-propelled artillery. * Comet * Centurion * Charioteer * Tortoise experimental assault tank. * Caernarvon, used to train crews for Conqueror * Conqueror post war heavy tank The Meteor was also used as the propulsion for the experimental Helmore Projector, later known as the Helmover, a 30ft long remote controlled torpedo.

Extents of rule and ways of achieving governing authority are varied. For example, dominion theology can include theonomy, but does not necessarily involve advocating Mosaic law as the basis of government. The label is applied primarily toward groups of Christians in the United States. Prominent adherents of these ideologies are Calvinist Christian reconstructionism, Charismatic and Pentecostal Kingdom Now theology, New Apostolic Reformation, and perhaps others not identified. Most of the contemporary movements labeled dominion theology arose in the 1970s from religious movements asserting aspects of Christian nationalism. Some have applied the term dominionist more broadly to the whole Christian right. This usage is controversial. Some members of these communities are concerned that this is a label being used to marginalize Christians from public discourse.  Etymology  Dominion theology is a reference to the King James Bible's rendering of Genesis 1:28, the passage in which God grants humanity \\"dominion\\" over the Earth. > And God blessed them, and God said unto them, \\"Be fruitful, and multiply, > and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of > the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that > moveth upon the earth.\\" In the late 1980s, several prominent evangelical authors used the phrase dominion theology (and other terms such as dominionism) to label a loose grouping of theological movements that made direct appeals to this passage in Genesis. Christians typically interpret this passage as meaning that God gave mankind responsibility over the Earth, but one of the distinctive aspects of dominion theology is that it is interpreted as a mandate for Christian stewardship in civil affairs, no less than in other human matters.  Types  = Christian reconstructionism = An example of dominionism in reformed theology is Christian reconstructionism, which originated with the teachings of R. J. Rushdoony in the 1960s and 1970s. Rushdoony's theology focuses on theonomy (the rule of the Law of God), a belief that all of society should be ordered according to the laws that governed the Israelites in the Old Testament. His system is strongly Calvinistic, emphasizing the sovereignty of God over human freedom and action, and denying the operation of charismatic gifts in the present day (cessationism); both of these aspects are in direct opposition to Kingdom Now Theology. Full adherents to reconstructionism are few and marginalized among most Christians. Dave Hunt,Hunt, Dave 1988. Whatever Happened to Heaven? Harvest House.

Michael J. McVicar has noted that many leading Christian reconstructionists are also leading writers in paleolibertarian circles. Some social scientists have used the word dominionism to refer to adherence to Christian reconstructionism. = Kingdom Now theology = Kingdom Now theology is a branch of dominion theology which has had a following within Pentecostalism. It attracted attention in the late 1980s. Kingdom Now theology states that although Satan has been in control of the world since the Fall, God is looking for people who will help him take back dominion. Those who yield themselves to the authority of God's apostles and prophets will take control of the kingdoms of this world, being defined as all social institutions, the \\"kingdom\\" of education, the \\"kingdom\\" of science, the \\"kingdom\\" of the arts, etc. C. Peter Wagner, the founder of the New Apostolic Reformation, writes: \\"The practical theology that best builds a foundation under social transformation is dominion theology, sometimes called 'Kingdom Now'. Its history can be traced back through R. J. Rushdoony and Abraham Kuyper to John Calvin.\\" Kingdom Now theology is influenced by the Latter Rain movement, and critics have connected it to the New Apostolic Reformation, \\"Spiritual Warfare Christianity,\\" and Fivefold ministry thinking. Kingdom Now theology should not be confused with Kingdom theology, which is related to inaugurated eschatology.  Dominionism and the Christian right  In the late 1980s sociologist Sara Diamond began writing about the intersection of dominion theology with the political activists of the Christian right. Diamond argued that \\"the primary importance of the [Christian reconstructionist] ideology is its role as a catalyst for what is loosely called 'dominion theology'\\". According to Diamond, \\"Largely through the impact of Rushdoony's and North's writings, the concept that Christians are Biblically mandated to 'occupy' all secular institutions has become the central unifying ideology for the Christian Right\\" (emphasis in original) in the United States. While acknowledging the small number of actual adherents, authors such as Diamond and Frederick Clarkson have argued that postmillennial Christian reconstructionism played a major role in pushing the primarily premillennial Christian right to adopt a more aggressive dominionist stance. Misztal and Shupe concur that \\"Reconstructionists have many more sympathizers who fall somewhere within the dominionist framework, but who are not card- carrying members\\".Bruce Barron and Anson Shupe, 1992, \\"Reasons for the Growing Popularity of Christian Reconstructionism: The Determination to Attain Dominion\\", in Bronislaw Misztal and Anson D. Shupe, eds. Religion and politics in comparative perspective: revival of religious fundamentalism in East and West. Westport, Conn: Praeger, p.85. According to Diamond, \\"Reconstructionism is the most intellectually grounded, though esoteric, brand of dominion theology\\". Journalist Frederick Clarkson defined dominionism as a movement that, while including dominion theology and reconstructionism as subsets, is much broader in scope, extending to much of the Christian right in the United States. In his 1992 study of dominion theology and its influence on the Christian right, Bruce Barron writes, > In the context of American evangelical efforts to penetrate and transform > public life, the distinguishing mark of a dominionist is a commitment to > defining and carrying out an approach to building society that is self- > consciously defined as exclusively Christian, and dependent specifically on > the work of Christians, rather than based on a broader consensus. In 1995, Diamond called the influence of dominion theology \\"prevalent on the Christian Right\\".Diamond, Sara. 1995. \\"Dominion Theology.\\" Z Magazine, February 1995 Journalist Chip Berlet added in 1998 that, although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists assert a Christian duty to take \\"control of a sinful secular society\\".Chip Berlet, \\"Following the Threads,\\" in Ansell, Amy E. Unraveling the Right: The New Conservatism in American Thought and Politics, pp. 24, Westview Press, 1998, In 2005, Clarkson enumerated the following characteristics shared by all forms of dominionism: > #Dominionists celebrate Christian nationalism, in that they believe that the > United States once was, and should once again be, a Christian nation. In > this way, they deny the Enlightenment roots of American democracy. > #Dominionists promote religious supremacy, insofar as they generally do not > respect the equality of other religions, or even other versions of > Christianity. #Dominionists endorse theocratic visions, insofar as they > believe that the Ten Commandments, or \\"biblical law,\\" should be the > foundation of American law, and that the U.S. Constitution should be seen as > a vehicle for implementing Biblical principles.

Some authors have applied the term to a broader spectrum of people than have Diamond, Clarkson, and Berlet. Sarah Posner in Salon argues that there are various \\"iterations of dominionism that call on Christians to enter ... government, law, media and so forth ... so that they are controlled by Christians\\". According to Posner, \\"Christian right figures promoted dominionism ... and the GOP courted ... religious leaders for the votes of their followers\\". She added: \\"If people really understood dominionism, they’d worry about it between election cycles.\\"Sarah Posner, 2011, The Christian right's 'dominionist' strategy: The emergence of Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann as top presidential candidates is a story 30 years in the making\\" Salon, August 21, Michelle Goldberg notesMichelle Goldberg, 2006, \\"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism,\\" Salon, May 12, that George Grant wrote in his 1987 book The Changing of the Guard: Biblical Principles for Political Action: = A spectrum of dominionism = Writers including Chip BerletChip Berlet The Christian Right, Dominionism, and Theocracy: Part Two and Frederick Clarkson distinguish between what they term \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" dominionism.

Michelle Goldberg uses the terms Christian nationalism and dominionism for the former view. According to Goldberg: > In many ways, Dominionism is more a political phenomenon than a theological > one.

Unlike \\"dominionism\\", the phrase \\"Christian nation\\" occurs commonly in the writings of leaders of the Christian right. Proponents of this idea (such as David Barton and D. James Kennedy) argue that the Founding Fathers of the United States were overwhelmingly Christian, that founding documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are based on Christian principles, and that a Christian character is fundamental to American culture.Barton, David 1993.

They cite, for example, the U.S. Supreme Court's comment in 1892 that \\"this [the United States] is a Christian nation\\",Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U.S. 457, 12 S.Ct. 511, 36 L.Ed. 226, 29 February 1892 after citing numerous historical and legal arguments in support of that statement. Kennedy characterized his perspective on Christian political involvement as more akin to participatory democracy than to dominionism. In an interview with NPR's Terry Gross, Kennedy was asked whether he wanted all public office holders to be Christians. Kennedy answered, \\"We have people who are secular and humanist and unbelievers who are constantly supporting in every way possible other people who share those views. And I don't object to that. That's their privilege. And I think that Christians should be allowed the same privilege to vote for people whom they believe share their views about life and government. And that's all I'm talking about.\\" = Criticism of the usage of the term dominionism = Those labelled dominionists rarely use the terms dominionist and dominionism for self-description, and some people have attacked the use of such words. Journalist and conservative comentator Anthony Williams, writing for Frontpage Magazine, charged that such usage aims \\"to smear the Republican Party as the party of domestic Theocracy, facts be damned\\". Journalist and conservative commentator Stanley Kurtz, writing for the National Review, labeled it \\"conspiratorial nonsense\\", \\"political paranoia\\", and \\"guilt by association\\", and decried Hedges' \\"vague characterizations\\" that allow him to \\"paint a highly questionable picture of a virtually faceless and nameless 'Dominionist' Christian mass\\". Kurtz also complained about a perceived link between average Christian evangelicals and extremism such as Christian reconstructionism: > The notion that conservative Christians want to reinstitute slavery and rule > by genocide is not just crazy, it's downright dangerous. The most disturbing > part of the Harper's cover story (the one by Chris Hedges) was the attempt > to link Christian conservatives with Hitler and fascism.

As a cooperative, Sun-Maid is made up of approximately 850 family farmers who grow raisin grapes within a radius of the processing plant. Sun-Maid also sources dried fruit beyond this geographical area. In 2012, Sun-Maid celebrated its 100th anniversary as a grower cooperative. Sun-Maid raisins are packaged in a red box featuring the iconic “Sun-Maid Girl” wearing a red sunbonnet and holding a tray of fresh grapes. Sun-Maid raisins are grown in the Central Valley of California, midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, a region known for its unique Mediterranean climate perfect for growing grapes and drying them to make raisins. The grapes are picked at harvest time, usually late August to early September, and dried naturally in the sun, either by hand-picking them and laying them on paper trays or allowing them to dry-on-the-vine (DOV) for mechanical harvesting. After about 14 days, they are placed in bins and delivered to the Sun-Maid plant for processing, packaging and shipping to customers throughout the United States and in more than 60 countries around the world. Sun-Maid produces more than of natural raisins annually. Nearly half of all Sun-Maid raisins are packed for consumer sales, whether in a box, a bag or a canister in varying sizes. The other half are sold as an ingredient to bakeries, cereal companies, as raisin paste and raisin concentrate. The Thompson Seedless grape is the most popular variety used to make raisins, although other grapes, such as Fiesta, Flame and Zante currants are also used. In addition to raisins, Sun-Maid packs a full line of dried fruit, such as figs, dates, cranberries, apples, prunes, apricots and tropical fruits. Sun- Maid also packs yogurt-covered raisins, such as those dipped in dark chocolate, vanilla, orange cream, strawberry-Greek and cherry-chocolate flavored yogurt. The company maintains extensive brand licensing and food service operations. The Promotion in Motion Companies, Inc., under license from Sun-Maid, produces a Sun-Maid Milk Chocolate Covered Raisins. History In 1873, Francis T. Eisen planted an experimental vineyard of Muscat grapes on along Fancher Creek, just east of Fresno. By 1878, packaged raisins were being shipped out of the state, and by 1903, California was producing 120 million pounds of raisins a year. Packing houses quickly became a vital link between the grower and the consumer, and dozens sprouted up across the San Joaquin Valley. Employing hundreds of immigrant people, these facilities received the sun-dried raisins from growers, which they stored, processed, packaged, and shipped throughout the United States and to countries around the world. When the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, farmers and immigrants from the East settled the area for the first time, and growers were able to quickly transport products from the West to new markets. In 1872, Leland Stanford brought the Central Pacific Railroad to the San Joaquin Valley, choosing a location in present-day downtown Fresno as the rail stop, Fresno Station. Depots in surrounding communities soon followed. As the railroads expanded, so too did the area surrounding Fresno Station, attracting farmers to grow agricultural products to satisfy the increasing demand from faraway markets. Many of the families suffered due to harmful chemicals that they were faced with while working on the farms. Once raisins were established as a marketable crop which grew and dried well under the Californian sun, raisin grape-growing areas expanded rapidly in the late 19th century. The earliest successful efforts to form a cooperative business by raisin growers began in 1898. With community support, the California Associated Raisin Company was established in 1912. In 1915, the brand name Sun-Maid, coined by advertising executive E.A. Berg, was launched; and in 1918 the company opened a new facility near downtown Fresno, California. By the early 1920s, the California Associated Raisin Company’s membership comprised 85 percent of the state’s raisin growers. The organization changed its name to Sun-Maid Growers of California in 1922 to identify more closely with its nationally recognized brand. In 1964, further modernization and growth led to the construction of, and move to, a new facility in neighboring Kingsburg. The facility sits on more than , and is located south of Fresno. To this day, the Kingsburg plant serves as the international headquarters of Sun-Maid Growers of California. Sun-Maid Girl First package featuring Lorraine Collett (1916) The original \\"Sun-Maid Girl\\" was a real person named Lorraine Collett. She attended the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco as one of several young girls representing the California Associated Raisin Company. The Sun-Maid girls promoted the raisin industry by handing out raisin samples to visitors of the Expo while wearing white blouses with blue piping and blue sunbonnets. A photograph of Collett appeared in the San Francisco Bulletin in 1915 and promoted Sun-Maid’s activities at the Exposition. While working at the Expo in San Francisco, Collett posed at the Post Street studio of artist Fanny Scafford in the morning, and then spent the rest of the day working the Expo, where the Sun-Maid girls were by then all wearing red bonnets. The artist experimented with a variety of positions and props, finally settling on the iconic pose with an overflowing tray of grapes and a glowing sunburst in the background. In May 1916, company executives agreed Collett would become the personification of the company. Her image with sunbonnet and tray of grapes was updated in 1956 and again in 1970, using drawings made a decade earlier of company employee Delia von Meyer (Pacheco).The Sun-Maid Girl Collett continued to make special appearances as the original Sun-Maid Girl until her death at the age of 90. The current version was created in 1970 by John Lichtenwalner, a freelance commercial artist in San Francisco. Lichtenwalner, a graduate of Art Center in Los Angeles, used the previous versions of the Sun-Maid Girl to create a cleaner version of the character. The model for the updated portrait was a young actress/model, Liz Weide. The portrait was centered over a figurative sunburst. The artwork, sold as piecework to the Sun-Maid Raisin Co., has been reproduced internationally and is perhaps the artist's best known work, unchanged for more than 40 years. In 2006, the Sun-Maid Girl was animated for television commercials in which she walked and talked for the first time. The commercials were designed and produced by Synthespian Studios.

The murderer is dubbed \\"The Fisherman\\", due to a conscious effort by the killer to emulate the methods of serial killer Albert Fish. Like Fish, French Landing's killer targets children and indulges in cannibalism of the bodies. Two victims have already been discovered as the story opens, with a third awaiting discovery. The nature of the crimes, and the local police's inability to capture the killer, have led people all over the region to become more anxious with each passing day, and certain elements of the local media exacerbate the situation with inflammatory and provocative coverage. After the events of The Talisman, Jack Sawyer has repressed the memories of his adventures in The Territories and his hunt for the Talisman as a twelve-year- old boy, though the residue of these events has served to subtly affect his life even after he has forgotten them. Jack grew up to become a lieutenant in the Los Angeles Police Department, where his professionalism and uncanny talent have helped him establish a nearly legendary reputation. When a series of murders in Los Angeles are traced to a farm insurance salesman from French Landing, Wisconsin, Jack cooperates with the French Landing police to capture the killer. While in Wisconsin, Jack is irresistibly enraptured by the natural beauty of the Coulee Country, echoing his reaction to The Territories as a child. When he later intrudes upon a homicide investigation in Santa Monica, certain aspects of the crime scene threaten to revive his repressed memories. He subsequently resigns from the LAPD, and he moves to French Landing to enjoy his early retirement. When the Fisherman begins to terrorize French Landing, the police all but beg \\"Hollywood\\" Jack Sawyer for his assistance and are surprised when he flatly refuses. Memories of the Santa Monica event threaten to overwhelm Jack, and he fears that involving himself in the investigation may break his sanity. When a fourth child is taken by the Fisherman, events no longer allow Jack to remain aloof. It quickly becomes apparent to him that the Fisherman is much more than a serial killer. In fact, he is an agent of the Crimson King, and his task is to find children with the potential to serve as Breakers. The fourth victim, Tyler Marshall, is one of the most powerful Breakers there has ever been, and he may be all the Crimson King needs to break the remaining beams of the Dark Tower and bring an end to all worlds. As the Fisherman also proves capable of \\"flipping\\" into The Territories, Jack Sawyer is the only hope of not just French Landing, but all existence. Terms * Abbalah: The Crimson King. * Coppiceman: A word that Jack uses to refer to policemen, most notably himself. The word was taken from Wolf's erroneous pronunciation of policeman in the previous book, The Talisman. * D'Yamba: A magic word Jack uses that invokes the power of good. * Opopanax: Jack is almost haunted by the word opopanax at the beginning of the story. Its meaning is given as: \\"describing a word that cannot be found in the dictionary.\\" It is also the name of the feather in Wolves of the Calla that is used to summon the Calla folken to a palaver - and also passed to anyone desiring to speak during the palaver. *Twinner: A twinner is a person's counterpart or double in another world. In the language of the Territories, \\"twinner\\" translates as \\"harp,\\" which in Jack's mind conjures the image of two strings \\"a finger touch away\\".

Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Dutch bands Epica and Within Temptation, Finnish band Nightwish, and Swedish band Therion. All four bands place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores in addition to the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. Musical characteristics The main musical influences on symphonic metal are early gothic metal, power metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. Music workstation keyboards and orchestras are often the focal point of the music, which, in essence, distinguishes the subgenre from other metal subgenres. Other instruments including guitars, bass and drums typically play relatively simple parts in contrast to the complex and nuanced keyboard and/or orchestral parts. Bands that do not use live orchestral instrumentation on their recordings or when playing live typically utilize factory presets on workstation keyboards (i. e., strings, choirs, pianos, pipe organs etc.) to conjure up a \\"pseudo-orchestral\\" sound, where parts are played idiomatically according to keyboard technique. This is particularly characteristic of less-known bands on tighter budgets. Some symphonic metal bands abstain from using keyboards entirely, choosing to use orchestral backing tracks, either recorded by a live symphony orchestra and/or choir during an album session, or recorded using virtual software instruments in a sequencer. This is particularly characteristic of bands that feature deeper and more complex arrangements that would be more difficult for one or even two keyboardists to reproduce in a live performance. It is more difficult to generalise about the guitar and bass work found in this style. As with gothic metal, this can often be described as a synthesis of other rock and metal styles, with black metal, death metal, power metal, and progressive metal elements being the most common; but unlike in gothic metal, elements of classical music are frequently present as well. With varying frequency, the majority of bands in this subgenre employ these instruments (as well as the lead vocals) to play more simple, catchy melodies which arguably makes symphonic metal (along with power metal, which shares this characteristic) one of the more accessible metal subgenres. Songs are often highly atmospheric, though more upbeat than those of other metal subgenres; even songs with morbid themes routinely feature prominent major-key fanfares. Particularly central to creating mood and atmosphere is the choice of keyboard sounds. Lyrics cover a broad range of topics. As with two of symphonic metal's otherwise most dissimilar influences, power metal and opera (but also symphonic progressive rock), fantasy and mythological themes are common. Concept albums styled after operas or epic poems are not uncommon. Bands in this genre often feature a female lead vocalist, most commonly a soprano. There is sometimes a second, male vocalist, as is also common in gothic metal. Growling, death-metal-style vocals are not unknown, but tend to be used less frequently than in other metal genres that make use of this vocal style (however, a notable example of its usage is by Mark Jansen in Epica). Further backup up to and including a full choir is sometimes employed. It is very common for bands, almost exclusively female-fronted bands, to feature operatic lead vocals. Such bands can be referred to as operatic symphonic metalThe Manitoban (PDF-file, page 25): “Opera Metal for the Masses” stored at webcitation.org and include the likes of Epica, Nightwish (Tarja Turunen, then Floor Jansen), Haggard, Therion, Operatika, Dremora, Dol Ammad, Visions of Atlantis, Aesma Daeva, Almora and countless others. The operatic style is not exclusively tied to symphonic metal, and also appears in avant-garde metal, progressive metal, gothic metal and melodic metal. Origins and evolution The roots of symphonic metal are found in early death metal and gothic metal bands, who made some use of symphonic elements in their music, notably Swiss extreme metal pioneers Celtic Frost on their 1987 album Into the Pandemonium, whose 1985 release To Mega Therion inspired the naming of symphonic metal pioneers Therion. One of the earliest symphonic metal songs was \\"Dies Irae\\" by American thrash metal group Believer. Appearing on their 1990 album Sanity Obscure, it foreshadowed the operatic approach used by the bands Therion and Nightwish. According to Jeff Wagner in his book Mean Deviation, the song was a creative watershed in metal, and except for Mekong Delta, no other extreme metal band at the time had merged the genre with classical music so seamlessly. Therion's Lori Lewis and Christofer Johnsson with symphonic orchestra and choir during the live classical show at the Miskolc Opera Festival, Hungary, 2007. The band Therion were influential in forming the genre through their use of a live orchestra and classical compositional techniques; gradually these elements became a more important part of Therion's music than their death metal roots. Another key early influence was Finnish progressive metal band Waltari's album Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! Death Metal Symphony in Deep C. In mid-1996 Rage released Lingua Mortis, the band's first collaboration with the Prague Symphony Orchestra. Nightwish and Within Temptation released their first albums in 1997, which were heavily inspired by Therion's symphonic turn. Within Temptation was more influenced by gothic metal, and therefore musically simpler than the more power metal-influenced Nightwish, but both bands shared two key symphonic metal elements - powerful female lead vocals from Tarja Turunen and Sharon den Adel respectively, and the heavy use of classically influenced keyboard playing. Haggard, which started as a progressive death metal band, had released some demos and EPs some years ago using only their death metal style, but, in 1997, they went a step forward. They chose to change their style and to turn it into a mix of classical music with real classical and medieval instruments such as, violin, viola, cello, flute, oboe, clarinet, crumhorn, keyboards and death metal, releasing their first symphonic metal studio album. Many new symphonic metal bands appeared or came to wide attention in the early to mid 2000s, including Rain Fell Within, After Forever, Epica, Delain, Leaves' Eyes, Xandria, and Edenbridge, all featuring the characteristic keyboards and female vocals. Power metal, with its relatively upbeat fantasy themes and stylized keyboard sounds, tended to be an important influence on these groups. The term \\"symphonic metal\\" has sometimes been applied to individual songs or albums by bands that are primarily death metal (including death-doom), gothic metal, power metal, or black metal. However, it is worth noting that the term is sometimes used to describe stylistic elements that can be found in nearly any heavy metal subgenre. Symphonic metal subgenres The term \\"symphonic metal\\" is used to denote any metal band that makes use of symphonic or orchestral elements; \\"symphonic metal\\" then is not so much a genre as a cross-generic designation. A few bands refer to themselves as \\"symphonic metal,\\" particularly Aesma Daeva, and the term could probably be applied to generically ambiguous metal bands like Epica and Nightwish. =Symphonic black metal= Symphonic black metal has similar components as melodic black metal, but uses keyboarding or instruments normally found in symphonic or classical music. It can also include black metal bands that make heavy usage of atmospheric keyboarding in the music, akin to symphonic metal or gothic metal. The symphonic aspects of this genre are normally integral parts of a band, and as such are commonly used throughout the whole duration of a song. The prototypical symphonic black metal bands are Dimmu Borgir, Emperor and Carach Angren. =Symphonic power metal= Symphonic power metal refers to power metal bands that make extensive usage of keyboards, or instruments normally found in classical music, similar to symphonic metal. These additional elements are often used as key elements of the music when compared to regular power metal, contributing not only an extra layer to the music, but a greater variety of sound. Bands in this genre often feature clean vocals, with some bands adding relatively small quantities of screams or growls. The first prototypical symphonic power metal song was \\"Art of Life\\", a twenty-nine-minute song performed by Japanese heavy metal band X Japan in 1993. Finnish band Nightwish was another band that performed early symphonic power metal songs. Songs by Nightwish that illustrate the genre well are \\"Wishmaster\\" from the album Wishmaster, \\"Ghost Love Score\\" from the album Once, \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" on the album Dark Passion Play and \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\", a 24-minute song from the album Endless Forms Most Beautiful. These songs follow the epic scope and extended formal structures characteristic of power metal while making extensive use of orchestral elements. =Symphonic gothic metal= One of the first gothic metal bands to release a full album featuring \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" vocals, where death metal vocals are contrasted with clean female vocals, was the Norwegian Theatre of Tragedy in 1995. From then on after the departure of lead singer, Liv Kristine, in 2003, she and her future husband, Alexander Krull went on to form the symphonic metal band, Leaves' Eyes. The band is one of the pioneers of the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" vocal style scene. Other bands, such as the Dutch Within Temptation in 1996, expanded on this approach. A debut album Enter was unveiled in the following year, followed shortly by an EP The Dance. Both releases made use of the beauty and beast approach delivered by vocalists Sharon den Adel and Robert Westerholt. Their second full length Mother Earth was released in 2000 and dispensed entirely with the death metal vocals, instead \\"relying solely on den Adel's majestic vocal ability,\\" apart from one b-side track that did not make the final album release. The album was a commercial success with their lead single \\"Ice Queen\\" topping the charts in Belgium and their native Netherlands. Their third album The Silent Force arrived in 2004 as an \\"ambitious project featuring a full orchestra and 80-voice choir accompanying the band\\". The result was another commercial success across Europe and introduced \\"the world of heavy guitars and female vocals\\" to \\"a mainstream audience\\". Within Temptation's brand of gothic metal combines \\"the guitar-driven force of hard rock with the sweep and grandeur of symphonic music\\". The critic Chad Bowar of About.com describes their style as \\"the optimum balance\\" between \\"the melody and hooks of mainstream rock, the depth and complexity of classical music and the dark edge of gothic metal\\". The commercial success of Within Temptation has since resulted in the emergence of a large number of other female-fronted gothic metal bands, particularly in the Netherlands. Another Dutch band in the symphonic gothic metal strain is After Forever. Their debut album Prison of Desire in 2000 was \\"a courageous, albeit flawed first study into an admittedly daunting undertaking: to wed heavy metal with progressive rock arrangements and classical music orchestration - then top it all of with equal parts gruesome cookie-monster vocals and a fully qualified opera singer\\". Founding member, guitarist and vocalist Mark Jansen departed After Forever only a few months after the release of this album. Jansen would go on to form Epica, another Dutch band that performs a blend of gothic and symphonic metal. A debut album The Phantom Agony emerged in 2003 with music that combines Jansen's death grunts with the \\"angelic tones of a classically trained soprano, Simone Simons, over a lush foundation of symphonic power metal\\". The music of Epica has been described as combination of \\"a dark, haunting gothic atmosphere with bombastic and symphonic music\\". Like Within Temptation and After Forever, Epica has been known to make use of an orchestra. Their 2007 album The Divine Conspiracy was a chart success in their home country. This blend of symphonic and gothic metal has also been arrived at from the opposite direction. The band Nightwish from Finland began as a symphonic power metal act and introduced gothic elements on their 2004 album Once, particularly on the single \\"Nemo\\". They continued to mix their style of \\"bombastic, symphonic and cinematic\\" metal with a gothic atmosphere on their next album Dark Passion Play in 2007. The Swedish group Therion also introduced gothic elements to their brand of symphonic metal on their 2007 album Gothic Kabbalah. = Symphonic death metal = Bands described as symphonic death metal include Ex Deo, Septicflesh, Children of Bodom, MaYaN, and Fleshgod Apocalypse. Haggard's 2000 album, Awaking the Centuries, has been described as death metal-styled symphonic metal. Make Them Suffer is a band that mixes deathcore with symphonic/classical elements in their earlier material. Other bands that have mixed deathcore with symphonic metal include Winds of Plague and Betraying the Martyrs, the latter being known to \\"temper the punishing brutality of deathcore with melodic flourishes pulled from symphonic and progressive metal, giving it a theatricality that feels distinctly European.\\" See also * Avant-garde metal * List of symphonic metal bands * Melodic death metal * Neoclassical metal * Neoclassical dark wave * Power metal * Progressive metal References  External links  * Category:Fusion music genres Category:Heavy metal genres Category:Norwegian styles of music ","title":"Symphonic metal"},{"id":"1145374","text":"A snubber is a device used to suppress (\\"snub\\") a phenomenon such as voltage transients in electrical systems, pressure transients in fluid systems (caused by for example water hammer) or excess force or rapid movement in mechanical systems. Electrical systems Snubbers are frequently used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow leads to a sharp rise in voltage across the current switching device (\\"inductive kick\\"), in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can be a source of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the current switching device so that the inductive element may be safely discharged. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While current switching is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to prevent arcing across the contacts of relays and switches, or the electrical interference, or the welding of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression). =RC snubbers= RC snubber schematic RC snubbers Schematic of a flyback converter with an RCD snubber A simple RC snubber uses a small resistor (R) in series with a small capacitor (C). This combination can be used to suppress the rapid rise in voltage across a thyristor, preventing the erroneous turn-on of the thyristor; it does this by limiting the rate of rise in voltage (dV/dt) across the thyristor to a value which will not trigger it. An appropriately-designed RC snubber can be used with either DC or AC loads. This sort of snubber is commonly used with inductive loads such as electric motors. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so a decreasing transient current will flow through it for a small fraction of a second, allowing the voltage across the switch to increase more slowly when the switch is opened. Determination of voltage rating can be difficult owing to the nature of transient waveforms, and may be defined simply by the power rating of the snubber components and the application. RC snubbers can be made discretely and are also built as a single component (see also Boucherot cell). =Diode snubbers= When the current flowing is DC, a simple rectifier diode is often employed as a snubber.; diode protects transistor driver from overvoltage. The snubber diode is wired in parallel with an inductive load (such as a relay coil or electric motor). The diode is installed so that it does not conduct under normal conditions. When the external driving current is interrupted, the inductor current flows instead through the diode. The stored energy of the inductor is then gradually dissipated by the diode voltage drop and the resistance of the inductor itself. One disadvantage of using a simple rectifier diode as a snubber is that the diode allows current to continue flowing for some time, causing the inductor to remain active for slightly longer than desired. When such a snubber is utilized in a relay, this effect may cause a significant delay in the drop out, or disengagement, of the actuator. The diode must immediately enter into forward conduction mode as the driving current is interrupted. Most ordinary diodes, even \\"slow\\" power silicon diodes, are able to turn on very quickly,cliftonlaboratories.com in contrast to their slow reverse recovery time. These are sufficient for snubbing electromechanical devices such as relays and motors. In high-speed cases, where the switching is faster than 10 nanoseconds, such as in certain switching power regulators, \\"fast\\", \\"ultrafast\\", or Schottky diodes may be required.cds.linear.com =RCD snubbers= More sophisticated designs use a diode with an RC network.: \\"The R–C–D network provides optimum contact protection, but it is more expensive than other methods and cannot be used in an ac circuit.\\" =More sophisticated solid-state snubbers= In some DC circuits, a varistor or two inverse-series Zener diodes (collectively called a Transil or Transorb) may be used instead of the simple diode. Because these devices dissipate significant power, the relay may drop-out faster than it would with a simple rectifier diode. An advantage to using a transorb over just one diode is that it will protect against over voltage with both polarities, if connected to ground, forcing the voltage to stay between the confines of the breakdown voltages of the Zener diodes. A Zener diode connected to ground will protect against positive transients that go over the Zener's breakdown voltage, and will protect against negative transients greater than a normal forward diode drop. In AC circuits a rectifier diode snubber cannot be used; if a simple RC snubber is not adequate a more complex bidirectional snubber design must be used. Mechanical and hydraulic systems Snubbers for pipes and equipment are used to control movement during abnormal conditions such as earthquakes, turbine trips, safety valve closure, relief valve closure, or hydraulic fuse closure. Snubbers allow for free thermal movement of a component during regular conditions, but restrain the component in irregular conditions.Hydraulic & Mechanical Snubbers Piping Technology & Products, (retrieved February 2012 A hydraulic snubber allows for pipe deflection under normal operating conditions.

The city owes its name to the rock reef ('Arrecife' is Spanish for 'reef') which covers the beach located in the city. The city also gives its name to the nearby Arrecife Airport. The population of the municipality is (2018), its area is . It is south of Teguise, east of San Bartolomé and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to its southeast. Arrecife is a port town on the east coast, served by ferries to the other islands and also Europe and mainland Africa. The LZ1 road connects Arrecife to the northeast of the island, the LZ2 road connects the capital to the island's southwest, and the LZ3 road serves as the city's beltway. The tallest building in Lanzarote is the Arrecife Gran Hotel, which is located on the seafront alongside the harbour.  History  The earliest records of Arrecife date from the fifteenth century when it was a small fishing settlement. The name, given then as Arrecifes, refers to the black volcanic reefs behind which boats could hide, protected from sudden pirate attacks. Towards the end of the sixteenth century the settlement began to grow in response to a need for accommodation and warehousing to support growing trade between the old and new worlds. The first church was constructed at this time, consecrated to the first bishop of Arrecife, San Ginés. Growing prosperity increased the attractiveness of the town as a pirate target: in 1571 a notorious pirate named Dogan plundered and almost completely destroyed the little port town. In 1964 Arrecife became the site of Lanzarote's first sea-water desalination plant, which was still operational in 2010.

His plays include Salvation Nell (1908) and Romance (1913), which was made into a motion picture with Greta Garbo. After becoming ill at age 29 with crippling rheumatoid arthritis, which eventually claimed his sight (around 1930), Sheldon became a source of emotional and creative support for his many friends, including such luminaries of the literary and theatrical world as Minnie Maddern Fiske (he wrote Salvation Nell for her), Julia Marlowe, John Barrymore (his closest friend and confidante), Thornton Wilder, Alexander Woollcott, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Ruth Gordon, Helen Hayes and many others. While in hospital his advice was received by those in the theatrical profession as gospel. In May 1915 Sheldon narrowly missed sailing on the Lusitania's infamous last voyage. He had been asked by theater impresario Charles Frohman to accompany him to England. A Harvard classmate of Sheldon's was getting married on May 11 and asked Sheldon to be best man. Sheldon then declined Frohman's offer. A 1936 lawsuit against Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer for copyright infringement claimed that the script MGM used for the 1932 motion picture Letty Lynton plagiarized material from the play Dishonored Lady by Sheldon and Margaret Ayer Barnes. The film is still unavailable today because of this lawsuit. His life is detailed in The Man Who Lived Twice by Eric Wollencott Barnes. In this biography Barnes states that Sheldon was in love all his adult life with Doris Keane, the actress who starred in Romance in 1913.

He previously played in the Football League and Premier League for Arsenal, Crystal Palace, Cardiff City, Birmingham City, Coventry City, Fulham, Barnsley and Walsall, and in Cyprus for Nea Salamis Famagusta. Club career Gray was born in Lewisham, in south London. He began his association with Arsenal as a nine-year-old, and made one substitute for the first team before making a switch across London in July 2000 to join Crystal Palace for a £500,000 fee. He is an attacking left winger who can also play as an auxiliary striker, and has learnt full-back duties so he can help out in defence. Gray played a key part in helping them achieve promotion in the 2003–04 season, despite missing the play-off final through suspension. In addition to his successes during that season he spent a two- month spell on loan with Cardiff City. One of Gray's most memorable games for Palace was when he scored in a man-of-the-match performance as Palace surprisingly knocked Liverpool out of the 2002–03 FA Cup at Anfield. Gray with Birmingham City in 2004 Gray's contract expired in June 2004, allowing him to sign for Birmingham City on a free transfer. He made 32 Premier League appearances in his first season in the Midlands, and remained a key part of manager Steve Bruce's plans during the 2005–06 season, although an ankle injury kept him out for several weeks towards the end of the campaign, but started only twice as the team returned to the Premier League in 2007 and was released at the end of that season. He joined Coventry City on 10 July 2007. He signed for Fulham on a season-long loan on 1 September 2008, and despite not playing a single league game for the club, the move was made permanent for an undisclosed fee on 2 February 2009. He made only one substitute appearance for Fulham, and was released at the end of the season. In July 2009 Gray went on Sheffield United's pre-season tour of Malta as part of a trial with the club, and the following month he had a trial with former club Cardiff City. Gray signed for Barnsley on 15 September, initially on a monthly contract. He was released after two months, during which he made seven appearances in all competitions and started only one Championship game. Gray joined Walsall in February 2010, and was offered a new deal by the club at the end of the season. He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in the 2–1 victory over Brentford with a volley from a Darren Byfield cross. After leaving Walsall when his contract expired, Gray spent two seasons in Cyprus with Nea Salamis Famagusta. He returned to England in 2013, and trained with Walsall before signing a contract with them on 27 September, to run until January of the following year. Gray made his second debut for the club on 12 October, as a 71st-minute substitute for James Baxendale in a 1–1 draw away at Colchester United. He was released when his contract expired.

Also called lead zirconium titanate, it is a ceramic perovskite material that shows a marked piezoelectric effect, meaning that the compound changes shape when an electric field is applied. It is used in a number of practical applications such as ultrasonic transducers and piezoelectric resonators. It is a white to off-white solid. Lead zirconium titanate was first developed around 1952 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Compared to barium titanate, a previously discovered metallic oxide-based piezoelectric material, Lead zirconium titanate exhibits greater sensitivity and has a higher operating temperature. Due to its physical strength, chemical inertness, tailorability, and relatively low manufacture costs, it is one of the most commonly used piezo ceramics. Electroceramic properties Being piezoelectric, Lead zirconate titanate develops a voltage (or potential difference) across two of its faces when compressed (useful for sensor applications), and physically changes shape when an external electric field is applied (useful for actuator applications). The relative permittivity of Lead zirconate titanate can range from 300 to 20000, depending upon orientation and doping. Being pyroelectric, this material develops a voltage difference across two of its faces under changing temperature conditions; consequently, Lead zirconate titanate can be used as a heat sensor. Lead zirconate titanate is also ferroelectric, which means that it has a spontaneous electric polarization (electric dipole) that can be reversed in the presence of an electric field. The material features an extremely large relative permittivity at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) near x = 0.52. Some formulations are ohmic until at least 250 kV/cm (25 MV/m), after which current grows exponentially with field strength before reaching avalanche breakdown; but Lead zirconate titanate exhibits time-dependent dielectric breakdown — breakdown may occur under constant-voltage stress after minutes or hours, depending on voltage and temperature, so its dielectric strength depends on the time scale over which it is measured. Other formulations have dielectric strengths measured in the 8–16 MV/m range. Uses Lead zirconate titanate ultrasound transducer Lead zirconate titanate-based materials are components of ultrasound transducers and ceramic capacitors, STM/AFM actuators (tubes). Lead zirconate titanate is used to make ultrasound transducers and other sensors and actuators, as well as high-value ceramic capacitors and FRAM chips. Lead zirconate titanate is also used in the manufacture of ceramic resonators for reference timing in electronic circuitry. In 1975 Sandia National Laboratories created anti-flash goggles featuring PZLT to protect aircrew from burns and blindness in case of a nuclear explosion. The PLZT lenses could turn opaque in less than 150 microseconds. Commercially, it is usually not used in its pure form, rather it is doped with either acceptors, which create oxygen (anion) vacancies, or donors, which create metal (cation) vacancies and facilitate domain wall motion in the material. In general, acceptor doping creates hard Lead zirconate titanate, while donor doping creates soft Lead zirconate titanate. Hard and soft Lead zirconate titanate generally differ in their piezoelectric constants. Piezoelectric constants are proportional to the polarization or to the electrical field generated per unit of mechanical stress, or alternatively is the mechanical strain produced by per unit of electric field applied. In general, soft Lead zirconate titanate has a higher piezoelectric constant, but larger losses in the material due to internal friction. In hard Lead zirconate titanate, domain wall motion is pinned by the impurities, thereby lowering the losses in the material, but at the expense of a reduced piezoelectric constant. Varieties One of the commonly studied chemical composition is Pb. The increased piezoelectric response and poling efficiency near to x = 0.52 is due to the increased number of allowable domain states at the MPB. At this boundary, the 6 possible domain states from the tetragonal phase ⟨100⟩ and the 8 possible domain states from the rhombohedral phase ⟨111⟩ are equally favorable energetically, thereby allowing a maximum 14 possible domain states. Like structurally similar lead scandium tantalate and barium strontium titanate, lead zirconate titanate can be used for manufacture of uncooled staring array infrared imaging sensors for thermographic cameras. Both thin film (usually obtained by chemical vapor deposition) and bulk structures are used. The formula of the material used usually approaches Pb1.1(Zr0.3Ti0.7)O3 (called lead zirconate titanate 30/70). Its properties may be modified by doping it with lanthanum, resulting in lanthanum-doped lead zirconium titanate (lead zirconate titanate, also called lead lanthanum zirconium titanate), with formula Pb0.83La0.17(Zr0.3Ti0.7)0.9575O3 (Lead zirconate titanate 17/30/70).

A. A. Ketelaar) are triangles used for showing different compounds in varying degrees of ionic, metallic and covalent bonding.[1]  History  In 1941 van Arkel recognised three extreme materials and associated bonding types. Using 36 main group elements, such as metals, metalloids and non-metals, he placed ionic, metallic and covalent bonds on the corners of an equilateral triangle, as well as suggested intermediate species. The bond triangle shows that chemical bonds are not just particular bonds of a specific type. Rather, bond types are interconnected and different compounds have varying degrees of different bonding character (for example, covalent bonds with significant ionic character are called polar covalent bonds). Six years later (in 1947) Ketelaar developed van Arkel’s idea by adding more compounds and placing bonds on different sides of the triangle. Many people developed the triangle idea. Some (e.g. Allen’s quantitative triangle) used electron configuration energy as an atom parameter, others (Jensen’s quantitative triangle, Norman’s quantitative triangle) used electronegativity of compounds. Nowadays, electronegativity triangles are mostly used to rate the chemical bond type.  Usage  Different compounds that obey the octet rule (sp-elements) and hydrogen can be placed on the triangle. Unfortunately, d-elements cannot be analysed using van Arkel- Ketelaar triangle, as their electronegativity is so high that it is taken as a constant. Using electronegativity - two compound average electronegativity on x-axis and electronegativity difference on y-axis, we can rate the dominant bond between the compounds. Example is here On the right side (from ionic to covalent) should be compounds with varying difference in electronegativity. The compounds with equal electronegativity, such as Cl2 (chlorine) are placed in the covalent corner , while the ionic corner has compounds with large electronegativity difference, such as NaCl (table salt). The bottom side (from metallic to covalent) contains compounds with varying degree of directionality in the bond. At one extreme is metallic bonds with delocalized bonding and the other are covalent bonds in which the orbitals overlap in a particular direction. The left side (from ionic to metallic) is meant for delocalized bonds with varying electronegativity difference.

Valentin Adamberger, also known by his Italian name Adamonti, (22 February 1740 or 6 July 174324 August 1804) was a German operatic tenor. His voice was universally admired for its pliancy, agility, and precision, and several composers of note, such as Mozart, wrote music specifically for him. Biography Adamberger was born either in Rohr, Bavaria in 1740 or in Munich in 1743. Beginning in 1755, he studied singing with Johann Walleshauser (also known as Giovanni Valesi) while at the ', a Jesuit institution in Munich. In 1760, he joined the Kapelle of Duke Clemens and upon the Duke's death in 1770 was taken into the Elector's Hofkapelle. He made his opera début at Munich in 1772. This was the beginning of a successful career singing leading tenor roles in opera seria at Modena, Venice, Florence, Pisa and Rome. He created roles in operas by J. C. Bach, Giuseppe Sarti, Pietro Guglielmi, Antonio Sacchini, Ferdinando Bertoni and others. The arias they wrote for his voice tended to be moderate in tempo and often were written in B major. Many of the composers orchestrated his arias with obbligato clarinets and expressive chromatic inflections. In Rome, Adamberger sang under the italianized stage name Valentino Adamonti from 1775 to 1777. From 1778-1779 he sang at the King's Theatre in London. After returning to Italy briefly for appearances in Florence and Milan, he joined the Singspiel company of the National Court Theater at Vienna. He made his début there on 21 August 1780. The following year, he married the Viennese actress Maria Anna Adamberger (1753–1804); their daughter was Antonie Adamberger, later a popular actress. In 1783, the Singspiel company disbanded but Adamberger was kept on for the Italian company that replaced it. When the Singspiel company was revived in 1785, alongside the Italian, he again became its leading tenor, and when it was disbanded for the second time, in 1789, he returned to the Italian company. In 1793, he retired from the stage but continued as a member of the imperial Hofkapelle and as an eminent singing teacher. He died in Vienna. Although Adamberger's voice was admired where ever he went, he did have his critics. Christian Schubart and Mount Edgcumbe remarked on the nasal quality of his voice in the higher vocal register and Charles Burney, generally a harsh critic of singers, remarked that \\"with a better voice [he] would have been a good singer\\". However, he was universally liked by the public in Italy, Germany, and England, and was a particularly popular singer in Vienna. Michtner, a local Viennese journalist, wrote of Adamberger that he was \\"the favourite singer of softer hearts\\". Mozart, who admired Adamberger, wrote the part of Belmonte in Die Entführung aus dem Serail (1782) for him. In a letter dated 26 September 1781, Mozart wrote, \\"Let me now turn to Belmonte's aria in A major, ‘O wie ängstlich, o wie feurig’. Would you like to know how I have expressed it – and even indicated his throbbing heart? By the two violins playing in octaves. This is the favourite aria of all who have heard it, and it is mine also. I wrote it expressly to suit Adamberger's voice. You see the trembling, the faltering, you see how his throbbing breast begins to swell; this I have expressed by a crescendo. You hear the whispering and the sighing – which I have indicated by the first violins with mutes and a flute playing in unison.\\" Mozart also composed the role of Vogelsang in Der Schauspieldirektor (1786) for Adamberger, as well as several concert arias (K.420 and K.431) and the cantata Die MaurerfreudeDie Maurerfreude on Klassica (K.471).

An InterCity 225 passenger train operated by Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) travelling from Newcastle to London collided with a Land Rover Defender which had crashed down a motorway embankment onto the railway line. It was consequently derailed into the path of an oncoming freight train at an estimated closing speed of . Ten people died including the drivers of both trains, and 82 were seriously injured. It remains the worst rail disaster of the 21st century in the United Kingdom. Events The Selby rail crash occurred at approximately 06:13 (GMT), when a Land Rover Defender, driven by Gary Neil Hart and towing a loaded trailer (carrying a Renault Savanna estate car), left the carriageway of the westbound M62 motorway just before a bridge over the East Coast Main Line. The vehicle ran down an embankment and onto the southbound railway track. Hart tried to reverse it off the track but could not. He exited the vehicle and, while he was using a mobile telephone to contact emergency services, the Land Rover was hit by a southbound Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) InterCity 225 heading from Newcastle to London King's Cross. The InterCity 225 was propelled by a Class 91 locomotive (No.91023) and led by Driving Van Trailer (DVT) No. 82221. After striking the Land Rover, the leading bogie of the DVT derailed but the train stayed upright. Points to nearby sidings then deflected it into the path of an oncoming Freightliner freight train carrying coal and travelling from Immingham to Ferrybridge, hauled by a Class 66 locomotive (No.66521). The freight train hit the wreckage approximately from the passenger train's impact with the Land Rover. The impact resulted in the near destruction of the lightweight DVT and severe to moderate damage to all nine of the InterCity 225's Mark 4 coaches, which mostly overturned and came to rest down an embankment to the east side of the track, in a field adjacent to the railway line just south of overbridge ECM 2/7. The trailing locomotive remained upright and suffered minor damage, although it was derailed. The Class 66 lost its bogies after impact, with debris of the DVT jammed underneath rupturing its fuel tank. The freight locomotive then overturned onto its left side coming to rest in the garden of a residence adjacent to the line to the north of the same bridge. The locomotive sustained major damage to its cab area and right side. The first nine wagons following it were also derailed and damaged to varying extents. Immediately before the impact of the two trains, the speed of the InterCity 225 was estimated as and that of the freight train as . With an estimated closing speed of , the collision between the trains was the highest-speed railway incident that had occurred in the UK since the 1999 Ladbroke Grove crash. Outcome Both train drivers, two additional train crew on board the InterCity 225, and six passengers were killed, all as a result of the second collision.\\"Selby rail crash car driver Gary Hart blames 'fate'\\", BBC News, 28 February 2011. Retrieved 16 July 2014 Survivors of the accident included a train-driving instructor, Andrew Hill, who was travelling in the cab of 66521 and teaching a new route to the driver of the Class 66, a driver with 24 years of experience. Among those killed were: * John Weddle, from Throckley – GNER driver * Stephen (George) Dunn, from Brayton – Freightliner driver * Raymond Robson, from Whitley Bay – GNER train guard * Paul Taylor, from Newcastle – GNER chef The coaches of the InterCity 225 were carrying 99 passengers and train staff. The early morning 04:45 time departure from Newcastle resulted in reduced passenger numbers. As it was, 45 of the 52 seriously injured passengers, and all eight fatalities (excluding the two locomotive drivers) were travelling in the first five coaches, which included a restaurant car and two first class coaches with less densely packed seating than standard coaches. In total 82 survivors were taken to hospital. The official incident report praised the crashworthiness of the InterCity 225's Mark 4 coaches. An unusual aspect of the emergency response was the need to carry out disinfecting procedures at the scene because of the 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis. Aftermath A memorial to the Great Heck rail disaster Locomotive No. 66526 has since been named \\"Driver Steve Dunn (George)\\", in memory of the Freightliner driver killed in the accident. It carries a plaque commemorating the accident: \\"In remembrance of a dedicated engineman Driver Steve (George) Dunn was tragically killed in the accident at Great Heck on 28th February 2001\\". Dunn's son James, who was nine at the time of the crash, later became a train driver. Barry Needham, another Freightliner employee killed in the crash, was also commemorated by the naming of 60087 after him, the plates later being transferred to 60091. This locomotive also carries an explanatory plaque. John Weddle, the GNER driver killed in the accident, was honoured by way of a new driver-training school in his home city of Newcastle, which was named after him. In a ceremony attended by members of his family, his 16-year- old daughter Stephanie unveiled a plaque dedicating the school to his memory. Coincidentally, No. 91023 was also involved in the Hatfield rail crash four months earlier. The locomotive escaped with only slight damage on both occasions. Following technical upgrade of the Class 91 fleet, which led to all locomotives having 100 added to the number (91001 became 91101, etc.), 91023 was renumbered 91132, not 91123. Legal proceedings Hart escaped the incident unscathed and was later tried on ten counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He denied the charges, claiming that his car had suffered a mechanical fault or had collided with an object on the road. An investigation, including reconstruction of the Land Rover to demonstrate that it was not mechanically defective, concluded that Hart had been driving in a sleep- deprived condition, and had not applied the brakes as it went down the embankment. It later transpired that Hart had stayed up the previous night talking on the telephone to a woman he had met through an internet dating agency. Hart later stated that although he had witnessed the impact between the InterCity 225 and his Land Rover, he had not been aware of the more serious collision with the freight train until informed by police several hours later. He was found guilty on 13 December 2001, and was sentenced to five years in prison and a five-year driving ban. He was released from prison in July 2004 after serving half of his sentence. Campaigners drew attention to what they claimed was the inadequate length of the crash barriers alongside the motorway. According to the Health and Safety Executive's final report, the Land Rover had left the road 30 yards before the barrier started and had easily broken through the simple wooden fence that lined the track. A 2003 Highways Agency review of crash barriers on bridges over railways concluded that only three bridges nationwide were in need of upgrading. The bridge at Great Heck was not one of them. By October 2003 Hart's insurers had paid out over £22 million. Gary Hart's insurers, through Hart's name, sued the Department for Transport for a contribution to the damages paid to GNER and the victims, alleging a degree of causation on the grounds that the safety barrier was inadequate (contributory negligence). The High Court judge ruled that the barrier length had been reasonable and there was no negligence.

Trade union activities Wilson rose to prominence in the late 1880s, on the back of the success of his union and his involvement in various strikes, including the London dock strike of 1889. Wilson's union suffered in the early 1890s and almost collapsed in 1894. Its revival came in 1911, with the outbreak of a wave of seamen's and dockers' strikes in British ports. Despite his militant tactics, Wilson was a relative moderate whose goal was to establish friendly relations with shipowners and formal conciliation procedures in the shipping industry to enable disputes to be resolved without recourse to strikes or lockouts. This goal was steadily achieved after shipowners recognised the union in 1911 and began working closely with officials during the First World War. After 1917, wage rates and conditions were set by the National Maritime Board, which represented the Shipping Federation and Wilson's union. In the 1920s, Wilson's reputation as a 'bosses' man' made him increasingly unpopular in the wider labour movement. Political career Wilson's first electoral contest was at a by-election in Bristol East in 1890, at which he did poorly. He won his second contest, at Middlesbrough in 1892, in which he stood as an independent labour candidate in opposition to a Gladstonian Liberal, and a Liberal Unionist . Having secured election, however, Wilson moved quickly to align himself with the Liberal Party and existing Lib–Lab Members of Parliament (MPs) such as Thomas Burt and John Wilson. Wilson continued to align himself with the Liberal Party in politics despite the establishment and growth of the Labour Party. Indeed, he was fiercely critical of the Labour Party and of key figures within it such as Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald. He retained his Middlesbrough seat in the 1895 general election but narrowly lost to Samuel Alexander Sadler, a Conservative, in the 1900 election – an election characterised by a considerable swing towards the Conservatives. He won Middlesbrough for a third and final time at the 1906 election. He did not stand in 1910. He was a founder of the National Democratic Party but stood as a Liberal at the October 1918 by-election in South Shields, when he was elected unopposed. He held the seat as a Coalition Liberal at the 1918 general election. His last electoral contest came at the 1922 general election, when he stood as a National Liberal candidate, but lost his seat – coming third with only 20.5% of the vote. Wilson was noted as one of the most vociferous supporters of Britain's involvement in the First World War. Havelock was buried in Hendon Park Cemetery, with many dockers in attendance having walked to the graveside from Docklands.

They currently play in the and are nicknamed \\"The Chats\\". Former Premier League club Portsmouth and current Premier League club West Ham United played their first ever league matches against Chatham. History The club was formed in 1882 as Chatham United, when Rochester Invicta merged with the Royal Engineers Band football team.Club History Chatham Town Chatham played their home games at the Army owned pitches called \\"The Lines\\", where they were to remain until 1889 when they moved to the Maidstone Road Ground.Chatham Town FC Pyramid Passion – Chatham Town FC The move to the new ground was prompted when the club reached the quarter-finals of the FA cup in 1888–89, and admission fees could not be charged at \\"The Lines\\" because of Army regulations. This cup run was also instrumental in the Football Associations ruling that all future matches in the competition must be played on fully enclosed grounds, where the visiting club would receive a share of the gate money. So the club moved to the Maidstone Road site which was owned by a George Winch, who allowed the club to enclose the ground and build a pavilion with seats in front for £125. In 1894 Chatham became founder members of both the Southern League and the original Kent League, winning the Kent League in its inaugural season. For the first two seasons the club competed in both leagues, but left the Kent league to concentrate on the Southern league in 1896.FCHD Football Club History Database In the 1900–01 season, owing to financial difficulties, Chatham resigned from the Southern League. They played as Chatham Amateurs in 1901 for a season and rejoined the Kent league, where two seasons later in 1903/04, they won the Kent league and repeated the same feat the following season, as well as winning the Kent Senior Cup. After The First World War, Chatham returned to play and in the 1919 season won the Kent Victory Cup and the Chatham Charity Cup. They rejoined the Southern League in 1920–21, but withdrew at the end of the season because of the burden of travel costs on club finances. In 1927–28 they rejoined the Southern League for two seasons. Again, the expenses to play proved a financial strain on the club, and returned to the Kent League. The club struggled financially and for the 1933–34 season the club took a voluntary relegation into Division Two of the Kent League. A season later they won the division but decided against promotion, and reverted to Amateur status. Having played in both the Kent League and Kent Amateur League in 1938–39, they decided to limit play to amateur competition the following season, however this was interrupted by WWII. After the War Chatham won the Kent Amateur League Premier Division in 1946–47, which was to be their last honour under that name. On 7 January 1947 they merged with Shorts F.C., with the amalgamated club taking the name Chatham Town at the request of the local council. They then joined Division One of the Kent League for the 1947–48 season and stayed there until 1959, when the Kent league disbanded. For the 1959–60 season they joined as a founding member of the Aetolian League. The following year they captured the League Championship and the Aetolian League Cup Final. In 1964–65 the Aetolian League merged with the London League and the club moved to the Metropolitan League. Four Seasons later they returned to the Kent League when it was reformed in 1968. They remained in the Kent league until 1983, when they joined the Southern League. During the 15-year period in the Kent league they won League 4 times and won League and Cup double in both 1971–72 and 1977–78. The club changed its name in 1974 for 5 years to Medway F.C.,FCHD Football Club History Database – Medway at the request of the local council, returning to Chatham Town in 1979. The club stayed in the Southern League until 1988, when having failed to gain re-election they were relegated to the Kent League; there were financial troubles. They experienced crowds, as had other poorly supported clubs, in double figures; Kent League days had healthier attendance with more local competition. Upon returning to the Kent League, the club struggled, until former player John Adams became First Team manager. He guided the club to the Third Qualifying Round of the F.A. Cup in 1993–94, the Final of the Kent Senior Trophy in 1995–96 and finished among the top three of the Kent League for three successive seasons. However he was dismissed by the club following a bad start to the 1996–97 season. In 1997 the club was forced to briefly return to Great Lines when a new drainage system saw parts of the Maidstone Road pitch collapse. The Kent League allowed them to use the Garrison Ground in Kings Bastian for several matches, before they could arrange a brief ground-share with Gillingham at Priestfield Stadium. The club returned home for the 1998–99 season under new manager Carl Laraman, with results improving immediately; however he left in January of that year to take up a coaching position at Charlton Athletic. His assistant, Steve Hearn, was appointed player-manager and saw the club become Kent League Champions and promoted to the Southern League, in 2000–01. At the end of the first season in the league Steve Hearn resigned due to poor results and was replaced by his assistant Peter Coupland. However Peter Coupland only lasted until the middle of the 2003–04 season (with the club looking likely to be relegated) with Clive Walker replacing him, and steering the club to a mid table finish. The league was restructured for the 2004–05 season and saw Chatham being placed in the Southern League Eastern Division. During this campaign Clive Walker return to his old club Dover Athletic and his assistant Steve Binks was appointed manager. Since that season the club has moved between the Isthmian League North and South Divisions with regular mid table positions. For the 2006–07 season the club saw former player Phil Miles take over as Manager; however this lasted until December that season when he had to stand down due to work commitments with Steve Binks taking over the job again. During this season the club achieved the FA charter Standard award. Between the seasons 2006–07 and 2007–08 the club played in Isthmian League Division 1 South. The club played in Isthmian League Division 1 North in the season 2008–09, but transferred the following season to Division 1 South. The Season 2010–11 saw a management change with Paul Foley and his assistant Mark Newson move from VCD Athletic. In this season, the club played in Isthmian League Division 1 South finishing 21st, a relegation place. However, the club was reprieved from relegation and instead were transferred for the next season to Isthmian League Division 1 North. The management team of Foley and Newson lasted until the end of that season when Player Manager Kevin Watson took over at first in a caretaker role and then as Manager for the 2011–12 season.Kevin Watson Kevin Watson profile – Chatham Town FC website Between the seasons 2011–12 and 2014–15, the club played without notable success in Isthmian League Division 1 North. From the start of season 2015–16, the club has played in Isthmian League Division 1 South. Darren Anslow is now first team manager. He was appointed at the beginning of October 2016. He holds a UEFA 'A' Licence and has extensive experience at a number of non league clubs in the south east .

The two Sunnah rak'ah following the Isha' are highly recommended and so is the three rakat Witr. There are a few optional prayers that can be recited after the Isha' prayer, including the Nafilat ul-Layl prayers (together termed tahajjud), as well as the tarawih in Ramadan. The five daily prayers collectively are one pillar of the Five Pillars of Islam, in Sunni Islam, and one of the ten Practices of the Religion (Furū al-Dīn) according to Shia Islam. Ahadith mentioning virtues An Imam reads verses from the Quran after Isha' (night prayers) in the Mughal Empire. Uthman reported that he heard Muhammad saying: \\"The one who offered Isha salat in congregation, it was as if he remained in salat up to midnight, and he who offered the Fajr salat in congregation, it was as if he remained in salat the whole night.\\" (Muslim) Abu Hurairah reported: The Messenger of Allah said, \\"The most difficult Salah for the munafiqeen (the hypocrites) is Isha and Fajr. Had they known the rewards for them, they would have attended them even if they had to crawl on their knees.\\" (Bukhari) Sunni Muslims The time period within which the Isha prayer must be recited is the following: *Time begins: According to the Hanafi school, Isha begins when complete darkness has arrived and the white twilight in the sky has disappeared. According to the Maliki and Shafi'i schools, the time begins when the red thread has disappeared from the sky. These times can be approximated by using the sun as a measure. When the sun has descended 12 degrees below the horizon, it is approximately equivalent to the disappearance of the red from the sky. For approximating when complete darkness begins, some astronomers argue that it occurs when the sun has descended 15 degrees below the horizon while others use the safer measure of 18 degrees. *Time ends: At the beginning of dawn when the time for Fajr prayer begins. However, it is frowned upon to delay the prayer without a legitimate reason past the first third of the night, and \\"night\\" in Islamic law means the time between the end of the Maghrib prayer and the start of the Fajr prayer. According to an opinion in the Maliki school, the prohibition is from delaying the prayer beyond the first half of the night, rather than just the first third.Prayer Times defined for all five prayers in a day, qul.org website, Retrieved 14 May 2017 Shia Muslims The time period within which the Isha prayer must be recited is the following: *Time begins: once Maghrib (evening prayer) has been recited and completed. *Time ends: at midnight, the midpoint between shafak and dawn.

A painter and widely published magazine illustrator, he gained prominence for his architectural work such as in the 1906, Plan for Chicago, and for the large murals he painted in many well-known public structures such as the Lincoln Memorial. Biography Jules Vallée Guérin was born in St Louis, Missouri on November 18, 1866 and his family moved to Chicago in 1880. As a teenager, he was employed as a painter in a Chicago theatrical scenery firm. By 1889 he is known to have shared a studio with Winsor McCay, the noted cartoonist. They influenced each other in their use of daring points of view. In 1893 Guerin made a painting of one of the buildings at the Chicago World's Fair. His only confirmed art instruction occurred in Chicago, Jules attended evening life drawing classes for two years from 1892 to 1894 at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago The registration records of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/5181/saic-second-alumni-association- retrospective page 13, though biographies claim that he studied in Paris. Though of French Huguenot descent, he is not likely to have spoken French fluently as a child. Nothing in his style or method indicates a Beaux Arts education. In 1900 he established a studio in New York, where he made his name as an architectural delineator and illustrator. His first major break occurred when he was hired by Charles Follen McKim to create some illustrations for the Senate Parks Commission (McMillan Plan) for Washington. These were exhibited and published in 1902. Architects began hiring Guérin to make similar, dramatic renderings of their buildings. He worked mainly in watercolor, gouache, and tempera, usually on colored board. His fame as a colorist soon spread, and he took on more work as a magazine illustrator and sold lithographs. Guérin was a frequent contributor to Scribner's Magazine and Century Magazine during the first decade of the Twentieth Century.Mark Alan Hewitt, Guerin, Jules, American National Biography, Oxford Univ. Press, 1999 As a result of his success in Washington, Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett hired Guérin to make perspective illustrations for their monumental work, The Plan of Chicago in 1907. The spectacular color views of the proposed city, many from a bird's eye perspective, are his most famous works. The majority of these original renderings—by Guérin and other artists—are in the collection of the Department of Architecture at The Art Institute of Chicago, while others are currently owned by the Chicago Historical Society. Painting by Guerin for Daniel Burnham's Plan of Chicago, 1909 335px In 1912, when the architect Henry Bacon was competing with John Russell Pope to win the commission for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., he hired Guérin to create renderings of alternative designs. The paintings, still in the National Archives, were likely influential in Bacon's triumph. After he received the commission, Bacon retained Guerin to paint two large murals, Reunion and Emancipation, that decorate the cella of the memorial above the Gettysburg and Second Inaugural Addresses. They were recently cleaned, revealing a subtle color palette that complements Daniel Chester French’s Seated Lincoln statue.Mark Alan Hewitt, Jules Guerin: Master Delineator, Rice University, 1983 In 1916 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1931. As an adjunct to his work as an illustrator, Guérin took an active part in the international expositions of his day, showing at the Pan American Expo in Buffalo, New York, 1901, the Louisiana Purchase Expo held in St Louis in 1904 at which he won a silver medal, and the Lewis & Clark Expo in Portland, Oregon in 1905. He published illustrations of these fairs in popular magazines of the day. In 1915, Guérin was asked by Edward Bennett to serve as Director of Color at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Unlike previous fairs, this west coast effort used a palette of Mediterranean colors to accent the buildings to take advantage of the local climate and flora. It is likely that connections that he made there led to his one-man show at the University of California, Berkeley two years later, followed by several large murals in the old Federal Reserve Bank Building of San Francisco. Probably because of his early Chicago based background, Guérin was a frequent collaborator with the Chicago architectural firm (and the successor firm to Daniel Burnham’s practice) Graham, Anderson, Probst & White. Most notable of these commissions was the dramatic fire curtain for the theatre in GAPW's Chicago Civic Opera Building in 1929. Guérin's work as a book illustrator came as a result of magazine commissions. Articles in The Century by Maria Hornor Lansdale resulted in her 1906 travel book, The Chateaux of Touraine, which supplements its many photographs with Guérin's paintings. From 1909 to 1911 the painter traveled with Robert Hichens to create similar illustrations for his popular books on Egypt, the Holy Land, and the Near East. The superb color lithography in these books, as well as two he published with Maxfield Parish, has made them highly collectible today. Despite his wish to be regarded as a major serious artist, Jules Guérin is most highly regarded as an illustrator and architectural delineator. Indeed, he stands tall among a distinguished group of American artists who brought to life the scenes and buildings of the Progressive Era in the emerging print media of the early Twentieth Century.

It is based on the life of Mariana de Pineda Muñoz, whose opposition to Ferdinand VII (and subsequent public execution in 1831 for treason), had become part of the folklore of Granada. The play was written between 1923 and 1925 and was first performed in June 1927 at the Teatre Goya in Barcelona. That production was directed by García Lorca, with scenic design and costumes by Salvador Dalí, and was performed by the company of Margarida Xirgu. The play received its Madrid première that October, at the Teatro Fontalba.Edwards (1980, 31). In contrast to García Lorca's first play, The Butterfly's Evil Spell, which was first performed in 1920 but which closed after only four performances, Mariana Pineda was a success. Consequently, García Lorca often claimed that Mariana Pineda was his first play. The play figures prominently in the opera Ainadamar (2003) by Osvaldo Golijov. Several TV/film revivals based on Lorca's original play eg starring Krista Keller 1931-1988 and later Marthe Keller were produced in 1960s. Pineda's house (Identification is Contested) in central Granada is now maintained as a small hotel//museum and provides a convenient backdrop for these recent revivals. Honors The Spanish airline, Iberia, has named one of its airplanes after the play and the person it was based on.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4YOfbXozhw References A parallel English-Spanish version with extensive notes has been prepared by Dr Robert G Havard (Aris & Phillips 1987) Sources * Edwards, Gwynne. 1980.

Greenway has stated his nickname \\"Barney\\" came from a time when he used to drink alcohol. He stated he would get so drunk that when he went anywhere, he would bump into everything. From this behaviour, he would be called \\"Rubble\\", which changed to \\"Barney Rubble\\" and then just \\"Barney\\".  Career  Greenway performing with Napalm Death at Tampere, Finland, 2009 Greenway was initially the vocalist of death metal band Benediction from 1989 until he joined Napalm Death the following year, replacing the band's previous vocalist Lee Dorrian, who later founded doom metal band Cathedral. Prior to joining Napalm Death, Greenway had worked as an engineer within the motor industry in Birmingham. Greenway's first album with Napalm Death, Harmony Corruption represented a shift in the band's musical style, incorporating a more death metal-oriented sound. The albums that followed this, including Utopia Banished, Fear, Emptiness, Despair and Diatribes saw the band delve further into the aforementioned style whilst also incorporating elements of groove metal. Greenway and Napalm Death parted ways in 1996, with bassist Shane Embury referring to the long unrest that had been present between Greenway and the remainder of the band. Greenway later joined Extreme Noise Terror to record vocals on their album Damage 381, with Extreme Noise Terror's vocalist Phil Vane joining Napalm Death to record vocals on their album Inside the Torn Apart. Vane and Napalm Death however were incompatible according to Embury, and after discussions between Greenway and the band, Greenway returned to record the vocals for the above album. Greenway has remained with Napalm Death since 1997 and have since released a number of critically acclaimed albums.  Personal life  Greenway is a progressive metal fan. He joined Dream Theater on stage at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club and performed vocals on Metallica's \\"Damage, Inc.\\" live. He has reviewed progressive metal bands and albums for the British rock magazine Kerrang! though he no longer does so. He has also stated his admiration for bands such as Motörhead and Throbbing Gristle, stating that the former's album, Ace of Spades, is his all-time favourite album. Greenway is also a voracious reader. Greenway is a supporter of Aston Villa F.C.. He is a supporter of many animal rights organisations including PETA; he has been a vegetarian since he was 14, and vegan since 2012. Greenway is recognisable for his strong Birmingham accent and for his distinctive gruff vocal style which many feel has become synonymous with Napalm Death. Greenway is an atheist.

It was founded in 1936 as Norway's first business school and has since its establishment been a leading teaching and research institution in the fields of economics and business administration. Admission to NHH is the most selective in the field of business administration in Norway and among the most selective of all study programs offered in Norway. The sole NHH undergraduate program consistently ranks among the most popular first choice for students applying to undergraduate study in Norway and was the most popular first choice of all undergraduate programs offered in Norway 2020, with more than 2,100 first choice applications (and more than 5,000 in total) for 500 places. The school participates in exchange programs with more than 170 foreign business schools and universities in over 50 countries, and around 40 percent of the school's students spend at least one semester on exchange. The school is member of CEMS (The Global Alliance for Management Education) and the Partnership in International Management (PIM) network, and is accredited by EQUIS and AMBA. History Traditionally, economics as an academic discipline was only taught at the universities in Norway (mainly the University of Oslo, where it was first conceived as a sub-discipline of law in the 19th century) whereas business administration was not regarded as an academic discipline, with no formal education program being available. NHH was founded to offer the first formal training in business studies in the form of a more vocational, two-year degree, called handelskandidat (\\"candidate of commerce\\"). In 1963 the handelskandidat degree was renamed siviløkonom and it later evolved into a four-year degree. The school today offers degrees at the master's and doctoral levels. =1900–1936: Establishing a business school in Norway= The business communities in Oslo and Bergen began discussing the establishment of a Norwegian business school at the end of the 19th century. A number of schools had been opened across Europe and during the early 20th century several business schools were established in Scandinavia based on the German handelshochschule (business school) model. Amongst them, the Stockholm School of Economics was established in 1909. In 1917, Norway's parliament (the Storting) passed a resolution to establish a Norwegian business school. =1936–1963: NHH opens and sets to work= After much lobbying and hard work, especially by Kristoffer Lehmkuhl, NHH was finally opened by King Haakon VII on Monday the September 7, 1936. This was 10 years before the University of Bergen was established. The strong involvement of the business community in Bergen had ensured that not only was the school established, but that it was established in Bergen and was closely linked to business community from the very start. When NHH first opened, the academic staff consisted of fewer than ten people and sixty students were enrolled each year. The first degree course offered was the Handelsdiplom (business diploma) and graduates received the title Handelskandidat (business graduate). This was initially a two-year course and, starting in 1938, a one-year additional course was offered to candidates who wanted to become teachers. In 1946 the Handelsdiplom course was extended to three years. After the Second World War, American influence became more important and also started to influence NHH to a greater extent. Graduates and staff began to go to the US to continue their studies and work for a period, a trend that greatly increased in the 1960s and 1970s. By the early 1950s the need for a doctoral programme at NHH had grown. In 1956, NHH received permission from the Norwegian government to award doctorates and in 1957 the first doctoral candidate graduated from NHH. =1963–1980: A new campus and rapid growth= By the late 1950s NHH had outgrown its original premises and work began on developing a new campus for the school at Sandviken, just outside Bergen city centre. In 1963, the school moved to its new campus, an event which in many ways marked the transition to a new period characterised by a rapid increase in the number of students as well as teachers. The new campus provided a large increase in capacity and the annual intake of students increased from 60 to over 200. An important feature of this period was the growth and development of the faculty. The new facilities made it possible to employ many new, talented people and the importance of research as well as teaching was strengthened. Many successful graduates went to the US to study for doctorates and came back to NHH with international experience and a more research based focus. Many faculty members took advantage of sabbaticals to study and continue their research overseas, many textbooks were published and the volume of publications in international journals increased significantly. A driving force behind this expansion and internationalisation of research was Professor Karl Borch. During this time Professor Jan Mossin's seminal paper \\"Equilibrium in a Capital Asset Market\\" was published in Econometrica, contributing significantly to the development of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). About the same time as Mossin returned to NHH from Carnegie Mellon with his doctorate, future Nobel laureate Finn E. Kydland went to the same university for his doctoral studies. Most of the US educated doctoral graduates came back to NHH to teach and continue their research, but some stayed in the US and a few (like Kydland) returned to NHH only to later go back to the US to continue their work. As the faculty grew and developed so did the academic offerings, with several advanced level courses established. In 1963 the name of the Handelsdiplom degree was changed to siviløkonom, with graduate receiving the same title. A master level programme, høyere avdelingstudium (HAS), was introduced in 1972 as a preparation for siviløkonom students wishing to continue on to doctoral studies; and in 1973 Professor Dag Coward established a master level programme for students wishing to specialise in auditing, accounting and the financial management of firms, the høyere revisorstudium (HRS). In 1975 the siviløkonom degree course was extended to a four-year programme. =1980–2000: Specialisation and international expansion= In the early 1980s it was realised that the doctoral programme required updating and a new, structured PhD programme was introduced involving taught courses in addition to the research and writing of a thesis. This new PhD programme continued the focus on research at NHH, rather than just teaching. The first candidate to graduate from the new PhD programme did so in 1985 and the annual number of graduates rose from 1 in 1985 to 12 in 1990. The focus on expansion and internationalisation of research was recognised in 1984 as NHH was ranked 7th globally and 3rd in Europe in the American Economic Review amongst economics schools or departments in non-English speaking countries by publications in leading journals. During this period, close relations with international research environments were also established. The international activities at the school have increased considerably and the international focus has become stronger over the years. In 1984 NHH established their first international exchange agreement with the Stockholm School of Economics, and in 1986 NHH became the first institution in Norway to offer a master's degree programme taught entirely in English - the Master of International Business (MIB). Following this, greater emphasis has been placed on exchange arrangements for students, and the school joined the prestigious Community of European Management Schools (CEMS) and the Erasmus programme in 1992 and the global Partnership in International Management (PIM) network in 1995. Student and staff numbers continued to rise throughout the 1980s and 1990s. By 1985 there were 1670 students and 198 members of staff in total. =2000–present: Continued growth and development into the 21st century= NHH alumni Finn Kydland was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2004 (with Edward C. Prescott) for his contributions to dynamic macroeconomics The siviløkonom qualification was extended to 5 years in 2003. In line with the Bologna declaration, it now comprises a 3-year Bachelor of Science in Economics and Business Administration combined with a 2-year Master of Science in Economics and Business Administration. NHH alumnus and Adjunct Professor Finn E. Kydland was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2004, together with Professor Edward C. Prescott of Arizona State University. Kydland was giving a lecture at NHH when news of the award arrived. Prescott was a Visiting Professor of Economics at NHH in 1974-75. In 2007 NHH announced the launching of a new master programme taught fully in English, the MSc in Energy, Natural Resources and the Environment. Today, NHH is part of a global network of business schools and universities. International partner institutions include: * Columbia University * Cornell University * University of California, Berkeley * New York University * Duke University * HEC Paris * Bocconi University * London School of Economics * Imperial College London On June 1, 2011, the school simplified and changed its English name from the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration to the Norwegian School of Economics. =List of rectors= #Ingvar Wedervang, 1936–1956 #Eilif W.

In 2013, NHH was ranked as the 46th best European business school by the Financial Times. Student life Like all public institutions of higher education in Norway, NHH does not charge tuition fees. However, a small semester fee of NOK 490 (roughly US$80) is charged. This money helps fund the Student Welfare Organisation in Bergen, which subsidises kindergartens, health services, housing and cultural initiatives. The Student Association at NHH (NHHS) has groups to accommodate many student interests. As would be expected for a leading business school, NHHS has many groups involved with economics and business issues. These groups maintain contact with the business community and serve to stimulate interest in and improve knowledge of various sectors Norwegians and international business. This is achieved through conferences, seminars, company visits, excursions in Norway and abroad and trainee programs in various businesses. The Student Association is led by a board of seven people - Kjernestyret. * NHH has several bands and choirs. Although each choir and band has their own distinct character and charm, they do have some common features.

Although some of the line was constructed between 1901 and 1906, it never opened and eventually became part of the Welsh Highland Railway.  History  Nant Gwynant power station There were several attempts by the North Wales Power and Traction Company to promote lines between Portmadoc and Beddgelert with extensions at either end. These culminated in a proposal in 1901, for a narrow gauge electric railway to use three phase alternating current at about 630 volts using the system devised by Ganz of Budapest. =Proposed route= The PB&SSR; would have run from the western end of Black Rock sands via Morfa Bychan, Borth y gest, Portmadoc and, using part of the Croesor Tramway, to Beddgelert to link with the South Snowdon Quarries (hence the title) in the Gwynant Valley. There was no intention initially to connect with the North Wales Narrow Gauge system which, at that time, terminated at , a station near the hamlet of Rhyd Ddu. No railway construction was started but, by 1903, a revised scheme was being put forward to link up with the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways Beddgelert extension. This resulted in a further revised scheme being approved in 1904. It appears that there were legal problems with the powers given and, in 1906, these were reapproved with amendments. =Construction= Work started around 1906 and continued for a couple of years before being abandoned (certainly no work done after 1910). The line from Snowdon (Rhyd Ddu) was virtually complete for well over a mile and was used for a while (mainly during World War I) to extract timber from Beddgelert forest. At the Beddgelert end a roughly laid track for horse-drawn wagons was also used for timber. The original intention to run to Black Rock had been forgotten and no mention was made of the line to South Snowdon quarries. However, in 1908, they did promote a further line up the Gwynant Valley and on to Betws y coed. No work was done on this line. =Abandonment of the PBSSR= Bridge abutments between Beddgelert and the Aberglaslyn pass The North Wales Power and Traction Co Ltd, the sole PBSSR backer, overspent on the construction of the power station. It started generating electricity in September 1906, but meanwhile, completion of the railway and electrifying the NWNGR took a back seat, and in January 1906 J.C. Russell, Chairman and Managing Director of the NWNGR, insisted on terms for a two-year delay which included expenditure on \\"restoring the NWNGR for present steam working and providing one steam locomotive for a sum not exceeding £2,500\\". This resulted in the arrival of Russell as NWNGR property. In the event this delay led to an abandonment. Sections of abandoned cuttings and embankments of the original route still survive in the Beddgelert area. These include an abandoned embankment, a completed bridge over the A498 at the southern end of Beddgelert village near the Royal Goat Hotel and nearby bridge abutments in a field. The abutments of the Afon Glaslyn bridge were also constructed and the one of the west bank is now a Welsh Water Authority measuring station. =Welsh Highland Railway= The PBSSR and North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways were later amalgamated and became the Welsh Highland Railway. Some work undertaken for the PBSSR was used for the Welsh Highland Railway. Motive power Ten electric locomotives were ordered from Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd. of Edinburgh who held a licence from Ganz. At least six were built, although none were delivered. All six were scrapped during the First World War. The electrification project was abandoned about 1906 and a steam locomotive \\"Russell\\" was ordered from the Hunslet Engine Company of Leeds. It was intended to electrify all the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways once the two lines were connected. In 1914, local councils got together to try to get the building restarted but failed due to the start of World War I. Another attempt was made after the war which resulted in the building of the Welsh Highland Railway following most of the same route but with changes made near Beddgelert to ease the gradients to allow the use of steam locos. The electricity was to be produced at a hydro electric power station further up the Gwynant Valley and surplus power was to be available for local domestic and industrial use. This part of the scheme was actually built and the power station still operates.

He wrote over 26 books and multiple monographs and magazine articles, including many standard works on Anglo-American genealogy. He worked for the British Foreign Office, posted to the British embassy Belgrade 1954–1956 and subsequently at the Central Office of Information (COI)1956-1987. In retirement he frequently worked at the British Public Record Office, now known as The National Archives, where he discovered unpublished material on the early American colonists. His resulting articles published in the National Genealogical Society Quarterly (NGSQ) led to his recognition and several awards of excellence. He pioneered the then neglected field of English convict transports to America and indentured servants. His documentation and writing of the book \\"Passengers and Ships to America, 1618–1668\\" was cited by author Meredith B. Colket in 2002 as, \\"the most important addition to our knowledge of early New England that has appeared in over a century.\\" Awards Coldham was awarded the Julian Bickersteth memorial medal, aka the Bickersteth Medal, in 1991.

After years of painstaking research, the names of nearly all those sentenced to penal transportation were extracted from official court records by Peter Coldham and published in the landmark work The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage in 1988 and its Supplement in 1992, forming the largest and most complete passenger list of its kind ever published. From this unexpected source the researcher at last had the means of learning the names of the persons transported to the colonies, the charges against them, the dates and places of sentencing, the ship names, and the places of arrival in the colonies. Supplement to The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage, 1614-1775 The original volume of Emigrants in Bondage published in 1988 acknowledged that there were some notable omissions from the list of transported felons then printed, which remained to be researched and remedied. The Supplement of 1992 began to supply the omissions, but with the publication of More Emigrants in Bondage, Mr. Coldham closed the remaining gaps. Altogether there are some 9,000 new and amended records in this important new work, which is arranged and annotated in the same way as the parent volume. To the original list of 50,000 records, these additions come as a windfall, arising from the availability of previously closed archival resources and the re-examination of conventional transportation records such as Assize Court records, Circuit Court records, and the quaintly-named Sheriffs' Cravings, to which can be added newspapers and printed memoirs. The addition of 9,000 records to the canon makes this the most important list of ships' passengers to be published in years. Whether as a list of additions or corrections, this new work is an indispensable tool in the researcher's arsenal, and anyone using the parent volume and supplement cannot possibly ignore this volume. Questions about the peopling of colonial America come readily to mind when looking at a book like this—questions about ancestors, too—and the answers found here are both challenging and surprising. = Works include = *The Complete Book of Emigrants, 1607-1660 *The Complete Book of Emigrants, 1661-1699 *The Complete Book of Emigrants, 1700-1750 *The Complete Book of Emigrants, 1751-1776 *The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage, 1614-1775 *Supplement to The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage, 1614-1775 *American Migrations 1765-1799.

Act I reveals that The Groom's father was killed a few years ago by men from the Felix family. When The Groom asks for a knife to cut olives in the vineyard, The Mother reacts cautiously. Before giving The Groom the knife, she discusses the cycles of violence and her trepidation. The Groom leaves after hugging his mother goodbye. The Neighbor arrives to chat with The Mother, and reveals to her that The Bride was previously involved with a man named Leonardo Felix, a relative of the men who killed The Mother's husband. The Mother, who still hates the Felix family, is furious, but decides to visit the girl before bringing the matter up with The Groom. Leonardo, who is now married, returns to his home after work. When he enters, The Mother-In-Law and Wife are singing a lullaby to Leonardo's son. The lullaby's lyrics foreshadow the tragedies that will occur later in the play. It is clear that Leonardo's marriage is not a happy one. A Little Girl enters the house and tells the family that The Groom is preparing to marry The Bride. Leonardo flies into a rage, scaring his Wife, Mother-In-Law, and A Little Girl as he storms out of the house. The Mother goes to The Bride's house, along with The Groom, where she meets the Bride's Servant and the Father of The Bride. The Father tells The Mother about his dead wife and his desire to see his daughter marry and bear children. The Bride enters and speaks with The Mother and The Groom. The Father then shows them out, leaving The Servant with The Bride. The Servant teases The Bride about the gifts that The Groom brought, then reveals to her that Leonardo has been coming to the house at night to watch The Bride's window. =Act two= The morning of the wedding, Leonardo comes to see The Bride again. He speaks of his burning desire for her and the pride that kept him from marrying her before. The Bride, disturbed by his presence, attempts to silence him, but cannot deny that she still has feelings for him. The Servant sends Leonardo away, and the guests begin arriving for the wedding. The Father, The Mother, and The Groom arrive, and the wedding party moves to the church. The Bride begs The Groom to keep her safe. Leonardo and his Wife go as well, after a short and furious argument. After the wedding, the guests, the families, and the newlywed couple return to the Bride's house. The party progresses, with music and dancing, but the Bride retires to her room, claiming that she feels tired. Leonardo's Wife tells the Groom that her husband left on horseback, but the Groom brushes her off, saying that Leonardo simply went for a quick ride. The Groom returns to the main room and speaks with his Mother. The guests then begin searching for the Bride and Groom, hoping to begin a traditional wedding dance. But the Bride is nowhere to be found. The Father orders the house searched, but Leonardo's Wife bursts into the room and announces that her husband and the Bride have run off together. The Father refuses to believe it, but the Groom flies into a rage and rides off with a friend to kill Leonardo. The Mother, frenzied and furious, orders the entire wedding party out into the night to search for the runaways, as the Father collapses in grief. =Act three= Out in the forest (to which Leonardo and The Bride have fled), three woodcutters emerge to discuss the events (in a manner somewhat similar to that of a Greek chorus, except that they speak to each other, not to the audience). They reveal that the searchers have infiltrated the entire forest, and that Leonardo, who is, after all, carrying a woman, will be caught soon if the moon comes out. As they flee the stage, The Moon appears in the form of a young woodcutter with a white face. He states that by the end of the night, blood will be spilt. Death, disguised as an old beggar woman, enters and speaks of the finiteness of life and how the night will end in death. She orders The Moon to provide much light before exiting. Up in fury, the Groom enters along with a Youth from the wedding party. The Youth is disturbed by the dark forest and urges the Groom to turn back, but the Groom refuses, vowing to kill Leonardo and reclaim his Bride. Death, disguised, re-enters, telling the Groom that she has seen Leonardo and can lead the Groom to him. The Groom exits with her. Elsewhere, in the forest specifically, The Woodcutters are fervently chopping wood, praying that the lovers will be spared before exiting. Leonardo and The Bride run on and discuss their future together. Both are filled with romantic angst and consumed by their burning, unsustainable love for each other, as passion like no other is shared between the two of them. The Bride begs Leonardo to flee, but he refuses. The couple hear footsteps; the Groom and Death are coming near. Leonardo exits, and two screams ring out in the darkness. The Moon and Beggar woman reappear at the end of the scene. Leonardo and the Groom have killed each other. In the town, the women (including Leonardo's wife and mother-in-Law) have gathered near the church to whisper of the events. Death arrives in the disguise of the beggar woman and, before departing, announces that doom has visited the forest. The Mother enters the church, full of anger and black bitterness, only to see The Bride returning—her dress covered in the blood of her lovers who killed each other in the forest. Presumably, (although this is never explicitly stated, and it happens after the play's end) The Bride is afterwards killed as a sacrifice to restore the family's honour. Still, in some incarnations of the play, it is suggested that The Mother allows The Bride to live based on the idea that living with the pain of her lovers' deaths is a more severe punishment than death.

POSIX and conventional Unix file system permissions are organized into three classes, user, group, and others. The use of groups allows additional abilities to be delegated in an organized fashion, such as access to disks, printers, and other peripherals. This method, among others, also enables the superuser to delegate some administrative tasks to normal users, similar to the Administrators group on Microsoft Windows NT and its derivatives. A group identifier, often abbreviated to GID, is a numeric value used to represent a specific group.http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_189 The range of values for a GID varies amongst different systems; at the very least, a GID can be between 0 and 32,767, with one restriction: the login group for the superuser must have GID 0. This numeric value is used to refer to groups in the \`/etc/passwd\` and \`/etc/group\` files or their equivalents. Shadow password files and Network Information Service also refer to numeric GIDs. The group identifier is a necessary component of Unix file systems and processes.  Supplementary groups  In Unix systems, every user must be a member of at least one group, the primary group, which is identified by the numeric GID of the user's entry in the passwd database, which can be viewed with the command \`getent passwd\` (usually stored in \`/etc/passwd\` or LDAP). This group is referred to as the primary group ID. A user may be listed as member of additional groups in the relevant entries in the group database, which can be viewed with \`getent group\` (usually stored in \`/etc/group\` or LDAP); the IDs of these groups are referred to as supplementary group IDs.  Effective vs. real  Unix processes have an effective (EUID, EGID), a real (UID, GID) and a saved (SUID, SGID) ID. Normally these are identical, but in \`setgid\` processes they are different.  Conventions  = Type = Originally, a signed 16-bit integer was used. Since the sign was not necessary – negative numbers do not make valid group IDs – an unsigned integer is now used instead, allowing group IDs between 0 and 65,535. Modern operating systems usually use unsigned 32-bit integers, which allow for group IDs between 0 and 4,294,967,295. = Reserved ranges = Many Linux systems reserve the GID number range 0 to 99 for statically allocated groups, and either 100−499 or 100−999 for groups dynamically allocated by the system in post-installation scripts. These ranges are often specified in \`/etc/login.defs\`, for \`useradd\`, \`groupadd\` and similar tools. On FreeBSD, porters who need a GID for their package can pick a free one from the range 50 to 999 and then register this static allocation in ports/GIDs.FreeBSD Porter's Handbook, Section 6.26: Adding Users and Groups = Special values = * 0: The superuser normally has a GID of zero (0). * −1: The value \`(gid_t) -1\` is reserved by POSIX to identify an omitted argument.http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/chown.html * 65,534: The Linux kernel defaults to 216−2 = 65,534 (which many Linux distributions map to the group name \\"nogroup\\") when a 32-bit GID does not fit into the return value of a 16-bit system call.https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/ The value is also returned by idmapd if a group name in an incoming NFSv4 packet does not match any known group on the system.  Personal groups  Many system administrators allocate for each user also a personal primary group that has the same name as the user's login name, and often also has the same numeric GID as the user's UID. Such personal groups have no other members and make collaboration with other users in shared directories easier, by allowing users to habitually work with \`umask 0002\`. This way, newly created files can have by default write permissions enabled for group members, because this will normally only enable write access for members of the personal group, that is only for the file's owner. However, if a file is created in a shared directory that belongs to another group and has the setgid bit set, then the created file will automatically become writable to members of that directory's group as well. On many Linux systems, the \`USERGROUPS_ENAB\` variable in \`/etc/login.defs\` controls whether commands like \`useradd\` or \`userdel\` automatically add or delete an associated personal group.

It was written in 1934 and first performed that same year. García Lorca describes the play as \\"a tragic poem.\\" The play tells the story of a childless woman living in rural Spain. Her desperate desire for motherhood becomes an obsession that eventually drives her to commit a horrific crime. Plot * Act 1, scene 1: Yerma has been married two years. She wants to strengthen her husband, Juan, so he can give her children. Telling Yerma to stay at home, Juan goes back to his work in the olive groves, and Yerma talks and sings to the child she wishes she were carrying. María, married five months and already pregnant, asks Yerma to sew for the baby. Yerma fears that if she, too, doesn't conceive soon, her blood will turn to poison. The couple's friend, Víctor, sees Yerma sewing and assumes she is pregnant. His advice when he learns the truth: Try harder. *Act 1, scene 2: Yerma has just taken Juan his dinner in the fields. On the road home, she encounters an old woman who insists that passion is the key to conception. Yerma admits a secret longing for Víctor but none for Juan. She then meets two girls whose attitudes astonish her. One has left her baby untended. The other is childless and glad of it, although her mother, Dolores, is giving her herbs for pregnancy. Next Víctor comes along, and the conversation between Víctor and Yerma becomes tense with unspoken thoughts and desires. Juan enters, worrying about what people will say if Yerma stays out chatting. He tells her he intends to work all night. Yerma will sleep alone. *Act 2, scene 1: It is three years later. Five laundresses gossip about a woman who still has no children, who has been looking at another man, and whose husband has brought in his sisters to keep an eye on her. We know they mean Yerma. The laundresses sing about husbands, lovemaking, and babies. *Act 2, scene 2: Juan's two sisters watch over Yerma. She refuses to stay at home, and people are talking. Without children in it, her house seems like a prison to her. Her marriage has turned bitter. María visits, but reluctantly since the sight of her baby always makes Yerma weep. The childless girl says her mother, Dolores, is expecting Yerma. Víctor comes in to say goodbye. Yerma is surprised and a little saddened by Víctor's announcement to go. When she asks him why he must go he answers along the lines of “things change.” Juan enters and it is later found out that Juan has bought Víctor's sheep. It would seem that Juan is one of the reasons why Víctor is leaving. Yerma is angered, and when Juan goes out with Víctor, Yerma makes her escape to see Dolores. Lorca, Pura Maórtua and Valle-Inclán, Madrid, 1934. *Act 3, scene 1: Yerma is found at Dolores's house. Dolores and the old woman have been praying over Yerma all night in the cemetery. Juan accuses Yerma of deceit, and she curses her blood, her body, and her father \\"who left me the blood of the father of a hundred sons.\\" *Act 3, scene 2: The scene begins near a hermitage high in the mountains, a place to which many barren women, including Yerma, have made a pilgrimage. Young men are there, hoping to father a child or to win a woman away from her husband. The old woman tells Yerma to leave Juan and take up with her son, who is \\"made of blood,\\" but Yerma holds to her sense of honor and dismisses that thought. Juan overhears and tells Yerma to give up wanting a child, to be content with what she has. Realizing that Juan never did and never will want a child, Yerma strangles him, thus killing her only hope of ever bearing a child. The play ends with Yerma saying, \\"Don't come near me because I've killed my son. I myself have killed my son!\\" Characters *Yerma: a young woman whose desire for a child is so strong that she speaks and sings to the not-yet-created baby. Because her marriage seems to be without love, she believes a child will bring her the joy she so desperately seeks. She feels empty and unfulfilled without a child, but is not able to achieve success with her distant husband Juan. However unhappy she may be in her marriage, she refuses to leave him because of her overwhelming sense of honor and duty. Her name is the feminine version of the adjective yermo, meaning \\"barren.\\" *Juan: Yerma's husband. He does not believe in the child that could be but only in what can be seen and touched. His job is to till the land and help the earth grow, but his wife, whose name means barren land, is left without a child. *Víctor: an old friend of Yerma and Juan. He is a fellow worker of the land. He appears a few times within the play, usually with only Yerma. There may have been something in the past between the two of them, but he was not chosen by her father. *María: Yerma's newly married friend. She is having a baby, and Yerma is saddened by this fact. *Dolores: a woman said to have the powers to help a barren woman get pregnant. *Two sisters-in-law (Las Cuñadas): Juan's sisters who are called on in the second act to watch over Yerma. *Old woman (La Vieja): the voice of reason for Yerma in acts one and two. She is first seen on Yerma's walk to bring Juan food. The old woman gives Yerma advice on how to keep a man and what a woman must do. She has been married twice and has had fourteen children in total. In act three she mentions to Yerma that she has a very available son and that he would be able to give her children. *Six washerwomen: the voice of the town. They represent the various thoughts of the citizens. Some blame Yerma for her lack of children, some are indifferent, others speak up for Yerma. Themes Yerma deals with the themes of isolation, passion, and frustration but also the underlying themes of nature, marriage, jealousy, and friendship. Social conventions of the period also play a large part in the play's plot. The character Yerma, the name meaning barren, is a younger woman with no children. She marries Juan out of honor and duty to her father. She is surrounded by a society that feels that women have a duty to their husband to provide them with heirs. Most of the town's people blame Yerma for her inability to conceive. There also seems to be no love within this marriage, and at times she considers that the reason why she cannot have children. It is hinted in the play that she may have feelings for another, but she refuses to express these feelings because of a strong sense of duty to her husband. Even when the old woman tells her that she has a very fertile son that she can go off with, Yerma refuses by replying, “Do you imagine that I could know another man? And what an idea you have of my honor! ... Did you seriously think I could give myself to another man? ... I don’t go looking for anything.” Her feeling of honor is so overwhelming that even after she has killed her husband, she knows she has lost any hope of a child. Her reasoning: Even after death she cannot marry another. Her honor was to Juan and no one else. There are also overflowing themes of power and struggle. Throughout the play it would seem that Yerma had little or no power in her situation. She had no baby but without the consent of her husband, she has no other options. Her struggle is between her duty to her husband and her inner want of a child. She wants for a child not only because she longs for one but also because during the time that she lives that's all a woman could hope for. Unlike a man, who has the land and his work, a woman has nothing but the care of a child to get her through the day, and she lives day by day without that. Her inner struggle is too great toward the end, and she commands power as she strangles Juan to his death. She has finally stood up for what she wanted and at the same time killed her only chances. Pagan influence “Yerma” has many Christian morals such as marrying for the main reason to procreate and not going outside of the marriage to fix any problems. García Lorca uses the strict rules of the Christian religion to depict Yerma as one not able to act upon natural human drives. As Robert Lima details in his article \\"Toward the Dionysiac: Pagan Elements and Rites in Yerma,\\" García Lorca writes of the naturalness of the pagan ways throughout the play, using as vehicles characters such as the old woman, events such as the pilgrimage, and the four Empedoclean or \\"classical\\" elements, all providing contrast against Christian morals and their operation and effects. The four elements (earth, water, fire, and wind) are noted in the play both directly and indirectly. The elements have been known to represent the four seasons of the year, the four “humors” that represent human temperament, and the four points of the compass. Usually when the elements appear they constitute the foundation of all that exists. García Lorca uses the elements to create a symbolic pattern ironic in that it is Yerma who often refers to the pagan elements yet cannot assimilate them. Earth is first noted in Yerma's offstage lullaby at the beginning of the play when she sings she will make a hut in the field to shelter the child, with the field representing the element Earth. Earth is the element that is representative of mothering and nurturing. This element is the most instinctive in Yerma. In the play she tells of the times when she goes outdoors just to feel her bare feet on the ground. She senses that she must have physical contact with the soil which identifies her with Earth. Juan is also associated with the Earth because of his job in the fields. His life is in the fields, and he is able to fertilize all the soil except that of Yerma. What Yerma does not realize is that to get Juan to want her, she must yield to him as the Earth would do and let go of her fantasy if she has any hope to have a child. The next element, water, is the one that Juan lacks the most. He only has a limited supply of water to irrigate the fields; all that water must go to the land, which means Yerma has no water to quench her thirst. She indistinctly notices that Juan is lacking water and tells him that she would like him to go to the river and swim or go to the roof when the rain drenches the roof. Her mentioning water in two different situations alludes to the fact that she wants Juan to have more water within himself. The symbol of immersion in water can sometimes imply “rebirth.” In contrast, the other male character, Víctor, has a more positive relation to water. There is one instance where Yerma hears Víctor singing offstage and tells him how well he sings and how it sounds like a torrent of water filling his mouth. Her association with him and water reinforce what the old woman said about children rushing to water. Yerma, however, is too late for the very plentiful water of Víctor. The next instance of water is the “cold brook” where the washerwomen gather. This represents Yerma's inability to get pregnant and Juan's coldness to the idea. Both the elements Earth and water are feminine elements, but they cannot be complete without the masculine elements air and fire. Air is seen as male because of the association with “the breath of life” and dynamics of storms and winds. In conjunction with that, air is the medium in which movement occurs and is also the element that surrounds everything in nature. This is suggestive of the male's sexual embrace of a woman. Air is featured many times throughout the play. It is mentioned when Yerma speaks of the wind singing in the trees and when she raises her arms and yawns, which is significant of the deep ritualistic inhalation of the air that made the Earth fertile. Since Yerma cannot be like the Earth and yield or be passive, she must be active in the manifestation of her sexuality. This is what the old woman tried to tell Yerma, and because the old woman is as free as air, she has had two husbands and given birth to fourteen children. Air is also a subject of interest when Juan berates Yerma for her obsession \\"with things that drift in the air.\\" Juan, again, does not exhibit the masculine nature that Yerma desperately hopes for. Víctor, however, embodies the masculine element. In one instance, Yerma goes to the spot where he last stood and takes a deep breath to inhale natural virility. She realizes that he has always had the potential to fill her fully, but alas she is too late and out of honor chooses to stay with Juan. Lastly there is fire, the other male element that carries with it varied meanings. In some traditions, it functioned as purgation, transmutation, and regeneration. Fire also has a traditional association with well-being or ill-health. In Celtic Europe fire was used in major rituals in which bonfires and torches were used to promote fertility of the fields, animals, and humans. One sense of the element fire in Yerma is that of passion, or lack thereof. Yerma mentions how Juan's face lacks the color of life and how his pale skin has not been touched by the fire of the sun's rays. In contrast, Víctor's passionate nature is evident in his life and inner fire. It is toward the end where we see fire start to be represented indirectly with Yerma. She tells Juan how unfair it is for her to be consumed, making reference to fire and being a victim. Wanting to cease being a victim, she goes off to change things for herself. In the end, Juan's lack of passion has fueled her flaming desire to have a child even more. The fact that she goes to the hermitage, where woman walk barefoot on the soil, makes reference to her initial association with the earth. Finally, with Juan stating that he will never want children, Yerma is taken over by her passion. Juan is consumed by her fiery frustration and is finally killed. Legacy Ian Gibson suggests that Yerma is the work of García Lorca's most directly associated with his assassination in the early days of the Spanish Civil War. It most openly challenges the institution of Catholicism and the strict sexual morality of contemporary Spanish society. * Paul Bowles composed an opera based on Yerma in 1955. * Heitor Villa-Lobos composed an opera based on the play; it was premiered in 1971. * In 2001 Pilar Távora directed a noteworthy film version in Spanish, starring Aitana Sánchez-Gijón. * The play In the Red and Brown Water by Tarell Alvin McCraney, written circa 2007, is a loose adaptation of Yerma set in a housing project in Louisiana. =Young Vic Revival= In 2016, Australian playwright Simon Stone premiered an adaption at the Young Vic, starring Billie Piper. The play was an enormous success receiving rave reviews, namely for Piper's \\"earth-quaking\\" performance. The play went on to become one of the most acclaimed and awarded of the decade, with Piper winning all six available Best Actress theatre awards, including the coveted Lawrence Olivier Award, fending off competition from Glenda Jackson. The play saw an unparalleled number of five-star reviews with Piper being described as \\"dangerously draining\\", \\"searing, stunning and unmissable\\". It also won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Revival. It played a second run from July to August 2017 with two live broadcasts to cinemas in the UK on 31 August and international cinemas on 21 September. Encore performances were later added after demand surged. Park Avenue Armory Revival In October 2017, it was announced that Piper would transfer with the show to New York City in 2018. The play was a sold out hit playing for six weeks at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City and was hailed by US critics. The New York Times said Piper's performance was \\"an unconditional victory\\" and \\"blisteringly powerful\\" awarding it five stars, whilst Hollywood Reporter found her \\"simply staggering\\" adding; \\"When the actress appears at the curtain call, looking emotionally and physical exhausted, you find yourself relieved that she's OK and concerned that she'll have to do it all over again the next night.\\" Time Out likened Piper to an \\"angry beast\\" warning that her \\"astonishing\\" performance inflicted psychological-like emotions on the audience. NBC's Katie Englehart said \\"Piper is so devastating I almost vomited in my seat - that doesn't sound like an endorsement but it is.\\" Vogue hailed Piper as \\"one of the great talents of her generation\\" and described her performance as \\"astonishing, raw, feral and terrifying.\\" The AM New York critic claimed to be left \\"gasping for air\\" whilst the New York Stage Review found Piper's \\"downward spiral into abyss utterly harrowing and blazingly remarkable.\\" Bibliography *Edwards, Gwynne.

Commissioned in 1897, she was assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1905. After a refit, she was temporarily put in reserve before returning to service with the Channel Fleet in September 1905. In 1908 and rendered obsolete by the emergence of the dreadnought type of battleships, she once again returned to the reserve, this time with the Home Fleet. After another refit, she had a spell as a gunnery training ship in 1912. Following the outbreak of World War I, Jupiter served with the Channel Fleet and then as a guard ship on the River Tyne. She was dispatched to Russia in February 1915 to serve as an icebreaker, clearing a route to Arkhangelsk while the regular icebreaker was undergoing a refit. She underwent her own refit later in 1915 and once completed, was transferred to the Suez Canal Patrol. She returned to England late 1916, and spent the remainder of the war based at Devonport. She was scrapped in 1920.  Design  Right elevation, deck plan, and hull section as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1902 HMS Jupiter was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple expansion engines powered by eight coal- fired cylindrical boilers. By 1907–1908, she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings. The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL 12-inch Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on pear-shaped barbettes; six of her sisters had the same arrangement, but her sisters and and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes. Jupiter also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF 6-inch /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship's hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher. Jupiter and the other ships of her class had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey armour, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed Jupiter and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armor, and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship's armored deck was thick.  Operational history  HMS Jupiter was laid down by J & G Thomson, Clydebank at Clydebank on 26 April 1894 and launched on 18 November 1895. In February 1897 she was transferred to Chatham Dockyard, where she was completed in May 1897. She was commissioned on 8 June 1897 at Chatham Dockyard for service in the Channel Fleet. She was present at both the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria on 26 June 1897 and the Coronation Fleet Review for King Edward VII on 16 August 1902. Captain John Durnford was appointed in command in October 1899, followed by Captain Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne from December 1900. In March 1901 she visited Cork. The following year she was part of a squadron visiting Nauplia and Souda Bay at Crete for combined manoeuvres between the Channel and Mediterranean fleets in September and October. Captain Sir Richard Poore was appointed in command in December 1902. On 1 January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the new Atlantic Fleet, making her an Atlantic Fleet unit. She was paid off at Chatham on 27 February 1905 to undergo a refit there, and her Atlantic Fleet service ended when she emerged from refit and was commissioned at Chatham into the Portsmouth Reserve on 15 August 1905. Jupiter was commissioned for service in the new Channel Fleet on 20 September 1905. This service ended on 3 February 1908 when she was paid off. By this time, Jupiter had been surpassed in the role of front-line battleship by the new \\"all-big-gun\\" dreadnought battleships inaugurated by in 1906. On 4 February 1908, Jupiter was recommissioned for reserve service in the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet with a nucleus crew. She was flagship of the division from February to June 1909 and later second flagship of the 3rd Division, Home Fleet. During this service, she underwent refits at Portsmouth in 1909–1910, during which she received fire control equipment for her main battery, and 1911–1912. From June 1912 to January 1913 she served as a seagoing gunnery training ship at the Nore. In January 1913 she was transferred to the 3rd Fleet, and was based at Pembroke Dock and Devonport. = World War I = Jupiter at Malta en route to Suez, March 1915 When World War I broke out in August 1914, Jupiter was transferred to the 7th Battle Squadron of the Channel Fleet. During this service, she covered the passage of the British Expeditionary Force from England to France in September 1914. In late October 1914, Jupiter was reassigned to serve alongside her sister ship as a guard ship at the Nore. On 3 November 1914, Jupiter and Majestic left the Nore and relieved their sister ships and of guard ship duty on the Humber. In December 1914, Jupiter moved on to guard ship duty on the Tyne. On 5 February 1915, Jupiter was detached from her guard ship duty to serve temporarily as an icebreaker at Arkhangelsk, Russia, while the regular icebreaker there was under refit. In this duty, Jupiter made history by becoming the first ship ever to get through the ice into Arkhangelsk during the winter; her February arrival was the earliest in history there. Jupiter left Arkhangelsk in May 1915 to return to the Channel Fleet, and was paid off at Birkenhead on 19 May 1915. She then began a refit by Cammell Laird there that lasted until August 1915. Her refit completed, Jupiter was commissioned at Birkenhead on 12 August 1915 for service in the Mediterranean Sea on the Suez Canal Patrol. On 21 October 1915, she was transferred to the Red Sea to become guard ship at Aden and flagship of the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Patrol. She was relieved of flagship duty by the troopship of the Royal Indian Marine on 9 December 1915 and returned to the Suez Canal Patrol for Mediterranean service. This lasted from April to November 1916, with a home port in Port Said, Egypt. Jupiter left Egypt on 22 November 1916 and returned to the United Kingdom, where she was paid off at Devonport to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. She remained at Devonport until April 1919, in commission as a special service vessel and auxiliary patrol ship until February 1918, when she was again paid off. After that she became an accommodation ship. In April 1919, Jupiter became the first Majestic-class ship to be placed on the disposal list. She was sold for scrapping on 15 January 1920, and on 11 March 1920 was towed from Chatham to Blyth to be scrapped.

Kolleru is located between Krishna and Godavari deltas. Kolleru spans into two districts – Krishna and West Godavari. The lake is fed directly by water from the seasonal Budameru and Tammileru streams, and is connected to the Krishna and Godavari irrigation systems by over 67 major and minor irrigation canals. This lake is a major tourist attraction. Many birds migrate here in winter, such as Siberian crane, ibis, and painted storks. The lake was an important habitat for an estimated 20 million resident and migratory birds, including the grey or spot-billed pelican (Pelecanus philippensis). The lake was declared as a wildlife sanctuary in November 1999 under India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and designated a wetland of international importance in November 2002 under the international Ramsar Convention. The wildlife sanctuary covers an area of 308 km2.

This had great impact in terms of pollution, leading to difficulty in getting drinking water for the local people. This is in addition to the loss of ecological diversity and intrusion of sea water into the land masses and its fallout in terms of adverse influence on the rainfall pattern in this region. This imbalance has an adverse effect on the thousands of acres of crop in the upper reaches of sanctuary in view of stoppages water flow into the sea because of obstruction by bunds of the fish tanks that appeared illegally. Kolleru Lake Satellite images taken on 9 February 2001 by the Indian remote sensing satellite found that approximately 42% of the 245 km2 lake was occupied by aquaculture, while agriculture had encroached another 8.5%. The area under aquaculture consisted of 1050 fish ponds within the lake and 38 dried-up fish ponds, which together covered an area of 103 km2. The agricultural encroachments were mostly rice paddies. Surprisingly no clear water could be found in the satellite image. The rest of the lake is being diminished by water diversions or was infested with weeds like elephant grass and water hyacinth. Rich in flora and fauna, it attracts migratory birds from northern Asia and Eastern Europe between the months of October and March. During this season, the lake is visited by an estimated two million birds. The resident birds include grey pelicans, Asian open-bill (Anastomus oscitans), painted storks (Mycteria leucocephala), glossy ibises and white ibises. The migratory birds include red-crested pochards, black-winged stilts, pied avocets, common redshanks, Eurasian wigeons, gadwalls, great cormorants, garganeys, purple herons, greater flamingos, green-winged teals, northern pintails and northern shovelers. Kolleru lake contains numerous fertile islets called lanka's, many of the small ones are submerged during floods. The origin of unusual depression which forms the bed of the lake is unknown, but it was possibly the results of an earthquake. Therefore, many ancient villages are precepted in the bed of the lake as a result of floods and earthquake.  History  Two copper plates of the early Pallava dynasty have been found in the lake, tracing its history to Langula Narasimha Deva (Langulya Gajapathi Raju) a Ganga Vanshi Odisha king, (Oddiya/Odia raju)Vaddiya Rajulu/Vaddi. According to legend, the Gajapathi fort was located at Kolleti Kota on one of the eastern islands of the lake. The enemy general \\"muhammadan\\" probably a Bahamany general encamped at \\"Chiguru kota\\" located on the shores. In some ways, the lake protected the Odia forces. The enemy finally tried to excavate a channel, the modern-day Upputeru, so that the water of the lake would empty into the sea and the level would fall so that they could attack the Gajapathi fort. The royal Odia army general sacrificed his own daughter to propitiate Gods and ensure his success against Muhammadan and her name was \\"Perantala Kanama\\". Therefore, the channel was called Perantala Kanama. Sri Peddinti Ammavari Temple is one of the oldest and famous temples found in Kolleru. The Suryavanshi Gajapatis of Odisha, on the height of their power in the 15th century, ruled over a kingdom extending from the Ganges river in the north to the Kaveri in the south under Gajapati Kapilendra Deva. But by the early 16th century, the Gajapatis lost great portions of their southern dominion to Vijayanagar and Golconda.The Gajapatis were a medieval Hindu Suryavamsi dynasty of Kalinga- Utkal Odisha who ruled large parts of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. During the glorious reign of Kapilendra deva, the first Suryavamsi Gajapati emperor, the boundary of the Kalinga empire (Ancient Odisha) stretched from river Ganges in North to Kaveri in South and from Amarkantak in West to Bay of Bengal(Kalinga Sagara) in east. This lake has a disaster story regarding a quotation many people use it when they lost everything \\"Na kompa kolleru aiyindi \\". It meant that back in '50s, many of the people of Telaprolu village head family's had invested and bought lands near kolleru lake, but due to expansion of lake, they lost all their properties.

Originally called the Hempstead Plains Aerodrome, or sometimes Hempstead Plains field or the Garden City Aerodrome, it was a training field (Hazelhurst Field) for the Air Service, United States Army during World War I. In 1919, it was renamed in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt's son, Quentin, who was killed in air combat during World War I. Roosevelt Field was the takeoff point for many historic flights in the early history of aviation, including Charles Lindbergh's 1927 solo transatlantic flight. It was also used by other pioneering aviators, including Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post. History The Hempstead Plains Aerodrome originally encompassed 900 to east of and abutting Clinton Road, south of and adjacent to Old Country Road, and west of Merrick Avenue. A bluff 15 feet in elevation divided the plain into two large fields. The U.S. Army Signal Corps established the Signal Corps Aviation Station, Mineola on the west field in July 1916, as a pilot training school for members of the National Guard. =World War I= When the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the entire field was taken over and renamed Hazelhurst Field after Leighton Wilson Hazelhurst, Jr. Hazelhurst was a native of Georgia and was a graduate of the United States Military Academy. He reported for aeronautical duty at the Signal Corps Aviation School, Augusta, Georgia, on 2 March 1912. On 11 June 1912, while making a flight at College Park, Maryland as a passenger in an airplane undergoing acceptance tests, the plane crashed to the ground and both the pilot and Lt. Hazelhurst were both killed.Location of U.S. Aviation Fields, The New York Times, 21 July 1918 An adjacent tract of land south of the Hempstead branch line of the Long Island Rail Road was acquired for expansion, becoming Camp Mills along Clinton Road and Hazelhurst Aviation Field No. 2 to the east, part of the massive Air Service Aviation Concentration Center. Hazelhurst Field No. 2 was renamed Mitchel Field on July 16, 1918, to commemorate John Purroy Mitchel, the former mayor of New York killed in a flying accident on July 6 while training with the U.S. Air Service in Louisiana. On September 24, 1918, the Army dedicated the eastern portion of Hazelhurst Field No. 1 as Roosevelt Field.National Archives of the United States: Records of the Training and Operations Group (Air Service) and the Training and Operations Division (Air Corps) Records of the Army Air Forces (AAF), (Record Group 18) 1903-64 (bulk 1917-47) Air Service units that assigned to Hazelhurst Field were:Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint) ;; Permanently assigned: * 46th Aero Squadron (II), July 1918-January 1919 * 52d Aero Squadron (II), July-November 1918 ;; Assigned to Aviation Concentration Center for deployment to AEF: * 168th Aero Squadron, December 1917-January 1918 : Transferred to Port of Entry, Hoboken.

In later returned to Britain being the first aircraft completing an Atlantic crossing in both directions. After the armistice, the Air Service authorized several companies to operate from the fields but maintained control until July 1, 1920, at which time the government sold its buildings and improvements and relinquished control of the property. =Civil use= Once in civilian hands, the owners sold portions along the southern edge of the field and split the remainder of the property into two separate areas. Curtiss Field, a 300-acre airport on the original site of Hazelhurst Field, occupied half of the western portion along Clinton Road. Roosevelt Field occupied the remainder, consisting of seven hangars and a large parking ramp adjacent to Curtiss Field, and an east-west packed clay runway 5000 feet in length on the bluff. The area between Curtiss Field and the Long Island Motor Parkway, which ran north of and parallel to Stewart Avenue, became the Old Westbury Golf Course, while the area to the east of the golf course was used as the Meadow Brook Polo Field, both areas are now completely developed. In pursuit of the Orteig Prize, René Fonck attempted to take off the Sikorsky S-35 from Roosevelt Field's long runway on September 21, 1926, but the aircraft was severely overweight and stressed the auxiliary landing gear mounted to help support the load, losing a wheel. Unable to gain lift speed, the plane cartwheeled off the end of the bluff and burst into flames, killing two of its crew. The following May, operating from a hangar at Curtiss Field, Charles Lindbergh used the Roosevelt Field runway for the takeoff of the Spirit of St. Louis on his flight to Paris. Both fields were bought in 1929 by Roosevelt Field, Inc. The western field, called \\"Unit 2\\", and the runway atop the bluff, called \\"Unit 1\\", were connected by a broad earthen taxi ramp and the consolidated property was named Roosevelt Field. Unit 1 was sold in 1936 and became the Roosevelt Raceway, while Unit 2 continued to operate as an aviation center under the name Roosevelt Field. At its peak in the 1930s, it was America's busiest civilian airfield. =Closure= Roosevelt Field was used by the Navy and Army during World War II. After the war, Roosevelt Field reverted to operation as a commercial airport until it was acquired by real estate developers in 1950. The field closed on May 31, 1951. The eastern field first became an industrial park but is now largely retail shopping, including the Mall at The Source on the site of the former runway, and townhouses, while the site of the original flying field in 1911–1916 has become a shopping mall.

Hypostomus punctatus is a freshwater fish native to South America, in the coastal drainages of southeastern Brazil and Uruguay. It is one of a number of species commonly referred to as 'plecostomus' or 'common pleco' by aquarists. Description Suckermouthed catfish is a species of Loricariidae. Like other members of this family, it has a suckermouth, armor plates, strong dorsal and pectoral fin spines, and the omega iris. These fish grow to about TL. Hypostomus punctatus is difficult to distinguish from closely related species, such as Hypostomus plecostomus. Identification is relatively difficult as there are many different similar species labelled as common pleco. This species has a light brown coloration with a pattern of darker brown spots (the last part of its scientific name, punctatus, means \\"spotted\\"). Because of this, the species may also be known as the spotted hypostomus. There is no striping pattern. Also, they are lighter than H. plecostomus. Habitat and ecology It is found in the wild in fast-flowing rivers as well as in flooded areas. This stream- dweller's preferred water temperature is 22-28 °C, pH range is 5-8, and dH range 0.5-25. The suckermouthed catfish is mainly herbivorous and feeds on algae and detritus as well as plants and roots.

Biography Brask was born in Linköping 1464 to a bourgeois family. He studied philosophy and law at German universities, e.g. Rostock,Entry of Hans Brask in the Rostock Matrikelportal and around 1500 he received a doctoral degree in civil and canon law from Rome. Upon his return to Sweden he first worked as canon and was later, in 1505, appointed cathedral dean in the cathedral of Linköping. He also became a member of the council of the realm (Privy Council of Sweden) and worked for a reconciliation with Denmark, with which Sweden has been at war for some years as part of the ongoing conflicts in the Kalmar Union. In 1513 he was appointed bishop in Linköping. Brask was opposed to Sten Sture's struggle with archbishop Gustav Trolle, but signed a document at the 1517 diet to remove the bishop. According to Olaus Petri's Swedish chronicles, Brask was forced to sign the document. Under his seal he is supposed to have put a note saying \\"\\" - \\"To this I am forced and compelled\\". This legend is the origin of a word in modern Swedish: (\\"brask note\\"), meaning a hidden reservation. The word can have several other meanings, including explanation, excuse, warning, parenthesis, or question mark. It is unrelated to , which is onomatopoeic and roughly means to bang or to rustle. Brask supported the Danish king Kristian II, but was not part of the events that led to the infamous massacre in Stockholm 1520. After Gustav Vasa's rebellion he was forced to join the new king's side, but he would become an opponent of the king's politics. The events of 1527 diet in Västerås led to Brask fleeing the country to Poland. Brask was an active man with many ideas. He was the first man to plan a canal between the two large Swedish lakes, Vänern and Vättern. He was running a printing house in Söderköping.

Orange County officially calls the area Buena Vista North or Orange Center, its original name. Mailing addresses for residents in the area are typically Orlando, Florida except many businesses in the area use Lake Buena Vista as their address. The area is most famous due to the name appearing on many major Orange County roads, including Apopka- Vineland Road, Winter Garden-Vineland Road, Kissimmee-Vineland Road and Taft- Vineland Road. There was also a small town which was abandoned in the 1960s called Vineland. An ACL Railway Depot, Housing, a schoolhouse, a church, the Vineland Cemetery, and many more community facilities were a part of the original town. These roads begin/terminate in the area known as Vineland and Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Vineland is mainly residential, with a mosque Jama Masjid of Orlando, a synagogue, Southwest Orlando Jewish and four shopping center areas with 15 plus restaurants and several hotels and time share resorts, and the eastern entrance to Walt Disney World on Hotel Plaza Blvd. being other land uses.

It is part of the University of Arkansas System. UAFS is the sixth-largest four-year university in Arkansas, with a fall 2019 enrollment of approximately 6,250 students. The university offers in-state tuition rates not only to Arkansas residents, but also those from Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. The university campus occupies of an arboretum that has 1,182 GPS-inventoried trees representing 81 species.  History  300x300px The University of Arkansas–Fort Smith was established in 1928 as an extension of the public school system in Fort Smith, Arkansas, with the superintendent, James William Ramsey, acting as the college president and the high school principal as dean. Known originally as Fort Smith Junior College, the institution operated within the Fort Smith public school system until 1950, when the school was incorporated as a private, nonprofit institution with its own governing board. In September 1952, the College moved from borrowed facilities in the high school to its current site, initially occupying . During the private college era, enrollment increased, as did course offerings, the number of faculty, and facilities. A vocational- technical division was added in 1960. During this period, the college began developing the programs and character of a comprehensive community college—a new concept in Arkansas and across the nation. In the fall of 1965, the Sebastian County electorate approved the creation of the Sebastian County Community Junior College District, along with a tax levy on the real and personal property of the county. The governor appointed a Board of Trustees, and the school again became a public institution. In 1966, the institution's name was changed from Fort Smith Junior College to Westark Junior College, and in 1972, to Westark Community College, indicating the larger area to be served and reflecting the more comprehensive mission. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the college developed and made changes within the context of its mission as a two-year institution. A significant development in 1989 was the establishment of a University Center. Five state universities partnered with the institution to offer six bachelor's and seven master's degree programs on campus. Between 1989 and 2002, 1,788 students graduated with bachelor's degrees through the University Center. In 1997, the Arkansas Legislature passed an act granting Westark the authority to offer in its own right up to nine applied bachelor's degrees, developed in response to identified needs of the industries in the area served. The name of the college was changed yet again in February 1998 to Westark College, more accurately portraying the role and scope of the institution. On December 15, 2000, the Board of Trustees of Westark College entered into an agreement with the Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas to merge with the University of Arkansas System as a four-year institution. In 2001, the Sebastian County electorate voted to support the merger. A formal request to change affiliation status to that of a bachelor's degree-granting institution under the name of the University of Arkansas–Fort Smith was submitted to the Higher Learning Commission in August 2001 and approved by the Institutional Actions Council on November 19, 2001. The merger, which became official on January 1, 2002, endorsed the concept of UAFS as a unique university, one that offers applied and traditional baccalaureate degree programs, one- and two-year associate and technical programs, and non-credit business and industry training programs. In 2006 Arkansas state senator David Bisbee attempted to review the University of Arkansas–Fort Smith's legal status. Bisbee claimed he wanted to make sure the institution was in good legal standing.\\"Beran: UAFS Formed Legally\\"  Colleges  300x300px Recreation and Wellness Center Through its five colleges, UAFS provides certificates of proficiency, technical certificates, associate of arts degrees, associate of general studies, associate of applied science degrees, and bachelor's degrees, as well as work-based learning and community education.

It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As the name indicates, it is performed by visualising the prostate through the urethra and removing tissue by electrocautery or sharp dissection. It has been the standard treatment for BPH for many years, but recently alternative, minimally invasive techniques have become available. This procedure is done with spinal or general anaesthetic. A triple lumen catheter is inserted through the urethra to irrigate and drain the bladder after the surgical procedure is complete. Outcome is considered excellent for 80–90% of BPH patients. The procedure carries minimal risk for erectile dysfunction, moderate risk for bleeding, and a large risk for retrograde ejaculation.  Indications  BPH is normally initially treated medically. This is done through alpha antagonists such as tamsulosin or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride. If medical treatment does not reduce a patient's urinary symptoms, a TURP may be considered following a careful examination of the prostate/bladder through a cystoscope. If TURP is contraindicated a urologist may consider a simple prostatectomy, in and out catheters, or a supra-pubic catheter to help a patient void urine effectively.Collins, MD; Chief Editor: Edward David Kim, MD Transurethral Resection of the Prostate Medscape: As medical management of BPH improves, the numbers of TURPs have been decreasing. Types of TURP Urologist with a rigid cystoscope inserted into the urethra Traditionally, a cystoscope [a resectoscope which has a 30-degree viewing angle, along with resectoscopy sheath & working element] has been used to perform TURP. The scope is passed through the urethra to the prostate where surrounding prostate tissue can then be excised. A monopolar device utilizing a wire loop with electric current flowing in one direction (thus monopolar) can be used to excise tissue via the resectoscope. A grounding ESU pad and irrigation by a nonconducting fluid is required to prevent this current from disturbing surrounding tissues. This fluid (usually glycine) can cause damage to surrounding tissue after prolonged exposure, resulting in TUR syndrome, so surgery time is limited. TURP using a bipolar device is a newer technique that uses bipolar current to remove the tissue. Bipolar TURP allows saline irrigation and eliminates the need for an ESU grounding pad thus preventing post-TURP hyponatremia (TUR syndrome) and reducing other complications. As a result, bipolar TURP is also not subject to the same surgical time constraints of conventional TURP. Another transurethral method utilizes laser energy to remove tissue. With laser prostate surgery a fiber optic cable pushed through the urethra is used to transmit lasers such as holmium-Nd:YAG high powered \\"red\\" or potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) \\"green\\" to vaporize the adenoma. More recently the KTP laser has been supplanted by a higher power laser source based on a lithium triborate crystal, though it is still commonly referred to as a \\"Greenlight\\" or KTP procedure. The specific advantages of utilizing laser energy rather than a traditional electrosurgical TURP is a decrease in the relative blood loss, elimination of the risk of post-TURP hyponatremia (TUR syndrome), the ability to treat larger glands, as well as treating patients who are actively being treated with anti-coagulation therapy for unrelated diagnoses. Risks Because of bleeding risks associated with the surgery, TURP is not considered safe for many patients with cardiac problems. Postoperative complications include: ;Acute complications *Bleeding (most common).

The blood released from the resected prostate may be stuck in the urethra and can cause pain and urine retention. *Bladder wall injury such as perforation (rare). Intraperitoneal bladder rupture will present with upper abdominal pain and referred pain to the shoulder. Extraperitoneal bladder rupture may present with inguinal, peri-umbilical pain. *TURP syndrome: Hyponatremia and water intoxication (symptoms resembling brain stroke in an elderly presenting patient) caused by an overload of fluid absorption (e.g. 3 to 4 Litres) from the open prostatic sinusiods during the procedure. This complication can lead to confusion, changes in mental status, vomiting, nausea, and even coma. To prevent TURP syndrome the 1) length of the procedure is limited to less than one hour in many centers, and 2) the height of the container of irrigating solution above the surgical table determining the hydrostatic pressure driving fluid into the prostatic veins and sinuses is kept to a minimum. The classic triad of TURP syndrome includes elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures with increased pulse pressure, bradycardia, and mental status changes (assuming an awake patient under regional anesthesia).Barash, Clinical Anesthesia, 6th edition, pp. 1365–1368. *The different types of irrigation fluids used for TURP each have specific disadvantages. Glycine irrigating solution may cause transient blindness. Distilled water has the highest risk for intravascular hemolysis, hypervolemia, and dilutional hyponatremia. Balanced salt solutions (such as normal saline) cause electrical current dispersion during TURP but significantly reduce the risk of TURP syndrome. Sorbitol and mannitol solutions may lead to hyperglycemia (sorbitol), intravascular fluid expansion with absorption (mannitol) and an osmotic diuresis (sorbitol and mannitol). ;Chronic complications In most cases, urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction resolve on their own within 6 to 12 months post-TURP. Therefore, many doctors will postpone invasive treatment till after a year passes. Some people also report an improved erectile function after TURP. *Urinary incontinence, most commonly stress incontinence, due to injury of external sphincter system which may be prevented by taking the Verumontanum of the prostate as a distal limiting boundary during TURP. Initial management includes lifestyle changes, bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training, and using incontinence pads. The current gold standard management for persistent urinary incontinence after prostatectomy is the placement of an artificial urinary sphincter. Male slings are an alternative for mild to moderate post-prostatectomy incontinence. *Retrograde ejaculation due to injury of the prostatic urethra. This is one of the most frequent complications of the procedure, which occurs in about 65% of patients. *Bladder neck stenosis. *Erectile dysfunction seen in some patients, however, many have reported that erectile function improved after TURP. Additionally, transurethral resection of the prostate is associated with a low risk of mortality.

It is also effective for treating gastroenteritis. It is ineffective for treating vomiting caused by motion sickness. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a muscle or into a vein. Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, headache, sleepiness, and itchiness. Serious side effects include QT prolongation and severe allergic reaction. It appears to be safe during pregnancy but has not been well studied in this group. It is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors. Ondansetron was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 83rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than nine million prescriptions.  Medical uses  Although an effective antiemetic agent, the high cost of brand-name ondansetron initially limited its use to controlling postoperative nausea and vomiting and chemotherapy- induced nausea and vomiting. = Cancer treatment = The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are the primary medications used to treat and prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. = Postoperative = A number of medications including ondansetron appear to be effective in controlling postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is more effective than metoclopramide, and less sedating than cyclizine or droperidol. = Pregnancy = Ondansetron is used off-label to treat morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum of pregnancy. It is typically used after trials if other drugs have failed. There appears to be a low risk of harm to the baby with use during pregnancy, though there may be an increase in heart problems among the babies. Ondansetron is in pregnancy category B in the US. It is not known if ondansetron is excreted in breast milk. = Cyclic vomiting syndrome = Ondansetron is one of several antiemetic drugs used during the vomiting phase of cyclic vomiting syndrome. = Gastroenteritis = Trials in emergency department settings support the use of ondansetron to reduce vomiting associated with gastroenteritis and dehydration. A retrospective review found it was used commonly for this purpose, being administered in over 58% of cases. Its use reduced hospital admissions, but was also associated with higher rates of return visits to the emergency department. Furthermore, people who had initially received ondansetron were more likely to be admitted on the return visit than people who had not received the drug. However, this effect may simply be due to the agent being used more frequently in people who present with more severe illness. Its use was not found to mask serious diagnoses.  Special populations  = Children = Ondansetron has rarely been studied in people under 4 years of age. As such, little data is available to guide dosage recommendations. = Elderly = It is not necessary to adjust the dosage for people under 75 years of age. The use of ondansetron has not been studied in people older than 75 years of age, and it is not known if dosage should be adjusted for this group. = Poor liver function = The maximum recommended dose for people with severe liver function impairment is 8 mg/day. In these people, ondansetron is cleared from the body at half to one- third the rate as in healthy people. The concentration of ondansetron in body tissues as opposed to plasma is also higher than in healthy people.  Adverse effects  Headache is the most common adverse effect. A review of use for post-operative nausea and vomiting found that for every 36 people treated, one would experience headache, which could be severe. Constipation, diarrhea, and dizziness are other commonly reported side effects. It is broken down by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system. Anecdotally, ototoxicity has also been reported if injected too quickly. = QT prolongation = Use of ondansetron has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to a potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Although this may happen in any person with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in people taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in people with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of injectable ondansetron should not exceed 16 mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24-mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable ondansetron. People are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking ondansetron.US Food and Drug Administration. (2012). FDA Drug Safety Communication: New information regarding QT prolongation with ondansetron (Zofran). Retrieved from = Overdose = No specific treatment is available for ondansetron overdose; people are managed with supportive measures. An antidote to ondansetron is not known.  Pharmacodynamics  Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema in the medulla. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of vagal afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors.  History  A vial of Zofran 4 mg containing ondansetron for intravenous injection Ondansetron (marketed under the brand name Zofran) was developed in the mid-1980s by GlaxoSmithKline in London. It was granted US patent protection in September 1987, received a use patent June 1988, and was approved by the US FDA in January 1991. It was granted another divisional patent in November 1996. Finally, owing to GlaxoSmithKline's research on pediatric use, ondansetron's patent protection was extended until December 2006. By this final year of its patent (2006), Zofran had become the 20th highest-selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales of US$1.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2006 (80% from the US).IHS. (2006). Generics firms line up to enter Zofran market. Retrieved from The first generic versions were approved by the US FDA in December 2006, with marketing approval granted to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and SICOR Pharmaceuticals. In 2018, University of Sao Paulo and Biolab have been granted patent for an orodispersible form of the drug, marketed under the name Vonau, for exclusive commercialization in Brazil until 2028. Approximately 2.5% of the revenue goes to USP to fund further research in other areas.  Society and culture  = Publication bias = In 1997, ondansetron was the subject of a meta-analysis case study published in the British Medical Journal. Researchers examined 84 trials, with 11,980 people receiving ondansetron, published between 1991 and September 1996. Intravenous ondansetron 4 mg versus placebo was investigated in 16 reports and three further reports which had been duplicated a total of six times. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent vomiting within 24 hours was 9.5, with 95% confidence interval 6.9 to 15, in the 16 nonduplicated reports. In the three duplicated reports, the NNT was significantly lower at 3.9 (3.3 to 4.8). When all 25 reports were combined, the apparent NNT improved to 4.9 (4.4 to 5.6). Inclusion of duplicate reports led to a 23% overestimation of ondansetron's antiemetic efficacy. In addition, the authors found the covert duplication of reports on ondansetron was not easy to detect, because of lack of cross-referencing between papers, and reports containing duplicate findings were cited in eight reviews of the drug. Their analysis was a subject of an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1999. = Availability = Ondansetron is a generic drug and is available in many countries under many brand names. Brands include Zofran and Zuplenz. =Routes= It can be given by mouth, as a tablet or orally disintegrating tablet, or by injection into a muscle or into a vein.  Research  = Psychiatric disorders = A 2006 double-blind, randomized controlled trial indicated ondansetron may have value in the treatment of schizophrenia, as an adjunct to haloperidol. The study found the combination to significantly improve negative schizophrenia symptoms, and people taking both drugs experienced fewer of the adverse effects commonly associated with haloperidol. An earlier, smaller, open-label trial had found ondansetron to be useful in treating antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, and the study patients also showed significant improvement in the disease's symptoms. Early studies have also examined ondansetron as a possible treatment for psychosis resulting from advanced Parkinson's disease. Its apparent benefits despite a lack of any significant antagonistic properties at dopamine receptors or the 5-HT2A receptor raises interesting questions about the etiology of psychosis. = Substance use = There is tentative evidence that it may be useful in decreasing the desired effects of alcohol. There is also some tentative evidence in those who are addicted to stimulants. = Postanesthetic shivering = Two small, placebo-controlled trials have been conducted to assess the efficacy of ondansetron for postanesthetic shivering, a common occurrence after surgery. Ondansetron was found to be as effective as pethidine (meperidine, Demerol) when given as a single intravenous dose before anesthesia.

According to a widely cited ranking, Cattell was the 16th most eminent,Eminent Psychologists of the Twentieth Century [Retrieved 22 October 2015] 7th most cited in the scientific journal literature,Haggbloom, S.

He was, however, a controversial figure, due in part to his friendships with and intellectual respect for white supremacists and neo- Nazis. Cattell was an early proponent of using factor analytic methods instead of what he called \\"subjective verbal theorizing\\" to explore empirically the basic dimensions of personality, motivation, and cognitive abilities. One of the results of Cattell's application of factor analysis was his discovery of 16 separate primary trait factors within the normal personality sphere (based on the trait lexicon).Cattell, R. B. & Kline, P. (1977). The Scientific Analysis of Personality and Motivation. New York: Academic. He called these factors \\"source traits\\".Cattell, R. B. (1973).

Innovations and accomplishments Cattell's research was mainly in personality, abilities, motivations, and innovative multivariate research methods and statistical analysis (especially his many refinements to exploratory factor analytic methodology).Cattell, R. B. (1984). The voyage of a laboratory, 1928–1984. Multivariate Experimental Research, 19, 121–174. In his personality research, he is best remembered for his factor-analytically derived 16-factor model of normal personality structure, arguing for this model over Eysenck's simpler higher-order 3-factor model, and constructing measures of these primary factors in the form of the 16PF Questionnaire (and its downward extensions: HSPQ, and CPQ, respectively). He was the first to propose a hierarchical, multi-level model of personality with the many basic primary factors at the first level and the fewer, broader, \\"second-order\\" factors at a higher stratum of personality organization.Cattell, R. B. (1943). The description of personality: I. Foundations of trait measurement. Psychological Review, 50, 559–594. These \\"global trait\\" constructs are the precursors of the currently popular Big Five (FFM) model of personality.Goldberg, L. R. (1993). The structure of phenotypic personality traits.

Boyle et al.(Eds.), The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 1 - Personality Theories and Models. Los Angeles, CA: Sage. Cattell's research led to further advances, such as distinguishing between state and trait measures (e.g., state-trait anxiety),Cattell, R. B., & Scheier, I. H. (1961). The Meaning and Measurement of Neuroticism and Anxiety. New York: Ronald Press. ranging on a continuum from immediate transitory emotional states, through longer-acting mood states, dynamic motivational traits, and also relatively enduring personality traits.Boyle, G. J., Saklofske, D. H., & Matthews, G. (2015). (Eds.), Measures of Personality and Social Psychological Constructs (Ch. 8). Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic. Cattell also conducted empirical studies into developmental changes in personality trait constructs across the lifespan.Nesselroade, J. R. (1984). Concepts of intraindividual variability and change: Impressions of Cattell's influence on lifespan developmental psychology. Multivariate Behavioral Research, 19, 269–286. In the cognitive abilities domain, Cattell researched a wide range of abilities, but is best known for the distinction between fluid and crystallized intelligence. He distinguished between the abstract, adaptive, biologically-influenced cognitive abilities that he called \\"fluid intelligence\\" and the applied, experience-based and learning-enhanced ability that he called \\"crystallized intelligence.\\" Thus, for example, a mechanic who has worked on airplane engines for 30 years might have a huge amount of \\"crystallized\\" knowledge about the workings of these engines, while a new young engineer with more \\"fluid intelligence\\" might focus more on the theory of engine functioning, these two types of abilities might complement each other and work together toward achieving a goal. As a foundation for this distinction, Cattell developed the investment-model of ability, arguing that crystallized ability emerged from the investment of fluid ability in a particular topic of knowledge. He contributed to cognitive epidemiology with his theory that crystallized knowledge, while more applied, could be maintained or even increase after fluid ability begins to decline with age, a concept used in the National Adult Reading Test (NART). Cattell constructed a number of ability tests, including the Comprehensive Ability Battery (CAB) that provides measures of 20 primary abilities,Hakstian, A. R. & Cattell, R. B. (1982). Manual for the Comprehensive Ability Battery. Champaign, IL: IPAT. and the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT) which was designed to provide a completely non-verbal measure of intelligence like that now seen in the Raven's. The Culture Fair Intelligence Scales were intended to minimize the influence of cultural or educational background on the results of intelligence tests.Cattell, R. B. & Cattell, A. K. S. (1977). Measuring Intelligence with the Culture Fair Tests. Champaign, IL: IPAT. In regard to statistical methodology, in 1960 Cattell founded the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP), and its journal Multivariate Behavioral Research, in order to bring together, encourage, and support scientists interested in multi- variate research.Cattell, R. B. (1990). The birth of the society of multivariate experimental psychology. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 26, 48–57. He was an early and frequent user of factor analysis (a statistical procedure for finding underlying factors in data). Cattell also developed new factor analytic techniques, for example, by inventing the scree test, which uses the curve of latent roots to judge the optimal number of factors to extract.Cattell, R. B. (1966). The Scree Test for the number of factors. Multivariate Behavioral Research, 1(2), 245–276. He also developed a new factor analysis rotation procedure—the \\"Procrustes\\" or non-orthogonal rotation, designed to let the data itself determine the best location of factors, rather than requiring orthogonal factors. Additional contributions include the Coefficient of Profile Similarity (taking account of shape, scatter, and level of two score profiles); P-technique factor analysis based on repeated measurements of a single individual (sampling of variables, rather than sampling of persons); dR-technique factor analysis for elucidating change dimensions (including transitory emotional states, and longer-lasting mood states); the Taxonome program for ascertaining the number and contents of clusters in a data set; the Rotoplot program for attaining maximum simple structure factor pattern solutions. As well, he put forward the Dynamic Calculus for assessing interests and motivation,Boyle, G. J. (1988). Elucidation of motivation structure by dynamic calculus. In J.R. Nesselroade & R.B.

Biography =England= Raymond Cattell was born on 20 March 1905 in Hill Top, West Bromwich, a small town in England near Birmingham where his father's family was involved in inventing new parts for engines, automobiles and other machines. Thus, his growing up years were a time when great technological and scientific ideas and advances were taking place and this greatly influenced his perspective on how a few people could actually make a difference in the world. He wrote: \\"1905 was a felicitous year in which to be born. The airplane was just a year old. The Curies and Rutherford in that year penetrated the heart of the atom and the mystery of its radiations, Alfred Binet launched the first intelligence test, and Einstein, the theory of relativity.Child, D. (1998). Obituary: Raymond Bernard Cattell (1905–1998), British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 51, 353–357. When Cattell was about five years old, his family moved to Torquay, Devon, in the south-west of England, where he grew up with strong interests in science and spent a lot of time sailing around the coastline. He was the first of his family (and the only one in his generation) to attend university: in 1921, he was awarded a scholarship to study chemistry at King's College, London, where he obtained a B.Sc.(Hons) degree with 1st-class honors at age 19 years.Horn, J. L. (1998). Introduction of Raymond B. Cattell. In J.J. McArdle & R.W.Woodcock (Eds.), Human Cognitive Abilities in Theory and Practice. (p. 25) While studying physics and chemistry at university he learned from influential people in many other fields, who visited or lived in London. He writes: \\"[I] browsed far outside science in my reading and attended public lectures - Bertrand Russell, H. G. Wells, Huxley, and Shaw being my favorite speakers (the last, in a meeting at King's College, converted me to vegetarianism - for almost two years!\\" (p. 64).Cattell, R. B. (1973). Autobiography. In G. Lindsey (Ed.), A History of Psychology in Autobiography (Vol. VI). New York: Appleton-Century- Crofts. As he observed first-hand the terrible destruction and suffering after World War I, Cattell was increasingly attracted to the idea of applying the tools of science to the serious human problems that he saw around him. He stated that in the cultural upheaval after WWI, he felt that his laboratory table had begun to seem too small and the world's problems so vast. Thus, he decided to change his field of study and pursue a Ph.D in psychology at King's College, London, which he received in 1929. The title of his Ph.D dissertation was \\"The Subjective Character of Cognition and Pre-Sensational Development of Perception\\". His Ph.D advisor at King's College, London, was Francis Aveling, D.D., D.Sc., Ph.D., D.Litt., who was also President of the British Psychological Society from 1926 until 1929.Child, D. (1998).

American Journal of Psychology, 54(4), 608–610. In 1939, Cattell was honored for his outstanding contributions to psychological research with conferral of the prestigious higher doctorate D.Sc. from the University of London. While working on his Ph.D., Cattell had accepted a position teaching and counseling in the Department of Education at Exeter University. He ultimately found this disappointing because there was limited opportunity to conduct research. Cattell did his graduate work with Charles Spearman, the English psychologist and statistician who is famous for his pioneering work on assessing intelligence, including the development of the idea of a general factor of intelligence termed g. During his three years at Exeter, Cattell courted and married Monica Rogers, whom he had known since his boyhood in Devon and they had a son together. She left him about four years later. Soon afterward he moved to Leicester where he organized one of England's first child guidance clinics. It was also in this time period that he finished his first book \\"Under Sail Through Red Devon,\\" which described his many adventures sailing around the coastline and estuaries of South Devon and Dartmoor. =United States= In 1937, Cattell left England and moved to the United States when he was invited by Edward Thorndike to come to Columbia University. When the G. Stanley Hall professorship in psychology became available at Clark University in 1938, Cattell was recommended by Thorndike and was appointed to the position. However, he conducted little research there and was \\"continually depressed.\\" Cattell was invited by Gordon Allport to join the Harvard University faculty in 1941. While at Harvard he began some of the research in personality that would become the foundation for much of his later scientific work. During World War II, Cattell served as a civilian consultant to the U.S. government researching and developing tests for selecting officers in the armed forces. Cattell returned to teaching at Harvard and married Alberta Karen Schuettler, a Ph.D student in mathematics at Radcliffe College. Over the years, she worked with Cattell on many aspects of his research, writing, and test development. They had three daughters and a son. They divorced in 1980. Herbert Woodrow, professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, was searching for someone with a background in multivariate methods to establish a research laboratory. Cattell was invited to assume this position in 1945. With this newly created research professorship in psychology, he was able to obtain sufficient grant support for two Ph.D. associates, four graduate research assistants, and clerical assistance. One reason that Cattell moved to the University of Illinois was because the first electronic computer built and owned entirely by a US educational institution \\"Illinois Automatic Computer\\" was being developed there, which made it possible for him to complete large-scale factor analyses. Cattell founded the Laboratory of Personality Assessment and Group Behavior. In 1949, he and his wife founded the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT). Karen Cattell served as director of IPAT until 1993. Cattell remained in the Illinois research professorship until he reached the university's mandatory retirement age in 1973. A few years after he retired from the University of Illinois he built a home in Boulder, Colorado, where he wrote and published the results of a variety of research projects that had been left unfinished in Illinois. In 1977, Cattell moved to Hawaii, largely because of his love of the ocean and sailing. He continued his career as a part-time professor and adviser at the University of Hawaii. He also served as adjunct faculty of the Hawaii School of Professional Psychology. After settling in Hawaii he married Heather Birkett, a clinical psychologist, who later carried out extensive research using the 16PF and other tests.Birkett-Cattell, H. (1989). The 16PF: Personality in Depth. Champaign, IL: IPAT.Birkett-Cattell, H. & Cattell, H. E. P. (1997). 16PF Cattell Comprehensive Personality Interpretation Manual. Champaign, IL: IPAT. During the last two decades of his life in Hawaii, Cattell continued to publish a variety of scientific articles, as well as books on motivation, the scientific use of factor analysis, two volumes of personality and learning theory, the inheritance of personality, and co-edited a book on functional psychological testing, as well as a complete revision of his highly renowned Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology. Cattell and Heather Birkett Cattell lived on a lagoon in the southeast corner of Oahu where he kept a small sailing boat. Around 1990, he had to give up his sailing career because of navigational challenges resulting from old age. He died at home in Honolulu on 2 February 1998, at age 92 years. He is buried in the Valley of the Temples on a hillside overlooking the sea. His will provided for his remaining funds to build a school for underprivileged children in Cambodia.http://www.cattell.net/devon/rbcschool.htm He was an agnostic. Scientific orientation When Cattell entered the fledgling field of psychology in the 1920s, he felt that the domain of personality was dominated by speculative ideas that were largely intuitive with little/no empirical research basis. Cattell accepted E.L. Thorndike’s empiricist viewpoint that \\"If something actually did exist, it existed in some amount and hence could be measured.\\".Thorndike, E. L. (1932), The Fundamentals of Learning, AMS Press Inc., Cattell found that constructs used by early psychological theorists tended to be somewhat subjective and poorly defined. For example, after examining over 400 published papers on the topic of \\"anxiety\\" in 1965, Cattell stated: \\"The studies showed so many fundamentally different meanings used for anxiety and different ways of measuring it, that the studies could not even be integrated.\\"Cattell, R. B. (1965). The Scientific Analysis of Personality (p. 55). Baltimore, MD: Penguin. Early personality theorists tended to provide little objective evidence or research bases for their theories. Cattell wanted psychology to become more like other sciences, whereby a theory could be tested in an objective way that could be understood and replicated by others. In Cattell's words: :\\"Psychology appeared to be a jungle of confusing, conflicting, and arbitrary concepts. These pre-scientific theories doubtless contained insights which still surpass in refinement those depended upon by psychiatrists or psychologists today. But who knows, among the many brilliant ideas offered, which are the true ones? Some will claim that the statements of one theorist are correct, but others will favour the views of another. Then there is no objective way of sorting out the truth except through scientific research.\\"Cattell, R. B. (1965). The Scientific Analysis of Personality (p. 14). Baltimore, MD: Penguin. Emeritus Professor Arthur B. Sweney, an expert in psychometric test construction,Sweney, A. B., & Cattell, R. B. (1962). Relationships between integrated and unintegrated motivation structure examined by objective tests. Journal of Social Psychology, 57, 217–226. summed up Cattell's methodology: :\\"[Cattell] was without exception the one man who made the most major strides in systematizing the field of behavioral science from all of its diverse facets into a real science based on empirical, replicable and universal principles. Seldom has psychology had such a determined, systematic explorer dedicated not only to the basic search for scientific knowledge but also to the need to apply science for the benefit of all.\\" Also, according to Sheehy (2004, p. 62), :\\"Cattell made fundamental contributions to our understanding of ability and the structure of personality.\\"Sheehy, N. (2004). Fifty Key Thinkers in Psychology (p. 62). London: Routledge. ; ; ; . In 1994, Cattell was one of 52 signatories on \\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence,Gottfredson, L. (December 13, 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence. Wall Street Journal, p. A18. (reprinted in Intelligence, 1997, 24(1), 13–23)\\" an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on IQ research following the publication of the book The Bell Curve. His works can be categorized or defined as part of cognitive psychology, due to his nature to measure every psychological aspect especially personality aspect. Multivariate research Rather than pursue a \\"univariate\\" research approach to psychology, studying the effect that a single variable (such as \\"dominance\\") might have on another variable (such as \\"decision-making\\"), Cattell pioneered the use of multivariate experimental psychology (the analysis of several variables simultaneously). He believed that behavioral dimensions were too complex and interactive to fully understand variables in isolation. The classical univariate approach required bringing the individual into an artificial laboratory situation and measuring the effect of one particular variable on another also known as the \\"bivariate\\" approach, while the multivariate approach allowed psychologists to study the whole person and their unique combination of traits within a natural environmental context. Multivariate experimental research designs and multivariate statistical analyses allowed for the study of \\"real-life\\" situations (e.g., depression, divorce, loss) that could not be manipulated in an artificial laboratory environment. Cattell applied multivariate research methods across several intrapersonal psychological domains: the trait constructs (both normal and abnormal) of personality, motivational or dynamic traits, emotional and mood states, as well as the diverse array of cognitive abilities. In each of these domains, he considered there must be a finite number of basic, unitary dimensions that could be identified empirically. He drew a comparison between these fundamental, underlying (source) traits and the basic dimensions of the physical world that were discovered and presented, for example, in the periodic table of chemical elements. In 1960, Cattell organized and convened an international symposium to increase communication and cooperation among researchers who were using multivariate statistics to study human behavior. This resulted in the foundation of the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP) and its flagship journal, Multivariate Behavioral Research. He brought many researchers from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America to work in his lab at the University of Illinois. Many of his books involving multivariate experimental research were written in collaboration with notable colleagues.For example, The Meaning and Measurement of Neuroticism and Anxiety (1961) with Ivan Scheier, Objective Personality and Motivation Tests (1967) with Frank Warburton, The Prediction of Achievement and Creativity(1968) with Jim Butcher, Handbook of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (1970) with Herbert Eber and Maurice Tatsuoka, Cross-Cultural Comparison (USA, Japan, Austria) of Personality Structure in Objective Tests (1973), with Kurt Pawlik and Bien Tsujioka, Motivation and Dynamic Structure (1975) with Dennis Child, Handbook of Modern Personality Theory (1977) with Ralph Dreger, The Scientific Analysis of Personality and Motivation (1977) with Paul Kline, Personality Theory in Action: Handbook for the Objective-Analytic (O-A) Test Kit (1978) with James Schuerger, Functional Psychological Testing (1986) with Ronald Johnson, the Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (1988) (Rev. 2nd ed.) with John Nesselroade, and The 16PF: Personality in Depth (1989) with Heather Birkett. Factor analysis Cattell noted that in the hard sciences such as chemistry, physics, astronomy, as well as in medical science, unsubstantiated theories were historically widespread until new instruments were developed to improve scientific observation and measurement. In the 1920s, Cattell worked with Charles Spearman who was developing the new statistical technique of factor analysis in his effort to understand the basic dimensions and structure of human abilities. Factor analysis became a powerful tool to help uncover the basic dimensions underlying a confusing array of surface variables within a particular domain. Factor analysis was built upon the earlier development of the correlation coefficient, which provides a numerical estimate of the degree to which variables are \\"co-related\\". For example, if \\"frequency of exercise\\" and \\"blood pressure level\\" were measured on a large group of people, then intercorrelating these two variables would provide a quantitative estimate of the degree to which \\"exercise\\" and \\"blood pressure\\" are directly related to each other. Factor analysis performs complex calculations on the correlation coefficients among the variables within a particular domain (such as cognitive ability or personality trait constructs) to determine the basic, unitary factors underlying the particular domain.McArdle, J. J. (1984). Cattell's contributions to structural equation modeling. Multivariate Experimental Psychology, 19, 245–267. While working at the University of London with Spearman exploring the number and nature of human abilities, Cattell postulated that factor analysis could be applied to other areas beyond the domain of abilities. In particular, Cattell was interested in exploring the basic taxonomic dimensions and structure of human personality. He believed that if exploratory factor analysis were applied to a wide range of measures of interpersonal functioning, the basic dimensions within the domain of social behavior could be identified. Thus, factor analysis could be used to discover the fundamental dimensions underlying the large number of surface behaviors, thereby facilitating more effective research. As noted above, Cattell made many important innovative contributions to factor analytic methodology, including the Scree Test to estimate the optimal number of factors to extract, the \\"Procrustes\\" oblique rotation strategy, the Coefficient of Profile Similarity, P-technique factor analysis, dR-technique factor analysis, the Taxonome program, as well the Rotoplot program for attaining maximum simple structure solutions. In addition, many eminent researchers received their grounding in factor analytic methodology under the guidance of Cattell, including Richard Gorsuch, an authority on exploratory factor analytic methods.Gorsuch, R. L. (1983). Factor analysis. (Rev. 2nd ed.). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Personality theory In order to apply factor analysis to personality, Cattell believed it was necessary to sample the widest possible range of variables. He specified three kinds of data for comprehensive sampling, to capture the full range of personality dimensions: # Life data (or L-data), which involves collecting data from the individual's natural, everyday life behaviors, measuring their characteristic behavior patterns in the real world. This could range from number of traffic accidents or number of parties attended each month, to grade point average in school or number of illnesses or divorces. # Experimental data (or T-data) which involves reactions to standardized experimental situations created in a lab where a subject's behavior can be objectively observed and measured. # Questionnaire data (or Q-data), which involves responses based on introspection by the individual about their own behavior and feelings. He found that this kind of direct questioning often measured subtle internal states and viewpoints that might be hard to see or measure in external behavior. In order for a personality dimension to be called \\"fundamental and unitary,\\" Cattell believed that it needed to be found in factor analyses of data from all three of these measurement domains. Thus, Cattell constructed measures of a wide range of personality traits in each medium (L-data; Q-data; T-data). He then conducted a programmatic series of factor analyses on the data derived from each of the three measurement media in order to elucidate the dimensionality of human personality structure. With the help of many colleagues, Cattell's factor-analytic studies continued over several decades, eventually finding at least 16 primary trait factors underlying human personality (comprising 15 personality dimensions and one cognitive ability dimension: Factor B in the 16PF). He decided to name these traits with letters (A, B, C, D, E...) in order to avoid misnaming these newly discovered dimensions, or inviting confusion with existing vocabulary and concepts. Factor-analytic studies conducted by many researchers in diverse cultures around the world have provided substantial support for the validity of these 16 trait dimensions.Studies that provide support for Cattell's 16-factor theory include: Boyle, G.J.

In order to measure these trait constructs across different age ranges, Cattell constructed (Q-data) instruments that included the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) for adults, the High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ) now named the Adolescent Personality Questionnaire (APQ), and the Children's Personality Questionnaire (CPQ).These personality instruments have been available from IPAT, a test publishing company that Cattell and his wife Karen founded (OPP Ltd., Oxford, England is now the parent company of the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) Inc. of Champaign, Illinois). Cattell also constructed the (T-data) Objective Analytic Battery (OAB) that provided measures of the 10 largest personality trait factors extracted factor analytically,Cattell, R. B. & Schuerger, J. M. (1978). Personality Theory in Action: Handbook for the Objective-Analytic (O-A) Test Kit. Champaign, IL: IPATSchuerger, J. M. (2008). The Objective-Analytic Test Battery. In G.J. Boyle et al. (Eds.), The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 2 – Personality Measurement and Testing. (pp. 529–546). Los Angeles, CA: Sage as well as objective (T-data) measures of dynamic trait constructs such as the Motivation Analysis Test (MAT), the School Motivation Analysis Test (SMAT), and the Children's Motivation Analysis Test (CMAT).Child, D.(1984). Motivation and dynamic calculus: A teacher's view. Multivariate Behavioral Research, 19, 288–298. In order to measure trait constructs within the abnormal personality sphere, Cattell constructed the Clinical Analysis Questionnaire (CAQ)Cattell, R. B. & Sells, S. B. (1974). The Clinical Analysis Questionnaire. Champaign, IL: IPAT.Krug, S. E. (1980). Clinical Analysis Questionnaire Manual. Champaign, IL: IPAT. Part 1 of the CAQ measures the 16PF factors, While Part 2 measures an additional 12 abnormal (psychopathological) personality trait dimensions. The CAQ was later re-badged as the PsychEval Personality Questionnaire (PEPQ).Cattell, R. B., Cattell, A. K., & Cattell, H. E. P. (2003). The PsychEval Personality Questionnaire.

(Eds.), The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 2 – Personality Measurement and testing (pp. 646–662). Los Angeles: Sage. Also within the broadly conceptualized personality domain, Cattell constructed measures of mood states and transitory emotional states, including the Eight State Questionnaire (8SQ)Curran, J. P. & Cattell, R. B. (1976). Manual for the Eight State Questionnaire. Champaign, IL: IPATBoyle, G. J. (1991). Item analysis of the subscales in the Eight State Questionnaire (8SQ): Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Multivariate Experimental Clinical Research, 10(1), 37–65. In addition, Cattell was at the forefront in constructing the Central Trait-State Kit.Barton, K. & Cattell, R. B. (1981). The Central Trait-State Kit (CTS): Experimental Version. Champaign, IL: IPAT.Barton, K. (1985). The Central Trait-State Scales: A Kit of 20 Subtests Measuring Five Central Personality Dimensions as Traits and States, with Equivalent Forms. Champaign, IL: IPAT. From the very beginning of his academic career, Cattell reasoned that, as in other scientific domains like intelligence, there might be an additional, higher level of organization within personality which would provide a structure for the many primary traits. When he factor analyzed the intercorrelations of the 16 primary trait measures themselves, he found no fewer than five \\"second-order\\" or \\"global factors\\", now commonly known as the Big Five. These second-stratum or \\"global traits\\" are conceptualized as broad, overarching domains of behavior, which provide meaning and structure for the primary traits. For example, the \\"global trait\\" Extraversion has emerged from factor-analytic results comprising the five primary trait factors that are interpersonal in focus.Krug, S. E. & Johns, E. F. (1986). A large scale cross- validation of second-order personality structure defined by the 16PF. Psychological Reports, 59, 683–693. Thus, \\"global\\" Extraversion is fundamentally defined by the primary traits that are grouped together factor analytically, and, moving in the opposite direction, the second-order Extraversion factor gives conceptual meaning and structure to these primary traits, identifying their focus and function in human personality. These two levels of personality structure can provide an integrated understanding of the whole person, with the \\"global traits\\" giving an overview of the individual's functioning in a broad-brush way, and the more-specific primary trait scores providing an in-depth, detailed picture of the individual's unique trait combinations (Cattell's \\"Depth Psychometry\\" p. 71). Research into the 16PF personality factors has shown these constructs to be useful in understanding and predicting a wide range of real life behaviors.Conn, S. R. & Rieke, M. L. (1994). The 16PF Fifth Edition Technical Manual. Champaign, IL: IPAT.Russell, M. T. & Karol, D. L. (1994) The 16PF Fifth Edition Administrator's Manual. Champaign, IL: IPAT. Thus, the 16 primary trait measures plus the five major second-stratum factors have been used in educational settings to study and predict achievement motivation, learning or cognitive style, creativity, and compatible career choices; in work or employment settings to predict leadership style, interpersonal skills, creativity, conscientiousness, stress- management, and accident-proneness; in medical settings to predict heart attack proneness, pain management variables, likely compliance with medical instructions, or recovery pattern from burns or organ transplants; in clinical settings to predict self-esteem, interpersonal needs, frustration tolerance, and openness to change; and, in research settings to predict a wide range of behavioral proclivities such as aggression, conformity, and authoritarianism.Cattell, H.

Cattell and the New EugenicsMehler reports he was mentored by Jerry Hirsch, a critic of Cattell at the University of Illinois, where Cattell and Hirsch spent most of their careers. have criticized Cattell based on his writings about evolution and political systems. They argue that throughout his life Cattell adhered to a mixture of eugenics and a new religion of his devising which he eventually named Beyondism and proposed as \\"a new morality from science\\". Tucker also notes that Cattell thanked the prominent neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideologues Roger Pearson, Wilmot Robertson, and Revilo P. Oliver in the preface to his Beyondism, and that a Beyondist newsletter with which Cattell was involved favorably reviewed Robertson's book The Ethnostate. Cattell claimed that a diversity of cultural groups was necessary to allow that evolution. Cattell speculated about natural selection based on both the separation of groups and also the restriction of \\"external\\" assistance to \\"failing\\" groups from \\"successful\\" ones. This included advocating for \\"educational and voluntary birth control measures\\"—i.e., by separating groups and limiting excessive growth of failing groups.Cattell, R. B. (1972). A New Morality from Science: Beyondism (pp. 95, 221). New York: Pergamon. John Gillis, biographer of Cattell has argued that, although some of Cattell's views are controversial, Tucker and Mehler have exaggerated and misrepresented his views by taking quotes out of context, and by referring back to outdated writings. Magrietha Lotz (2008, p. 136) also says he was taken out of context by his critics. Lotz says \\"the views he developed in the 1930s were common among his contemporaries when beliefs in racial differences were widely held, and should not be distorted by judgment according to today's standards. General scientific observations should not be read as personal moral statements.\\"Lotz, M. A. C. M. (2008).

[Retrieved 12 August 2017] In 1997, Cattell was chosen by the American Psychological Association (APA) for its \\"Gold Medal Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Science of Psychology.\\" Before the medal was presented, Mehler launched a publicity campaign against Cattell through his nonprofit foundation ISAR,ISAR - Beyondist guru to get 1997 Gold Medal at APA accusing Cattell of being sympathetic to racist and fascist ideas.ISAR - R.B. Cattell Homepage Mehler claimed that \\"it is unconscionable to honor this man whose work helps to dignify the most destructive political ideas of the twentieth century\\". A blue-ribbon committee was convened by the APA to investigate the legitimacy of the charges. Before the committee reached a decision, Cattell issued an open letter to the committee saying \\"I abhor racism and discrimination based on race. Any other belief would be antithetical to my life's work\\" and saying that \\"it is unfortunate that the APA announcement ... has brought misguided critics' statements a great deal of publicity.\\"Raymond B. Cattell's Open Letter to the APA Cattell refused the award, withdrawing his name from consideration, and the committee was disbanded. Cattell died months later at the age of 92. In 1984, Cattell said that: \\"The only reasonable thing is to be noncommittal on the race question – that's not the central issue, and it would be a great mistake to be sidetracked into all the emotional upsets that go on in discussions of racial differences. We should be quite careful to dissociate eugenics from it – eugenics' real concern should be with individual differences.\\" Richard L. Gorsuch (1997) wrote (in a letter to the American Psychological Foundation, para. 4) that: \\"The charge of racism is 180 degrees off track. [Cattell] was the first one to challenge the racial bias in tests and to attempt to reduce that problem.\\" Selected publications Raymond Cattell's papers and books are the 7th most highly referenced in peer-reviewed psychology journals over the past century.

Kriminalpolizei (, \\"criminal police\\") is the standard term for the criminal investigation agency within the police forces of Germany, Austria and the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland. In Nazi Germany, the Kripo was the criminal police department for the entire Reich. Today, in the Federal Republic of Germany, the state police (Landespolizei) perform the majority of investigations. Its Criminal Investigation Department is known as the Kriminalpolizei or more colloquially, the Kripo. The equivalent division of the Norwegian Police is known as Kripos, derived from a similar acronym in Norwegian. Foundation In 1799, six police officers were assigned to the Prussian Kammergericht (superior court of justice) in Berlin to investigate more prominent crimes. They were given permission to work in plainclothes, when necessary. Their number increased in the following years. In 1811, their rules of service were written into the Berliner Polizeireglement (Berlin Police Regulations) and in 1820 the rank of Kriminalkommissar was introduced for criminal investigators. In 1872 the new Kriminalpolizei was made a separate branch of police service distinguishing it from the uniformed police called Schutzpolizei. Based on the experience with this new kind of police force, other German states—such as Bremen in 1852—reformed their police forces and by the end of the nineteenth century the Kriminalpolizei had been established nationwide. During the early part of the 20th century and post-World War I, the Kripo continued to serve as the German state's investigative agency for all criminal activity. Nazi Germany After Adolf Hitler assumed national power in January 1933, the Kriminalpolizei came to be under the control of members of the Schutzstaffel (SS). The Nazis began a programme of \\"coordination\\" of all aspects of German life, in order to consolidate their hold on power. In July 1936, the Prussian central criminal investigation department (Landeskriminalpolizeiamt) became the central criminal investigation department for Germany, the Reichskriminalpolizeiamt. It was combined, along with the secret state police, the Geheime Staatspolizei (Gestapo) into two sub-branch departments of the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo). Reinhard Heydrich was in overall command of the SiPo. Arthur Nebe was appointed head of the Reichskriminalpolizeiamt, and reported to Heydrich. In September 1939, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA) was created as the overarching command organization for the various state investigation and security agencies. The SiPo was officially abolished and its departments were folded into the RSHA. The Reichskriminalpolizeiamt became Amt V (Department 5), the Kriminalpolizei (Criminal Police) in the RSHA. Nebe was replaced as commander of the Kripo in August 1944 by Friedrich Panzinger. The Kriminalpolizei were mostly plainclothes detectives and agents, and worked in conjunction with the Gestapo, the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; uniformed police), and the Geheime Feldpolizei. The Kripo was organized in a hierarchical system, with central offices in all towns and smaller cities. These, in turn, answered to headquarters offices in the larger German cities, which answered to Amt V of the RSHA in Berlin. The Kripo was mainly concerned with serious crimes such as rape, murder and arson. A main area of the group's focus was also on \\"blackout burglary,\\" considered a serious problem during bombing raids when criminals would raid abandoned homes, shops and factories for valuables. The Kripo was one of the sources of manpower used to fill the ranks of the Einsatzgruppen and several senior Kripo commanders, Arthur Nebe among them, were assigned as Einsatzgruppen commanders. The Einsatzgruppen's mobile killing units were active in the implementation of the Final Solution, in the territories overrun by the Nazi war machine; which culminated in the Holocaust. Post World War II In 1945, the occupying Allied Powers began their own programme of de-Nazification. It was understood that, in a totalitarian state, few people could participate in public service without also being members of the Nazi Party. Party membership alone was not viewed as sufficient grounds for dismissal, but allegations of involvement or complicity in Nazi war crimes or crimes against humanity were investigated and any police official convicted was sentenced in the usual way. However, the Allied Powers felt the rule of law would be jeopardised by the mass-sacking of police officials who had served the Nazi state and that maintaining the continuity of a civilian and indigenous police force from the outset, together with all its accumulated practical skills and experience, was the most efficient way of restoring democracy to the German people. Thus the Kriminalpolizei adapted once more to the changes in oversight and accountability and, as with other public servants, took the political and economic change of the post-war years in its stride. Present day The Federal Republic of Germany divides police responsibilities between federal and state authorities. The state police or Landespolizei of the federal states perform the majority of investigations in Germany. Within the Landespolizei, the Criminal Investigation Department is known as the Kriminalpolizei or Kripo. The various Kriminalpolizei departments are organized according to state law and report, ultimately, to the Interior Ministry of their state. As the vast majority of police work is performed at state level, the Kriminalpolizei conducts most criminal investigations in Germany. Kriminalpolizei detectives investigate crimes and incidents and work in plainclothes. They collect evidence, interview victims and witnesses and question suspects. Detectives are also involved in the location of missing persons and the recovery of stolen property. Investigators may be assigned to precinct detective squads or one of dozens of specialized investigative units that have borough, citywide or regional jurisdiction. Kripo candidates are mostly regular state police officers who have done well in police school and in their first years of street duty. After rigorous screening and examination, a small number are chosen to receive a technical education in criminology at a police college. Those completing the course then serve a three-year apprenticeship before attaining full status as an investigator. Joint investigation teams are often formed with German Federal Police and customs investigators to combat drug smuggling or organised crime activities. Each state also has a state investigation bureau or Landeskriminalamt, generally located in the state capital, to assist the Kripo in cases that require specialist forensic or investigative resources. German police departments have separate Staatsschutz departments within the Kripo to investigate politically motivated crime. German intelligence agencies have no executive police powers. Their operatives are not authorized to carry out arrests, searches of premises, interrogations or confiscations. If they establish that judicial or police measures are required, they hand the matter over to the courts, public prosecutors or Kripo state security (Staatsschutz) officers who decide independently what action is justified. The Bundeskriminalamt, the German Federal Investigation Bureau, and the federal police, Bundespolizei, have their own investigators but these are not referred to as Kriminalpolizei. It is technically possible to transfer from the federal police to the Kripo, but in practice there is little demand for this. Switzerland The responsibility for law and order in Switzerland basically lies with the cantons where the cantonal police (Kantonspolizei) are responsible for investigations.http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=72#Country_Profile_Section_328 The Swiss federal structure is reflected in a number of cantonal police services which are organized in different ways, but in the German-speaking cantons, the criminal investigation departments are generally known as Kriminalpolizei.

Some feral pigs are hybrids with wild boars. Razorback and wild hog are American colloquialisms, loosely applied to any type of feral domestic pig, wild boar, or hybrid in North America; pure wild boar are sometimes called \\"Russian boar\\" or \\"Russian razorbacks\\". The term \\"razorback\\" has also appeared in Australia, to describe feral pigs there. Definition A feral pig is a domestic pig that has escaped or been released into the wild, and is living more or less as a wild animal, or one that is descended from such animals.Cf. Zoologists generally exclude from the feral category animals that, although captive, were genuinely wild before they escaped. Accordingly, Eurasian wild boar, released or escaped into habitats where they are not native, such as in North America, are not generally considered feral, although they may interbreed with feral pigs. Likewise, reintroduced wild boars in Western Europe are also not considered feral, despite the fact that they were raised in captivity prior to their release In the New World =North America= A family of wild pigs, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Domestic pigs were first introduced to the Americas in the 16th century. Christopher Columbus intentionally released domestic swine in the West Indies during his second voyage to provide future expeditions with a freely available food supply. Hernando de Soto is known to have introduced Eurasian domestic swine to Florida in 1539, although Juan Ponce de León may have introduced the first pigs into mainland Florida in 1521. The practice of introducing domestic pigs into the New World persisted throughout the exploration periods of the 16th and 17th centuries. The Eurasian wild boar (S. s. scrofa), which originally ranged from Great Britain to European Russia, may have also been introduced. By the 19th century, their numbers were sufficient in some areas such as the Southern United States to become a common game animal. Feral pigs are a growing problem in the United States and also on the southern prairies in Canada. As of 2013, the estimated population of 6 million feral pigs causes billions of dollars in property and agricultural damage every year in the United States, both in wild and agricultural lands. Their ecological damage may be equally problematic with 26% lower vertebrate species richness in forest fragments they have invaded. Because pigs forage by rooting for their food under the ground with their snouts and tusks, a sounder (group) of feral pigs can damage acres of planted fields in just a few nights. Because of the feral pig's omnivorous nature, it is a danger to both plants and animals endemic to the area it is invading. Game animals such as deer and turkeys, and more specifically, flora such as the Opuntia plant have been especially affected by the feral hog's aggressive competition for resources. Feral pigs have been determined to be potential hosts for at least 34 pathogens that can be transmitted to livestock, wildlife, and humans. For commercial pig farmers, great concern exists that some of the hogs could be a vector for swine fever to return to the U.S., which has been extinct in America since 1978. Feral pigs could also present an immediate threat to \\"nonbiosecure\\" domestic pig facilities because of their likeliness to harbor and spread pathogens, particularly the protozoan Sarcocystis. By the early 2000s, the range of feral pigs included all of the US south of 36° north. The range begins in the mountains surrounding California and crosses over the mountains, continuing consistently much farther east towards the Louisiana bayous and forests, terminating in the entire Florida peninsula. In the East, the range expands northward to include most of the forested areas and swamps of the Southeast, and from there goes north along the Appalachian Mountains as far as upstate New York, with a growing presence in states bordering West Virginia and Kentucky. Texas has the largest estimated population of 2.5–2.6 million feral pigs existing in 253 of its 254 counties., and they cause about $50 million in agriculture damage per year. Outside mainland US, Hawaii also has feral pigs introduced to Oahu soon after Captain Cook's discovery of Hawaii in 1778, where they prey on or eat endangered birds and plants. The population of feral pigs has increased from 2 million pigs ranging over 20 states in 1990, to triple that number 25 years later, ranging over 38 states with new territories expanding north into Oregon, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Hampshire. Some of these feral pigs have mixed with escaped Russian boars that have been introduced for hunters since the early 1990s. Feral pigs are opportunistic omnivorous, with about 85%-90% of their diet being plant matter, and the remainder animal. Plants have difficulties regenerating from their wallowing, as North American flora did not evolve to withstand the destruction caused by rooting pigs, unlike European or Asian flora. Feral pigs in the US eat small animals, mostly invertebrates like insects and worms but also vertebrates such as wild turkey poults, toads, tortoises, and the eggs of reptiles and birds. This can deprive other wildlife that normally would feed upon these important food sources. In some case, other wildlife are out-competed by the feral pigs' higher reproductive rate; a sow can become pregnant as early as six months old and give birth to multiple litters of piglets yearly. In the autumn, other animals such as the American black bear compete directly with feral pigs as both forage for tree mast (the fruit of forest trees). These are likely reasons that they reduce diversity when they invade. In the US, the problems caused by feral pigs are exacerbated by the small number of species which prey on them. Predators such as bobcats and coyotes may occasionally take feral piglets or weakened animals, but are not large enough to challenge a full- grown boar that can grow to three times their weight. In Florida, feral pigs made up a significant portion of the Florida panther's diet. Other potential predators include the gray wolf, red wolf, cougar, jaguar, American alligator, American black bear, and grizzly bear. Unfortunately, each keystone predator presents problems: the jaguar is extirpated from California and the Southwest. The grizzly bear, while native to most of the American West, is gone from the states that have large feral pig populations, namely Texas, Arizona, California, and New Mexico; and the species also has a very slow reproductive rate. Wolf numbers are small and expected to remain so as they slowly repopulate their range; only a few individuals thus far have been recorded as inhabiting California, in spite of thousands of square miles of good habitat. The cougar is present in most of the West, but is gone from the East, with no known populations east of Minnesota in the north, and very thin numbers east of Houston in the South. The American black bear is both predator and competitor, but in most areas probably may not impact feral pig populations enough to control them. Programs do exist to protect the weakened numbers of large predators in the US, but it is expected to take a very long time for these animals to naturally repopulate their former habitat. Hunting in the United States A hunted wild pig Feral pigs being shot from a helicopter, Texas Wildlife Services A corral-type trap being baited. Food is left to accustom pigs to using the trap as a daily food source; eventually, the gate can be triggered remotely when most or all the members of a sounder are inside the trap To control feral pig numbers, American hunters have taken to trapping and killing as many individuals as they can. Some, in Texas, have even turned the trapping and killing of razorbacks into small businesses. The meat of wild pigs may be suitable for human consumption; around 461,000 animals killed in Texas between 2004 and 2009 were federally inspected and commercially sold for consumption. Legal restrictions on methods of hunting are lax, as most state departments of wildlife openly acknowledge feral pigs as an ecological threat and some classify them as vermin. For example, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers them unprotected wild animals with no closed season or harvest limit, and promotes their aggressive removal. Shooting pigs from a helicopter is legal in Texas, and can be an effective method, killing as many as 9 to 27 animals per hour. However, helicopters can cost from US$400 to US$1000 per hour to operate. These costs are defrayed by selling seats on these helicopter flights to recreational hunters; Texas law only requires that those buying a helicopter hunt be in possession of a hunting license. The method relies on the helicopter flushing pigs into the open where they can be targeted. In some areas, such as the Piney Woods, this may not be possible because of vegetation. Hunting with dogs is permitted and very common; it has been practiced in the Southeast for generations. Competitions for producing the fastest bay dogs are prevalent in the South, with Uncle Earl's Hog Dog Trials in Louisiana a popular example, held every summer since 1995. Preferred scent dogs for catching feral pigs mostly are native breeds, and include the Catahoula Leopard Dog, the Blue Lacy, all of the Coonhound breeds, the Plott Hound, and the Blackmouth Cur; catch dogs typically are American Pit Bull Terriers and their crosses, and American Bulldogs. The method of hunting has little variation: usually, the hunter sends out bay dogs trained to chase the pig until it tires and then corner it; then a bigger catch dog is sent out to catch and hold down the pig, which may get aggressive, until the hunter arrives to kill it. No single management technique alone can be totally effective at controlling feral pig populations. Harvesting 66% of the total population per year is required to keep the Texas feral pig populations stable. Best management practices suggest the use of corral traps which have the ability to capture the entire sounder of feral pigs. The federal government spends $20 million on feral pig management. In February 2017, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller approved the use of a pesticide called Kaput Feral Hog Lure, which is bait food laced with warfarin (a rodenticide used to kill rodents). =South America= In South America, during the early 20th century, free-ranging boars were introduced in Uruguay for hunting purposes and eventually crossed the border into Brazil in the 1990s, quickly becoming an invasive species. Licensed private hunting of both feral boars and their hybrids with domestic pigs was authorized from August 2005 on in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, although their presence as a pest had been already noticed by the press as early as 1994. Releases and escapes from unlicensed farms (established because of increased demand for boar meat as an alternative to pork), however, continued to bolster feral populations, and by mid-2008, licensed hunts had to be expanded to the states of Santa Catarina and São Paulo. Recently established Brazilian boar populations are not to be confused with long-established populations of feral domestic pigs, which have existed mainly in the Pantanal for more than 100 years, along with native peccaries. The demographic dynamics of the interaction between feral pig populations and those of the two native species of peccaries (collared peccary and white-lipped peccary) is obscure and is still being studied. The existence of feral pigs could somewhat ease jaguar predation on peccary populations, as jaguars show a preference for hunting pigs when they are available. Australia A feral pig in a back yard in Brisbane, Australia, 2009 Distribution of feral pigs in Australia The first recorded release of pigs in Australia was made by Captain James Cook at Adventure Bay, Bruny Island in 1777. This was part of his policy of introducing animals and plants to newly discovered countries. He \\"carried them (a boar and sow) about a mile within the woods at the head of the bay and there left them by the side of a fresh water brook\\". The deliberate introduction of pigs into previously pig-free areas seems to have been common. As recently as the early 1970s, pigs were introduced to Babel Island, off the east coast of Flinders Island. These pigs were eradicated by Department of Agriculture staff with local assistance. One common story about the feral pig population on Flinders Island is that pigs were released when the ship City of Foo Chow went ashore on the northeast coast of the island in March 1877. On Flinders Island, feral pigs usually invade agricultural areas adjacent to the national park and east-coast swamps. Farmers consider damage caused by the pigs to be minor, as it is restricted to rooting in pasture adjacent to scrub- land edges. The total pasture area damaged each year is estimated to be less than 50 hectares. Feral pigs are reported to visit paddocks where ewes are lambing, but no lambs being killed have been reported. However, pigs, being omnivores, may scavenge any carcasses left near the scrub-land. In the Strzelecki National Park on the island, the ecosystem has been severely damaged; extensive rooting in the gullies led to water erosion and loss of regenerating forest plants. Bracken fern (Pteridium esculentum) flourishes in this damaged environment and dominates large areas forming dense stands to about 4 m which prevent light reaching the forest floor. Since 1987, feral pigs have been considered to be the most important mammalian pest of Australian agriculture. In the UK The natural habitats of wild boar are woodlands; however, feral populations root and forage in areas where they conflict with human activities, such as in picnic areas, on golf courses, football pitches, village greens, etc.Wild boar invade football pitch This is Gloucestershire, November 10, 2008. In the UK, wild boar can be farmed under licence. However, to release them into the wild is illegal. Established populations of wild boar occur in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. These are often active during the daytime (diurnal behavior) and are less wary of people. This is in contrast to populations in East Sussex, which are nocturnal and wary of people. Groups of wild boar have been reported in the Scottish Highlands including Invermoriston, near Loch Ness, and between Newtonmore and Laggan. A group, believed to be a mix of wild boar and domestic pig that escaped from a farm, have been seen in the Strathnairn area near Inverness. Wild boar occur elsewhere in the UK according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It said between 100 and 200 were estimated to be in Kent and East Sussex, and about 20–30 in West Dorset.  Fatal attacks on human beings  Feral pigs can be extremely dangerous to people, particularly when the pigs travel in herds with their young, and should be avoided when possible. Feral pigs living in the United States have been known to attack without provocation and fatally injure human beings. There have been over 100 documented attacks by feral pigs on human beings in the United States between the years 1825 and 2012. Of these attacks, five have been fatal. Three of the five fatal attacks were by feral pigs wounded by hunters. Both male and female feral pigs are known to attack without provocation, and attacks by solitary males, as well as group attacks have been documented.Wild pig attacks on humans, University of Nebraska, Lincoln Peer Reviewed Study On November 26, 2019, a 59-year-old Texas woman named Christine Rollins was attacked and killed only a few feet away from the front door of her workplace by a herd of feral pigs in the town of Anahuac, Texas, which is 50 miles east of Houston. This incident was the fifth documented fatal feral pig attack in the United States since 1825. Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne in a formal statement to news media stated that \\"multiple hogs\\" assaulted Rollins during pre-dawn hours between 6 and 6:30 a.m. when it was still dark outside. The victim died of blood loss as a result of her injuries.

It is also applied by emergency personnel to those who have had traumatic head or neck injuries, and can be used to treat chronic medical conditions. Whenever people have a traumatic head or neck injury, they may have a cervical fracture. This makes them at high risk for spinal cord injury, which could be exacerbated by movement of the person and could lead to paralysis or death. A common scenario for this injury would be a person suspected of having whiplash because of a car accident. In order to prevent further injury, such people may have a collar placed by medical professionals until X-rays can be taken to determine if a cervical spine fracture exists. The cervical collar only stabilizes the top seven vertebrae, C1 through C7. (Other immobilizing devices such as a Kendrick Extrication Device or a backboard can be used to stabilize the remainder of the spinal column.) The routine use of a cervical collar by a first aid provider is not recommended. Cervical collars are also used therapeutically to help realign the spinal cord and relieve pain, although they are usually not worn for long periods of time. Another use of the cervical collar is for strains, sprains or whiplash. If pain is persistent, the collar might be required to remain attached to help in the healing process. A person may also need a cervical collar, or may require a halo fixation device to support the neck during recovery after surgery such as cervical spinal fusion. Types A neck collar being placed on a patient by emergency services. A soft collar is fairly flexible and is the least limiting but can carry a high risk of further breakage, especially in people with osteoporosis. It can be used for minor injuries or after healing has allowed the neck to become more stable. A range of manufactured rigid collars are also used, usually comprising (a) a firm plastic bi-valved shell secured with Velcro straps and (b) removable padded liners. The most frequently prescribed are the Aspen, Malibu, Miami J, and Philadelphia collars. All these can be used with additional chest and head extension pieces to increase stability. Cervical collars are incorporated into rigid braces that constrain the head and chest together.. Examples include the Sterno-Occipital Mandibular Immobilization Device (SOMI), Lerman Minerva and Yale types. Special cases, such as very young children or non-cooperative adults, are sometimes still immobilized in medical plaster of paris casts, such as the Minerva cast. Use over time As a result of several randomized clinical trials over the last decade, hospitals and ambulance staff have seen a significant reduction in the number of patients that are being immobilized. This has been due to complications such as increased intracranial pressure with traumatic brain injury, along with access issues for airway management in obtunded patients. Some medical professionals have even been calling for a ban on cervical collars, stating that they cause more harm than good. There is also very little evidence that shows cervical collars to be actually making a difference in traumatic cervical spine injury. Sport A motocross rider wearing a sports neck brace In high-risk motorsports such as Motocross, go-kart racing and speed-boat racing, racers often wear a protective collar to avoid whiplash and other neck injuries.

Biography Born on a New Hampshire farm on July 20, 1850, Shedd arrived in Chicago, Illinois in 1871 and began working as a stock clerk for Marshall Field. By 1901, he had worked his way up to a vice-presidency and took over as president upon Field's death in 1906. Field himself described Shedd as \\"the greatest merchant in the United States,\\" and, indeed, under Shedd's presidency Marshall Field & Company became the largest store in Chicago and the largest wholesale and dry goods company in the world. Shedd was a civic leader and founding member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, which continues to play an active role in the city's efforts to maintain itself as a world-class metropolis. One of the Commercial Club's most notable undertakings was the sponsorship of Edward Bennett and Daniel Burnham's Plan of Chicago, which was released in 1909 and which to this day is considered to be one of the most important urban planning documents ever created. One of Chicago's major philanthropists, he contributed extensively to Chicago charities, universities and museums, and in the early 1920s he provided $3 million to build Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, as a complement to The Field Museum (founded in 1893 as a part of the World's Columbian Exposition and renamed in honor of Marshall Field in 1905) and The Art Institute of Chicago (whose current building was also a product of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition). Completed in 1930, the Shedd Aquarium remained the world's largest aquarium for most of the century. In 1920, Shedd provided the funds for the construction of the Shedd-Porter Memorial Library in Alstead, New Hampshire. He died of appendicitis in Chicago on October 22, 1926. Legacy In 2002, The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts, a community-based performing arts center and music school in Eugene, Oregon, was co-founded by one of his great-grandchildren. With his wife, Mary Roanna (née Porter) (1863–1942), they had daughters Helen Shedd Reed Keith and Laura Abbie Shedd Schweppe (? – 1937). Laura married Charles Hodgdon Schweppe (1881–1941) in 1913. His grandson John Shedd Reed was president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway from 1967 to 1986 as well as president of the Shedd Aquarium from 1984 to 1994.

If a system is BIBO stable, then the output will be bounded for every input to the system that is bounded. A signal is bounded if there is a finite value B > 0 such that the signal magnitude never exceeds B, that is :\\\\ y[n] \\\\leq B \\\\quad \\\\forall n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} for discrete-time signals, or :\\\\ y(t) \\\\leq B \\\\quad \\\\forall t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} for continuous-time signals.  Time-domain condition for linear time-invariant systems =Continuous- time necessary and sufficient condition= For a continuous time linear time- invariant (LTI) system, the condition for BIBO stability is that the impulse response, h(t) , be absolutely integrable, i.e., its L1 norm exists. : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth(t)\\\\right\\\\,\\\\mathord{\\\\operatorname{d}}t = \\\\ h \\\\_1 < \\\\infty =Discrete-time sufficient condition= For a discrete time LTI system, the condition for BIBO stability is that the impulse response be absolutely summable, i.e., its \\\\ell^1 norm exists. :\\\\ \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h[n] = \\\\ h \\\\_1 < \\\\infty Proof of sufficiency Given a discrete time LTI system with impulse response \\\\ h[n] the relationship between the input \\\\ x[n] and the output \\\\ y[n] is :\\\\ y[n] = h[n] * x[n] where * denotes convolution. Then it follows by the definition of convolution :\\\\ y[n] = \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h[k] x[n-k] Let \\\\ x \\\\_{\\\\infty} be the maximum value of \\\\ x[n], i.e., the L_{\\\\infty}-norm. :\\\\lefty[n]\\\\right = \\\\left\\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h[n-k] x[k]\\\\right ::\\\\le \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[n-k]\\\\right \\\\leftx[k]\\\\right (by the triangle inequality) : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\le \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[n-k]\\\\right \\\\ x \\\\_\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\ x \\\\_{\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[n-k]\\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\ x \\\\_{\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[k]\\\\right \\\\end{align} If h[n] is absolutely summable, then \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}{\\\\lefth[k]\\\\right} = \\\\ h \\\\_1 < \\\\infty and :\\\\ x \\\\_\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[k]\\\\right = \\\\ x \\\\_\\\\infty \\\\ h \\\\_1 So if h[n] is absolutely summable and \\\\leftx[n]\\\\right is bounded, then \\\\lefty[n]\\\\right is bounded as well because \\\\ x \\\\_{\\\\infty} \\\\ h \\\\_1 < \\\\infty. The proof for continuous-time follows the same arguments.  Frequency-domain condition for linear time- invariant systems = Continuous-time signals = For a rational and continuous-time system, the condition for stability is that the region of convergence (ROC) of the Laplace transform includes the imaginary axis. When the system is causal, the ROC is the open region to the right of a vertical line whose abscissa is the real part of the \\"largest pole\\", or the pole that has the greatest real part of any pole in the system. The real part of the largest pole defining the ROC is called the abscissa of convergence. Therefore, all poles of the system must be in the strict left half of the s-plane for BIBO stability. This stability condition can be derived from the above time-domain condition as follows: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth(t)\\\\right \\\\, dt & = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth(t)\\\\right \\\\left e^{-j \\\\omega t }\\\\right \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth(t) (1 \\\\cdot e)^{-j \\\\omega t} \\\\right \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth(t) (e^{\\\\sigma + j \\\\omega})^{- t} \\\\right \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth(t) e^{-s t} \\\\right \\\\, dt \\\\end{align} where s = \\\\sigma + j \\\\omega and \\\\operatorname{Re}(s) = \\\\sigma = 0. The region of convergence must therefore include the imaginary axis. = Discrete-time signals = For a rational and discrete time system, the condition for stability is that the region of convergence (ROC) of the z-transform includes the unit circle. When the system is causal, the ROC is the open region outside a circle whose radius is the magnitude of the pole with largest magnitude. Therefore, all poles of the system must be inside the unit circle in the z-plane for BIBO stability. This stability condition can be derived in a similar fashion to the continuous-time derivation: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{n = -\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[n]\\\\right & = \\\\sum_{n = -\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[n]\\\\right \\\\left e^{-j \\\\omega n} \\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{n = -\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[n] (1 \\\\cdot e)^{-j \\\\omega n} \\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =\\\\sum_{n = -\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[n] (r e^{j \\\\omega})^{-n} \\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{n = -\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lefth[n] z^{- n} \\\\right \\\\end{align} where z = r e^{j \\\\omega} and r = z = 1.

Commonly carried on ambulances, the K.E.D. is typically applied by an emergency medical technician, paramedic, or another first responder. Typically used in conjunction with a cervical collar, the K.E.D. is a semi-rigid brace that secures the head, neck and torso in an anatomically neutral position. This position reduces the possibility of additional injuries to these regions during extrication. The original K.E.D. was designed by Richard Kendrick in 1978.K.E.D. Patent http://www.google.sc/patents/US4211218 Description Typically there are two head straps, three torso straps, and two legs straps which are used to adequately secure the K.E.D. to the victim. Unlike a long spine board or litter, the K.E.D. uses a series of wooden or polymer bars in a nylon jacket, allowing the responders to immobilize the neck and upper spine and remove the victim from the vehicle or other confined space. Although the K.E.D. can also be used to immobilize infants and children, it is preferable to use specifically designed pediatric immobilization devices whenever possible. If the K.E.D. is used to immobilize an infant or child, appropriate padding must be used to ensure complete immobilization in a manner that does not obscure the thorax and abdomen, thereby preventing continued assessment of these vital areas. Application The device can be quickly and easily inserted into the seat of a vehicle by a single rescuer, allows access to the airway and conforms to any body size. The K.E.D. is typically used only on hemodynamically stable victims; unstable victims are extricated using rapid extrication techniques without the prior application of the K.E.D. Once the K.E.D. is slid into position, it is secured to the victim with straps in order to prevent movement. The first strap that is secured is the middle torso strap. According to the K.E.D. users' manual securing this strap secures the greatest area of the device and therefore provides the greatest stability while securing the rest of the device. Next the bottom torso strap is secured, however the top torso strap is not secured until just prior to moving the patient to the long spine board. This is to allow the patient to breathe easily while the rest of the device is secured. Following the bottom torso strap the leg straps are secured. These may be applied in a \\"criss-cross\\" fashion (according to the K.E.D. users' manual this is the most commonly used method), or applied by securing them to their respective sides. If there is any evidence of a groin injury the \\"criss-cross\\" method cannot be used. Following application of the leg straps the void between the head and device is padded as needed and the head is secured. Finally, just prior to moving the patient to a long spine board the top strap is secured.K.E.D. Users' Manual https://co.grand.co.us/DocumentCenter/View/681 Some schools teach this order by remembering the phrase \\"My Baby Looks Hot Tonight”, where the beginning of each word stands for Middle torso strap, Bottom torso strap, Leg straps, Head strap and Top torso strap. The head pad can bring the head too far forward for the side panels to fully immobilize it. Care must be taken to secure the head properly to maintain neutral immobilization. If the head is too far forward, the head is brought back to meet the K.E.D. unless crepitus, pain or resistance is met. If these symptoms are present, the head is immobilized in the position found. It is worth noting that there is debate and controversy surrounding the exact order of applying the torso straps, with some saying that the order does not matter, as long as the torso is secured before the head. The K.E.D. users' manual is sometimes used in this justification with the explanation that it states the reason the top strap is last is a function of breathing, and not the process of immobilization itself.K.E.D User's Manual, 2001, p. 11 https://co.grand.co.us/DocumentCenter/View/681 There is further controversy about whether the KED still has a place in prehospital care . Rapid extrication During rapid extrication, the patient is not immobilized by a K.E.D., but rather taken directly out of the car onto a back board. Reasons for using this technique include: *The scene is unsafe *The patient's condition is unstable *The patient is blocking access to another victim.\\"Rapid Extrication\\".

History and profile Der Standard was founded by Oscar Bronner as a financial newspaper and published its first edition on 19 October 1988. German media company Axel Springer acquired a stake in the paper in 1988 and sold it in 1995. Bronner remains the paper's publisher, Martin Kotynek is editor-in-chief. Der Standard sees itself as—in a Continental European sense (socially and culturally, but not economically)—liberal and independent. Third parties have described the paper as having a left-liberal stance. Until 2007, the editor-in-chief of the daily was Gerfried Sperl, Alexandra Föderl-Schmid succeeded him in the post. In 2002 the paper was one of four quality daily newspapers with nationwide distribution along with Salzburger Nachrichten, Die Presse, and Wiener Zeitung. Although Der Standard is intended to be a national paper, in the past it had an undeniable tendency to focus on Vienna. This has been mitigated by having editorial offices in other federal states (currently Styria, Upper Austria and Carinthia) and the introduction of regional sections. Der Standard is a paper from which foreign media readily quote when an opinion from the Austrian press is required. It is one of Austria's best-selling quality newspapers and on 18 June 2005 celebrated its 5000th edition. Der Standard is published in accordance with the honour code of the Austrian press (which sets rules on matters such as a transparent division between news and comment and the right to privacy). The paper's general editorial stance could be described as socially liberal and most of its regular columnists also tend to this position, although guest writers come from a wide variety of political positions. As a participant in Project Syndicate Der Standard also regularly publishes commentary from individuals with an international reputation, whose work has worldwide distribution as part of this project. Der Standard is published by the Standard Verlagsgesellschaft m. b. H. In August 2008, the newly created Bronner Online AG bought 49% of the shares of this company, which Süddeutscher Verlag previously owned. The Bronner Family Foundation has long owned 41% of the shares, and Oskar Bronner himself owns the remaining 10%. Süddeutscher Verlag had bought into the company in December 1998; previously, between 1988 and April 1995, Axel Springer Verlag had owned 50% of the shares. Since 2005, the paper has cooperated with The New York Times and has published The New York Times International Weekly on Mondays, which is a six-page supplement, featuring select articles from the Times in English. Der Standard participates in Atomium Culture, the Permanent Platform for European Excellence that brings together some of the most authoritative European universities, newspapers and businesses to increase the movement of knowledge: across borders, across sectors and to the public at large. According to the 2007 Austrian Media Analysis, Der Standard has 352,000 readers in Austria, a 5% share of all readers. With a share of 19.4%, the paper is the most widely read newspaper among people with college or university education. A full online edition (Der Standard digital) is available as an e-paper on a subscription-basis. Circulation The circulation of Der Standard was 104,000 copies in 2002. In 2004 its circulation was 106,000 copies. The paper had a circulation of 118,000 copies in 2007. The circulation of the paper was 117,131 copies in 2008 and 108,772 copies in 2009. It was 104,004 copies in 2010. The paper had a circulation of 72,693 copies in 2011. The circulation of the paper was about 86,000 copies in 2013. derStandard.at Der Standard has run its own web portal—derStandard.at—since February 1995 and claims this was the first appearance of a German-language newspaper on the web. In Q4 of 2011, according to Die Österreichische Webanalyse, derstandard.at had a readership of 1,135,000 unique users (2,379,231 unique clients in December 2011) and is consequently one of the largest and most wide-ranging web portals in Austria. Articles published online can be commented on by registered users. The portal diestandard.at publishes articles on women's issues and feminism. In 2011, derStandard.at yielded a higher profit than the print edition of Der Standard.

Hollerith punched card The tabulating machine was an electromechanical machine designed to assist in summarizing information stored on punched cards. Invented by Herman Hollerith, the machine was developed to help process data for the 1890 U.S. Census. Later models were widely used for business applications such as accounting and inventory control. It spawned a class of machines, known as unit record equipment, and the data processing industry. The term \\"Super Computing\\" was used by the New York World newspaper in 1931 to refer to a large custom-built tabulator that IBM made for Columbia University. The 1920 date on page 95 is incorrect, see The Columbia Difference Tabulator - 1931 1890 census The 1880 census had taken eight years to process.U.S. Census, 1880#Results Since the U.S. Constitution mandates a census every ten years to apportion both congressional representatives and direct taxes among the states, a combination of larger staff and faster-recording systems was required. In the late 1880s Herman Hollerith, inspired by conductors using holes punched in different positions on a railway ticket to record traveler details such as gender and approximate age, invented the recording of data on a machine-readable medium. Prior uses of machine-readable media had been for lists of instructions (not data) to drive programmed machines such as Jacquard looms. \\"After some initial trials with paper tape, he settled on punched cards...\\" Hollerith used punched cards with round holes, 12 rows, and 24 columns. The cards measured 3-1/4 inches by 6-5/8 inches. His tabulator used electromechanical solenoids to increment mechanical counters. A set of spring-loaded wires were suspended over the card reader. The card sat over pools of mercury, pools corresponding to the possible hole positions in the card. When the wires were pressed onto the card, punched holes allowed wires to dip into the mercury pools, making an electrical contactHollerith 1890 Census Tabulator Columbia University Computing History that could be used for counting, sorting, and setting off a bell to let the operator know the card had been read. The tabulator had 40 counters, each with a dial divided into 100 divisions, with two indicator hands; one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse, the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution. This arrangement allowed a count of up to 9,999. During a given tabulating run, counters could be assigned to a specific hole or, by using relay logic, to a combination of holes, e.g. to count married females. If the card was to be sorted, a compartment lid of the sorting box would open for storage of the card, the choice of compartment depending on the data in the card. Hollerith's method was used for the 1890 census. Clerks used keypunches to punch holes in the cards entering age, state of residence, gender, and other information from the returns. Some 100 million cards were generated and \\"the cards were only passed through the machines four times during the whole of the operations.\\"* According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the census results were \\"... finished months ahead of schedule and far under budget.\\" Following the 1890 census The advantages of the technology were immediately apparent for accounting and tracking inventory. Hollerith started his own business as The Hollerith Electric Tabulating System, specializing in punched card data processing equipment. In 1896 he incorporated the Tabulating Machine Company. In that year he introduced the Hollerith Integrating Tabulator, which could add numbers coded on punched cards, not just count the number of holes. Punched cards were still read manually using the pins and mercury pool reader. 1900 saw the Hollerith Automatic Feed Tabulator used in that year's U.S. census. A control panel was incorporated in the 1906 Type 1. In 1911, four corporations, including Hollerith's firm, were amalgamated (via stock acquisition) to form a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). The Powers Accounting Machine Company was formed that same year and, like Hollerith, with machines first developed at the Census Bureau. In 1919 the first Bull tabulator prototype was developed. Tabulators that could print, and with removable control panels, appeared in the 1920s. In 1924 CTR was renamed International Business Machines (IBM). In 1927 Remington Rand acquired the Powers Accounting Machine Company. In 1933 The Tabulating Machine Company was subsumed into IBM. These companies continued to develop faster and more sophisticated tabulators, culminating in tabulators such as 1949 IBM 407 and 1952 Remington Rand 409. Tabulating machines continued to be used well after the introduction of commercial electronic computers in the 1950s. Many applications using unit record tabulators were migrated to computers such as the IBM 1401. Two programming languages, FARGO and RPG, were created to aid this migration. Since tabulator control panels were based on the machine cycle, both FARGO and RPG emulated the notion of the machine cycle and training material showed the control panel vs. programming language coding sheet relationships. Operation IBM Type 285 tabulators in use at U.S. Social Security Administration circa 1936Early IBM tabulating machine Powers- Samas accounting machine In its basic form, a tabulating machine would read one card at a time, print portions (fields) of the card on fan-fold paper, possibly rearranged, and add one or more numbers punched on the card to one or more counters, called accumulators. On early models, the accumulator register dials would be read manually after a card run to get totals. Later models could print totals directly. Cards with a particular punch could be treated as master cards causing different behavior. For example, customer master cards could be merged with sorted cards recording individual items purchased. When read by the tabulating machine to create invoices, the billing address and customer number would be printed from the master card, and then individual items purchased and their price would be printed. When the next master card was detected, the total price would be printed from the accumulator and the page ejected to the top of the next page, typically using a carriage control tape. With successive stages or cycles of punched-card processing, fairly complex calculations could be made if one had a sufficient set of equipment. (In modern data processing terms, one can think of each stage as an SQL clause: SELECT (filter columns), then WHERE (filter cards, or \\"rows\\"), then maybe a GROUP BY for totals and counts, then a SORT BY; and then perhaps feed those back to another set of SELECT and WHERE cycles again if needed.) A human operator had to retrieve, load, and store the various card decks at each stage. Selected Models and timeline Hollerith's first tabulators were used for the U.S. 1890 Census. The first Tabulating Machine Company (TMC) automatic feed tabulator, operating at 150 cards/minute, was developed in 1906. The first TMC printing tabulator was developed in 1920.

Born in Albany County, New York,\\"Death of Potter Palmer\\" in The New York Times, May 5, 1902, p. 9. he was the fourth son of Benjamin and Rebecca (Potter) Palmer.\\"Potter Palmer.\\" Dictionary of American Biography. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936. Biography in Context. Web. 30 Apr. 2014. Retailing career Potter Palmer founded a dry goods store, Potter Palmer and Company, on Lake Street in Chicago in 1852. Unlike many stores of the time it focused on women and encouraged their patronage. Palmer instituted a \\"no questions asked\\" returns policy and allowed customers to take goods home to inspect before purchasing, which served to nurture the goodwill and patronage of Chicagoans. He made the store much larger and more distinctive than other stores of the time. Palmer was the first owner to advertise with large window displays that included price comparisons. When Palmer's doctor urged him to get out of the business in 1865 because of ill health, he brought in partners Marshall Field and Levi Leiter. The trio joined forces and renamed the firm Field, Palmer, Leiter and Company. The store would eventually develop into the prominent Midwestern department store chain Marshall Field and Company. Real estate career Bust of Potter Palmer by Hiram Powers, 1871 (Art Institute of Chicago) In 1865, Palmer went to his doctor complaining of being overworked and stressed. His doctor advised him to retire from actively managing his store at the age of 38. In 1867, Palmer sold his share of the partnership and went on vacation in Europe for three years before returning to Chicago to focus his efforts on his real estate interests, leasing a new building to his former partners in 1868 at State and Washington. He built several buildings along State Street \\"on three-fourths of a mile frontage,\\" including the Palmer House Hotel. New York Observer, May 8, 1902 When his buildings were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire, Palmer borrowed $1.7 million to rebuild, the largest amount lent to a private individual up to that time. He reclaimed the swampland north of Chicago's commercial district, developing it into Lake Shore Drive. Potter Palmer also moved the city's main commercial district from Lake Street, which ran east and west, to State Street, which ran north and south, parallel with the lake the way Chicago's downtown is currently oriented. Potter Palmer is also responsible for widening State Street. Personal life Photochrom print of Palmer Mansion in 1900. In 1871, he married Bertha Honoré. In 1874 a son, Honoré, was born; in 1875, Potter Palmer II. Both went on to have sons named Potter Palmer III, as well as other children. Who's Who in Chicago, 1931 In 1885 Palmer built the castle-like Palmer Mansion on Lake Shore Drive, leading to the establishment of the Gold Coast. Prior to that time, Prairie Avenue had been the most desirable address in Chicago. Palmer is buried in Graceland Cemetery in the north side neighborhood, known today as Uptown, Chicago.

Thomas Coryat (also Coryate) (c. 1577 – 1617) was an English traveller and writer of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean age. He is principally remembered for two volumes of writings he left regarding his travels, often on foot, through Europe and parts of Asia. He is often credited with introducing the table fork to England, with \\"Furcifer\\" (Latin: fork-bearer, rascal) becoming one of his nicknames.Michael Strachan, \\"Coryate, Thomas (c. 1577–1617)\\", in Literature of Travel and Exploration: an Encyclopedia, 2003, Volume 1, pp.285–87 His description of how the Italians shielded themselves from the sun resulted in the word \\"umbrella\\" being introduced into English. Life and writings Title page of Coryat's Crudities, 1611. Coryat was born in Crewkerne, Somerset, and lived most of his life in the Somerset village of Odcombe. He was a son of George Coryate (d. 1607). He was educated at Winchester College from 1591, and at Gloucester Hall, Oxford from 1596 to 1599. He was employed by Prince Henry, eldest son of James I as a sort of \\"court jester\\" from 1603 to 1607, alongside Ben Jonson, John Donne and Inigo Jones. From May to October 1608 he undertook a tour of Europe, somewhat less than half of which he walked. He travelled through France and Italy to Venice, and returned via Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. He published his memoirs of the events in a volume entitled Coryat's Crudities hastily gobbled up in Five Months Travels in France, Italy, &c;' (1611). This volume gives a vivid picture of life in Europe during the time.http://www.oshermaps.org/exhibitions/grand-tour-and- tourism-1600-1900/i-the-first-tourist-1611-thomas-coryat The work is particularly important to music historians for giving extraordinary details of the activities of the Venetian School, one of the most famous and progressive contemporary musical movements in Europe, including an elaborate description of the festivities at the church of San Rocco in Venice, with polychoral and instrumental music by Giovanni Gabrieli, Bartolomeo Barbarino, and others. In 1611 he published a second volume of travel writings, this one entitled Coryats Crambe, or his Coleworte twice Sodden. Coryat's letters from this time refer to the famous Mermaid Tavern in London, and mention Ben Jonson, John Donne and other members of a drinking club \\"Fraternity of Sireniacal Gentlemen\\" that met there.O'Callaghan, Michelle, \\"Patrons of the Mermaid tavern (act. 1611)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Accessed 30 Nov 2014. Ever restless, he set out once again in 1612, this time on a journey that would ultimately lead to Asia, visiting Greece, the eastern Mediterranean including Constantinople by 1614, and walking through Turkey, Persia and eventually Moghul India by 1615, visiting the Emperor Jahangir's court in Ajmer, Rajasthan. From Agra and elsewhere he sent letters describing his experiences; his Greetings from the Court of the Great Mogul was published in London in 1616, and a similar volume of his letters home appeared posthumously in 1618. In September 1617, at the invitation of Sir Thomas Roe, he visited the imperial court at Mandu, Madhya Pradesh. In November 1617 he left for Surat; he died of dysentery there in December of that year, his demise hastened by the consumption of sack. Though his planned account of the journey was never to be, some of his unorganized travel notes have survived and found their way back to England. These were published in the 1625 edition of Samuel Purchas's Coryat's writings were hugely popular at the time. His accounts of inscriptions, many of which are now lost, were valuable; and his accounts of Italian customs and manners—including the use of the table fork—were influential in England at a time when other aspects of Italian culture, such as the madrigal, had already been in vogue for more than twenty years. He is considered by many to have been the first Briton to do a Grand Tour of Europe; a practice which became a mainstay of the education of upper class Englishmen in the 18th century. Legacy thumb The place of his tomb is uncertain. As there was no regular English cemetery at Surat then, his body was buried north of the town on the western side of road leading to Bharuch. Another traveller Terry noted that his body was buried at Swally (Suvali) where other English are also buried but this account is not reliable as it was written 40 years after the death. The List of Tombs and Monuments in the Bombay Presidency had described it as 'consisting of a dome resting on circular pillars' in Muslim architectural style which is similar to a monument present at Rajgari near Suvali. This monument is now State Protected Monument identifying it as the tomb of Tom Coryat (S-GJ-231). There is no inscription or other clue supporting it as the tomb; however, it is known that the tomb had just two marked stones originally and there is no known reason why a monument was erected later. Thomas Herbert, who visited India ten years after the death of Coryat, noted that a Persian ambassador, who died on board the fleet at Swally, was buried near him in Surat. Dr. John Fryer who was at Surat in 1675 was shown the tombs of the Persian ambassador and Coryat, along with several Armenian Christian tombs outside the Bharuch gate. The original location of the gate is not known, as the old mud wall fort was replaced by a brick wall fort after the Battle of Surat. During the British period, William Morrison, the collector of Surat tried to find the tomb but later concluded that it is lost in the periodical floods of the Tapi river. British travel writer and historian William Dalrymple cites Coryat as 'one of my travel-writing heroes' in his first book In Xanadu (1989). British travel writer and humorist Tim Moore retraced the steps of Coryat's tour of Europe, as recounted in his book Continental Drifter (2000). In 2008 Daniel Allen published an account of his nine-month cycle trip following Coryate's journey to the East, entitled The Sky Above, The Kingdom Below. Lonely Planet founder Tony Wheeler spoke at the Australian Festival of Travel Writing about Thomas Coryat. Wheeler traced Coryate’s journey as he observed the invention of leisure travel. He visited his supposed tomb at Rajgari near Surat in 2010. See also *John Sandford (poet) *William Stansby Notes References and further reading *Adams, Percy G.

Hutton and starring Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood, and Mary Ure. It was distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, filmed in Panavision, and shot on location in Austria and Bavaria. Alistair MacLean wrote the screenplay, his first, at the same time that he wrote the novel of the same name. Both became commercial successes. The film involved some of the top filmmakers of the day and is now considered a classic. Major contributors included Hollywood stuntman Yakima Canutt, who as second-unit director shot most of the action scenes; British stuntman Alf Joint who doubled for Burton in such sequences as the fight on top of the cable car; award-winning conductor and composer Ron Goodwin, who wrote the film score; and future Oscar-nominee Arthur Ibbetson, who worked on its cinematography. Plot In the winter of 1943–44, U.S. Army Brigadier General George Carnaby (Robert Beatty), a chief planner for the Western Front, is captured by the Germans. He is taken for interrogation to Schloß Adler (Hohenwerfen Castle), a mountaintop fortress accessible only by cable car. A team of seven Allied commandos, led by British Major John Smith of the Grenadier Guards (Richard Burton) and U.S. Army Ranger Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), is briefed by Colonel Turner (Patrick Wymark) and Vice Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern) of MI6. Disguised as German troops, they are to parachute in, enter the castle, and rescue General Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him. After their Ju 52 transport plane drops them into Germany, Smith secretly meets Mary Ellison (Mary Ure) with whom it's implied he is in a relationship and Heidi Schmidt (Ingrid Pitt), their presence known only to him; Heidi arranges for Mary to be a secretary at the castle. Although two of the team are mysteriously killed, Smith continues the operation, keeping Schaffer as a close ally and secretly updating Rolland and Turner by radio. The Germans eventually surround the commandos in a tavern, and they are forced to surrender; Smith and Schaffer (being officers) are separated from the other three operatives, Thomas (William Squire), Berkeley (Peter Barkworth), and Christiansen (Donald Houston). Smith and Schaffer kill their captors, blow up a supply depot, and prepare an escape route for later use. They reach the castle by riding on the roof of a cable car, and climb inside when Mary lowers a rope. German General Rosemeyer (Ferdy Mayne) and Standartenführer Kramer (Anton Diffring) are interrogating Carnaby when the three operative/prisoners arrive. They are revealed to be agents working for the Germans. Shortly thereafter, Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn, but Smith then forces Schaffer to disarm. He identifies himself as Sturmbannführer Johann Schmidt of the SD of the SS intelligence branch, and a spy too. As proof, he discreetly shows the name of Germany's top agent in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it. To test them, Schmidt proposes that they write down the names of their fellow agents in Britain, to be compared to his own list in his pocket. After the three finish their lists, Smith reveals that he was bluffing and that the lists were the mission's true objective. Meanwhile, Mary is visited by Sturmbannführer (Major) von Hapen (Derren Nesbitt), a Gestapo officer who is attracted to her, but he becomes suspicious of flaws in her cover story. Leaving her, he happens upon the scene of Carnaby's interrogation just as Smith finishes his explanation. Hapen puts everyone under arrest but is distracted when Mary arrives. Schaffer seizes the opportunity to kill Hapen and the other German officers with his silenced pistol. The group then makes its escape, taking the American General (who is actually a corporal named Jones, an actor trained to impersonate Carnaby) and three British Captains to the escape route. Schaffer sets explosives to create diversions around the castle, while Smith leads the group to the radio room, where he informs Rolland of their success. The group reunites with Heidi on the ground, boarding a bus they had obtained earlier as an escape vehicle. They battle their way on to an airfield and escape in their Ju 52 transport, where Turner has been waiting. As Turner debriefs Smith about the mission, Smith reveals that the name Kramer confirmed as Germany's top agent in Britain was Turner's. Rolland had lured Turner and the others into participating, so that MI6 could expose them; Smith's trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer (who had no connection to MI6) had been assigned to the mission to ensure its success. Turner aims a gun at Smith, who reveals that Rolland has had the gun's firing pin removed. Smith permits Turner to jump out of the aeroplane to his death, rather than be tried for treason and hanged.

They wanted me to kill a few people instead.\\" Burton approached producer Elliott Kastner \\"and asked him if he had some super-hero stuff for me where I don't get killed in the end.\\" The producer consulted MacLean and requested an adventure film filled with mystery, suspense, and action. Most of MacLean's novels had been made into films or were being filmed. Kastner persuaded MacLean to write a new story; six weeks later, he delivered the script, at that time entitled Castle of Eagles. Kastner hated the title, and chose Where Eagles Dare instead. The title is from Act I, Scene III in William Shakespeare's Richard III: \\"The world is grown so bad, that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch\\". Like virtually all of MacLean's works, Where Eagles Dare features his trademark \\"secret traitor\\", who must be unmasked by the end. Kastner and co-producer Jerry Gershwin announced in July 1966 that they had purchased five MacLean scripts, starting with Where Eagles Dare and When Eight Bells Toll. Brian Hutton had just made Sol Madrid for the producers and was signed to direct. =Filming= Eastwood and Burton reportedly dubbed the film 'Where Doubles Dare' due to the amount of screen time in which stand-ins doubled for the cast during action sequences. Filming began on 2 January 1968 in Austria and concluded in July 1968.Hughes, pp.191–192 Eastwood received a salary of $800,000 while Burton received $1,200,000.Munn, p. 79 This is one of the first films to have used front projection effect. This technology enabled filming of the scenes where the actors are on top of the cable car. Eastwood initially thought the script written by MacLean was \\"terrible\\" and was \\"all exposition and complications.\\" According to Derren Nesbitt, Eastwood requested that he be given less dialogue.

Director Hutton played to his actors' strengths, allowing for Burton's theatrical background to help the character of Smith and Eastwood's quiet demeanour to establish Schaffer. Eastwood took the part on the advice of his agent, who felt it would be interesting to see his client appear with someone with seniority. Eastwood and Burton got along well on set.http://theclinteastwoodarchive.blogspot.com/2009/12/eastwood- interviewed-03-eastwood-on.html?m=1 Derren Nesbitt was keen to be as authentic as possible with his character Von Happen. Whilst on location, he requested to meet a former member of the Gestapo to better understand how to play the character and to get the military regalia correct. He was injured on set whilst filming the scene in which Schaffer kills Von Happen. The blood squib attached to Nesbitt exploded with such force that he was temporarily blinded, though he made a quick recovery. The filming was delayed due to the adverse weather in Austria. Shooting took place in winter and early spring of 1968, and the crew had to contend with blizzards, sub-zero temperatures and potential avalanches.

It was a two-disc release, the first CD being the film music, the second the film music for Operation Crossbow and source music for Where Eagles Dare. The release has been limited to 3,000 pressings. Novel The principal difference is that the novel by Alistair MacLean is less violent. One scene during the escape from the castle where Smith saves a German guard from burning to death presaged the non-lethal thriller vein that MacLean would explore in his later career. In the novel the characters are more clearly defined and slightly more humorous than their depictions in the film, which is fast-paced and has sombre performances from Burton and Eastwood at its centre. Three characters are differently named in the novel: Ted Berkeley is called Edward Carraciola, Jock MacPherson is called Torrance-Smythe, and Major von Happen is instead Captain von Brauchitsch. A budding love story between Schaffer and Heidi was also cut. Indeed, in the novel Schaffer asks the pilot to arrange for a priest to meet them at the airport. In the book the group are flown into Germany on board an RAF Avro Lancaster, whereas in the film they are transported in a Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 52. While in the film Kramer, Rosemeyer, and Von Happen are shot dead by Schaffer and Smith, in the novel they are just given high doses of nembutal. In the book Thomas, Carraciola, and Christiansen attempt to escape in the cable car with Smith on the roof. Carraciola is crushed by the steel suspension arm of the cable car while struggling with Smith on the roof; Thomas and Christiansen fall to their deaths after Smith blows the cable car up with plastic explosive. In the film Christiansen is killed and Berkeley (Carraciola in the novel) incapacitated by Smith on the cable car (he dies apparently when the cable car explodes), and Thomas is shot and killed by a German soldier while climbing down a rope.https://warmoviebuff.blogspot.com/2015/07/bookmovie-where-eagles- dare-19671968.html?m=1 In popular culture The British heavy metal band Iron Maiden recorded a song called \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" on their 1983 album Piece of Mind.

As of the end of 2019, the bank had HKD3,026 billion in assets and operating profit of HKD39.8 billion. Its head office is in the Bank of China Tower in Central, Hong Kong.\\"Contact Us .\\" Bank of China (Hong Kong). Retrieved on 11 September 2011. \\"Registered Office BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Limited 52/F Bank of China Tower 1 Garden Road Hong Kong\\" The head office is shared with the Hong Kong units of its parent company; completed in 1988, and was the first building outside of North America to exceed 1,000 feet (300 m). History The Bank of China Building under construction in 1988 =Bank of China Group= The opening of a branch of the Bank of China in Hong Kong in 1917 marked the entry of state-owned Chinese banks into the then- colony's banking sector. Other banks soon followed suit, starting with Yien Yieh Commercial Bank in 1918. By the time the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, there were 15 branches of state owned Chinese banks in Hong Kong, plus branches of nine Mainland-incorporated banks that were public- private joint ventures. In addition, the Chinese government established Po Sang Bank in 1949 and Nanyang Commercial Bank in 1950. Both of these were incorporated in Hong Kong. In 1952, the nine public-private banks (namely, Sin Hua Bank Limited, China & South Sea Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, China State Bank Limited, The National Commercial Bank Limited, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Young Brothers Banking Corporation, Wo Sang Bank and National Industrial Bank of China) were grouped into the Joint Office of Joint Public-Private Banks. The Hong Kong branches of the last three of these nine were closed in 1954 when their parents were shut down by the central government, and management of the remaining six public-private banks were transferred to the Hong Kong and Macau Regional Office of the Bank of China in 1958. The Bank of China later took over management of the Hong Kong branches of Kwangtung Provincial Bank, Hua Chiao Commercial Bank and the Bank of Communications (HKSE: 3328). In June 1975, the Bank of China moved to increase the capital of the public-private banks. As all of the new capital was from the Chinese government, private ownership in the public-private banks was substantially reduced, in some cases to less than 1%. The 14 banks were rebranded as part of the Bank of China Group in the 1980s, after a common IT platform was established. Treasury and foreign currency exchange operations were also centralised. However, the individual banks retained their own management. They are now the second largest banking group in Hong Kong. =Restructuring and listing= The Hong Kong branch of the Bank of Communications broke off from the Bank of China Group in 1998. The Bank of China Group started to restructure its operations in 1999 in preparation for an initial public offering. All minority shareholders (except for those of Chiyu) were bought out by the Bank of China. Formal plans for a restructuring received the approval of the People's Bank of China and were launched in January 2001. The restructuring saw all operations of the Mainland-incorporated group members merged into Po Sang Bank, which was then immediately renamed Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited. Hong Kong incorporated Nanyang Commercial Bank and Chiyu Banking Corporation became subsidiaries of Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited. Legislation was required for the merger, as Hong Kong does not allow mergers via the pooling of interests, a common procedure in the United States. The Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (Merger) Ordinance was approved by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong on 12 July 2001, and the merger was completed on 1 October 2001. Corporate structure and BOC Hong Kong Holdings Bank of China (Hong Kong) is a listed company of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, via its parent company BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Limited (BOCHK Holdings). The holding owned 100% shares of the bank. Moreover, American depositary receipt of the shares of the holdings, were traded on OTC Market. BOCHK Holdings is a constituent of the Hang Seng Index. The listing of BOCHK Holdings in July 2002 listing was the first international stock listing by a Mainland China bank; until that time, other Mainland Chinese bank listings were done in the domestic \\"A-share\\" market. For the 12 months ended 31 December 2019, BOCHK Holdings earned HKD58.4 billion in operating income and HKD34.1 billion in net profit. As of the end of 2019, 65.65% of BOCHK Holdings is held by Bank of China Group, in turn 69.265% owned by Central Huijin Investment, an investment holding company 100% owned by the Government of the People's Republic of China. Operations BOCHK offers a comprehensive range of financial products and services to retail and corporate customers, similar to those offered by most commercial banks. It is primarily known for its interest-income business (taking deposits from retail customers for loans to corporates) although it has been moving into other non-interest-income areas such as personal loans, wealth management and other financial services in recent years. It has Hong Kong's biggest branch network including approximately 190 branches, 280 automated banking centres, over 1,000 automatic teller machines as of end 2019. BOCHK is one of the key mortgage lenders in Hong Kong. The other key lenders include HSBC and Hang Seng Bank.Centaline - Statistical Analysis on the Mortgage Registration (Jan 2018) Within Mainland China, BOCHK operates 14 branches () separately from its parent. BOCHK is treated as a foreign bank, more properly, 境外銀行 (banks outside of the territory), for regulatory purposes as it is incorporated in Hong Kong. However, partly to clear up confusion between it and its parent in the mainland, it shifted all of its mainland- based business to Nanyang Commercial Bank in 2007. =Renminbi clearing bank= BOCHK has been the designated clearing bank for personal transactions involving the Renminbi (CNY, the currency of Mainland China) in Hong Kong since February 2004. This means that BOCHK acts as a settlement agent for RMB banknotes and funds in Hong Kong and an intermediary between banks in Hong Kong and the People's Bank of China, the central bank of the People's Republic of China. In return, BOCHK takes a 0.125% cut of all RMB deposits in Hong Kong that are repatriated back to Mainland China. The chief executive of Hong Kong announced on 18 November 2003 that the People's Bank of China had agreed to provide clearing arrangements, marking for the first time that the Renminbi, which is fully on the current account but not on the capital account, has been allowed to clear outside of Mainland China. The scope of such RMB business includes deposit-taking, exchange, remittances and RMB cards. Hong Kong banks were invited to apply to become the designated clearing bank for RMB business; the People's Bank of China subsequently chose BOCHK as the clearing bank, for a term of three years. According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the major responsibilities of the clearing bank are to: * open RMB settlement accounts for participating banks for the acceptance and withdrawal of RMB funds * open a settlement account with the PBOC's Shenzhen sub-branch to centralise the acceptance and withdrawal of RMB funds of the Clearing Bank and the participating banks * collect and distribute RMB banknotes * provide clearing services for RMB remittances and RMB cards issued by Hong Kong banks * provide services for the participating banks to square their RMB open positions that result from the exchange of RMB into Hong Kong dollars and vice versa. =Nanyang Commercial Bank= Nanyang Commercial Bank branch in Kennedy Town, Hong Kong Founded in 1950 in Hong Kong, Nanyang Commercial Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of BOCHK, with 42 branches. Nanyang primarily focuses on corporate customers, in particular small and medium-sized trading and manufacturing companies. It also has a loyal following amongst the overseas Chinese community, especially in South East Asia. It relies on BOCHK for back- end office and IT support. In 2007, it took over all of BOCHK's mainland operations, corporate and individual. =Chiyu Banking Corporation= Founded by Tan Kah Kee, an overseas Chinese in 1947, Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited has 23 branches in Hong Kong and focuses on serving the community of residents of Fujian descent in Hong Kong. Chiyu was explicitly created by Chen to create a sustainable business with profits to be devoted to education in Xiamen and the rest of Fujian province in China. Since its founding, it has spent more than HK$1 billion in education in the province, primarily through funding Jimei University and its related schools. In 2017 BOC (HK) sold Chiyu Bank. =JETCO= JETCO () (Joint Electronic Teller Services Limited) is the biggest network of automatic teller machines in Hong Kong and Macau, with nearly 3,000 cash machines.JETCO Official Website Feb 12, 2018 JETCO was founded by BOCHK in 1982 along with the Bank of East Asia, Chekiang First Bank, Shanghai Commercial Bank and Wing Lung Bank, and at present covers all licensed commercial banks in Hong Kong and Macau, except for HSBC and Hang Seng Bank, which has their own system. JETCO's agreement with UnionPay has been terminated due to disagreements, leaving two choices for Hong Kong-based customers: get a UnionPay card, usable like any other on the mainland, or look for a Bank of East Asia ATM (Bank of East Asia has linked all of its mainland- based ATMs into the JETCO network) that can be used like any other JETCO ATM. =Other operations= BOCHK also owns a travel agency known as BOC Travel Services. This is a legacy from its acquisition of Nanyang Commercial Bank, which ran a travel agency for the convenience of its Southeast Asian customers. Banknotes A Bank of China HK$20 note of the 2003 series. Although not a central bank, BOCHK issues banknotes in Hong Kong. Under present arrangements, most Hong Kong dollar notes are not issued by a central bank or monetary authority, but by three specially licensed commercial banks, these being the Bank of China, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank. Bank of China started to issue Hong Kong dollar notes on 1 May 1994, under the name of \\"Bank of China Hong Kong Branch\\". Following the Bank's 2001 merger and restructuring, a new set of notes bearing the name \\"Bank of China (Hong Kong)\\" went into circulation in 2004. Under the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (Merger) Ordinance, banknotes issued by the Bank of China prior to its merger remained legal tender and became the obligations of Bank of China (Hong Kong). As one of the three note-issuing banks, BOCHK is also a rotating chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, the main industry body of commercial banks in Hong Kong. Bank of China Tower Bank of China Tower at night The Bank of China Tower in Central houses the headquarters of Bank of China Hong Kong. Designed by Ieoh Ming Pei, the 70-storey building's height is 315 metres with two masts reaching 369 metres. Construction began in 1985 and the building was completed in 1989, with its official opening on 17 May 1990. Bank of China Tower was the first building outside North America to break the mark, the first composite space frame high-rise building and was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1989 to 1992. A small observation deck on the 43rd floor of the building is open to the public; visits to the main observation deck on the 70th floor is by appointment only. The structural expressionism adopted in the design of this building resembles growing bamboo shoots, symbolising livelihood and prosperity. While its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong's most identifiable landmarks today, it was the source of some controversy at one time, as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the convention of consulting with feng shui masters on matters of design prior to construction. Corporate governance One of the stated goals of the restructuring of BOCHK was to aggressively improve corporate governance and risk management. Issues regarding BOCHK's corporate governance were widely reported in 2003 and 2004 following allegations of misconduct. Investigations are continuing . BOCHK subsequently reorganised and tightened internal controls, and made several executive appointments via a global replacement effort. =Liu Jinbao= A former CEO of BOCHK, Liu Jinbao, was abruptly transferred back to Beijing to become vice-chairman of Bank of China in May 2003. Investigations subsequently found Liu to have \\"committed economic crimes\\" in connection with his previous appointment as the head of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China. Liu was subsequently dismissed from his post. Liu, along with three other senior managers, were also alleged to have made \\"unauthorised distribution for personal purposes\\" of funds belonging to the Bank of China before BOCHK was established. The Standard speculated that the amount involved was HK$30 million. =New Nongkai loan= A special committee appointed by BOC (Hong Kong) Holdings in consultation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority found that the granting of a HK$1.77 billion bridge loan to Chau Ching-ngai (sometimes referred to as Zhou Zhengyi depending on transliteration), involved risks identified at the start (that) were not addressed adequately and was granted despite serious reservations expressed by the Risk Management Department (BOCHK). Liu Jinbao was criticised by the committee and a deputy CEO, Or Man-ah, took early retirement as a result.

Biography Born Bertha Matilde Honoré in Louisville, Kentucky, her father was businessman Henry Hamilton Honoré. Bertha, known within the family as \\"Cissie\\", studied in her home town and achieved a reputation as a skilled musician, proficient linguist, brilliant writer, able politician, and fine administrator. Marriage Portrait titled \\"Mrs. Potter Palmer\\" by Anders Zorn, 1893 Bertha Honoré married the Chicago millionaire Potter Palmer in 1870. She was twenty-one and he was forty-four. Palmer was a Quaker merchant who had come to Chicago after failing twice in business. In Chicago he learned to please his customers, many of whom were women. He made customer service a priority and carried everything from dry goods to the latest French fashions for ladies. Palmer sold his vast store to a consortium and it would eventually become Marshall Field's. Palmer then opened a luxury hotel, Palmer HouseNow the Palmer Hilton. and invested in real estate, eventually owning a vast portfolio of properties. Soon after their marriage, the Chicago Fire wiped out the Palmer House and most of their holdings, and Bertha Palmer had to rush off to wire the east so that Palmer could re-establish credit, borrow money and rebuild his holdings. Bertha Palmer was unusually poised for one so young, and together the Palmers re- established their fortune, and despite her age she quickly rose to the top of Chicago society. \\"She was beautiful, dashing, quick, and smart; and more than that, she was sure of herself,\\" wrote historian Ernest Poole.For background biography, see Mounted on a Pedestal: Bertha Honoré Palmer by Hope L. Black or Silhouette in Diamonds: The Life of Mrs. Potter Palmer by Ishbel Ross. In 1874, she gave birth to son Honoré, and in 1875, she gave birth to son Potter Palmer II. Both sons went on to have sons named Potter Palmer III, as well as other children. See Who's Who in Chicago (1931). She was an early member of the Chicago Woman's Club, part of the General Federation of Women's Clubs; this group of working women met to discuss social problems and develop solutions. They supported kindergartens until the city made them part of the school system, and campaigned for inexpensive milk for impoverished children and better care for children of imprisoned mothers. Chicago World's Fair and The Women's Building Chicago was site of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, a celebration of the discovery of the New World by Columbus.Yes, we know that others were there first, but they were celebrating Columbus. It also marked the city's recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Women had a large presence in the fair and the plum position was the President of the Board of Lady Managers, which Bertha Palmer was selected to lead in 1891.See World's Columbian Exposition, Board of Lady Managers, Addresses and Reports, Chicago, 1893 While the positions were honorary, the women had a great deal of work to do. The board chose Sophia Hayden as architect for The Woman's Building and designer to supervise the interior decoration. However, when Hayden wouldn't take Palmer's advice to accept rich women's donations of architectural odds and ends to decorate the exterior, fearing a horrible visual impact as a result, Palmer fired Hayden and hired the much more malleable Candace Wheeler to supervise the interior decoration. The Chicago art curator Sarah Tyson Hallowell (1846–1924)See Jeffrey Morseburg's The Indefatigable Sarah Hallowell essay for general background and influence. She introduced French Impressionism to Chicago in 1890. worked closely with Palmer on the art exhibits and the murals. Apparently, it was Palmer who chose the theme of \\"Primitive Woman\\" and \\"Modern Woman\\" for the two murals and Hallowell and Palmer's first choice for both murals was Elizabeth Jane Gardner (1837–1922), an experienced academic painter and the paramour of William- Adolphe Bouguereau (1825–1905). However, the time to paint the two huge murals (12' x 54') was short and the artist did not feel that she had the energy to complete the project. Hallowell then recommended the young academic painter Mary Fairchild MacMonnies and the Impressionist painter Mary Cassatt to do the two murals and after their initial rejection of the contracts, the women only had a number of months to complete the murals and have them shipped to Chicago.Eve's Daughter, Modern Woman: A Mural by Mary Cassatt has an extensive play by play in the chapter World's Columbian Exposition. Led by Palmer, who approached Congress on the matter, the board also requested that the mint produce a new commemorative coin for the Exposition, and their efforts resulted in the Isabella quarter. Following the opening of the Exposition, Palmer sat for the fashionable Swedish painter Anders Zorn (1860–1920), who was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers from the fair. Art collecting At the time of the fair, the Palmers had been enthusiastic art collectors for a number of years. They depended on the curator Sarah Hallowell, a Philadelphia Quaker who they had met in 1873, for advice and she introduced the Palmers to the painters in Paris and to the latest artistic trends in the French capital.For an extensive account of Hallowell's relationship with the Palmers, see Kirsten M. Jensen, Her Sex Was an Insuperable Objection: Sara Tyson Hallowell and the Art Institute of Chicago, MA Thesis, Southern Connecticut State University, 2000 Most Midwestern collectors were still collecting works by the Barbizon School in the 1870s and 1880s, but thanks to the Palmers, this would soon change. In the years leading up to the Columbian Exposition, they became clients of the Parisian dealer Paul Durand-Ruel and began to collect French Impressionist works. Because Hallowell was curating a loan exhibition of the latest French art for the exposition, the Palmers accelerated their collecting because the curator wanted the latest and greatest in French art for the fair. The Palmer's collection of Impressionist paintings was soon unrivaled, soon they had twenty-nine Monets and eleven Renoirs. These works now form the core of the Art Institute of Chicago's Impressionist collection. Hallowell also tried to get the Palmers interested in Auguste Rodin's work, which he had loaned her for the fair. The frankness of his nudes had caused a stir at the fair and after resisting for a number of months, works by Rodin entered the collection as well and these were among the first acquired by American collectors. Bertha Palmer enjoyed her role as a cultural leader and tastemaker.For this section, also see Hobbs, Bertha Honore Palmer's Philanthropy in the Arts, M.A. Thesis In 1905, Hallowell finally convinced Mrs. Palmer to sit for Rodin. Palmer spent vast sums on the Palmer Mansion Luxurious mansions and lavish spending Bertha Palmer was famous for her free spending ways. Her husband indulged her and did not mind that she was in the limelight. Her jewelry was legendary. According to the author Aline B. Saarinen, > so fabulous were her jewels that a newspaper declared that when she appeared > on the S.S. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse with a tiara of diamonds as large as > lima beans, a corsage panned with diamonds, a sunburst as big as a baseball, > a stomacher of diamonds and all the pearls around her neck, Alois > Burgskeller of the Metropolitan Opera, who was singing at the ship's > concert, was stopped right in the middle of a high note. She traveled throughout Europe, dining with kings and queens and mixing with industrialists and statesmen.Aline Saarinen, Proud Possessors, Conde Nast, 1958 Vast sums were spent on the Palmer Mansion in Chicago, starting with $100,000 and rising over $1 million. Potter Palmer dictated in his will that a sum of money should go to whoever next married Bertha. When asked why he would be so generous to his own replacement, he replied, \\"Because he'll need it.\\" She also maintained homes in London and Paris and, following her husband's death in 1902, rumors abounded that she would marry a titled man. Among the suspected suitors were the earl of Munster, the duke of Atholl, the prince of Monaco, and the king of Serbia. However, these rumors all proved to be unfounded when she remained unmarried. In September 1907, Bertha Palmer and her son Potter II took part in the maiden voyage of the new Cunard liner RMS Lusitania from Liverpool to New York. Florida real estate pioneer Bertha Palmer became interested in the winter climate of Florida and in 1910 bought over 80,000 acres of land in and around Sarasota, Florida—about one-third of the land in what was then the massive county named Manatee. In 1914, she bought of land as an exclusive hunting preserve called \\"River Hills\\" in Temple Terrace, Florida. After her death, her sons inherited the land and eventually sold it to developers who created the Mediterranean Revival golf course community of Temple Terrace, Florida. She became a progressive rancher, land developer, and farm developer who introduced many innovations to encourage the Florida ranching, citrus, dairy, and farming industries. Palmer was one of the first famous people to winter in Florida, beginning a now-common practice. She encouraged wealthy friends and associates in her international social circles to spend winters along Sarasota Bay and her other Florida land interests and promoted the development of many land parcels; today much of that land is still known as Palmer Ranch. The major roads through her property, as well as some connecting to the existing communities, were named by her. Those names remain unchanged as Honoré, Lockwood Ridge, Tuttle, Webber, and Macintosh. She proved herself to be an astute businesswoman: within sixteen years after her husband's death, she managed to double the value of the estate he had left her. After her death, a large parcel of her land was donated (donated according to Sarasota County, sold according to the state) by her sons to become Myakka River State Park. Death Upon her death at her winter residence, The Oaks in Osprey, Florida, her body was returned to Chicago to lie in state at the Castle, the sumptuous mansion Potter Palmer had built on Chicago's Gold Coast. Bertha Palmer is buried alongside her husband in Graceland Cemetery. Documentary project On March 24, 2013, the half-hour documentary Love Under Fire: The Story of Bertha and Potter Palmerhttp://www.berthapalmer.com aired on PBS affiliate WTTW11 Chicago.

The region was later reorganized into the Armeniac Theme under the Byzantine Empire. Geography Lesser Armenia (or Armenia Minor) was the portion of historic Armenia and the Armenian Highlands lying west and northwest of the river Euphrates. It received its name to distinguish it from the much larger eastern portion of historic Armenia—Greater Armenia (or Armenia Major). Initial history Anatolia in the early 1st century AD with Armenia Minor as a Roman client state Lesser Armenia (in greenish yellow, near the Black Sea) at the end of the 2nd century BC, just before the Roman conquest =Early history= From the 6th century BC, the territory of Lesser Armenia was ruled by the Orontid Dynasty (Yervanduni, ), who were subjects of the Achaemenid Empire. The early Armenian kingdom was named the Satrapy of Armenia. Some time after the death of Alexander the Great, Mithridates, a Persian nobleman from Asia Minor, declared himself king of the region that later became known as the Kingdom of Pontus. As the kingdom grew in strength, it included Lesser Armenia well. =Roman–Persian wars= The Roman–Persian frontier and the Armenian provinces in the 5th century Armenia was a disputed kingdom between Rome and Parthia during the Roman–Persian Wars from 66 BC to the 2nd century AD. Roman influence was first established with Pompey's campaign of 66/65 BC, and again in 59 AD in the Roman–Parthian War campaign of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo; which resulted in the deposition of Tiridates I. Roman and Byzantine Lesser Armenia All of Armenia became a Roman province in AD 114 under Roman emperor Trajan, but Roman Armenia was soon after abandoned by the legions in 118 AD and became a vassal kingdom. Lesser Armenia, however, was generally incorporated by Trajan, together with Miletene and Cataonia into the province of Cappadocia. Lesser Armenia consisted of five districts: Orbalisene in the North; below that Aetulane (also, Ætulane); Aeretice (also Æretice); then Orsene; and finally Orbesine, the most southern. The more southern districts appended to Lesser Armenia were Miletene, so called from its capital (the modern Malatya) and the following four small districts of ancient Cataonia, namely, Aravene; Lavinianesine or Lavianesine; Cataonia, in the more restricted sense, or the country close upon Cilicia surrounded by mountains; finally, Muriane or Murianune, between Cataonia and Melitene, called likewise Bagadoania. Romans lost Armenia again to Vologases IV of Parthia in AD 161. In 163, a Roman counter-attack under Statius Priscus once again installed a favoured candidate on the throne of Armenia, and Roman influence in Armenia remained until the Roman temporary defeat at the Battle of Barbalissos in 253. But a few years later, at the end of the 3rd century, Rome was again in control of Armenia and successively promoted the Christianization of all Armenia. Lesser Armenia was reunited with the kingdom of Greater Armenia under the Arshakuni king Tiridates III in AD 287 until the temporary conquest of Shapur II in 337. Then it was formed into a regular province under Diocletian, and in the 4th century, was divided in two provinces: First Armenia (Armenia Prima), which contained most of Lesser Armenia, and Second Armenia (Armenia Secunda) that comprised all the southern tracts which had been added to Lesser Armenia, with the exception of Cataonia, which was incorporated with Cappadocia Secunda. Its population remained Armenian but was being gradually Romanized. Since the 3rd century many Armenian soldiers were in the Roman army: later–in the 4th century–they made up two Roman legions, the Legio I Armeniaca and the Legio II Armeniaca. In 536, the emperor Justinian I reorganized the provincial administration, and First and Second Armenia were renamed Second and Third respectively, while some of their territory was split off to the other Armenian provinces. The borders of the Byzantine part of Armenia were expanded in 591 into Persarmenia, but the region was the focus of decades of warfare between the Byzantines and the Persians (the Byzantine- Sassanid Wars) until the Arab conquest of Armenia in 639. After this, the part of Lesser Armenia remaining under Byzantine control (in a lesser extent) became part of the theme of Armeniakon. Mongol and Ottoman influence After the downfall of Bagratid Armenia in 1045 and resulting subsequent losses of Byzantine Empire in the East in 1071 (after the Battle of Manzikert), Lesser Armenia fell to the Seljuks and then was part of the Mongol Empire for 92 years and of the Ottoman Empire from the late 15th century. Between the 11th and 14th centuries the term Lesser Armenia (sometimes called \\"Little Armenia\\") was applied to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, until the formation of Turkey in 1923.

Liberalism was introduced in the Ottoman Empire during the Tanzimat period of reformation. History Murad V, 33rd Ottoman Sultan (Emperor) On 30 May 1876, Murad V became the Sultan when his uncle Abdülaziz was deposed. He was highly influenced by French culture and was a liberal. He reigned for 93 days before being deposed on the grounds that he was supposedly mentally ill in 31 August 1876; however his opponents may simply have used those grounds to stop his implementation of democratic reforms. As a result, he was unable to deliver the Constitution that his supporters had sought.Palmer, Alan. The Decline and Fall of the Ottoman Empire, 1992. Page 141–143. = Constitutional era = Constitutionalism was introduced in the Ottoman Empire by liberal intellectuals who tried to modernize their society by promoting development, progress, and liberal values. Düzoğlu Mihran Bey, liberal politician. Midhat Pasha.  Tanzimât  The Tanzimât, literally meaning reorganization of the Ottoman Empire (see Nizam), was a period of reformation that began in 1839 and ended with the First Constitutional Era in 1876.Cleveland, William L & Martin Bunton, A History of the Modern Middle East: 4th Edition, Westview Press: 2009, p. 82. Although the motives for the implementation of Tanzimât were burocratic, it was impulsed by liberal ministers and intellectuals like Dimitrios Zambakos Pasha, Kabuli Mehmed Pasha, the secret society Young Ottomans, and Midhat Pasha, who is also often considered as one of the founders of the Ottoman Parliament. Many changes were made to improve civil liberties, but many Muslims saw them as foreign influence on the world of Islam. That perception complicated reformist efforts made by the state.Roderic. H. Davison, Essays in Ottoman and Turkish History, 1774-1923 – The Impact of West, Texas 1990, pp. 115-116. A policy called Ottomanism was meant to unite all the different peoples living in Ottoman territories, \\"Muslim and non-Muslim, Turkish and Greek, Armenian and Jewish, Kurd and Arab\\". The policy officially began with the Edict of Gülhane of 1839, declaring equality before the law for both Muslim and non-Muslim Ottomans.The Invention of Tradition as Public Image in the Late Ottoman Empire, 1808 to 1908, Selim Deringil, Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan. 1993), pp. 3-29 The Tanzimât reforms began under Sultan Mahmud II. On November 3, 1839, Sultan Abdulmejid I issued a hatt-i sharif or imperial edict called the Edict of Gülhane or Tanzimât Fermânı. This was followed by several statutes enacting its policies. In the edict the Sultan stated that he wished \\"to bring the benefits of a good administration to the provinces of the Ottoman Empire through new institutions.\\" Among the reforms were the abolition of slavery and slave trade;NTV Tarih history magazine, issue of July 2011. \\"Sultan Abdülmecid: İlklerin Padişahı\\", pages 46-50. (Turkish) the decriminalization of homosexuality; the establishment of the Civil Service School, an institution of higher learning for civiliansCleveland & Bunton, A History of the Modern Middle East, Chapter 5 pg.84 of 4th edition the Press and Journalism Regulation Code; and the Nationality Law of 1869 creating a common Ottoman citizenship irrespective of religious or ethnic divisions; among others. Western educated economists like Ahmet Reşat Pasha advocated for economic liberalism.https://www.biyografya.com/biyografi/14145  Young Ottomans  The Young Ottomans were a secret society established in 1865 by a group of Ottoman Turkish intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the Tanzimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire, which they believed did not go far enough, and wanted to end the autocracy in the empire. Young Ottomans sought to transform Ottoman society by preserving the empire and modernizing along the European tradition of adopting a constitutional government. Though the Young Ottomans were frequently in disagreement ideologically, they all agreed that the new constitutional government should continue to be somewhat rooted in Islam to emphasize \\"the continuing and essential validity of Islam as the basis of Ottoman political culture.\\"Finkel 2006, p. 475. However, they sincreticize Islamic idealism with modern liberalism and parliamentary democracy, to them the European parliamentary liberalism was a model to follow, in accordance with the tenets of Islam and \\"attempted to reconcile Islamic concepts of government with the ideas of Montesquieu, Danton, Rousseau, and contemporary European Scholars and statesmen.\\" Namık Kemal, who was influential in the formation of the society, admired the constitution of the French Third Republic, he summed up the Young Ottomans' political ideals as \\"the sovereignty of the nation, the separation of powers, the responsibility of officials, personal freedom, equality, freedom of thought, freedom of press, freedom of association, enjoyment of property, sanctity of the home\\".Hanioğlu, M. Şükrü (2008). A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, Princeton University Press. . p. 104. The Young Ottomans believed that one of the principal reasons for the decline of the empire was abandoning Islamic principles in favor of imitating European modernity with unadvised compromises to both and they sought to unite the two in a way that they believed would best serve the interests of the state and its people.Zürcher 2004, p. 78. They sought to revitalize the empire by incorporating certain Europeans models of government, while still retaining the Islamic foundations the empire was founded on.A History of the Modern Middle East. Cleveland and Buntin p.78 Among the prominent members of this society were writers and publicists such as İbrahim Şinasi, Namık Kemal, Ali Suavi, Ziya Pasha, and Agah Efendi. In 1876, the Young Ottomans had their defining moment when Sultan Abdülhamid II reluctantly promulgated the Ottoman constitution of 1876 (), the first attempt at a constitution in the Ottoman Empire, ushering in the First Constitutional Era. Although this period was short lived, with Abdülhamid ultimately suspending the constitution and parliament in 1878 in favor of a return to absolute monarchy with himself in power,Finkel 2006, p. 489-490. the legacy and influence of the Young Ottomans continued to endure until the collapse of the empire. Several decades later, another group of reform-minded Ottomans, namely the Young Turks, repeated the Young Ottomans' efforts, leading to the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 and the beginning of the Second Constitutional Era. =Freedom and Accord Party= Nafi Pasha, member of the liberal Freedom and Accord Party openly discussed about voting rights for women during the Second Constitutional Era. *1911: As a reaction to dictatorial tendencies, the liberal Freedom and Accord Party (Hürriyet ve İtilaf Fırkası) is founded. *1913: The party is banned. = Ottoman Liberal People's Party / Freedom Party = *1918: Fethi Okyar founded in 1918 the Ottoman Liberal People's Party (Osmanlı Hürriyetperver Avam Fırkası). *1920: The party disappeared. *1930: In an attempt to allow a legal opposition party, Atatürk encouraged Okyar to found the Freedom Party (Hürriyet Fırkası), also rendered as Liberal Republican Party (Serbest Cumhuriyet Fırkası). *1930: The party attracted huge number of dissident people of the Kemalist bureaucracy's harsh policies.

Generally left-wing, the party places a strong emphasis on democracy, feminism, minority rights. It is an associate member of the Party of European Socialists (PES), consultative member of the Socialist International and member of Progressive Alliance.http://progressive-alliance.info/network/parties-and-organisations/ For the June 2015 general election, the HDP took the decision to field candidates as a party despite the danger of potentially falling below the 10% threshold. Even though most of the politicians from HDP are secular left-wing Kurds, the candidate list included devout Muslims, socialists, Alevis, Armenians, Syriac Christians, Azerbaijanis, Circassians, Lazi, Romanis and LGBT activists. Of the 550 candidates, 268 were women. In 2015, Barış Sulu was the first openly gay parliamentary candidate in Turkey as a candidate of the HDP.First-ever openly gay parliamentary candidate stands for election in Turkey The Independent, 25 May 2015.

Michener published in 1965. It is a survey of the history of the Jewish people and the land of Israel from pre- monotheistic days to the birth of the modern State of Israel. The Source uses, for its central device, a fictional tell in northern Israel called \\"Makor\\" (). Prosaically, the name comes from a freshwater well just north of Makor, but symbolically it stands for much more, historically and spiritually. Unlike most Michener novels, this book is not in strict chronological order. A parallel frame story set in Israel in the 1960s supports the historical timeline. Archaeologists digging at the tell at Makor uncover artifacts from each layer, which then serve as the basis for a chapter exploring the lives of the people involved with that artifact. The book follows the story of the Family of Ur from a Stone Age family whose wife begins to believe that there is a supernatural force, which slowly leads us to the beginnings of monotheism. The descendants are not aware of the ancient antecedents revealed to the reader by the all-knowing writer as the story progresses through the Davidic kingdom, Hellenistic times, Roman times, etc. The site is continually inhabited until the end of the Crusades when it is destroyed by the victorious Mameluks (as happened to many actual cities after 1291) and is not rebuilt by the Ottomans. Chapter list #The Tell – 1963, three archeologists, a Jew, a Catholic, and a Muslim, are at a modern archeological dig. The story moves back and forth between the historical chapters and the modern dig at the tell at Makor. #The Bee-Eater (Level XV, 9831 BCE) – Introduction to the Ur family in Stone Age times and their first move into an agricultural society. #Of Death and Life (Level XIV, 2202 BCE) – Starting prior to 2000 BCE, the concept of an ultimate supreme being takes root with the introduction of the Cult of El, as are some barbaric and mystic practices, like child sacrifice and temple prostitution. #An Old Man and His God – Bronze Age, an early view of Hebrews as they moved from the desert life into Canaan and brought along the early teachings of El Shaddai. Makor is sacked by the Hebrews in 1491 BCE. #Psalm of the Hoopoe Bird – Takes place 1040–970 BCE, during the last years of King David. #The Voice of Gomer – Takes place 605 BCE – 562 BCE. Following the Egyptian defeat at the Battle of Carchemish, Nebuchadnezzar II marches into the Levant and deports the Jews to Babylon. #In the Gymnasium – 222–187 BCE, Jewish life under the Seleucid Empire. #King of the Jews – 74 BCE – 4 CE: this chapter is told in epistolary form and describes the rise of the ambitious Herod the Great and his eventual descent into madness. #Yigal and His Three Generals – 12-70 CE: this chapter begins with rule of the mad Caligula and his attempt to force idolatry on the Jews. After his death, he was replaced by the madder Nero, who ordered Vespasian to repress Josephus and the First Jewish–Roman War. #The Law – This chapter takes place after the Empress Helena's pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Christianity is being forced in Galilee as churches are mass-produced. This chapter is about two Jews who convert to Christianity due to the strictness of the Talmud (during this time the Gemara is being written), but are soon disenfranchised by the Christian Schism. This chapter is also the fictional origin of St. Mark. #A Day in the Life of a Desert Rider – This chapter begins with the introduction of Islam to the Holy Land by Muslim conquests. #Volkmar – This chapter opens with Peter the Hermit as he travels the European countryside in search of participants for the ill- fated People's Crusade. It concludes with the First Crusade and the Siege of Jerusalem. #The Fires of Ma Coeur – In 1291, the last crusader strongholds begin to fall to the Mamaluks. The final stronghold is Acre. #The Saintly Men of Safed – This chapter focuses on the three Rabbis who meet in Safed while escaping the Spanish Inquisition and European pogroms, and their culture clashes between Sephardim, Ashkenazim and Kabbalistic traditions. #Twilight of an Empire – In the 1880s the Ottoman Empire is falling apart and this chapter delves into the deep corruption in the public administration and Sultan Abdul Hamid II's backlash at reform. #Rebbe Itzik and the Sabra – 1948 – The new state of Israel starts to emerge. This chapter deals with the origins of two characters in the present day narrative – Ilan Eliav and Vered Bar El. #The Tell – culmination of the novel and rediscovery of the well built and described in the previous chapter Psalm of the Hoopoe Bird. Recurring symbols and themes =Fertility/The phallic= In the early civilizations, the concept of fertility sprouts from agriculture and the desire for a fruitful harvest. During the earliest layer of history, the giant stone idol named El is created to please the earth and bring good crops. As society moves away from a rural and agricultural existence, fertility is given less and less importance. The phallic is present from the Stone Age (\\"The Bee Eater\\"), until 606 BCE (\\"The Voice of Gomer\\"). =Prayer= Later, as modern Judaism begins to take form, the theme of dedication and tenacity is brought forward again and again. The final words of many of the book's characters are of prayer; they are defending their religion with their life. As anti-semitism becomes more prevalent, this theme grows stronger, as if to show the strength of the faith that the Jewish people hold.

Chris Cooper, Robert Forster, Richard Jenkins, Daniel Greene, Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon and Mongo Brownlee co-star. The film is about a Rhode Island state trooper named Charlie who, after years of continuously suppressing his rage and feelings, suffers a psychotic breakdown that results in a second personality, Hank. This was also Carrey's first role in a 20th Century Fox film. Also, this is the Farrelly brothers 2nd film with Carrey, the first time since Dumb and Dumber was released in 1994. Plot Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey) is a veteran Rhode Island state trooper who has been taken advantage of by those around him, including his wife Layla (Traylor Howard). Almost immediately after their wedding, Layla begins to cheat on Charlie with their wedding limo chauffeur, a dwarf black man named Shonté. Despite his friends warning him of Layla's infidelity, Charlie refuses to accept it, even after she gave birth to biracial triplets. A few years later, Layla leaves with Shonté, abandoning her children. Charlie raises the triplets: Jamal, Lee Harvey, and Shonté Jr. (Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon, Mongo Brownlee). While Charlie is loved and respected by the boys, he is continually abused by the rest of the town. As a result of years of such treatment, Charlie develops a split personality named Hank to deal with the confrontations Charlie avoids. Emerging whenever Charlie is under extreme stress, Hank is an over-the-top, rude, and violent persona reminiscent of characters played by Clint Eastwood. A psychiatrist prescribes medication to keep Hank at bay. Believing that Charlie needs a vacation, his commanding officer (Robert Forster) orders him to escort Irene Waters (Renée Zellweger) from Rhode Island to Massena, New York, because she reportedly committed a hit-and-run. Irene insists the accusation is a lie told by Dickie (Daniel Greene), her mob-connected ex-boyfriend, to keep her from revealing his illegal activities to the authorities. In Massena, Charlie turns over Irene to two EPA agents. A hitman with a contract on Irene's life kills one of the agents. Irene and Charlie flee, leaving his medication behind in their haste and allowing Hank to emerge frequently. Charlie is unjustly blamed for the murder. FBI agents begin pursuing him and Irene, as do two crooked police officers in Dickie's payroll, Boshane (Richard Jenkins) and Gerke (Chris Cooper). The chase becomes a media spectacle, alerting Charlie's sons to his predicament. Charlie and Irene return to Rhode Island, developing a bond along the way. Though Irene is taken by Charlie's personality, Hank worries her, as his aggressive personality and overestimation of his own toughness often gets them into trouble. Along the way they pick up \\"Whitey\\" (Michael Bowman), an albino waiter who claims to have killed his entire family. While stopping at a motel, Hank convinces Irene to have sex with him by impersonating Charlie. When Charlie realizes what happened the next morning, he is incensed and begins fighting with Hank. They are almost ambushed by Boshane and Gerke, but Charlie's sons, having found them, steal a police helicopter and call in a false report, stating Charlie and Irene have been spotted in the woods nearby. Charlie and Irene leave Whitey at the motel and board a train back to Rhode Island. Dickie boards the same train, having been ordered by his superiors to \\"get his hands dirty\\". He kidnaps Irene, and Charlie gives chase, working together with Hank to save her. Hank balks when Dickie heads onto a bridge, but Charlie finally stands up for himself against his fears, thus permanently nullifying Hank. As Charlie tries to disarm Dickie, Dickie shoots off his thumb. Dickie is then hit from behind by a lawn dart thrown by Whitey, killing him. Charlie and Irene fall from the bridge into a river below. Charlie's sons arrive to rescue them. Regrouping with Whitey, Charlie apologizes for making him kill again, but Whitey reveals he made up his backstory for fear of Hank. The police arrive, but quickly learn of Irene's plight. Gerke and Boshane are arrested, Charlie is congratulated for bringing them to justice, and Irene is cleared of the charges against her. Irene prepares to leave Rhode Island when she is pulled over by the police, but this proves only to be a diversion to allow Charlie to propose marriage to her, which she happily accepts. In a post-credits scene, everyone looks for Charlie's thumb in the river. Whitey finds it, but a fish eats it. Cast * Jim Carrey as Charlie Baileygates/Hank Evans * Renée Zellweger as Irene P.

The film earned $90,570,999 in the United States, and a further $58,700,000 internationally for a worldwide total of $149,270,999. =Critical response = Review website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 47%, based on 99 reviews, and an average rating of 5.4/10, with the consensus that \\"While Jim Carrey's comedic skills earn some laughs, Me, Myself and Irene sports a tired, unsatisfying plot.\\" Online review aggregator Metacritic states the film has a score of 49 out of a possible 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". =Controversy= On June 9, 2000, the National Allience for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) sent a letter to 20th Century Fox arguing that the film contains an inaccurate potrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder. In the letter, NAMI executive president Lauire Flynn argued that \\"Me, Myself & Irene perpetuates a myth that schizophrenia-a severe, biologically-based brain disorder-is a split personality\\", and criticized how Fox was \\"seeking to dismiss such concerns with claims that the film is 'only a comedy,'\\", stating that \\"for millions of Americans, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses are no laughing matter\\". NAMI asked Fox to release Public Service Announcements explaining real-life schizophrenia and DID, as well as Jim Carrey to explain the differences between schizophrenia and DID during interviews promoting the film.

He co-founded what became the Marshall Field & Company retail empire.Wendt, Lloyd, Give the Lady What She Wants! The Story of Marshall Field & Co., Rand McNally, 1952Twyman, Robert W., History of Marshall Field & Co., 1852-1906, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1954 Early life  Leiter was born to Anne (née Ziegler) and Joseph Thomas Leiter, of Leitersburg, the Washington County, Maryland, town founded by his grandfather, Abraham Leiter's brother Andrew Leiter (Bell, 184). Although some have confused Leiter's ancestry as Jewish (likely because of his first name), his family was of German Swiss descent and some of his ancestors had been Mennonites. Leiter was raised a Lutheran. Career As a boy, Leiter worked for a dry goods business in Springfield, Ohio. In 1853 he began working as a bookkeeper at Chicago's then-largest dry goods company, Cooley, Wadsworth & Co., where he worked alongside Marshall Field and Potter Palmer. Leiter and Field became partners in the firm, but in 1865, they sold their interest in the company to John V. Farwell and went into business, along with Palmer, as Field, Palmer, Leiter & Co. In 1867, Palmer left his business to pursue real estate ventures, and the company was renamed Field, Leiter & Co. Field & Leiter built a six-story store on State Street in 1868. It was rebuilt after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. From 1874 to 1880, Leiter was a member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Relief and Aid Society, which helped collect and distribute funds to rebuild Chicago after the fire. When Leiter sold his interest to Field and retired from the dry goods business in 1881, the name was changed to Marshall Field and Company. As Leiter's wealth increased, he invested much of his savings in Chicago real estate. After retirement from Field, Leiter & Co., he devoted his attention to real estate and corporate interests. He later devoted time to travel and philanthropy. He was the first president of the Commercial Club of Chicago, the second president of the Chicago Art Institute, a president of the Chicago Historical Society, and a prominent figure in the Illinois Trust Company. From 1892 to 1898, his son Joseph was his agent. Joseph attempted to corner the wheat market from 1897 to 1898, and was briefly the largest individual holder of wheat in the history of the grain trade. Concerted action by his competitors broke the corner. Levi paid millions of dollars to settle Joseph's debts after the market crashed in 1898. Levi's losses were reputed to run to $10 million. Joseph was later president of the Zeigler Coal Company, Chicago, and of the Chicago, Zeigler and Gulf Railway Company; and a director of the American Security and Trust Company. Personal life In 1866, Leiter married Mary Theresa Carver (1844–1913) of Chicago. From 1885 until her death, she served as the second Vice Regent for Illinois in the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, which is occupied with the preservation of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate. Together, they were the parents of: * Joseph Leiter (1868–1932), who graduated from Harvard University in 1891 and who married Juliette Williams (1887–1942). * Mary Victoria Leiter (1870–1906), who married the British Conservative statesman George Curzon, later 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, in 1895. * Nancy Lathrop Carver Leiter (1873–1930), the sponsor of USS Illinois (BB-7) who married Colin Powys Campbell (1859–1923). * Margaret Hyde Leiter (1880–1968), who married Henry Molineux Howard (1877–1917), the 19th Earl of Suffolk and 12th Earl of Berkshire. Leiter died of heart disease at the Vanderbilt family cottage in Bar Harbor, Maine on June 9, 1904. His estate became the subject of eight years of litigation. =Washington residence= In 1891, Leiter had a mansion built adjacent to Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C.. The home was designed by Theophilus Chandler. After his death, his Washington, D.C. home was used for elaborate parties hosted by his widow. During WWII, the mansion was leased to the U.S. Government for office space. The property was sold and the structure demolished in 1947. The site is now the location of the Dupont Hotel. =Descendants= Through his eldest daughter, he was the maternal grandfather of Mary Irene, Lady Ravensdale (b. 1896); Lady Cynthia Curzon (b. 1898), the first wife of Sir Oswald Mosley; and Alexandra Naldera Curzon (b. 1904), the wife of Edward Dudley Metcalfe, the best friend, best man and equerry of King Edward VIII. Through his daughter Margaret, he was the maternal grandfather of Charles Howard, 20th Earl of Suffolk (1906–1941); Hon. Cecil John Arthur Howard (1908–1985), married Frances Dean; and Lt.-Cdr. Hon.

He has been named Newspaper Commentator of the Year in the BBC's What the Papers Say awards, and has twice received the British Press Award for Specialist Writer of the Year. Kaletsky has been an economic consultant since 1997, providing policy analysis and asset allocation advice to over 800 financial institutions, multinational companies and international organisations through his company, GaveKal, which is co-run with Louis and Charles Gave. He was elected to the governing Council of the Royal Economic Society in 1998. Early life Kaletsky was born in 1952 in Moscow, USSR and also spent his childhood in Poland and Australia. He has lived in England and the US since 1966. Education Kaletsky was educated at Westminster City School, at that time a grammar school in the City of Westminster in central London, followed by King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first class honours degree in Mathematics, and then at Harvard, where he was a Kennedy Memorial Scholar and gained a master's degree in economics. Life and career In 1976, Kaletsky joined The Economist, writing about business and finance. Three years later he moved to the Financial Times, working in a variety of posts including New York Bureau Chief, Washington Correspondent, International Economics Correspondent and Moscow Correspondent. Beginning in 1990, Kaletsky was Economics Editor of The Times, and later became Editor-at- Large. In early 2012, Kaletsky began his new post, in the Analysis and Opinion section of the Reuters online newspaper, where he wrote a weekly column. His articles also appeared in print around the world in the International New York Times. Since early 2015, Kaletsky has been writing for Project Syndicate and Prospect Magazine. He was a full-time journalist for The Times, The Economist, and the Financial Times from 1976 to 1998. He was named Newspaper Commentator of the Year, Economic Journalist of the Year, European Journalist of the Year and Specialist Writer of the Year. By 2012 he was writing a column for The Times of London and serving as editor at large, joining as an economics editor in 1990. In 2012, Kaletsky left the Times of London to become a Reuters columnist. In 2010, Kaletsky suggested the emergence of a new form of capitalism, which he calls Capitalism 4.0.

According to legend, Bean and his clan members would eventually be caught by a search party sent by King James VI and executed for their heinous crimes. The story appeared in The Newgate Calendar, a crime catalogue of Newgate Prison in London. The legend lacks sufficient evidence to be deemed as factual by historians, and there is debate as to why the legend would have been fictionalized. Nevertheless, the myth of \\"Sawney\\" Bean has passed into local folklore and has become part of the Edinburgh tourism circuit. Legend According to The Newgate Calendar, a tabloid publication from the 18th and 19th centuries, Alexander Bean was born in East Lothian during the 16th century. His father was a ditch-digger and hedge-trimmer and Bean tried to take up the family trade, but quickly realized that he was not fit for this work. He left home with an ‘allegedly” vicious woman named \\"Black\\" Agnes Douglas, who apparently shared his inclinations and was accused of being a witch. After some robbing and the cannibalization of one of their victims, the couple ended up at a coastal cave in Bennane Head between Girvan and Ballantrae. The cave was 182.88 meters deep, and the entrance was blocked by water during high tide, so the couple were able to live there undiscovered for some 25 years. Sawney and Agnes produced eight sons, six daughters, 18 grandsons and 14 granddaughters. Various grandchildren were products of incest between their children. Lacking the inclination for regular labour, the Bean clan thrived by laying careful ambushes at night to rob and murder individuals or small groups. The clan brought the bodies back to their cave where the corpses were dismembered and eaten. They pickled the leftovers in barrels. The clan discarded body parts, which would sometimes wash up on nearby beaches. This strategy was used to help conceal their crimes and lead villagers to believe that it was animals who were attacking travelers. The body parts and disappearances did not go unnoticed by the local villagers, but the Bean clan stayed in their cave by day and took their victims at night. The Bean clan was so secretive that the villagers were unaware of the murderers living nearby. As local people began to take notice of the disappearances more significantly, several organized searches were launched to find the culprits. One search took note of the cave but the men refused to believe anything human could live in it. Frustrated and in a frenetic quest for justice, the townspeople lynched several innocents, but the disappearances continued. Suspicion often fell on local innkeepers since they were the last known to have seen many of the missing people alive. One fateful night, the Bean clan ambushed a married couple riding from a fayre on one horse, but the man was skilled in combat, thus he deftly held off the clan with sword and pistol. The Bean clan fatally mauled the wife when she fell to the ground in the conflict. Before they could take the resilient husband, a large group of fayre-goers appeared on the trail and the Beans fled. The fayre-goers took the survivor to the local magistrate, whom they informed of this experience. With the Beans' existence finally revealed, it was not long before the King (perhaps James VI of Scotland in tales linked to the 16th century, though it is less clear who this could be in other tales from the 15th century) heard of the atrocities and decided to lead a search with a team of 400 men and several bloodhounds. They soon found the Bean clan's previously overlooked cave in Bennane Head thanks to the bloodhounds. Upon entering the cave by torchlight, the searchers found the Bean clan surrounded by human remains with some body parts hanging from the wall, barrels filled with limbs, and piles of stolen heirlooms and jewellery. There were two versions on what happened next: * The most common of the two is that the Bean clan was captured alive where they gave up without a fight. They were taken in chains to the Tolbooth Jail in Edinburgh, then transferred to Leith or Glasgow where they were promptly executed without trial as people saw them as subhuman and unfit for one. Sawney and his fellow men had their genitalia cut off and thrown into the fires, their hands and feet severed, and were allowed to bleed to death, with Sawney shouting his dying words: \\"It isn't over, it will never be over.\\" After watching the men die, Agnes, her fellow women, and the children were tied to stakes and burned alive. These execution practices recall, in essence if not in detail, the punishments of hanging, drawing, and quartering decreed for men convicted of treason. In contrast, women convicted of the same were burned. * There was another claim that the search party placed gunpowder at the entrance of their cave, where the Sawney Bean Clan faced the fate of suffocation. The town of Girvan, located near the macabre scene of murder and debauchery, has another legend about the Bean clan. There are claims that one of Bean's daughters eventually left the clan and settled in Girvan where she planted a Dule tree that became known as \\"The Hairy Tree.\\" After her family's capture and exposure, the daughter's identity was revealed by angry locals who hanged her from the bough of the Hairy Tree.  Sources and veracity  According to The Scotsman, there is a debate over the validity of the Sawney Bean tale. Some people believe that Sawney Bean was a real person, while others think he was just a mythical figure. Dorothy L. Sayers offered a gruesome account of the Sawney Bean tale in her anthology Great Short Stories of Detection, Mystery and Horror (Gollancz, 1928. The book was a best-seller in Britain, reprinted seven times in the next five years.)http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1066965 A 2005 article by Sean Thomas notes that historical documents, such as newspapers and diaries during the era in which Sawney Bean was supposedly active, make no mention of ongoing disappearances of hundreds of people. Additionally, Thomas notes inconsistencies in the stories but speculates that kernels of truth might have inspired the legend: The Sawney Bean legend closely resembles the story of Christie-Cleek, which is attested much earlier in the early 15th century. Christine-Cleek is a mythical Scottish cannibal who lived during a famine in the mid-fourteenth century. The legend of Sawney Bean first appeared in the British chapbooks (rumour magazines of the day). Today, many argue that the story was a political propaganda tool to denigrate the Scots after the Jacobite rebellions. Thomas disagrees, noting: Another cannibal story from Scotland, even more redolent of the Sawney Bean tale than the Christie-Cleek story, can be found in the 1696 work of Nathaniel Crouch, a compiler and popular history writer who published under the pseudonym \\"Richard Burton.\\" In this tale, the following happened in 1459, the year before James II of Scotland's death: Hector Boece notes that the infant daughter of a Scot brigand, who was executed with his family for cannibalism, though raised by foster parents, developed the cannibal appetite at 12, and was put to death for it. This was summarised by George M. Gould and Walter Pyle in Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine. Popular culture * Wes Craven used Sawney Bean as the inspiration for his film The Hills Have Eyes. * Sawney Bean is used as direct inspiration for the name of two titans in the manga and anime series Attack on Titan written by Hajime Isayama. *The legend's influence can also be seen in the films Ravenous and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/sawney_bean.shtml The Grisly Deeds of Alexander Bean The BBC * In the Image comics series Hack/Slash, the main character Vlad (a.k.a. \\"The Meatman Killer\\") is eventually revealed to be a descendant of Sawney Bean.

Sometimes placed in a family of their own, the Eucryphiaceae, more recent classifications place them in the Cunoniaceae. There are seven species, two in South America and five in Australia, and several named hybrids. Description They are mostly evergreen though one species (E. glutinosa) is usually deciduous. The leaves are opposite, and either simple or pinnate with 3-13 leaflets. The flowers are produced in late summer or autumn, are showy and sweetly scented, 3–6 cm diameter, with four creamy-white petals, and numerous stamens and styles. The fruit is a woody capsule 1-1.5 cm long containing several seeds, and maturing in 12–15 months. =Honey= The nectar of two of the species provides an important sources of honey. Eucryphia lucida from Tasmania is the main source of a very distinctively flavoured honey known as Leatherwood (the common name for the species). Some of this honey may come from the other Tasmanian species, E. milliganii. In Chile, Ulmo honey (again after the local species name) comes from E. cordifolia. Leatherwood honey and Ulmo honey are very similar in flavour, even though the two species have probably been separated for more than 45 million years. The generic name is derived from the Greek for \\"well hidden\\". Species *Eucryphia cordifolia Cav. – Valdivian temperate rain forests of southern Chile and Argentina. A tree growing up to 40 m tall; leaves simple, crenate to serrated, evergreen, 3–7 cm long. Its wood is used for construction, furniture and lumber, and its nectar for honey. *Eucryphia glutinosa (Poepp. & Endl.) Baill. – Valdivian temperate rain forests of southern Chile. A large shrub to 7 m tall; leaves pinnate, with 3-5 leaflets, serrated, deciduous or semi-evergreen, 3–6 cm long. *Eucryphia jinksii P.I.Forst. – subtropical New South Wales & Queensland mountain rainforests endemic, Australia. A tree to 25 m tall; leaves simple or with 3 leaflets, entire, evergreen, 5–10 cm long (discovered 1994). *Eucryphia lucida (Labill.) Baill. – Tasmania Australia. A tree to 20–30 m tall; leaves simple, entire, evergreen, 3–7 cm long. Common name is Tasmanian leatherwood and it is a major commercial source of monofloral honey. *Eucryphia milliganii Hook.f.

Uses The species and their hybrids are attractive small trees for gardens, typically with a slender conic crown when young, though widening with age. They are valued for their conspicuous scented flowers, produced in late summer and autumn when few or no other trees are in flower. Cultivation is restricted to areas with mild winters, cool summers and good rainfall; away from their native areas, this restricts them to the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe, the Pacific Northwest of North America, and New Zealand.

These codes can encode a message into a number of symbols such that knowledge of any fraction of them allows one to recover the original message (with high probability). Rateless codes produce an arbitrarily large number of symbols which can be broadcast until the receivers have enough symbols. High level view of the use of online codes The online encoding algorithm consists of several phases. First the message is split into n fixed size message blocks. Then the outer encoding is an erasure code which produces auxiliary blocks that are appended to the message blocks to form a composite message. From this the inner encoding generates check blocks. Upon receiving a certain number of check blocks some fraction of the composite message can be recovered. Once enough has been recovered the outer decoding can be used to recover the original message. Detailed discussion Online codes are parameterised by the block size and two scalars, q and ε. The authors suggest q=3 and ε=0.01. These parameters set the balance between the complexity and performance of the encoding. A message of n blocks can be recovered, with high probability, from (1+3ε)n check blocks. The probability of failure is (ε/2)q+1. =Outer encoding= Any erasure code may be used as the outer encoding, but the author of online codes suggest the following. For each message block, pseudo-randomly choose q auxiliary blocks (from a total of 0.55qεn auxiliary blocks) to attach it to. Each auxiliary block is then the XOR of all the message blocks which have been attached to it. =Inner encoding= A graph of check blocks received against number of message blocks fixed for a 10000 block message. The inner encoding takes the composite message and generates a stream of check blocks. A check block is the XOR of all the blocks from the composite message that it is attached to. The degree of a check block is the number of blocks that it is attached to. The degree is determined by sampling a random distribution, p, which is defined as: :F=\\\\left\\\\lceil\\\\frac{\\\\ln(\\\\epsilon^2/4)}{\\\\ln(1-\\\\epsilon/2)}\\\\right\\\\rceil :p_1=1-\\\\frac{1+1/F}{1+\\\\epsilon} :p_i=\\\\frac{(1-p_1)F}{(F-1)i(i-1)} for 2\\\\le i\\\\le F Once the degree of the check block is known, the blocks from the composite message which it is attached to are chosen uniformly. =Decoding= Obviously the decoder of the inner stage must hold check blocks which it cannot currently decode. A check block can only be decoded when all but one of the blocks which it is attached to are known. The graph to the left shows the progress of an inner decoder. The x-axis plots the number of check blocks received and the dashed line shows the number of check blocks which cannot currently be used. This climbs almost linearly at first as many check blocks with degree > 1 are received but unusable. At a certain point, some of the check blocks are suddenly usable, resolving more blocks which then causes more check blocks to be usable. Very quickly the whole file can be decoded. As the graph also shows the inner decoder falls just shy of decoding everything for a little while after having received n check blocks. The outer encoding ensures that a few elusive blocks from the inner decoder are not an issue, as the file can be recovered without them.

The village has a population of 515 (2001). Overview The name Horton is a common one in England. It derives from Old English horu 'dirt' and tūn 'settlement, farm, estate', presumably meaning 'farm on muddy soil'. The earliest reference to the one in Dorset is in a charter of 946 ACE, albeit surviving only in a fourteenth-century copy, which mentions 'oþ hore tuninge gemære' ('to the boundary of the people of Horton').Victor Watts (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place Names, Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v. HORTON. The village has two unusual buildings: the Horton Tower, a five storey gothic red brick observatory designed by Humphrey Sturt whose principal purpose now is that of a disguised mobile phone mast for operator Vodafone, and the 18th century Georgian church of St Wolfrida, built on the site of the tenth century Horton Priory.

Ltd. was an Edinburgh industrial electrical engineering company. Early history The company was founded as D. Bruce Peebles & Co. by Scottish engineer David Bruce Peebles (1826–1899) in Edinburgh in 1866. The company initially specialised in gas engineering but later expanded to include electrical engineering as well. It continued to trade after Peebles' death and, in 1902, the name was changed to Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd. The company held the British manufacturing rights for the Cascade converter and a licence to manufacture three-phase electrical equipment designed by Ganz of Budapest. Canadian Electric Traction Company In 1903, Peebles expanded into Canada. Along with other investors, it formed the Canadian Electric Traction Company and supplied the three-phase equipment, car motors and generators for the South Western Traction Company of London, Ontario. The main line ran 28-miles between London and Port Stanley, a resort town on Lake Erie. It was the only three-phase traction line in Canada, and was closed in 1918. New factory In 1904 the company opened a new factory at a site in East Pilton, Edinburgh, employing 3,000 at its peak in the 1950s. The works had its own internal railway system, which was electrified and used electric shunting locomotives built by Peebles themselves. This was the first electric line in Edinburgh (main line electrification did not reach Edinburgh until the early 1990s). In 1905 the company was exhibiting at the Third International Electric Tramway and Railway Exhibition.The Electrical journal, Volume 55 It also manufactured at least one (from an order of ten) electric locomotives for the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway. War work During both World Wars, the works produced shells, submarine and aircraft parts, tank and electrical equipment such as mobile search lights and minesweeping units. Woodhead Line electrification It was the main sub contractor for the electrification of the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield from 1947–1954, a major engineering achievement. Throughout this period it specialised in large scale transformers for power stations, including the world's largest 400 kV 'quadrature booster' for the UK national grid. It also produced heavy electric motors for various uses, including railway locomotives. Ownership changes The company became part of the Reyrolle Parsons Group in 1969, part of Northern Engineering Industries in 1977 and part of Rolls Royce plc in 1989. Many young electrical engineers were taken on by this company, with a special course in electrical engineering being run at the nearby Telford College. They gained skills in highly specialised work, and Peebles' products were exported all over the world. The late Ron Brown, MP for Leith, was employed by the company, as was the late Sir Duncan McDonald who was the chief transformer designer. The business divided In 1998 the business was split, with the Peebles Electrical Machine Division (Motors & Generators) being acquired by Pope (Australia) and the Transformer Division going to the Austrian company VA Tech. =Transformer division= In April 1999 a substantial fire destroyed the main transformer works in East Pilton. The company decided that a replacement factory should be relocated to Leith Docks to better facilitate transfer of the largest transformers onto ships for export. The Pilton site was sold for residential redevelopment. VA Tech closed the Leith factory during 2005 and continued service work only. The entire VA Tech company became part of Siemens that year. =Motors & Generators division= The motors & generators business relocated to Wood Road in the nearby Rosyth dockyard. Parsons Peebles Motor & Generators was acquired by Clyde Blowers Capital in January 2013. The company is still located in the Royal dockyard Rosyth and continues to manufacture and service specialised motors and generators.

On 6 May 1988, Widerøe Flight 710 from Namsos to Brønnøysund crashed into the side of the mountain, and all 36 passengers and crew died. Tunnel According to legend, the hole was made by the troll Hestmannen while he was chasing the beautiful girl Lekamøya. As the troll realized he would not get the girl, he released an arrow to kill her, but the troll-king of Sømna threw his hat into the arrow's path to save her. The hat turned into the mountain with a hole in the middle. Also, Felice Vinci has linked the legends about Torghatten to the Homeric myth of Polyphemus. The tunnel is long, wide, and high. It was formed during the Scandinavian ice age. Ice and water eroded the looser rocks, while the harder ones in the mountain top have resisted erosion.

Any pairing function can be used in set theory to prove that integers and rational numbers have the same cardinality as natural numbers. In theoretical computer science they are used to encode a function defined on a vector of natural numbers f : \\\\mathbb{N}^{k} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{N} into a new function g: \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{N}. Definition A pairing function is a computable bijection :\\\\pi:\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}.  Cantor pairing function  The Cantor pairing function assigns one natural number to each pair of natural numbers The Cantor pairing function is a primitive recursive pairing function :\\\\pi:\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} defined by :\\\\pi(k_1,k_2) := \\\\frac{1}{2}(k_1 + k_2)(k_1 + k_2 + 1)+k_2. The statement that this is the only quadratic pairing function is known as the Fueter–Pólya theorem. Whether this is the only polynomial pairing function is still an open question. When we apply the pairing function to and we often denote the resulting number as . This definition can be inductively generalized to the Cantor tuple function :\\\\pi^{(n)}:\\\\mathbb{N}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} for n > 2 as :\\\\pi^{(n)}(k_1, \\\\ldots, k_{n-1}, k_n) := \\\\pi ( \\\\pi^{(n-1)}(k_1, \\\\ldots, k_{n-1}) , k_n) with the base case defined above for a pair: \\\\pi^{(2)}(k_1,k_2) := \\\\pi(k_1,k_2). = Inverting the Cantor pairing function = Let z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} be an arbitrary natural number. We will show that there exist unique values x, y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} such that : z = \\\\pi(x, y) = \\\\frac{(x + y + 1)(x + y)}{2} + y and hence that is invertible. It is helpful to define some intermediate values in the calculation: : w = x + y \\\\\\\\! : t = \\\\frac{1}{2}w(w + 1) = \\\\frac{w^2 + w}{2} : z = t + y \\\\\\\\! where is the triangle number of . If we solve the quadratic equation : w^2 + w - 2t = 0 \\\\\\\\! for as a function of , we get : w = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{8t + 1} - 1}{2} which is a strictly increasing and continuous function when is non-negative real. Since : t \\\\leq z = t + y < t + (w + 1) = \\\\frac{(w + 1)^2 + (w + 1)}{2} we get that : w \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{8z + 1} - 1}{2} < w + 1 and thus : w = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{8z + 1} - 1}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor. where is the floor function. So to calculate and from , we do: : w = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{8z + 1} - 1}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor : t = \\\\frac{w^2 + w}{2} : y = z - t \\\\\\\\! : x = w - y. \\\\\\\\!

To find and such that : :, :, :, :, :, :, so ; :, :, :, so ; :, so ; :, so ; thus . = Derivation = A diagonally incrementing \\"snaking\\" function, from same principles as Cantor's pairing function, is often used to demonstrate the countability of the rational numbers. The graphical shape of Cantor's pairing function, a diagonal progression, is a standard trick in working with infinite sequences and countability.The term \\"diagonal argument\\" is sometimes used to refer to this type of enumeration, but it is not directly related to Cantor's diagonal argument. The algebraic rules of this diagonal- shaped function can verify its validity for a range of polynomials, of which a quadratic will turn out to be the simplest, using the method of induction. Indeed, this same technique can also be followed to try and derive any number of other functions for any variety of schemes for enumerating the plane. A pairing function can usually be defined inductively – that is, given the th pair, what is the th pair? The way Cantor's function progresses diagonally across the plane can be expressed as :\\\\pi(x,y)+1 = \\\\pi(x-1,y+1). The function must also define what to do when it hits the boundaries of the 1st quadrant – Cantor's pairing function resets back to the x-axis to resume its diagonal progression one step further out, or algebraically: :\\\\pi(0,k)+1 = \\\\pi(k+1,0). Also we need to define the starting point, what will be the initial step in our induction method: . Assume that there is a quadratic 2-dimensional polynomial that can fit these conditions (if there were not, one could just repeat by trying a higher-degree polynomial). The general form is then :\\\\pi(x,y) = ax^2+by^2+cxy+dx+ey+f. Plug in our initial and boundary conditions to get and: :bk^2+ek+1 = a(k+1)^2+d(k+1), so we can match our terms to get : : :. So every parameter can be written in terms of except for , and we have a final equation, our diagonal step, that will relate them: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\pi(x,y)+1 &= a(x^2+y^2) + cxy + (1-a)x + (1+a)y + 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a((x-1)^2+(y+1)^2) + c(x-1)(y+1) + (1-a)(x-1) + (1+a)(y+1). \\\\end{align} Expand and match terms again to get fixed values for and , and thus all parameters: : : : :. Therefore :\\\\begin{align} \\\\pi(x,y) &= \\\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2) + xy + \\\\frac{1}{2}x + \\\\frac{3}{2}y \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{2}(x+y)(x+y+1) + y, \\\\end{align} is the Cantor pairing function, and we also demonstrated through the derivation that this satisfies all the conditions of induction.

Also includes Rodolphe Audette's translation into . Inter Gravissimas prepared for ISO TC 154 The document, written in Latin, reformed the Julian calendar. The reform came to be regarded as a new calendar in its own right and came to be called the Gregorian calendar, which is used in most countries today. Description The intention expressed by the text of this bull was \\"to restore\\" the calendar so that seasonal events critical for the calculation of Easter dates would be back in their \\"proper places\\" and would be prevented from being moved away again. The idea of reform as such is not otherwise mentioned. The bull identifies \\"three necessary\\" things for the correct determination of Easter dates: correct placement of the northern vernal equinox; correct identification of the \\"14th day of the moon\\" (effectively full moon) that happens on or next after the vernal equinox, and the first Sunday that follows that full moon. The first two items were the ones that received attention; the third, about choosing the next following Sunday, was not identified as causing any problem, and was not further mentioned. By \\"restore\\", Gregory meant two things. First, he adjusted the calendar so that the vernal equinox was near March 21, where it had been during the Council of Nicaea (May 20 – August 25, 325). This required removing ten days of drift. Second, he made the tabular 14th day of the moon correspond with the real full moon, removing \\"four days and more\\" of drift. This would restore the dates of Easter to near where they were at the time of the Council of Nicaea, although that council had not specified where in the calendar the vernal equinox should fall and had not adopted any particular type of lunar tables. The practices of the Roman Catholic Church that had become traditional by 1582 for calculating the Easter and lunar calendars became settled when Dionysius Exiguus translated the rules of the Church of Alexandria from Greek into Latin in 525. (Northumbria adopted them at Whitby in 664, the Welsh around 768, and France around 775. Before this, France and Rome had used Victorius's less exact 457 translation of the Alexandrian calendar; Britain and Rome before Victorius had used Augustalis's 84-year cycle.) Gregory also made changes to the calendar rules, intending to ensure that, in the future, the equinox and the 14th day of the Paschal moon, and consequently Easter Sunday, would not move away again from what the bull called their proper places. The changes (relative to the Julian calendar) were as follows: # Reduction of the number of leap years - centennial years, such as 1700, 1800, and 1900 ceased to be leap years, but years that can be divided by 400, such as 1600 and 2000 continued to be; # Turning back extra days - October 4, 1582, was to be followed by October 15, 1582, and these 10 missing days were not to be counted in calculating end days of loans, taxes etc.; # Easter was to be computed with reference not only to the new March 21, but also by the use of new Paschal tables. The name of the bull consists of the first two words of the bull, which starts: \\"Inter gravissimas pastoralis officii nostri curas…\\" (\\"Among the most serious duties of our pastoral office…\\"). The bull refers to \\"the explanation of our calendar\\" and to a canon related to the dominical letter. To accompany the bull there were six chapters of explanatory rules ('canons'),Les textes constitutifs du calendrier grégorien (bull, canons, and calendars) and some of these (canons 1, 2, 4) refer to a book entitled Liber novæ rationis restituendi calendarii Romani G Moyer (1983), \\"Aloisius Lilius and the 'Compendium novae rationis restituendi kalendarium'\\", pages 171-188 in G.V. Coyne (ed.), The Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican conference to commemorate its 400th anniversary (Vatican City: Specola Vaticana), 1983. for a fuller explanation of the tables than that contained in the canons (or the bull). Because the bull and canons refer to each other, they must have been written at roughly the same time, printed at the same time (March 1), and distributed to the several countries together. These canons enabled the computation of Easter dates in the reformed ('restored') Gregorian calendar, and gave two calendar-listings saints' days, one for the 'year of correction' (1582) and another for the entire new Gregorian year. The bull, canons, and calendars were reprinted as part of the principal book explaining and defending the Gregorian calendar, Christoph Clavius, Romani calendarii a Gregorio XIII. P. M. restituti explicatio (1603),\\"Inter gravissimas\\" in Christoph Clavius, Romani calendarii a Gregorio XIII. P. M. restituti explicatio, 1603. The bull begins on page 53, counting from the front cover. The title page is page 5. which is tome V in his collected works Opera Mathematica (1612).Opera Mathematica of Christoph Clavius Go to Page, Go To Specific Page, Work: Roman Calendar of Gregory XIII, Page: Calendar – Page 13. The fifth volume contains his works on the Gregorian calendar. Date The version of \\"Inter gravissimas\\" included by Christoph Clavius in his work explaining the Gregorian calendar contained these dating clauses: \\"Anno Incarnationis Dominicae M. D. LXXXI. Sexto Calend. Martij, Pontificatus nostri Anno Decimo. ... Anno à Natiuitate Domini nostri Iesu Christi Millesimo Quingentesimo Octuagesimo secundo Indictione decima,\\". These clauses include four years: *\\"Anno Incarnationis Dominicae M. D. LXXXI.\\" (In the year of the Incarnation of the Lord 1581) is the year beginning . is the traditional date of the conception, annunciation, and incarnation of Jesus. *\\"Sexto Calend. Martij\\" (On the sixth [day] before the Kalends [1st] of March.) The Romans counted inclusively; modern usage would say the fifth day before 1 March, or 24 February. *\\"Pontificatus nostri Anno Decimo\\" (In the tenth year of our pontificate) is the year beginning . Gregory XIII was elected pope on (in terms of the Julian calendar). *\\"Anno à Natiuitate Domini nostri Iesu Christi Millesimo Quingentesimo Octuagesimo secundo\\" (In the year from the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ 1582) is the year beginning using the modern beginning of the year. It marks the beginning of year 1582 if that year began on , the traditional date of the birth or nativity of Jesus. *\\"Indictione decima\\" (Indiction 10) is the year beginning , which agrees with modern reckoning. All of these years agree that the bull was dated February 24, 1582, using the modern beginning of the year. Adoption Gregory's reform was enacted in the most solemn of forms available to the Church, but the bull had no authority beyond the Catholic Church and the Papal States. The changes which Gregory was proposing included changes to the civil calendar over which Gregory had no authority (except in the Papal States). The text of the bull recognized this by giving what amounted to orders to the clergy and those \\"presiding over churches\\": but in contrast, where the text addresses the civil authorities (\\"kings, princes and republics\\"), it \\"asks\\", \\"exhorts\\" and \\"recommends\\" the new calendar changes. The changes required adoption by the civil authorities in each country to have legal effect. The bull Inter gravissimas was immediately adopted by the major Catholic powers of Europe, but the Protestant countries refused to adopt it until the 18th century, and Eastern European countries adopted it only during or after World War I (the last European country to adopt it was Greece, in 1923). Most Eastern Orthodox Churches and Oriental Orthodox Churches have not adopted it at all and continue to reckon their ecclesiastical years by the Julian calendar, even though their home countries use the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes.

The station was established in Atlanta, Georgia in 1948. Though WDIA in Memphis was on the air a year earlier carrying black-oriented programming, the station was not owned by African Americans. Jesse B. Blayton Sr., an accountant, bank president, and Atlanta University professor, purchased WERD in 1949 for $50,000. He changed the station format to \\"black appeal\\" and hired his son Jesse Jr. as station manager. \\"Jockey\\" Jack Gibson was hired soon after, and by 1951 was the most popular DJ in Atlanta. The station was housed in the Masonic building on Auburn Avenue, then one of the wealthiest black neighborhoods in the United States. Located in that same building was the headquarters of the new Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by Martin Luther King Jr. It has been said that King would beat the roof of the office with a broomstick as a signal to send the microphone down when he wanted to make public addresses.

Thermoforming is a manufacturing process where a plastic sheet is heated to a pliable forming temperature, formed to a specific shape in a mold, and trimmed to create a usable product. The sheet, or \\"film\\" when referring to thinner gauges and certain material types, is heated in an oven to a high-enough temperature that permits it to be stretched into or onto a mold and cooled to a finished shape. Its simplified version is vacuum forming. In its simplest form, a small tabletop or lab size machine can be used to heat small cut sections of plastic sheet and stretch it over a mold using vacuum. This method is often used for sample and prototype parts. In complex and high-volume applications, very large production machines are utilized to heat and form the plastic sheet and trim the formed parts from the sheet in a continuous high- speed process and can produce many thousands of finished parts per hour depending on the machine and mold size and the size of the parts being formed. Thermoforming differs from injection molding, blow molding, rotational molding and other forms of processing plastics. Thin-gauge thermoforming is primarily the manufacture of disposable cups, containers, lids, trays, blisters, clamshells, and other products for the food, medical, and general retail industries. Thick-gauge thermoforming includes parts as diverse as vehicle door and dash panels, refrigerator liners, utility vehicle beds and plastic pallets. In the most common method of high-volume, continuous thermoforming of thin-gauge products, plastic sheet is fed from a roll or from an extruder into a set of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and transport it through an oven for heating to forming temperature. The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (Plug-assists are typically used in addition to vacuum in the case of taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas. The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web or indexes into a separate trim press where the formed parts are trimmed. The sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling. Most thermoforming companies recycle their scrap and waste plastic, either by compressing in a baling machine or by feeding into a granulator (grinder) and producing ground flake, for sale to reprocessing companies or re-use in their own facility. Frequently, scrap and waste plastic from the thermoforming process is converted back into extruded sheet for forming again. Thin-gauge and heavy-gauge (thick) thermoforming There are two general thermoforming process categories. Sheet thickness less than 1.5 mm (0.060 inches) is usually delivered to the thermoforming machine from rolls or from a sheet extruder. Thin-gauge roll-fed or inline extruded thermoforming applications are dominated by rigid or semi-rigid disposable packaging. Sheet thicknesses greater than 3 mm (0.120 inches) are usually delivered to the forming machine by hand or an auto-feed method already cut to final dimensions. Heavy, or thick-gauge, cut sheet thermoforming applications are primarily used as permanent structural components. There is a small but growing medium-gauge market that forms sheet 1.5 mm to 3 mm in thickness. Heavy-gauge forming utilizes the same basic process as continuous thin-gauge sheet forming, typically draping the heated plastic sheet over a mold. Many heavy-gauge forming applications use vacuum only in the form process, although some use two halves of mating form tooling and include air pressure to help form. Aircraft windscreens and machine gun turret windows spurred the advance of heavy-gauge forming technology during World War II. Heavy-gauge parts are used as cosmetic surfaces on permanent structures such as kiosks, automobiles, trucks, medical equipment, material handling equipment, refrigerators, spas, and shower enclosures, and electrical and electronic equipment. Unlike most thin-gauge thermoformed parts, heavy-gauge parts are often hand-worked after forming for trimming to final shape or for additional drilling, cutting, or finishing, depending on the product. Heavy-gauge products typically are of a \\"permanent\\" end use nature, while thin-gauge parts are more often designed to be disposable or recyclable and are primarily used to package or contain a food item or product. Heavy-gauge thermoforming is typically used for production quantities of 250 to 3000 annually, with lower tooling costs and faster product development than competing plastic technologies like injection molding. Engineering Thermoforming has benefited from applications of engineering technology[3], although the basic forming process is very similar to what was invented many years ago. Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheets into an inline trim station for more precise trim registration has been improved due to the common use of electric servo motors for chain indexing versus air cylinders, gear racks, and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the machine platens where form and trim tooling are mounted, rather than air cylinders which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling. Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat.. A new technology, ToolVu, has been developed to provide real-time feedback on thermoformer machines[7]. This stand-alone system connects directly to the thermoformer and utilizes multiple sensors to record production-run data in real time including air pressure, temperature, tool strain gauge and other specifications. The system sends out multiple warnings and alerts whenever pre-set production parameters are compromised during a run. This reduces machine down time, lowers startup time and decreases startup scrap. An integral part of the thermoforming process is the tooling, which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy- gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically, thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited to the quality of the tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling. Types of molds * plaster of paris mold * wooden mold * plastic mold * aluminium mold Industry The more than US\\\\$10 billion North American market has traditionally been ¾ thin gauge and ¼ heavy gauge. In 2003 there were about 150 thin-gauge thermoformers in North America. Sixty percent formed proprietary products. Thirty percent were custom formers and 10 percent were OEMs with in-house forming capability. There were nearly a dozen thin-gauge formers having annual sales of at least US\\\\$100 million. The largest had annual sales in excess of US\\\\$1,000 million. There were about 250 heavy-gauge formers in North America. Nearly all were custom formers. Only two or three heavy-gauge formers had annual sales of more than US\\\\$100 million. The largest had annual sales of about US\\\\$140 million.[2] Beaverton, Michigan, is known as the Plastic Thermoforming capital of the world fueled by the proximity of Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Michigan.

This process can be used to form plastic into permanent objects such as turnpike signs and protective covers. Normally draft angles are present in the design of the mold (a recommended minimum of 3°) to ease removal of the formed plastic part from the mold. Relatively deep parts can be formed if the formable sheet is mechanically or pneumatically stretched prior to bringing it into contact with the mold surface and applying the vacuum.J.L. Throne, Understanding Thermoforming, Hanser Gardner Publications, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, 1999 Suitable materials for use in vacuum forming are conventionally thermoplastics. The most common and easiest to use thermoplastic is high impact polystyrene sheeting (HIPS). This is molded around a wood, structural foam or cast or machined aluminium mold, and can form to almost any shape. This high impact material is hygienic and capable of retaining heat and its shape when warm water is applied and is commonly used to package taste and odor sensitive products. Vacuum forming is also appropriate for transparent materials such as acrylic, which are widely used in applications for aerospace such as passenger cabin window canopies for military fixed wing aircraft and compartments for rotary wing aircraft. Vacuum forming is often used in low-level technology classes for an easy way to mold. Modern vacuum-forming equipment is based on a series of US patents awarded in 1950, 1964, and 1974. Typical applications Vacuum formed vehicle part Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) utilize heavy gauge vacuum formed components for production quantities in the range of 250–3000 units per year. Vacuum-formed components can be used in place of complex fabricated sheet metal, fiberglass, or plastic injection molding. Typical industry examples besides product packaging include: fascias for outdoor kiosks and automated teller machines, enclosures for medical imaging and diagnostic equipment, engine covers in a truck cab or for construction equipment, and railcar interior trim and seat components. Vacuum formers are also often used by hobbyists, for applications such as masks and remote control cars.  Common problems  There are some problems encountered in the vacuum forming process. Absorbed moisture can expand, forming bubbles within the plastic's inner layers. This significantly weakens the plastic. However, this can be solved by drying the plastic for an extended period at high but sub-melting temperature. Webs can form around the mold, which is due to overheating the plastic and so must be carefully monitored. Webbing can also occur when a mold is too large or parts of the mold are too close together. Finally, objects that are formed often stick to the mold, which is remedied by using a draft angle of three degrees or more in the mold. Types of molds There are numerous patterns one can make with vacuum forming. The most inventive way to use vacuum forming is to take any small item, replicate it many times and then vacuum form the new pattern to create a more cohesive form. The vacuum forming helps tie the individual pieces together and make one mold out of many pieces that can easily be replicated. From there plaster, concrete, etc. can be cast into the plastic form. Wood patterns are a common material to vacuum form as it is relatively inexpensive and allows the customer to make changes to the design easily. The number of samples that one is able to get from any pattern depends on the size of the part and the thickness of the material. Once the specifications of the part have been met, the pattern is then used to create a ceramic composite mold, or cast aluminum mold for regular production. Potentially, there are ways to create holes in plaster with a vacuum form if the replicated forms made from the vacuum form are deep enough and gaps are left between them for the plastic to form into. Then, once the plastic is used to cast a plaster mold, the deep plastic areas will leave holes if the mold is not completely filled. Cast aluminium molds are cast at a foundry and typically have temperature control lines running through them. This helps to set the heat of the plastic being formed as well as speed up the fabrication process. Aluminium molds can be male or female in nature, and can also be used in pressure forming applications. The main drawback with this type of mold is the cost. Vacuum forming mold made from Aluminium (cavity) and Steel (frame) Machined aluminium molds are like cast aluminium, but are cut out of a solid block of aluminium using a CNC machine and a CAD program. Typically, machined aluminium is used for shallow draw parts out of thin gauge material. Applications may include packaging and trays. Cost is a significant factor with this type of tooling. Composite molds are a lower cost alternative to cast or machined aluminium molds. Composite molds are typically made from filled resins that start as a liquid and harden with time. Depending on the application, composite molds can last a very long time and produce high quality parts. Finishing methods A sheet of vacuum-formed plastic. The pieces needed (in this case parts for a model aeroplane) will need to be cut out of the sheet. Once a vacuum forming has been created out of a sheet of plastic, a finishing operation will be needed in most cases to turn it into a usable product. Common vacuum forming finishing methods include: Guillotining: The product is cut out of the sheet by pressing a blade through the product into a die underneath. This is a clean way of removing vacuum formed parts from the material sheet. It doesn't require a special cutting tool to be made for an individual product and is therefore suitable for low volumes of parts where straight lines are no problem. Cutting only straight lines and being a fairly slow approach compared to other finishing methods, guillotining can be expensive for projects with larger, more complex quantities. Drilling: If simple round holes are the required finish, manually drilling them is a good solution for small quantities. Drilling guides can be used to ensure holes can be drilled quickly in the right place. As this is a labour-intensive method, it is only suitable for small production quantities. Roller cutting: Process whereby the vacuum formed product is placed on a custom made cutter and pushed through a roller cutter machine. An efficient way of cutting vacuum formed items from the original sheet of vacuum forming material. The cutter can also cut any necessary holes, such as cable or access holes, at the same time. Roller cutting is suitable for fairly large items, where precision alignment is not required. As the vacuum formings and the cutter are rolled sideways through the roller cutter machine, some misalignment can occur. Roller cutting can't be used for making holes or features in the sides of vacuum formings, as the cutter tool always cuts vertically from the bottom. Press cutting: This is a very precise method of cutting which uses a press and a custom precision made cutting tool. This method is very suitable for items where the roller cutter process wouldn't achieve the precision required. It's often used for punching very small finished items out of a plastic sheet, rather than punching features into a product. Press cutting can't be used to make features in the sides of vacuum formings. Cutting with a CNC machine: Machining is a very precise method of creating holes & features. The real advantage is that it can be used to create features in the sides of vacuum forming, e.g. guide rails for a tray that needs to slide onto shelving. It can also cut sidewalls of a different depth than the pockets—something which cannot be done with roller or press cutting.Webster, Stephen. Vacuum Forming Market, Stephen Webster Plastics Ltd.

It is designed to be launched off the beach. Dories were generally built by the fisherman themselves in the off season and later by more organized boatyards. The rounded hull provides more buoyancy for launching through surf than the slab sided banks dory. The flat bottom allows the boat to sit upright on the beach. The lack of a keel keeps the boat from being grabbed by a wave and allows the boat to pass cleanly through the surf. The boat still heels easily which allows large fish to be rolled into the boat vs having to lift the fish completely up over the gunnel. The Swampscott dory is a melding of the earlier Wherry design and the river bateau, which later led to new construction techniques used in the mass production of the Banks dory. Swampscott dories are built with rounded sides and slightly less overhang stern than a banks dory. Swampscott dories are generally from 14 to 18 ft in length, the longer boat being rowed by two oarsmen. Eventually the Swampscott dory developed into a recreational sailboat as well, known as the clipper dory, and then the alpha and beachcomber dory. These inexpensive sailboats were raced along the coast of Massachusetts during the early part of the 20th century. The sail rig was typically a Leg of Mutton and small jib on an unstayed mast. Lowell's Boat Shop markets a similar boat as a surf dory. References  Further reading  * Chapelle, Howard I. (1951) American Small Sailing Craft: Their Design, Development and Construction W. W.

Her youngest sister is Tammy Mozes, who currently owns several Israeli companies. She attended Ohel Shem and \\"Hadash\\" high schools. In the Israel Defense Forces she served as an official hostess for different public personalities at Sde Dov Airport in Tel Aviv. Career In 1994, after her mother Paula Mozes died, control of the newspaper was transferred to Judy's brother Arnon Mozes. Together, Judy and Arnon gained control of the newspaper from their youngest sister Tammy, their cousins, and the editor-in-chief editor of the newspaper, Dov Yudkovsky after years of struggle. A few years later Tammy sold her share of the newspaper to Arnon and several other companies. In addition to her family ascription and her family business, Judy has written for years in the weekend edition of Yedioth Ahronoth, \\"7 days,\\" and hosted a TV show on Channel 2, \\"Jude Luck.\\" Today she has a weekly show on Reshet Bet of Kol Yisrael on Fridays at 11 p.m., where she talks about current events in the fields of politics, the economy and entertainment. In April 2005, Nir-Mozes gave Prince Charles a gold talisman from Yitzhak Kaduri as a wedding present on the eve of his marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles. She said she had given a similar talisman to Bill Clinton during his presidency. Judy is also a permanent panel member on the current events program \\"Talking About It From Home\\".

Telephony is supposed to specifically point to a voice-only service or connection, though sometimes the line may blur. Mobile phones connect to a terrestrial cellular network of base stations (cell sites), whereas satellite phones connect to orbiting satellites. Both networks are interconnected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to allow any phone in the world to be dialed. In 2010 there were estimated to be five billion mobile cellular subscriptions in the world.  History  According to internal memos, American Telephone & Telegraph discussed developing a wireless phone in 1915, but were afraid that deployment of the technology could undermine its monopoly on wired service in the U.S. Public mobile phone systems were first introduced in the years after the Second World War and made use of technology developed before and during the conflict. The first system opened in St Louis, Missouri, USA in 1946 whilst other countries followed in the succeeding decades. The UK introduced its 'System 1' manual radiotelephone service as the South Lancashire Radiophone Service in 1958. Calls were made via an operator using handsets identical to ordinary phone handsets. The phone itself was a large box located in the boot (trunk) of the vehicle containing valves and other early electronic components. Although an uprated manual service ('System 3') was extended to cover most of the UK, automation did not arrive until 1981 with 'System 4'. Although this non-cellular service, based on German B-Netz technology, was expanded rapidly throughout the UK between 1982 and 1985 and continued in operation for several years before finally closing in Scotland, it was overtaken by the introduction in January 1985 of two cellular systems - the British Telecom/Securicor 'Cellnet' service and the Racal/Millicom/Barclays 'Vodafone' (from voice + data + phone) service. These cellular systems were based on US Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) technology, the modified technology being named Total Access Communication System (TACS). In 1947, Bell Labs was the first to propose a cellular radio telephone network. The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection. In 1956, the MTA system was launched in Sweden. The early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges: allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped. Both problems were solved by Bell Labs employee Amos Joel who, in 1970 applied for a patent for a mobile communications system.Patent No. 3,663,762, issued May 16, 1972. However, a business consulting firm calculated the entire U.S. market for mobile telephones at 100,000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200,000 units based on the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers. As a consequence, Bell Labs concluded that the invention was \\"of little or no consequence,\\" leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention. The invention earned Joel induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008.List of National Inventors Hall of Fame inductees The development of metal-oxide- semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) technology, information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications. The first call on a handheld mobile phone was made on April 3, 1973 by Martin Cooper, then of Motorola to his opposite number in Bell Labs who were also racing to be first. Bell Labs went on to install the first trial cellular network in Chicago in 1978. This trial system was licensed by the FCC to ATT for commercial use in 1982 and, as part of the divestiture arrangements for the breakup of ATT, the AMPS technology was distributed to local telcos. The first commercial system opened in Chicago in October 1983.Article by Larry Kahaner and Alan Green in the Chicago Tribune of December 22, 1983 Reach out and touch someone--by land, sea or air A system designed by Motorola also operated in the Washington D.C./Baltimore area from summer 1982 and became a full public service later the following year.Visited and evaluated by a group of (soon-to-be) British Telecoms staff (including writer) in September 1982. Japan's first commercial radiotelephony service was launched by NTT in 1979. The first fully automatic first generation cellular system was the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system, simultaneously launched in 1981 in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. NMT was the first mobile phone network featuring international roaming. The Swedish electrical engineer Östen Mäkitalo started to work on this vision in 1966, and is considered as the father of the NMT system and some also consider him the father of the cellular phone. There was a rapid growth of wireless telecommunications towards the end of the 20th century, primarily due to the introduction of digital signal processing in wireless communications, driven by the development of low-cost, very large- scale integration (VLSI) RF CMOS (radio-frequency complementary MOS) technology. The advent of cellular technology encouraged European countries to co-operate in the development of a pan-European cellular technology to rival those of the US and Japan. This resulted in the GSM system, the initials originally from the Groupe Spécial Mobile that was charged with the specification and development tasks but latterly as the 'Global System for Mobile Communications'. The GSM standard eventually spread outside Europe and is now the most widely used cellular technology in the world and the de facto standard. The industry association, the GSMA, now represents 219 countries and nearly 800 mobile network operators. There are now estimated to be over 5 billion phone subscriptions according to the \\"List of countries by number of mobile phones in use\\" (although some users have multiple subscriptions, or inactive subscriptions), which also makes the mobile phone the most widely spread technology and the most common electronic device in the world.global cellphone penetration reaches 50 percent The first mobile phone to enable internet connectivity and wireless email, the Nokia Communicator, was released in 1996, creating a new category of multi-use devices called smartphones. In 1999 the first mobile internet service was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan under the i-Mode service. By 2007 over 798 million people around the world accessed the internet or equivalent mobile internet services such as WAP and i-Mode at least occasionally using a mobile phone rather than a personal computer.  Cellular systems  Mobile phone subscriptions, not subscribers, per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007 Mobile phones receive and send radio signals with any number of cell site base stations fitted with microwave antennas. These sites are usually mounted on a tower, pole or building, located throughout populated areas, then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system. The phones have a low-power transceiver that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites, normally not more than 8 to 13 km (approximately 5 to 8 miles) away. In areas of low coverage, a cellular repeater may be used, which uses a long distance high-gain dish antenna or yagi antenna to communicate with a cell tower far outside of normal range, and a repeater to rebroadcast on a small short-range local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly. When the mobile phone or data device is turned on, it registers with the mobile telephone exchange, or switch, with its unique identifiers, and can then be alerted by the mobile switch when there is an incoming telephone call. The handset constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations, and is able to switch seamlessly between sites. As the user moves around the network, the \\"handoffs\\" are performed to allow the device to switch sites without interrupting the call. Cell sites have relatively low-power (often only one or two watts) radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch. The switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same wireless service provider or to the public telephone network, which includes the networks of other wireless carriers. Many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments, particularly in scenic areas. The dialogue between the handset and the cell site is a stream of digital data that includes digitised audio (except for the first generation analog networks). The technology that achieves this depends on the system which the mobile phone operator has adopted. The technologies are grouped by generation. The first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, are all analog and include AMPS and NMT. Second-generation systems, started in 1991 in Finland, are all digital and include GSM, CDMA and TDMA. The nature of cellular technology renders many phones vulnerable to 'cloning': anytime a cell phone moves out of coverage (for example, in a road tunnel), when the signal is re- established, the phone sends out a 're-connect' signal to the nearest cell- tower, identifying itself and signalling that it is again ready to transmit. With the proper equipment, it's possible to intercept the re-connect signal and encode the data it contains into a 'blank' phone—in all respects, the 'blank' is then an exact duplicate of the real phone and any calls made on the 'clone' will be charged to the original account. This problem was widespread with the first generation analogue technology, however the modern digital standards such as GSM greatly improve security and make cloning hard to achieve. In an effort to limit the potential harm from having a transmitter close to the user's body, the first fixed/mobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as car phones and bag phones) were limited to a maximum 3 watts Effective Radiated Power. Modern handheld cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.  Usage  = By civilians = This Railfone found on some Amtrak trains in North America uses cellular technology. An increasing number of countries, particularly in Europe, now have more mobile phones than people. According to the figures from Eurostat, the European Union's in-house statistical office, Luxembourg had the highest mobile phone penetration rate at 158 mobile subscriptions per 100 people, closely followed by Lithuania and Italy. In Hong Kong the penetration rate reached 139.8% of the population in July 2007.Office of the Telecommunications Authority in Hong Kong . Over 50 countries have mobile phone subscription penetration rates higher than that of the population and the Western European average penetration rate was 110% in 2007 (source Informa 2007). Canada currently has the lowest rates of mobile phone penetrations in the industrialised world at 58%. There are over five hundred million active mobile phone accounts in China, as of 2007, but the total penetration rate there still stands below 50%. The total number of mobile phone subscribers in the world was estimated at 2.14 billion in 2005. The subscriber count reached 2.7 billion by end of 2006 according to Information, and 3.3 billion by November, 2007, thus reaching an equivalent of over half the planet's population. Around 80% of the world's population has access to mobile phone coverage, as of 2006. This figure is expected to increase to 90% by the year 2010. In some developing countries with little \\"landline\\" telephone infrastructure, mobile phone use has quadrupled in the last decade. The rise of mobile phone technology in developing countries is often cited as an example of the leapfrog effect. Many remote regions in the third world went from having no telecommunications infrastructure to having satellite based communications systems. At present, Africa has the largest growth rate of cellular subscribers in the world, its markets expanding nearly twice as fast as Asian markets. The availability of prepaid or 'pay-as-you-go' services, where the subscriber is not committed to a long term contract, has helped fuel this growth in Africa as well as in other continents. On a numerical basis, India is the largest growth market, adding about 6 million mobile phones every month. It currently has a mobile subscriber base of 937.06 million mobile phones. = Traffic = Since the world is operating quickly to 3G and 4G networks, mobile traffic through video is heading high. It is expected that by end of 2018, the global traffic will reach an annual rate of 190 exabytes/year. This is the result of people shifting to smartphones. It is predicted by 2018, mobile traffic will reach by 10 billion connections with 94% traffic comes from Smartphones, laptops and tablets. Also 69% of mobile traffic from Videos since we have high definition screens available in smart phones and 176.9 wearable devices to be at use. Apparently, 4G will be dominating the traffic by 51% of total mobile data by 2018. = By government agencies =  Law enforcement  Law enforcement have used mobile phone evidence in a number of different ways. Evidence about the physical location of an individual at a given time can be obtained by triangulating the individual's cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual's cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over terrorism and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the British House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area. NIST have published guidelines and procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on mobile phones can be found under the NIST Publication SP800-101. , Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, May 2007. In the UK in 2000 it was claimed that recordings of mobile phone conversations made on the day of the Omagh bombing were crucial to the police investigation. In particular, calls made on two mobile phones which were tracked from south of the Irish border to Omagh and back on the day of the bombing, were considered of vital importance. Further example of criminal investigations using mobile phones is the initial location and ultimate identification of the terrorists of the 2004 Madrid train bombings. In the attacks, mobile phones had been used to detonate the bombs. However, one of the bombs failed to detonate, and the SIM card in the corresponding mobile phone gave the first serious lead about the terrorists to investigators. By tracking the whereabouts of the SIM card and correlating other mobile phones that had been registered in those areas, police were able to locate the terrorists.  Disaster response  The Finnish government decided in 2005 that the fastest way to warn citizens of disasters was the mobile phone network. In Japan, mobile phone companies provide immediate notification of earthquakes and other natural disasters to their customers free of charge. In the event of an emergency, disaster response crews can locate trapped or injured people using the signals from their mobile phones. An interactive menu accessible through the phone's Internet browser notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress. In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond cellular coverage, as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for free text messages when an AMBER Alert goes out for a missing person in their area. However, most mobile phone networks operate close to capacity during normal times, and spikes in call volumes caused by widespread emergencies often overload the system just when it is needed the most. Examples reported in the media where this has occurred include the September 11, 2001 attacks, the 2003 Northeast blackouts, the 2005 London Tube bombings, Hurricane Katrina, the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, and the 2007 Minnesota bridge collapse. Under FCC regulations, all mobile telephones must be capable of dialing emergency telephone numbers, regardless of the presence of a SIM card or the payment status of the account.  Impact on society  = Human health = Since the introduction of mobile phones, concerns (both scientific and public) have been raised about the potential health impacts from regular use. But by 2008, American mobile phones transmitted and received more text messages than phone calls. Numerous studies have reported no significant relationship between mobile phone use and health, but the effect of mobile phone usage on health continues to be an area of public concern. For example, at the request of some of their customers, Verizon created usage controls that meter service and can switch phones off, so that children could get some sleep. There have also been attempts to limit use by persons operating moving trains or automobiles, coaches when writing to potential players on their teams, and movie theater audiences. By one measure, nearly 40% of automobile drivers aged 16 to 30 years old text while driving, and by another, 40% of teenagers said they could text blindfolded. 18 studies have been conducted on the link between cell phones and brain cancer; A review of these studies found that cell phone use of 10 years or more \\"give a consistent pattern of an increased risk for acoustic neuroma and glioma\\".Hamilton, Tyler. \\"Listening to Cell Phone Warnings: Researchers Working Overtime to Find Out If the Greatest Tool of Business is Causing Brian Cancer in Those Who Use it Constantly\\" Toronto Star.

In July 2008, Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, warned about the radiation from mobile phones. He stated that there was no definitive proof of the link between mobile phones and brain tumors but there was enough studies that mobile phone usage should be reduced as a precaution. To reduce the amount of radiation being absorbed hands free devices can be used or texting could supplement calls. Calls could also be shortened or limit mobile phone usage in rural areas. Radiation is found to be higher in areas that are located away from mobile phone towers.Rachel Lieberman, Brandel France de Bravo, MPH, and Diana Zuckerman, Ph.D. \\"Can Cell Phones Harm Our Health? \\" National Research Center for Women and Families.

There is also a theory it could even occur on the fingers if someone spends a lot of time text messaging on metal menu buttons. In 2008, Lionel Bercovitch of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and his colleagues tested 22 popular handsets from eight different manufacturers and found nickel on 10 of the devices.Doctors warn of rash from mobile phone use Reuters.com. Retrieved October 17, 2008. = Human behaviour =  Culture and customs  Cellular phones allow people to communicate from almost anywhere at their leisure. Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the mobile phone has gone from being an expensive item used by the business elite to a pervasive, personal communications tool for the general population. In most countries, mobile phones outnumber land-line phones, with fixed landlines numbering 1.3 billion but mobile subscriptions 3.3 billion at the end of 2007. In many markets from Japan and South Korea, to Europe, to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, most children age 8-9 have mobile phones and the new accounts are now opened for customers aged 6 and 7. Where mostly parents tend to give hand-me- down used phones to their youngest children, in Japan already new cameraphones are on the market whose target age group is under 10 years of age, introduced by KDDI in February 2007. The USA also lags on this measure, as in the US so far, about half of all children have mobile phones. In many young adults' households it has supplanted the land-line phone. Mobile phone usage is banned in some countries, such as North Korea and restricted in some other countries such as Burma. Given the high levels of societal mobile phone service penetration, it is a key means for people to communicate with each other. The SMS feature spawned the \\"texting\\" sub-culture amongst younger users. In December 1993, the first person-to-person SMS text message was transmitted in Finland. Currently, texting is the most widely used data service; 1.8 billion users generated $80 billion of revenue in 2006 (source ITU). Many phones offer Instant Messenger services for simple, easy texting. Mobile phones have Internet service (e.g. NTT DoCoMo's i-mode), offering text messaging via e-mail in Japan, South Korea, China, and India. Most mobile internet access is much different from computer access, featuring alerts, weather data, e-mail, search engines, instant messages, and game and music downloading; most mobile internet access is hurried and short. Because mobile phones are often used publicly, social norms have been shown to play a major role in the usage of mobile phones. Furthermore, the mobile phone can be a fashion totem custom- decorated to reflect the owner's personality and may be a part of their self- identity. This aspect of the mobile telephony business is, in itself, an industry, e.g. ringtone sales amounted to $3.5 billion in 2005.Gundersen, Edna, \\"Mastertones ring up profits\\", USA Today, 11/29/2006 Mobile phone use on aircraft is starting to be allowed with several airlines already offering the ability to use phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics. The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.  Etiquette  Mobile phone use can be an important matter of social discourtesy: phones ringing during funerals or weddings; in toilets, cinemas and theatres. Some book shops, libraries, bathrooms, cinemas, doctors' offices and places of worship prohibit their use, so that other patrons will not be disturbed by conversations. Some facilities install signal-jamming equipment to prevent their use, although in many countries, including the US, such equipment is illegal. Many US cities with subway transit systems underground are studying or have implemented mobile phone reception in their tunnels for their riders, and trains, particularly those involving long-distance services, often offer a \\"quiet carriage\\" where phone use is prohibited, much like the designated non- smoking carriage of the past. Most schools in the United States and Europe and Canada have prohibited mobile phones in the classroom, or in school in an effort to limit class disruptions. A working group made up of Finnish telephone companies, public transport operators and communications authorities has launched a campaign to remind mobile phone users of courtesy, especially when using mass transit--what to talk about on the phone, and how to. In particular, the campaign wants to impact loud mobile phone usage as well as calls regarding sensitive matters.campaign to promote cell phone manners (in finish)  Use by drivers  The use of mobile phones by people who are driving has become increasingly common, for example as part of their job, as in the case of delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents. Studies have found vastly different relative risks (RR). Two separate studies using case-crossover analysis each calculated RR at 4, while an epidemiological cohort study found RR, when adjusted for crash-risk exposure, of 1.11 for men and 1.21 for women. A simulation study from the University of Utah Professor David Strayer compared drivers with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% to those conversing on a cell phone, and after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, the study concluded that cell phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers. Meta-analysis by The Canadian Automobile Association and The University of Illinois found that response time while using both hands- free and hand-held phones was approximately 0.5 standard deviations higher than normal driving (i.e., an average driver, while talking on a cell phone, has response times of a driver in roughly the 40th percentile). Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than driving while using a hand-held phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies. epidemiological studies, simulation studies, and meta-analysis. Even with this information, California initiated new Wireless Communications Device Law (effective January 1, 2009) makes it an infraction to write, send, or read text-based communication on an electronic wireless communications device, such as a cell phone, while driving a motor vehicle. Two additional laws dealing with the use of wireless telephones while driving went into effect July 1, 2008. The first law prohibits all drivers from using a handheld wireless telephone while operating a motor vehicle. The law allows a driver to use a wireless telephone to make emergency calls to a law enforcement agency, a medical provider, the fire department, or other emergency services agency. The base fine for the FIRST offense is $20 and $50 for subsequent convictions. With penalty assessments, the fine can be more than triple the base fine amount. videos about California cellular phone laws; with captions (California Vehicle Code [VC] §23123). Motorists 18 and over may use a “hands-free device. The second law effective July 1, 2008, prohibits drivers under the age of 18 from using a wireless telephone or hands-free device while operating a motor vehicle (VC §23124)The consistency of increased crash risk between hands-free and hand-held phone use is at odds with legislation in over 30 countries that prohibit hand-held phone use but allow hands-free. Scientific literature is mixed on the dangers of talking on a phone versus those of talking with a passenger, with the Accident Research Unit at the University of Nottingham finding that the number of utterances was usually higher for mobile calls when compared to blindfolded and non-blindfolded passengers, but the University of Illinois meta-analysis concluding that passenger conversations were just as costly to driving performance as cell phone ones.  Use on aircraft  As of 2007, several airlines are experimenting with base station and antenna systems installed on the airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing. Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration in the autumn of 2007. Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane. On March 20, 2008, an Emirates flight was the first time voice calls have been allowed in-flight on commercial airline flights. The breakthrough came after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the United Arab Emirates-based General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) granted full approval for the AeroMobile system to be used on Emirates. Passengers were able to make and receive voice calls as well as use text messaging. The system automatically came into operation as the Airbus A340-300 reached cruise altitude. Passengers wanting to use the service received a text message welcoming them to the AeroMobile system when they first switched their phones on. The approval by EASA has established that GSM phones are safe to use on airplanes, as the AeroMobile system does not require the modification of aircraft components deemed \\"sensitive,\\" nor does it require the use of modified phones. In any case, there are inconsistencies between practices allowed by different airlines and even on the same airline in different countries. For example, Delta Air Lines may allow the use of mobile phones immediately after landing on a domestic flight within the US, whereas they may state \\"not until the doors are open\\" on an international flight arriving in the Netherlands. In April 2007 the US Federal Communications Commission officially prohibited passengers' use of cell phones during a flight. In a similar vein, signs are put up in many countries, such as Canada, the UK and the U.S., at petrol stations prohibiting the use of mobile phones, due to possible safety issues. However, it is unlikely that mobile phone use can cause any problems, Mobile Phones and Service Stations: Rumour, Risk and Precaution, by Adam Burgess (2007) Diogenes 213 54: 1 and in fact \\"petrol station employees have themselves spread the rumour about alleged incidents.\\" = Environmental impacts = Cellular antenna disguised to look like a tree Like all high structures, cellular antenna masts pose a hazard to low flying aircraft. Towers over a certain height or towers that are close to airports or heliports are normally required to have warning lights. There have been reports that warning lights on cellular masts, TV-towers and other high structures can attract and confuse birds. US authorities estimate that millions of birds are killed near communication towers in the country each year. Some cellular antenna towers have been camouflaged to make them less obvious on the horizon, and make them look more like a tree. An example of the way mobile phones and mobile networks have sometimes been perceived as a threat is the widely reported and later discredited claim that mobile phone masts are associated with the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) which has reduced bee hive numbers by up to 75% in many areas, especially near cities in the US. The Independent newspaper cited a scientific study claiming it provided evidence for the theory that mobile phone masts are a major cause in the collapse of bee populations, with controlled experiments demonstrating a rapid and catastrophic effect on individual hives near masts. Mobile phones were in fact not covered in the study, and the original researchers have since emphatically disavowed any connection between their research, mobile phones, and CCD, specifically indicating that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created \\"a horror story\\". While the initial claim of damage to bees was widely reported, the corrections to the story were almost non- existent in the media. There are more than 500 million used mobile phones in the US sitting on shelves or in landfills, and it is estimated that over 125 million will be discarded this year alone. The problem is growing at a rate of more than two million phones per week, putting tons of toxic waste into landfills daily. Several companies offer to buy back and recycle mobile phones from users. In the United States many unwanted but working mobile phones are donated to women's shelters to allow emergency communication.  Tariff models  Mobile phone shop in Uganda = Payment methods = There are two principal ways to pay for mobile telephony: the 'pay-as-you-go' model where conversation time is purchased and added to a phone unit via an Internet account or in shops or ATMs, or the contract model where bills are paid by regular intervals after the service has been consumed. It is increasingly common for a consumer to purchase a basic package and then bolt-on services and functionality to create a subscription customised to the users needs. Pay as you go (also known as \\"pre-pay\\" or \\"prepaid\\") accounts were invented simultaneously in Portugal and Italy and today form more than half of all mobile phone subscriptions. USA, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, Israel and Finland are among the rare countries left where most phones are still contract-based. = Incoming call charges = In the early days of mobile telephony, the operators (carriers) charged for all air time consumed by the mobile phone user, which included both outbound and inbound telephone calls. As mobile phone adoption rates increased, competition between operators meant that some decided not to charge for incoming calls in some markets (also called \\"calling party pays\\"). The European market adopted a calling party pays model throughout the GSM environment and soon various other GSM markets also started to emulate this model. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, and the United States, it is common for the party receiving the call to be charged per minute, although a few carriers are beginning to offer unlimited received phone calls. This is called the \\"Receiving Party Pays\\" model. In China, it was reported that both of its two operators will adopt the caller-pays approach as early as January 2007.Amy Gu, \\"Mainland mobile services to be cheaper\\", South China Morning Post, December 18, 2006, Page A1. One disadvantage of the receiving party pays systems is that phone owners keep their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, which results in the total voice usage rates (and profits) in Calling Party Pays countries outperform those in Receiving Party Pays countries.OECD.org To avoid the problem of users keeping their phone turned off, most Receiving Party Pays countries have either switched to Calling Party Pays, or their carriers offer additional incentives such as a large number of monthly minutes at a sufficiently discounted rate to compensate for the inconvenience. Note that when a user roaming in another country, international roaming tariffs apply to all calls received, regardless of the model adopted in the home country.REGULATORY AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT Technologies used The list below is a non-comprehensive attempt at listing the technologies used in mobile telephony: 0G (mobile radio telephone) 1G networks (analog networks) 2G networks (the first digital networks): *GSM *Digital AMPS *cdmaOne **GPRS **EDGE(IMT-SC) **Evolved EDGE 3G networks: *UMTS **W-CDMA (air interface) **TD-CDMA (air interface) **TD-SCDMA (air interface) ***HSPA ***HSDPA ***HSPA+ *CDMA2000 **OFDMA (air interface) ***EVDO ****SVDO 4G networks: *LTE (TD-LTE) *LTE Advanced *LTE Advanced Pro *WiMAX *WiMAX-Advanced (WirelessMAN-Advanced) *Ultra Mobile Broadband (never commercialized) 5G networks: *5G NR Starting with EVDO the following techniques can also be used to improve performance: *MIMO, SDMA and Beamforming  See also  * Cellular network * Mobile Internet * Mobile phone * OpenBTS  References  Further reading * Chen, Adrian, \\"The Confidence Game: How Silicon Valley broke the economy\\", The Nation, vol. 309, no. 11 (4 November 2019), pp. 27–30.

Begun in 1898, it was one of the most popular venues in the United States for the first seven decades of the twentieth century, featuring concerts, exhibits, and an amusement park. It billed itself as the Showplace of the Nation and at its peak measured . The pier is owned by the Catanoso Family and operates under the Steel Pier Associates, LLC name. The Catanosos had previously leased the pier to operate the amusement park before they purchased it. The Steel Pier continues to operate as an amusement pier and is one of the most successful family-oriented attractions in the city. History Steel Pier in 2012 Steel Pier Ferris wheel in Atlantic City with Trump Taj Mahal in background in 2009. The pier was built by the Steel Pier Company and opened on June 18, 1898. It was built on iron pilings, using a concrete understructure with steel girders. In 1904, a storm washed away part of Steel Pier, and many engineers stated that it could not be rebuilt. Atlantic City's future mayor, Edward L. Bader, and his company accepted the challenge to rebuild it. His success with that job led to more work for him in Atlantic City. In 1924, a fire caused significant damage to the pier. Frank Gravatt purchased the pier the following year and renovated it. He was called the \\"salt water Barnum\\" by the local newspaper. The restored pier hosted dance bands, three movie theaters, exhibits, operas, children's shows, a water circus, stunts, and other attractions. Gravatt signed John Philip Sousa for a series of annual concerts. The General Motors Exhibit opened in 1926 and continued through 1933, when it was replaced by Ford. (General Motors returned in 1947 and continued until 1968.) From 1935 through 1938, the Steel Pier was where Miss America was crowned. It was described as \\"An Amusement City at Sea\\" and \\"A Vacation in Itself.\\" It also was once called the \\"Showplace of the Nation\\" and included such acts as the High Diving horse; Rex the Wonder Dog, a water-skiing canine in the 1930s; the diving bell; and musicians, including Frank Sinatra and Al Jolson, among others. Diana Ross and The Supremes played week-long engagements during the summer in 1965, 1966, and 1967, to sold-out business in the Steel Pier's Music Hall Theater and the Marine Ballroom. \\"Rain or Shine ... There's Always a Good Show on Steel Pier\\" was another phrase used to describe the venue's varied entertainment. In 1945, the pier was purchased by George Hamid, who operated the competing Million Dollar Pier. He brought popular and rock and roll music to the pier, starting with Bill Haley and the Comets in 1955. Parts of the pier were damaged or lost during the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. The Beatles were booked in 1964, but overwhelming demand for tickets forced them to move to Boardwalk Hall. The pier used to be much longer, but a December 1969 fire six months before the opening of the 1970 season shortened its size by about a third. By the end of the 1960s, the pier was feeling the effects of declining tourism in Atlantic City. The pier was sold to a group of local businessmen in 1973. After gambling was legalized, a developer proposed turning the pier into a hotel- casino. However, the necessary governmental approvals could not be obtained, and the pier was sold to Resorts International in 1978, which mainly used the pier for storage. The original wooden pier with steel underpinnings was destroyed in a 1982 fire; the current concrete structure dates from 1993. Trump Entertainment acquired ownership of the pier when it acquired the Trump Taj Mahal in the late 1980s. The Trump Steel Pier opened in 1992, but had been reduced to about and featured mainly amusement rides. The Steel Pier continues to operate as an amusement park to this day. In June 2008, the Steel Pier celebrated its 110th anniversary, having originally opened on Saturday, June 18, 1898. In February 2012, it was announced that a diving horse act would return to the Steel Pier as part of the recently approved Tourism Master Plan, but the plan was soon scrapped after public outcry. In 2017, a newer and bigger giant Ferris wheel was added to the pier.

The Braves entered the playoffs for the seventh straight season with a franchise-record 106 regular season wins, an offense that hit 215 home runs, and a pitching staff made up of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Denny Neagle, and Kevin Millwood to the playoffs. The lowest win total for any of these five pitchers was Neagle at 16-11, with the other four winning 17, 17, 18, and 20 respectively. However, they also carried the baggage of their embarrassing NLCS loss to the Florida Marlins the previous season. In the NLDS, the Braves swept Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs. After a 76–86 season in 1997, San Diego stormed out and took control of their division, finishing with a 98–64 record, their best in team history. The offense was led by the 50 home run club's newest member, Greg Vaughn, and by Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn. The San Diego rotation was anchored by 18-game winner Kevin Brown, who helped Florida defeat Atlanta in the 1997 NLCS, along with All-Star Andy Ashby and the series MVP Sterling Hitchcock. Closer Trevor Hoffman saved an astounding 53 games in the regular season. The Padres defeated the favored Houston Astros in four games in the NLDS. It was the seventh-consecutive NLCS appearance for the Braves and they would be heavily favored against the Padres, though their edge in the season series between the two teams was modest, having won 5 of 9. The Padres would go on to the lose in a sweep to the New York Yankees in the World Series in four games. Summary =Atlanta Braves vs. San Diego Padres= Game summaries =Game 1= Wednesday, October 7, 1998, at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia With John Smoltz on the mound, the Braves struck first when Andruw Jones hit a home run to lead off the third inning off Andy Ashby. The Padres tied the game in the fifth when Tony Gwynn, appearing in his first NLCS since 1984, hit an RBI single with two on. Ruben Rivera doubled to lead off the eighth, then an error by first baseman Andrés Galarraga on Jim Leyritz's ground ball off of Dennis Martinez helped San Diego take a 2–1 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, closer Trevor Hoffman came into the game early to end a Braves' scoring threat. However, in the ninth, the Braves got the tying run off him when Ryan Klesko, walked, moved to third on a single and scored on a sacrifice fly by Jones. In the tenth, Ken Caminiti belted a home run off reliever Kerry Ligtenberg to give San Diego their winning margin. The Braves put two men on via walks in the bottom of the inning, but Galarraga flew out to end the game. =Game 2= Thursday, October 8, 1998, at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia After the tightly-contested Game 1, Kevin Brown, who was developing a reputation as a \\"Brave killer\\" pitched a three-hit shutout with 11 strikeouts. Tom Glavine matched Brown until the sixth, when San Diego hit three straight two-out singles, the last of which by Quilvio Veras brought in a run. San Diego added two insurance runs in the ninth off of Odalis Perez. Back-to-back leadoff singles and an error by catcher Javy Lopez put runners on first and third. Steve Finley's RBI single scored a run. Then one out later with the bases loaded, Wally Joyner's RBI single scored another before Brown pitched a perfect ninth and put the Braves down two games to none. =Game 3= Saturday, October 10, 1998, at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California The Braves offense was held quiet again as San Diego won Game 3 and took a commanding 3–0 series lead. This was the only game won by the home team. Atlanta sent Greg Maddux to the hill and the Braves struck first in the third when Tony Graffanino drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on Maddux's sacrifice bunt and scored on Walt Weiss's single, but in the fifth, Sterling Hitchcock singled with one out, then one out later, scored on Steve Finley's double to tie the game. After an intentional walk, Ken Caminiti's RBI single put the Padres up 2–1. The Braves loaded the bases in the sixth with one out, but Donne Wall struck out Michael Tucker and Greg Colbrunn to end the threat. The Braves also loaded the bases in the eighth with one out, but again failed to score. In the bottom of the inning, Wally Joyner walked with two outs off of Rudy Seanez, then scored on Carlos Hernández's double. Hernandez advanced to third on an error and scored on passed ball that padded the Padres' lead to 4–1. Trevor Hoffman struck out the side in the ninth and San Diego took Game 3 by a score of 4–1. Starter Sterling Hitchcock got the win with five innings pitched and one run allowed. Atlanta now appeared to be in an insurmountable hole—no team had ever come back from a three games to none deficit in baseball history. This was the last home postseason victory for the Padres until Game 2 of the 2020 National League Wild Card Series. =Game 4= Sunday, October 11, 1998, at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California San Diego was looking for a sweep and took the first step by taking a 2–0 lead in the third. Quilvio Veras walked with one out off of Denny Neagle, then scored on Tony Gwynn's double. After a single, Gwynn scored on Jim Leyritz's single. The Braves cut the lead to 2–1 when Keith Lockhart hit a leadoff triple and scored on Chipper Jones's single, then tied it in sixth on when Jones doubled with two outs and after a walk, scored on a Ryan Klesko RBI single, but San Diego retook the lead in the bottom of the inning when Jim Leyritz, two years removed from his crucial home run against the Braves in the 1996 World Series, hit a shot off Neagle. The Braves would refuse to go quietly, exploding for six runs in the seventh inning. Javy López led off with a home run, followed by an Andruw Jones single that ended the night for Padres starter Joey Hamilton. Jones moved to second on Randy Myers's wild pitch, then to third on a groundout before scoring on Ozzie Guillén's single to put the Braves up 4–3. A single and walk loaded the bases Dan Miceli relieved Myers and Andrés Galarraga launched a prodigious grand slam that left Atlanta ahead 8–3. The Braves, who used six pitchers in the win, avoided the sweep. They also became the first team since the 1970 Cincinnati Reds to win a post-season game after being down 3 games to none in the series, and the first to do it in a League Championship Series. It had been done three previous times in a World Series (1910, 1937, and 1970), and all of those teams had subsequently lost Game 5. =Game 5= Monday, October 12, 1998, at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California After Atlanta's offensive outburst in Game 4 to stay alive, the Padres hoped to close out the Braves in front of their home fans in Game 5. They sent Andy Ashby to the hill against Atlanta starter John Smoltz. Ken Caminiti got things started with a two-run homer off Smoltz to give San Diego a first inning lead. Three consecutive one-out singles in the fourth cut the lead to 2–1. Andruw Jones, who was caught stealing home in the fourth, stole second base in the fifth after singling with two outs, allowing himself to score on a Michael Tucker single to tie the game 2–2. However, John Vander Wal, who had five home runs all year, hit a two-run home run off Smoltz in the bottom of the inning after a two-out single that put San Diego back on top 4–2. After a single by Ozzie Guillén to start the seventh, manager Bruce Bochy brought starter Kevin Brown into the game. Brown retired the first three Braves he faced. The Padres threatened in the bottom of the seventh, but John Rocker came in for Smoltz and retired Tony Gwynn. Still holding a 4–2 lead, Brown was set to pitch the eighth for San Diego. He allowed the first two batters to reach but got Andruw Jones to pop out, bringing the Padres five outs away from a championship. Then Michael Tucker got a hold of a Brown fastball and launched a flyball to deep right center field that left the park and put Atlanta ahead 5–4. Bochy got Brown out of the game, replacing him with Donne Wall, who walked Rocker, then one out later, Tony Graffanino doubled, scoring another run, then crossed home himself when Chris Gomez committed a throwing error on the relay. Behind 7–4 and stunned, the Padres attempted to rally in the ninth. Greg Myers belted a pinch-hit two-run homer with no one out off of Kerry Ligtenberg to make it 7–6, prompting Bobby Cox to bring in Greg Maddux in relief. Maddux retired the side, with nemesis Tony Gwynn grounding out to finish the game, and earned his first ever career save. The save would be the only save in Maddux's career. This wild game cut San Diego's series lead to one game, and with the series returning to Atlanta with Tom Glavine set to pitch, many believed that the Braves had a serious chance of coming back. This Braves win marked the first time in baseball history that a team had come back from a three games to none (in a best of seven series) deficit to reach a Game 6. =Game 6= Wednesday, October 14, 1998, at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia After Kevin Brown's disastrous outing in Game 5, he was unable to come back for Game 6, forcing the Padres to instead start Sterling Hitchcock. The Braves had become the first team to force a Game 6 after dropping the first three games, and now had only to do what had been done many times before--win the final two at home. They had the right pitchers to accomplish this, giving themselves the best shot any team could have, but Hitchcock pitched five scoreless innings with eight strikeouts. Glavine looked good as well, matching Hitchcock zero for zero through that point, but ran into trouble in the sixth (the same inning that had doomed him in Game 6 exactly a year to the day prior against the Florida Marlins). After back-to-back one-out singles put runners on first and third, Jim Leyritz had an RBI groundout that scored the first run before Wally Joyner added a single that made it 2–0. A single and walk loaded the bases before Sterling Hitchcock reached on a costly error by left fielder Danny Bautista that scored two more runs. Glavine left the game and John Rocker promptly gave up an RBI single to Quilvio Veras. The unearned runs made it 5–0 and the San Diego bullpen would pitch a hitless final four innings. The Braves only managed two hits the entire game. Hitchcock, who won two games, was named the series MVP. It was their first pennant since 1984. To date, this is the Padres' most recent pennant.

It also prevents the jaws coming together fully, thereby reducing the risk of jaw joint injuries and concussion.\\" A mouthguard is most often used to prevent injury in contact sports, as a treatment for bruxism or TMD, or as part of certain dental procedures, such as tooth bleaching or sleep apnea treatment. Depending on application, it may also be called a mouth protector, mouth piece, gumshield, gumguard, nightguard, occlusal splint, bite splint, or bite plane. The dentists who specialise in Sports Dentistry fabricate mouthguards, and these specialists are called Sports Dentists or Team Dentists. Types =Stock or ready made= Manufactured in a pre-formed shape in various sizes but with nearly no adjustment to fit the user's mouth. The only adjustment possible is minor trimming with a knife or scissors. =Mouth adapted or \\"boil and bite\\"= A thermoplastic material manufactured in a pre-formed shape in various sizes that can be adapted to fit more closely to an individual's teeth and gums by heating and molding such as boiling then placing in the mouth. Some are now available that incorporate special fins within the fitting zones which increase retention and give an improved fit over traditional boil and bite mouth types. Guards are usually made of Ethylene-vinyl acetate, commonly known as EVA. Some of the newer technologies offer an alternative, stronger thermo-polymer that allows for lower molding temperatures, below 140F to prevent burning by scalding hot water. This is the most popular mouthguard used by amateur and semi-professional sportsmen, providing adequate protection but relatively low comfort in comparison to the custom-made guard. =Custom- made= Vacuum form mouthguard made from an impression using dental alginate. An impression of the user's teeth is used by specialist manufacturers to create a best-fit mouth protector. The impression may be obtained by using a specially designed impression kit that uses dental putty, or from a dentist who will take an impression in dental alginate material. One company(GuardLab) is using 3D imaging to create a digital impression. The resulting impression is sent to a lab that makes a guard from the impression. In the EU, the guard must be sold with a CE mark and the guard must have passed an EC Type- Examination test, performed by an accredited European Notified Body. Applying a CE mark without such certification is a criminal offense. *Vacuum Form **Custom-made mouth guards using this type of machine produce single layer mouth guards **Fit not as good as pressure laminated but offers more protection than boil and bite *Pressure Laminated **Custom-made mouth guards using this type of machine produce multi-layer mouth guards **Offers superior fit, comfort and more protection *Impressionless **Made from a medical-grade thermo polymer, the guards are activated with hot (not boiling water) and create a custom comfort fit, completely unique to the shape of the mouth. **1.6 mm thin, Remoldable, Works with braces, Stays secure in mouth during the entire game or practice **Allows athletes to talk, breathe and drink naturally =Dentistry= Occlusal splint Occlusal splints (also called bite splints, bite planes, or night guards) are removable dental appliances carefully molded to fit the upper or lower arches of teeth. They are used to protect tooth and restoration surfaces, manage mandibular (jaw) dysfunction TMD, and stabilize the jaw joints during occlusion or create space prior to restoration procedures. People prone to nocturnal bruxism, or nighttime clenching, as well as morsicatio buccarum may routinely wear occlusal splints at night. However, a meta-analysis of occlusal splints used for this purpose concluded \\"There is not enough evidence to state that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism. An indication of its use is questionable concerning sleep outcomes, but there may be some benefit with regard to tooth wear.\\" Occlusal splints are typically made of a heat-cured acrylic resin. Soft acrylic or light cured composite, or vinyl splints may be made more quickly and cheaply, but are not as durable, and are more commonly made for short-term use. Soft splints are also used for children because normal growth changes the fit of hard splints. They cover all the teeth of the upper or lower arch, but partial coverage is sometimes used. Occlusal splints are usually used on either the upper or the lower teeth, termed maxillary splints or mandibular splints respectively, but sometimes both types are used at the same time. Maxillary splints are more common, although various situations favor mandibular splints. Stabilizing or Michigan-type occlusal splints are generally flat against the opposing teeth, and help jaw muscle relaxation, while repositioning occlusal splints are used to reposition the jaw to improve occlusion. Usage *Dental trauma **Mouthguards are used in sports where deliberate or accidental impacts to the face and jaw may cause harm. Such impacts may occur in many sports including baseball, boxing, mixed martial arts, puroresu, rugby, wrestling, football (soccer), gridiron football, Gaelic football, Australian football, lacrosse, basketball, figure skating, ice hockey, underwater hockey, field hockey, water polo, skiing, and snowboarding. Mouthguards may also prevent or reduce harm levels of concussion in the event of an injury to the jaw.NZ Dental Association advice \\"Do mouthguards prevent concussion?\\" In many sports, the rules of the sport make their use compulsory,\\"...mouthguards became compulsory in 1997...\\" or local health laws demand them. Schools also often have rules requiring their use.\\"...mouthguards will be mandatory for all basketball and wrestling teams in the middle and upper schools....\\" Studies in various high risk populations for dental injuries are repeatedly reporting of a low compliance of individuals for the regular using of mouthguard during activities. Moreover, even with regular use, effectiveness in prevention on dental trauma is not complete, and injuries can still occur even when mouthguards are used as users are not always aware of the best makes or size, which inevitably result in a poor fit. *Oral medicine **Mouthguards may be used as splints to reduce strain over the temporomandibular joint in temporomandibular joint disorderTeeth grinding. Bruxism. https://www.nhs.uk/ **To prevent tooth attrition in bruxism **To deliver topical medication (e.g., corticosteroids) for chronic gingival diseases such as mucous membrane pemphigoid. **As a therapeutic device in the treatment of morsicatio buccarum. *Dental aesthetics **During tooth bleaching **As a night protector of thin porcelain bridges *Orthodontics **Transparent or clear aligner, which is basically an acrylic thermoplastic splints, used to correct a series of different malocclusions. Not all malocclusions can be corrected with transparent aligners, only mild and moderate malocclusions. They can be used alone or in combination with brackets.Various scientific articles on NCBI on the use of transparent aligners There are many brands, like Essix (used as a retainer),What is an Essix Retainer? InvisalignInvisalign web site or CA Clear Aligner.CA CLEAR ALIGNER site **Two types of mouthguards, the mandibular advancement device (MAD) and the tongue stabilizing device (TSD), are used for treating sleep apnea and snoring History The exact origins of the mouthguard are unclear. Most evidence indicates that the concept of a mouthguard was initiated in the sport of boxing. Originally, boxers fashioned rudimentary mouthguards out of cotton, tape, sponge, or small pieces of wood. Boxers clenched the material between their teeth. These boxers had a hard time focusing on the fight and clenching their teeth at the same time. Since these devices proved impractical, Woolf Krause, a British dentist, began to fashion mouthpieces for boxers in 1892. Krause placed strips of a natural rubber resin, gutta-percha, over the maxillary incisors of boxers before they entered the ring. Phillip Krause, Woolf Krause’s son, is often credited with the first reusable mouthpiece. Phillip Krause’s invention was highlighted in a 1921 championship fight between Jack Britton and Ted \\"Kid\\" Lewis. Lewis was a school friend of Krause and the first professional to utilize the new technology, then called a ‘gum shield.’ During the fight, Britton’s manager successfully argued that the mouthpiece was an illegal advantage. Philip Krause was an amateur boxer himself and undoubtedly used his device before 1921.Knapik et al., 2007, p. 120. There have been other claims to the invention of the mouthguard as well. In the early 1900s, Jacob Marks created a custom-fitted mouthguard in London.Pontsa, Peter T. (2008). Mouth Guards Prevent Dental Trauma in Sports. The Dent-Liner 12 (3). An American dentist, Thomas A. Carlos, also developed a mouth guard at approximately the same time as Krause. Carlos claimed that he made his first mouthpiece in 1916 and later suggested his invention to the United States Olympian Dinnie O’Keefe in 1919. Another dentist from Chicago, E. Allen Franke, also claimed to have made many mouth guards for boxers by 1919. The mouthguard’s relevance was again brought to the center of attention in a 1927 boxing match between Jack Sharkey and Mike McTigue. McTigue was winning for most of the fight, but a chipped tooth cut his lip, and he was forced to forfeit the match. From that point on, mouthguards were ruled acceptable and soon became commonplace for all boxers.Knapik et al., 2007, p. 121. In 1930, descriptions of mouthguards first appeared in dental literature. Dr. Clearance Mayer, a dentist and boxing inspector for the New York State Athletic Commission, described how custom mouthguards could be manufactured from impressions using wax and rubber. Steel springs were even recommended to reinforce soft materials. In 1947, a Los Angeles dentist, Rodney O. Lilyquist, made a breakthrough by using transparent acrylic resin to form what he termed an \\"acrylic splint\\". Molded to fit unobtrusively over the upper or lower teeth, the acrylic mouthguard was a distinct improvement over the thick mouthguard worn by boxers. It meant that the athlete could talk in a normal manner while the mouthguard was in place. In the January 1948 issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association, the procedure for making and fitting the acrylic mouthguard was described in detail by Dr. Lilyquist. He immediately received nationwide recognition as the father of the modern mouthguard for athletes.\\"Protecting Athletes' Teeth.\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 21.162 (Feb. 6, 1948) 18. The first athlete to wear the acrylic mouthguard was a member of the UCLA basketball team, Dick Perry, who modeled the device at a convention of the Southern California Dental Association. Another early wearer was Frankie Albert, quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. American Football mouthguard In the 1940s and 1950s, dental injuries were responsible for 24-50% of all injuries in American football. In 1952, Life magazine did a report on Notre Dame football players without incisors.The fighting Irish look tough again. Life Magazine 1952; 33: 60-63. The article drew a lot of public attention and led to the inclusion of mouthguards in other contact sports. In the 1950s, the American Dental Association (ADA) began researching mouthguards and soon promoted their benefits to the public. In 1960, the ADA recommended the use of latex mouthguards in all contact sports. By 1962, all high school football players in the United States were required to wear mouthguards. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) followed suit in 1973 and made mouthguards mandatory in college football. Since the introduction of the mouthguard, the number of dental injuries has decreased dramatically.Knapik, et al., 2007, p. 121. Mouthguards have become a standard in many sports. In addition to football, the NCAA currently requires mouthguards in ice hockey, field hockey, and lacrosse. The ADA shows that mouthguards are extremely effective in preventing facial injury in contact and non-contact sports. The ADA recommends mouthguards be used in 29 sports: acrobatics, basketball, bicycling, boxing, equestrian, football, gymnastics, handball, ice hockey, inline skating, lacrosse, martial arts, racquetball, rugby football, shot putting, skateboarding, skiing, skydiving, soccer, softball, squash, surfing, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting and wrestling.

Before and after tooth whitening. Tooth whitening or tooth bleaching is the process of lightning the color of human teeth. Whitening is often desirable when teeth become yellowed over time for a number of reasons, and can be achieved by changing the intrinsic or extrinsic color of the tooth enamel. The chemical degradation of the chromogens within or on the tooth is termed as bleaching. Hydrogen peroxide () is the active ingredient most commonly used in whitening products and is delivered as either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is analogous to carbamide peroxide as it is released when the stable complex is in contact with water. When it diffuses into the tooth, hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidising agent that breaks down to produce unstable free radicals. In the spaces between the inorganic salts in tooth enamel, these unstable free radicals attach to organic pigment molecules resulting in small, less heavily pigmented components. Reflecting less light, these smaller molecules create a \\"whitening effect\\". There are different products available on the market to remove stains. For whitening treatment to be successful, dental professionals should correctly diagnose the type, intensity and location of the tooth discolouration. Time exposure and the concentration of the bleaching compound, determines the tooth whitening endpoint. Natural shade The perception of tooth colour is multi-factorial. Reflection and absorption of light by the tooth can be influenced by a number of factors including specular transmission of light through the tooth; specular reflection at the surface; diffuse light reflection at the surface; absorption and scattering of light within the dental tissues; enamel mineral content; enamel thickness; dentine colour, the human observer, the fatigue of the eye, the type of incident light, and the presence of extrinsic and intrinsic stains. Additionally, the perceived brightness of the tooth can change depending on the brightness and colour of the background. The combination of intrinsic colour and the presence of extrinsic stains on the tooth surface influence the colour and thus the overall appearance of teeth. The scattering of light and absorption within enamel and dentine determine the intrinsic colour of teeth and because the enamel is relatively translucent, the dentinal properties can play a major role in determining the overall tooth colour. On the other hand, extrinsic stain and colour is the result of coloured regions that have formed within the acquired pellicle on the enamel surface and can be influenced by lifestyle behaviours or habits. For example, dietary intake of tannin-rich foods, poor tooth brushing technique, tobacco products, and exposure to iron salts and chlorhexidine can darken the colour of a tooth. With increasing age, teeth tend to be darker in shade. This can be attributed to secondary dentin formation and thinning of enamel due to tooth wear which contributes to a significant decrease in lightness and increase in yellowness. Tooth shade is not influenced by gender or race. Staining and discolouration Tooth discolouration and staining is primarily due to two sources of stain: intrinsic and extrinsic (see Figure 2). In essence, tooth whitening primarily targets those intrinsic stains in which cannot be removed through mechanics such as a debridement (clean) or prophylaxis, in the dental office. Below explains in-depth the differences between the two sources of which contribute to such discolouration of the tooth's surface. Figure 2. Examples of tooth staining. Extrinsic staining examples: A. Smoking; B. Wine stain; and C. Food stain. Intrinsic staining examples: D. Age yellowing; E. Decay; F. Orthodontic white spot lesion; G. Mild fluorosis; H. Amalgam restoration; I. Tetracycline stain; J. Genetic (amelogenesis imperfecta); K. and non-vital colouring. =Extrinsic staining= Extrinsic staining, is largely due to environmental factors including smoking, pigments in beverages and foods, antibiotics, and metals such as iron or copper. Coloured compounds from these sources are adsorbed into acquired dental pellicle or directly onto the surface of the tooth causing a stain to appear. * Dental plaque: Dental plaque is a clear biofilm of bacteria that naturally forms in the mouth, particularly along the gumline, and it occurs due to the normal development and defences of the immune system. Although usually virtually invisible on the tooth surface, plaque may become stained by chromogenic bacteria such as Actinomyces species. Prolonged dental plaque accumulation on the tooth surface can lead to enamel demineralisation and formation of white spot lesions which appear as an opaque milk-coloured lesion. The acidic by-products of fermentable carbohydrates derived from high-sugar foods contribute to greater proportions of bacteria, such as Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus in dental plaque. Higher consumption of fermentable carbohydrates will promote demineralisation and increase the risk of developing white spot lesions. * Calculus: neglected plaque will eventually calcify, and lead to the formation of a hard deposit on the teeth, especially around the gumline. The organic matrix of dental plaque and calcified tissues undergo a series of chemical and morphological changes that lead to calcification of the dental plaque and therefore leading to the formation of calculus. The color of calculus varies, and may be grey, yellow, black, or brown. The colour of calculus depends on how long it has been present in the oral cavity for; it typically starts off yellow and over time the calculus will begin to stain a darker colour and become more tenacious and difficult to remove. * Tobacco: tar in the smoke from tobacco products (and also smokeless tobacco products) tends to form a yellow-brown-black stain around the necks of the teeth above the gumline. The nicotine and tar in tobacco, combined with oxygen, turns yellow and over time will absorb into the pores of enamel and stain the teeth yellow. The dark brown to black stains along the gum line of the teeth are the result of the porous nature of calculus immediately picking up the stains from nicotine and tar. * Betel chewing. Betel chewing produces blood-red saliva that stains the teeth red- brown to nearly black. The extract gel of betel leaf contain tannin, a chromogenic agent that causes discolouration of the tooth enamel. * Tannin is also present in coffee, tea, and red wine and produces a chromogenic agent that can discolor teeth. Large consumptions of tannin-containing beverages stain the dental enamel brown due to the chromogenic nature. * Certain foods, including curries and tomato-based sauces, can cause teeth staining. * Certain topical medications: Chlorhexidine (antiseptic mouthwash) binds to tannins, meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee, tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining (i.e. removable staining) of teeth. Chlorhexidine mouthwash has a natural liking for sulphate and acidic groups commonly found in areas where plaque accumulates such as along the gumline, on the dorsum of the tongue and cavities. Chlorhexidine is retained in these areas and stain yellow-brown. The stains are not permanent and can be removed with proper brushing. * Metallic compounds. Exposure to such metallic compounds may be in the form of medication or occupational exposure. Examples include iron (black stain), iodine (black), copper (green), nickel (green), and cadmium (yellow-brown). Sources of exposure to metal include placing metal into the oral cavity, metal-containing dust inhalation, or oral administration of drugs. Metals can enter the bony structure of the tooth, causing permanent discolouration, or can bind to the pellicle causing surface stain. Removal of extrinsic staining Extrinsic staining may be removed through various treatment methods: *Prophylaxis: dental prophylaxis includes the removal of extrinsic staining using a slow-speed rotary handpiece and a rubber cup with abrasive paste, mostly containing fluoride. The abrasive nature of the prophy paste, as it is known, acts to remove extrinsic staining using the action of the slow-speed handpiece and the paste against the tooth. Adversely, the action of the rubber cup together with the abrasive nature of the paste, removes around one micron of enamel from the tooth surface every time a prophylaxis is performed. This method of stain removal may only take place in the dental office. *Toothpaste: there are many available on the market that implement both peroxide as well as abrasive particles such as silica gel to help remove extrinsic stains while the peroxide acts on intrinsic staining. This method of stain removal may take place at home as well as in a dental office. *Micro-abrasion: allows a dental professional to make use of an instrument which emits a powder, water and compressed air to remove biofilm, and extrinsic staining. This stain removal method can only be undertaken in a dental office, not at home. =Intrinsic staining= Intrinsic staining primarily occurs during the tooth development either before birth or at early childhood. Intrinsic stains are those that cannot be removed through mechanical measures such as debridement or a prophylactic stain removal. As the age of the person increases, the teeth can also appear yellower over time. Below are examples of intrinsic sources of stains: *Tooth wear and ageing: Tooth wear is a progressive loss of enamel and dentine due to tooth erosion, abrasion and attrition. As enamel wears down, dentine becomes more apparent and chromogenic agents are penetrated in the tooth more easily. The natural production of secondary dentine also gradually darkens teeth with age. *Dental caries (tooth decay): The evidence regarding carious tooth discolouration is inconclusive, however the most reliable evidence suggests that carious lesion allows for exogenous agents to enter dentine and hence increased absorption of chromogenic agents causing discolouration to the tooth. *Restorative materials: The materials used during root canal treatments, such as eugenol and phenolic compounds, contain pigment that stain dentine. Restorations using amalgam also penetrate dentine tubules with tin over time therefore causing dark stains to the tooth. *Dental trauma which may cause staining either as a result of pulp necrosis or internal resorption. Alternatively the tooth may become darker without pulp necrosis. *Enamel hypoplasia: Enamel hypoplasia causes enamel to be thin and weak. It produces a yellow-brown discolouration and can also cause the enamel's smooth surface to be rough and pitted which causes the tooth to be susceptible to extrinsic staining, tooth sensitivity, malocclusion, and dental caries. The evidence regarding enamel hypoplasia is inconclusive, however the most likely cause is infection or trauma caused to the primary dentition. Disturbances to the developing tooth germ during neonatal and early childhood stages such as maternal vitamin D deficiency, infection, and medication intake can cause enamel hypoplasia. * Pulpal hyperemia: Pulpal hyperemia refers to inflammation of a traumatised tooth which can be caused by a stimuli such as trauma, thermal shock, or dental caries. Pulpal hyperemia is reversible and produces a red hue seen initially after trauma which has the ability to disappear if the tooth becomes revascularized. *Fluorosis: Dental fluorosis causes enamel to become opaque, chalky white, and porous. The enamel can break down and cause the exposed subsurface enamel to become mottled and produce extrinsic dark brown-black stains. Dental fluorosis occurs due to excessive ingestion of fluoride or overexposure to fluoride during the development of enamel which usually occurs between the ages of one to four. Fluoridated drinking water, fluoride supplements, topical fluoride (fluoride toothpastes), and formula prescribed for children can increase the risk of dental fluorosis. Fluoride is considered an important factor in the management and prevention of dental caries, the safe level for daily fluoride intake is 0.05 to 0.07 mg/kg/day. *Dentinogenesis imperfecta: Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a hereditary dentine defect, associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, which causes the tooth to become discoloured usually blue or brown in colour and translucent giving teeth an opalescent sheen. The condition is autosomal dominant which means that the condition runs in the family. *Amelogenesis imperfecta: The appearance of amelogenesis imperfecta depends on the type of amelogenesis, there are 14 different subtypes and can vary from the appearance of hypoplasia to hypomineralisation which can produce different appearances of enamel from white mottling to yellow brown appearances. * Tetracycline and minocycline. Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and its derivative minocycline is common in the treatment of acne. The drug is able to chelate calcium ions and is incorporated into teeth, cartilage, and bone. Ingestion during the years of tooth development causes yellow-green discoloration of dentine visible through the enamel which is fluorescent under ultraviolet light. Later, the tetracycline is oxidized and the staining becomes more brown and no longer fluoresces under UV light. * Porphyria: A rare metabolic disorder in which the body fails to adequately metabolise porphyrins, which leads to accumulation or excretion of porphyrins into teeth. The excretion of porphyrins produces purple-red pigments in teeth. * Hemolytic disease of the newborn: This disease occurs when a newborn's red blood cells are being attacked by antibodies from the mother caused by an incompatibility between the mother and baby's blood. This condition can produce green staining of teeth due to jaundice, which is an inability to excrete bilirubin properly. * Root resorption: Root resorption is clinically asymptomatic, however can produce a pink appearance at the amelocemental junction. * Alkaptonuria: Metabolic disorder which promotes the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the body and may cause brown colour pigmentation in the teeth, gums, and buccal mucosa. Methods Prior to proceeding to tooth whitening alternatives, it is advised that the patient comes into the dental office to have a comprehensive oral examination that consists of a full medical, dental, and social history. This will allow the clinician to see if there is any treatment that needs to be done such as restorations to remove caries, and to assess whether or not the patient will be a good candidate to have the whitening done. The clinician would then debride (clean) the tooth surface with an ultrasonic scaler, hand instruments, and potentially a prophy paste to remove extrinsic stains as mentioned above. This will allow a clean surface for maximum benefits of whichever tooth whitening method the patient chooses. Below will discuss the various types of tooth whitening methods including both internal application of bleaching and external application through the use of bleaching agents. =In-office= Before the treatment, the clinician should examine the patient: taking a health and dental history (including allergies and sensitivities), observe hard and soft tissues, placement and conditions of restorations, and sometimes x-rays to determine the nature and depth of possible irregularities. If this is not completed prior to the whitening agents being applied to the tooth surface, excessive sensitivity and other complications may occur. The whitening shade guides are used to measure tooth colour. These shades determine the effectiveness of the whitening procedure, which may vary from two to seven shades. These shades may be reached after a single in office appointment, or may take longer, depending on the individual. The effects of bleaching can last for several months, but may vary depending on the lifestyle of the patient. Consuming tooth staining foods or drinks that have a strong colour may compromise effectiveness of the treatment. These include food and drinks containing tannins such as; coffee, tea, red wines, and curry. In- office bleaching procedures generally use a light-cured protective layer that is carefully painted on the gums and papilla (the tips of the gums between the teeth) to reduce the risk of chemical burns to the soft tissues. The bleaching agent is either carbamide peroxide, which breaks down in the mouth to form hydrogen peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide itself. The bleaching gel typically contains between 10% and 44% carbamide peroxide, which is roughly equivalent to a 3% to 16% hydrogen peroxide concentration. The legal percentage of hydrogen peroxide allowed to be given is 0.1–6%. Bleaching agents are only allowed to be given by dental practitioners, dental therapists, and dental hygienists. Bleaching is least effective when the original tooth color is grayish and may require custom bleaching trays. Bleaching is most effective with yellow discolored teeth. If heavy staining or tetracycline damage is present on a patient's teeth, and whitening is ineffective (tetracycline staining may require prolonged bleaching, as it takes longer for the bleach to reach the dentine layer), there are other methods of masking the stain. Bonding, which also masks tooth stains, is when a thin coating of composite material is applied to the front of a person's teeth and then cured with a blue light. A veneer can also mask tooth discoloration. In-chair whitening is faster and more effective in comparison to the take-home bleaching options. Some clinicians also make custom bleaching trays for you, which can take up to a week to create, so that after the whitening treatment is completed, you are able to use these trays in the future for maintenance of your bleaching with at home kits or for the use of desensitising products. Light-accelerated bleaching Power or light-accelerated bleaching uses light energy which is intended to accelerate the process of bleaching in a dental office. Different types of energy can be used in this procedure, with the most common being halogen, LED, or plasma arc. Use of light during bleaching increases the risk of tooth sensitivity and may not be any more effective than bleaching without light when high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used. A 2015 study showed that the use of a light activator does not improve bleaching, has no measurable effect, and rather is likely to increase the temperature of the associated tissues, resulting in damage. The ideal source of energy should be high energy to excite the peroxide molecules without overheating the pulp of the tooth. Lights are typically within the blue light spectrum as this has been found to contain the most effective wavelengths for initiating the hydrogen peroxide reaction. A power bleaching treatment typically involves isolation of soft tissue with a resin-based, light-curable barrier, application of a professional dental-grade hydrogen peroxide whitening gel (25–38% hydrogen peroxide), and exposure to the light source for 6–15 minutes. Recent technical advances have minimized heat and UV emissions, allowing for a shorter patient preparation procedure. For any whitening treatments, it is recommended that a comprehensive examination of the patient is done including the use of radiographs to aid in the diagnosis of the current condition of the mouth, including any allergies that may be present. The patient will need to have a healthy mouth and free of periodontal disease or caries and to have had a debridement/clean done to remove any tartar or plaque build up. It is recommended to avoid smoking, drinking red wine, eating or drinking any deeply coloured foods after this as the teeth may stain considerably straight after treatment. Nanoparticle catalysts for reduced hydrogen peroxide concentration A recent addition to the field is new light-accelerated bleaching agents containing lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide with a titanium oxide nanoparticle-based catalyst. Reduced concentrations of hydrogen peroxide cause lower incidences of tooth hypersensitivity. The nanoparticles act as photocatalysts, and their size prevents them from diffusing deeply into the tooth. When exposed to light, the catalysts produce a rapid, localized breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into highly reactive radicals. Due to the extremely short lifetimes of the free radicals, they are able to produce bleaching effects similar to much higher concentration bleaching agents within the outer layers of the teeth where the nanoparticle catalysts are located. This provides effective tooth whitening while reducing the required concentration of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive byproducts at the tooth pulp. = Internal bleaching = Internal bleaching is a process which occurs after a tooth has been endodontically treated. This means that the tooth will have had the nerve of the tooth extirpated or removed through a root canal treatment at the dentist or by a specialist endodontist. Internal bleaching is often sought after in teeth which have been endodontically treated as tooth discolouration becomes a problem due to the lack of nerve supply to that tooth. It is common to have this internal bleaching done on an anterior tooth (a front tooth that you can see when smiling and talking). A way around this is by sealing off the bleaching agent inside the tooth itself and replacing it every few weeks until the desired shade has been achieved. The amount of time between appointments varies from patient to patient and with operator preference until the desired shade has been achieved. Even though this is a great option, the disadvantage of this treatment is a risk of internal root resorption of the tooth that is being internally bleached. This may not occur in every patient or every tooth, and its occurrence is difficult to determine prior to completing the treatment. =At home= At home tooth whitening products are available from dentists or 'over the counter' (OTC). At home whitening methods include over-the-counter strips and gels, whitening rinses, whitening toothpastes, and tray-based tooth whiteners. OTC products can be used for milder cases of tooth staining. Home-based bleaching (following manufacturer's instructions) results in less tooth sensitivity than in-office bleaching. Strips and gels The plastic whitening strips contain a thin layer of peroxide gel and are shaped to fit the buccal/labial surfaces of teeth. Many different types of whitening strips are available on the market, after being introduced in the late 1980s. Specific whitening strip products have their own set of instructions however the strips are typically applied twice daily for 30 minutes for 14 days. In several days, tooth colour can lighten by 1 or 2 shades. The tooth whitening endpoint does depend on the frequency of use and ingredients of the product. Whitening gels are applied onto the tooth surface with a small brush. The gels contain peroxide and are recommended to be applied twice a day for 14 days. The tooth whitening endpoint like that of the whitening strips. Rinses Whitening rinses work by reaction of the oxygen sources such as hydrogen peroxide within the rinse and the chromogens on or within the tooth. It is recommended to use twice a day, rinsing for one minute. To see an improvement in shade colour, it can take up to three months. Toothpastes Whitening toothpastes differ from regular toothpastes in that they contain higher amounts of abrasives and detergents to be more effective at removing tougher stains. Some whitening toothpastes contain low concentrations of carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide which help lighten tooth colour however they do not contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite). With continuity of use over time, tooth colour can lighten by one or two shades. Tray-based Tray-based tooth whitening is achieved by wearing a fitted tray containing carbamide peroxide bleaching gel overnight or for two to four hours a day. If manufacturer's instructions are followed, tooth whitening can occur within three days and lighten teeth by one or two shades. This type of tooth whitening is available over-the-counter and professionally from an oral health professional. Baking soda Baking soda is a safe, low abrasive, and effective stain removal and tooth whitening toothpaste. Tooth whitening toothpaste that have excessive abrasivity are harmful to dental tissue, therefore baking soda is a desirable alternative. To date, clinical studies on baking soda report that there have been no reported adverse effects. It also contains acid-buffering components that makes baking soda biologically antibacterial at high concentrations and capable of preventing growth of Streptococcus mutans. Baking soda might be useful for caries-prone patients as well as those who wish to have whiter teeth. Indications Tooth whitening may be undertaken for a variety of reasons, but whitening may also be recommended to some individuals by dental professionals. * Intrinsic tooth staining * Aesthetics * Dental fluorosis * Endodontic treatment (internal bleaching) * Tetracycline staining Contraindications Some groups are advised to carry out tooth whitening with caution as they may be at higher risk of adverse effects. * Patients with unrealistic expectations * Allergy to peroxide * Pre-existing sensitive teeth * Cracks or exposed dentine * Enamel development defects * Acid erosion * Receding gums (gingival recession) and yellow roots * Sensitive gums * Defective dental restorations * Tooth decay. White-spot decalcification may be highlighted and become more noticeable directly following a whitening process, but with further applications the other parts of the teeth usually become more white and the spots less noticeable. * Active periapical pathology * Untreated periodontal disease * Pregnant or lactating women * Children under the age of 16. This is because the pulp chamber, or nerve of the tooth, is enlarged until this age. Tooth whitening under this condition could irritate the pulp or cause it to become sensitive. Younger people are also more susceptible to abusing bleaching. * Persons with visible white fillings or crowns. Tooth whitening does not change the color of fillings and other restorative materials. It does not affect porcelain, other ceramics, or dental gold. However, it can slightly affect restorations made with composite materials, cements and dental amalgams. Tooth whitening will not restore color of fillings, porcelain, and other ceramics when they become stained by foods, drinks, and smoking, as these products are only effective on natural tooth structure. As such, a shade mismatch may be created as the natural tooth surfaces increase in whiteness and the restorations stay the same shade. Whitening agents do not work where bonding has been used and neither is it effective on tooth-colored filling materials. Other options to deal with such cases are the porcelain veneers or dental bonding. * Individuals with poor oral hygiene Risks Some of the common side effects involved in teeth whitening are increased sensitivity of the teeth, gum irritation, and extrinsic teeth discolouration. =Hypersensitivity= The use of bleach with extremely low pH levels in the tooth whitening procedure may lead to hypersensitive teeth, as it causes the dentinal tubules to open. Exposure to cold, hot, or sweet stimuli may further exacerbate the intensity of the hypersensitive response. Amongst those who receive in-office whitening treatment, between 67–78% of the individuals experience sensitivity after the procedure where hydrogen peroxide and heat is utilised. Although it varies from person to person, sensitivity after whitening treatment can last up to 4–39 days. Potassium nitrate and sodium fluoride in toothpastes are used to ease discomfort following bleaching, however, there is no evidence to suggest that this is a permanent method to eradicate the issue of hypersensitivity. =Irritation of mucous membranes= Hydrogen peroxide is an irritant and cytotoxic. Hydrogen peroxide with concentrations of 10% or higher can cause tissue damage, be corrosive to mucous membranes and cause burning sensation to the skin. Chemical burns can commonly occur whilst bleaching, irritation and discolouration of the mucous membranes may occur if a high concentration of oxidising agent comes in to contact with unprotected tissue. Poorly fitting bleaching trays are amongst the most common reasons for chemical burns. The temporary burning induced by whitening treatments can be reduced by using custom-made plastic trays or nightguards provided by the dental professional. This prevents the leakage of solution onto the surrounding mucosa. =Uneven results= Uneven results are quite common after bleaching. Consuming less foods and drinks that cause surface staining of teeth can contribute to attaining a good result from tooth whitening. =Return to original pre- treatment shade= Nearly half the initial change in colour provided by an intensive in-office treatment (i.e., one hour treatment in a dentist's chair) may be lost in seven days. Rebound is experienced when a large proportion of the tooth whitening has come from tooth dehydration (also a significant factor in causing sensitivity). As the tooth rehydrates, tooth colour \\"rebounds\\", back toward where it started. =Over-bleaching= Over-bleaching, more often known as the \\"bleached effect\\", occurs among treatments that promise a large change over a short period of time e.g., hours. Over-bleaching can emit a translucent and brittle appearance. =Damage to enamel= Teeth enamel can have an adverse negative effect by whitening treatment. Evidence from studies show that carbamide peroxide present in whitening gels can damage the enamel surface. Although this effect is not as damaging as phosphoric acid etch,Haywood, Van & Houck, V.M. & Heymann, H.O.. (1991). Nightguard vital bleaching: Effects of various solutions on enamel surface texture and color. Quintessence Int. 22. 775–782. the increased irregularity of the teeth surface makes the teeth more susceptible to extrinsic staining, thus having an increased detrimental effect on the aesthetics. The increased porosity and changes in surface roughness may have an impact on the formation of supra- and subgingival plaque, thus increasing the adhesion of bacterial species such as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, significant contributors to dental caries. Dental restorations are susceptible to unacceptable colour change even when using the home-based systems. =Weakened dentine= Intracoronal bleaching is a tooth whitening method that uses 30% more hydrogen peroxide. Such tooth whitening methods can weaken the mechanical properties of dentine and could potentially lead to severe tooth sensitivity. =Effects on existing restorations= Dental restorations are susceptible to unacceptable colour change even when using the home-based systems. Ceramic Crowns – aggressive bleaching can chemically react with ceramic crowns and reduce their stability. Dental amalgam – exposure to carbamide peroxide solutions increase mercury release for one to two days. The release of amalgam components is said to be due to active oxidation. This increase in amalgam mercury release is proportional to the concentration of carbamide peroxide. Resin composite – bond strength between enamel and resin based fillings become weakened. Many studies have found that 10-16% carbamide peroxide tooth bleaching gels (containing approximately 3.6-5.76% hydrogen peroxide) leads to an increase in the surface roughness and porosity of composite resins. However, the saliva may exert a protective effect. In addition, changes in the reflectance of the composite have been analysed following whitening with high concentration (30-35%) hydrogen peroxide. This suggests that tooth whitening negatively impacts composite resin restorations. Glass ionomer and other cements – studies suggest that solubility of these materials may increase. =Bleachorexia= Bleachorexia is the term that is used to describe an individual that develops an unhealthy obsession with teeth whitening. This condition is similar to body dysmorphic disorder. The characteristics of bleachorexia are the continuous use of whitening products even though the teeth cannot possibly become whiter, despite the provision of repeated treatment. A person with bleachorexia will continually seek out for different whitening products, hence, it is recommended that a target shade is agreed upon before starting the treatment procedure to help with this problem. = Home teeth whitening risks = The use of personalised home whitening trays is a patient administered therapy that is prescribed and dispensed by a dentist. Patients need to actively participate in their treatment and follow the guidelines given by the dentist accurately. Erratic or inaccurate use of the bleaching trays could cause harm to the patient such as blistering or sensitivity of the teeth and the surrounding soft tissue. Inconsistent use of the bleaching trays can lead to the slowing and irregularity of the whitening process. Some patients with a substantial gag reflex may not be able to tolerate the trays and would need to consider other methods of teeth whitening. =Other risks= Evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide might act as a tumour promoter. Although cervical root resorption is more evidently observed in thermocatalytic bleaching methods, intracoronal internal bleaching may also lead to tooth root resorption. Moreover, severe damage to intracoronal dentine and tooth crown fracture can occur due to this bleaching method. However, the International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to prove that hydrogen peroxide is a carcinogen to humans. Recently, the genotoxic potential of hydrogen peroxide was evaluated. The results indicated that the oral health products that contain or release hydrogen peroxide up to 3.6% will not increase the cancerous risk of an individual,SCCNFP (1999). Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers. Hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide releasing substances in oral health products. SCCNFP/0058/98. Summary on http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/sccp/out83_en.html and http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/sccp/out89_en.html(read 2002.31.10) hence, it is safe to use in moderation. Maintenance Despite achieving the results of treatment, stains can return within an initial couple of months of treatment. Various methods may be employed to prolong the treatment results, such as: * Brush or flush out mouth with water after eating and drinking * Floss to remove plaque and biofilms between the teeth * Take special care during the first 2 days – the first 24–48 hours after the whitening procedure is seen as the most crucial period in which you must protect for your teeth the most. Hence, it is vital that non-staining drinks or foods are eaten during this time as enamel is prone to adhere to stains. * Drink fluids that may cause staining through a straw * Depending on the method used to whiten the teeth, re-treatment every six months or after a year may be required. If an individual is a smoker or they consume beverages with the capacity to stain, regular re-treatments would be required. History Teeth whitening remedies have been present since ancient times. Despite seeming absurd, some methods were somewhat effective in their results. The Ancient Romans believed in using urine with goat milk to make their teeth look whiter. Pearly white teeth symbolized beauty and marked wealth. In the Auyrveda medicine system, oil pulling was used as an oral therapy. For this process today, swish coconut or olive oil in your mouth for up to 20 minutes each day. In the late 17th century, many people reached out to barbers, who used a file to file down the teeth before applying an acid that would, in fact, whiten the teeth. Although the procedure was successful, the teeth would become completely eroded and more prone to becoming decayed. Guy de Chauliac suggested the following to whiten the teeth: \\"Clean the teeth gently with a mixture of honey and burnt salt to which some vinegar has been added.\\" In 1877, oxalic acid was proposed for whitening, followed by calcium hypochlorite. In the late 1920s, mouthwash containing pyrozone (ether peroxide) was found to reduce caries while providing a whiter appearance to the teeth. By 1940s and 1950s, ether and hydrogen peroxide gels were used to whiten vital teeth, whereas non-vital teeth were whitened using pyrozone and sodium perborate. In the late 1960s, Dr William Klusmeier, an Orthodontist from Fort Smith, Arkansas, introduced the custom tray bleaching. However, it was not until 1989 when Haywood and Heymann published an article that supported this method. Carbamide peroxide with a shelf life of one to two years, as opposed to hydrogen peroxide with a shelf life one to two months, was seen as a more stable agent for whitening teeth. Society and culture Teeth whitening has become the most promoted and mentioned methodology in cosmetic dentistry. In excess of 100 million Americans brighten their teeth using different methods; spending $15 billion in 2010.Krupp, Charla. (2008). How Not To Look Old. New York: Springboard Press, p.95. The US Food and Drug Administration only endorses gels that are under 6% hydrogen peroxide or 16% or less of carbamide peroxide. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety of the EU consider gels containing higher fixations can be dangerous. As per European Council guidelines, only a certified dental professional can lawfully give tooth whitening products utilizing 0.1–6% hydrogen peroxide, provided the patient is 18 years of age or older. In 2010, the UK General Dental Council became concerned of the \\"risk to patient safety from poor quality tooth whitening being carried out by untrained or poorly trained staff.\\" A public attitudes survey, conducted by the GDC, showed that 83% of people support \\"policies of regulating tooth whitening to protect patient safety and prosecuting illegal practice.\\" A group of dental professionals and associations called The Tooth Whitening Information Group (TWIG) was founded to advance protected and beneficial tooth whitening information and assistance to the general population. Reports can be made to the TWIG through their website with respect to any individual giving unlawful tooth whitening services, or if an individual has personally undergone treatment done by a non-dental professional. In Brazil, all whitening items are classed as cosmetics (Degree II). There are worries that this will bring about increasing abuse of whitening products and thus there have been calls for reanalysis. According to research, tooth whitening can produce positive changes in young participants’ Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) in aesthetic areas such as smiling, laughing, and showing teeth without embarrassment. However, its main side-effect, tooth sensitivity, does negatively affect quality of life.

The debtor pledged his person as collateral if he defaulted on his loan. Nexum was abolished by the Lex Poetelia Papiria in 326 BC.  Contract  Nexum was a form of mancipatio, a symbolic transfer of rights that involved a set of scales, copper weights and a formulaic oath.Speake, Graham. A Dictionary of Ancient History. Basil Blackwell Ltd. Cambridge, Massachusetts: 1994. pp. 392, 436 Under the contract, a free man became a bond slave, or nexus, until he could pay off his debt to the creditor. Varro derives the word nexum from nec suum, \\"not one's own\\" and although that etymology is incorrect in light of modern scientific linguistics, it illuminates how the Roman understood the term.Varro. On the Latin Language: Book VII. Trans. Roland G. Kent. On the Latin Language I: Books V-VII. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1938. pp 359-361 It remains unclear whether debtors entered into a nexum contract initially with their loan or if they voluntarily after they could not pay off an existing debt, but the former seems more likely to be the case.The Cambridge Ancient History 2nd Ed. Vol. VII Vol. II: The Rise of Rome to 220 BC. Cambridge University Press. Great Britain: 1990. p 215 Additionally, there is no single formal nexum contract that all nexi entered. It is possible that there were many variations of the nexum contract, and that the details of nexum contracts were worked out on a case-by-case basis.The Cambridge Ancient History 2nd Ed. Vol. VII Vol. II: The Rise of Rome to 220 BC. Cambridge University Press. Great Britain: 1990. p 330 Debt bondage existed in the early Republic largely as a result of increasing control over the ager publicus, or public land, by individuals who acquired disproportionate wealth and power and distorted the republican ideal of a commonwealth. As farmers and laborers lost access to the land that was theoretically held in common by the Roman people (populus Romanus), they were unable to earn a living, and nexum was resorted to as security for debts.The Cambridge Ancient History 2nd Ed. Vol. VII Vol. II: The Rise of Rome to 220 BC. Cambridge University Press. Great Britain: 1990. p 331 Despite constraining a free person's liberty (libertas), nexum contracts were a preferable alternative to slavery for debtors since slaves could be sold or killed by their masters at will. Though nexi were often beaten and abused by their creditors, they maintained (if sometimes only in theory) their Roman citizenship and rights.The Cambridge Ancient History 2nd Ed. Vol. VII Vol. II: The Rise of Rome to 220 BC. Cambridge University Press. Great Britain: 1990. p 209 Creditors might profit more from a nexum contract, as they received a motivated contractual worker instead of a slave. An indebted paterfamilias, or legal head of the Roman household, might offer his son for nexum, instead of himself.Watson, Alan. Rome of the XII Tables: Person and Property. Princeton University Press. Princeton, N.J: 1975. p 115.  Abolishment  According to the Augustan-era historian Livy, nexum was abolished because of the excessive cruelty and lust of a single usurer, Lucius Papirius. In 326 BC, a young boy named Gaius Publilius was guarantor to his father’s debt, becoming the nexus of Papirius. (In another version, Dionysius of Halicarnassus records that Publilius borrowed the money for his father’s funeral.)Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Roman Antiquities: Book XVI. Trans. Earnest Cary. Roman Antiquities Vol. VII: Books XI-XX. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1950. pp 323-325 The boy was noted for his youth and beauty, and Papirius desired him sexually.Although slaves were subject to sexual use by their masters, citizens who fell into debt bondage were not supposed to surrender the physical autonomy that protected the free from corporal punishment or sexual abuse; see discussion of master-slave sexual relations in ancient Rome. He tried to seduce Publilius with “lewd conversation\\", but when the boy failed to respond, Papirius grew impatient and reminded the boy of his position as bond slave. When the boy again refused his forceful advances, Papirius had him stripped and lashed. The wounded boy ran into the street, and an outcry among the people led the consuls to convene the senate, resulting in the Lex Poetelia Papiria, which forbade holding debtors in bondage for their debt and required instead that the debtor’s property be used as collateral. All people confined under the nexum contract were released, and nexum as a form of legal contract was forbidden thereafter.Livy, History of Rome VIII.28, \\"The Perseus Digital Library\\". Retrieved on May 10, 2007. Varro alternatively dates the abolishment of nexum to 313 BC, during the dictatorship of Gaius Poetelius Libo Visolus. Poetelius, after whom the Lex Poetelia Papiria is named, held his third consulship in 326 BC, the date that Livy records. Cicero considered the abolishment of nexum primarily a political maneuver to temporarily appease the plebeian masses, who by Cicero’s time (almost 300 years after the Lex Poetelia Papiria) had carried out three full-scale secessions: > When the plebeians have been so weakened by the expenditures brought on by a > public calamity that they give way under their burden, some relief or remedy > has been sought for the difficulties of this class, for the sake of the > safety of the whole body of citizens.Cicero. The Republic II. Trans. Clinton > W. Keyes. On the Republic. On the Laws. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard > University Press, 1928. p 171 Though nexum as a legal contract was abolished, debt bondage persisted in the case of defaulting debtors since a court could grant creditors the right to take insolvent debtors as bond slaves.Brunt, P.A.

Mbaye has developed a unique Senegalese guitar style in which he makes his Fender Stratocaster sound like local instruments such as the kora or xalam. Style Mbaye is different from other guitarists because of his unique style. Youssou Ndour said \\"No one, no one plays guitar like Jimi Mbaye. His playing style is unique\\". Mbaye succeeded in transposing the African traditional sounds of khalam (Ngoni) and kora onto his electric Fender Stratocaster. Carlos Santana and Mbaye met during a tour in Los Angeles where Carlos acknowledged that: \\"Jimi is a very special and incredible guitarist\\". Jimi has also proven to be a good singer, very melodic, a true harmonicist. Albums Mbaye has released three solo albums, \\"Dakar Heart\\", \\"Yaye Digalma\\" and \\"Khare Dounya\\". The latter was recorded in Jimi's new studio Studio Dogo, in which he produces other artists. Early years At ten years old Mbaye built his first guitar out of fishing line and gasoline cans. At twenty he'd scraped up enough money to buy a secondhand Fender Stratocaster. Mbaye was just as determined to get a guitar as he was to make it in the competitive Dakar music scene. Early on he met Youssou N'Dour and together they became rising stars on Senegal's club scene, playing mbalax music. They created the \\"Super Etoile\\" band together in 1981 and have been musically inseparable for all these years. Later works Mbaye recorded six top-selling major-label albums with N'Dour before taking a leave of absence to record his own solo album, released in 1997, \\"Dakar Heart\\". Recorded at N'Dour's Studio Xippi, \\"Dakar Heart\\" features N'Dour's band \\"Super Etoile\\". Mbaye is back at N'Dour's side and is very much an integral part of Youssou's \\"Super Etoile\\" band these days. In fact, Youssou often travels abroad with only Mbaye as acoustic guitar accompanist, as he did in June, 1998 for performances in Paris as guests of Brazilian performer Gilberto Gil at the Olympia Theatre. A member of Youssou N'Dour's Super Etoile Band since 1979, Mbaye is one of Senegal's most influential guitarists. Often compared to Jimi Hendrix and Robert Johnson, Mbaye has forged a unique blend of traditional Senegalese roots music and American pop and R&B.; Recording a solo album, Dakar Heart, with help from Super Etoile Band musicians in 1997, Mbaye showcased his inventive, kora-derived guitar playing and singing in Wolof, English, and French. Billboard called him \\"a prodigious world talent,\\" while Rhythm referred to him as \\"one of Senegal's most exciting musicians.\\" Music has played an ongoing role in Mbaye's life. As a youngster, he performed on a self-invented instrument made from discarded garbage cans and nylon fishing line in the streets of Dakar. By the age of 20, he had graduated to a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Mbaye continues to be the backbone of N'Dour's band. In addition to co-writing the 1994 single \\"Mame Bamba,\\" he has made valuable contributions to six N'Dour recordings. Mbaye and N'Dour have increasingly performed as a duo. In 1998, they opened the show for Brazilian guitarist Gilberto Gil at the Olympic Theater in Paris. Mbaye is one of Africa's greatest guitarists. He has played in Youssou N'dour's Super Etoile since 1979. Now he has a solo album, Dakar Heart, on which he sings as well as plays guitar. The album is available from Shanachie Records, catalog #64094. In Europe, it's distributed by BMG France. Dakar Heart skillfully blends Senegalese mbalax with American pop & R&B; for a powerful new sound. Collaborations The third album called “Khare Dounya” was released in 2012. “Khare Dounya” means “Fight for Life”. He recorded this album with his band “Group Dogo”. It’s an album where Mbaye shows really his musicality. He started to tour with his band around the country (Senegal) and the West African region. Since he had his studio Mbaye often collaborated with many artists from Africa and the rest of the world. We remember the album Daxaar with the late jazz drummer Steve Reid recorded in Mbaye’s studio Dogo in Dakar. He’s friendly with many musicians. During gigs he would rehearse with other artists to create new songs they could record later to advance their own careers. He often produces albums for musicians in Senegal.

The novel is narrated as a retrospective by John Brown's son, Owen Brown, from his hermitage in the San Gabriel Mountains of California. His reminiscences are triggered by the reception of an invitation from a Miss Mayo, assistant to Oswald Garrison Villard, then researching his book John Brown: A Biography Fifty Years After (Boston, 1910). Major themes Banks raises a number of thematic questions during the lengthy portrayal of his subject matter. Notable among them are: *How emotional attachment and hermetic exile provide for an unreliable narration. *The moral consequences of Radicalism: violent vs. non-violent protest. *The fine line between sanity and religious fanaticism: \\"...the Lord speaks to me.\\" *How strong familial attachment is itself a form of slavery. *Loss of innocence. *Your actions affect those around you (John Brown with his family and friends). The narrative style employed by Banks is introspective and apologetic where each character's moral compass is seen as through the microscope of Owen Brown's telling; detailed and larger than life. Bank's prose uses language that registers on the psyche: evoking the conviction that redemption can be gained by an Augustinian confession. And yet the reader is goaded into sympathy with these characters by their sheer persistence in the face of seemingly insurmountable daily travails - evoking the innocence of a new-born country. Literary license Banks takes great license with some of the historical figures in his narrative and very clearly states in his preface that his book is a work of fiction and not to be substituted for a work of biography or history. Perhaps most significant is the later life of Owen Brown; the historical Owen Brown died in 1889 at the age of 64 while his literary counterpart lives for decades longer. Reception The novel was reviewed positively in a number of places: * \\"Russell Banks has created in Cloudsplitter an immediate landmark in American fiction\\" * \\"Masterly... a furious, sprawling drama that commands attention like thunder heard from just over the horizon.\\" Time Magazine (quoted in:) * \\"...a novel of near-biblical proportions about the abolitionist freedom fighter John Brown, is shaped like an explosive with an exceedingly long and winding fuse.\\" In 2011, The Guardian's Tom Cox selected Cloudsplitter as one of his \\"overlooked classics of American literature\\". Awards and nominations *PEN/Faulkner finalist *Pulitzer Prize finalist Adaptations In 2002, it was reported that Martin Scorsese was to produce a film adaptation of Cloudsplitter, to be directed by Raoul Peck, for the film production company HBO.

NL is a generalization of L, the class for logspace problems on a deterministic Turing machine. Since any deterministic Turing machine is also a nondeterministic Turing machine, we have that L is contained in NL. NL can be formally defined in terms of the computational resource nondeterministic space (or NSPACE) as NL = NSPACE(log n). Important results in complexity theory allow us to relate this complexity class with other classes, telling us about the relative power of the resources involved. Results in the field of algorithms, on the other hand, tell us which problems can be solved with this resource. Like much of complexity theory, many important questions about NL are still open (see Unsolved problems in computer science). Occasionally NL is referred to as RL due to its probabilistic definition below; however, this name is more frequently used to refer to randomized logarithmic space, which is not known to equal NL. NL-complete problems Several problems are known to be NL-complete under log-space reductions, including ST-connectivity and 2-satisfiability. ST-connectivity asks for nodes S and T in a directed graph whether T is reachable from S. 2-satisfiability asks, given a formula of which each clause is the disjunction of two literals, if there is a variable assignment that makes the formula true. An example instance, where eg indicates not, might be: :(x_1 \\\\vee eg x_3) \\\\wedge ( eg x_2 \\\\vee x_3) \\\\wedge ( eg x_1 \\\\vee eg x_2) Containments It is known that is contained in , since there is a polynomial-time algorithm for 2-satisfiability, but it is not known whether or whether . It is known that , where is the class of languages whose complements are in . This result (the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem) was independently discovered by Neil Immerman and Róbert Szelepcsényi in 1987; they received the 1995 Gödel Prize for this work. In circuit complexity, can be placed within the hierarchy. In Papadimitriou 1994, Theorem 16.1, we have: :\\\\mathsf{NC_1 \\\\subseteq L \\\\subseteq NL \\\\subseteq NC_2}. More precisely, is contained in . It is known that is equal to , the class of problems solvable by randomized algorithms in logarithmic space and unbounded time, with no error. It is not, however, known or believed to be equal to or , the polynomial-time restrictions of and which some authors refer to as and . We can relate to deterministic space using Savitch's theorem, which tells us that any nondeterministic algorithm can be simulated by a deterministic machine in at most quadratically more space. From Savitch's theorem, we have directly that: :\\\\mathsf{NL \\\\subseteq SPACE}(\\\\log^2 n) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{equivalently, } \\\\mathsf{NL \\\\subseteq L}^2. This was the strongest deterministic-space inclusion known in 1994 (Papadimitriou 1994 Problem 16.4.10, \\"Symmetric space\\"). Since larger space classes are not affected by quadratic increases, the nondeterministic and deterministic classes are known to be equal, so that for example we have . Alternative definitions =Probabilistic definition= Suppose C is the complexity class of decision problems solvable in logarithmithic space with probabilistic Turing machines that never accept incorrectly but are allowed to reject incorrectly less than 1/3 of the time; this is called one-sided error. The constant 1/3 is arbitrary; any x with 0 ≤ x < 1/2 would suffice. It turns out that C = NL. Notice that C, unlike its deterministic counterpart L, is not limited to polynomial time, because although it has a polynomial number of configurations it can use randomness to escape an infinite loop. If we do limit it to polynomial time, we get the class RL, which is contained in but not known or believed to equal NL. There is a simple algorithm which establishes that C = NL. Clearly C is contained in NL, since: * If the string is not in the language, both reject along all computation paths. * If the string is in the language, an NL algorithm accepts along at least one computation path and a C algorithm accepts along at least two-thirds of its computation paths. To show that NL is contained in C, we simply take an NL algorithm and choose a random computation path of length n, and do this 2n times. Because no computation path exceeds length n, and because there are 2n computation paths in all, we have a good chance of hitting the accepting one (bounded below by a constant). The only problem is that we don't have room in log space for a binary counter that goes up to 2n. To get around this we replace it with a randomized counter, which simply flips n coins and stops and rejects if they all land on heads. Since this event has probability 2−n, we expect to take 2n steps on average before stopping. It only needs to keep a running total of the number of heads in a row it sees, which it can count in log space. Because of the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, according to which NL is closed under complements, the one-sided error in these probabilistic computations can be replaced by zero-sided error. That is, these problems can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines that use logarithmic space and never make errors. The corresponding complexity class that also requires the machine to use only polynomial time is called ZPLP. Thus, when we only look at space alone, it seems that randomization and nondeterminism are equally powerful. =Certificate definition= NL can equivalently be characterised by certificates, analogous to classes such as NP. Consider a deterministic logarithmic-space bounded Turing machine that has an additional read-only read-once input tape. A language is in NL if and only if such a Turing machine accepts any word in the language for an appropriate choice of certificate in its additional input tape, and rejects any word not in the language regardless of the certificate. Descriptive complexity There is a simple logical characterization of NL: it contains precisely those languages expressible in first-order logic with an added transitive closure operator.  Closure properties  The class NL is closed under the operations complementation, union, and therefore intersection, concatenation, and Kleene star.

One of the main ideas of CIMOSA is the categorization of manufacturing operations in: * Generic functions: generic parts of every enterprise, independent of organisation structure or business area. * Specific (partial and particular) functions: specific for individual enterprises. The development of CIMOSA has ultimately resulted in two key items: * Modeling Framework: This framework supports \\"all phases of the CIM system life-cycle from requirements definition, through design specification, implementation description and execution of the daily enterprise operation\\". * Integrating Infrastructure: This infrastructure provides \\"specific information technology services for the execution of the Particular Implementation Model\\", which has proven to be vendor independent and portable. The framework furthermore offers an \\"event-driven, process-based modeling approach with the goal to cover essential enterprise aspects in one integrated model. The main aspects are the functional, behavioral, resource, information and organizational aspect\\". CIMOSA can be applied in process simulation and analysis.

Rego Park is bordered to the north by Elmhurst and Corona, to the east and south by Forest Hills, and to the west by Middle Village. Rego Park's boundaries include Queens Boulevard, the Long Island Expressway, Woodhaven Boulevard, and Yellowstone Boulevard. There is a large Jewish population in the neighborhood, which features high-rise apartment buildings and detached houses, as well as a large commercial zone. Rego Park is located in Queens Community District 6 and its ZIP Code is 11374. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 112th Precinct. Politically, Rego Park is represented by the New York City Council's 29th District and a small part of the 24th and 25th Districts.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History Rego Park is built on a swamp called the Hempstead Swamp, which once extended to St. John's Cemetery in Middle Village. By 1653, though, English and Dutch farmers moved into the area and founded a community called Whitepot, which was a part of the Township of Newtown. Whitepot is believed to be so named because the original Dutch settlers named the area \\"Whiteput\\", or \\"hollow creek\\"; later, English settlers Anglicized the name. The Remsen family created a burial ground, which is still located on Alderton Street near Metropolitan Avenue. The colonists also founded the Whitepot School, which operated until the late 19th century. In the Hempstead Swamp, which turned out to be good for farming, the colonists cultivated hay, straw, rye, corn, oats, and vegetables. The original Dutch, English, and German farmers sold their produce in Manhattan; by the end of the 19th century, though, Chinese farmers moved in and sold their goods exclusively to Chinatown. The settlement was renamed Rego Park after the Real Good Construction Company, which began development of the area in 1925. \\"Rego\\" comes from the first two letters of the first two words of the company's name. The company built 525 eight-room houses costing $8,000 each. Stores were built in 1926 on Queens Boulevard and 63rd Drive, and apartment buildings were built in 1927–1928. In 1930, the Independent Subway System began work on eight IND Queens Boulevard Line stations in the area, at a cost of $5 million. The subway extension was concurrent with the Real Good Construction Company's completion of apartment buildings near Queens Boulevard and one-family homes throughout the rest of the neighborhood. The short block of 63rd Drive between Austin Street and the Long Island Railroad overpass was the scene of a fire in February 1972 that claimed a row of stores and the neighborhood library. The blistering \\"Rego Park Inferno\\" reportedly started in the second store on the block from Austin Street, a shoe store, and quickly spread with the gusting winds to neighboring stores, including a television repair shop, toy store, pet shop and a pioneering Indian restaurant, and finally, the library, where row upon row of oily books and wooden shelves sent flames high into the sky and up the embankment of the railroad. Firefighters scrambled to keep the windswept flames from reaching an apartment house behind the stores, a new Key Food supermarket across Austin Street, or the Shell gas station just across the drive. The library caved in before flames could damage the electrical wires lining the railroad. A new library eventually opened across the street (on the former site of the Shell gas station). After the fire, until the new library was built, the community was served by a mobile \\"Bookmobile\\" library which parked under the LIRR tracks on 63rd Drive. A similar fire had decimated the same block in 1959. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Rego Park was 28,260, a decrease of 1,144 (3.9%) from the 29,404 counted in 2000.

The entirety of Community Board 6, which comprises Rego Park and Forest Hills, had 115,119 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.4 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged and elderly adults: 31% are between the ages of 25–44, 28% between 45–64, and 19% over 64. The ratio of young and college-aged residents was lower, at 16% and 5% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 4 was $75,447. In 2018, an estimated 26% of Rego Park and Forest Hills residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in seventeen residents (6%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 50% in Rego Park and Forest Hills, lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Rego Park and Forest Hills is considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. =Ethnic enclaves= Like its neighbor Forest Hills, Rego Park has long had a significant Jewish population, most of which have Georgian and Russian Jewish ancestors, with a number of synagogues and kosher restaurants. Many Holocaust survivors settled in Rego Park after 1945. In the 1990s, Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, especially from Central Asia, moved in. Most of the residents are Bukharan Jewish, and the effect of life in the Soviet Union on the population has led Rego Park to have a Russian feel with many signs in Russian Cyrillic. Most of the Bukharan Jewish immigrants in the neighborhood come from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and there is also Uzbek and Tajik cuisine in many Rego Park restaurants. Immigrant populations from Albania, Bosnia, Israel, Romania, Iran, Colombia, South Asia, China, Bulgaria, Peru, and South Korea are also represented in the neighborhood, as well as many restaurants and stores operated by people of different nationalities. In the 2000s and 2010s, many young professionals also moved in, and the average price of residential units in Rego Park increased correspondingly. Land use B.V.'s Pub =Housing= Many apartment buildings, multi-family, and railroad houses make up the north side of Rego Park. Apartment complexes include The Carol House, Savoy Gardens, Jupiter Court, The Brussels, and LeFrak City. However, many houses in southern Rego Park are in the colonial, English, and Tudor styles with slate roofs. There are also two and multi-family townhouses, detached wood-frame houses. This is especially so in an area called the Crescents, named for its semicircular shaped streets emanating in a concentric pattern from Alderton Street, between Woodhaven Boulevard and the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line. The Crescents contain many Tudor and single-family homes, as well as large lawns and tree plantings on the sidewalks. There are also many newer \\"Fedders houses\\", so called because these newer houses are all cheaply made and uniform-looking, with the names of the air conditioners (usually of the Fedders brand) sticking out of the walls. , Vornado Realty Trust is developing a 312-unit residential tower on top of Rego Center Phase II, to accommodate a surge in young professionals moving into the area. About 20% of the units are studio apartments, with the rest being one- and two- bedroom apartments. In addition, other new residential projects were also under construction around the neighborhood. =Commerce= Rego Center Phase I (August 2016) Local shops and national chains along Queens Blvd (August 2016) Rego Park is home to some of Queens' most popular shopping destinations, including the , 4-floor Rego Center. Phase I has a large Bed Bath & Beyond, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, and Old Navy locations, as well as a multilevel parking garage developed by Vornado Realty Trust. Phase II opened in 2010 with of retail space on 62nd Drive across from Rego Park Center. It houses Century 21, Costco, T.J. Maxx, Panera Bread, Lenora Furniture and Toy City, with more stores being built. Across the Long Island Expressway, in nearby Elmhurst, is the Queens Center Mall. Queens Center opened on September 12, 1973, on land previously occupied by Fairyland, a supermarket, and automobile parking. The mall doubled in size from 2002 to 2004. The first Trader Joe's in Queens opened in 2007 at 90–30 Metropolitan Avenue, in a building that also has a Staples and a Michaels, and is next to Bob's Discount Furniture, and Home Depot. The main business thoroughfare of Rego Park is 63rd Drive. The main section extends from Woodhaven Boulevard in the south, to Queens Boulevard in the north, with the central business district of Rego Park nestled between Alderton Street (just south of the Long Island Rail Road overpass), and Queens Boulevard. The stretch south of Alderton is entirely residential. The business district is anchored by The Rego Park School PS 139Q, an elementary school dating from 1928 and Our Saviour Lutheran Church established in 1926 which right across Wetherole Street from PS 139Q. The business district is criss-crossed by four side streets: Saunders, Booth, Wetherole, and Austin Streets. Most of the businesses lining 63rd Drive are the original single story \\"Taxpayers\\" dating from the 1930s. Across Queens Boulevard to the north, 63rd Drive becomes 63rd Road, and its business district continues another three blocks; 63rd Drive actually shifts one block south of 63rd Road. There are many small businesses in this area. Shopping districts with many smaller stores, bakeries, pharmacies and restaurants can be found along 108th Street as well. =Landmarks= Lost Battalion Hall The Lost Battalion Hall, on Queens Boulevard, is named after nine companies of the 77th Infantry Division who fought in World War I. Now a community center, the structure was erected in 1939 as a hall for Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion. It was taken over as a community center by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1960, and is still operated as such. While the VFW maintains its offices at the building, the American Legion left in 1962. The site also contains a play area and a New York City Department of Environmental Protection water pumping station. The Drake Theater, which opened in 1935 and closed in the 1990s, was used in the 1997 film Private Parts. The theater was damaged in December 1978 after around 500 people, complaining about the theater's sound system threw beer and liquor bottles at the screen and tearing holes in it, smashing seats and the candy counter with fire extinguishers from the walls, and breaking all the glass doors at the entrance. AT&T; Long Lines telephone exchange An AT&T; telephone building exists at Queens Boulevard and 62nd Drive. Our Saviour Lutheran Church, open since the 1920s, conducts its services in English and Chinese. The art deco Rego Park Jewish Center, opened in 1939, is notable for an A.

Accessed April 2, 2010. The Trylon Theater, an art deco theater built around the time of the 1939 New York World's Fair, was converted to the home of the Education Center for Russian Jewry in 2006. After local furor over interior refurbishment, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission was considering landmarking the property. The theater, which closed in 2009, was repurposed into a synagogue for more than a decade, but in 2013, the synagogue's congregation objected to their new landlord's planned eviction of the synagogue. Largely composed of Russian Jews, the congregation had attempted, but failed, to buy the building in 2012. =Notable roads= 63rd Drive in Rego Park (August 2016) * 63rd Road and Drive, the commercial artery of Rego Park, used to be Remsen’s Lane, which was named after the Remsen family who lived along the road. * The Crescents were originally composed of streets named Asquith, Boelsen, Cromwell, Dieterle, Elwell and Fitchett. These names were chosen when the Real Good Construction Company developed the area in the 1920s. * Horace Harding Expressway was once a turnpike called Nassau Boulevard and went from Elmhurst to Flushing, Bayside, and Little Neck. It was renamed for Horace J. Harding (1863–1929), a finance magnate who directed the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the New York Municipal Railways System; Harding encouraged city planner Robert Moses's system of parkways on New York, and after Harding died, the boulevard—and later, service road to the Long Island Expressway—was renamed after him. * Queens Boulevard, a wide at-grade highway that stretches from Long Island City to Jamaica, was formerly composed of two small dirt roads: Old Jamaica Road and Hoffman Boulevard. In the 1910s, it was paved and widened to 12 lanes. It is sometimes called the \\"Boulevard of Death\\" because of the high rate of pedestrian fatalities trying to cross the 12-lane boulevard. *Woodhaven Boulevard was known as Trotting Course Lane because it was named when horses were the main mode of transport. The lane dates back to the colonial days, and used to run along Whitepot's border Although it extends to Cross Bay Boulevard in the Rockaways, two small parts of the original lane still exist in Forest Hills. Yellowstone Boulevard was one of a few colonial roads in the area. It was named after the area's original name.

He completed over 40 wordless novels in his career, and among these, his greatest is generally said to be Passionate Journey. Masereel's woodcuts influenced Lynd Ward and later graphic artists such as Clifford Harper, Eric Drooker, and Otto Nückel. Biography =Upbringing= Frans Masereel was born in the Belgian coastal town Blankenberge on 31 July 1889, and at the age of five, his father died. His mother moved the family to Ghent in 1896. She met and married a physician with strong Socialist convictions, and the family together regularly protested against the appalling working conditions of the Ghent textile workers. =Education= At the age of 18 he began to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in the class of Jean Delvin. In 1909, he visited England and Germany, which inspired him to make his first etchings and woodcuts. In 1911 Masereel settled in Paris for four years and then emigrated to Switzerland, where he worked as a graphic artist for journals and magazines. Cornucopia, a mosaic by Frans Masereel =Emigre= Masereel could not return to Belgium at the end of World War I because, being a pacifist, he had refused to serve in the Belgian army. Nonetheless, when a circle of friends in Antwerp interested in art and literature decided to found the magazine Lumière, Masereel was one of the artists invited to illustrate the text and the column headings. The magazine was first published in Antwerp in August 1919.Joos Florquin, 'Ten huize van... 1', Davidsfonds, Leuven / Orion - Desclée De Brouwer, Bruges, 971, pp. 270–299 It was an artistic and literary journal published in French. The magazine's title Lumière was a reference to the French magazine Clarté, which was published in Paris by Henri Barbusse.Peter Brooker, Sascha Bru, Andrew Thacker, Christian Weikop, 'The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Europe 1880 - 1940', Oxford University Press, 19 May 2013, pp. 330–331 The principal artists who illustrated the text and the column headings in addition to Masereel himself were Jan Frans Cantré, Jozef Cantré, Henri van Straten, and Joris Minne. Together, they became known as 'De Vijf' or 'Les Cinq' ('The Five').Modernist wood cut prints of Joris Minne Lumière was a key force in generating renewed interest in wood engraving in Belgium. The five artists in the 'De Vijf' group were instrumental in popularizing the art of wood, copper and linoleum engraving and introducing Expressionism in early 20th-century Belgium.PASSINGS : Joris Minne; Belgian Helped Revive Art of Engraving, 2 April 1988, Los Angeles Times In 1921 Masereel returned to Paris, where he painted his famous street scenes, the Montmartre paintings. He lived for a time in Berlin, where his closest creative friend was George Grosz. After 1925 he lived near Boulogne-sur-Mer, where he painted predominantly coast areas, harbour views, and portraits of sailors and fishermen. During the 1930s his output declined. With the Fall of France to the Nazis in 1940 he fled from Paris and lived in several cities in Southern France. =Post-World-War 2= At the end of World War II Masereel was able to resume his artistic work and produced woodcuts and paintings. After 1946 he taught at the in Saarbrücken. In 1949 Masereel settled in Nice. Between 1949 and 1968, he published several series of woodcuts that differ from his earlier \\"novels in picture'\\" in comprising variations on a subject instead of a narrative. He also designed decorations and costumes for numerous theatre productions. The artist was honoured in numerous exhibitions and became a member of several academies. =Death= Frans Masereel died in Avignon in 1972 and was entombed in Ghent. Legacy =Influence= Masereel's woodcuts influenced Lynd Ward and later graphic artists such as George Walker, Clifford Harper, Eric Drooker, and New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno. Masereel's woodcut series, mainly of sociocritical content and expressionistic in form, made Masereel internationally known. Among them were the wordless novels 25 Images of a Man's Passion (1918), Passionate Journey (1919), The Sun (1919), The Idea (1920), Story Without Words (1920), and Landscapes and Voices (1929). At that time Masereel also drew illustrations for famous works of world literature by Thomas Mann, Émile Zola, and Stefan Zweig. He also produced a series of illustrations for the classic Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak by his fellow Belgian Charles De Coster; these illustrations followed the book in its translations to numerous languages.

The first of these arrived in 1763 after Spain traded Florida to Great Britain following the latter's victory over France in the Seven Years' War. Historical usage The term \\"cracker\\" was in use during the Elizabethan era to describe braggarts. The original root of this is the Middle English word crack, meaning \\"entertaining conversation\\" (as one may be said to \\"crack\\" a joke); this term and the Gaelicized spelling \\"craic\\" are still in use in Northern England. It is documented in William Shakespeare's King John Act II. Scene I. (1595): \\"What cracker is this same that deafs our ears/ With this abundance of superfluous breath?\\" By the 1760s, the ruling classes, both in Britain and in the American colonies, applied the term \\"cracker\\" to Scots- Irish and English American settlers of the remote southern back country, as noted in a letter to the Earl of Dartmouth: \\"I should explain to your Lordship what is meant by Crackers; a name they have got from being great boasters; they are a lawless set of rascalls on the frontiers of Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas, and Georgia, who often change their places of abode.\\"200 Quick Looks at Florida History By James C. Clark pg. 189 The word was later associated with the cowboys of Georgia and Florida, many of them descendants of those early frontier people who had migrated South. Also used by Florida cowboys, as with picture of Florida cracker Bone Mizell. Many of these original Florida ranchers preferred to be known as Cowmen, as their terrain and climate was significantly different from the well-known cowboys of the American West.https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl- xpm-2007-03-05-0703020312-story.html Cracker cowmen A Cracker Cowboy (1895) by Frederick Remington, depicting the cracker Morgan Bonaparte \\"Bone\\" Mizell. In Florida, those who own or work cattle traditionally have been called cowmen. In the late 1800s, they were often called cow hunters, a reference to hunting for cattle scattered over the wooded rangelands during roundups. At times the terms cowman and Cracker have been used interchangeably because of similarities in their folk culture. Today the western term \\"cowboy\\" is often used for those who work cattle. The Florida \\"cowhunter\\" or \\"cracker cowboy\\" of the 19th and early 20th centuries was distinct from the Spanish vaquero and the Western cowboy. Florida cowboys did not use lassos to herd or capture cattle. Their primary tools were cow whips and dogs. The Florida Cracker horses (cracker ponies) was smaller than western breeds as was the Florida Cracker cattle, also known as the \\"native\\" or \\"scrub\\" cows, who averaged about and had large horns and large feet. Another version of the origin for the term \\"cracker\\" was that while rounding up cattle the cowmen used long, braided leather bullwhips to get the cattle out from the brush or while on drives. They would flail the whips creating a cracking sound and they became known as “crackers”. The cowmen annually drove cattle over the Florida Cracker Trail from Fort Pierce (Florida's east coast) to Bradenton (Florida's west coast) so they could be shipped to Cuba. During the American Civil War Florida’s cattle were a chief source of meat, leather and hides for the Confederate States Army. Florida crackers were recruited into the “Cow Cavalry” to make cattle drives to Georgia and to protect them from Union attacks. The Florida crackers were made more famous by Frederic Remington's artwork and his 1895 Harper's New Monthly Magazine article about the cowmen. Modern usage Among some Floridians, the term is used as a proud or jocular self-description. Since the huge influx of new residents into Florida in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, from the northern parts of the United States and from Mexico and Latin America, the term \\"Florida Cracker\\" is used informally by some Floridians to indicate that their families have lived in the state for many generations. It is considered a source of pride to be descended from \\"frontier people who did not just live but flourished in a time before air conditioning, mosquito repellent, and screens.\\" The portion of the Gulf of Mexico that touches the western Florida coast is referred to as Cracker Bay . Florida's west coast, Cracker Bay aka Bay of Cracker Cracker Storytelling Festival Since the late 20th century, the Cracker Storytelling Festival has been held annually in the fall at Homeland Heritage Park in Homeland, Florida. The year 2013 marked the 25th anniversary of the festival. The Cracker Storytelling Festival includes many storytellers from around Florida who come to share their stories with visitors. The majority of visitors who attend this event are students, because storytelling is part of the Florida curriculum. The festival also incorporates local crafts and artwork, food vendors and a cracker whip-cracking contest. During the cracker whip-cracking contest, participants compete to see who can crack the most buttery flaky crackers.

Early life Maunsell was born in 1884 in Srinagar, Kashmir in British India, one of three children of a military family. His father, Edward Henry Maunsell (1837–1913) was of Anglo-Irish descent, and was a captain in the 5th Dragoon Guards and 15th Hussars. His mother, Rosalie Harriet Anson (1852–1922), was born in Guernsey; the couple had married in Bombay Cathedral in 1878. He was distantly related to General Sir Frederick Richard Maunsell (1828–1916) of the Royal Bengal Engineers. Young Guy was sent to school in England at Eastbourne College between 1897 and 1903, and studied civil engineering at the Central Institution of the City & Guilds of London Institute, South Kensington. Although he graduated with first class honours in 1906, he did not find immediate employment and travelled the country making watercolour paintings. The following year, he became an assistant to Swiss engineer Adrien Palaz (1863–1930), professor of Industrial Electricity at the University of Lausanne, where he learned the latest techniques associated with reinforced concrete. In 1909 he secured a post at Easton Gibb & Son who were engaged in the construction of the Rosyth Dockyard.Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell: Early life and career In July 1914, Maunsell moved to R. Thorburn and Sons as their chief agent and was responsible for building two TNT factories for the British Government. World War I In 1917, Maunsell was conscripted as a commissioned officer in the Royal Engineers and spent a year on the Western Front. Recalled to England, he worked as chief engineer at John Ver Mehr's yard in Shoreham, in the construction of concrete tugs and barges called the Shoreham Creteships. He was also involved in the concrete and steel towers for the Admiralty M-N Scheme, which were intended to close the Strait of Dover to U-boats. A single tower survived today as the Nab Tower lighthouse.Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell: World War I and post-war wanderings In 1955 he founded the firm of G Maunsell & Partners in the United Kingdom which pioneered the use of prestressed concrete in major bridges. The Hammersmith Flyover, completed in 1961, made revolutionary use of this new construction method and many more structures followed. The firm expanded to Australia, Hong Kong and the Middle East and in time merged with Oscar Faber & Partners to form Faber Maunsell, and ultimately became part of the US-based AECOM Group. Maunsell is best known for his innovative, practical maritime engineering and pioneering the development of prestressed concrete in the UK, Australia and Hong Kong. His view was always that the interests of a client would be best served by an integrated approach to design and construction. He died at Tunbridge Wells, Kent on 20th June 1961.findagrave.com References External links *Pictures of the Sea Forts designed by Maunsell * Article on the Sea Forts *Maunsell Army Sea Forts *Maunsell Sea Forts *Maunsell  AECOM Category:1884 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Irish civil engineers Category:Reinforced concrete ","title":"Guy Maunsell"},{"id":"1146018","text":"Eye for Eye (1987) is a science fiction novella by Orson Scott Card. It first appeared in the March 1987 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction magazine. In 1990 it appeared in Card's short story collection Maps in a Mirror and also as a Tor double novel, with The Tunesmith by Lloyd Biggle, Jr.. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1988. Plot summary Mick Winger has an unusual gift and with it has accidentally killed several people. When Mick gets angry at people, his power manifests itself by launching an attack upon them by giving them cancer, leukemia or related terminal illnesses. If made angry enough, his anger can outright kill the victim. Mick was raised in an orphanage and along his journey to manhood unintentionally killed several people who mistreated him, as well as nearly everyone he loved, though nearly every occurrence was accidental. The only intentional murder he describes while growing up is being nearly molested in a Denny's bathroom. This is when he discovers the intensity of the attacks are greatly heightened when he's touching a target. When fifteen, he fled child custody and set out on his own. When Mick becomes angry, he gets, as he describes it, \\"sparky.\\" He can see sparks surrounding and enveloping him and then those sparks lashing out on the object of his anger. Unavoidably, those attacked by his \\"sparks\\" end up with terminal illnesses and soon die. The effect of his attack is much more pronounced if he is touching the victim. Until he was a young man, Mick had no idea he was different from other children. He discovered he was different when describing \\"sparkiness\\" with other children, who had no idea what he was talking about. Soon after setting out on his own, he encounters a young woman who not only knows about his gift, but who even seems to possess the same gift, although to a lesser extent. She however possesses the ability to \\"call,\\" to influence Mick so that he unintentionally heads straight for her, as well as intense sexual attraction, which she describes as simple pheromones that all people have, except that people like Mick, due to a different biochemical makeup (though Mick doesn't understand this when it is first explained to him), is far more susceptible to these pheromones than a normal human being. Eventually he is led back to his birth parents, who are members of a mysterious, secluded colony. Talking to his parents, who also possess his ability, he learns he is far more powerful than they or probably anyone else at the colony. Mick learns that what he sees as \\"sparks\\" his family only sees as dust; he even begins to realize that he can see when people are lying. After being brought to the villages Patriarch, Papa Lem, Mick learns the intent of the colony and how they operate. Mick then refuses to \\"spread his seed\\" with the daughter of Papa Lem and returns to his parents' house for the night. During the night, Mick is attacked by an agent of Papa Lem and others from the village. Mick ends up killing his father and setting fire to the village while at the same time learning new extents to his abilities. After fleeing the village on foot, Mick runs into the girl he met when he first set out on his own. The assailants from the village quickly catch up with the duo and start firing at them. The woman, unbeknown to Mick, is shot in the back of the head just as they reach their allies. Mick pulls the girl from her wrecked car and puts all his \\"sparkiness\\" into her just before passing out. Mick awakes in the lair of his new allies. Upon questioning, Mick learns that the girl is alive and that he had somehow healed her from the bullet wound. Mick is on his way to officially meet the young lady when the story abruptly ends.

Selection and Training  Hellanodikai were handpicked from people living in the region of Elis, as Elis was responsible for the running of the Olympics. Originally the post was hereditary, but this was changed, and an Elean from each of the ruling families were elected as a Hellanodikas. Their post only lasted for one Olympiad, and elections took place for each of the subsequent games. In the ten months preceding the games, the Hellanodikai lived in a specially made building in Elis, called the Hellanodikaion. This building was close to the gymnasiums where the athletes trained in preparation for the games. While staying at the Hellanodikaion, they were trained by the nomophylakes (νομοφύλακες, meaning 'guardians of the law') in the rules and regulations of the olympic games.  Function  = Judgement = The Hellanodikai were renowned for their fairness, and the public held them in high regard. While bribery and cheating among the athletes was commonplace, there was only one recorded case of corruption among the judges, where a Hellanodikas won two equestrian events. To remain impartial, the Hellanodikai were no longer allowed to participate in the games, and this remained the only blemish on their otherwise impeccable record. Another task for the Hellanodikai was to supervise the training of the athletes, where they selected those who were well trained, rejecting those who were not performing at a satisfactory level. The trainers for the individual athletes had to be present, but could not intervene or they were punished accordingly. They evaluated each athlete on behaviour, character and morality, as well as the more standard attributes such as power, stamina, and resistance. Those that were approved were entered into a special list called the leukoma (λεύκωμα). = Ritual = Besides being judges and umpires, the Hellanodikai also were the general organisers, and were present at every ceremony and event that took place, having the honour of presenting the crowns and palm branches to the winners. They were also expected to police the games. Two days before the games, the athletes which were eligible left Elis for Olympia, in a procession led by the Hellanodikai.

It forms part of two major rings of mountains, surrounding the valleys of Great Langdale and Upper Eskdale. The name reflects the fell's physical appearance as its summit ridge is a series of five rises and depressions (crinkles) that are very distinctive from the valley floor. In Old English, cringol means twisted or wrinkled. Topography The nomenclature of the various tops is very confused. Traditional guidebooks tend to rely on what the eye sees and therefore focus attention upon the five ‘crinkles’ of the summit ridge. These are generally referred to as the first to fifth crinkles, but RichardsRichards, Mark: Mid-Western Fells: Collins (2004): starts in the north, BirkettBirkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): in the south and WainwrightAlfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 4: employs both conventions, depending upon the direction of travel. For clarity in this article the first crinkle will be taken as the southernmost top. On this basis, the second Crinkle (also called Long Top) is the true summit of the fell. The only other Crinkle with a definitive name is Gunson Knott, the fifth. To the north of the Crinkles proper is a depression and then the outcropping continues over Shelter Crags. In recent times more systematic hill lists have been produced based upon topographical prominence and height, rather than mere visual appeal. Most relevant to Crinkle Crags are the lists of Hewitts and Nuttalls. These variously list the summit, the first Crinkle (Crinkle Crags South Top), and two tops on Shelter Crags (Shelter Crags and Shelter Crags North Top), but exclude the other three Crinkles.Nuttall, John & Anne: The Mountains of England and Wales: Cicerone: The ridge of Crinkle Crags extends due south from its higher neighbour, Bowfell. Between the two is the col of Three Tarns, named for the small pools in the depression. Depending upon recent rainfall there may be anything from two to five tarns in evidence on the ground. From here the rocky outcropping of Shelter Crags is quickly reached. Beyond the summit to the south, the ridge descends over Stonesty Pike and Little Stand (a Nuttall) to the Duddon Valley at Cockley Beck. Two further ridges branch out from Crinkle Crags on either side of the summit, before turning south to run parallel to Little Stand. On the west, across the marshy trench of Moasdale is Hard Knott. To the east an initially indistinct ridge firms up on the traverse to Cold Pike. Between Cold Pike and Crinkle Crags, but generally included as part of the latter is the further Nuttall of Great Knott. Ascents In his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Alfred Wainwright describes Crinkle Crags as :Much too good to be missed ... this is a climb deserving of high priority. There are a variety of routes directly to the summit: most people climb the fell from Great Langdale and usually together with all or some of the adjoining fells of Bowfell, Pike of Blisco, Rossett Pike and Cold Pike to make a high-level ridge walk which encompasses the whole of the high ground at the head of Great Langdale. The ascent from Eskdale is very good, but that is at least a 15-kilometre (9-mile) round trip (depending on where in Eskdale one starts), and many people will think that this too far to \\"bag\\" just one fell. The shortest and quickest route requires the use of a car to the top of the Wrynose Pass motor road. Summit The traverse of the summit ridge with its series of undulations is an exhilarating experience for the fell walker. The ridge includes the so-called \\"Bad Step\\", a steep declivity which catches out many walkers when travelling from north to south; however, the obstacle can be by-passed without too much trouble. The view from the summit is very good: there are airy views of Great Langdale, Eskdale and Dunnerdale, with the estuaries of the rivers Duddon and Esk well seen as they enter the Irish Sea. There is a very good view of England's highest mountain, Scafell Pike, which lies just four kilometres (2½ miles) away to the north west. Shelter Crags gives extensive all-round views.

Voodoo Glow Skulls first played at backyard parties and later at Spanky's Café in their hometown of Riverside, where they played shows with the Angry Samoans, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Firehose, Murphy's Law, and The Dickies. History Their first recording was in 1989 a four-song demo on a four-track machine which they duplicated onto about sixty cassettes on a home stereo then sold at shows. In 1990, Voodoo Glow Skulls released their first 7\\" EP The Old of Tomorrow, a parody title inspired by the straight edge band named Youth of Today, with the help of local band Public Humiliation, and also booked their own DIY US tour. In 1991, the band added a horn section to their live shows and recordings, due mostly to the influence of two of their favorite bands at the time, Fishbone and Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band's second independent release came out in 1992 with the Rasta Mis Huevos 7\\" EP for Signal Sound Systems Records. This label also released a glow-in-the-dark 12\\" EP titled We're Coloring Fun and the first release of The Potty Training Years on CD. Voodoo Glow Skulls recorded their debut album Who Is, This Is? for Dr. Strange Records in 1993, gaining the attention of Brett Gurewitz, owner of Epitaph Records.The band then signed to Epitaph Records and released a further four albums. The band began to tour worldwide with their first European tour in 1996 followed by Japan, Australia, Mexico, and South America. The band has been featured on several of Epitaph's Punk-O-Rama releases and has had music featured in video games, TV and movies. The song \\"Shoot the Moon\\" from the band's Firme album was used in the Pauly Shore movie Bio-Dome and the band's version of \\"Used to Love Her\\" (originally written and recorded by Guns N' Roses) is featured in the Mr. & Mrs. Smith soundtrack. In 2002, Voodoo Glow Skulls signed to Victory Records. The band released three albums on the Victory label and continued to tour. On January 18, 2012, the band released its self-produced ninth album, Break the Spell, through Smelvis Records. The band contributed a song to the 2015 Rancid tribute compilation, Hooligans United. The band appeared as musical guests during the second season of Lucha Underground in 2016. On June 3, 2017, Frank Casillas announced his retirement from Voodoo Glow Skulls. The band has continued playing with Efrem Schulz from Death by Stereo on vocals. In 2017, trumpet player Mark Bush left the band to play for The Mad Caddies. Trombonist Dan Albert also stopped touring with the band around this time, but still appears live with Buck-O-Nine. Jose Pazsoldan has since taken over on trombone, and former saxophonist Eric Fazzini returned to the stage to play saxophone with the band.

Construction and active service Carp (SS-338) was launched 12 November 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. W. E. Hess; and commissioned 28 February 1945, Lieutenant Commander J. L. Hunnicutt, USNR, in command. Carp departed New London 14 April 1945, conducted training at Balboa, Panama, and arrived at Pearl Harbor 21 May. On her first and only war patrol (8 June – 7 August), Carp cruised off the coast of Honshū, destroying small craft and patrolling for the carriers of the 3rd Fleet engaged in air strikes on the mainland. Undergoing refit at Midway when hostilities ended, Carp returned to Seattle 22 September. Carp received one battle star for her service in World War II. Her single war patrol was designated as \\"successful\\". Based in San Diego as flagship for Submarine Division 71, Carp operated along the West Coast with occasional training cruises to Pearl Harbor. Between 13 February and 15 June 1947 she made a simulated war patrol to the Far East, and in 1948 and 1949 Carp made two exploratory cruises to extreme northern waters, adding to the knowledge of an increasingly important strategic area for submarine operations. Converted to a Fleet Snorkel-type submarine in February 1952, which added to her submerged speed and endurance, Carp supported United Nations' forces in the Korean War during her cruise of 22 September 1952–April 1953 to the Far East. Arriving at Pearl Harbor, her new home port 15 March 1954, Carp remained on active duty with the fleet from that port through July 1959. During this time she continued to make cruises to the Far East, one of which included a good-will visit to Australia and participation in a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization exercise, and to Alaskan waters. On 1 August 1959 Carp departed Pearl Harbor for her new assignment with the Atlantic Fleet. Arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, 28 August 1959, the submarine conducted type exercises and training off the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea through 1967. Auxiliary and training service Carp was redesignated an Auxiliary Submarine, AGSS-338, in 1968, and Miscellaneous Submarine IXSS-338 in 1971. Around 1971, Carp was moored at South Boston Naval Annex, across the harbor from Logan International Airport at about the point where Interstate 90 now crosses. She was used for training. Her battery room was converted into a television lounge, and her rudder was welded in place; otherwise, Carp seemed fully operational to trainees. Fate She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 December 1971 and sold for scrapping in 1973. Her conning tower has been preserved at Seawolf Park on Pelican Island just north of Galveston, Texas.

During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were used by only a small minority of makes, it was usually known simply as the Ford V‑8, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the \\"Ford V‑8\\", after its new engine. Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time. It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments.. A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973. The engine was intended to be used for big passenger cars and trucks;. p 214 it was installed in such (with minor, incremental changes). until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market. The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century. It was a staple of hot rodders in the 1950s, and it remains famous in the classic car hobbies even today, despite the huge variety of other popular V8s that followed. Development and production overview Before this engine's introduction, almost all mass-produced cars affordable to the \\"average mass- market consumer\\" (which was a concept that Ford helped invent) used inline- four and inline-six cylinder engines. Since French engineer Léon Levavasseur's invention of the V8 engine in 1902, multi-cylinder V-engines (V8s, V12s, and even V16s) were produced, but were used in luxury models and their production runs were thus limited (relative to downmarket production volumes).. For example, the first Cadillac V8 engine was in that category. Even though Ford had an engineering team assigned to develop the engine, many of the ideas and innovations were Henry Ford's. The Model A, its variants (B and 18), and this V8 engine were developed between 1926 and 1932, and this period was the elder Ford's last central contribution to the company's engineering. Mercury's version was introduced in 1939.Shelton, p.20. Aftermarket heads were available from Barney Navarro,Shelton, p.20 caption. Vic Edelbrock, and Offenhauser. An economizing design feature of this engine was the use of three main bearings to support the crankshaft, rather than the customary five bearings used with most V-8s. The flathead mounted the camshaft above the crankshaft, like later pushrod-operated overhead-valve engines. Valves for each bank were mounted inside the triangular area formed by the \\"vee\\" of cylinders. The intake manifold fed both banks from inside the vee, but the exhaust ports had to pass between the cylinders to reach the outboard exhaust manifolds. Such an arrangement transferred exhaust heat to the block, imposing a large cooling load; it required far more coolant and radiator capacity than equivalent overhead-valve V8 engines. Ford flathead V8s were notorious for cracking blocks if their barely adequate cooling systems were overtaxed (such as in trucking or racing). The simple design left much room for improvement, and the power available after even low cost modifications was usually substantially more than could be obtained from an overhead-valve inline six-cylinder engine of similar displacement. The Ford flathead V8 was licensed to other producers. It was used by Simca in France until 1961 and in Brazil until 1964 for cars and until 1990 in the Simca Unic Marmon Bocquet military truck. In the United States, the flathead V8 was replaced by the more modern overhead-valve Ford Y-block engine in 1954. Components =Crankshaft= The crankshaft development for the Ford flathead V8 was pioneering. The engine's production development program began with a forged steel crank, per conventional practice, but Ford then developed the improved foundry practice, heat- treating, and materials handling logistics to make the cranks from cast steel instead, yielding in the end a crank just as strong, but less expensive to produce.. These new methods were patented. The simple three-main-bearing crankshaft attached two connecting rods to a single crankpin, one rod from each cylinder bank. As with other crankshafts, static and dynamic balancing was performed (as this video on the Ford flathead V8 shows). The short crankshaft proved quite durable in comparison to six-cylinder engines when roughly handled. For these reasons, the flathead Ford became a favorite among hot-rodders, and this in turn led to a rich supply of aftermarket performance parts. With the use of specialized pistons or connecting rods the stroke of the crankshaft could be increased by welding and regrinding as a method of increasing engine displacement, usually in combination with overboring as described below. The sought-after crankshaft by hot rodders is the stroke Mercury version. It can be identified by the four diameter clean-out plugs, two in the front of the front rod throws and two in the back of the back two rod throws of the crankshaft. They measure on the Mercury crankshaft and on the Ford crankshaft, usually. The French military cranks, at least sometimes, had the plugs in the stroke cranks. The crankshafts came in the 1949 to 1953 engines. =Block= Engine block of a flathead V8 showing the location of the valve ports (the holes above the large cylinder bores) One of the most important innovations in the Ford flathead V8 was the casting of the crankcase and all 8 cylinders in one engine block. This level of monobloc design for V-8 blocks had been accomplished before, but it had never seen mass production. Making it practical for the latter was an example of the production development needed to bring a V8 engine to the widely affordable segment of the market. Most V engines of the time had multiple cylinder blocks bolted to a common crankcase (itself a separate casting). At most, each bank of the V was an integral block, but many V engines had 4- or even 6-cylinder blocks, with cylinders cast in pairs or triples. Like most other engine blocks then and now, it was cast iron; but the foundry practice (e.g., workflows, materials handling) was a revolutionary advancement in the mass production of castings.. Charles E. Sorensen lived up to his longtime nickname at Ford, \\"Cast-Iron Charlie\\", by leading this revolution to bring Ford's first V8 to market. As with any V8, the block was relatively light for the displacement supported. The cooling jacket reaches down to the bottom dead centre, which is unusually low. American engineers at the time believed this would improve the piston cooling.. p 215 The bottom of the block formed the parting line for the main bearing caps. The most complex part of the block was the exhaust passage routing. The exhaust valves were on the inside of the V and exhaust flow was initially downward and passed around the cylinders through the water jacket to exit on the outside of the cylinder block. The routing of the exhaust through the water jacket put an extremely heavy load on the cooling system and led to frequent overheating, especially on early models, if the cooling system was not maintained. Somewhat primitive water pumps used until the advent of the 1948 8RT and 1949 8BA models also contributed to the overheating problem. The space for the exhaust flow was also somewhat restricted, so the exhaust passages were tall and narrow in some locations. The gas flow past the rough sand castings could be greatly improved by polishing the passages. The capacity of the block for over-boring (beyond normal boring for wear compensation) was limited by the configuration and the metal available. In early blocks, some cylinder walls were extremely thin due to cores shifting during casting. It was prudent to overbore before relieving and polishing the ports, as a casting flaw such as a sand pit might be revealed, usually fatal to further use of the block. The blocks with the factory bore can usually be safely bored over standard to and sometimes can be bored over standard to , increasing displacement a little over 12%. =Bearings= The engines built from 1932 to 1935 had poured main bearings which required skill and machine shop equipment to overhaul. Part of the 1936 production and all production from 1937 to the end of flathead V8 production had both replaceable shell main bearings and connecting rod inserts (unlike the contemporary GM products), enabling straightforward and low cost rebuilding, another reason why the Ford was a favorite of amateur mechanics. These shell main bearings are made of a cadmium silver alloy. = Camshaft and timing = The Ford flathead V8 has a single camshaft located inside the engine block above the crankshaft. It is spur gear driven; the camshaft's spur gear is made of plastic. The camshaft has three camshaft bearings. A lid made of cast iron covers the camshaft spur gears; the ignition distributor is placed on top of this lid and is driven by the camshaft spur gears. For powering the fuel pump, the camshaft is fitted with an extra cam located in the bearing on the flywheel side. =Lubrication= Also unlike the Chevrolet inline 6, Ford products used high oil pressure for lubrication for the main and rod bearings, as do all modern vehicle combustion engines. This offered a significant performance advantage, as full pressure lubrication allowed for continuous use above 3500 rpm and not starve the rod bearings for oil, which was necessary for high performance applications, such as racing. For this reason, bank robber Clyde Barrow preferred to steal Fords as getaway vehicles. It also eliminated a complex oil jet system to feed the rod bearings in the oil pan. As a side benefit to a prospective purchaser of a used vehicle, this also enabled the condition of the connecting rod and main bearings to be determined indirectly by observation of the analog oil pressure gauge after the vehicle was warmed up, provided that oil of normal viscosity was in use. =Exhaust= The exhaust outlets in the 1932-48 cars and the 1932-47 trucks were near the front of the manifolds aiming down and sometimes out. A Y-pipe took the exhaust gases to the right side of the vehicle to a single muffler, then to a single pipe out the back on the right side. The left side exhaust manifold exhausted to the front in the 1949–53 Ford cars, where a crossover pipe took the exhaust to the forward end of the right side manifold on the car engines and between the 1st and second cylinder on some trucks, in turn exhausting to a single pipe at the rear. A common conversion for the 1949-53 Ford cars and 1952-53 Mercurys was to block off the right forward manifold entrance and route the left side exhaust to a new pipe to form a dual exhaust system with better flow characteristics. These typically involved installation of free-flowing mufflers, which if at a legal noise level still allowed low frequency sounds to pass, giving a characteristic rumbling dual exhaust sound to these systems. In the 1950s shortcut exhaust outlets with manually removed covers were added to street machines in emulation of vehicles intended for high speed straight line racing on dry lake beds, typically located just behind the front wheel, although chromed external runners sometimes extended to just forward of the rear wheel. These covers were referred to as lake plugs, the pipes as lake pipes. This style exhaust was also used legally in sanctioned drag racing and illegally in unsanctioned performance demonstrations. =Internal Air flow= More extreme modifications were to improve the airflow by removing material from the top of the block between the valves and the cylinders (called relieving), increasing the size of the inlet and exhaust passages (called porting), and by polishing the sand-cast surfaces to improve air flow. Increased compression ratios could be cheaply obtained by milling material from the head or by obtaining aluminum heads as aftermarket parts. Higher capacity intake manifolds were similarly available. Changing the camshaft to a higher performance version required head removal so that the valves could be held up out of the way, so this was usually done only as part of a substantial rework of the basic engine. =Overhead-valve kits= A popular modification for the flathead was conversion to an overhead-valve configuration, and many such modification kits were available, including the Ardun headsAnnouncing the Reintroduction of the ARDUN OHV Cylinder Head. ardun.com, 1 July 2008 from Zora Arkus-Duntov who was to go on to fame as the \\"father of the Corvette\\". These conversions were not initially demanded by hot rodders looking for extra power, as they had not yet exhausted the capabilities of the flathead configuration, but were demanded by users of the engine in trucks and other such high load applications, where the constant flow of hot exhaust through the block to the exhaust manifolds caused the entire engine to overheat; the overhead-valve heads routed the exhaust out more directly, and away from the block. Hot-rodding applications In the early 1950s, many hot-rodders could not afford to purchase and modify even a \\"cheap\\" flathead V-8, and a large investment in machine work and aftermarket parts was necessary to bring a Ford flathead V-8 to even the performance levels of most stock OHV V-8s available at the time. Even many inline six-cylinder engines from that period could be modified to produce more reliable and practical power than Ford V-8s, as the Ford flathead V-8 is saddled with many design features that make modifying it for true high-performance use difficult and expensive compared with other V-8s. As modern OHV V-8s became available and affordable in salvage yards, the Ford flathead V-8 rapidly disappeared from the hot-rodding scene. Hot-rodding in general moved away from the salvage-yard car builds as parts and labor became more expensive and many hot-rod shops priced themselves out of business. The modern OHV V-8 powered vehicles available also contributed to the demise of hot-rodding's original culture (affordable modifications by working-class car owners), as new factory cars became capable of much higher performance than most hot-rods. Today the flat-head Ford is mainly used in \\"retro\\" hot-rod builds by builders more interested in a retro vibe and recreating history than performance. Even 4-cylinder Ford engines are used to make a retro hot-rod \\"correct\\". Ford flathead V-8 with an aftermarket twin plug cylinder head & Stromberg carburettors =Modern performance flatheads= Ford flatheads are still hot rodded today, with a special land speed record class for flathead engines. The current record holder achieves and .\\"Flatfire Racer Sets 300 Miles per Hour Record at Bonneville Salt Flats 2004 Using 1946 Ford Flathead Engine; Ron Main Speed Ace on Land.\\" bluebird-electric.net, 7 October 2006. On one pass the car broke but did not set a record. Two passes have to be made in order to break the record. Tractor conversions During the 1930s to 1950s, the farm market in North America and parts of Europe demanded ever-increasing power output from farm tractors. It was in this climate that Ford experimented with V-8 tractor designs, some individual farmers converted their 4-cylinder tractors to Ford inline-6 or V-8 engines, and a few aftermarket companies offered such conversions for sale. Among the latter, the best-known were Funk conversions by brothers Joe and Howard Funk. In the 1930s, the Funk brothers built aircraft—including the Funk B, which used an engine design based on Ford engines. In the late 1940s, their aircraft line became unprofitable, but they found renewed profitability in aftermarket parts for tractors—transmissions, engines, and accessories. They sold many converted Ford N-Series tractors and conversion kits using Ford industrial inline-6 engines and Ford flathead V-8 engines. Version types Flathead V8 in a 1937 Ford coupé Types are classified by their displacement. =221= The original flathead engine displaced , with bore and stroke.Street Rodder, 1/85, p. 73 The block was cast as a single piece (monobloc) for durability, and a single-barrel carburetor fed the engine. The 1932 V8-18 with 5.5:1 compression produced . The 1933-34 V8-40 raised compression to 6.33:1 and power to . In 1934 a two barrel down draft carburetor was introduced. 1935's V8-48 saw compression drop to 6.3:1, but power climb to , and torque was rated at . It became the V8-68 in 1936, with compression, horsepower, and torque unchanged. Production of the original 221 lasted from 1932 through to 1936. These engines can be identified by having the water pumps located at the front of the heads. A similar 221 flathead was used in Fords for 1937 and 1938 but the block was revised to have the water pumps mounted on the block. The new design also relocated the water outlet from the front of the heads to the top center of the heads. These, designated V8-78, were offered with standard 6.2:1 compression aluminum or 7.5:1 compression iron cylinder heads, rated at and (aluminum) or (iron). The 1932 through 1938 motors used twenty one studs to hold down each head and are known as \\"21 stud\\" motors. This motor continued to be made into the 1950s in Europe. In late 1938 Ford introduced V8-81A, commonly called the \\"24 stud\\" engine because it uses twenty four studs to hold down each head. This engine debuted at the same time as the 239 motor. With 6.12:1 compression, horsepower remained the same, but torque increased by . In 1939, as the V8-91A, compression increased to 6.15:1, power rose to , and torque reached ; the ratings remained the same for the 1940 V8-01A, 1941 V8-11A, and the last civilian model, the V8-21A, which saw compression rise, to 6.2:1. This engine was used through 1942 for civilian use and saw some use in military vehicles during World War Two. Collectively all 221 motors are commonly referred to as \\"85 horse\\" motors. =239= Ford Crestline Sunliner Ford introduced the V8-99A engine with bore and stroke and 6.15:1 compression in 1939. It produced and . This was done to provide a more powerful engine for the Mercury cars, which Ford Motor Company started making in 1939. It was used in Mercurys in 1939 and in Fords in 1946. This engine is very similar to the late 221 engine. As the V8-09A in 1940, compression, power, and torque were unchanged; in 1941, the V8-19A compression and power were static, but torque rose by , while the 1942 V8-29A increased compression to 6.4:1 and power to , while torque stayed the same. Postwar, it became the V8-69 (suffixed \\"A\\" in Fords, \\"M\\" in Mercurys), with compression 6.75:1, , and . For 1947 and 1948, only the designation changed, to V8-79 and -89. The 239 was redesigned in 1948 as the 8RT for Ford trucks and in 1949 as the 8BA for the cars. It had higher 6.8:1 compression, but performance was unchanged. The 1950 V8-0BA boosted torque by , the 1951 -1BA by more, while in 1952, as the V8-B2, compression climbed to 7.2:1, power to , and torque to , then to in the -B3 of 1953, its final year. The 1948 to 1953 engines have a revised cooling and ignition system. Collectively all 239 engines are referred to as \\"100 horse\\" engines, although the horsepower was increased in 1952 to 110 horsepower in cars and 106 horsepower in trucks. This engine was used in Ford's transit buses during the most productive years of the company's short stint in the transit bus business from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s, most notably in the 1939-1947 version of the Ford Transit Bus. The latest iteration of this engine was used from 1948 to 1953 in the U.S and till 1954 in Canada. It was initially designated the 8BA (see above) in automobiles and the 8RT in trucks. 8RT remained the truck engine designation throughout the entire run from 1948 through 1953 in the U.S (1954 in Canada). The engines were essentially identical. Earlier Ford V8s had the unique Ford designed distributor driven directly from the forward end of the camshaft, which was an inconvenient location for maintenance. This final flathead used a more conventional distributor driven at a right angle to the crankshaft and located at the right front of the engine where it was readily accessible. The water inlets and thermostat housings were moved to the front end of the heads, and the 24 studs and nuts that attached the heads on the old engine were replaced by 24 bolts. =136= The 144ci Aquilon engine used by Ford France and later Simca A V8-74 version was introduced in the United States in 1937. With bore and stroke and 6.6:1 compression, the engine was rated and . The designation changed again in 1939, to V8-922A, but the specifications remained the same. It was produced in Europe in 1935 and 1936, and was used in the many standard Ford vehicles based on the car platform of the era. It was not very popular with U.S. buyers who were used to the cars. Redesignated V8-82A in 1938, V8-922A in 1939, and V8-022A in 1940, compression, power, and torque remained unchanged. The engine was very popular as a powerplant for midget race cars after World War II. This engine is most commonly referred to as the \\"60 horse\\" flathead, or the V8-60. It was replaced by the 226 straight-6 in the 1941 Fords, though it would continue to be used after the war in the French Ford Vedette and the British Ford Pilot. In 1952 Ford France (who called this engine the Aquilon) created a somewhat bored out version displacing . Production was taken over by Simca in 1954 who began installing it in their Simca Vedette in 1955. Simca then transferred the Aquilon production line to Simca do Brasil, where it was kept in production until 1969 (the company was known as Chrysler Brazil from July 1967). Simca do Brasil introduced a version in May 1962 but the real surprise was the \\"Emi-Sul\\" of April 1966. This engine has overhead valves and hemispherical combustion chambers; it produced in its most powerful version. =255= The 1948-1953 , referred to as the model BG, was achieved by use of a stroke crankshaft in the 8BA/8RT engine. It was only used in Mercury cars, and heavy service trucks. Known as the V8-9CM in 1949, it featured 6.8:1 compression, , and torque, which stayed the same for the 1950 V8-0CM. The 1951 V8-1CM raised this by , and torque, The 1952 V8-MA boosted compression to 7.2:1, power to , and torque to , while only the name changed, dropping the -MA, for the last year of production, 1953. Because of interchangeability, the Mercury crank made a popular upgrade in the 239 among hot rodders. In fact, in the 1950s, the flathead block was often fitted with crankshafts of up to stroke.Street Rodder, 1/85, p. 72. In addition, rodders in the 1950s routinely bored them out by (to ). French-built 255 engines were fitted to the (SUMB) light trucks of the French military. When these were decommissioned around 1990, they provided a new source of little-worn engines for the hotrodding community. The block metallurgy, being much later, was also stronger than the originals. =337= The largest displacement version (at ) of the production Ford flathead V8 engine was designed for large truck service. When Lincoln could not produce the V12 engine it wanted for the 1949 model year, the 337 engine was adapted for passenger car use. The 337 features a bore and a stroke. It was introduced in the 1948 two and a half ton and three ton Ford trucks and the 1949 Lincoln passenger cars. It was produced through the 1951 model year. In 1952 it was replaced in the Lincoln passenger cars and Ford three ton trucks with the Lincoln Y-block overhead-valve V8. The two and a half ton Ford trucks got a version of the 317 engine. In the song \\"Hot Rod Lincoln\\", the engine referred to in the original lyrics was a Lincoln V12 not mentioned in the Commander Cody version.

It received positive critical reviews and was nominated for two Academy Awards. The screenplay for the film was adapted by Kōbō Abe from his 1962 novel. Plot An amateur entomologist and schoolteacher, Niki Junpei (Eiji Okada), leaves Tokyo and goes on an expedition to study an unclassified species of beetle that are found in a vast sand dune. After a long day of searching under the scorching sun and losing track of time, Junpei misses the last bus ride home to civilization. Fortunately, a village elder (Kōji Mitsui) and some of his fellow local villagers suggest that he stay the night at their village, offering Junpei a place to stay. After some persuasion by the villager, Junpei agrees and is then guided down a rope ladder to a hut at the bottom of a sand dune to stay with a young widow (Kyōko Kishida). Junpei settles into the hut where he will spend the night with this mysterious young widow, who feeds him a nutritious traditional Japanese dinner consisting of broiled fish, rice, and soup. After some short conversation and small talk, Junpei discovers that the woman, a meek and simple lady, lost her husband and daughter in a sandstorm and now lives alone. The child and father's dead body is said to be buried under the sand somewhere near the hut. She is employed by the villagers to dig sand for sale to be used in concrete and to save the house from burial in the advancing sand. After dinner, the woman goes outside to shovel the sand into a bucket, where the villagers reel it in from the top of the dune. Junpei offers to help but she quickly denies, telling him that he is a guest and there is no need for him to help on the first day. Junpei wakes up with a start the next morning and gets ready to go back to his home in Tokyo. When Junpei tries to leave, he finds that the ladder is gone, quickly realizing that the ladder was a rope ladder which is anchored from the top of the pit. The realizations rush into Junpei's head and it becomes clear to him that he is stuck in this sand pit with this woman and there is no way to escape as the sand that surrounds the hut does not have enough grip to climb up. The villagers expect him to become the woman's husband and to assist her in digging sand. Junpei also realizes that this is the woman's life, where she digs in order to live, since if she doesn't, the rations from the villagers would not be provided and also the sand will eventually swallow her alive. Junpei has been put into a never ending life sentence trap where he will constantly need to dig in order to live. Junpei becomes the widow's lover, but he still holds on tight to the motivation to one day escape from the dune. One morning, using an improvised grappling hook, he escapes from the sand dune and runs away, with the villagers soon giving chase. Junpei is unfamiliar with the geography of the area and becomes trapped in quicksand. The villagers free him from the quicksand and return him to the hut in the sand dune. Eventually, Junpei resigns himself to his situation. He requests time to watch the nearby sea, and the villagers offer to grant it if he has sex with the woman while they watch, but she denies and fends him off. Through his persistent effort to trap a crow as a messenger, he discovers a way to draw water from the damp sand at night and becomes absorbed in the task of perfecting the technique, to the point of unhealthy obsession. When it is discovered that the woman is ill from an ectopic pregnancy, the villagers take her to a doctor, leaving the rope ladder when they go. Given the one chance to escape that Junpei has been insisting for a long time, Junpei instead chooses to stay, presumably having found purpose in his water extraction experiments and his life with the woman and baby. The film's final shot is of a police report that shows that Junpei has been missing for seven years. Cast * Eiji Okada as Niki Junpei, an amateur entomologist and schoolteacher from Tokyo. Okada was cast in various Japanese films in the 1950s, but it was not until he appeared in Alain Resnais's 1959 film about the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that he gained a worldwide reputation. He has been in over 130 films in his lifetime, best known for his roles in Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959); Woman in the Dunes; and The Boy Detectives Club - The Iron Fiend (1957).https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/05/obituaries/eiji-okada-75-japanese- co-star-of-hiroshima-mon-amour.html * Kyōko Kishida as the widow in the dunes. Kishida was a Japanese actress, voice actress, and writer of children's books. She was best known for Woman in the Dunes; Ninja, a Band of Assassins (1962); and An Autumn Afternoon (1962). She was a founding member of the theater group Engeki Shudan En (formed in 1975). * Kōji Mitsui as the village elder who lures the entomologist to the widow's home. Mitsui was a popular character actor and favorite of Ozu and Kurosawa, well-remembered for his award-winning performance in the latter's The Lower Depths. The actor was billed above the film's title on the original Woman in the Dunes film poster, alongside Okada and Kishida, including the standard studio-era convention of appending his name with small characters indicating that Toho had borrowed the contracted player from Shochiku. Production =Development= Prior to the production of Woman in the Dunes, Hiroshi Teshigahara directed , a.k.a. The Pitfall and Kashi To Kodomo, which was written by Kōbō Abe. Pitfall was Teshigahara's first feature, and the first of his four film collaborations with Abe and Takemitsu. =Technical details= With a run time of 123 minutes / 147 minutes (director's cut), the film was shot in 35 mm negative format by Hiroshi Segawa, the director of photography. =Location= Woman in the Dunes was shot on location at Tottori Sand Dunes, Tottori Prefecture, Japan. They form the only large dune system in Japan. The dunes were created by sediment deposits carried from the Chūgoku Mountains by the Sendai River into the Sea of Japan.https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e8102.html =Release= The roadshow version of Woman in the Dunes was released in Japan on February 15, 1964 where it was distributed by Toho. The general release for Woman in the Dunes in Japan was April 18, 1964; the film was cut to 127 minutes. The film was released in the United States by Pathe Contemporary Films with English subtitles on September 17, 1964. The film ran at 127 minutes. The film was also featured in the New York Film Festival on September 16, 1964. The film was also featured in several other film festivals across the world such as the Cannes Film Festival in France, Adelaide Film Festival in Australia, and Clasicos del Cine Japones in Argentina on November 21, 2000. The Criterion Collection released a DVD box set collecting Woman in the Dunes in its original length along with Teshigahara's Pitfall and The Face of Another in 2007. This release is now out of print. In August 2016, Criterion released the film as a stand-alone Blu-ray with a brand new high definition transfer. Critical reception The film has a rating of 100% on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 critical reviews with an average rating of 8.5/10. It was one of the ten best films chosen by Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky. Roger Ebert inducted Woman in the Dunes into his Great Movies list in 1998. Viewing the work as a retelling of the Sisyphus myth, he wrote, \\"There has never been sand photography like this (no, not even in \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\"), and by anchoring the story so firmly in this tangible physical reality, the cinematographer, Hiroshi Segawa, helps the director pull off the difficult feat of telling a parable as if it is really happening.\\" Strictly Film School describes it as \\"a spare and haunting allegory for human existence\\". According to Max Tessier, the main theme of the film is the desire to escape from society. https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-woman- in-the-dunes-1964 The film's composer, Toru Takemitsu, was praised. Nathaniel Thompson wrote, \\"[Takemitsu's] often jarring, experimental music here is almost a character unto itself, insinuating itself into the fabric of the celluloid as imperceptibly as the sand.\\"Thompson, Nathaniel. \\"Woman in the Dunes\\". tcm.com. Retrieved 28 January 2013. Ebert also stated that the score \\"doesn't underline the action but mocks it, with high, plaintive notes, harsh, like a metallic wind.\\" =Awards= The film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival and, somewhat unusually for an avant-garde film, was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in the same year (losing to Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow). In 1965, Teshigahara was nominated for the Best Director Oscar (losing to Robert Wise for The Sound of Music). In 1967, the film won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.

Standards and Practices also ensures fairness on televised game shows, in which they are the adjunct to the judges at the production company level. They also have the power to reprimand and to recommend the termination of television network stars and employees for violations of standards and practices. Examples of intervention *The Standards and Practices department of NBC censored one of Jack Paar's jokes on the February 10, 1960, episode of The Tonight Show. Paar was so very taken aback by the network's decision to censor the joke, he walked off the live show the very next day. As he left his desk in the middle of the program, he said, \\"I am leaving The Tonight Show. There must be a better way of, uh, making a living than this.\\" Paar reappeared on March 7, 1960, strolled on stage, struck a pose, and said, \\"As I was saying before I was interrupted...\\" After the audience erupted in applause, Paar continued, \\"When I walked off, I said there must be a better way of making a living. Well, I've looked... and there isn't.\\" He then went on to explain his departure with typical frankness: \\"Leaving the show was a childish and perhaps emotional thing. I have been guilty of such action in the past and will perhaps be again. I'm totally unable to hide what I feel. It is not an asset in show business, but I shall do the best I can to amuse and entertain you and let other people speak freely, as I have in the past.\\" * Episode 97 of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003) was unaired in the United States until 2015 due to pressures from Fox Broadcast & Standards (although 4Kids Entertainment leased the time from the network for their FoxBox block and aired the series, it still had to meet Fox's broadcast standards). On the official TMNT website, Lloyd Goldfine states: The episode was finally aired on August 2nd, 2015 in the United States following the purchase of the franchise by ViacomCBS. *The final three episodes of the first season of Moral Orel were held back for various amounts of time by Standards and Practices due to being too dark and over the top sexually crude even for Adult Swim, which airs many shows rated TV-MA. Another episode entitled \\"God's Chef\\" was delayed for months before the Adult Swim network was able to show it. It has since been released uncensored along with the rest of season 1 and part of season 2 on DVD. *Adult Swim programming director Kim Manning revealed in the network's now defunct online message boards that Adult Swim inquired into airing Elfen Lied in April 2006 but was rejected by its Standards and Practices department because the series contained graphic violence and nudity. The only way the department would approve its airing was to have it extensively edited, so the network ultimately decided not to broadcast at the expense of altering the original work at such a level. Manning stated in the same post that this was also the case with Gantz. *X-Men: The Animated Series was very heavily influenced by BS&P.; Unlike the comic book, characters were rarely ever in any danger and characters almost never hit each other directly. *The CGI series ReBoot was heavily censored by ABC during its two-season run on the network. The network announced the show would be canceled after its second season after it was purchased by The Walt Disney Company, which would make way for a schedule of all Disney-produced series. The writers wrote scripts for episodes that mocked ABC's S&P; department due to it being canceled, including the insertion of unnoticed profanity within a stream of binary numbers. ReBoot went on to produce another successful season and two made-for-TV movies on other networks which had less strict S&P; departments and content standards. Game show incidents Resulting from the 1950s quiz show scandals, game shows have been closely monitored by network standards and practices departments for possible irregularities. When an incident occurs, the most common resolution is to permit the contestant to appear on the game again at a later date. =The Price Is Right= On rare occasions, contestants who have lost games because of procedural irregularities have been awarded the prizes. Irregularities have occurred when either the prize descriptions or prices displayed for the item in question have been incorrect, mechanical errors/malfunctions with certain pricing game props, or administrative errors by models or the host (such as a misheard bid, models not doing what the contestant requested). When such an error occurs, the contestant is awarded any prizes in question. If the error is discovered before the ensuing Showcase Showdown (on hour shows), the host informs the contestant upon returning from commercial or before the Showdown, and the contestant is re-seeded for the Showcase Showdown based on the additional winnings. If the error is discovered after the ensuing Showcase Showdown, either a disclaimer appears or is read by the announcer during the closing credits of the show. If a contestant is discovered to be ineligible, the ineligible contestant will forfeit all prizes, and likewise a disclaimer appears or a statement is read by the announcer at the end of the show. If the ineligible contestant is found to have won a One Bid, the contestants on Contestants' Row at the time the ineligible contestant was playing and did not win a One Bid are entitled to return to the show immediately once the infraction is discovered, per game show regulations, as their appearance was compromised by an ineligible contestant, pursuant to all game show regulations. The ten-year rule (in which a contestant that gets called up on stage during the show may return if their last appearance on the show was at least 10 years to the day of airing) imposed in 2007 will not be in effect if a contestant lost a One Bid to an ineligible contestant and did not win a further One Bid during that episode. One of the contestants on the original September 6, 1972 episode (the third show overall) was the common-law wife of a cameraman, and therefore ineligible to appear on any CBS game show. The episode never aired, but the other winners kept their prizes (a replacement show was taped and aired in its place). In a playing of Plinko taped July 22, 2008, a prop official forgot to remove a fishing line used in the taping of a previous promotion for the official Ludia video game (which guided the chip into a confined pattern leading into the $10,000 channel) before having it readied for game play. A contestant won $30,000 before the mistake was discovered by Associate Producer Adam Sandler (who is now the show's lead producer; not to be confused with the actor). The game was repaired by having the line removed, and the contestant started at $0. The contestant was allowed to keep the $30,000 because of the violation of procedure, plus the money won during the actual game; however, the $30,000 did not count towards the contestant's cumulative winnings on the show. During a September 22, 2008 taping, contestant Terry Kneiss made a perfect Showcase bid. CBS Standards and Practices, host Drew Carey, and producer Kathy Greco became highly suspicious that another party in the studio audience had supplied Kneiss with the bid, which then resulted in a stop down as an investigation took place. Although the contestant was ultimately awarded the prizes, the show air date was moved back from its original schedule. As a result of the incident, the show changed its practice regarding prizes, adding up to 30 new prizes which began appearing each taping week. Carey wrote on his blog before the 2009 season premiere that with so few prizes being offered, \\"It was possible, if one wanted, to watch the show for a while and memorize the price of almost every prize we offered.\\" The show wanted to prevent a situation similar to a 1984 Press Your Luck incident where a contestant memorized the light pattern to win where the contestant could find the top dollar space that would not hold a penalty space. Since 2009, CBS Standards and Practices also requires a disclaimer regarding the business interest of host Drew Carey to be mentioned any time a prize features game tickets featuring the Seattle Sounders FC Major League Soccer club, or a player of Sounders FC makes an appearance to present a prize on the show, or the club and its players is mentioned by the host or contestant. If a Sounders FC prize package is offered in a One Bid, pricing game or in the Showcase, Carey must mention on-air his ownership stake during the bidding. On the December 15, 2010 episode, after a contestant wore Sounders FC merchandise and the contestant and host talked about the team, the show ran a disclaimer in the credits stating Carey's ownership interest in Sounders FC. Disclaimers may also be run if other MLS club kits are worn on- air. In one situation, a theme week with rule changes caused a Standards and Practices violation. On April 23, 2013, during Big Money Week, a contestant played Grand Game for $100,000 instead of the normal prize of $10,000. The contestant lost at the third guess, which normally is $100, but was $1,000 for Big Money Week. When a contestant has three successful guesses, the contestant is asked if they are to risk their $1,000 for $10,000, but if they are wrong, they lose everything. If a contestant has one or two successful guesses, the wrong answer denotes the contestant retains what they had won in the game. The board operator flipped the game board to show loss at $1,000, where the game board displays 0 (Gas Money displays \\"0000\\" when a contestant loses the game; Grand Game displays 0 only if the contestant gambles and misses on the fourth guess). At the ensuing Showcase Showdown, host Drew Carey informed the contestant the official committed a Standards and Practices violation, and the contestant won $1,000, as was prescribed in the rules for two correct guesses but missing on the third (since the game started at $10 instead of $1 for this playing). =Other game shows= Contestants on other game shows, such as Jeopardy! and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, have been brought back on later episodes after a judging error or an error related to question material had been discovered. Other contestants have had prize money awarded despite not seeing their episodes air due to circumstances beyond theirs or the show's control. Press Your Luck In an episode of Press Your Luck, the three players were asked a question regarding which cartoon character used the phrase \\"Sufferin' Succotash!\\" After the first contestant buzzed in with the answer \\"Sylvester\\", host Peter Tomarken gave two other choices of Goofy and Daffy Duck. The other two contestants all went with Sylvester, but Tomarken said the correct answer was Daffy Duck. In actuality, both Sylvester and Daffy Duck have said the phrase. During post-production of the episode the error was discovered and a taped segment, in which Tomarken got a \\"phone call\\" from Looney Tunes voice actor Mel Blanc (in the voice of Sylvester), explained the mistake and that all three contestants would be invited back on future episodes. Jeopardy! * In 1999, a Jeopardy! contestant who lost on a Jeopardy! Teen Tournament game on a questionable ruling during Final Jeopardy! was ordered to be brought back for the 2000 College Championship. * The September 11 through September 14, 2001 episodes of Jeopardy! aired only on a few stations in the United States due to continuous breaking news coverage of the September 11 attacks wholesale pre-empting the show throughout the United States and Canada outside of a few non-news carrying independent stations airing it. As Jeopardy! has rules where the funds for the cash prizes won by contestants on the series are only issued a set period after the episode has aired (and where the show's confidentiality agreement regarding the results of a game has not been breached), the program's Standards and Practices had to issue a one-time exception for those contestants (along with others who had won cash and prizes on sister series Wheel of Fortune on the same airdates [which also has the same policy regarding the timing of the awarding of cash and prizes]) due to the extraordinary circumstance where the results were unseen until cycled into the show's weekend rerun feed or aired on Game Show Network years later, while the Wheel of Fortune episodes were aired early on Sunday, September 16, 2001 on WJLA-TV in Washington, D.C. after midnight (aside from this, they have not been shown anywhere in reruns since); these episodes are available at archive.org. * A January 30, 2008 episode of Jeopardy! resulted in Arianna Kelly being brought back on an episode on July 8, 2008 when officials found questionable calls during game play against her during that episode. * On occasion, an answer will have a different correct question when the show was recorded compared to the time the show airs. When that happens, the date of taping will appear on screen as the answer is read in order to comply with Standards and Practices. An example of this was during the second 2014 Jeopardy! Teen Tournament first round match: the answer in the $400 My Present Government Job category in the Jeopardy! round was, \\"Kathleen Sebelius, Insuring America, one person at a time.\\" The correct response was \\"What is the Secretary of Health and Human Services?\\" However, she had resigned from that position in April 2014, between the taping of the match in March 2014 and the July 22, 2014 broadcast. The show posted a disclaimer, \\"Recorded in March 2014,\\" as the category was being read. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? In 2001, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? contestant Ed Toutant was given the following question: Toutant selected Tomato, but the show said it was Potato. It was later found the answer was flawed after further research from Marc Knight, a professor at Oxford University Department of Plant Sciences. The glowing potato was, in fact, developed in Scotland; however, Knight had developed a glowing tomato in England. Therefore, Toutant's answer of tomato was correct. The $860,000 Skins Game jackpot was in use at the time, and he was allowed to play for the million and the skins game jackpot, which he eventually won. Patrick Hugh won $1,000 during a Season 7 (syndicated) episode, but a critical word in his $25,000 question was found to be misspelled. He was given the option of being awarded $25,000 \\"no questions asked\\" or to forfeit his winnings and return to the show and begin his game with a new $25,000 question with all four of his lifelines reinstated. Hugh chose the latter option, used two lifelines (Ask the Audience/Double-Dip) to correctly answer his new $25,000 question, and missed the $50,000 question after using his Phone-a-Friend and Ask-the-Expert lifelines, so he left with $25,000 this time. Million Dollar Money Drop On December 20, 2010, Million Dollar Money Drop contestants Gabe Okoye and Brittany Mayi lost $800,000 on a bad question: * Which of these was sold in stores first? # Macintosh Computer # Sony Walkman # Post-it notes They decided to risk $800,000 on the Post-it notes. According to the show, the Post-it notes were first sold in 1980 and the Walkman was first sold in 1979. The answer was flawed after Internet research indicated that the Post-its were first tested for sale in four cities in 1977 before their nationwide introduction in 1980. In a statement by executive producer Jeff Apploff, the information obtained by the show's research department was incomplete. Due to this research error, Gabe and Brittany were invited back for a second chance to play the game, even though their question was not the deciding question in their game. A similar situation happened on the UK version in October 2010 on a Doctor Who question. In other countries * In the Philippines, the term network ombudsman (also referred to as office of the network ombudsman) is used for this department. Notes References * Keith Adler.

Radio emission comes from a wide variety of sources. Such objects are among the most extreme and energetic physical processes in the universe. History In 1932, American physicist and radio engineer Karl Jansky detected radio waves coming from an unknown source in the center of our galaxy. Jansky was studying the origins of radio frequency interference for Bell Laboratories. He found \\"...a steady hiss type static of unknown origin\\", which eventually he concluded had an extraterrestrial origin. This was the first time that radio waves were detected from outer space. The first radio sky survey was conducted by Grote Reber and was completed in 1941. In the 1970s, some stars in our galaxy were found to be radio emitters, one of the strongest being the unique binary MWC 349. Sources: solar system =The Sun= As the nearest star, the Sun is the brightest radiation source in most frequencies, down to the radio spectrum at 300 MHz (1 m wavelength). When the Sun is quiet, the galactic background noise dominates at longer wavelengths. During geomagnetic storms, the Sun will dominate even at these low frequencies. section 1.5.4 The Radio Spectrum =Jupiter= Oscillation of electrons trapped in the magnetosphere of Jupiter produce strong radio signals, particularly bright in the decimeter band. The magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output. (archived version) Sources: galactic = The galactic center = The galactic center of the Milky Way was the first radio source to be detected. It contains a number of radio sources, including Sagittarius A, the compact region around the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*,as well as the black hole itself. When flaring, the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole lights up, detectable in radio waves. =Supernova remnants= Supernova remnants often show diffuse radio emission. Examples include Cassiopeia A, the brightest extrasolar radio source in the sky, and the Crab Nebula. =Neutron Stars= Pulsars Schematic view of a pulsar. The sphere in the middle represents the neutron star, the curves indicate the magnetic field lines, the protruding cones represent the emission beams and the green line represents the axis on which the star rotates. Supernovas sometimes leave behind dense spinning neutron stars called pulsars. They emit jets of charged particles which emit synchrotron radiation in the radio spectrum. Examples include the Crab Pulsar, the first pulsar to be discovered. Pulsars and quasars (dense central cores of extremely distant galaxies) were both discovered by radio astronomers. In 2003 astronomers using the Parkes radio telescope discovered two pulsars orbiting each other, the first such system known. Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) Sources  Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are a type of neutron stars discovered in 2006 by a team led by Maura McLaughlin from the Jodrell Bank Observatory at the University of Manchester in the UK. RRATs are believed to produce radio emissions which are very difficult to locate, because of their transient nature. Early efforts have been able to detect radio emissions (sometimes called RRAT flashes) for less than one second a day, and, like with other single-burst signals, one must take great care to distinguish them from terrestrial radio interference. Distributing computing and the Astropulse algorithm may thus lend itself to further detection of RRATs. =Star forming regions= Short radio waves are emitted from complex molecules in dense clouds of gas where stars are giving birth. Spiral galaxies contain clouds of neutral hydrogen and carbon monoxide which emit radio waves. The radio frequencies of these two molecules were used to map a large portion of the Milky Way galaxy. Sources: extra-galactic =Radio galaxies= Many galaxies are strong radio emitters, called radio galaxies. Some of the more notable are Centaurus A and Messier 87. Quasars (short for \\"quasi-stellar radio source\\") were one of the first point-like radio sources to be discovered. Quasars' extreme redshift led us to conclude that they are distant active galactic nuclei, believed to be powered by black holes. Active galactic nuclei have jets of charged particles which emit synchrotron radiation. One example is 3C 273, the optically brightest quasar in the sky. Merging galaxy clusters often show diffuse radio emission. =Cosmic microwave background= The cosmic microwave background is blackbody background radiation left over from the Big Bang (the rapid expansion, roughly 13.8 billion years ago, that was the beginning of the universe. = Extragalactic pulses = D. R. Lorimer and others analyzed archival survey data and found a 30-jansky dispersed burst, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3° from the Small Magellanic Cloud. They reported that the burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. In a recent paper, they argue that current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 gigaparsec distant. The fact that no further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence (fusion) of relativistic objects. It is suggested that hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes. Radio pulsar surveys such as Astropulse- SETI@home offer one of the few opportunities to monitor the radio sky for impulsive burst-like events with millisecond durations. Because of the isolated nature of the observed phenomenon, the nature of the source remains speculative. Possibilities include a black hole-neutron star collision, a neutron star-neutron star collision, a black hole-black hole collision, or some phenomenon not yet considered. In 2010 there was a new report of 16 similar pulses from the Parkes Telescope which were clearly of terrestrial origin, but in 2013 four pulse sources were identified that supported the likelihood of a genuine extragalactic pulsing population. These pulses are known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). The first observed burst has become known as the Lorimer burst. Blitzars are one proposed explanation for them. Sources: not yet observed =Primordial black holes= According to the Big Bang Model, during the first few moments after the Big Bang, pressure and temperature were extremely great. Under these conditions, simple fluctuations in the density of matter may have resulted in local regions dense enough to create black holes. Although most regions of high density would be quickly dispersed by the expansion of the universe, a primordial black hole would be stable, persisting to the present. One goal of Astropulse is to detect postulated mini black holes that might be evaporating due to \\"Hawking radiation\\". Such mini black holes are postulated to have been created during the Big Bang, unlike currently known black holes. Martin Rees has theorized that a black hole, exploding via Hawking radiation, might produce a signal that's detectable in the radio. The Astropulse project hopes that this evaporation would produce radio waves that Astropulse can detect. The evaporation wouldn't create radio waves directly. Instead, it would create an expanding fireball of high-energy gamma rays and particles. This fireball would interact with the surrounding magnetic field, pushing it out and generating radio waves. = ET = Previous searches by various \\"search for extraterrestrial intelligence\\" (SETI) projects, starting with Project Ozma, have looked for extraterrestrial communications in the form of narrow-band signals, analogous to our own radio stations. The Astropulse project argues that since we know nothing about how ET might communicate, this might be a bit closed-minded. Thus, the Astropulse Survey can be viewed as complementary to the narrow-band SETI@home survey as a by-product of the search for physical phenomena. =Other undiscovered phenomena = Explaining their recent discovery of a powerful bursting radio source, NRL astronomer Dr. Joseph Lazio stated: \\"Amazingly, even though the sky is known to be full of transient objects emitting at X- and gamma-ray wavelengths, very little has been done to look for radio bursts, which are often easier for astronomical objects to produce.\\" The use of coherent dedispersion algorithms and the computing power provided by the SETI network may lead to discovery of previously undiscovered phenomena.

He was known as the Father of Black Theatre in South Africa, and was one of the first writers to deal with life in the South African black townships. He produced 23 plays and television dramas between 1963 and 1992. He is also responsible for producing some of South Africa's leading musicians. And many past and present prominent artists, including Brenda Fassie, owe their first opportunities on stage to him. Biography Gibson Kente was raised in Stutterheim by his mother.Schauffer, D.

Accessed 24 July 2017. He never completed his studies, instead he joined a group known as Union of South African Artists (Union Artists) who were based at Dorkay House in central Johannesburg 2004\\\\. Mail & Guardian. Accessed 24 July 2017. The Union Artists offered black performers in South Africa training, royalty contracts and fair payment. Career In 1963, Kente produced his first play, Manana, The Jazz Prophet, which featured celebrated musicians Caiphus Semenya and Letta Mbulu.2015\\\\. Mail & Guardian. Accessed 24 July 2017. The play focused on Manana, a gospel preacher and prophet, whose main concern was to bring everybody to the Christian faith. In 1966, he wrote the musical Sikalo, which blended African gospel and township jazz. The musical was performed at the University of the Witwatersrand Great Hall. Kente's plays were popular for using township popular culture, slangs, fashion and topical issue to reflect on daily life.Gunner, L. (1990) Introduction: Forms of Popular Culture and the Struggle for Space. Journal of Southern African Studies, 2:16, 199–206. His success with his first two play motivated him to leave the Union Artists to start his own training centre and production company, GK Productions. He trained famous South African artists and entertainers such as Brenda Fassie, Nomsa Nene and Mbongeni Ngema in the garage of his home in Dube, Soweto. Kente also wrote music for artist such as Miriam Makeba and Letta Mbulu. Three of his plays drew criticism for being anti-apartheid (Segregation) and were banned: How Long, I Believe and Too Late. He was jailed for one year in 1976 on conclusion of the filming of his play How Long. The film was never released and the master negative of the film was given to the National Film Board in Pretoria. The National Film, Video and Sound Archives is the current custodian of this film. First performed in 1975, his play one-act play Too Late was banned by the Publications Control Board because it dealt with the death of Ntanana, a crippled girl, through brutal police action and apartheid bureaucracy. Another of his plays I Believe, was also banned. Another famous piece is Mama and the load, which some consider to be his best. In 1989, his Soweto home was firebombed burning early scripts and records. The garage at his home served as rehearsal room, set construction workshop, training centre and storeroom for GK Productions. It is estimates that before his death, Kente wrote 23 plays and three television dramas. Kente began his last play, The Call, when he was diagnosed HIV positive.

He is portrayed in the series by Mackenzie Crook as a self- important team leader proud of his alleged Lieutenant status in the Territorial Army. He spends his days annoying his co-workers at Wernham Hogg with his rigid enforcement of the rules and sycophantic attitude towards David Brent, whom he views as a friend. David Brent often has to correct Keenan over his apparent job title \\"Assistant regional manager\\" to \\"Assistant to the regional manager\\". His counterpart on the US series is Dwight Schrute. The character was originally meant to be a tough and fierce character in the mockumentary, but after Crook's audition, Ricky Gervais and Steven Merchant had to change his lines to fit his new personality.  Characteristics  Gareth flaunts his \\"team leader\\" status, despite deskmate Tim Canterbury's pointing out that it is a meaningless job title entailing more responsibility for the same pay. Nonetheless, Gareth takes the job very seriously. His attempts to throw his inflated sense of authority around the office rarely work, and it is clear that no one pays any attention to him. He does display certain concerns for his workers, mostly in the health and safety category. Tim plays endless pranks on Gareth, such as hiding his computer, putting his stapler in jelly (a prank that has been reprised in several other versions of The Office, including the US version), gluing his phone so that the receiver cannot be picked up (and then phoning him up) and playing on Gareth's naïveté by discussing warfare with language which could be interpreted as being homosexual in nature (e.g. 'the enemy has discovered your camp...and they've all entered your hole', 'taking a man from behind' or 'could you give a man a lethal blow?'). In the Christmas Special Gareth has become manager but Tim still plays practical jokes on him by stealing his keys and then locking him in his office. Gareth constantly shows naivety and unintended discrimination like David Brent. For example, Gareth attempts to disprove accusations of homophobia by mentioning that his compact disc collection includes George Michael, Pet Shop Boys and Queen, remarking that \\"they're all bummers\\"; Queen features prominently among his favourite music. His favourite band of all time is Mike + The Mechanics,Gareth Keenan's Homepage. BBC. Retrieved 30 March 2013. which is mentioned derisively by Tim in the bonus features of the series two DVD. Wherever possible, Gareth constantly boasts about his military skills and how they might come in useful in an office environment, such as how to kill a man with a single blow. Despite his experience in the Territorial Army, however, he exhibits a selfish, egotistical nature and seems to be physically weak. It's quite probable Gareth inherited his love for the military life from his father, who was also involved in the army some years ago. Keenan also enjoys kung-fu films and he drives a Triumph TR3 which he bought for £1,200 and restored. The vehicle is now believed (by Gareth) to be worth around £3,000. Gareth is also shown to have very little self-awareness, believing that his unthoughtful comments and occasional macho bravado are completely appropriate and will earn him the respect of his co-workers. His lack of self- awareness is also displayed when Tim and Dawn repeatedly insinuate homosexuality through questions about his military service without his understanding. Despite the tough personality he displays, Gareth also appears to be very vulnerable and neurotic. For example, when David announces he'll have to be leaving Wernham Hogg, Gareth breaks down in tears. Evidently, Gareth admires Brent and is eager to follow his lead. However, in the two episodes comprising the Christmas special he expresses strong disapproval of his former boss's laid-back, comical approach to management. Frequently comparing the mundane events that take place at Wernham Hogg with equivalent situations likely to occur on the battlefield, Gareth stresses the need for a shrewd, austere style of leadership. When impugning Brent's injection of comedy into the workplace he ridiculously attempts to justify his argument by suggesting that \\"in a battle situation\\" soldiers would more likely be inspired by a decisive, uncompromising leader than one who offered them jokes before their advance towards the enemy. Following Brent's departure, Gareth is made regional manager of the branch, although he still seems to command little respect - Tim's latest prank is to lock his boss in his office, requiring a desperate phone call to the receptionist's desk to secure his release. Through his office window, Gareth tells Oliver that \\"he's locked me in again\\", suggesting to the audience that this is not the first time that Tim has played this prank on the new Wernham Hogg manager. On the social side, Gareth portrays himself as somewhat of a ladies' man and does in fact enjoy some success with women (often in the local nightclub \\"Chasers\\") but in contrast to Tim's interest in Dawn, Gareth's 'success' with women is sexual in nature rather than romantic. His attempts to woo female co-workers are never successful. Generally, he is disliked in most quarters, due largely to his annoying and inappropriate behaviour, as well as his arrogance. He does however have several close friends, some of whom include \\"Jimmy the Perv\\" (who lives up to his name by repeatedly paying Dawn Tinsley for kisses for Comic Relief, with increasing lasciviousness each time), 'The Oggmonster' (a very tall figure with astigmatism, played by The Office co-creator Stephen Merchant) and unseen characters known only by the nicknames \\"Fish Fingers\\" and \\"Gobbler\\". At certain points, Tim and Gareth seem to make up and be friendly. However, those instances are quickly overshadowed by more practical jokes thrown at him by Tim and Dawn.

It was named after Ábrahám Ganz, the founder and the manager of the company. It is probably best known for the manufacture of tramcars, but was also a pioneer in the application of three-phase alternating current to electric railways. Ganz also made ships (Ganz Danubius), bridge steel structures (Ganz Acélszerkezet) and high-voltage equipment (Ganz Transelektro). In the early 20th century the company experienced its heyday, it became the third largest industrial enterprise in Kingdom of Hungary after the Manfréd Weiss Steel and Metal Works and the MÁVAG company. Since 1989, various parts of Ganz have been taken over by other companies.  History  Before 1919, the company built ocean liners, dreadnought type battleships and submarines, power plants, automobilesIván Boldizsár: NHQ; the New Hungarian Quarterly, Volume 16, Issue 2; Volume 16, Issues 59–60, p. 128Hungarian Technical Abstracts: Magyar Műszaki Lapszemle, Volumes 10–13, p. 41 and many types of fighter aircraft.Iván T. Berend: Case Studies on Modern European Economy: Entrepreneurship, Inventions, and Institutions, p. 151 The company was founded by Abraham Ganz in 1844. He was invited to Pest, Hungary, by Count István Széchenyi and became the casting master at the Roller Mill Plant (referred to as Hengermalom in Hungarian). In 1854 he began manufacturing hard cast railroad wheels in his own plant founded in 1844. He successfully developed a railway wheel casting technology; it was the new method of \\"crust- casting\\" to produce cheap yet sturdy iron railway wheels, which greatly contributed to the rapid railway development in Central Europe. 86,074 pieces of hard cast wheels had been sold to 59 European railway companies until 1866. Consequently, this factory played an important role in building the infrastructure of the Hungarian Kingdom and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. At this time the agricultural machines, steam locomotives, pumps and the railway carriages were the main products. At the beginning of the 20th century, 60 to 80% of the factory's products were sold for export. At the end of the 19th century, the products of the Ganz and Partner Iron Mill and Machine Factory (hereinafter referred to as Ganz Works) promoted the expansion of alternating- current power transmissions. =Prominent engineers= Prominent engineers at Ganz works included András Mechwart, Károly Zipernowsky, Miksa Déri, Ottó Titusz Bláthy, Kálmán Kandó and Ernő Wilczek. =Revolution in the milling industry= The invention of the modern industrial mill (the roller mill ) – by András Mechwart in 1874 – guaranteed a solid technological superiority and revolutionized the world's milling industry. Budapest's milling industry grow the second largest in the world, behind the American Minneapolis. The Hungarian grain export increased by 66% within some years. =Power plants, generators turbines and transformers= The Hungarian \\"ZBD\\" Team: Miksa Déri, Ottó Bláthy, Károly Zipernowsky first high efficiency transformer prototypes (1885; Széchenyi István Memorial Exhibition, Nagycenk, Hungary) In 1878, the company's general manager András Mechwart founded the Department of Electrical Engineering headed by Károly Zipernowsky. Engineers Miksa Déri and Ottó Bláthy also worked at the department producing direct-current machines and arc lamps.  Generators  The first turbo generators were water turbines which drove electric generators. The first Hungarian water turbine was designed by engineers of the Ganz Works in 1866. Mass production of dynamo generators started in 1883.http://www.sze.hu/~mgergo/EnergiatudatosEpulettervezes/2013_1_feladat/ErosErika/V%EDzenergia%20hasznos%EDt%E1s%20szigetk%F6zi%20szemmel%20EL%D5AD%C1SANYAG.pdf The missing link of a full Voltage Sensitive/Voltage Intensive (VSVI) system was the reliable alternating current constant voltage generator. Therefore, the invention of the constant voltage generator by the Ganz Works in 1883 had a crucial role in the beginnings of industrial scale AC power generation, because only these type of generators can produce a stable output voltage, regardless of the actual load.  Transformers  In cooperation, Zipernovsky, Bláthy and Déri (known as the ZBD team) constructed and patented the transformer. The \\"transformer\\" was named by Ottó Titusz Bláthy. The three invented the first high efficiency, closed core shunt connection transformer. They also invented the modern power distribution system: Instead of a series of connections they connected supply transformers in parallel to the main line. The transformer patents described two basic principles. Loads were to be connected in parallel, not in series as had been the general practice until 1885. Additionally, the inventors described the closed armature as an essential part of the transformer. Both factors assisted the stabilisation of voltage under varying load, and allowed definition of standard voltages for distribution and loads. The parallel connection and efficient closed core made construction of electrical distribution systems technically and economically feasible. The Ganz Works built the first transformers using iron plating of enamelled mild iron wire, and started to use laminated cores to eliminate eddy currents  AC Power stations  In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the company supplied, electrical equipment for the world's first power station to use AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network. This was the Italian steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant. Following the introduction of the transformer, the Ganz Works changed over to production of alternating-current equipment. For instance, Rome's electricity was supplied by hydroelectric plant and long-distance energy transfer.Hungarian Inventors and their Inventions File:Turbinaszerelés.jpgconstruction of a Ganz water turbo generator (1886) File:PSM V56 D0433 Direct connected electric railway generator.pngPSM V56 D0433 direct connected electric railway generator (1899) File:Blathy in a Ganz turbogenerator.jpgOttó Bláthy in the armature of a turbo generator (1904) File:ZEMP244.jpgGanz 21.000 kW Transformer (1911, weight: 38t) File:A Ganz Gyár csarnoka, Budapest, Kisrókus utca (1922) Fortepan 95160.jpgA generator assembly hall of the Ganz Works (1922) File:Gorskii 04414u.jpgAlternators in a hydroelectric station on the Murghab River.

Between 1901 and 1908, Ganz Works of Budapest and de Dion-Bouton of Paris collaborated to build a number of railcars for the Hungarian State Railways together with units with de Dion-Bouton boilers, Ganz steam motors and equipments, and Raba carriages built by the Raba Hungarian Wagon and Machine Factory in Győr. In 1908, the Borzsavölgyi Gazdasági Vasút (BGV), a narrow-gauge railway in Carpathian Ruthenia (today's Ukraine), purchased five railcars from Ganz and four railcars from the Hungarian Royal State Railway Machine Factory with de Dion-Bouton boilers. The Ganz company started to export steam motor railcars to the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Japan, Russia and Bulgaria.Railroad Gazette – Volume 37 – Page 296 (printed in 1904)Modern Machinery – Volumes 19–20 – Page 206 (Printed in 1906)John Robertson Dunlap, Arthur Van Vlissingen, John Michael Carmody: Factory and Industrial Management – Volume 33 – Page 1003 (printed in 1907 = The World's first electrified main railway line in Italy = The Ganz Works, having identified the significance of induction motors and synchronous motors, commissioned Kálmán Kandó to develop them. In 1894, Hungarian engineer Kálmán Kandó developed high-voltage three-phase AC motors and generators for electric locomotives. The first-ever electric rail vehicle manufactured by Ganz Works was a 6 HP pit locomotive with direct current traction system. The first Ganz made asynchronous rail vehicles (altogether 2 pieces) were supplied in 1898 to Évian-les-Bains (France) with a 37 HP asynchronous traction system. The Ganz Works won the tender for electrification of the Valtellina Railway in Italy in 1897. Under the management, and on the basis of plans from Kálmán Kandó, three phase electric power at 3 kV and 15 Hz was fed through two upper wires and the rails. The electricity was produced in a dedicated power station and the system operated for thirty years from 1902. Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106 km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices. The three-phase two-wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as \\"the Italian system\\". Kandó was invited in 1905 to undertake the management of Società Italiana Westinghouse and led the development of several Italian electric locomotives. In 1918, =Invention of the Phase Converter= Kandó invented and developed the rotary phase converter, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50 Hz) single phase AC of the high-voltage national networks. After World War I, at the Ganz Works, Kálmán Kandó constructed a single-phase electric railway system using 16 kV at 50 Hz. A similar system, but using 15 kV at 16.7 Hz, later became widely used in Europe. The main attribute of Kandó's 50 Hz system was that it was fed by the normal power network, so dedicated railway power stations became unnecessary. Because of the early death of Kálmán Kandó, László Verebélÿ continued the work for the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV).

In 1981/82 Ganz-Mávag supplied to OSE 11 B-B diesel-hydraulic DHM7-9 locomotives, designated as class A-251. Finally, in 1983, OSE bought eleven 3-car metre gauge trainsets, designated as Class A-6461. All these locomotives and trainsets have been withdrawn with the exception of one standard and one metre gauge trainset. In 1982/83 Ganz-Mávag supplied an order for electric multiple units to New Zealand Railways Corporation for Wellington suburban services. The order was made in 1979, and was for 44 powered units and 44 trailer units, see New Zealand EM class electric multiple unit.  Ganz-MÁVAG Trams  Ganz-MÁVAG delivered 29 trams (2 car sets) to Alexandria, Egypt from 1985 to 1986. =Shipbuilding, Ganz - Danubius= In 1911, the Ganz Company merged with the Danubius shipbuilding company, which was the largest shipbuilding company in Hungary. From 1911, the unified company adopted the \\"Ganz–Danubius\\" brand name. In the beginning of the 20th century the company had 19 shipyards on the Danube and the Adriatic Sea in the city of Rijeka and Pula.History of Ganz Danubius As Ganz Danubius, the company became involved in shipbuilding before, and during, World War I. Ganz was responsible for building the dreadnought , all of the Novara-class cruisers, and built diesel-electric U-boats at its shipyard in Budapest, for final assembly at Fiume. Several U-boats of the U-XXIX class, U-XXX class, U-XXXI class and U-XXXII class were completed, A number of other types were laid down, but remained incomplete at the war's end.http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm Sieche article on KuK U-Boats By the end of the First World War, 116 naval vessels had been built by The Ganz- Danubius company. The company also produces transatlantic ocean liners for passenger lines Trieste - New York, Trieste - Montevideo, as a reflection of already formed wave of mass migration from Central Europe to America.

During World War I, the company made many types of Albatros and Fokker fighter planes. The world's first turboprop engine was the Jendrassik Cs-1 designed by the Hungarian mechanical engineer György Jendrassik. It was built and tested in the Ganz factory in Budapest between 1939 and 1942. It was planned to be fitted to the Varga RMI-1 X/H twin-engined reconnaissance bomber designed by László Varga in 1940, but the program was cancelled. Jendrassik had also designed a small-scale 75 kW turboprop in 1937. After World War II In 1947, the Ganz Works was nationalised and in 1949 it became independent and six big companies came into existence, including the Ganz Transformer Factory. In 1959, Ganz Wagon and Machine Factory merged with the MÁVAG Locomotive and Machine Factory under the name of Ganz-MÁVAG Locomotive, Wagon and Machine Works. Of the products of the Works, outstanding results were shown in the field of the manufacture of diesel railcars and multiple units. Traditional products included tramcars as well, and customers included the tramway network of Budapest. In the meantime the Foundry workshop was closed down. In 1974, the locomotive and wagon Works were merged under the name of Railway Vehicle Factory and then the machine construction branch went through significant development. The production of industrial and apartment house lifts became a new branch. Ganz-MÁVAG took over a lot of smaller plants in the 1960s and 1970s and their product range was extended. Among other things, they increased their bridge-building capacity. They made iron structures for several Tisza bridges, for the Erzsébet Bridge in Budapest, for public road bridges in Yugoslavia and for several industrial halls. The Ganz Shipyard experienced its most productive times during the four decades following nationalisation. In the course of this period 1100 ship units were produced, the number of completed seagoing ships was 240 and that of floating cranes was 663. As a result of the great economic and social crises of the 1980s, Ganz-MÁVAG had to be reorganised. The company was transformed into seven independent Works and three joint ventures. Ganz since 1989 In 1989, the British company Telfos Holdings gained a majority of the shares in Ganz Railway Vehicle Factory Co. Ltd. and the name of the company was changed to Ganz-Hunslet Co. Ltd. In the course of 1991 and 1992, the Austrian company Jenbacher Werke obtained 100% of the company's shares and consequently the railway vehicle factory is now a member of the international railway vehicle manufacturing group, Jenbacher Transport Systeme. At present, the Ganz Electric Works, under the name of Ganz-Ansaldo is a member of the Italian industrial giant, AnsaldoBreda. The Ganz Works were transformed into holdings. Ganz-Danubius was wound up in 1994. The Ganz Electric Meter Factory in Gödöllő became the member of the international Schlumberger group. In 2006, the power transmission and distribution sectors of Ganz Transelektro were acquired by Crompton Greaves,Ganz is now CG Retrieved 2009-11-28. but still doing business under the Ganz brand name, while the unit dealing with electric traction (propulsion and control systems for electric vehicles) was acquired by Škoda Transportation and is now a part of Škoda Electric.

In Yazidi creation stories, God created the world and entrusted it to the care of seven Holy Beings, often known as Angels or heft sirr ('the Seven Mysteries'), preeminent of which is Tawûsê Melek, the Peacock Angel. French anthropologist Zaïm Khenchelaoui, along with other scholars, believe that Melek Taus may correspond to the ancient Mesopotamian divinity of Tammuz. Like many aspects of the secretive Yazidi religion, Tawûsê Melek is subject to varied and ambiguous interpretations. The \\"Yazidi Book of Revelation\\" (Ketêbâ Jelwa), a text generally believed to have been written by non-Yazidis (along with the \\"Yazidi Black Book\\") in the early twentieth-century but based on Yazidi oral tradition, even though a nineteenth-century translation of the text exists, is purported to contain the words of Tawûsê Melek; it states that he allocates responsibilities, blessings and misfortunes upon humanity as he sees fit and that it is not for the race of Adam to question his choices. Religious significance The Yazidi consider Tawûsê Melek an emanation of God and a good, benevolent angel and leader of the archangels, who was entrusted to take care of the world after he passed a test and created the cosmos from the Cosmic egg. Yazidis believe Tawûsê Melek is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the archangels, not a fallen nor a disgraced angel, but an emanation of God himself. The Yazidi believe that the founder or reformer of their religion, Sheikh Adi Ibn Musafir, was an incarnation of Tawûsê Melek. Tawûsê Melek is sometimes transliterated Malak Ta'us, Malak Tawus, Malak Tawwus, or Malik Taws. Melek was borrowed from the Arabic term meaning “king” or “angel”. Tawûs is uncontroversially translated as “peacock” (in art and sculpture, Tawûsê Melek is depicted as peacock). However, peacocks are not native to the lands where Tawûsê Melek is worshipped. Among early Christians, the peacock represented immortality because of a folk belief that its flesh does not decay after death, and this symbolism has passed into Yazidi beliefs.Who, What, Why: Who are the Yazidis? at BBC World News Consequently, peacock imagery adorns Yazidi shrines, gateways, graves, and houses of worship. The Kitêba Cilwe (Book of Illumination), also known as the Book of Revelation, which claims to be the words of Tawûsê Melek himself, states that he allocates responsibilities, blessings, and misfortunes as he sees fit, and that it is not for the race of Adam to question him. Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir believed that the spirit of Tawûsê Melek is the same as his own; that is, that he was an avatar of the archangel. He is believed to have said: Yazidi accounts of creation differ from those of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Yazidi people believe that God first created Tawûsê Melek from his own illumination (Ronahî) and the other six archangels were created later. God ordered Tawûsê Melek not to bow to other beings. Then God created the other archangels and ordered them to bring him dust (Ax) from the Earth (Erd) and build the body of Adam. Then God gave life to Adam from his own breath and instructed all archangels to bow to Adam. The archangels obeyed, except for Tawûsê Melek. In answer to God, Tawûsê Melek replied, Then God praised him and made him the leader of all angels and his deputy on the Earth. Hence, the Yazidis believe that Tawûsê Melek is the representative of God on the face of the Earth, and comes down to the Earth on the first Wednesday of Nisan (April). Yazidis hold that God created Tawûsê Melek on this day, and celebrate it as New Year's Day. Yazidis argue that the order to bow to Adam was only a test for Tawûsê Melek, since if God commands anything then it must happen. (Bibe, dibe). In other words: God could have made him submit to Adam, but gave Tawûsê Melek the choice as a test. They believe that their respect and praise for Tawûsê Melek is a way to acknowledge his majestic and sublime nature. This idea is called Zanista Ciwaniyê (Knowledge of the Sublime). Sheikh Adî observed the story of Tawûsê Melek and believed in him. Alleged devil-worship Since the late 16th century, some Muslims have accused Yazidis of devil worship due to the similarity between the Quranic story of Iblis and the account of Tawûsê Melek's refusal to bow to Adam. Whereas Muslims revile Iblis for refusing to submit to God and bow to Adam, believing that his defiance caused him to fall from God's grace,Islam: Satan, sin, and repentance at Encyclopædia Britannica Yazidis revere Tawûsê Melek for loyalty towards God and believe that God's command to Tawûsê Melek was a test to see who is truly devoted to God alone. This narrative led to many misinterpretations, also made by Western scholars, who interpreted the Yazidi faith through their own cultural influences.D. N. MacKenzie Languages of Iran: Past and Present: Iranian Studies in Memoriam David Neil MacKenzie Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 2005ISBN 9783447052993 p. 78 Further accusations derived from narratives attributed to Melek Taus, which are actually foreign to Yazidism, probably introduced by either Muslims in the 9th century or Christian missionaries in the 20th century.Halil Savucu: Yeziden in Deutschland: Eine Religionsgemeinschaft zwischen Tradition, Integration und Assimilation Tectum Wissenschaftsverlag, Marburg 2016, , Section 16 Accusations of devil worship fueled centuries of violent persecution, which have led Yazidi communities to concentrate in remote mountainous regions of northwestern Iraq. The Yazidi taboo against the Arabic word Shaitan (الشیطان) and on words containing the consonants š (sh) and t/ṭ have been used to suggest a connection between this Tawûsê Melek and Iblis, although no evidence exists to suggest Yazidis worship Tawûsê Melek as the same figure.Michael Quentin Mortin, In the Heart of the Desert, 2007 , p. 131: ...their reputation as devil-worshippers was ill-deserved.... [T]here was no hellin Yazidism, since Malik Taus had repented for his sins.... They may have reserved a healthy respect for the devil, but the Yazidis never spoke his name 'Shaitan', and never worshipped him.\\" The \\"Yazidi Black Book\\", written by Western Orientalists, directly identifies Melek Taus with Azazil or Azrail. However Yazidis identify Melek Taus with Jibrail (Gabriel).

The grid from which the entire city is laid out originates at Temple Square, the location of the Salt Lake Temple. Location Downtown Salt Lake City is usually defined as the area approximately between North Temple and 400 South Streets north to south and about 500 East and 600 West Streets east to west. Downtown encompasses the areas of Temple Square, The Gateway, Main Street, the central business district, South Temple, and others. Along with local and state government and non profits, two primary business organizations - the Salt Lake Chamber and the Downtown Alliance promote Salt Lake CIty's downtown as the heart of the state, and as its most lively and diverse locale. History Downtown's layout was first planned in 1833, 17 years before Salt Lake City was founded. Joseph Smith designed the Plat of Zion, a plan for cities of 20,000 people each that followed city blocks with self-sufficient family farms surrounding several temples in the center. Smith meant for this plan to be applied to the City of Zion in the Midwestern United States, but following persecution and Smith's assassination, the plans were carried westward by the Mormon pioneers. Downtown Salt Lake began to form in 1847 when Brigham Young chose the site of the Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, forming the core of the settlement. Temple Square became the center of the grid system, bounded by South Temple, West Temple, North Temple, and East Temple Streets. Streets are named according to their distance and direction from the southeast corner of Temple Square; for example 200 West is two blocks west of this meridian, while 400 South is four blocks south. East Temple was popularly known as Main Street, and was officially renamed sometime in the late 19th century. It has been the commercial center of the city. Main Street and 400 South =Main Street= The early Mormon pioneers, who originally settled in Salt Lake City, adopted a form of consecration whereby crops grown and products produced were divided among members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in local congregations. This enabled new settlers to have the food and products they needed after they made the rigorous journey to Salt Lake City. This exchange was eventually organized into what would become Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI). The first businesses to locate on Main Street were those founded by James A. Livingston and Charles A. Kincade, in 1850, in the area south of the Council House that was being built on the corner of Main and South Temple Streets. The Mormon pioneers lived a very secluded existence in the remote Salt Lake Valley for the first 20 years of settlement. However, in 1865 U.S. troops stationed in Park City discovered silver and announced it to the world. With this announcement, an entirely new element began streaming into Salt Lake City. Prospectors completely changed the downtown district. In accommodation of the new crowd, many of the Main Street businesses were saloons, earning the street the nickname \\"Whiskey Street\\". For many years, there existed a political and cultural divide in Salt Lake City. Mormons would mostly shop and congregate around the Salt Lake Temple, the Gardens at Temple Square and ZCMI on the north-end of Main Street, and those who were not members of the church, who were mostly prospectors in the early days, would stay south of the predominantly Mormon area. Originally, the business district extended along the west side of Main between South Temple and 100 South. By the 1880s, the area had expanded to both sides of the street and down to 200 South, and increased about a block a decade, until 1900, when it reached 400 South. Today, the southern limit of downtown Salt Lake City is usually considered 900 South. =Commercial Street= From 1870 to the 1930s, Commercial Street (Now known as \\"Regent Street\\") was Salt Lake's notorious red light district. Prostitution was begrudgingly tolerated as long as it was confined to Commercial Street, thus kept out of the public eye. In the late 1880s, the trade was unofficially licensed. Police would \\"arrest\\" all of the prostitutes and their madams each month and \\"fine\\" them $50 each. After a physical examination, they would be released and allowed to ply their trade without any further fear of molestation. Many notable Salt Lakers owned buildings on Commercial Street, including the Brigham Young Trust Company, whose board included many prominent members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Brigham Young, Jr., then a church Apostle and vice president of the bank, temporarily resigned over the matter, until the building was later sold. =20th century= North entrance of the now- demolished ZCMI Center Mall After World War II, many people could afford to move out of downtown into the suburbs. By 1971, 60% of the homes in downtown Salt Lake City were in major disrepair. Starting in the 1960s, revitalization efforts began, spearheaded by the LDS Church, who had always considered downtown their home. During the '70s, they built the ZCMI Center Mall on a full city block of land that had previously housed the ZCMI department store, preserving the historic storefront. The Church also leased land to a developer to build Crossroads Mall. The land for the mall originally housed the Amussen Jewelry building (1869), at the time Salt Lake City's oldest building. A study commissioned by the city found it to be Salt Lake City's most architecturally significant building, and efforts to preserve it were underway. However, before the building could be saved, it was torn down to make way for the mall. Also built during this era was the LDS Church Office Building, completed in 1973, which at that time was Salt Lake's tallest building at 28 floors. However, this was surpassed in 1999 by the American Stores Tower (now known as the Wells Fargo Center). Although it has fewer floors, it is taller than the Church Office Building by two feet, although the Church Office Building appears taller because it is located on higher ground. From 1970-1976 the Central Main Street shopping district saw a dramatic shift from the South-end (near Exchange Place and Broadway) to the North-end (near the L.D.S Temple). This shift was the result of a change in buying patterns, with shoppers preferring malls rather than on-street department stores. Using land and a loan provided by Zion Securities, the second Main Street mall was completed in 1978. Following the completion of the Crossroads Mall the South-end of main street collapsed, beginning with 117-year-old merchant Auerbachs Department Store. Others to go under were Broadway Music, Paris Company, Baker Shoes, Pembroke's, Keith O'Brien and Keith Warshaw. In the 1980s, a Saudi businessman, Adnan Khashoggi, had a vision of turning Salt Lake City into a major business hub. Forming a U.S. holdings company, \\"Triad Utah\\", he planned to build two 43-story skyscrapers, as well as several mid-rise buildings. Khashoggi was implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal and his assets were frozen by the Federal government and the skyscrapers were never built, leaving the current Triad Center with only buildings 3, 4 and 5. Revitalization efforts of downtown continued through the 1990s and 2000s. The old Salt Palace arena was torn down and a new arena, Vivint Smart Home Arena, was constructed to the northwest in 1991. The existing convention center connected to the arena was also demolished and a new convention center of the same name was built on the site. In 1998 the Wells Fargo Center was completed and remains the tallest building in Salt Lake City today (although the LDS Church Office Building appears taller because it stands on higher ground). In 2000, the LDS Conference Center was completed and supplanted the still-existing Salt Lake Tabernacle for conferences of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Gateway, which contains office space, apartment complexes, and an open-air shopping center, was completed in 2001 near the western edge of downtown, replacing an old, run-down industrial area near the railroad. LDS Business College as well as the BYU Salt Lake Center moved downtown to the Triad Center, which was also purchased by the LDS Church in 2004. In 2007, the newest high-rise known as the 222 South Main building began construction. The 21 story building was completed in July 2009.  City Creek Center  City Creek Center is a retail, office and residential development constructed on nearly across three blocks in downtown Salt Lake City. Construction completed on March 22, 2012. The project includes nearly of retail space, new and refurbished office towers, new residential buildings, and a full-service grocery store. Crime Pioneer Park, on the western edge of downtown, has developed a reputation as one of the most crime-ridden areas of the state, and also has a high rate of drug dealers. During a six-day crackdown in early November, 2007, 658 people were arrested in and around the park, approximately 70% of all arrests made in the city during that time period in an area that takes up just 1% of Salt Lake City. Pioneer Park was completely renovated in early 2008 following several severe assault incidents.

On 6 November 2004, the remains of an unknown New Zealand soldier were exhumed from the (CWGC) Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, and laid to rest in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Wellington, New Zealand. He represents over 18,000 members of New Zealand forces who lost their lives during the First World War. A special headstone marks his original resting place in Plot 14, Row A, Grave 27. History On 6 November 2004 the remains, in a copper coffin sealed and placed in a rimu coffin brought from New Zealand, were handed over from the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to a New Zealand delegation during a ceremony at Longueval, Somme, France. New Zealand Defence Force chief, Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, who had the task of repatriating the Warrior's remains, said of the occasion \\"I told him [the Warrior] we're taking him home and that those who are taking him home are soldiers, sailors and airmen, past and present. I asked the Warrior to be the guardian of all military personnel who had died on active service. I then promised that we, the people of New Zealand, will be his guardian for ever\\". The Warrior arrived in New Zealand on 10 November 2004. While he lay in state in the Parliament Buildings an estimated 10,000 people paid their respects. The Warrior was laid to rest on the 86th Armistice Day, 11 November 2004, after a service at St Paul's Anglican Cathedral and a 2.85 km slow march procession through the streets of Wellington, lined by about 100,000 people. The Tomb was sealed with a bronze mantel at 3:59pm, bearing the words: The Warrior is one of more than 1500 New Zealanders killed on the Somme. Most of them, 1272, remained unidentified and are buried in unmarked graves or remembered on memorial walls. The remains are thought to include an almost complete skeleton, and other belongings that established beyond doubt the Warrior's nationality. Awards The Warrior was awarded: * 1914–15 Star for service between August 1914 and December 1915 * British War Medal for service during World War I up to 1920 * Victory Medal * 1939–1945 Star for service during World War II * New Zealand Operational Service Medal The Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association also awarded its Badge in Gold, the first time it has been awarded posthumously. Immediate Past National President David Cox, a World War II veteran, made the presentation: Each RNZRSA District President placed soil and other items into the Tomb to acknowledge the service personnel from their districts who had given their lives to the nation, including soil from the farm of Charles Upham. Soil from Caterpillar Valley Cemetery was provided by the Ambassador from France, Jean-Michel Marlaud.

The authors described this as a conservative estimate, because it excluded the extreme statistical outlier data from Fallujah.

The new study applied similar methods and involved surveys between 20 May and 10 July 2006. More households were surveyed, allowing for a 95% confidence interval of 392,979 to 942,636 excess Iraqi deaths. 601,027 deaths (range of 426,369 to 793,663 using a 95% confidence interval) were due to violence. 31% (186,318) of those were attributed to the US-led Coalition, 24% (144,246) to others, and 46% (276,472) unknown. The causes of violent deaths were gunshot (56% or 336,575), car bomb (13% or 78,133), other explosion/ordnance (14%), air strike (13% or 78,133), accident (2% or 12,020), and unknown (2%). The mortality estimates in the Lancet surveys are higher than in several other reports, including those of the Iraqi Health Ministry and the United Nations, as well as other household surveys such as the Iraq Living Conditions Survey and the Iraq Family Health Survey. The 2007 ORB survey of Iraq War casualties estimated more deaths than the Lancet, though it covered a longer period of the conflict.\\"Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate\\" By Michael Spagat and Josh Dougherty The Lancet surveys have triggered criticism and disbelief from some journalists, governments, the Iraq Body Count project, some epidemiologists and statisticians and others, but have also been supported by some journalists, governments, epidemiologists and statisticians.  First study (2004)  The survey was sponsored by the Center for International Emergency Disaster and Refugee Studies, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States (authors L Roberts PhD, G Burnham MD) and the Department of Community Medicine, College of Medicine, Al-Mustansiriya University, Baghdad, Iraq. Roberts' team was chosen for their experience in estimating total mortality in war zones, for example his estimate of 1.7 million deaths due to the war in the Congo which not only met with widespread acceptance and no challenge when published in 2000,IRC  Mortality Study, Eastern D.R. Congo (April-May 2000) but resulted and was cited in a U.N. Security Council resolution that all foreign armies must leave Congo, a United Nations request for $140 million in aid, and the US State Department pledging an additional $10 million in aid. Similar studies have been accepted uncritically as estimates of wartime mortality in Darfur and Bosnia. Roberts' regular technique is to estimate total mortality by personal surveys of a sample of the households in the area under study; this method being chosen in order to avoid the under-counting inherent in using only reported deaths in areas so chaotic that many deaths are unreported, and to include those deaths not directly attributable to violence but nevertheless the result of the conflict through indirect means, such as contamination of water supply or unavailability of medical care. The baseline mortality rate calculated from the interviewees' reports for the period prior to the conflict is subtracted from that reported during the conflict, to estimate the excess mortality which may be attributed to the presence of the conflict, directly or indirectly. This technique has been accepted uncritically in the previous mortality surveys discussed above. Because of the impracticality of carrying out an evenly distributed survey, particularly during a war, Roberts' surveys use \\"cluster sampling\\", dividing the area into a number of randomly selected, approximately equally populated regions; a random point is chosen within each region, and a fixed number of the households closest to that point are surveyed as a \\"cluster\\". While not as accurate as an evenly distributed survey of the same number of households, this technique is more accurate than merely surveying one household for each selected point. In his study of Iraq, Roberts divided the country into 33 regions, attempting to sample 30 households for each cluster, and selecting 988 households, with 7868 residents. In September 2004, each surveyed household was interviewed about household composition, births, and deaths since January 2002. Of 78 households where members were asked to show documentation to confirm their claims after the interview was finished, 63 were able to present death certificates. According to the authors, 5 (0.5%) of the 988 households that were randomly chosen to be surveyed refused to be interviewed. The relative risk of death due to the 2003 invasion and occupation was estimated by comparing mortality in the 17.8 months after the invasion with the 14.6 months preceding it. The authors stated, \\"Making conservative assumptions, we think that about 100,000 excess deaths, or more have happened since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\\" Among such \\"conservative assumptions\\" is the exclusion of data from Fallujah in many of its findings. Since interpreting the results of the study would be complicated by the inclusion of an outlier cluster in Fallujah, where heavy fighting caused far more casualties than elsewhere in Iraq, the study focused mainly on the results that excluded the Fallujah cluster. While the authors argued that the Fallujah cluster's inclusion could be justified as a normal part of the sampling strategy (the authors noted that other \\"hotspots\\" like Najaf had not ended up being surveyed), and the authors presented two sets of results in some cases (one set including the Fallujah data and one not), the article, and most press coverage of the article, stresses the data that excluded the Fallujah cluster. The main debate in the media in the U.S. and UK focused on whether 98,000 (95% CI 8000–194,000) more Iraqis died as a result of coalition intervention, calculated from their estimate of an increased mortality of 1.5 times (95% CI 1.1-2.3) the prewar rate (excluding the Fallujah data). Had the Fallujah sample been included, the survey's estimate that mortality rates had increased about 2.5 times since the invasion (with a 95% CI 1.6-4.2) including the Fallujah data would have resulted in an excess of about 298,000 deaths (95% CI ?-?), with 200,000 concentrated in the 3% of Iraq around Fallujah (Roberts et al. p. 5). According to the article, violence was responsible for most of the extra deaths whether or not the Fallujah data was excluded. Coalition airstrikes would be the main cause of these violent deaths if Fallujah data were included. The study concluded that: \\"Violent deaths were widespread, reported in 15 of 33 clusters, and were mainly attributed to coalition forces.\\" and \\"Violence accounted for most of the excess deaths and air strikes from coalition forces accounted for most violent deaths.\\" The study estimates that the risk of death specifically from violence in Iraq during the period after the invasion was approximately 58 times higher than in the period before the war, with the CI95 being 8.1-419, meaning that there is a 97.5% chance that the risk of death from violence after the invasion is at least 8.1 times higher than it was before. Newsday reported: > The most common causes of death before the invasion of Iraq were heart > attacks, strokes and other chronic diseases. However, after the invasion, > violence was recorded as the primary cause of death and was mainly > attributed to coalition forces—with about 95 percent of those deaths caused > by bombs or fire from helicopter gunships. = Criticisms and countercriticisms = Some criticisms have focused on the relatively broad 95% confidence intervals (CI95), resulting from the difficulty and scarcity of reliable sources.\\"100,000 Dead—or 8,000.

Not one of them took issue with the study's methods or its conclusions. If anything, the scientists told me, the authors had been cautious in their estimates. With a quick call to a statistician, reporters would have found that the probability forms a bell curve — the likelihood is very small that the number of deaths fell at either extreme of the range. It was very likely to fall near the middle.\\"\\"Dead Iraqis. Why an Estimate was Ignored\\" . By Lila Guterman, Columbia Journalism Review, March/April 2005. A Ministerial Statement written 17 November 2004, by the UK government stated \\"the Government does not accept its [the study's] central conclusion\\", because they were apparently inconsistent with figures published by the Iraq Ministry of Health, based on figures collected by hospitals, which said that \\"between 5 April 2004 and 5 October 2004, 3,853 civilians were killed and 15,517 were injured\\". Some critics have said that The Lancet study authors were unable to visit certain randomly selected sample areas. In an interview on the radio program \\"This American Life\\" however, the authors of the study say that they never substituted different, more accessible, areas, and that every place that was randomly selected at the beginning of the study was surveyed in full, despite the risk of death to the surveyors. Critics of the Lancet study have pointed out other difficulties in obtaining accurate statistics in a war zone. The authors of the study readily acknowledge this point and note the problems in the paper; for example they state that \\"there can be a dramatic clustering of deaths in wars where many die from bombings\\". They also said that the data their projections were based on were of \\"limited precision\\" because the quality of the information depended on the accuracy of the household interviews used for the study.ABC News: ABC News The results of the study were politically sensitive, since a heavy death toll could raise questions regarding the humanitarian justifications on the eve of a contested US presidential election. Critics objected to the timing of the report, claiming it was hastily prepared and published despite what they perceived as its poor quality in order to sway the U.S. electorate. On this topic, Les Roberts stated \\"I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive in doing that was not to skew the election. My motive was that if this came out during the campaign, both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq. I was opposed to the war and I still think that the war was a bad idea, but I think that our science has transcended our perspectives.\\" = Lancet publications related to criticisms = * 20 November 2004.

Response by Les Roberts et al. to Apfelroth. Acknowledges flaws, but says \\"the key public-health findings of this study are robust despite this imprecision. These findings include: a higher death rate after the invasion; a 58-fold increase in death from violence, making it the main cause of death; and most violent deaths being caused by air-strikes from Coalition Forces. Whether the true death toll is 90000 or 150000, these three findings give ample guidance towards understanding what must happen to reduce civilian deaths. ... Before publication, the article was critically reviewed by many leading authorities in statistics and public health and their suggestions were incorporated into the paper. The death toll estimated by our study is indeed imprecise, and those interested in international law and historical records should not be content with our study. We encourage Apfelroth and others to improve on our efforts. In the interim, we feel this study, as well as the only other published sample survey we know of on the subject, point to violence from the Coalition Forces as the main cause of death and remind us that the number of Iraqi deaths is certainly many times higher than reported by passive surveillance methods or in press accounts.\\" = Other responses to criticism = The Chronicle of Higher Education also wrote an article discussing the differences in the survey's reception in the popular press over how it was received in the scientific community. Epidemiologist Klim McPherson writes in the 12 March 2005 British Medical Journal: \\"The government rejected this survey and its estimates as unreliable; in part absurdly because statistical extrapolation from samples was thought invalid. Imprecise they are, but to a known extent. These are unique estimates from a dispassionate survey conducted in the most dangerous of epidemiological conditions. Hence the estimates, as far as they can go, are unlikely to be biased, even allowing for the reinstatement of Falluja. To confuse imprecision with bias is unjustified.\\"  Second study (2006)  A second study by some of the same authors was published in October 2006, in The Lancet.\\"Critics say 600,000 Iraqi dead doesn't tally.

The Lancet authors based their calculations on an overall, post-invasion, excess mortality rate of 7.8/1000/year. \\"Pre-invasion mortality rates were 5.5 per 1000 people per year (95% CI 4.3–7.1), compared with 13.3 per 1000 people per year (10.9–16.1) in the 40 months post-invasion.\\" See Table 3 in the Lancet article. The population number used in the calculation is reported in the Lancet supplement: \\"Mortality projections were applied to the 2004 mid- year population estimates (26,112,353) of the surveyed areas (which exclude the governorates of Muthanna and Dahuk, which had been omitted through misattribution) to establish the mortality projections.\\" Of 629 deaths verified and recorded among a sample of 1,849 households incorporating some 12,801 people at the time of the survey, 13% took place in the 14 months before the invasion and 87% in the 40 months afterwards. \\"The study population at the beginning of the recall period (January 1, 2002) was calculated to be 11 956, and a total of 1474 births and 629 deaths were reported during the study period.\\" The study concluded that the mortality rate per 1,000 population per year in the pre-invasion period was 5.5 (range of 4.3-7.1, using a 95% CI, confidence interval) and in the post-invasion period was 13.3 (95% CI, 10.9-16.1). Excess mortality rate over the pre-invasion period was therefore 7.8 per 1,000 population per year, with violent death accounting for 92% of the increased mortality rate. Washington Post: \\"Gunshot wounds caused 56 percent of violent deaths, with car bombs and other explosions causing 14 percent, according to the survey results. Of the violent deaths that occurred after the invasion, 31 percent were caused by coalition forces or airstrikes, the respondents said.\\" The study results show an increasing mortality rate throughout the post-invasion periods, with the excess mortality rate for June 2005-June 2006 of 14.2 (95% CI, 8.6-21.5) being nearly 5.5 times the excess mortality rate for March 2003-April 2004 of 2.6 (95% CI, 0.6-4.7). The 2006 study also provides an estimate for the 18-month period following the invasion (March 2003 through September 2004) of 112,000 deaths (95% CI, 69,000-155,000). The authors conclude, \\"Thus, the data presented here validates our 2004 study, which conservatively estimated an excess mortality of nearly 100,000 as of September, 2004.\\" The authors described the fact that their estimate is over ten times higher than other estimates, such as the Iraq Body Count project (IBC) estimate and U.S. Department of Defense estimates, as \\"not unexpected\\", stating that this is a common occurrence in conflict situations. They stated, \\"Aside from Bosnia, we can find no conflict situation where passive surveillance recorded more than 20% of the deaths measured by population-based methods. In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates. Between 1960 and 1990, newspaper accounts of political deaths in Guatemala correctly reported over 50% of deaths in years of low violence but less than 5% in years of highest violence.\\" = Official reactions = An 12 October 2006 San Francisco Chronicle article reported: > \\"Six hundred thousand or whatever they guessed at is just, it's not > credible,\\" Bush said, and he dismissed the methodology as \\"pretty well > discredited.\\" In December [2005], Bush estimated that 30,000 Iraqis had died > in the war.

In doing so, it did not mention the advice of the Ministry of Defence's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Roy Anderson, who had called the study \\"robust\\" and its claimed methods \\"close to 'best practice' in this area, given the difficulties of data collection and verification in the present circumstances in Iraq\\", in an internal memo on the day the study was published, dated 13 October 2006. *Ministers were told not to rubbish Iraq deaths study Guardian Unlimited, 26 March 2007 *Counting the cost by Richard Horton, 27 March 2007 = Criticisms = The Iraq Body Count project (IBC), who compiles a database of reported civilian deaths, has criticised the Lancet's estimate of 601,000 violent deaths\\"Reality checks: some responses to the latest Lancet estimates\\". By Hamit Dardagan, John Sloboda, and Josh Dougherty. Iraq Body Count project. 16 October 2006. out of the Lancet estimate of 654,965 total excess deaths related to the war. An October 2006 article by IBC argues that the Lancet estimate is suspect \\"because of a very different conclusion reached by another random household survey, the Iraq Living Conditions Survey 2004 (ILCS), using a comparable method but a considerably better-distributed and much larger sample.\\" IBC also enumerates several \\"shocking implications\\" which would be true if the Lancet report were accurate, e.g. \\"Half a million death certificates were received by families which were never officially recorded as having been issued\\" and claims that these \\"extreme and improbable implications\\" and \\"utter failure of local or external agencies to notice and respond to a decimation of the adult male population in key urban areas\\" are some of several reasons why they doubt the study's estimates. IBC states that these consequences would constitute \\"extreme notions\\". Later statements in a 2010 article by IBC say that the \\"hugely exaggerated death toll figures\\" from the 2006 Lancet report have \\"been comprehensively discredited\\" by recently published research. Jon Pedersen of the Fafo Institute and research director for the ILCS survey, which estimated approximately 24,000 (95% CI 18,000-29,000) war-related deaths in Iraq up to April 2004, expressed reservations about the low pre-war mortality rate used in the Lancet study and about the ability of its authors to oversee the interviews properly as they were conducted throughout Iraq. Pedersen has been quoted saying he thinks the Lancet numbers are \\"high, and probably way too high. I would accept something in the vicinity of 100,000 but 600,000 is too much.\\" Debarati Guha-Sapir, director of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels, was quoted in an interview for Nature.com saying that Burnham's team have published \\"inflated\\" numbers that \\"discredit\\" the process of estimating death counts. \\"Why are they doing this?\\" she asks. \\"It's because of the elections.\\". However, another interviewer a week later paints a more measured picture of her criticisms: \\"She has some methodological concerns about the paper, including the use of local people — who might have opposed the occupation — as interviewers. She also points out that the result does not fit with any she has recorded in 15 years of studying conflict zones. Even in Darfur, where armed groups have wiped out whole villages, she says that researchers have not recorded the 500 violent deaths per day that the Johns Hopkins team estimates are occurring in Iraq. But overall Guha-Sapir says the paper contains the best data yet on the mortality rate in Iraq.\\" A subsequent article co-authored by Guha-Sapir and Olivier Degomme for CRED reviews the Lancet data in detail. It concludes that The Lancet overestimated deaths and that the war-related death toll was most likely to be around 125,000 for the period covered by the Lancet study, reaching its conclusions by correcting errors in the 2006 Lancet estimate and triangulating with data from IBC and ILCS. Beth Osborne Daponte, a demographer known for producing death estimates for the first Gulf War, evaluates the Lancet survey and other sources in a paper for the International Review of the Red Cross. Among other criticisms, Daponte questions the reliability of pre-war estimates used in the Lancet study to derive its \\"excess deaths\\" estimate, and the ethical approval for the survey. She concludes that the most reliable information available to date is provided by the Iraq Family Health Survey, the Iraq Living Conditions Survey and Iraq Body Count. Borzou Daragahi Iraq correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, in an interview with PBS, questioned the study based on their earlier research in Iraq, saying, \\"Well, we think—the Los Angeles Times thinks these numbers are too large, depending on the extensive research we've done. Earlier this year, around June, the report was published at least in June, but the reporting was done over weeks earlier. We went to morgues, cemeteries, hospitals, health officials, and we gathered as many statistics as we could on the actual dead bodies, and the number we came up with around June was about at least 50,000. And that kind of jibed with some of the news report that were out there, the accumulation of news reports, in terms of the numbers killed. The U.N. says that there's about 3,000 a month being killed; that also fits in with our numbers and with morgue numbers. This number of 600,000 or more killed since the beginning of the war, it's way off our charts.\\" The October 2006 Lancet estimate also drew criticism from the Iraqi government. Government spokesman Ali Debbagh said, \\"This figure, which in reality has no basis, is exaggerated\\". Iraq's Health Minister Ali al-Shemari gave a similar view in November 2006: \\"Since three and a half years, since the change of the Saddam regime, some people say we have 600,000 are killed. This is an exaggerated number. I think 150 is OK.\\"\\"Iraqi official estimates at least 150,000 Iraqis killed by insurgents\\" . 9 November 2006. Associated Press. A 2010 paper by Professor Michael Spagat entitled \\"Ethical and Data-Integrity Problems in the Second Lancet Survey of Mortality in Iraq\\" was published in the peer reviewed journal Defense & Peace Economics. This paper argues that there were several \\"ethical violations to the survey's respondents\\", faults the study authors for \\"non-disclosure of the survey's questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design\\", and presents \\"evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification, which falls into nine broad categories.\\" The paper concludes that the Lancet survey, \\"cannot be considered a reliable or valid contribution towards knowledge about the extent of mortality in Iraq since 2003.\\" = AAPOR investigation of the 2nd Lancet survey = On 3 February 2009, the Executive Council of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) announced that an 8-month investigation found the author of the 2006 Lancet survey, Dr. Gilbert Burnham, had violated the Association's Code of Professional Ethics & Practices for repeatedly refusing to disclose essential facts about his research. \\"Dr. Burnham provided only partial information and explicitly refused to provide complete information about the basic elements of his research,\\" said Mary Losch, chair of the association's Standards Committee.\\"Nondisclosure Cited in Iraq Casualties Study\\".

The above-mentioned U.N. \\"pre-invasion mortality rate\\" of 9 deaths/1,000/year is more than either the 2002 or 2003 mortality rates measured by both Lancet studies. Even though the 2004 and 2006 Lancet studies interviewed different sets of households across Iraq, they came up with the same 2002 pre-war mortality rate. From the 2006 Lancet article: \\"The striking similarity between the 2004 and 2006 estimates of pre-war mortality diminishes concerns about people's ability to recall deaths accurately over a 4-year period.\\" Here is an excerpt from the supplement to the 2006 Lancet study: > For the purpose of analysis, the 40 months of survey data were divided into > three equal periods—March 2003 to April 2004; May 2004 to May 2005, and June > 2005 to June 2006.

Table 3 in the Lancet article lists those rates as 2.6, 5.6, and 14.2. Why the excess mortality rate for June 2005 to June 2006 is listed as 14.2 instead of 14.3 May be due to how rounding was done. The overall excess mortality rate for the whole post-invasion survey period is listed as 7.8 deaths/1000/year in Table 3. The difference between the Lancet and U.N. pre- invasion mortality rates is 3.5 deaths/1,000/year. The Lancet study used the number of 26,112,353 (from Lancet supplement) as the population of Iraq. 3.5 times 26,112 equals 91,392. So 3.5 deaths/1,000/year means around 91,400 deaths in one year in a population of 26.1 million. = Infant and child death rates = In a 5 March 2007 article\\"Could 650,000 Iraqis really have died because of the invasion?\\".

The 2000 BBC article reported that after the UN sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, \\"They found that in south and central Iraq, infant mortality had risen to 108 per 1,000 between 1994 and 1999, while child mortality — covering those between one and five years — rocketed from 56 to 131 per 1,000.\\" The 2000 BBC article also reported, \\"However, it found that infant and child mortality in the autonomous, mainly Kurd region in the North of the country, has actually fallen, perhaps reflecting the more favourable distribution of aid in that area.\\" UN-sponsored studies taken after 2003 revealed that the previous childhood mortality figures for South/Central Iraq (supplied by Saddam's government) were inflated by more than a factor of two and that the childhood mortality rate in those regions was even lower than the rate in northern Iraq. The UN sanctions ended on 22 May 2003 (with certain arms-related exceptions). = 40 houses surveyed per day = Madelyn Hicks, a psychiatrist and public health researcher at King's College London in the UK, says she \\"simply cannot believe\\" the paper's claim that 40 consecutive houses were surveyed in a single day. \\"There is simply not enough time in the day,\\" she says, \\"so I have to conclude that something else is going on for at least some of these interviews.\\" Households may have been \\"prepared by someone, made ready for rapid reporting,\\" she says, which \\"raises the issue of bias being introduced.\\" An 24 October 2006 The Guardian article reports this response from Lancet study author Gilbert Burnham: > Others had suggested that it was impossible for 40 households to be surveyed > in one day — but in fact the researchers were split into two teams and > conducted 20 household interviews each, he said.

BBC. = Death Certificates = Of the 1849 households that completed the survey there were reports of 629 deaths during the study period from 1 January 2002 through June 2006. The Lancet study claims that, \\"Survey teams asked for death certificates in 545 (87%) reported deaths and these were present in 501 cases. The pattern of deaths in households without death certificates was no different from those with certificates.\\" So, 92% of those asked for death certificates produced them. In an interview in April 2007 Lancet study author Les Roberts reported that, \\"90 percent of the people we interviewed had death certificates. We're quite sure they didn't make these deaths up.\\"\\"A moment with ... Dr. Les Roberts, political scientist\\". By Tom Paulson. 20 April 2007. Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees described death certificate procedures of the Ministry of Health (MoH) as follows: > Death certificates, which are needed in order to obtain retirement benefits > for a person's surviving spouse or children, as well as for inheritance > purposes, are issued by the MoH Births/Deaths Administrative Offices which > are located in Public Hospitals.

In October 2006 Middle East Professor Juan Cole supported the Lancet findings, noting that Iraqis often bury their dead on the same day, and thus don't require a death certificate, and also may not report it for fear of reprisals by militias: > Although there are benefits to registering with the government for a death > certificate, there are also disadvantages.

By Middle Eastern Professor Juan Cole. October 11, 2006. In a peer-reviewed paper on the Lancet survey, economist Michael Spagat examined the death certificate data. He noted that the very high reported rate of death certificates by the survey \\"implies that the official death certificate system has issued, but failed to record the issuance of, about 500,000 death certificates\\", and notes that the rate of confirmations claimed by the second survey is substantially higher than the rate found in the first survey, despite covering a longer period, and calculates the odds against this to be very high. Spagat further notes several \\"unlikely patterns in the confirmations of violent deaths through the viewing of death certificates and in the patterns of when death certificates were requested and when they were not requested.\\" His analysis concludes that \\"there is likely fabrication in the death-certificate data\\" and that \\"these data do not give reliable support to [the Lancet survey's] very high estimated death rate.\\" = Main street bias = The research team of Professors Neil Johnson, Sean Gourley and J.P. Onella of the physics department at Oxford University, Professor Michael Spagat of the economics department of Royal Holloway, University of London, and Professor Gesine Reinert of the statistics department at Oxford University, claimed the methodology of the study was fundamentally flawed by what they term \\"main street bias\\". They claimed the sampling methods used \\"will result in an over-estimation of the death toll in Iraq\\" because \\"by sampling only cross streets which are more accessible, you get an over-estimation of deaths.\\"\\"UK scientists attack Lancet study over death toll\\". By Sarah Boseley. 24 October 2006. The Guardian.\\"Lancet Iraq Study Flawed: Death Toll Too High\\". By Sean Gourley, Neil Johnson, and Michael Spagat. 20 October 2006. Scoop These professors have published a detailed paper discussing this bias and the Lancet study called \\"Conflict Mortality Surveys\\".Conflict Mortality Surveys . Department of Economics, Royal Holloway, University of London. An 24 October 2006 The Guardian article reported this response from a Lancet study author: > But Prof Burnham said the researchers penetrated much further into > residential areas than was clear from the Lancet paper. The notion 'that we > avoided back alleys was totally untrue'. He added that 28% of households > were in rural areas — which matches the population spread. An article in Science magazine by John Bohannon describes some of the criticisms, as well as some responses from the Lancet report's lead author Gilbert Burnham. According to Bohannon and Johnson, the Lancet paper indicates that the survey team avoided small back alleys for safety reasons. But this could bias the data because deaths from car bombs, street-market explosions, and shootings from vehicles should be more likely on larger streets. Burnham counters that such streets were included and that the methods section of the published Lancet paper is oversimplified. Bohannon also alleged that Burnham told Science that he does not know exactly how the Iraqi team conducted its survey; the details about neighbourhoods surveyed were destroyed \\"in case they fell into the wrong hands and could increase the risks to residents.\\" These explanations have infuriated the study's critics. Michael Spagat, who specialises in civil conflicts, says the scientific community should call for an in-depth investigation into the researchers' procedures. \\"It is almost a crime to let it go unchallenged,\\" adds Johnson. In a 24 November 2006 letter to Science, the authors of the Lancet report claimed that Bohannon misquoted Burnham, stating that \\"in no place does our Lancet paper say that the survey team avoided small back alleys\\", and that \\"The methods section of the paper was modified with the suggestions of peer reviewers and the editorial staff. At no time did Burnham describe it to Bohannon as 'oversimplified'.\\" Bohannon defended his comments as accurate, citing Burnham saying, in response to questions about why details of selecting \\"residential streets that did not cross the main avenues\\", that \\"in trying to shorten the paper from its original very large size, this bit got chopped, unfortunately.\\" In addition, the details which were destroyed refer to the \\"scraps\\" of paper on which streets and addresses were written to \\"randomly\\" choose households. The data set is now being selectively released.\\"Release of Data from the 2006 Iraq Mortality Study\\" . Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The authors of the main street bias critique published a formal paper on this idea in the Journal of Peace Research. This paper subsequently won the journal's 2008 Article of the Year award. The jury states that the article \\"provides an important advance in the methodology for estimating the number of casualties in civil wars,\\" and that, \\"the authors show convincingly that previous studies which are based on a cross-street cluster-sampling algorithm (CSSA) have significantly overestimated the number of casualties in Iraq.\\" The authors have also published a follow-up paper in Europhysics Letters which provides a generic framework than can be used to assess sampling bias in certain social and biological systems. A special case of the framework can be used to derive the results presented in their Journal of Peace Research paper. The authors also investigate the sensitivity of their results to the underlying model parameter values. They reiterate their view that a more precise determination of the model parameters and, hence, the extent of sampling bias, is possible only if the actual micro-level data of the Lancet study are released. = Criticism of graph = Figure 4 from the second The Lancet survey of Iraqi mortality, showing a comparison with two other mortality estimates. Two letters subsequently published in the Lancet journal challenged this graph as erroneous and misleading, and the authors of the study conceded these problems, saying that they intended to illustrate their similar escalation. Figure 4 from the October 2006 Lancet survey of Iraq War mortality, showing a comparison of 3 mortality estimates. Two letters subsequently published in the Lancet journal challenged this graph. The purpose of the graph in the Lancet article is in \\"monitoring trends over time,\\" which show increased deaths from 3 mortality different mortality estimates. Results from other studies track results from the Lancet surveys. The graph states, \\"the similar patterns of mortality over time documented in our survey and by other sources corroborate our findings about the trends in mortality over time.\\" The graph shows that the IBC and DoD data document the rise in cumulative deaths over time (plotted along the \\"Deaths\\" axis on the left). Rates for the Lancet are plotted independently using the \\"Deaths per 1,000 per year\\" axis on the right. A letter by Debarati Guha-Sapir, Olivier Degomme and Jon Pedersen argues: \\"Burnham and colleagues' figure 4, in which cumulated Iraq Body Count deaths parallel their study's mortality rates, is misleading. Rates cannot be compared with numbers, much less with cumulative numbers.\\" A second letter by Josh Dougherty argues that the DoD figure is misrepresented: \\"Burnham and colleagues' assertion that the DoD 'estimated the civilian casualty rate at 117 deaths per day' is mistaken, as is their figure 4, which repeats this error in graphic form. These data refer to Iraqi civilians and security-force personnel, not just to civilians, and to casualties (ie, deaths or injuries), not just deaths.\\" The Lancet authors replied, \\"Josh Dougherty and Debarati Guha-Sapir and colleagues all point out that figure 4 of our report mixes rates and counts, creating a confusing image. We find this criticism valid and accept this as an error on our part. Moreover, Dougherty rightly points out that the data in the US Department of Defense source were casualties, not deaths alone... We wanted to show that the three sources all similarly pointed to an escalating conflict.\\" = More responses to criticisms = In a Democracy Now! interview, study co-author Les Roberts defended the methodology by noting that the method is the standard used in poor countries. He also said that the same method was used by the US government following wars in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Roberts also said that the US government's Smart Initiative program is spending millions of dollars per year teaching NGOs and UN workers how to use the same cluster method for estimating mortality rates. The article's authors defended their research, claiming that their work was the only active study of the death toll, and that this is more accurate than passively counting reported deaths. They cited a number of factors that could lead to smaller figures from other sources; for example, the Islamic requirement that bodies be buried within 24 hours of death. They claim that the sources of bias in their study push the figure down. An 11 October 2006 Washington Post article reports: :Ronald Waldman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for many years, called the survey method \\"tried and true,\\" and added that \\"this is the best estimate of mortality we have.\\" In a letter to The Age, published on 21 October 2006, 27 epidemiologists and health professionals defended the methods of the study, writing that the study's \\"methodology is sound and its conclusions should be taken seriously.\\"\\"The Iraq deaths study was valid and correct\\", The Age, 21 October 2006 A Reuters article reports on other researchers, epidemiologists, professors, and physicians who have defended the study.

United Nations Development Programme Iraq Living Conditions Survey. The Iraq Body Count project (IBC) records civilian deaths reported by English-language media, including all civilian deaths due to coalition military action, the insurgency or increased criminal violence.About the Iraq Body Count project. The IBC site states: \\"many deaths will likely go unreported or unrecorded by officials and media.\\"Iraq Body Count project. Source of IBC quote on undercounting by media is here . The IBC death count at the time of the October 2006 Lancet study was released was between 43,546 and 48,343, or roughly 7% of the estimate in the Lancet study. Besides the admitted IBC undercount due to its media reliance, some of the difference between the Lancet and IBC estimates is explained by the fact that the Lancet study was estimating all \\"excess\\" deaths from any and all violent and nonviolent causes, and includes combatants and civilians alike. However, IBC believes some of it may also be explained by the Lancet having overestimated, citing the lower estimate from the UNDP's 2004 Iraq Living Conditions Survey (ILCS). IBC illustrated several of what it calls \\"the main data that are relevant to a comparative assessment of\\" the ILCS study and the 2004 Lancet study. It points to, for example, a much larger number of clusters (2,200 for ILCS vs. 33 for Lancet), and a more accurate sampling rate (1 in 200 for ILCS vs. 1 in 3,000 for Lancet).\\"Speculation is no substitute: a defence of Iraq Body Count\\". April 2006. By Hamit Dardagan, John Sloboda, and Josh Dougherty. Iraq Body Count project. The 2006 Lancet study is somewhat larger than the first (it used 47 clusters instead of 33, and had a lower sampling rate). The 2004 Lancet study surveyed 988 households, and the 2006 Lancet study surveyed 1849 households. The ILCS study surveyed 22,000 households. Lancet authors draw a different kind of comparison. From Appendix C of the 2006 Lancet study supplement there is this concerning the ILCS study: > Working for the U.N. Development Program [UNDP], the highly regarded > Norwegian researcher Jon Pederson led a survey that recorded between 18,000 > and 29,000 violent deaths during the first year of occupation. The survey > was not focused on deaths, but asked about them over the course of lengthy > interviews that focused on access to services.

The surveys reported in The Lancet were > focused solely on recording deaths and count about two and a half times as > many excess deaths from all causes over the same period. In an 30 October 2006 BBC article Lancet study author Les Roberts compares the number of violent deaths found in the UNDP survey and in the 2 Lancet surveys through the first year after the invasion (by April 2004): > This UNDP survey covered about 13 months after the invasion. Our first > survey recorded almost twice as many violent deaths from the 13th to the > 18th months after the invasion as it did during the first 12. The second > survey found an excess rate of 2.6/1000/year over the same period > corresponding to approximately 70,000 deaths by April 2004. Thus, the rates > of violent death recorded in the two survey groups are not so divergent. The ILCS asked about deaths during the course of a lengthy interview on the household's living conditions. In the 3 main ILCS documents (in pdf form) all the war-related deaths info is in 6 paragraphs on page 54 of the analytical report. It states: > The ILCS data has been derived from a question posed to households > concerning missing and dead persons during the two years prior to the > survey. Although the date was not asked for, it is reasonable to suppose > that the vast majority of deaths due to warfare occurred after the beginning > of 2003.  Iraq Body Count project compared to Lancet studies  Besides the comparisons made in various publications, and in previous sections here, there are also more comparisons and criticisms of both studies in the relevant sections of the above-linked articles. In particular see the \\"Undercounting\\" section at Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 which lists many examples of how the media, hospitals, morgues, government, etc. miss some of the deaths caused by the war.  ORB survey compared with Lancet studies  On 14 September 2007, ORB (Opinion Research Business), an independent UK based polling agency, published an estimate of the total casualties of the Iraq war. The figure suggested by ORB, which was based on survey responses from 1,499 adults, stands at 1,220,580 deaths, with a margin of error of 2.5%. This estimate, although conducted independently, and using a different polling methodology, is consistent with the Lancet findings if accounting for the additional 14 months covered by the ORB poll.\\"UK Poll Consistent with 1 Million Extrapolation of Lancet Death Toll\\". By Robert Naiman (Just Foreign Policy). 14 September 2007. Huffington Post. On 28 January 2008, ORB published an update based on additional work carried out in rural areas of Iraq. Some 600 additional interviews were undertaken and as a result of this the death estimate was revised to 1,033,000 with a given range of 946,000 to 1,120,000.Update on Iraqi Casualty Data by Opinion Research Business, January 2008. This ORB poll estimate came under criticism in a peer reviewed paper called \\"Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate\\", published in the journal Survey Research Methods. This paper \\"finds fundamental flaws in the data underpinning ORB's estimate\\", and concludes that the ORB data \\"are not suitable for deriving any credible estimate but, given proper scrutiny, it is clear that ORB has overestimated by a wide margin.\\"\\"Study reveals fundamental flaws to 2007 estimate of one million Iraqis killed\\" Royal Holloway University of London  Iraq Family Health Survey compared with Lancet studies  The \\"Iraq Family Health Survey\\" published in the New England Journal of Medicine surveyed 9,345 households across Iraq and estimated 151,000 deaths due to violence (95% uncertainty range, 104,000 to 223,000) over the same period covered in the second Lancet survey by Burnham et al.\\"New study estimates 151 000 violent Iraqi deaths since 2003 invasion\\". 9 January 2008 news release. World Health Organization. See right sidebar for related links. The NEJM article stated that the second Lancet survey \\"considerably overestimated the number of violent deaths\\" and said the Lancet results were, \\"highly improbable, given the internal and external consistency of the data and the much larger sample size and quality- control measures taken in the implementation of the IFHS.\\" The figures provided by this survey on the total violent deaths in Iraq, are lower than Lancets estimate by a factor of roughly 4. However, despite the differences, Lancet co-author Les Roberts said there were a few underlying similarities as well, such as a doubling of mortality rate after the invasion of Iraq in the study, compared to the 2.4-fold increase reported by Lancet. It has been estimated by Roberts that the \\"excess death\\" toll in the IFHS survey would be about 400,000, which he says, puts these figures in league with Lancet's. Roberts says the discrepancy between the two studies arise with Lancet attributing most of the post-war excess deaths to violence, while only one- third of the excess deaths would be due to violence in the IFHS.\\"Lancet Study Author Assesses New Report on Iraqi Death Toll\\" . 11 January 2008. Institute for Public Accuracy. See: Iraq Family Health Survey#400,000 The authors of the IFHS report have disputed this conclusion, saying, \\"The excess deaths reported by Burnham et al. included only 8.2% of deaths from nonviolent causes, so inclusion of these deaths will not increase the agreement between the estimates from the IFHS and Burnham et al.\\" They defended the results of their survey saying, \\"It is unlikely that a small survey with only 47 clusters has provided a more accurate estimate of violence-related mortality than a much larger survey sampling of 971 clusters.\\"  See also  *Casualties of the Iraq War.

Dutch roll is a type of aircraft motion, consisting of an out-of-phase combination of \\"tail-wagging\\" (yaw) and rocking from side to side (roll). This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include phugoid, short period, and spiral divergence). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. Wings placed well above the center of gravity, sweepback (swept wings) and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers. A similar phenomenon can happen in a trailer pulled by a car. Stability In aircraft design, Dutch roll results from relatively weaker positive directional stability as opposed to positive lateral stability. When an aircraft rolls around the longitudinal axis, a sideslip is introduced into the relative wind in the direction of the rolling motion. Strong lateral stability begins to restore the aircraft to level flight. At the same time, somewhat weaker directional stability attempts to correct the sideslip by aligning the aircraft with the perceived relative wind. Since directional stability is weaker than lateral stability for the particular aircraft, the restoring yaw motion lags significantly behind the restoring roll motion. The aircraft passes through level flight as the yawing motion is continuing in the direction of the original roll. At that point, the sideslip is introduced in the opposite direction and the process is reversed. Mechanism The most common mechanism of Dutch roll occurrence is a moment of yawing motion which can be caused by any number of factors. As a swept-wing aircraft yaws (to the right, for instance), the left wing becomes less-swept than the right wing in reference to the relative wind. Because of this, the left wing develops more lift than the right wing causing the aircraft to roll to the right. This motion continues until the yaw angle of the aircraft reaches the point where the vertical stabilizer effectively becomes a wind vane and reverses the yawing motion. As the aircraft yaws back to the left, the right wing then becomes less swept than the left resulting in the right wing developing more lift than the left. The aircraft then rolls to the left as the yaw angle again reaches the point where the aircraft wind-vanes back the other direction and the whole process repeats itself. The average duration of a Dutch roll half- cycle is 2 to 3 seconds. The Dutch roll mode can be excited by any use of aileron or rudder, but for flight test purposes it is usually excited with a rudder singlet (short, sharp motions of the rudder to a specified angle, and then back to the centered position) or doublet (a pair of such motions in opposite directions). Some larger aircraft are better excited with aileron inputs. Periods can range from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Rolling on a heading Dutch roll is also the name (considered by professionals to be a misnomer) given to a coordination maneuver generally taught to student pilots to help them improve their \\"stick- and-rudder\\" technique. The aircraft is alternately rolled as much as 60 degrees left and right while rudder is applied to keep the nose of the aircraft pointed at a fixed point. More correctly, this is a rudder coordination practice exercise, to teach a student pilot how to correct for the effect known as adverse aileron yaw during roll inputs. This coordination technique is better referred to as \\"rolling on a heading\\", wherein the aircraft is rolled in such a way as to maintain an accurate heading without the nose moving from side-to-side (or yawing). The yaw motion is induced through the use of ailerons alone due to aileron drag, wherein the lifting wing (aileron down) is doing more work than the descending wing (aileron up) and therefore creates more drag, forcing the lifting wing back, yawing the aircraft toward it. This yawing effect produced by rolling motion is known as adverse yaw. This has to be countered precisely by application of rudder in the same direction as the aileron control (left stick, left rudder – right stick, right rudder). This is known as synchronised controls when done properly, and is difficult to learn and apply well. The correct amount of rudder to apply with aileron is different for each aircraft. Name The origin of the name Dutch roll is uncertain. However, it is likely that this term, describing a lateral asymmetric motion of an airplane, was borrowed from a reference to similar-appearing motion in ice skating. In 1916, aeronautical engineer Jerome Clarke Hunsaker published the following quote: \\"Dutch roll – the third element in the [lateral] motion [of an airplane] is a yawing to the right and left, combined with rolling. The motion is oscillatory of period for 7 to 12 seconds, which may or may not be damped. The analogy to 'Dutch Roll' or 'Outer Edge' in ice skating is obvious.\\" In 1916, Dutch Roll was the term used for skating repetitively to right and left (by analogy to the motion described for the aircraft) on the outer edge of one's skates. By 1916, the term had been imported from skating to aeronautical engineering, perhaps by Hunsaker himself. 1916 was only five years after G. H. Bryan did the first mathematical analysis of lateral motion of aircraft in 1911. Accidents * On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707 on customer-acceptance flight, where the yaw damper was turned off to familiarize the new pilots with flying techniques, a trainee pilot's actions violently exacerbated the Dutch roll motion and caused three of the four engines to be torn from the wings. The plane, a brand new 707-227, N7071, destined for Braniff, crash-landed on a river bed north of Seattle at Arlington, Washington, killing four of the eight occupants.HistoryLink, posted 7/23/2017. Boeing 707 jetliner crashes in Snohomish County, October 19, 1959. * On March 6, 2005, Air Transat Flight 961, an Airbus A310, was involved in a Dutch roll incident following structural failure of the rudder at cruising altitude after departure from Juan Gualberto Gomez Airport, Varadero, Cuba. The aircraft returned to the airport with serious structural damage and one flight attendant slightly injured. * On May 3, 2013, a McConnell AFB, KS (USAF) KC-135R, 63-8877, flown by a Fairchild AFB, Washington aircrew, broke up in flight about eleven minutes after taking off from Manas Air base in Kyrgyzstan, killing all three crew members. After investigation, it was determined that a rudder power control unit malfunction led to a Dutch roll oscillatory instability. Not recognizing the Dutch roll, the crew used the rudder to stay on course, which exacerbated the instability, leading to an unrecoverable flight condition. The over-stressed tail section detached and the aircraft broke apart soon after. The aircraft was at cruise altitude about 200 km west of Bishkek before it crashed in a mountainous area near the village of Chorgolu, close to the border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. * On October 30, 2015 a Leonardo- Finmeccanica-Helicopters Division (formerly AgustaWestland) AW609 prototype crashed in Italy killing its two pilots. Further investigation by the Italian ANSV established a Dutch roll during a high-speed test could be the cause.Interim Report ANSV  See also  * Roll subsidence * Spiral divergence  References   External links * youtube.com HairyRocket: \\"Так самолеты не летают 2\\" (Planes do not fly like that 2) YouTube video from 46 sec, total duration 4:04 m:s.

The fraction r = k/n is called the code rate. The fraction k’/k, where k’ denotes the number of symbols required for recovery, is called reception efficiency. Optimal erasure codes Optimal erasure codes have the property that any k out of the n code word symbols are sufficient to recover the original message (i.e., they have optimal reception efficiency). Optimal erasure codes are maximum distance separable codes (MDS codes). =Parity check= Parity check is the special case where n = k + 1. From a set of k values \\\\\\\\{v_i\\\\\\\\}_{1\\\\leq i \\\\leq k}, a checksum is computed and appended to the k source values: :v_{k+1}= - \\\\sum_{i=1}^k v_i. The set of k + 1 values \\\\\\\\{v_i\\\\\\\\}_{1\\\\leq i \\\\leq k+1} is now consistent with regard to the checksum. If one of these values, v_e, is erased, it can be easily recovered by summing the remaining variables: :v_{e}= - \\\\sum_{i=1 ,i eq e }^{k+1}v_i. =Polynomial oversampling= Example: Err-mail (k = 2) In the simple case where k = 2, redundancy symbols may be created by sampling different points along the line between the two original symbols. This is pictured with a simple example, called err-mail: Alice wants to send her telephone number (555629) to Bob using err-mail. Err-mail works just like e-mail, except #About half of all the mail gets lost.Some versions of this story refer to the err-mail daemon. #Messages longer than 5 characters are illegal. #It is very expensive (similar to air-mail). Instead of asking Bob to acknowledge the messages she sends, Alice devises the following scheme. #She breaks her telephone number up into two parts a = 555, b = 629, and sends 2 messages – \\"A=555\\" and \\"B=629\\" – to Bob. #She constructs a linear function, f(i) = a + (b-a)(i-1), in this case f(i) = 555 + 74(i-1), such that f(1) = 555 and f(2) = 629. File:Code d'effacement optimal 1.gif #She computes the values f(3), f(4), and f(5), and then transmits three redundant messages: \\"C=703\\", \\"D=777\\" and \\"E=851\\". Bob knows that the form of f(k) is f(i) = a + (b-a)(i-1), where a and b are the two parts of the telephone number. Now suppose Bob receives \\"D=777\\" and \\"E=851\\". File:Code d'effacement optimal 2.gif Bob can reconstruct Alice's phone number by computing the values of a and b from the values (f(4) and f(5)) he has received. Bob can perform this procedure using any two err-mails, so the erasure code in this example has a rate of 40%. Note that Alice cannot encode her telephone number in just one err-mail, because it contains six characters, and that the maximum length of one err-mail message is five characters. If she sent her phone number in pieces, asking Bob to acknowledge receipt of each piece, at least four messages would have to be sent anyway (two from Alice, and two acknowledgments from Bob). So the erasure code in this example, which requires five messages, is quite economical. This example is a little bit contrived. For truly generic erasure codes that work over any data set, we would need something other than the f(i) given. General case The linear construction above can be generalized to polynomial interpolation. Additionally, points are now computed over a finite field. First we choose a finite field F with order of at least n, but usually a power of 2. The sender numbers the data symbols from 0 to k − 1 and sends them. He then constructs a (Lagrange) polynomial p(x) of order k such that p(i) is equal to data symbol i. He then sends p(k), ..., p(n − 1). The receiver can now also use polynomial interpolation to recover the lost packets, provided he receives k symbols successfully. If the order of F is less than 2b, where b is the number of bits in a symbol, then multiple polynomials can be used. The sender can construct symbols k to n − 1 'on the fly', i.e., distribute the workload evenly between transmission of the symbols. If the receiver wants to do his calculations 'on the fly', he can construct a new polynomial q, such that q(i) = p(i) if symbol i < k was received successfully and q(i) = 0 when symbol i < k was not received. Now let r(i) = p(i) − q(i). Firstly we know that r(i) = 0 if symbol i < k has been received successfully. Secondly, if symbol i ≥k has been received successfully, then r(i) = p(i) − q(i) can be calculated. So we have enough data points to construct r and evaluate it to find the lost packets. So both the sender and the receiver require O(n (n − k)) operations and only O(n − k) space for operating 'on the fly'. Real world implementation This process is implemented by Reed–Solomon codes, with code words constructed over a finite field using a Vandermonde matrix. Near-optimal erasure codes Near-optimal erasure codes require (1 + ε)k symbols to recover the message (where ε>0). Reducing ε can be done at the cost of CPU time. Near-optimal erasure codes trade correction capabilities for computational complexity: practical algorithms can encode and decode with linear time complexity. Fountain codes (also known as rateless erasure codes) are notable examples of near-optimal erasure codes. They can transform a k symbol message into a practically infinite encoded form, i.e., they can generate an arbitrary amount of redundancy symbols that can all be used for error correction. Receivers can start decoding after they have received slightly more than k encoded symbols. Regenerating codes address the issue of rebuilding (also called repairing) lost encoded fragments from existing encoded fragments. This issue occurs in distributed storage systems where communication to maintain encoded redundancy is a problem.

Tombstone in English: Maria Arros Sagaray died on the 19th day of April, 1736 The mythology of the ancient Basques largely did not survive the arrival of Christianity in the Basque Country between the 4th and 12th century AD. Most of what is known about elements of this original belief system is based on the analysis of legends, the study of place names and scant historical references to pagan rituals practised by the Basques. One main figure of this belief system was the female goddess Mari. According to legends collected in the area of Ataun, the other main figure was her consort Sugaar. However, due to the scarcity of the material, it is difficult to say if this would have been the \\"central pair\\" of the Basque pantheon. Based on the attributes ascribed to these mythological creatures, this would be considered a chthonic religion as all its characters dwell on earth or below it, with the sky seen mostly as an empty corridor through which the divinities pass. Historical sources The main sources for information about non-Christian Basque beliefs are:Kasper, M. Baskische Geschichte (1997) Primus *Strabo, who mentions the sacrifice of male goats and humans *Arab writers from the time of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania *the 12th century diary of the pilgrim Aymeric Picaud *various medieval sources making references to pagan rituals, including the records of the Inquisition *19th and 20th century collections of myths and folk-tales, such as those collected by José Miguel Barandiaran, which comprise by far the largest body of material relating to non-Christian beliefs and practices *the modern study of place-names in the Basque Country Mythological creatures and characters The Urtzi controversy Urtzi may or may not have been a Basque mythological figure. There is evidence that can be read as either supporting or contradicting the existence of such a deity. To date neither theory has been able to convince fully.Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 Influencing other religions The Iberian Peninsula's Indo-European cultures like the Lusitanians and Celtiberians seem to have a significant Basque substrate in their mythologies. This includes the concept of the Enchanted Mouras, which may be based on the Mairu,Anuntxi Arana: Mari, mairu eta beste - 1996 - Bulletin du musée basque n°146. and the god Endovelicus, whose name may come from proto-Basque words.Encarnação, José d’. 2015.

Graphical User Interface, What is Embedded Linux? And How does it work? , Retrieved on 2019-06-05. History The Linux kernel has been ported to a variety of CPUs which are not only primarily used as the processor of a desktop or server computer, but also ARC, ARM, AVR32, ETRAX CRIS, FR-V, H8300, IP7000, m68k, MIPS, mn10300, PowerPC, SuperH, and Xtensa processors. Linux is also used as an alternative to using a proprietary operating system and its associated toolchain. The Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset is a Linux distribution that fits on a floppy disk for outdated or low resource hardware. Devices coverage Due to its low cost (freely available source code) and ease of customization, Linux has been shipped in many consumer devices. Devices covering PDAs (like the Sharp Zaurus family), TomTom GPS navigation devices, residential gateways like the Linksys WRT54G series or smartphones such as the Motorola exz series, Openmoko handsets, devices running Sailfish OS developed by Jolla like Jolla C and Intex Aqua Fish and the Nokia N900 and Nokia N9. Android, a Linux-kernel-based operating system acquired and extended by Google and introduced in 2008, has become a highly competitive platform for smartphones and tablets. In July 2012, Android's smartphone market share in the United States was at 52%, reaching 82% worldwide in Q2 2015. Communities With the availability of consumer embedded devices, communities of users and developers were formed around these devices: replacement or enhancements of the Linux distribution shipped on the device has often been made possible thanks to availability of the source code and to the communities surrounding the devices. Due to the high number of devices, standardized build systems have appeared, including Yocto, OpenEmbedded, Buildroot, OpenWrt, and LTIB. Platform usage The advantages of embedded Linux over proprietary embedded operating systems include multiple suppliers for software, development and support; no royalties or licensing fees; a stable kernel; the ability to read, modify and redistribute the source code. The technical disadvantages include a comparatively large memory footprint (kernel and root filesystem); complexities of user mode and kernel mode memory access, and a complex device drivers framework.

Seade was born in Antofagasta, Chile, the elder son of a Lebanese immigrant family. Eleven years later his whole family moved to Montevideo, Uruguay. At the age of 12 Seade began working as an assistant to the Muralist Enrique Albertazzi and the painter Guillermo Rodríguez. Under Rodríguez' influence Seade took some painting courses at the Fine Arts Circle school. He had his first show in 1925. From 1931 well into the 1950s Seade presented work in many national and city halls. In 1944, Seade began his parallel career as a teacher. He first work as teacher of drawing at the Liceo de Colonia, where he managed to paint the large mural, Alegoría al Trabajo (1936), and later as a professor of the Montevideo Fine Arts School, where he taught for 25 years. It is impossible to understand Seade's artistic life without a reference to his political life. He wanted to paint for \\"the people, not for the walls of the bourgeoisie\\". He aspired to paint murals, the preferred way for his generation to reach the masses, but the only murals he managed to finish were the one in Colonia and the La marcha del Pueblo à la Piedra Alta (1939) at the Conference Hall of the Liceo de Florida. However, a significant part or Seade's work is formed by his sketches of murals and preparity sketches for murals. Thematically, Seade mostly sought to represent the characters of Uruguayan life - washing women, Gauchos, soccer fans, kids and women. Not from a tourist perspective, which he despised, but with the passion of a convinced social realist. Seade was also an expert draughtsman. His most public work was a long series of illustrations for a key local magazine, Mundo Uruguayo. His more private drawings were mostly sketches for paintings. Although Seade had an active participation in Salons and through his teaching was one of the more visible artists of Uruguay in his time, he disliked and avoided the world of galleries and art critics. This is probably one reason why after his death he has remained in relative obscurity. Important critics and historians such as Gabriel Peluffo Linari, Fernando García Esteban and Atahualpa del Cioppo have recognised Seade's cultural importance.

The village is on the A4 road which was historically the main route from London to the west of England.  History  Fyfield Down has extensive remains from successive phases of prehistoric to post-medieval activity. A 300-acre field system extending onto Overton Down has produced Iron Age and Romano-British finds. The downland has many sarsen stones – pieces of dense, hard, sandy rock. In prehistoric times these were used for monuments, handaxes, quern-stones and other implements; medieval houses in Kennet Valley villages had walls made from sarsen blocks. Around 1850, Edward Free began a stone-cutting business at Fyfield which supplied much material for buildings, pavements and kerbs. The Free family moved to Marlborough in 1890; sarsen cutting declined after 1915 and ceased in 1939. Prior to the mid 19th century, the village was centred south of the church, in the valley northeast of Lockeridge House (c. 1740). After a fire, this area was abandoned in favour of higher ground along the Bath Road; many of the new cottages were demolished during road improvements in the 1930s, leaving the village without a heart. From c. 1880, about 560 acres on Fyfield Down and Overton Down, overlapping much of the present nature reserve and then owned by the Meux family, was managed as a rabbit warren for sport shooting. Most of the land was sold in 1906 by the widow of Sir Henry Bruce Meux to racehorse trainer Alec Taylor; in 1910 Taylor closed the warren and had some 14,000 rabbits killed, in order to use the area for exercising horses. Governance The parish elects a joint parish council with the adjacent parish of West Overton; the council is named Fyfield and West Overton. It falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Before the 19th century, Fyfield was a chapelry of Overton parish, alongside the tithings of East Overton, Lockeridge, Shaw, and West Overton. The tithings became a poor law parish called West Overton while Fyfield relieved its own poor; this probably led the Census enumerators of 1841 to class Fyfield, with its medieval chapel, incorrectly as an ancient parish, which in turn led to its establishment as a civil parish. Clatford Park and Overton Heath, to the south of the ancient Wansdyke and in the far south of the modern parish, were Extra- parochial places in the earlier 19th century. In 1896 they were merged into Fyfield parish. Landmarks North of the A4, the parish extends onto the Marlborough Downs. Here Fyfield Down is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, noted for its sarsen stones and prehistoric sites including The Devil's Den, the remains of a neolithic burial chamber. Parts of the south of the parish lie within the West Woods, which has been managed since 1931 by the Forestry Commission. Church The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas is Grade II* listed. The building has 13th-century origins and a 15th-century tower; it was restored in 1849. Today the church is part of the Upper Kennet benefice. Inns Fyfield’s earliest known inn was The Crown and Fighting Cocks. Mark Pope Snr was the innholder at the time of drafting his last will and testament in 1776. According to his will he left the inn to his wife, Anne Pope, for the term of her life or until the day she remarried. Mark died in June 1780 and his will was proved at Marlborough on 24 July 1780. In his will Mark referred to his \\"ancient dwelling house or Inn known by the sign of The Crown and Fighting Cocks situated and being in Fyfield\\". This suggests the inn had been in business for an extended period.Wiltshire and Swindon Archives. Probate records for the Archdeaconry of Wiltshire.

The company manufactured steam-powered shunting locomotives for over 100 years, and currently manufactures diesel-engined shunting locomotives. As of 2012 the company is part of the LH Group; a subsidiary The Hunslet Steam Company maintains and manufactures steam locomotives. Irish Mail is typical of many small engines built at Hunslet for use in quarries History = The early years 1864–1901 = Louisa, works number 195 of 1877, one of the earliest examples of the Quarry Hunslet type The Hunslet Engine Company was founded in 1864 at Jack Lane, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England by John Towlerton Leather, a civil engineering contractor, who appointed James Campbell (son of Alexander Campbell, a Leeds engineer) as his Works Manager. The first engine built in 1865 was Linden, a standard gauge delivered to Brassey and Ballard, a railway civil engineering contractor as were several of the firm's early customers. Other customers included collieries. This basic standard gauge shunting and short haul 'industrial' engine was to be the main-stay of Hunslet production for many years. In 1871, James Campbell bought the company for £25,000 (payable in five instalments over two years) and the firm remained in the Campbell family ownership for many years. Between 1865 and 1870, production had averaged less than ten engines per year, but in 1871 this had risen to seventeen and was set to rise over the next thirty years to a modest maximum of thirty-four. Dinorwic Slate Quarries in 1922 and now on the Llanberis Lake Railway In 1870, Hunslet constructed their first narrow gauge engine Dinorwic, a diminutive gauge for the Dinorwic Slate Quarry at Llanberis. This engine later renamed Charlie was the first of twenty similar engines built for this quarry and did much to establish Hunslet as a major builder of quarry engines. This quarry was linked to Port Dinorwic by a gauge line for which Hunslet built three engines Dinorwic, Padarn and Velinheli. Much larger than the normal quarry type, gauge engines Charles, Blanche and Linda were built in 1882/3 for use on the Penrhyn Quarry Railway 'main line' between Bethesda and Port Penrhyn in North Wales.Two of these still operate on the Ffestiniog Railway while Charles is preserved in the Penrhyn Castle Railway Museum Many short wheelbase tank locomotives () were supplied to the Manchester Ship Canal Company in 1881. The first Hunslet engine built for export was their No. 10, an shipped via Hull and Rotterdam to Java. By 1902, Hunslet had supplied engines to over thirty countries worldwide, often opening up new markets. In Ireland, Hunslet supplied engines to several of the newly opened narrow gauge lines and also in 1887 built the three unorthodox engines for the Lartigue Monorail system used by the Listowel & Ballybunion Railway. From 1873 onwards many Hunslet locomotives were exported to Australia for use on both main line and lesser lines. =1901–1939= In 1901, James Campbell was still in charge as proprietor and James's four sons were, by then all working for the company including the eldest son Alexander III who had taken over as Works Manager on the death of his Uncle George in 1890. In 1902, the company was reorganised as a private limited company with the name Hunslet Engine Company Ltd. but was still a family business. Following the death of James Campbell in 1905, the chairmanship passed to Alexander III and brother Robert became works manager, whilst brother Will retained the role of secretary and traveller with a seat on the board. About this time Hunslet was building a series of s for the Sierra Leone Government Railway design elements of which were included in the construction of the famous Russell a gauge engine built for the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway. Following family disagreements both Will and the youngest brother Gordon soon left the company and a serious injury left Robert disabled and unable to continue as works manager. The post of works manager was advertised and Edgar Alcock, then assistant works manager at the Gorton Foundry of Beyer-Peacock, was appointed in 1912. Alcock came to Hunslet at a time of change when the industry was being asked for far larger and more powerful locomotives than had ever been required in the past. This was true at Hunslet which found its overseas customers asking for very large engines. One example was an order for two 86 ton s from the Antofagasta, Chile & Bolivia Railway.Rolt, p. 69 During the First World War overseas orders dried up. The company, like many others, found itself employing women on the shop floor and engaged in the manufacture of munitions. It continued to produce limited numbers of locomotives, significant examples being lightweight narrow gauge designs for the War Department Light Railways. After the First World War Hunslet were once more able to attract overseas orders and they also received a series of repeat orders from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway for 90 LMS Fowler Class 3F 'Jinty' shunting engines. It was during the 1930s that Hunslet built their largest locomotives; two engines, built for a special train-ferry loading job in China – they were at that date the largest and most powerful tank engines ever built. A year or so later the same design formed the basis for an 0-8-0 tender engine for India. Many other 'large-engine' orders were received in these inter-war years. Other independent British manufacturers failed to survive the depression of the 1920s and 30s and Hunslet acquired the patterns, rights and designs of other builders including Kerr Stuart and the Avonside Engine Co.. =1930–2000= John Alcock, who, following in his father's footsteps, became Managing Director of Hunslet in 1958, recalled his father telling him circa 1920, when he was still a schoolboy, that his main endeavour for the company would be in the application of the internal combustion engine to railway locomotion. Throughout the 1930s, Hunslet worked on the perfecting of the diesel locomotive. Austerity 68081 During the second world war, the company again served the country well in the manufacture of munitions, but they also built engines, both steam and diesel for the war effort. Noteworthy is their role in the production of the \\"Austerity\\" shunting locomotive. It was an austerity revision of the 50550 shunter design, itself a development of the Hunslet 48150 shunter design, of which 16 had been built pre-war. Hunslet produced 149 Austeritys during the hostilities, and sub-contracted construction of almost 200 more. A total of 485 Austerities were built by Hunslet and other builders between 1943 and 1964, of which over 70 examples have entered preservation. Locomotive construction resumed after the war. Important in post-war production was the Hunslet flame-proof diesel engine for use in the coal mines, as well as further batches of Austerity shunters for the National Coal Board and the Army, and rebuilding of some older Austeritys, work which continued into the early 1960s. The last three Austeritys were sold in 1970: one directly to preservation, one for scrap and one to the NCB.Austerity Spares List, p. 32 The last industrial steam engine built in Britain was built at Hunslet in 1971 for export to Trangkil sugar mill in Central Java, Indonesia. The \\"Jack Lane, Hunslet, Leeds\\" works was closed in 1995, the last order being a batch of narrow gauge diesel locomotives for tunnelling on the Jubilee Line Extension of the London Underground. =2000– present= The former Hunslet works in 2009. In 2004 the Hunslet Engine Company was acquired by the LH Group – production was moved to Barton under Needwood; whilst other operations remained in Leeds. In 2006 the company manufactured remote-controlled diesel electric shunters for John M. Henderson & Co. Ltd. to be supplied to POSCO's coking plant in South Korea. The same year saw the completion of several orders for underground and mining diesel locomotives. In 2007 Hunslet began developing a new family of locomotives ranging from shunters to vehicles weighing up to 100 tons. The first locomotive of the new class, the DH60C, a 3 axle C diesel hydraulic shunting locomotive, was unveiled in July 2010. The company also operated a locomotive hire business (including a British Rail Class 08 shunter acquired in 2006), mainly of industrial shunting locomotives. In 2012 LH Group was sold to the Wabtec Corporation for US$48 million. The company owns the right to the names and designs of a number of former British locomotive manufacturers including Andrew Barclay, Avonside Engine Company, North British Locomotive Company, Greenwood and Batley, Hudswell Clarke, John Fowler & Co., Kerr Stuart, Kitson & Co., and Manning Wardle – it also maintains, and supplies spare parts for those brands. ;The Hunslet Steam Co. The Hunslet Steam Co. is part of the LH Group. The company is involved in new-build steam locomotives (including two Quarry Hunslet locomotives), boiler making and locomotive maintenance. Related companies =Hunslet-Barclay Ltd= Hunslet-Barclay was acquired by the Hunslet group in 1972, it chiefly undertook maintenance and refurbishment of diesel multiple unit passenger trains at the Andrew Barclay Caledonia Works in Kilmarnock. In 2003 the LH Group acquired the locomotive interests of the company. In October 2007 Hunslet-Barclay went into receivership and in November was purchased by FKI (the owner of Brush Traction) and renamed Brush-Barclay. In 2011 Brush Traction and Brush-Barclay were purchased by the Wabtec Corporation.

They were used as traditional fishing boats from the 1850s on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The Banks dory is a small, open, narrow, flat-bottomed and slab-sided boat with a particularly narrow transom. They were inexpensive to build and could be stacked or nested inside each other and stored on the decks of larger fishing vessels which functioned as mother ships. Banks dories have long overhangs at the bow and stern which helps them lift over waves. There were one-man and two-man versions. Most could be fitted with sails. The dories became more stable in when they were loaded with about half a ton of catch. Production Cod fishing on the Newfoundland Banks The Banks dory type is very simple and efficient to produce, making them well suited to mass production. By 1880, Bank dories were being built in large numbers in the Massachusetts towns of Gloucester, Beverly, Essex, Newburyport, and Salisbury (Amesbury). Other major areas of production included Seabrook, New Hampshire; Lunenburg, Nova Scotia; Shelburne, Nova Scotia and both Portland and Bremen, Maine. Salisbury alone had 7 shops producing between 200 and 650 boats a year. The firm of Higgins and Giford of Gloucester advertised in 1886 that it had built over 3,000 dories in the preceding 13 years. Founded in 1793, Lowell's Boat Shop of Amesbury Massachusetts is the oldest continuously operating boat shop in United States. It was the first to build these boats in large numbers and excelled at their mass production. In the year 1911 Lowell's Boat Shop produced 2029 dories, averaging 7 dories a working day. A National Landmark and working museum, Lowell's Boat Shop continues to build its dories and skiffs in the Lowell tradition to this day. The Dory Shop Museum, seen on the right, in Shelburne, Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, the towns of Lunenburg and Shelburne maintained a rivalry in mass production of dories. A distinction emerged in 1887 with the use in Shelburne of \\"dory clips\\", metal braces used to join frames, versus the more expensive but stronger natural wood frames used in Lunenburg dories. The John Williams Dory Shop in Shelburne was one of several Shelburne factories mass-producing dories. It is now the Dory Shop Museum, operated by the Nova Scotia Museum and continues to produce dories. Mother ships Typically schooners were used as dory mother ships The Fog Warning, painted by Winslow Homer in 1885 Banks dories were carried aboard mother ships, usually fishing schooners, and used for handlining cod on the Grand Banks. Before Banks dories were introduced, fish were caught with handlines from the mother ship alone. Weather permitting, the dories were launched early each day with one or two crew and bait from previous catches. During the day they would return several times to the mother ship and unload their catches. The barquentine, Gazela Primeiro, while not a schooner, was one of the last of the dory mother ships. She had a long association with dories and the Grand Banks cod industry and made her final voyage in 1969. Banks dories have survived long voyages, some unintended, when the fishermen became separated from their mother ships. One of the more famous adventures was by Howard Blackburn who survived 5 days in the North Atlantic. A Banks dory is seen in Winslow Homer's painting The Fog Warning. The Boston Fine Art Museum gives this description: > The Fog Warning is a painting with a narrative, though its tale is > disturbing rather than charming. As indicated by the halibut in his dory, > the fisherman in this picture has been successful. But the hardest task of > the day, the return to the main ship, is still ahead of him. He turns to > look at the horizon, measuring the distance to the mother ship, and to > safety. The seas are choppy and the dory rocks high on the waves, making it > clear that the journey home will require considerable physical effort. But > more threatening is the approaching fog bank, whose streamers echo, even > mock, the fisherman's profile. Other uses CSS Acadia The rugged construction, affordability and ease of stowage made banks dories popular for work boats on large sailing vessels as well as steamships and motor vessels. These same virtues made them popular for inshore fishermen in some locales. They were also used in later years as lifeboats and tenders on commercial motor fishing boats such as Cape Islander fishing boats.David A. Walker and Wayne Barrett Small Wooden Boats of the Atlantic Halifax, NS: Nimbus (1990), p. 22 In recent times, the history and iconic look of banks dories have made them popular for amateur boat builders and some recreational boaters.

It is a very new volcano, the youngest in Central America, having first appeared in April 1850. It consists of a gravelly basaltic cinder cone, which contrasts greatly with the surrounding verdant hillsides, and gives rise to its name, which means Black Hill. Cerro Negro has erupted frequently since its first eruption. One unusual aspect of several eruptions has been the emission of ash from the top of the cone, while lava erupts from fractures at the base. Cerro Negro is a polygenetic cinder cone that is part of the Central America Volcanic Arc, which formed as a result of the Cocos Plate subducting under the Caribbean Plate, at a rate of per year. It is the largest and southernmost of four cinder cones that have formed along a NW-SE trend line in the Cordillera de los Maribios mountain range. Despite its youth, Cerro Negro has been one of the most active volcanoes in Nicaragua, with its latest eruption occurring in 1999. Since its birth in 1850, it has erupted approximately 23 times. Eruptive history The first recorded eruption of Cerro Negro occurred on April 13, 1850 and volcanic activity lasted until May 27. Central vent and explosive eruptions transpired, with lava flow and damage to land and property. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) was recorded at 2 out of 8, classifying the eruption as Strombolian/Vulcanian. Finally, the lava volume was recorded to be 5.4 x 10 and the tephra volume was 6.5 x 105 m3. Cerro Negro's second eruption took place on November 14, 1867 and volcanic activity lasted until November 30. Radial fissure and explosive eruptions occurred, with some lava flows, along the NE-SW trend line fissure. The VEI was also recorded at 2 (Strombolian/Vulcanian), and the tephra volume was 8.6 x 106 m3. The third eruption of Cerro Negro occurred 32 years later and lasted from November 22 to November 29, 1899. Explosive eruptions resulted in damaged land, and the VEI was also recorded as a 2. Finally, the tephra volume was documented at 1.7 x 106 m3. From October 28 to November 3, 1914, the volcano erupted explosively at the central vent. Mudslides also resulted in increased damage to the land, but there were no fatalities because they did not flow over any villages or towns. Although the VEI was yet again 2, the tephra volume was a recorded 2.8 x 106 m3. Five years later, Cerro Negro erupted again from June 20–30, 1919, with explosive eruptions resulting in a VEI of 2. No tephra or lava volumes were recorded at this time. Just four years after that, from October 23 until December 11, 1923, Cerro Negro erupted along the summit and upper north flank. Central vent and radial fissure explosions erupted during this time, and lava flows were recorded in this VEI 3 sub- plinian eruption. It was the largest eruption in the history of the volcano, with the lava volume being 1.0 x 107 m3 and the tephra volume being 3.6 x 107 m3. Cerro Negro erupted next on February 10, 1929, and volcanic activity lasted until March. Flank (excentric) vent and radial fissures also explosively erupted, resulting in excessive lava flows. The volume of lava erupted was recorded at only 1.0 x 105 m3 in the VEI 2 eruption. =Eruptions of 1947, 1948 and 1950= Eruption of Cerro Negro in 1948 Another 18 years passed before Cerro Negro erupted again, but on July 9, 1947 the volcano had its largest eruption to date. The VEI was recorded at 3 along the summit and NE flank, with the eruptive characteristics including central vent eruption, flank venting, and lava flows. Evacuations were called for the Malpaisillo village, and major land and property damage resulted from the volcano's explosive eruptions. The recorded lava volume was 3.8 x 106 m3 and the recorded tephra volume was 3.1 x 107 m3. Less than one year later, on March 31, 1948, Cerro Negro recorded another Strombolian eruption (VEI 2) from its central vent. No lava or tephra volumes were recorded, however. A similar eruption occurred in June 1949, with the VEI 2 eruption exploding from the central vent. Another sub-plinian VEI 3 explosive vulcanian eruption occurred from Cerro Negro's central vent from November 21 to December 17, 1950. Lava flows resulted, but evacuation was unnecessary. The lava volume was 1.0 x 105 m3 and the tephra volume was 3.8 x 107 m3 for this particular eruption. =1954 eruption= In February 1954 another VEI 2 Strombolian eruption exploded out of Cerro Negro's central vent, but lava and tephra volumes were not recorded. Three years later from September 4–24, 1957, a VEI of 2 was recorded via the summit and east flank of Cerro Negro. Lava flows damaged the land from the explosive eruption, with the lava volume reaching 4.5 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume reaching 2.8 x 106 m3. The summit and south flank exploded next on September 28, 1960, and volcanic activity continued until December 26. This particular VEI was determined to be level 3 after radial fissure and central vent eruptions occurred. Land damage was caused to the surrounding land via lava flows, with the volume of the lava recorded at 5.2 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume recorded at 3.4 x 107 m3. Cerro Negro's NE-flank fissure erupted next on October 25, 1961. Although radial fissure eruption and lava flow was characteristic of this particular eruption, the VEI was only recorded as a 1, and no lava or tephra volumes were recorded. It was the smallest Cerro Negro eruption to date. Another eruption from the central vent occurred on March 21, 1962 and lasted until early April. The VEI was recorded as 2, and lava flows were observed, although no land damage was witnessed. Exactly one year later, a VEI 1 eruption occurred from the central vent of Cerro Negro on March 21, 1963. =1968 eruption= Eruption of Cerro Negro in 1968 The volcanic activity from October 23 until December 10, 1968 marked the formation of the Cristo Rey crater, when the summit and south flank of Cerro Negro erupted with a sub-plinian VEI of 3. The new vent formed a lava flow 750m long and 600m wide and a thickness of 3m. Thirteen villages located near the erupting volcano were evacuated on the 27th because of the excessive ash falls. Additional larger-scale evacuations Nicaragua's 2nd largest city, León, recorded ash falls of over 1 cm thick. Lava flows advanced at a rate of 23 m/day, and it caused additional land damage as the lava poured from three of Cerro Negro's craters, fountaining to heights of 30m into the air. The eruptive ash columns reached heights of 2.3 to 4.8 km. In addition, incandescent gases from the vents raised to heights of 120 meters, and these could be seen over 50 km away from the volcano. When the volcanic activity ceased, the lava volume totaled 6.9 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume totaled 2.7 x107 m3. =1969 eruption= Another small-scale VEI 1 eruption took place after the central vent exploded from December 19–29, 1969. But two years later from February 3–14, 1971, the towns surrounding Cerro Negro were again evacuated due to the sudden sub-plinian VEI 3 eruption of the summit and the formation and eruption of a new eastern flank. Volcanic bombs were shot approximately 600m into the air, and incandescent gases were released during the time in between eruptions. Ash columns were approximately 10 km high, and a tephra volume of 5.8 x107 m3 (over 300 square kilometers) caused major damage to the local crops and buildings. The city of León alone had recorded 18 cm of ash, which resulted in large-scale building collapse. =1992 eruption= Over 20 years passed, and the Cerro Negro volcano was at peace until one of the volcano's largest eruptions occurred on April 9, 1992. Volcanic activity lasted for a total of five days, with the main sub-plinian eruption (VEI 3) occurring over a two-day time period, producing an ash column that was roughly seven kilometers high. Over 20,000 people were immediately evacuated, mostly due to failed water systems until eruptions ceased on the 14th of April. This eruption caused several fatalities, and widespread damage to land and property after the tephra volume measured 2.6 x 107 m3. This large tephra volume produced approximately four centimeters of ash across most of León, resulting in many collapsed roofs and additional injuries and fatalities. =1995 eruption= Three years later, volcanic activity started on May 29, 1995, which marked the beginning of the first phase of this eruption. Small, phreatic eruptions occurred frequently during this phase, averaging 100-160 explosions per day. These Strombolian eruptions generated convective ash columns that reached heights of 200–1000 meters, and these explosions lasted for a period of 79 days. A low-energy pyroclastic flow was observed on the northwestern flank on June 2. After June 6, the number of eruptions decreased gradually at a rate of 30-40 eruptions per day. By July 19, all volcanic activity ceased for a period of 95 days. By mid-November, the hiatus ended and the second phase commenced. Eruptions continued for a period of thirteen days and lasted until December 3, 1995. During this time, the eruptions were larger, and volcanic bombs and blocks up to two meters in diameter were ejected from Cerro Negro. Ash columns achieve heights of 2 to 2.5 meters While the VEI was only measured as a 2, central vent explosions, pyroclastic flows, phreatic explosions, and lava dome extrusion were all characteristic of this eruption period. New lava filled about 2/3 of the 1992 crater, and additional lava flows caused damage to land, extending 1.5 km north of the north base cone. Ash falls caused damage to property and farmland, with an average deposit of two millimeters per day in León (~20 km from volcano), but there were no fatalities during the safe evacuation of 6000 people in the surrounding villages. Overall, the lava flow volume reached 8.0 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume peaked at 5.8 x 106 m3 during this eruption period, resulting in the addition of about 50 meters of height to the cinder cone. =1999 eruption= The last volcanic activity at Cerro Negro occurred on August 5, 1999 and lasted for a total of two days. Three earthquakes ( 5.2) occurred in three hours, which triggered a small-scale eruption of the volcano. It was the first time in the history of Cerro Negro that large- magnitude earthquakes preceded the eruption. The VEI was only recorded as a 1, as the south flank (near the Cristo Rey crater) experienced radial fissure eruption, along with explosive and phreatic eruptions, in the formation of three new vents. Small-scale evacuations of surrounding villages were carried out, but the low-volatile, highly crystalline basaltic magma only had a lava volume of 6 x 105 m3. Additionally, the tephra volume was only in the 106m3 range. It was concluded that the volcanic activity of Cerro Negro in 1999 was tectonically-induced, and had three earthquakes not occurred, the eruption would have also not occurred. The most recent eruptions at Cerro Negro occurred in August 1999, although strong seismic activity was registered in early 2004. In 1998, an eruption was thought to have occurred shortly after the passage of Hurricane Mitch, but it later transpired that the copious amounts of steam seen rising from the volcano were caused by rainwater percolating through to hot lava from the 1995 eruption. Following the 1999 eruption, the summit crater and fissures created from this eruption are currently the main source of volcanic gas flux today. It is estimated that the total CO2 output of Cerro Negro is conservatively estimated to be 2,800 t d-1. Although the Cerro Negro volcano has only been around for a period of 159 years, it has erupted at least 23 times, which is highly active compared to most volcanoes. This historical growth of the volcano has allowed for documentation of the growth of this volcano over time. It was discovered that the timing of future eruptions is correlated with the volume of the previous significant eruption. Since there have been steady-state eruptions since 1900, a Cerro Negro Time-Volume Prediction Model was made. Although a small-scale eruption did occur in 1999, another larger-scale eruption is expected to occur in the immediate future. Cerro Negro does not differ from most volcanoes, in that numerous hazards are associated with volcanic activity. These hazards include lava flows, mudslides, pyroclastic flows, and earthquakes, but the biggest hazard of Cerro Negro is the effects of the ash and tephra fallouts. Currently, Cerro Negro is being monitored by the Nicaraguan Seismic Network, which is affiliated with INETER (Instituto Nicaragüense de Esdudios Territoriales). These programs have a total of 36 stations throughout Nicaragua, and they each have a monitoring station on Cerro Negro. Seismic activity, gas concentrations, surface deformation, and temperature fluctuations are all carefully watched in order to mitigate the effects of a possible eruption. As Cerro Negro lies in a less-populated area of Nicaragua, there is less volcanic risk to human life compared to many of the other volcanoes in the world. Mudslides and pyroclastic flows that come from Cerro Negro are not in the direct path of major cities or towns. Nevertheless, the eruptions of Cerro Negro have been known to cause catastrophic damage to buildings and farmland, due to the widespread ash falls and tephra fallouts.

It is publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. In 2012, it has approximately 3,600 employees and reported an after- tax profit of $90.7 million (pre-significant items). The company has a diversified shareholding with predominantly Australian fund managers and retail owners. The group's corporate headquarters is in North Ryde (Triniti 3 Building), a suburb of Sydney. Founded in Sydney in 1855 as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the company expanded into milling cane in Queensland and Fiji from the 1870s. It quickly became the most important miller and refiner in Australasia, with a virtual monopoly on Queensland and Fiji sugar production up to, respectively, 1989 and 1972. It also sold by-products of the sugar industry, from mollasses to ethanol. In 2010, CSR sold its sugar and ethanol business, which had been given the name Sucrogen in 2009, to the Singaporean company Wilmar. As of 2015, the business is known as Wilmar Sugar. The company began to diversify into building products as early as 1942, with the construction of a plaster mill in Sydney, and in 1947 the company began manufacturing plasterboard there, bringing the product to the Australian market. It acquired Bradford Insulation in 1959, which produced heat insulation materials for buildings, and currently has a substantial share of the insulation market in Australia. It has established insulation businesses in China, Thailand and Malaysia, originally in joint ventures with local partners, but now wholly owned. The company also produces fibre cement sheeting, aerated concrete products, bricks, permanent formwork for walls and systems to support plasterboard construction through Rondo, a joint venture with Boral. It spun off its interests in heavy building products, then producing more than half the group's profits, to a separate listed company, Rinker Group, in 2003. In 2007, CSR acquired the Australasian glass businesses of Pilkington and the Melbourne-based glass processing company DMS Glass, subsequently renaming both as Viridian.  Sugar milling and refining  Founded in Sydney in 1855 as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the company first began refining imported raw sugar, expanding into the Melbourne market in the 1870s. Over the next two decades, mills were established in Queensland and Fiji, which began to process domestically-grown sugar; and in 1891 a large refining complex at Glanville, Adelaide to process sugar from Mauritius. In 1923, the Queensland state government signed an agreement with CSR to refine all of that state's sugar production, a monopoly that was to continue until 1989, 16 years after CSR had left Fiji. At that time, about 80% of production was exported. CSR separated its sugar and energy businesses from its building products business in 2009, which resulted in the creation of Sucrogen as CSR's sugar and energy business. It then operated seven sugar mills in Queensland: Victoria Mill and Macknade Mill in the Herbert River region, centered around the town of Ingham; Invicta Mill, Inkerman Mill, Kalamia Mill and Pioneer Mill in the Burdekin Region; and Plane Creek Mill at Sarina, south of Mackay. CSR also owned a 75% share in the Sugar Australia refineries in Melbourne and Mackay (the other 25% being Mackay Sugar Co-Operative's) and in the Chelsea Sugar Refinery in Auckland. Using the molasses by-product from the sugar mills, the company also distilled ethanol for use in fuel ethanol manufacture, and varying grades of domestic industrial ethanols for food production and other chemical processes. The CSR brand was used on most of the retail sugar products produced. The production made up around 60% of the sugar on the Australian domestic market, and 80% of that in New Zealand. Sucrogen was sold to Singapore company Wilmar International in 2010. Construction and mining In February 1980, CSR acquired construction and mining contractor Thiess in a hostile takeover.Plans for Thiess Canberra Times 1 December 1979 page 20CSR Offer Accepted - Thiess directors give up fight Canberra Times 12 January 1980 page 16 In April 1981, the construction division was sold to a consortium of Hochtief, Westfield Group and Leslie Thiess.Sale to Thiess Canberra Times 3 April 1981 page 16 Wittenoom controversy Between 1948 and 1966, CSR operated mines at Wittenoom, Western Australia that produced 161 000 tons of crocidolite fibre. During this time, thousands of workers and their families, visitors, tourists, consultants and Government officials were exposed to potentially lethal levels of blue asbestos almost a thousand times higher than occupationally regulated at the time. Many of them would develop fatal diseases due to this, such as pleural mesothelioma and lung cancer. Despite warnings from the Western Australia Health Department and other health authorities in the early 1960s, CSR continued to operate the mine until 1966. The first court victory for the Wittenoom victims was in 1988, when Klaus Rabenault won his case against Midalco, a subsidiary of CSR that ran the mines. The judge ruled that CSR acted with 'continuing, conscious and contumelious' disregard for its workers' safety and that Rabenault should be awarded $426,000 by way of compensation and $250,000 in punitive damages.p119. Hills, Ben. Blue Murder (1989) It is predicted that by 2020, almost a third of the people who passed through Wittenoom during the mines' operating years would be diagnosed with a fatal disease caused by their dangerous exposures to blue asbestos. This would be an estimated 2000 cases totaling costs of $500 million (AUS) in damages from CSR.p144-145. Hills, Ben. Blue Murder (1989) In the 1980s CSR was pursued by victims of asbestosis caused by the operation of its Midalco subsidiary in Western Australia. By 1988, 258 damage-related suits had been taken against CSR, though only a handful of cases had been heard in the courts. In May that year a Victorian court made an award of A$680,000 against Midalco to a former worker, after he contracted the fatal lung cancer, mesothelioma; and in August, lesser amounts were awarded to other workers, against CSR itself (22). Finally in 1989 and the following year, a settlement was made. Meanwhile, CSR and the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia were engaged in a dispute as to which of them was responsible for payment of the damages to the workforce and their dependents, with CSR arguing that it was not responsible for liabilities sustained by its Midalco subsidiary. The two bodies finally reached agreement in early 1989 to share the costs of compensation (23). A$15 million would be paid out by each of them to cover damages for the seven-year period of operation of the Wittenoom mine, with an additional total of A$20 million payable to claimants who worked there before 1959 (23). By the end of that year, researchers at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, and the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, in Perth had estimated that a further 692 workers would fall victim to mesothelioma with another 183 cases of lung cancer to be expected. They predicted another 432 successful claims would be made, in addition to the 356 already accepted (24). At the beginning of 1990, 322 workers had been compensated (25). A few months later CSR made a partial re-entry into mining, when it bought up 48 quarries from the US ARC subsidiary of the British Hanson corporation. It also pulled out of a plasterboard joint venture with Redland Plasterboard (established in 1987) while retaining its Australian and New Zealand interests, through Monier PGH - a company with around half of the Australian roofing tile market (26). The mining and milling of blue asbestos at Wittenoom is as of 2004 the greatest single industrial disaster in Australia's history. The song \\"Blue Sky Mine\\" by Australian rock band Midnight Oil is about the disaster.

The river Kennet runs immediately north of the village, separating it from the A4. Local government The parish elects a joint parish council with the adjacent parish of Fyfield; the council is named Fyfield and West Overton. It falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Until the 19th century the parish of Overton had chapelries at Alton Priors and Fyfield, and tithings of East Overton, Lockeridge, Shaw, and West Overton. In the 19th century Alton and Fyfield became separate civil parishes while East Overton ceased to be used as a place name. The village of Shaw, southwest of West Overton, was apparently deserted in the 15th century; Lockeridge continues as a village in West Overton parish. Church and chapel The Anglican Church of St Michael and All Angels was built in 1878 to designs of C.E. Ponting and incorporates some features from the 13th century building it replaced. The church is Grade II* listed. From 1901 to 1966 there was a Methodist chapel at West Overton. Amenities A National School was built at Lockeridge in 1875 to serve the parishes of West Overton and Fyfield. The building (and extensions) continues in use as Kennet Valley C of E Voluntary Aided Primary School. The parish has a village hall, Kennet Valley Village Hall, near Lockeridge. Landmarks North of the A4, the parish extends onto the Marlborough Downs. On Overton Down is an earthwork built in 1960 as a long-term archaeology experiment. The Piggledene valley, with its sarsen stones, is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest managed by the National Trust. Overton Hill, with prehistoric features including The Sanctuary, is to the west of the village and partly in Avebury parish. The ancient Ridgeway, now a national trail, begins here and follows the parish boundary northwards. The medieval Wansdyke earthwork crosses the southernmost part of the parish.

It attempts to carry out quantization, for which there is in general no exact recipe, in such a way that certain analogies between the classical theory and the quantum theory remain manifest. For example, the similarity between the Heisenberg equation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics and the Hamilton equation in classical physics should be built in. Origins One of the earliest attempts at a natural quantization was Weyl quantization, proposed by Hermann Weyl in 1927. Here, an attempt is made to associate a quantum-mechanical observable (a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space) with a real-valued function on classical phase space. The position and momentum in this phase space are mapped to the generators of the Heisenberg group, and the Hilbert space appears as a group representation of the Heisenberg group. In 1946, H. J. Groenewold considered the product of a pair of such observables and asked what the corresponding function would be on the classical phase space. This led him to discover the phase-space star-product of a pair of functions. The modern theory of geometric quantization was developed by Bertram Kostant and Jean-Marie Souriau in the 1970s. One of the motivations of the theory was to understand and generalize Kirillov's orbit method in representation theory. Deformation quantization More generally, this technique leads to deformation quantization, where the ★-product is taken to be a deformation of the algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold or Poisson manifold. However, as a natural quantization scheme (a functor), Weyl's map is not satisfactory. For example, the Weyl map of the classical angular-momentum-squared is not just the quantum angular momentum squared operator, but it further contains a constant term 3ħ2/2. (This extra term is actually physically significant, since it accounts for the nonvanishing angular momentum of the ground-state Bohr orbit in the hydrogen atom.) As a mere representation change, however, Weyl's map underlies the alternate phase- space formulation of conventional quantum mechanics. Geometric quantization The geometric quantization procedure falls into the following three steps: prequantization, polarization, and metaplectic correction. Prequantization produces a natural Hilbert space together with a quantization procedure for observables that exactly transforms Poisson brackets on the classical side into commutators on the quantum side. Nevertheless, the prequantum Hilbert space is generally understood to be \\"too big\\". The idea is that one should then select a Poisson-commuting set of n variables on the 2n-dimensional phase space and consider functions (or, more properly, sections) that depend only on these n variables. The n variables can be either real-valued, resulting in a position-style Hilbert space, or complex-valued, producing something like the Segal–Bargmann space. A polarization is a coordinate-independent description of such a choice of n Poisson-commuting functions. The metaplectic correction (also known as the half-form correction) is a technical modification of the above procedure that is necessary in the case of real polarizations and often convenient for complex polarizations. =Prequantization= Suppose (M,\\\\omega) is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form \\\\omega. Suppose at first that \\\\omega is exact, meaning that there is a globally defined symplectic potential \\\\theta with d\\\\theta=\\\\omega. We can consider the \\"prequantum Hilbert space\\" of square-integrable functions on M (with respect to the Liouville volume measure). For each smooth function f on M, we can define the Kostant–Souriau prequantum operator :Q(f):= - i\\\\hbar\\\\left( X_f +\\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\theta(X_f)\\\\right) +f. where X_f is the Hamiltonian vector field associated to f. More generally, suppose (M,\\\\omega) has the property that the integral of \\\\omega/(2\\\\pi\\\\hbar) over any closed surface is an integer. Then we can construct a line bundle L with connection whose curvature 2-form is \\\\omega/\\\\hbar. In that case, the prequantum Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable sections of L, and we replace the formula for Q(f) above with :Q(f)= - i\\\\hbar abla_{X_f}+f, with abla the connection. The prequantum operators satisfy :[Q(f),Q(g)]=i\\\\hbar Q(\\\\\\\\{ f,g\\\\\\\\} ) for all smooth functions f and g. The construction of the preceding Hilbert space and the operators Q(f) is known as prequantization. =Polarization= The next step in the process of geometric quantization is the choice of a polarization. A polarization is a choice at each point in M a Lagrangian subspace of the complexified tangent space of M. The subspaces should form an integrable distribution, meaning that the commutator of two vector fields lying in the subspace at each point should also lie in the vector field at each point. The quantum (as opposed to prequantum) Hilbert space is the space of sections of L that are covariantly constant in the direction of the polarization. The idea is that in the quantum Hilbert space, the sections should be functions of only n variables on the 2n-dimensional classical phase space. If f is a function for which the associated Hamiltonian flow preserves the polarization, then Q(f) will preserve the quantum Hilbert space. The assumption that the flow of f preserve the polarization is a strong one. Typically not very many functions will satisfy this assumption. =Half-form correction= The half-form correction—also known as the metaplectic correction—is a technical modification to the above procedure that is necessary in the case of real polarizations to obtain a nonzero quantum Hilbert space; it is also often useful in the complex case. The line bundle L is replaced by the tensor product of L with the square root of the canonical bundle of L. In the case of the vertical polarization, for example, instead of considering functions f(x) of x that are independent of p, one considers objects of the form f(x)\\\\sqrt{dx}. The formula for Q(f) must then be supplemented by an additional Lie derivative term. In the case of a complex polarization on the plane, for example, the half-form correction allows the quantization of the harmonic oscillator to reproduce the standard quantum mechanical formula for the energies, (n+1/2)\\\\hbar\\\\omega, with the \\"+1/2\\" coming courtesy of the half-forms. =Poisson manifolds= Geometric quantization of Poisson manifolds and symplectic foliations also is developed. For instance, this is the case of partially integrable and superintegrable Hamiltonian systems and non-autonomous mechanics. Example In the case that the symplectic manifold is the 2-sphere, it can be realized as a coadjoint orbit in \\\\mathfrak{su}(2)^*. Assuming that the area of the sphere is an integer multiple of 2\\\\pi\\\\hbar, we can perform geometric quantization and the resulting Hilbert space carries an irreducible representation of SU(2). In the case that the area of the sphere is 2\\\\pi\\\\hbar, we obtain the two-dimensional spin-½ representation.

Under the direction of Franz Boas he received the first Ph.D. granted in anthropology in the United States from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. After graduating, he taught at Clark, eventually becoming full professor in 1911. Under the auspices of the British Association, his area of specialty was the Kootenay (British Columbia) Indians. He was well known in anthropology for his bibliographic work, compiling the lists of new books and articles that appeared in the early issues of the American Anthropologist and later the Journal of American Folklore. He was editor of the Journal of American Folklore between 1901-1908. His works include: * Report on the Kootenay Indians, (1892) * Languages of the Mississaga Indians, (1892) * The Mythology of the Columbian Discovery, (1893) * Child and Childhood in Folk-Thought, (1896) * The Child: A Study in the Evolution of Man, (1900) * Poems, (1904) He also contributed to the second edition of the New International Encyclopedia on South American Indians and Asiatic peoples, and to 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica on North American Indians.

He generally wrote the melody for Squeeze's songs, while his writing partner, Chris Difford, wrote the lyrics. In addition to his songwriting skills, Tilbrook is respected both as a singer and an accomplished guitarist. He was born in Woolwich, London. Difford and Tilbrook During Squeeze's first hiatus, from approximately 1983 to 1985, Tilbrook wrote, recorded, and toured with Chris Difford, his songwriting partner from Squeeze. Their album, Difford & Tilbrook was originally released in 1984, and remastered and reissued in 2006. Solo career and outside Squeeze Tillbrook contributed guitar on 1976 demos for punk band The Only Ones. Following Squeeze's second breakup in 1999, Tilbrook pursued a solo career, often touring around the UK and US in an RV, playing small venues. He released two solo albums, The Incomplete Glenn Tilbrook and Transatlantic Ping Pong. Tilbrook co-wrote some of the songs for his solo recordings with artists such as Ron Sexsmith, Chris Braide and Aimee Mann. Glenn Tilbrook at the Picturedrome, Yorkshire on 19 May 2007 In 2006, the film documentary Glenn Tilbrook: One for the Road was released.

In April 2007, Tilbrook released The Past Has Been Bottled, the first in a five-disc series of remastered demos. The first release included early versions of tracks from Squeeze's East Side Story. The second volume, In The Sky Above, was released in the UK in November 2007, and covered the period from 1993 through 1998. The third volume, Dreams Are Made of This, was released in November 2009 and covered Squeeze's early years, from 1974 to 1980. The fourth volume \\"When Daylight Appears\\", was released in 2011 and covered the years 1985 to 1991. The fifth volume, \\"Upon The Rocks\\", was released in 2016 and covered the years 1981 to 1984. In 2008, Tilbrook previewed new material while on tour with the Fluffers, two members of whom are also members of the latest Squeeze line-up. A four-track single, \\"Binga Bong!\\", was released in November 2008. The album Pandemonium Ensues, credited to Glenn Tilbrook and The Fluffers, was released in March 2009. The 14-track album was produced by Tilbrook and Andrew J. Jones, and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. It featured guest appearances from Johnny Depp on \\"Too Close to the Sun\\" and Depp's then girlfriend, Vanessa Paradis, on \\"Interest & Love\\". In January 2010 it was announced that Tilbrook and Difford would be spending part of the coming summer in Italy, together writing songs for a new Squeeze album. The result of this was a 4-song CD of new demo recordings which emerged during their 2012 tour of the US. The duo toured the UK and US again in 2014-15 with a program they called 'The At Odds Couple'. In 2014, Tilbrook released a mostly acoustic album titled \\"Happy Ending\\". Later that year, he was featured on the compilation Songs from a Stolen Spring that paired Western musicians with artists from the Arab Spring.

(Reception of the American Loyalists by Great Britain in the Year 1783. Engraving by H. Moses after Benjamin West.) United Empire Loyalist flag Loyalists were American colonists who stayed loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolutionary War, often called Tories, Royalists, or King's Men at the time. They were opposed by the Patriots, who supported the revolution, and called them \\"persons inimical to the liberties of America\\". Prominent Loyalists repeatedly assured the British government that many thousands of them would spring to arms and fight for the crown. The British government acted in expectation of that, especially in the southern campaigns in 1780–81. In practice, the number of Loyalists in military service was far lower than expected since Britain could not effectively protect them except in those areas where Britain had military control. The British were often suspicious of them, not knowing whom they could fully trust in such a conflicted situation; they were often looked down upon. Patriots watched suspected Loyalists very closely and would not tolerate any organized Loyalist opposition. Many outspoken or militarily active Loyalists were forced to flee, especially to their stronghold of New York City. William Franklin, the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader Benjamin Franklin, became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778. He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war, but the number of volunteers was much fewer than London expected. When their cause was defeated, about 15 percent of the Loyalists (65,000–70,000 people) fled to other parts of the British Empire, to Britain itself, or to British North America (now Canada). The southern Loyalists moved mostly to Florida, which had remained loyal to the Crown, and to British Caribbean possessions. Northern Loyalists largely migrated to Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. They called themselves United Empire Loyalists. Most were compensated with Canadian land or British cash distributed through formal claims procedures. Loyalists who left the US received over £3 million or about 37% of their losses from the British government. Loyalists who stayed in the US were generally able to retain their property and become American citizens.Jack P. Greene and J. R.

Till then, I shall recommend a legal, orderly, and prudent resentment\\".Andrews, p.284 Most Americans hoped for a peaceful reconciliation but were forced to choose sides by the Patriots who took control nearly everywhere in the Thirteen Colonies in 1775–76.Jassanoff, ch 1 Motives for Loyalism Yale historian Leonard Woods Larabee has identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative and loyal to the King and to Britain:Leonard Woods Larabee, Conservatism in Early American History (Cornell UP, 1948) pp 164–65 online. * They were older, better established, and resisted radical change. * They felt that rebellion against the Crown – the legitimate government – was morally wrong. * They felt alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning down houses and tarring and feathering. * They wanted to take a middle-of-the-road position and were not pleased when forced by Patriots to declare their opposition. * They had a long-standing sentimental attachment to Britain (often with business and family links). * They felt that independence from Britain would come eventually, but wanted it to come about organically. * They were wary that chaos, corruption, and mob rule would come about as a result of revolution. * Some were “pessimists” who did not display the same belief in the future that the Patriots did. Others recalled the dreadful experiences of many Jacobite rebels after the failure of the last Jacobite rebellion as recently as 1745 who often lost their lands when the Hanoverian government won.See also N.

Other motives of the Loyalists included: * They felt a need for order and believed that Parliament was the legitimate authority.Hull, Hoffer and Allen, \\"Choosing Sides (1978), p, 352 * In New York, powerful families had assembled colony-wide coalitions of supporters, men long associated with the French Huguenot/Dutch De Lancey faction went along when its leadership decided to support the crown.Hull, Hoffer and Allen, \\"Choosing Sides (1978), pp 347, 354, 365 * They felt themselves to be weak or threatened within American society and in need of an outside defender such as the British Crown and Parliament. *Black loyalists had been promised freedom from slavery by the British. * They felt that being a part of the British Empire was crucial in terms of commerce and their business operations. Loyalism and military operations In the opening months of the Revolutionary War, the Patriots laid siege to Boston, where most of the British forces were stationed. Elsewhere there were few British troops and the Patriots seized control of all levels of government, as well as supplies of arms and gunpowder. Vocal Loyalists recruited people to their side, often with the encouragement and assistance of royal governors. In the South Carolina back country, Loyalist recruitment outstripped that of Patriots. A brief siege at Ninety Six, South Carolina in the fall of 1775 was followed by a rapid rise in Patriot recruiting, and a Snow Campaign involving thousands of partisan militia resulted in the arrest or flight of most of the back country Loyalist leadership. North Carolina back country Scots and former Regulators joined forces in early 1776, but they were broken as a force at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. By July 4, 1776, the Patriots had gained control of virtually all territory in the Thirteen Colonies and expelled all royal officials. No one who openly proclaimed their loyalty to the Crown was allowed to remain, so Loyalists fled or kept quiet. Some of those who remained later gave aid to invading British armies or joined uniformed Loyalist regiments.Calhoun (1973) The British were forced out of Boston by March 17, 1776. They regrouped at Halifax and attacked New York in August, defeating George Washington's army at Long Island and capturing New York City and its vicinity, and they occupied the mouth of the Hudson River until 1783. British forces seized control of other cities, including Philadelphia (1777), Savannah, Georgia (1778–83), and Charleston, South Carolina (1780–82). But 90% of the colonial population lived outside the cities, with the effective result that Congress represented 80 to 90 percent of the population. The British removed their governors from colonies where the Patriots were in control, but Loyalist civilian government was re-established in coastal GeorgiaGeorgia Encyclopædia. from 1779 to 1782, despite presence of Patriot forces in the northern part of Georgia. Essentially, the British were only able to maintain power in areas where they had a strong military presence. =Numbers of Loyalists= Historian Robert Calhoon wrote in 2000, concerning the proportion of Loyalists to Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies: A jury finding from Kentucky County, Virginia in July 1780, confiscating lands of two men adjudged to be British subject. Daniel Boone was listed as a member of the jury. Before Calhoon's work, estimates of the Loyalist share of the population were somewhat higher, at about one-third, but these estimates are now rejected as too high by most scholars.John Adams has sometimes been cited as having claimed, in an 1813 letter, that one-third of Americans supported the revolution and one-third were against. However, the passage in question actually refers to the French Revolution of 1789. See also \\"Only 1/3 of Americans Supported the American Revolution?\\", by William Marina. 6-28-2004. Retrieved on July 14, 2008. In 1968 historian Paul H. Smith estimated there were about 400,000 Loyalists, or 16% of the white population of 2.25 million in 1780.Paul H. Smith, \\"The American Loyalists: Notes on Their Organization and Numerical Strength,\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1968) 25#2 pp. 259–277 in JSTOR Historian Robert Middlekauff summarized scholarly research on the nature of Loyalist support as follows: > The largest number of loyalists were found in the middle colonies: many > tenant farmers of New York supported the king, for example, as did many of > the Dutch in the colony and in New Jersey. The Germans in Pennsylvania tried > to stay out of the Revolution, just as many Quakers did, and when that > failed, clung to the familiar connection rather than embrace the new. > Highland Scots in the Carolinas, a fair number of Anglican clergy and their > parishioners in Connecticut and New York, a few Presbyterians in the > southern colonies, and a large number of the Iroquois stayed loyal to the > king.Middlekauff, Robert. The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, > 1763–1789 (1985), p 550. Sir John Johnson in the Mohawk Valley New York City and Long Island were the British military and political base of operations in North America from 1776 to 1783 and had a large concentration of Loyalists, many of whom were refugees from other states.Calhoon (1973) According to Calhoon, Loyalists tended to be older and wealthier, but there were also many Loyalists of humble means. Many active Church of England members became Loyalists. Some recent arrivals from Britain, especially those from Scotland, had a high Loyalist proportion. Loyalists in the southern colonies were suppressed by the local Patriots, who controlled local and state government. Many people—including former Regulators in North Carolina — refused to join the rebellion, as they had earlier protested against corruption by local authorities who later became Revolutionary leaders. The oppression by the local Whigs during the Regulation led to many of the residents of backcountry North Carolina sitting out the Revolution or siding with the Loyalists. In areas under Patriot control, Loyalists were subject to confiscation of property, and outspoken supporters of the king were threatened with public humiliation such as tarring and feathering, or physical attack. It is not known how many Loyalist civilians were harassed by the Patriots, but the treatment was a warning to other Loyalists not to take up arms. In September 1775, William Drayton and Loyalist leader Colonel Thomas Fletchall signed a treaty of neutrality in the interior community of Ninety Six, South Carolina.See online NPS.gov For actively aiding the British army when it occupied Philadelphia, two residents of the city were tried for treason, convicted, and executed by returning Patriot forces. =Slavery and Black Loyalists= A Black Loyalist wood cutter at Shelburne, Nova Scotia in 1788 As a result of the looming crisis in 1775, the Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, issued a proclamation that promised freedom to servants and slaves who were able to bear arms and join his Loyalist Ethiopian Regiment. Many of the slaves in the South joined the Loyalists with intentions of gaining freedom and escaping the South. About 800 did so; some helped rout the Virginia militia at the Battle of Kemp's Landing and fought in the Battle of Great Bridge on the Elizabeth River, wearing the motto \\"Liberty to Slaves\\", but this time they were defeated. The remains of their regiment were then involved in the evacuation of Norfolk, after which they served in the Chesapeake area. Eventually the camp that they had set up there suffered an outbreak of smallpox and other diseases. This took a heavy toll, putting many of them out of action for some time. The survivors joined other British units and continued to serve throughout the war. Black colonials were often the first to come forward to volunteer and a total of 12,000 African Americans served with the British from 1775 to 1783. This forced the rebels to also offer freedom to those who would serve in the Continental Army; however, such promises were often reneged upon by both sides. Americans who gained their freedom by fighting for the British became known as Black Loyalists. The British honored the pledge of freedom in New York City through the efforts of General Guy Carleton, who recorded the names of African Americans who had supported the British in a document called the Book of Negroes, which granted freedom to slaves who had escaped and assisted the British. About 4,000 Black Loyalists went to the British colonies of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where the British promised them land. They founded communities across the two provinces, many of which still exist today. Over 2,500 settled in Birchtown, Nova Scotia, instantly making it the largest free black community in North America. However, the inferior grants of land they were given and the prejudices of white Loyalists in nearby Shelburne who regularly harassed the settlement in events such as the Shelburne Riots in 1784, made life very difficult for the community. In 1791 Britain's Sierra Leone Company offered to transport dissatisfied black Loyalists to the British colony of Sierra Leone in West Africa, with the promise of better land and more equality. About 1,200 left Nova Scotia for Sierra Leone, where they named the capital Freetown. After 1787 they became Sierra Leone's ruling elite. About 400 to 1,000 free blacks who joined the British side in the Revolution went to London and joined the free black community of about 10,000 there. = Loyalist women = While men were out fighting for the Crown, women served at home protecting their land and property. At the end of the war, many loyalist men left America for the shelter of England, leaving their wives and daughters to protect their land The main punishment for Loyalist families was the expropriation of property, but married women were protected under \\"feme covert\\", which meant that they had no political identity and their legal rights were absorbed by their husbands. This created an awkward dilemma for the confiscation committees: confiscating the land of such a woman would punish her for her husband's actions. In fact, many women were punished in this way. Grace Growden Galloway recorded the experience in her diary. Galloway's property was seized by the Rebels and she spent the rest of her life fighting to regain it. It was returned to her heirs in 1783, after she and her husband had died. =Loyalism in Canada and Nova Scotia= Tory Refugees on their way to Canada by Howard Pyle Rebel agents were active in Quebec (which was then frequently called \\"Canada\\", the name of the earlier French province) in the months leading to the outbreak of active hostilities. John Brown, an agent of the Boston Committee of Correspondence, worked with Canadian merchant Thomas Walker and other rebel sympathisers during the winter of 1774–1775 to convince inhabitants to support the actions of the First Continental Congress. However, many of Quebec's inhabitants remained neutral, resisting service to either the British or the Americans. Although some Canadians took up arms in support of the rebellion, the majority remained loyal to the King. French Canadians had been satisfied by the British government's Quebec Act of 1774, which offered religious and linguistic toleration; in general, they did not sympathize with a rebellion that they saw as being led by Protestants from New England, who were their commercial rivals and hereditary enemies. Most of the English-speaking settlers had arrived following the British conquest of Canada in 1759–1760, and were unlikely to support separation from Britain. The older British colonies, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (including what is now New Brunswick) also remained loyal and contributed military forces in support of the Crown. In late 1775 the Continental Army sent a force into Quebec, led by General Richard Montgomery and Colonel Benedict Arnold, with the goal of convincing the residents of Quebec to join the Revolution. Although only a minority of Canadians openly expressed loyalty to King George, about 1,500 militia fought for the King in the Siege of Fort St. Jean. In the region south of Montreal that was occupied by the Continentals, some inhabitants supported the rebellion and raised two regiments to join the Patriot forces.Mason Wade, The French Canadians (1955) 1:67–9. In Nova Scotia, there were many Yankee settlers originally from New England, and they generally supported the principles of the revolution. The allegiance toward the rebellion waned as American Privateers raided Nova Scotia communities throughout the war. As well, the Nova Scotia government used the law to convict people for sedition and treason for supporting the rebel cause. There was also the influence of an influx of recent immigration from the British isles, and they remained neutral during the war, and the influx was greatest in Halifax.George Rawlyck, A People Highly Favoured Of God. The Nova Scotia Yankees. And the American Revolution (Toronto: 1972) Britain in any case built up powerful forces at the naval base of Halifax after the failure of Jonathan Eddy to capture Fort Cumberland in 1776.Philip Buckner and John G Reid, eds. The Atlantic Region to Confederation: A History (1995) pp 168–170J.B. Brebner, The Neutral Yankees of Nova Scotia (1937) Although the Continentals captured Montreal in November 1775, they were turned back a month later at Quebec City by a combination of the British military under Governor Guy Carleton, the difficult terrain and weather, and an indifferent local response. The Continental forces would be driven from Quebec in 1776, after the breakup of ice on the St. Lawrence River and the arrival of British transports in May and June. There would be no further serious attempt to challenge British control of present-day Canada until the War of 1812. In 1777, 1,500 Loyalist militia took part in the Saratoga campaign in New York, and surrendered with General Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga in October. For the rest of the war, Quebec acted as a base for raiding expeditions, conducted primarily by Loyalists and Indians, against frontier communities. =Military service= The Loyalists rarely attempted any political organization. They were often passive unless regular British army units were in the area. The British, however, assumed a highly activist Loyalist community was ready to mobilize and planned much of their strategy around raising Loyalist regiments. The British provincial line, consisting of Americans enlisted on a regular army status, enrolled 19,000 Loyalists (50 units and 312 companies). The maximum strength of the Loyalist provincial line was 9,700 in December 1780.Smith 264–7.Calhoon 502. In all about 19,000 at one time or another were soldiers or militia in British forces.Smith, p 267 Loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the Battle of Camden. The British forces at the Battle of Monck's Corner and the Battle of Lenud's Ferry consisted entirely of Loyalists with the exception of the commanding officer (Banastre Tarleton).Wilson, David. The Southern Strategy (University of South Carolina Press. 2005.) Both white and black Loyalists fought for the British at the Battle of Kemp's Landing in Virginia.Selby, John E; Higginbotham, Don (2007) Emigration from the United States Shelburne, Nova Scotia, a major early destination of Loyalist refugees Historian Maya Jasanoff estimated how many Loyalists departed the U.S. for British North America. She calculates 60,000 in total, including about 50,000 whites (Wallace Brown cites about 80,000 Loyalists in total permanently left the United States.).However Philip Ranlet estimates that only 20,000 adult white Loyalists went to Canada. \\"How Many American Loyalists Left the United States?.\\" Historian 76.2 (2014): 278-307. The majority of them – 36,000 – to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, while about 6,600 went to Quebec and 2,000 to Prince Edward Island. 5,090 white Loyalists went to Florida, bringing along their slaves who numbered about 8,285 (421 whites and 2561 blacks returned to the States from Florida ). When Florida was returned to Spain, however, very few Loyalists remained there. 6,000 whites went to Jamaica and other Caribbean islands notably the Bahamas. About 13,000 went to Britain (including 5,000 free blacks). The total is 60–62,000 whites. A precise figure cannot be known because the records were incomplete and not accurate, and small numbers continued to leave after 1783. The 50,000 or-so white departures represented about 10% of the Loyalists (at 20-25% of the white population). Loyalists (especially soldiers and former officials) could choose evacuation. Loyalists whose roots were not yet deeply embedded in the United States were more likely to leave; older people who had familial bonds and had acquired friends, property, and a degree of social respectability were more likely to remain in the US.Lohrenz (1998) The vast majority of the half-million white Loyalists, about 20-25% of the total number of whites, remained in the U.S. Starting in the mid–1780s a small percentage of those who had left returned to the United States. The exiles amounted to about 2% of the total US population of 3 million at the end of the war in 1783. After 1783 some former Loyalists, especially Germans from Pennsylvania, emigrated to Canada to take advantage of the British government's offer of free land. Many departed the fledgling U.S. because they faced continuing hostility. In another migration-motivated mainly by economic rather than political reasons-The Canadian Encyclopedia, \\"Loyalists\\"; and Liberty's Exiles, Maya Jasanoff, pp. 206–208. more than 20,000 and perhaps as many as 30,000 \\"Late Loyalists\\" arrived in Ontario in the 1790s attracted by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe's policy of land and low taxes, one-fifth those in the US and swearing an oath of allegiance to the King. The 36,000 or so who went to Nova Scotia were not well received by the 17,000 Nova Scotians, who were mostly descendants of New Englanders settled there before the Revolution.Neil MacKinnon, This Unfriendly Soil: The Loyalist Experience in Nova Scotia, 1783–1791 (1989) \\"They [the Loyalists]\\", Colonel Thomas Dundas wrote in 1786, \\"have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of Nova Scotia, who are even more disaffected towards the British Government than any of the new States ever were. This makes me much doubt their remaining long dependent.\\"S.D. Clark, Movements of Political Protest in Canada, 1640–1840 (1959), pp. 150–51 In response, the colony of New Brunswick, until 1784 part of Nova Scotia, was created for the 14,000 who had settled in those parts. Of the 46,000 who went to Canada, 10,000 went to Quebec, especially what is now modern-day Ontario, the rest to Nova Scotia and PEI. Realizing the importance of some type of consideration, on November 9, 1789, Lord Dorchester, the governor of Quebec, declared that it was his wish to \\"put the mark of Honour upon the Families who had adhered to the Unity of the Empire.\\" As a result of Dorchester's statement, the printed militia rolls carried the notation: > Those Loyalists who have adhered to the Unity of the Empire, and joined the > Royal Standard before the Treaty of Separation in the year 1783, and all > their Children and their Descendants by either sex, are to be distinguished > by the following Capitals, affixed to their names: U.E. Alluding to their > great principle The Unity of the Empire. The postnominals \\"U.E.\\" are rarely seen today, but the influence of the Loyalists on the evolution of Canada remains. Their ties to Britain and/or their antipathy to the United States provided the strength needed to keep Canada independent and distinct in North America. The Loyalists' basic distrust of republicanism and \\"mob rule\\" influenced Canada's gradual path to independence. The new British North American provinces of Upper Canada (the forerunner of Ontario) and New Brunswick were founded as places of refuge for the United Empire Loyalists. In an interesting historical twist Peter Matthews, a son of Loyalists, participated in the Upper Canada Rebellion which sought relief from oligarchic British colonial government and pursued American-style Republicanism. He was arrested, tried and executed in Toronto, and later became heralded as a patriot to the movement which led to Canadian self governance. The wealthiest and most prominent Loyalist exiles went to Great Britain to rebuild their careers; many received pensions. Many Southern Loyalists, taking along their slaves, went to the West Indies, particularly to the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas. Certain Loyalists who fled the United States brought their slaves with them to Canada (mostly to areas that later became Ontario and New Brunswick) where slavery was legal. An imperial law in 1790 assured prospective immigrants to Canada that their slaves would remain their property.Patrick Bode, \\"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves.\\" Beaver 1993 73(3): 17–19 However, a law enacted by eminent British lieutenant general and founder of modern Toronto John Graves Simcoe in 1793 entitled the Act Against Slavery tried to suppress slavery in Upper Canada by halting the sale of slaves to the United States, and by freeing slaves upon their escape from the latter into Canada. Simcoe desired to demonstrate the merits of loyalism and abolitionism in Upper Canada in contrast to the nascent republicanism and prominence of slavery in the United States, and, according to historian Stanley R. Mealing: :\\"...he had not only the most articulate faith in its imperial destiny but also the most sympathetic appreciation of the interests and aspirations of its inhabitants\\".Mealing, S. R. « The Enthusiasms of John Graves Simcoe. » Report of the Annual Meeting / Rapports annuels de la Société historique du Canada, volume 37, numéro 1, 1958, p. 50–62. https://doi.org/10.7202/300570arFryer, M. B., & Dracott, C. (1998). John Graves Simcoe, 1752-1806: A biography. Toronto: Dundurn Press. However the actual law was a compromise. According to historian Afua Cooper, Simcoe's law required children in slavery to be freed when they reached age 25 and: :forbade the importation of slaves but, to Simcoe's disappointment, did not grant freedom to adult slaves. Having not been freed by the act, many Canadian slaves fled across the border into the Old Northwest Territory, where slavery had been abolished.Afua Cooper, \\"Acts of Resistance: Black Men and Women Engage Slavery in Upper Canada, 1793-1803\\" Ontario History (Spring 2007) 99#1 pp 5-17. Thousands of Iroquois and other Native Americans were expelled from New York and other states and resettled in Canada. The descendants of one such group of Iroquois, led by Joseph Brant (Thayendenegea), settled at Six Nations of the Grand River, the largest First Nations reserve in Canada. (The remainder, under the leadership of Cornplanter (John Abeel) and members of his family, stayed in New York.) A group of African-American Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia but emigrated again for Sierra Leone after facing discrimination there. Many of the Loyalists were forced to abandon substantial properties to America restoration of or compensation for these lost properties was a major issue during the negotiation of the Jay Treaty in 1794. The British Government eventually settled several thousand claims for more than 3.5 million Pounds Sterling, an enormous sum of money worth at that time. Return of some expatriates The great majority of Loyalists never left the United States; they stayed on and were allowed to be citizens of the new country. Some became nationally prominent leaders, including Samuel Seabury, who was the first Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and Tench Coxe. There was a small, but significant trickle of returnees who found life in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick too difficult. Perhaps 10% of the refugees to New Brunswick returned to the States as did an unknown number from Nova Scotia. Some Massachusetts Tories settled in the Maine District. Nevertheless, the vast majority never returned. Captain Benjamin Hallowell, who as Mandamus Councilor in Massachusetts served as the direct representative of the Crown, was considered by the insurgents as one of the most hated men in the Colony, but as a token of compensation when he returned from England in 1796, his son was allowed to regain the family house. Alexander Hamilton enlisted the help of the Tories (ex-Loyalists) in New York in 1782–85 to forge an alliance with moderate Whigs to wrest the State from the power of the Clinton faction. Moderate Whigs in other States who had not been in favor of separation from Britain but preferred a negotiated settlement which would have maintained ties to the Mother Country mobilized to block radicals. Most States had rescinded anti- Tory laws by 1787, although the accusation of being a Tory was heard for another generation. Several hundred who had left for Florida returned to Georgia in 1783–84. South Carolina which had seen a bitter bloody internal civil war in 1780-82 adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained behind. The state government successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. During the war, pardons were offered to Loyalists who switched sides and joined the Patriot forces. Others were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of the property. The legislature named 232 Loyalists liable for confiscation of their property, but most appealed and were forgiven.Rebecca Brannon, From Revolution to Reunion: The Reintegration of the South Carolina Loyalists (Univ of South Carolina Press, 2016). In Connecticut much to the disgust of the Radical Whigs the moderate Whigs were advertising in New York newspapers in 1782-83 that Tories who would make no trouble would be welcome on the grounds that their skills and money would help the State's economy. The Moderates prevailed. All anti-Tory laws were repealed in early 1783 except for the law relating to confiscated Tory estates: \\"... the problem of the loyalists after 1783 was resolved in their favor after the War of Independence ended.\\" In 1787 the last of any discriminatory laws were rescinded. Impact of the departure of Loyalist leaders The departure of so many royal officials, rich merchants and landed gentry destroyed the hierarchical networks that had dominated most of the colonies. A major result was that a Patriot/Whig elite supplanted royal officials and affluent Tories.The Forging of the New Nation, 1781-1789, Robert B. Morris, 1987, p. 163. In New York, the departure of key members of the De Lancey, De Peyster, Walton and Cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the Hudson Valley. Likewise in Pennsylvania, the departure of powerful families—Penn, Allen, Chew, Shippen—destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class there. Massachusetts passed an act banishing forty-six Boston merchants in 1778, including members of some of Boston's wealthiest families. The departure of families such as the Ervings, Winslows, Clarks, and Lloyds deprived Massachusetts of men who had hitherto been leaders of networks of family and clients. The bases of the men who replaced them were much different. One rich Patriot in Boston noted in 1779 that \\"fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago, have amassed fortunes and are riding in chariots.\\" New men became rich merchants but they shared a spirit of republican equality that replaced the former elitism. The Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric. Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon Patriots had to fight against. Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war most remained in the new nation. By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \\"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\\"Francis Cogliano, No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155. online Loyalists in art * John Singleton Copley painted many prominent Loyalists and produced an oil-on-canvas depiction of a soldier wearing the uniform of the Royal Ethiopian Regiment (a regiment composed of black Loyalist soldiers) in The Death of Major Pierson (1784). * Benjamin West characterized the ethnic and economic diversity of the Loyalists in his Reception of the American Loyalists by Great Britain in the Year 1783.

Concepción is an active stratovolcano that forms the northwest part of the Isla de Ometepe. Concepción is tall and rests on a 1 km (3,300ft) thick base of Quaternary lacustrine mudstones. It is considered a \\"pristine\\" volcano because there has been no influence of other volcanoes on its growth. The growth of the volcano comes in phases based on weaknesses of the crust that the volcano rests on. As it grows from additional magma flow, the volcano grows in mass and exerts pressure on the crust. This causes shifts which in turn cause more volcanic growth. This affects the magma chamber which begins the cycle again with growth because of magmatic flow. Since 1883, Concepción has erupted at least 25 times; its last eruption was on 9 March 2010. Concepción's eruptions are characterized by frequent, moderate-sized explosions. Active fumaroles are present just north of Concepción's summit crater. Adventure seekers from all over the world travel to Ometepe Island to climb Volcán Concepción. There are numerous trails in the tropical forest that surrounds the volcano's ash-covered peak.

These algebras form a generalization of finite- dimensional semisimple Lie algebras, and many properties related to the structure of a Lie algebra such as its root system, irreducible representations, and connection to flag manifolds have natural analogues in the Kac–Moody setting. A class of Kac–Moody algebras called affine Lie algebras is of particular importance in mathematics and theoretical physics, especially two-dimensional conformal field theory and the theory of exactly solvable models. Kac discovered an elegant proof of certain combinatorial identities, the Macdonald identities, which is based on the representation theory of affine Kac–Moody algebras. Howard Garland and James Lepowsky demonstrated that Rogers–Ramanujan identities can be derived in a similar fashion.(?)  History of Kac–Moody algebras  The initial construction by Élie Cartan and Wilhelm Killing of finite dimensional simple Lie algebras from the Cartan integers was type dependent. In 1966 Jean-Pierre Serre showed that relations of Claude Chevalley and Harish-Chandra, with simplifications by Nathan Jacobson, give a defining presentation for the Lie algebra. One could thus describe a simple Lie algebra in terms of generators and relations using data from the matrix of Cartan integers, which is naturally positive definite. \\"Almost simultaneously in 1967, Victor Kac in the USSR and Robert Moody in Canada developed what was to become Kac–Moody algebra. Kac and Moody noticed that if Wilhelm Killing's conditions were relaxed, it was still possible to associate to the Cartan matrix a Lie algebra which, necessarily, would be infinite dimensional.\\" – A. J. ColemanColeman, A. John, \\"The Greatest Mathematical Paper of All Time,\\" The Mathematical Intelligencer, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 29–38. In his 1967 thesis, Robert Moody considered Lie algebras whose Cartan matrix is no longer positive definite.Moody 1968, A new class of Lie algebras This still gave rise to a Lie algebra, but one which is now infinite dimensional. Simultaneously, Z-graded Lie algebras were being studied in Moscow where I. L. Kantor introduced and studied a general class of Lie algebras including what eventually became known as Kac–Moody algebras. Victor Kac was also studying simple or nearly simple Lie algebras with polynomial growth. A rich mathematical theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras evolved. An account of the subject, which also includes works of many others is given in (Kac 1990).Kac, 1990 See also (Seligman 1987). Definition A Kac–Moody algebra may be defined by first giving the following: # An n×n generalized Cartan matrix of rank r. # A vector space \\\\mathfrak{h} over the complex numbers of dimension 2n − r. # A set of n linearly independent elements \\\\alpha_i^\\\\vee of \\\\mathfrak{h} and a set of n linearly independent elements \\\\alpha_i of the dual space \\\\mathfrak{h}^*, such that \\\\alpha_i\\\\left(\\\\alpha_j^\\\\vee\\\\right) = c_{ji}. The \\\\alpha_i are analogue to the simple roots of a semi-simple Lie algebra, and the \\\\alpha_i^\\\\vee to the simple coroots. The Kac–Moody algebra is then the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} defined by generators e_i and f_i \\\\left(i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\\\\\}\\\\right) and the elements of \\\\mathfrak{h} and relations *\\\\left[h, h'\\\\right] = 0\\\\ for h,h' \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}; *\\\\left[h, e_i\\\\right] = \\\\alpha_i(h)e_i, for h \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}; *\\\\left[h, f_i\\\\right] = -\\\\alpha_i(h)f_i, for h \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}; *\\\\left[e_i, f_j\\\\right] = \\\\delta_{ij}\\\\alpha_i^\\\\vee , where \\\\delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta; *If i eq j (so c_{ij} \\\\leq 0) then \\\\textrm{ad}(e_i)^{1-c_{ij}}(e_j) = 0 and \\\\operatorname{ad}(f_i)^{1-c_{ij}}(f_j) = 0, where \\\\operatorname{ad}: \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\to\\\\operatorname{End}(\\\\mathfrak{g}),\\\\operatorname{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y], is the adjoint representation of \\\\mathfrak{g}. A real (possibly infinite- dimensional) Lie algebra is also considered a Kac–Moody algebra if its complexification is a Kac–Moody algebra. Root-space decomposition of a Kac–Moody algebra \\\\mathfrak{h} is the analogue of a Cartan subalgebra for the Kac–Moody algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}. If x eq 0 is an element of \\\\mathfrak{g} such that :\\\\forall h\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{h}, [h, x] = \\\\lambda(h)x for some \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{h}^*\\\\backslash\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, then x is called a root vector and \\\\lambda is a root of \\\\mathfrak{g}. (The zero functional is not considered a root by convention.) The set of all roots of \\\\mathfrak{g} is often denoted by \\\\Delta and sometimes by R. For a given root \\\\lambda, one denotes by \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\lambda the root space of \\\\lambda; that is, :\\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\lambda = \\\\\\\\{x\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{g}:\\\\forall h\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{h}, [h,x] = \\\\lambda(h)x\\\\\\\\}. It follows from the defining relations of \\\\mathfrak{g} that e_i\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\alpha_i} and f_i\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{g}_{-\\\\alpha_i}. Also, if x_1\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_1} and x_2\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_2}, then \\\\left[x_1, x_2\\\\right]\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\lambda_1+\\\\lambda_2} by the Jacobi identity. A fundamental result of the theory is that any Kac–Moody algebra can be decomposed into the direct sum of \\\\mathfrak{h} and its root spaces, that is :\\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\oplus\\\\bigoplus_{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\Delta} \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\lambda, and that every root \\\\lambda can be written as \\\\lambda = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i\\\\alpha_i with all the z_i being integers of the same sign. Types of Kac–Moody algebras Properties of a Kac–Moody algebra are controlled by the algebraic properties of its generalized Cartan matrix C. In order to classify Kac–Moody algebras, it is enough to consider the case of an indecomposable matrix C, that is, assume that there is no decomposition of the set of indices I into a disjoint union of non-empty subsets I1 and I2 such that Cij = 0 for all i in I1 and j in I2. Any decomposition of the generalized Cartan matrix leads to the direct sum decomposition of the corresponding Kac–Moody algebra: : \\\\mathfrak{g}(C) \\\\simeq \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\left(C_1\\\\right) \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\left(C_2\\\\right), where the two Kac–Moody algebras in the right hand side are associated with the submatrices of C corresponding to the index sets I1 and I2. An important subclass of Kac–Moody algebras corresponds to symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrices C, which can be decomposed as DS, where D is a diagonal matrix with positive integer entries and S is a symmetric matrix. Under the assumptions that C is symmetrizable and indecomposable, the Kac–Moody algebras are divided into three classes: *A positive definite matrix S gives rise to a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. *A positive semidefinite matrix S gives rise to an infinite- dimensional Kac–Moody algebra of affine type, or an affine Lie algebra. *An indefinite matrix S gives rise to a Kac–Moody algebra of indefinite type. *Since the diagonal entries of C and S are positive, S cannot be negative definite or negative semidefinite. Symmetrizable indecomposable generalized Cartan matrices of finite and affine type have been completely classified. They correspond to Dynkin diagrams and affine Dynkin diagrams. Little is known about the Kac–Moody algebras of indefinite type, although the groups corresponding to these Kac–Moody algebras were constructed over arbitrary fields by Jacques Tits. Among the Kac–Moody algebras of indefinite type, most work has focused on those hyperbolic type, for which the matrix S is indefinite, but for each proper subset of I, the corresponding submatrix is positive definite or positive semidefinite. Hyperbolic Kac–Moody algebras have rank at most 10, and they have been completely classified. There are infinitely many of rank 2, and 238 of ranks between 3 and 10.

The German wireless installations were ordered to be destroyed because they were used by Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy, which threatened merchant shipping in the region. Following the capture of German possessions in the region, the AN&MEF; provided occupation forces for the duration of the war. New Zealand provided a similar force for the occupation of German Samoa. History Australian Machine Gun Section training, Palm Island, F. S. Burnell State Library of New South Wales, PXA 2165 =Formation= The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF;) began forming following a request by the British government on 6 August 1914.Grey 2008, p. 86. The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands, Nauru and at Rabaul, New Britain. The force was assembled under the guidance of Colonel James Legge, and was separate from the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) forming under Major General William Bridges.Grey 2008, pp. 87–88. The AN&MEF; comprised one battalion of infantry of 1,000 men enlisted in Sydney, plus 500 naval reservists and ex- sailors who would serve as infantry.Grey 2008, p. 87. The 1st Battalion, AN&MEF; was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Watson, while the naval reservists were formed into six companies under Commander Joseph Beresford.MacKenzie 1941, pp. 25–28. Also included were two machine gun sections, a signals section and a medical detachment.Kuring 2004, p. 44. Another battalion of militia from the Queensland-based Kennedy Regiment, which had been hurriedly dispatched to garrison Thursday Island, also contributed 500 volunteers to the force.Mackenzie 1941, pp. 23–35. Recruitment began on 11 August, with the very few of the infantry having had previous military experience. Embarkation of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in Sydney Under the overall command of Colonel William Holmes, the AN&MEF; departed Sydney on 19 August aboard HMAS Berrima and halted at Palm Island off Townsville until the New Zealand force, escorted by the battlecruiser , cruiser , and the French cruiser Montcalm, occupied Samoa on 30 August. The AN&MEF; then moved to Port Moresby where it met the Queensland contingent aboard the transport TSS Kanowna. The force then sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September but the Kanowna was left behind when her stokers refused to work.Mackenzie 1941, p. 32. The soldiers from the Kennedy Regiment were also left in Port Moresby as Holmes felt that they were not trained or equipped well enough to be committed to the fighting that was expected.Mackenzie 1941, p. 31. =Landing at Rabaul= Off the eastern tip of New Guinea, the Berrima rendezvoused with Australia and the light cruiser plus some destroyers. Melbourne had been detached to destroy the wireless station on Nauru. The task force reached Rabaul on 11 September, finding the port free of German forces. Sydney and the destroyer landed small parties of naval reservists at the settlements of Kabakaul and the German gubernatorial capital Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo) on Neu-Pommern (now New Britain), south-east of Rabaul. These parties were reinforced firstly by sailors from Warrego and later by infantry from Berrima. A small 25-man force of naval reservists was subsequently landed at Kabakaul Bay and proceeded inland to capture the radio station believed to be in operation at Bita Paka, to the south.Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 96. The Australians were resisted by a mixed force of German reservists and Melanesian native police, who forced them to fight their way to the objective. By nightfall the radio station was reached, and it was found to have been abandoned. The mast had been dropped but its instruments and machinery were still intact. During the fighting at Bita Paka seven Australians were killed and five wounded, while the defenders lost one German NCO and about 30 Melanesians killed, and one German and 10 Melanesians wounded. Later it was alleged that the heavy losses among the Melanesian troops was the result of the Australians bayoneting all those they had captured during the fighting.Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 97. As a result of this engagement Seaman W.G.V. Williams became the first Australian fatality of the war.Calkins 2005, p. 881. At nightfall on 12 September, Berrima landed the AN&MEF; infantry battalion at Rabaul. The following afternoon, despite the fact that the German governor had not surrendered the territory, a ceremony was carried out to signal the British occupation of New Britain. The German administration had withdrawn inland to Toma and at dawn on 14 September, bombarded a ridge near the town, while half a battalion advanced towards the town, supported by a field gun.Bean 1946, p. 36. =German surrender= A German 7.7 cm FK 96 artillery piece captured at Rabaul, displayed at the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre, Sydney The show of Australian firepower was sufficient to start negotiations, ending the Siege of Toma. Terms were signed on 17 September and all military resistance ceased, with the remaining 40 German soldiers and 110 natives surrendering on 21 September.Odgers 1994, p.42. The German colony at Madang on Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (the New Guinea mainland) was occupied on 24 September but the German auxiliary cruiser SMS Cormoran, which was lurking nearby, escaped undetected.Bean 1946, p. 38. Over the next two months the remaining outposts were occupied. The terms of the surrender allowed the colony's governor, Dr Eduard Haber, to return to Germany while German civilians were allowed to remain as long as they swore an oath of neutrality. Those who refused were transported to Australia from where they could freely travel back to Germany.Bean 1946, p. 37. Although successful the operation was not well managed, and the Australians had been effectively delayed by a half-trained force. Regardless, the Australians had prevailed not least of all because of their unexpected ability to fight close terrain, while the outflanking of the German positions had unnerved their opponents.Grey 1999, p. 83. The losses of the AN&MEF; were light in the context of later operations but were sufficiently heavy given the relatively modest gain. These losses were further compounded by the disappearance of the Australian submarine during a patrol off Rabaul on 14 September, with 35 men aboard. =Occupation= Australian soldiers hoisting the Union Jack at Kieta on Bougainville Island Following the capture of German possessions in the region, the AN&MEF; provided occupation forces for the duration of the war.Mackenzie 1941, pp. 105–126. A military government was subsequently set up by Holmes.Dennis et al 2008, p. 235. On 9 January 1915,MacKenzie 1941, p. 189. Holmes handed over command of the AN&MEF; to Brigadier General Sir Samuel Pethebridge, the former Secretary of the Department of Defence.MacKenzie 1941, pp. 154–155. Holmes returned to Australia in early 1915 and re-enlisted in the AIF, as did most of his men. Many later served in Egypt, Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine and on the Western Front. A large number became casualties, including Holmes, who was killed in action in 1917.Beaumont 1995, p. 8.MacKenzie 1941, p. 24. They were replaced by the 3rd Battalion, AN&MEF;, which was known as the \\"Tropical Force\\" because it had been specially enlisted for service in the tropics. The size of the garrison at this time was set at a total of 600 men.Rowley 1958, p. 18. Following the end of hostilities in November 1918 the role of the AN&MEF; in the former German colonies in New Guinea had become primarily one of civil administration, although it continued to provide a garrison for the next two and a half years.Rowley 1958, p. 30. The military government continued until 1921 when Australia received a mandate from the League of Nations to govern the territory. Although the AN&MEF; had seen no further action following the initial seizure of the colony, in the years that followed the climate and a range of tropical diseases, such as malaria, had resulted in dozens of fatalities before the deployment concluded.Threlfall 2008, p. 22.Piggott 1988, p. 8. A total of 3,011 men served in the AN&MEF.; Although interrupted by Japanese occupation between 1942–45, Australian administration lasted until 1975 when Papua New Guinea gained its independence.

Mathematically these are Lie algebras consisting of smooth maps from a manifold into a finite dimensional Lie algebra. History The original current algebra, proposed in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann, described weak and electromagnetic currents of the strongly interacting particles, hadrons, leading to the Adler–Weisberger formula and other important physical results. The basic concept, in the era just preceding quantum chromodynamics, was that even without knowing the Lagrangian governing hadron dynamics in detail, exact kinematical information – the local symmetry – could still be encoded in an algebra of currents. The commutators involved in current algebra amount to an infinite-dimensional extension of the Jordan map, where the quantum fields represent infinite arrays of oscillators. Current algebraic techniques are still part of the shared background of particle physics when analyzing symmetries and indispensable in discussions of the Goldstone theorem. Example In a non-Abelian Yang–Mills symmetry, where and are flavor-current and axial-current densities, respectively, the paradigm of a current algebra isGell-Mann, M. (1964). \\"The Symmetry group of vector and axial vector currents\\", Physics 1, 63. : [V^a(\\\\vec{x}),V^b(\\\\vec{y})]=if^{ab}_c\\\\delta(\\\\vec{x}-\\\\vec{y})V^c(\\\\vec{x}), and : [V^a(\\\\vec{x}),A^b(\\\\vec{y})]=if^{ab}_c\\\\delta(\\\\vec{x}-\\\\vec{y})A^c(\\\\vec{x}),\\\\qquad [A^a(\\\\vec{x}),A^b(\\\\vec{y})]=if^{ab}_c\\\\delta(\\\\vec{x}-\\\\vec{y})V^c(\\\\vec{x})~, where are the structure constants of the Lie algebra. To get meaningful expressions, these must be normal ordered. The algebra resolves to a direct sum of two algebras, L and R, upon defining : 2L^a(\\\\vec{x})\\\\equiv V^a(\\\\vec{x})-A^a(\\\\vec{x}), \\\\qquad 2 R^a(\\\\vec{x})\\\\equiv V^a(\\\\vec{x})+A^a(\\\\vec{x}), whereupon [L^a(\\\\vec{x}),L^b(\\\\vec{y})]=if^{ab}_c\\\\delta(\\\\vec{x}-\\\\vec{y})L^c(\\\\vec{x}),\\\\quad [L^a(\\\\vec{x}),R^b(\\\\vec{y})]=0,\\\\quad [R^a(\\\\vec{x}),R^b(\\\\vec{y})]=if^{ab}_c\\\\delta(\\\\vec{x}-\\\\vec{y})R^c(\\\\vec{x})~. Conformal field theory For the case where space is a one-dimensional circle, current algebras arise naturally as a central extension of the loop algebra, known as Kac–Moody algebras or, more specifically, affine Lie algebras. In this case, the commutator and normal ordering can be given a very precise mathematical definition in terms of integration contours on the complex plane, thus avoiding some of the formal divergence difficulties commonly encountered in quantum field theory. When the Killing form of the Lie algebra is contracted with the current commutator, one obtains the energy–momentum tensor of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. When this tensor is expanded as a Laurent series, the resulting algebra is called the Virasoro algebra. This calculation is known as the Sugawara construction. The general case is formalized as the vertex operator algebra.

She is best known for her novels set in Victorian society and featuring lesbian protagonists, such as Tipping the Velvet and Fingersmith. Personal life =Childhood= Sarah Waters was born in Neyland, Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1966. She later moved to Middlesbrough when she was eight years old. She grew up in a family that included her father Ron, mother Mary, and a sister. Her mother was a housewife and her father an engineer who worked on oil refineries. She describes her family as \\"pretty idyllic, very safe and nurturing\\". Her father, \\"a fantastically creative person\\", encouraged her to build and invent. Waters said, \\"When I picture myself as a child, I see myself constructing something, out of plasticine or papier-mâché or Meccano; I used to enjoy writing poems and stories, too.\\" She wrote stories and poems that she describes as \\"dreadful gothic pastiches\\", but had not planned her career. Despite her obvious enjoyment of writing, she did not feel any special calling or preference for becoming a novelist in her youth. Waters was a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, joining as a result of her boyfriend at the time.Sunday, 8 Jun 2008, The South Bank Show: Sarah Waters She has politically always identified herself as on the left of the political spectrum. =Education= After Milford Haven Grammar School, Waters attended university and earned degrees in English literature. She received a BA from the University of Kent, an MA from Lancaster University, and a PhD from Queen Mary, University of London. Her PhD thesis, entitled Wolfskins and togas : lesbian and gay historical fictions, 1870 to the present,The thesis can be downloaded from the British Library's EthOS Archive: uk.bl.ethos.393332 served as inspiration and material for future books. As part of her research she read 19th-century pornography, in which she came across the title of her first book, Tipping the Velvet. However, her literary influences are also found in the popular classics of Victorian literature, such as Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins and the Brontës, and in the contemporary novelists that combine a keen interest in Victoriana with a post-modernist approach to fiction, especially A.S. Byatt and John Fowles. Angela Carter's 'Nights at the Circus' had a huge influence on her début novel as well, and Waters praises her for her literary prose, her \\"common touch\\", and her commitment to feminism. =Daily life= Waters lives in Kennington, south-east London. Career Before writing novels, Waters worked as an academic, earning a doctorate and teaching. Waters went directly from her doctoral thesis to her first novel. It was during the process of writing her thesis that she thought she would write a novel; she began as soon as the thesis was complete. Her work is very research-intensive, which is an aspect she enjoys. Waters was briefly a member of the long-running London North Writers circle, whose members have included the novelists Charles Palliser and Neil Blackmore, among others. With the exception of The Little Stranger, all of her books contain lesbian themes, and she does not mind being labelled a lesbian writer. She said, \\"I'm writing with a clear lesbian agenda in the novels. It's right there at the heart of the books.\\" Despite this \\"common agenda in teasing out lesbian stories from parts of history that are regarded as quite heterosexual\\", she also calls her lesbian protagonists \\"incidental\\", due to her own sexual orientation. \\"That's how it is in my life, and that's how it is, really, for most lesbian and gay people, isn't it? It's sort of just there in your life.\\" Her writing influences include Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Mary Shelley, the Brontës, John Fowles, A. S. Byatt, and Angela Carter =Tipping the Velvet (1998)= Her debut work was the Victorian picaresque Tipping the Velvet, published by Virago in 1998. The novel took 18 months to write. The book takes its title from Victorian slang for cunnilingus. Waters describes the novel as a \\"very upbeat [...] kind of a romp\\". It won a 1999 Betty Trask Award, and was shortlisted for the Mail on Sunday / John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. In 2002, the novel was adapted into a three-part television serial of the same name for BBC Two. It has been translated into at least 24 languages, including Chinese, Latvian, Hungarian, Korean and Slovenian. =Affinity (1999)= Waters's second book, Affinity, was published a year after her first, in 1999. The novel, also set in the Victorian era, centres on the world of Victorian Spiritualism. While finishing her debut novel, Waters had been working on an academic paper on spiritualism. She combined her interests in spiritualism, prisons, and the Victorian era in Affinity, which tells the story of the relationship between an upper-middle- class woman and an imprisoned spiritualist. The novel is less light-hearted than the ones that preceded and followed it. Waters found it less enjoyable to write. \\"It was a very gloomy world to have to go into every day\\", she said. Affinity won the Stonewall Book Award and Somerset Maugham Award. Andrew Davies wrote a screenplay adapting Affinity and the resulting feature film premiered 19 June 2008 at the opening night of Frameline the San Francisco LGBT Film Festival at the Castro Theater. =Fingersmith (2002)= Fingersmith was published in 2002. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Orange Prize. Fingersmith was made into a serial for BBC One in 2005, starring Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy and Imelda Staunton. Waters approved of the adaptation, calling it \\"a really good quality show\\", and said it was \\"very faithful to the book. It was spookily faithful to the book at times, which was exciting.\\" The novel was later adapted again by South Korean director Park Chan-wook into the 2016 film The Handmaiden, which set the story in South Korea in the 1930s. Fingersmith was named by singer and artist David Bowie as one of his \\"top 100 books\\". =The Night Watch (2006)= The Night Watch took four years for Waters to write. It differs from the first three novels in its time period and its structure. Although her thesis and previous books focused on the 19th century, Waters said that \\"Something about the 1940s called to me\\". It was also less tightly plotted than her other books. Waters said, The novel tells the stories of a man and three women in 1940s London. Waters describes it as \\"fundamentally a novel about disappointment and loss and betrayal\\", as well as \\"real contact between people and genuine intimacy\\". In 2005, Waters received the highest bid (£1,000) during a charity auction in which the prize was the opportunity to have the winner's name immortalised in The Night Watch. The auction featured many notable British novelists, and the name of the bidder, author Martina Cole, appeared in Waters' novel. The Night Watch was adapted for television by BBC2 and broadcast on 12 July 2011. = The Little Stranger (2009) = Also set in the 1940s, The Little Stranger also differs from Waters' previous novels. It is her first with no overtly lesbian characters. Initially, Waters set out to write a book about the economic changes brought by socialism in postwar Britain, and reviewers note the connection with Evelyn Waugh.Didock, Barry (30 May 2009). \\"Capturing the spirit of the age: A haunting novel evokes the claustrophobia of postwar Britain\\", The Herald (Glasgow), p. 9. During the novel's construction, it turned into a ghost story, focusing on a family of gentry who own a large country house they can no longer afford to maintain. =The Paying Guests (2014)= This novel is set in the 1920s, in the social and economic aftermath of World War I. Households are in reduced circumstances and Frances Wray and her mother have to take in lodgers to keep going. The developing lesbian relationship between Frances and lodger Lilian Barber provides a complex backdrop for a murder investigation that takes up the latter half of the book. The Observer said: \\"The inimitable Sarah Waters handles a dramatic key change with aplomb in her new novel set in 1920s south London\\". The Telegraph described it as \\"eerie, virtuoso writing\\". Honours and awards Waters was named as one of Granta's 20 Best of Young British Writers in January 2003. The same year, she received the South Bank Award for Literature. She was named Author of the Year at the 2003 British Book Awards. In both 2006 and 2009 she won \\"Writer of the Year\\" at the annual Stonewall Awards. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2009. She holds an honorary degree from Lancaster University. She has featured on the Pinc List of leading Welsh LGBT figures. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to literature. Each of her novels has received awards as well. =Tipping the Velvet= * Betty Trask Award, 1999 * Library Journal's Best Book of the Year, 1999 * Mail on Sunday/John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, 1999 * New York Times Notable Book of the Year Award, 1999 * Ferro-Grumley Award for Lesbian and Gay Fiction (shortlist), 2000 * Lambda Literary Award for Fiction, 2000 =Affinity= * Stonewall Book Award (American Library Association GLBT Roundtable Book Award), 2000 * Arts Council of Wales Book of the Year Award (shortlist), 2000 * Ferro-Grumley Award for Lesbian and Gay Fiction, 2000 * Lambda Literary Award for Fiction (shortlist), 2000 * Mail on Sunday/John Llewellyn Rhys Prize (shortlist), 2000 * Somerset Maugham Award, 2000 * Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award, 2000 * The Best Translated Crime Fiction of the Year in Japan, Kono Mystery ga Sugoi! 2004 =Fingersmith= * Crime Writers' Association Ellis Peters Historical Dagger, 2002 * Man Booker Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2002 * Orange Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2002 * British Book Awards Author of the Year, 2003 * The Best Translated Crime Fiction of the Year in Japan, Kono Mystery ga Sugoi! 2005 =The Night Watch= * Man Booker Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2006 * Orange Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2006 * Lambda Literary Award, 2007 =The Little Stranger= * Man Booker Prize for Fiction (shortlist), 2009 * Nominee for Shirley Jackson Award, 2009 =The Paying Guests= * Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction (shortlist) 2015 Bibliography =Non-fiction=  = Novels = * Tipping the Velvet, 1998 * Affinity, 1999 * Fingersmith, 2002 * The Night Watch, 2006 * The Little Stranger, 2009 * The Paying Guests, 2014 =Critical studies and reviews of Waters' work= * Adaptations =Television= * Tipping the Velvet (2002), BBC Two * Fingersmith (2005), BBC One * Affinity (2008), ITV1 * The Night Watch (2011), BBC Two =Stage= * Tipping the Velvet (2015) = Film = *The Handmaiden (2016) *The Little Stranger (2018)  References  External links *Official website *British Council Biography and Bibliography *Virago Profile Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Lancaster University Category:Alumni of Queen Mary University of London Category:Alumni of the University of Kent Category:British Book Award winners Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature Category:Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction winners Category:Lesbian writers Category:LGBT writers from Wales Category:People from Pembrokeshire Category:Welsh women novelists Category:People educated at Milford Haven School Category:LGBT novelists Category:People from Milford Haven Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Sarah Waters"},{"id":"1146300","text":"With a height of , Maderas is the smaller of the two volcanoes which make up the island of Ometepe, situated in Lake Nicaragua in Nicaragua, Central America. Unlike Concepción, the other volcano on the island, Maderas has not been active in historical times. Its crater contains a crater lake. The slopes of Maderas are one of the few places on the Pacific side of Nicaragua where cloud forest grows. The only other place where this is found is at the Mombacho volcano. Cloud forests are characterized by a rich plant and animal life, made possible by the high levels of humidity in the climate. Prehistoric petroglyphs have been found at the Maderas volcano. Climbing to the top of the volcano is a popular tourist activity. Tourists are strongly encouraged by local guiding companies to hire a guide, but the trail from the common starting point at Finca Magdalena is obvious the entire way to the top. The hike to the top of the crater can be difficult, with steep inclines that get muddy when it rains. It rains often on Ometepe Island, so a slippery climb is likely, even in the dry season. The round trip hike takes between 6 and 9 hours and changes from dry forest to humid forest to cloud forest. There are a number of interesting species that dwell on the volcano, including the white-faced monkey, mountain crab, howler monkeys, and a number of butterflies including the well-known blue morphos.

It can be used for the temporary collection and storage of feces, excreta or fecal sludge as part of an on-site sanitation system and has some similarities with septic tanks or with soak pits. Traditionally, it was a deep cylindrical chamber dug into the ground, having approximate dimensions of 1 metre diameter and 2–3 metres depth. Their appearance was similar to that of a hand-dug water well. The pit can be lined with bricks or concrete, covered with a slab and needing to be emptied frequently when it is used like an underground holding tank. In other cases (if soil and groundwater conditions allow), it is not constructed watertight, to allow liquid to leach out (similar to a pit latrine or to a soak pit).  Uses  An empty, old cesspool in Slovakia = Holding tank = In the UK a cesspit is a sealed tank for the reception and temporary storage of sewage; in North America this is simply referred to as a \\"holding tank\\". Because it is sealed, the tank must be emptied frequently — in many cases as often as weekly. Because of the need for frequent emptying, the cost of maintenance of a cesspit can be very high. = Infiltration systems = A cesspool was at one time built like a dry well lined with loose-fitting brick or stone, used for the disposal of sewage via infiltration into the soil. Liquids leaked out through the soil as conditions allowed, while solids decayed and collected as composted matter in the base of the cesspool. As the solids accumulated, eventually the particulate solids blocked the escape of liquids, causing the cesspool to drain more slowly or to overflow. A biofilm forms in the loose soil surrounding a cesspool or pit latrine which provides some degree of attenuation of the pollutants present, but a very deep cesspool can allow raw sewage to directly enter groundwater with minimal biological cleansing, leading to groundwater pollution and undrinkable water supplies. It is for this reason that deep water wells on the property must be drilled far from the cesspool. Most residential waste cesspools in use in the US today are rudimentary septic systems, consisting of a concrete-capped pit lined with concrete masonry units (cinder blocks) laid on their sides with perforated drain field piping (weeping tile) extending outward below the level of the intake connection. The concrete cover will often have a cleanout pipe extending above ground. Some are constructed with concrete walls on one or more sides. The waste cesspool is vulnerable to overloading or flooding by heavy rains or snow melt because it is not enclosed and sealed like conventional septic tank systems. It is also vulnerable to the entry of tree roots which can eventually cause the system to fail.  Regulations  Modern environmental regulations either discourage or ban the use of cesspools, and instead connections to municipal sewage systems or septic tanks are encouraged or required. In many countries, planning and development regulations for the protection of the watershed prevent home-owners who live close to rivers and environmentally sensitive areas from installing a septic system, requiring a holding tank instead. = United States = In some localities in the U.S., existing rural residential waste cesspools are \\"grandfathered\\" or allowed to continue operations until they no longer function. Once defunct, they must be disconnected and replaced by modern septic systems. In areas that have a higher than usual water table or fail a percolation test, an above-ground drain field waste disposal system may be installed instead. In the case of sale or transfer of residential property that uses an existing waste cesspool system, local laws may differ. Some counties or jurisdictions do not permit the sale of residential property that utilizes a waste cesspool. Other counties or villages may recognize the \\"grandfather clause\\" and allow the property sale or transfer with the cesspool. = Europe = In France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, cesspits are forbidden.  History  =United States= The typical American urbanite in the 1870s relied on the rural solution of individual well and outhouse (privy) or cesspools. Baltimore in the 1880s smelled \\"like a billion polecats\\" according to H. L. Mencken, and a Chicagoan said in his city \\"the stink is enough to knock you down.\\" Improvement was slow, and large cities of the East and South depended to the end of the century mainly on drainage through open gutters. Pollution of water supplies by sewage as well as dumping of industrial waste accounted in large measures for the public health records and staggering mortality rates of the period. = Europe = Cesspits were introduced to Europe in the 16th century, at a time when urban populations were growing at a faster rate than in the past. The added burden of waste volume began overloading urban street gutters, where chamber pots were emptied each day. There was no regulation of cesspit construction until the 18th century, when a need to address sanitation and safety concerns became apparent. Cesspits were cleaned out by tradesmen using shovels and horse-drawn wagons. Cesspools were cleaned only at night, to reduce the smell and annoyance to the public. The typical cesspit was cleaned out once every 8 to 10 years. Fermentation of the solid waste collecting in cesspits, however, resulted in dangerous infections and gases that sometimes asphyxiated cesspit cleaners. Cesspits began to be cleaned out more regularly, but strict regulations for cesspit construction and ventilation were not introduced until the 1800s. Before construction reforms were introduced in the early 19th century, liquid waste would seep away through the ground, leaving solid waste behind in the cesspit. While this made removal of solid waste easier, the seeping liquid waste often contaminated well water sources, creating public health problems. Municipal reforms required that cesspits be built of solid walls of stone and concrete. This kept liquid waste in the cesspit, forcing cesspits to be cleaned more frequently, on average two or three times per year. Liquid cesspit waste would be removed with pumps by cesspit cleaners, and then solid waste, valuable as fertilizer and for manufacturing ammonia, was removed. In 1846, French public hygienist Alphone Guérard estimated that 100 cesspits were cleaned in Paris every night, by 200–250 total cesspit cleaners in the city, and out of a total of 30,000 cesspits. The replacement of Paris' cesspit system was challenged for decades by officials not on public hygiene grounds, but on economic ones, based on the desire to conserve human waste as fertilizer rather than disposing of it in a modern sewer system. Paris' sewer system began modernizing in the 1880s, with the conversion of storm sewers for public sewage. Some cesspits were still in use in Paris into the 20th century.  Society and culture  = Accidents = In Suffolk County, New York, most households still use cesspools for waste drainage. Cesspool collapses have occurred in this area, for example on December 8, 2009. Two workers in a decommissioned cesspit were trapped, subsequently leading to a two-hour rescue mission. Since 1998, six cases of cesspools collapsing and sucking in human residents that were standing over them have been reported, injuring a total of seven people, killing one in 2001, one in 2007,L.I. Landscaper Dies After Falling Into Cesspool and one in 2010. On June 1, 2011, two teenagers, from the Suffolk County neighborhood of Farmingville, drowned after becoming overwhelmed by fumes and trapped in a backyard cesspool measuring 16-feet deep. The collapsing cesspools were mostly due to older cesspools built with brick or cinder block. These structures weakened over their lifespan leading to increased risk of collapse. Newer cesspools are cast concrete which dramatically decrease any risk of collapse. All new construction in areas without waste sewer systems use these new precast cesspools. In addition, cast concrete cesspools are used commonly in commercial construction for storm water collection. = Archaeology = Archaeologists often use the term cesspit (or cess pit) to refer to a pit dug to receive human waste. The word “cess” is sometimes used by archaeologists to refer to the contents found in cesspits, despite this not being etymologically correct.

It is Nicaragua's first and largest national park, and one of 78 protected areas of Nicaragua. The complex volcano is composed of a nested set of calderas and craters, the largest of which is Las Sierras shield volcano and caldera. Within this caldera lies a sub-vent, which is Masaya Volcano sensu stricto. The vent is a shield type composing of basaltic lavas and tephras and includes a summit crater. This hosts Masaya caldera, formed 2,500 years ago by an 8-km³ basaltic ignimbrite eruption. Inside this caldera a new basaltic complex has grown from eruptions mainly on a semi-circular set of vents that include the Masaya and Nindiri cones. The latter host the pit craters of Masaya, Santiago, Nindiri and San Pedro. Observations in the walls of the pit craters indicate that there have been several episodes of cone and pit crater formation. Masaya continually emits large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas (from the active Santiago crater) and volcanologists study this (amongst other signs) to better understand the behavior of the volcano and also evaluate the impact of acid rain and the potential for health problems. History Santiago crater. The floor of Masaya caldera is mainly covered by poorly vegetated ʻaʻā lava, indicating resurfacing within the past 1,000 or so years, but only two lava flows have erupted since the sixteenth century. The first, in 1670, was an overflow from the Nindiri crater, which at that time hosted a 1-km-wide lava lake. The other, in 1772, issued from a fissure on the flank of the Masaya cone. Since 1772, lava has appeared at the surface only in the Santiago pit crater (presently active and persistently degassing) and possibly within Nindiri crater in 1852. A lake occupies the far eastern end of the caldera. Although the recent activity of Masaya has largely been dominated by continuous degassing from an occasionally lava-filled pit crater, a number of discrete explosive events have occurred in the last 50 years. One such event occurred on November 22, 1999, which was recognised from satellite data. A hot spot appeared on satellite imagery, and there was a possible explosion. On April 23, 2001, the crater exploded and formed a new vent in the bottom of the crater. The explosion sent rocks with diameters up to 60 cm which travelled up to 500 m from the crater. Vehicles in the visitors area were damaged and one person was injured. On October 4, 2003, an eruption cloud was reported at Masaya. The plume rose to a height of ~4.6 km. In 2008, the mountain erupted spewing ash and steam. This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity. On March 4, 2020, tightrope daredevil, Nik Wallenda, walked on a steel cable over the caldera. National park Masaya Volcano In 1979, Masaya became Nicaragua's first national park, named Masaya Volcano National Park (Parque Nacional Volcan Masaya). The park has an area of 54 km² includes two volcanoes and five craters, as well as a range of elevations between 100 and 630 meters above sea level. In the park is a lava tube formed by lava flows; one can find bats and look inside and observe the glowing lava in the dark crater mouth of the volcano. Geologic setting Geological map. Pele's hair, Santiago Crater, Nindiri Volcano Masaya is one of 18 distinct volcanic centers that make up the Nicaraguan portion of the Central American Volcanic Belt (CAVF). Formed by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate, along the Mesoamerican trench, the CAVF runs from volcán Tacaná in Guatemala to Irazú in Costa Rica. In western Nicaragua, the CAVF bisects the Nicaraguan Depression from Cosigüina volcano in the northwest to Maderas volcano in Lago Nicaragua. The Interior highlands to the northeast make up the majority of Nicaragua. Western Nicaragua consists of 4 principal geological provinces paralleling the Mesoamerican trench: 1. Pre-Cretaceous to Cretaceous ophiolitic suite; 2. Tertiary basins; 3. Tertiary volcanics; and the 4. Active Quaternary volcanic range. An ophiolitic suite is found in the Nicoya Complex, which is made up of cherts, graywackes, tholeiitic pillow lavas and basaltic agglomerates. It is intruded by gabbroic, diabasic, and dioritic rocks. The Cretaceous-Tertiary basin is made up of five formations of mainly marine origin. The Rivas and Brito formations are uplifted to the southeast and are overlain in the northwest by a slightly tilted marine near- shore sequence, the El Fraile formation. This in turn passes north into the undeformed Tamarindo formation, a sequence of shallow marine, lacustrine and terrestrial sediments interspersed with ignimbrites. Northeast of the Nicaraguan Depression, the Coyol and Matagalpa formations, run from Honduras to Costa Rica and still show evidence of some volcanic centres, distinguishable as constructional landforms. Quaternary volcanic rocks are found mainly in the Nicaraguan Depression and form two major groups: the Marrabios and the Sierras formations. The Marrabios Cordillera starts in the northwest with Cosiguina volcano and continues to the southeast with San Cristobal, Casitas, La Pelona, Telica and Rota. The Hoyo, Monte Galan, Momotombo and Momotombito volcanoes are built upon ignimbrite deposits from the nearby Malpaisillo caldera. South- east of Lake Managua lie Chiltepe, the Nejapa alignment, Masaya, Apoyo and Mombacho which overlie the Sierras ignimbrites, erupted from the Sierras Caldera surrounding Masaya volcano. Further south in Lake Cocibolca (or Lake Nicaragua), Zapatera, Concepcion and Maderas volcanoes mark the end of Nicaraguan section of the CAVF.

It is high. The Mombacho Volcano Nature Reserve is one of 78 protected areas of Nicaragua. Mombacho is not an extinct volcano, but the last eruption occurred in 1570. There is no historical knowledge of earlier eruptions. The highest regions of the volcano are home to a cloud forest and dwarf forest, which contain flora and fauna endemic purely to the volcano. An increasingly popular tourist attraction, the volcano has views of Lake Nicaragua and the city of Granada. The volcano also has two hiking trails, a moderate one that circles the main crater, and another, more difficult trail (El Puma), which must be led by a guide. The more difficult trail is the only way to see some features such as the dwarf forest. The trail is almost completely 45° inclines and declines for about two miles.

While with the Phillies, Daulton was a three-time MLB All-Star and won the Silver Slugger Award. He won the 1997 World Series with the Marlins. Professional career =Early years = 1988 Philadelphia Phillies #10 Darren Daulton home jersey The Philadelphia Phillies selected Daulton in the 25th round of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft. On September 25, 1983, he made his major league debut for the Phillies. Daulton had three at bats for the Phillies in 1983. Through , he played sparingly, due chiefly to the presence of all-star catchers Ozzie Virgil Jr. and Lance Parrish. Daulton became the Phillies' full-time catcher in . Throughout his early career, his primary value to the team was as a defensive catcher — his cumulative batting average of .206, through the 1988 season, was barely above the Mendoza Line — and he never appeared in as many as 60 games, in any single season. Daulton's breakout season was , his first as his team's primary backstop; that year, he batted .268, with 57 runs batted in (RBI) — which, when coupled with his skills behind the plate, earned him a three-year contract worth $6.75 million. Daulton caught Terry Mulholland's no-hitter, on August 15, 1990. =1991–1993 seasons= Following a slump, in , that saw his batting average fall below .200, Daulton led the National League (NL) in RBIs, for 1992, with 109. He also finished in the top 10 in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS, home runs, walks, runs created, and extra base hits. Daulton earned his first All-star appearance, the NL Silver Slugger Award, and sixth place in NL MVP voting. Daulton was one of the catalysts of the NL pennant-winning 1993 Phillies. Although the Phillies lost the World Series, Daulton was again named an All-star, drove in more than 100 runs for the second consecutive season, and finished seventh in NL MVP voting. He once again finished in the league’s top 10 in on-base percentage, RBIs, walks, and extra base hits. Daulton also finished in the top 10 in times on base and intentional walks. =Injury problems= Knee injuries soon caught up with Daulton. In , he was hitting .300, with 15 home runs, and 56 RBIs, through 67 games, when he was injured. In , Daulton was named to his third all-star team; however, he played in only 98 games, and finished the year with just nine home runs. Daulton never caught another big league game after August 25, 1995. Daulton missed nearly the entire season due to injury; he played in only five games, all as an outfielder. In , he returned to the outfield in an attempt to keep his still- productive bat in the line-up, despite his chronic injuries. Daulton also played 42 games as a first baseman. =Trade to the Florida Marlins= On July 21, 1997, after 17 years with the Phillies organization, the club traded Daulton to the Florida Marlins for Billy McMillon. By that time, Daulton's knee injuries had escalated even further, limiting his usage to playing first base and pinch hitting. He ended the 1997 campaign with a .263 batting average, 14 home runs, 63 RBI, and 68 runs scored, in 395 at bats. Daulton batted 7-for-18 (.389) in the 1997 World Series, as the Marlins defeated the Cleveland Indians. Daulton announced his retirement, after the series. =Career statistics= In 14 MLB seasons, Daulton hit .245, with 137 home runs, 588 RBIs, and 511 runs scored, in 1,161 games played. Bill James ranked Daulton as the 25th-greatest major league catcher of all-time, in the 2001 edition of his Historical Baseball Abstract. On August 6, 2010, Daulton was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame. Post-playing career Daulton was arrested several times on vehicle-related charges. He was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in Pinellas County, Florida, in 1988, and his driver's license was suspended for a year after he refused to take a breathalyzer test. His license was also suspended in the late 1990s due to unpaid speeding tickets; he received at least five during that time period, including one for traveling over in a zone. While under his license suspension, he was involved in a single-vehicle accident on January 3, 2001, causing $20,000 worth of damage to his BMW sedan. He again refused to be tested, and was charged with DUI, driving with a suspended license, and failing to appear in court. Two years later, he was arrested again for driving with a suspended license and DUI, after again refusing to be tested for alcohol. He was also arrested for battery against his wife. He served two and a half months in jail and spent another two and a half months in drug rehabilitation. Daulton authored a book on occultism and numerology, titled If They Only Knew, published in 2007. In the book he discusses numerous aspects of occultism, referencing experts in the field, and his personal experience with the paranormal. From 2010 to 2016, during the Philadelphia Phillies season, Daulton hosted the radio show \\"Talking Baseball with Dutch\\" from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on sports radio station WPEN in Philadelphia. On July 1, 2013, Daulton underwent surgery for resection of two brain tumors related to glioblastoma at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. On February 23, 2015, Daulton announced that he was cancer-free. The cancer returned in early 2017, and Daulton died from brain cancer on August 6, 2017, aged 55. Publications * * William C.

The Bogoliubov transformation is an isomorphism of either the canonical commutation relation algebra or canonical anticommutation relation algebra. This induces an autoequivalence on the respective representations. The Bogoliubov transformation is often used to diagonalize Hamiltonians, which yields the stationary solutions of the corresponding Schrödinger equation. The Bogoliubov transformation is also important for understanding the Unruh effect, Hawking radiation, pairing effects in nuclear physics, and many other topics. The Bogoliubov transformation is often used to diagonalize Hamiltonians, with a corresponding transformation of the state function. Operator eigenvalues calculated with the diagonalized Hamiltonian on the transformed state function thus are the same as before.  Single bosonic mode example  Consider the canonical commutation relation for bosonic creation and annihilation operators in the harmonic basis :\\\\left [ \\\\hat{a}, \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger \\\\right ] = 1~. Define a new pair of operators :\\\\hat{b} = u \\\\hat{a} + v \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger :\\\\hat{b}^\\\\dagger = u^* \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger + v^* \\\\hat{a}~, for complex number u and v, where the latter is the Hermitian conjugate of the first. The Bogoliubov transformation is the canonical transformation mapping the operators \\\\hat{a} and \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger to \\\\hat{b} and \\\\hat{b}^\\\\dagger. To find the conditions on the constants u and v such that the transformation is canonical, the commutator is evaluated, viz. :\\\\left [ \\\\hat{b}, \\\\hat{b}^\\\\dagger \\\\right ] = \\\\left [ u \\\\hat{a} + v \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger , u^* \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger + v^* \\\\hat{a} \\\\right ] = \\\\cdots = \\\\left ( u^2 - v^2 \\\\right ) \\\\left [ \\\\hat{a}, \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger \\\\right ]. It is then evident that \\\\,u^2 - v^2 = 1 is the condition for which the transformation is canonical. Since the form of this condition is suggestive of the hyperbolic identity :\\\\cosh^2 x - \\\\sinh^2 x = 1, the constants and can be readily parametrized as :u = e^{i \\\\theta_1} \\\\cosh r :v = e^{i \\\\theta_2} \\\\sinh r ~ . This is interpreted as a linear symplectic transformation of the phase space. By comparing to the Bloch-Messiah decomposition, the two angles \\\\theta_1 and \\\\theta_2 correspond to the orthogonal symplectic transformations (i.e., rotations) and the squeezing factor r corresponds to the diagonal transformation. =Applications= The most prominent application is by Nikolai Bogoliubov himself in the context of superfluidity.N. N. Bogoliubov: On the theory of superfluidity, J. Phys. (USSR), 11, p. 23 (1947), (Izv. Akad. Nauk Ser. Fiz. 11, p. 77 (1947)). Other applications comprise Hamiltonians and excitations in the theory of antiferromagnetism.See e.g. the textbook by Charles Kittel: Quantum theory of solids, New York, Wiley 1987. When calculating quantum field theory in curved space-times the definition of the vacuum changes and a Bogoliubov transformation between these different vacua is possible. This is used in the derivation of Hawking radiation. Bogoliubov transforms are also used extensively in quantum optics, particularly when working with gaussian unitaries (such as beamsplitters, phase shifters, and squeezing operations).  Fermionic mode  For the anticommutation relations :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{a}, \\\\hat{a}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 0, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{a}, \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 1, the Bogoliubov transformation can only satisfy the first of these anticommutation relations when uv=0. Therefore, the only non-trivial possibility is u=0, v=1, corresponding to particle-antiparticle interchange (or particle-hole interchange in many-body systems). Thus, for a single particle, the transformation can only be implemented (1) for a Dirac fermion where particle and antiparticle are distinct or (as opposed to a Majorana fermion or chiral fermion) or (2) for multi-fermionic systems, in which there is more than one type of fermion. =Applications= The most prominent application is again by Nikolai Bogoliubov himself, this time for the BCS theory of superconductivity. The point where the necessity to perform a Bogoliubov transform becomes obvious is that in mean-field approximation the Hamiltonian of the system can be written in both cases as a sum of bilinear terms in the original creation and destruction operators, involving finite \\\\,\\\\langle a_i^+a_j^+\\\\rangle-terms, i.e. one must go beyond the usual Hartree–Fock method. In particular, in the mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian formalism with a superconducting pairing term such as \\\\Delta a_i^+a_j^+ + \\\\textrm{h.c.} , the Bogoliubov transformed operators b, b^{\\\\dagger} annihilate and create quasiparticles (each with well-defined energy, momentum and spin but in a quantum superposition of electron and hole state), and have coefficients u and v given by eigenvectors of the Bogoliubov- de Gennes matrix. Also in nuclear physics, this method is applicable since it may describe the \\"pairing energy\\" of nucleons in a heavy element.  Multimode example  The Hilbert space under consideration is equipped with these operators, and henceforth describes a higher-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (usually an infinite-dimensional one). The ground state of the corresponding Hamiltonian is annihilated by all the annihilation operators: :\\\\forall i \\\\qquad a_i 0\\\\rangle = 0 All excited states are obtained as linear combinations of the ground state excited by some creation operators: :\\\\prod_{k=1}^n a_{i_k}^\\\\dagger 0\\\\rangle One may redefine the creation and the annihilation operators by a linear redefinition: :a'_i = \\\\sum_j (u_{ij} a_j + v_{ij} a^\\\\dagger_j) where the coefficients \\\\,u_{ij},v_{ij} must satisfy certain rules to guarantee that the annihilation operators and the creation operators a^{\\\\prime\\\\dagger}_i, defined by the Hermitian conjugate equation, have the same commutators for bosons and anticommutators for fermions. The equation above defines the Bogoliubov transformation of the operators. The ground state annihilated by all a'_{i} is different from the original ground state 0\\\\rangle and they can be viewed as the Bogoliubov transformations of one another using the operator-state correspondence. They can also be defined as squeezed coherent states. BCS wave function is an example of squeezed coherent state of fermions.Svozil, K. (1990), \\"Squeezed Fermion states\\", Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 3341-3343.

Abdelaziz of Morocco (24 February 187810 June 1943;There is a dispute on the exact date of birth with two dates given: Feb 24, 1878 or Feb 18, 1881, while Chisholm (1911) states 1880. ), also known as Mulai Abd al-Aziz IV, succeeded his father Hassan I of Morocco as the Sultan of Morocco in 1894 at the age of sixteen. He was a member of the Alaouite dynasty. He tried to strengthen the central government by implementing a new tax on agriculture and livestock, a measure which was strongly opposed by sections of the society. This in turn led Abdelaziz to mortgage the customs revenues and to borrow heavily from the French, which was met with widespread revolt and a revolution that deposed him in 1908 in favor of his brother Abd al-Hafid. Accession to the throne Mulay Abdul Aziz, from a 1904 publication. By the action of Ba Ahmad bin Musa, the Chamberlain of Hassan I of Morocco, Abd al-Aziz's accession to the sultanate was ensured with little fighting. Ba Ahmad became regent and for six years showed himself a capable ruler. There were strong rumors that he was poisoned. On his death in 1900 the regency ended, and Abd al-Aziz took the reins of government into his own hands and chose an Arab from the south, Sid Mehdi el Menebhi, as his chief adviser. Rule Sultan Abdelaziz was the first Moroccan sultan to wear European clothing. As urged by his GeorgianFIGHT EXPECTED AT FEZ.; Rebels Only Four Hours from Capital at Last Report. LONDON TIMES -- NEW YORK TIMES Special Cablegram. January 2, 1903American Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events, Volume 19; Volume 34, D. Appleton, 1895, p.501 or Circassian mother, the sultan sought advice and counsel from Europe and endeavored to act on it, but advice not motivated by a conflict of interest was difficult to obtain, and in spite of the unquestionable desire of the young ruler to do what was best for the country, wild extravagance both in action and expenditure resulted, leaving the sultan with a depleted exchequer and the confidence of his people impaired. His intimacy with foreigners and his imitation of their ways were sufficient to rouse strong popular opposition. While privately owned printing presses had been allowed since 1872, Abdelaziz passed a dhahīr in 1897 that regulated what could be printed, allowing the qadi of Fes to establish a board to censor publications, and requiring that the judges be notified of any publication, so as to \\"avoid printing something that is not permitted.\\" According to Abdallah Laroui, these restrictions limited the volume and variety of Moroccan publications at the turn of the century, and institutions such as al-Qarawiyyin University and Sufi zawiyas became dependent on imported texts from Egypt. His attempt to reorganize the country's finances by the systematic levy of taxes was hailed with delight, but the government was not strong enough to carry the measures through, and the money which should have been used to pay the taxes was employed to purchase firearms instead. And so the benign intentions of Mulai Abd el-Aziz were interpreted as weakness, and Europeans were accused of having spoiled the sultan and of being desirous of spoiling the country. When British engineers were employed to survey the route for a railway between Meknes and Fez, this was reported as indicating the sale of the country outright. The strong opposition of the people was aroused, and a revolt broke out near the Algerian frontier. Such was the state of things when the news of the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904 came as a blow to Abd-el-Aziz, who had relied on England for support and protection against the inroads of France. See also the Ion Perdicaris affair. =Algeciras Conference= Sultan Abdelaziz in aristocratic regalia On the advice of Germany, Abdelaziz proposed an international conference at Algeciras in 1906 to consult upon methods of reform, the sultan's desire being to ensure a state of affairs which would leave foreigners with no excuse to interfere in the control of the country and thereby promote its welfare, which he had earnestly desired from his accession to power. This was not, however, the result achieved (see main article), and while on June 18 the sultan nonetheless ratified the resulting Act of the conference, which the country's delegates had found themselves unable to sign, the anarchic state into which Morocco fell during the latter half of 1906 and the beginning of 1907 revealed the young ruler as lacking sufficient strength to command the respect of his turbulent subjects. =Rebellions=  Bouhmara  Jilali Ben Idris al-Yusufi al-Zarhouni (Bouhmara) appeared in 1902 claiming to be Abdelaziz's older brother and the rightful heir to the throne. He had spent time in Fes and learned the politics of the Makhzen. The pretender to the throne established a rival makhzen, traded with Europe and collected duties, imported arms, granted Europeans mining rights in the Rif, and claimed to be the mahdi.  Raisuni  Ahmed er-Raisuni, a warlord with Alawite ancestry, started a gang near Tangier that would kidnap Christians, including Ion Perdicaris, Walter Burton Harris, and Harry Aubrey de Vere Maclean, and ransom them—in open defiance of the Makhzen of Abdelaziz.  Oujda  Émile Mauchamp, a French doctor, was assassinated by a mob in Marrakesh March 19, 1907. France took his death as a pretext to invade Oujda from Algeria on March 29.  Casablanca  In July 1907, tribesmen of the Chaouia—demanding removal of the French officers from the customs house, an immediate halt on the construction of the port, and the destruction of the railroad crossing over the Sidi Belyout cemetery—incited a riot in Casablanca, calling for holy war. European railroad workers were killed, leading to the port's bombardment and occupation by France. = Hafidiya = A few months earlier in May 1907, the southern aristocrats, led by the head of the Glaoua tribe Si Elmadani El Glaoui, invited Abdelhafid, an elder brother of Abdelaziz, and viceroy at Marrakech, to become sultan, and the following August Abdelhafid was proclaimed sovereign there with all the usual formalities. In September, Abd-el-Aziz arrived at Rabat from Fez and endeavored to secure the support of the European powers against his brother. From France he accepted the grand cordon of the Legion of Honour, and was later enabled to negotiate a loan. This was seen as leaning to Christianity and aroused further opposition to his rule, and in January 1908 he was declared deposed by the ulema of Fez, who offered the throne to Hafid. =End of rule= After months of inactivity Abdelaziz made an effort to restore his authority, and quitting Rabat in July he marched on Marrakech. His force, largely owing to treachery, was completely overthrown on August 19 when nearing that city, and Abdelaziz fled to Settat, within the French lines around Casablanca. In November he came to terms with his brother, and thereafter took up his residence in Tangier as a pensioner of the new sultan. However the exercise of Moroccan law and order continued to deteriorate under Abdelhafid, leading to the humiliating Treaty of Fez in 1912, in which European nations assumed many responsibilities for the sultanate, which was divided into three zones of influence. Exile and death Sultan Abdelaziz led a very active social but only semipolitical life in exile. During the Spanish annexation of Tangier in 1940, he acquiesced insofar as the Moroccan palace authorities called the \\"makhzen\\" played a significant role therein. Abdelaziz died in Tangier in 1943. His body was transported to Fez, where he was buried in the royal necropolis of the Moulay Abdallah Mosque. Legacy After the ex-sultan's sudden death in 1943, his body was transferred to French Morocco as desired by the Sultan Mohammed V. He was portrayed by Marc Zuber in the film The Wind and the Lion (1975), a fictional version of the Perdicaris affair.

A perfusionist or perfusiologist or clinical perfusion scientist, is a healthcare professional who operates the cardiopulmonary bypass machine (heart–lung machine) during cardiac surgery and other surgeries that require cardiopulmonary bypass to manage the patient's physiological status. As a member of the cardiovascular surgical team, the perfusionist helps maintain blood flow to the body's tissues as well as regulate levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood.  Duties  Perfusionists form part of the wider cardiovascular surgical team which includes cardiac surgeons, anesthesiologists, and residents. Their role is to conduct extracorporeal circulation as well as ensure the management of physiologic functions by monitoring the necessary variables. The perfusionist provides consultation to the physician in selecting appropriate equipment and techniques to be used. Other responsibilities include administering blood products, administering anesthetic agents or drugs, measuring selected laboratory values (such as blood cell count), monitoring circulation, monitoring blood gases, surveil anticoagulation, induction of hypothermia, and hemodilution. Sometimes, perfusionists are granted administrative tasks such as purchasing supplies or equipment, as well as personnel and departmental management. = Involved procedures = Perfusionists can be involved in a number of cardiac surgical procedures, select vascular procedures and a few other surgical procedures in an ancillary role. Perfusionists may participate in curative or staged palliative procedures to treat the following pediatric pathologies: * atrial septal defects, * ventricular septal defects, * tetralogy/pentalogy of Fallot, * truncus arteriosus, * transposition of the great vessels, * cardiac transplants, * lung transplants, * coarctation of the aorta, * interrupted aortic arch, * hypoplastic left/right heart, * subaortic membrane, * mitral valve repair/replacement, * aortic valve disorders, * anomalous/single coronary artery, * vascular ring, * extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) Adult surgical procedures may include: * coronary artery bypass, * aortic valve replacements, * mitral valve repair/mitral valve replacement * tricuspid valve repair * aortic root replacements * atrial myxomas * dissections/aneurysms/trauma of the aorta (ascending, arch & descending) * renal cell carcinoma/obstructive vena cava * veno-venous bypass (e.g. during liver transplants) * cardiac/lung transplants * implants of ventricular assist device and ECMO. Select ancillary procedures in which perfusion techniques and/or perfusionists may be involved include isolated limb perfusion, intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion and tracheal resection/repair. Training and certification =United States= In the United States, a four-year bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for admission into an accredited perfusion program, typically with a concentration in biology, chemistry, anatomy and physiology, varying depending on specific perfusion program. As of 2019, there are 17 accredited perfusion training programs, of which 9 are master's degrees, 6 are certificate programs, and 2 are bachelor's degrees. Training typically consists of two years of academic and clinical education. A perfusion student will typically begin his or her training in a didactic fashion in which the student will closely follow instructions from a certified clinical perfusionist in the confines of a cardiac surgery procedure. Academic coursework may be concurrent or precede this clinical instruction. Early in their clinical training, the perfusion student may have little involvement outside of an observational role. However, as time progresses, more tasks may be incrementally delegated to them. Upon graduating from a perfusion program, the graduate must begin the certification process. In the interim, the perfusion graduate is typically referred to as board-eligible, which is sufficient for employment in cardiac surgery with the understanding that achieving certified status is required for long-term employment. Most employers have stipulations on the duration of board-eligible status. To become certified as a certified clinical perfusionist, a perfusionist must undergo a two-part exam administered by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion. The first part is the Perfusion Basic Science Exam and the second part the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam. The exam process is open to a perfusion student that has graduated or about to graduate from an accredited perfusion education program. In addition, a perfusion student must have participated in a minimum of 75 perfusions during the course of their training before sitting for the Perfusion Basic Science Exam and performed 40 independent perfusions after graduation before sitting for the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam. Upon passing the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam, the perfusionist is designated a certified clinical perfusionist. Following certification, perfusionists must be recertified every year by attaining minimum clinical and educational requirements. Proof of fulfillment of these recertification requirements must be submitted to the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion and are mandatory to maintain certified status to use the designation. Perfusionist operating a modern heart–lung machine As of February 2010, there were 3,766 certified perfusionists in the United States and approximately 300 certified perfusionists in Canada. =Canada= In Canada, there are three training programs: Burnaby in Western Canada, Toronto and Montreal in Eastern Canada. British Columbia Institute of Technology in Burnaby offers an advanced specialty certificate in cardiovascular perfusion to graduates of its two-year program. Applicants must be certified respiratory therapists, critical care nurses, or cardiac professionals with two years or more of current experience in cardiac critical care. Applicants to the Michener Institute program in Toronto must have a bachelor's degree. The training program is 16 months to two years. The perfusion program of the Université de Montréal is a three-year bachelor's degree of 90 credits in biomedical science of which 27 credits are specific to clinical perfusion and in addition a diplôme d’études supérieurs spécialisées (DESS) of 30 credits in clinical perfusion of one-year at the master level. =United Kingdom and Ireland= In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a bachelor's degree in a science subject (usually life or clinical sciences) is a prerequisite to enrollment on the two-year perfusion training course. Employment as a trainee perfusionist is also required. Trainees must complete a two-year MSc program at the University of Bristol. They complete academic assessments (essays and exams), while in the workplace moving from a purely observational role to one in which they are capable of managing the patient while they are on cardiopulmonary system with minimal supervision. Once a trainee has been the primary perfusionist in 150 clinical procedures, they must undertake a practical exam. For this exam, the candidate is observed by two external examiners whilst building and priming a cardiopulmonary circuit, then using it during a surgical operation. After the practical exam, trainees must complete a 40-minute viva voce exam, which tests their academic knowledge. After this is successfully completed, they are awarded an MSc in Clinical Perfusion Science and the status of accredited clinical perfusion scientist. They must maintain this by performing a minimum of 40 clinical procedures per year. = Australia and New Zealand = In Australia and New Zealand, a perfusionist must have at least a science degree (usually in health sciences) as an entry requirement before training. Further didactic training is in a practical format at a hospital whilst doing a three-year course via correspondence and e-learning, with the Australian and New Zealand College of Perfusionists (ANZCP). The final examination for a clinical perfusionist is administered by the ANZCP over two days. This involves three hours of written assessment, two hours of multiple choice questions, and four half-hour viva voce. A separate profession is the medical perfusionist who is a physician who has undertaken additional subspecialty training. =India= In India, there are different programs for educating perfusionists. A three-year bachelor's degree program, a two-year post-graduate diploma and a three-and-half year bachelor's degree program (which includes a six-month internship) are available. Bachelor's and masters degree in some reputed institutions (i.e. PGI Chandigarh, AIIMS New Delhi, jipmer, naryana groups Bangalore, Sawai Mansingh Medical College Jaipur.) Recently, the Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion of India introduced certification. =Other countries= In China, Egypt, and some South American countries a clinical perfusionist is a medical doctor who has completed subspecialty training.

Facing the Palestinians are the British, with Sir Neville Chamberlain presiding. To his right is Lord Halifax, and to his left, Malcolm MacDonald. The Arab delegation refused to sit together with the Jewish delegation. Awni Abd al-Hadi, () (1889, Nablus, Ottoman Empire – 15 March 1970, Cairo, Egypt) was a Palestinian political figure. He was educated in Beirut, Istanbul, and at the Sorbonne University in Paris. His wife was Tarab Abd al-Hadi, a Palestinian activist and feminist. Political activity In 1911 Abd al-Hadi, along with Rafiq al-Tamimi were founding members of the Paris-based underground al-Fatat (\\"the Young Arab Society\\") nationalist society, which was devoted to Arab independence and unity. He was among the organizers of the Arab Congress of 1913 in Paris. When Faisal I of Iraq arrived in Paris en route to London in December 1918 Ahmad Qadri located Abd al-Hadi introduced him to Faisal who appointed him as the head of the administrative office for the Arab delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. Abd al-Hadi was later an adviser to Amir Abdullah in Transjordan. On his return to Palestine in 1924, Abd al-Hadi became one of the chief spokesmen of the Palestinian Arab nationalist movement and was elected representative to the 5th (August 1922, Nablus) and 6th (June 1923, Jaffa) Congress of the Arab Executive Committee for Jenin and to the 7th (June 1928) for Beisan. He was secretary of the Executive Committee's Congress in 1928. In 1930 Abd al-Hadi was a member of the Palestinian Arab delegation to the United Kingdom and a lawyer for the Supreme Muslim Council. In August, 1932 he was a founder, general secretary and first elected president of the Palestinian Istiqlal (Independence) Party, the first regularly constituted Palestinian Arab political party. He was also the party's representative on the Arab Higher Committee, formed in April 1936, for which he served as general secretary. Abd al-Hadi was a moderate who was prepared to negotiate with members of the Yishuv. He testified to the Peel Commission, \\"There is no such country [as Palestine].... Palestine is a term the Zionists invented.... Our country was for centuries part of Syria.\\" Abd al-Hadi held some responsibility for the Arab revolt of 1936–39. The Istiqlal Party was banned and he, who was out of the territory at the time, was banned from re-entry to Palestine. The British administration also deported three committee members and two other political leaders in 1937 (until 1941). He was a member of the Palestinian delegation to the London Conference in February 1939. After the 1948 Arab- Israeli war, Awni Abd al-Hadi ended up in Cairo, Egypt with his wife, Tarab Abdul Hadi. In 1948, Abd al-Hadi was a member and appointed Minister for Social Affairs of the Egyptian-sponsored All-Palestine Government headed by Amin al-Husayni. From 1951 to 1955, he was Jordan's minister and later ambassador to Cairo. From 1955 to 1958, he was a Jordanian senator and from 1958 chairman of the Arab League's Legal committee in Cairo.

His younger brother, Abdelaziz of Morocco, preceded him. While Mulai Abdelhafid initially opposed his brother for giving some concessions to foreign powers, he himself became increasingly backed by the French and finally signed the protectorate treaty giving de facto control of the country to France.  Hafidiya  After his brother Abdelaziz appointed him as caliph of Marrakesh, Abdelhafid sought to have him overthrown by fomenting distrust over Abdelaziz's European ties. Abdelhafid was aided by Madani al-Glaoui, older brother of T'hami, one of the Caids of the Atlas. He was assisted in the training of his troops by Andrew Belton (Kaid), a British officer and veteran of the Second Boer War.New York Times, November 4, 1908 For a brief period, Abdelaziz reigned from Rabat while Abdelhafid reigned in Marrakesh and Fes. In 1908 Abdelaziz was defeated in battle. In 1909, Abdelhafid became the recognized leader of Morocco.

This led to the Agadir Crisis, also known as the Second Moroccan Crisis. These events led Abdelhafid to abdicate after signing the Treaty of Fes on 30 March 1912,W.

In 1910, Lalla Batoul, a Fesi aristocrat and the wife of a former governor of Fes and supporter of Abdelaziz, was tortured. She was chained to the wall in a crucifixion position, completely naked with her breasts seized in a vice, and whipped and interrogated about the whereabouts of her husband's fortune under the direct supervision of Abdelhafid. Walter Burton Harris reported on the incident in an article published in the Times of Morocco.  Death  Abd al-Hafid died in Enghien-les-Bains, France, on April 4, 1937.

By contrast, ice masses of similar size that are constrained by topographical features are known as ice fields. The dome of an ice cap is usually centred on the highest point of a massif. Ice flows away from this high point (the ice divide) towards the ice cap's periphery. Ice caps have significant effects on the geomorphology of the area that they occupy. Plastic moulding, gouging and other glacial erosional features become present upon the glacier's retreat. Many lakes, such as the Great Lakes in North America, as well as numerous valleys have been formed by glacial action over hundreds of thousands of years. On Earth, there are about of total ice mass.

Lalique is best known for producing glass art, including perfume bottles, vases, and hood ornaments during the early twentieth century. Following the death of René, Lalique transitioned to producing lead glass (crystal) works during the 1950s while under the direction of René's son, Marc Lalique. Since 2010, Lalique has been owned by Swiss company Art and Fragrance. History René Lalique (1860-1945) began his career as a jewellery apprentice at the age of 16, and by 1881 he was a freelance designer for many of the best-known Parisian jewellers. In 1885, he opened his own workshop on Place Gaillon in Paris, the former workshop of Jules Destape. In 1887, Lalique opened a business on Rue du Quatre-Septembre, and registered the \\"RL\\" mark the following year. In 1890, he opened a shop in the Opera District of Paris. Within a decade, Lalique was amongst the best-known Parisian jewellers. Oiseau de Feu (Firebird), 1922 In 1905, Lalique opened a new shop at Place Vendôme which exhibited not only jewellery, but glass works as well. It was close to the shop of renowned perfumer François Coty; in 1907, Lalique began producing ornate perfume bottles for Coty. The production of glass objects began at his country villa in 1902, and continued there until at least 1912. The first Lalique glassworks opened in 1909 in a rented facility in Combs-la-Ville, which Lalique later purchased in 1913. In December 1912, Lalique hosted an exhibition of Lalique Glass—as his glass would come to be known—at the Place Vendôme shop. During the First World War, the glassworks produced mundane items in support of the war effort. In 1919, work began on a new production facility in Wingen-sur-Moder, which opened in 1921. From 1925-1931, Lalique produced 29 models of hood ornaments; a mermaid statuette first produced in 1920 was also later sold as a hood ornament. During the 1920s and 1930s, Lalique was amongst the world's most renowned glassmakers. René Lalique died in 1945. His son Marc Lalique took over the business, operating initially as \\"M.Lalique\\" and later as \\"Cristal Lalique\\". Under Marc's leadership, the company transitioned from producing its famous Lalique Glass to producing lead glass, commonly known as crystal. Marie-Claude Lalique took control of the company following Marc's death in 1977. It was sold to Pochet in 1994 and to a partnership of Art & Fragrance and the holding company Financière Saint-Germain in 2008. Since 2010, Cristal Lalique has been wholly owned by Art & Fragrance. Works Sirene (statuette/hood ornament), 1920 Today, Lalique produces an array of luxury products in five main categories: jewellery, decorative items, interior design, perfumes, and art. The company is best known for the production of artistic glass works, primarily using crystal (lead glass) since the mid-twentieth century. The addition of perfumes (in 1992) and non-glass decorative items and art (since 2011) are recent additions to Lalique's product line. Reproductions of designs by René Lalique have increased since 2009. From its founding until the 1900s-1910s, Lalique was one of France's foremost Art Nouveau jewellery designers. In the first two decades of the twentieth century, Lalique transitioned into one of the world's most renowned makers of artistic glass objects. During the first half of the twentieth century, Lalique produced perfume bottles, vases (about 300 designs), hood ornaments (30 designs), and decorative glass works, such as inkwells, bookends, and paperweights. Lalique also designed several interiors, incorporating copious amounts of glass, including interiors for: the SS Paris, the SS Ile de France, the SS Normandie, Orient Express railroad cars, Peace Hotel (Shanghai), Oviatt Building (Los Angeles), and St Matthew's Church (Jersey). Factory The company's sole production facility is the Cristallerie Lalique in Wingen-sur-Moder. It was opened in 1921 as the Verrerie d'Alsace (Alsace Glassworks) and given its present name in 1962.

A door knocker has a part fixed to the door, and a part (usually metal) which is attached to the door by a hinge, and may be lifted and used to strike a plate fitted to the door, or the door itself, making a noise. The struck plate, if present, would be supplied and fitted with the knocker. Door knockers are often ornate, but may be no more than a simple fitting with a metal bob, or ring. German professor Franz Sales Meyer distinguished three kinds of door knocker: the \\"ring\\", the \\"hammer\\", and an ornate category which could take the shape of an animal or another figure.

The purpose of OTL is to set a limit on crews so that marshals and other personnel involved in running a rally only need to wait a fixed amount of time after the last car was due before closing the control. Without OTL it could be very difficult to run a rally smoothly without having huge numbers of volunteers willing to wait around indefinitely. For crews in a stage rally, OTL is a fixed limit of accrued lateness, after which one is no longer allowed to continue to compete. Lateness itself is not necessarily the result of a lack of competitiveness - for example a 10-minute roadside repair on a non-competitive section would not count against that crew's recorded stage times, etc., but it would count towards lateness. Many rallies feature special controls and breaks which allow any accrued lateness to be reset. In certain rallies (mainly road and navigational) it is also possible to make back lateness during the normal course of the event, subject to certain restrictions. Also any lateness incurred due to a decision of the organisers or force majure (i.e. an alteration of the route or hold-up) is not counted against the total lateness. In a navigational rally or road rally then any crew which turns up at a time control OTL is deemed not to have visited it at all and penalised accordingly: either excluded if the control is a main time control; or typically 30 minutes or 1 fail for other controls. The official expansion of the term OTL is \\"Over Total Lateness\\", although in everyday use only \\"Over Time Limit\\" is generally used. In Australian rallying, the term \\"Out of Late Time\\" (OLT) is used. Whilst not a term used in the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport's Manual of Motor Sport (neither is Over Time Limit), it is a term used commonly on Australian rallying websites in event reports and also in event results.

It is located on the Great Western Highway between Hazelbrook in the north east and Bullaburra in the west. Lawson has a station on the Main Western line. The town is also served by a public swimming pool and over the years has developed into the commercial hub of the mid-mountains area, which spans from Linden to Bullaburra, boasting a significant industrialised area as well as a shopping centre located on the south-eastern side of the highway.  History  One of the first settlements on the eastern slopes of the Blue Mountains, Lawson was identified on early maps as 24 Mile Hollow-a name which was changed to Christmas Swamp for a few years. When the Blue Mountain Inn was opened in 1848, the locals adopted the name Blue Mountain for the village. This name was also given to the original railway station after the rail line was pushed through in 1867. The presence of a Blue Mountain on the Blue Mountains, however, became so confusing to visitors that the authorities stepped in and renamed the village Lawson in honour of William Lawson who, along with William Wentworth and Gregory Blaxland, were the first Europeans to cross the Blue Mountains in 1813.\\"Origin of Blue Mountains Town Names\\" Blue Mountains City Council In 1931, the Railway Department agreed to supply electricity to the Blue Mountains Shire Council. Power lines were constructed between Blackheath and Lawson, accompanied by a maintenance track. The authorities then decided to promote the maintenance track as a walking trail; it became known as Bruce's Walk, after the surveyor who planned it.How to See the Blue Mountains, Jim Smith (Second Back Row Press), 1986, pp.64-66 The track later became neglected and forgotten, until it was rediscovered and improved by bushwalkers in the 1980s. It can now be followed from Medlow Bath to the north side of Lawson, although it is not shown on the relevant topographic map. In more recent years, Lawson was at the centre of controversy due to an ongoing government proposal to widen the Great Western Highway. The highway was a single lane in each direction through the town; the proposed plan by the Roads and Traffic Authority for widening necessitated the removal and relocation of the existing shops and the demolition of the Lawson Community Centre, formerly known as the Mechanics' Institute Hall, which dated back to 1903. Groups opposed to the demolition claimed the hall could be re-sited; others claimed this would be too costly, that the building was in poor repair and contained dangerous levels of asbestos. There was also a group lobbying for the retention of the shops on heritage grounds. By the end of 2008, the Community Centre had been saved.Mid Mountains History:Retrieved 1st January 2009  Heritage listings  Lawson has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks * Main Western railway: Lawson railway station *Honour Avenue.  Population  According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 2,614 people in Lawson. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.2% of the population. * 77.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 6.3%. * 89.9% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.2%, Catholic 18.7% and Anglican 14.1%.  Attractions  The walks in South Lawson can be accessed from several points along Honour Ave, within easy walk of the train station. This includes four waterfalls: Adelina Falls, Cataract Falls, Federal Falls and Junction Falls. While not having the height of upper mountains waterfalls, this waterfalls walk can be completed in 2 hours. On the north side of town beyond the swimming centre, walks take in Fairy Falls, Dante's Glen, St Michael's Falls, and Echo Bluff (sometimes referred to as Echo point). Community activities include: Magpie Markets at Lawson Public School are held on the third Sunday on most months (2nd Sunday December, no market in January) In November, the \\"Love Lawson Festival\\", later changed to the Mid Mountains Festival is held in conjunction with the Magpie Markets celebrating what is good about living in Lawson and the mid mountains. The historic Lawson Community Hall (Mechanics Institute) built in 1903 has now reopened after a long battle to save it from demolition due to road widening, and is now the location of numerous community activities.

In its modern form it consisted of a series of \\"steps\\" that are called out by the MC. Each step was relatively simple and easy to execute; however, the challenge was to keep up with the speed of each step. The phrase \\"Hully Gully\\" or \\"Hull da Gull\\" comes from a folk game in which a player shakes a handful of nuts or seeds and asks his opponent \\"Hully Gully, how many?\\" \\"Hully Gully\\" is also a phrase in the pro-wrestling world as the predicament a wrestler finds himself in when hanging between the ring ropes or possibly tangled within said ropes. Made famous by the legendary Dusty Rhodes. Modern form The Hully Gully was started by Frank Rocco at the Cadillac Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1959 The Olympics sang the song \\"Hully Gully\\", which involved no physical contact at all. In 1961 the Olympics version of the song was popularized in the south of England by the first version of Zoot Money's Big Roll Band and involved the audience facing the stage in lines and dancing the steps of the \\"Southampton jive\\". The same tune appeared in 1961 in a song by the Marathons, entitled \\"Peanut Butter\\", which was later used for the Peter Pan Peanut Butter commercial during the 1980s. Tim Morgan sang different lyrics to the song \\"Peanut Butter\\" as well, however, only mentioning the Skippy\\" brand. There was another song about the dance by the Dovells, entitled \\"Hully Gully Baby\\". The Jive Five had a hit called \\"Hully Gully Callin' Time\\"; Ike & Tina Turner had a song in their repertoire known as \\"If You Can Hully Gully (I Can Hully Gully Too)\\". Ed Sullivan mentioned the Cadillac Hotel as \\"Home of the Hully Gully\\" on his weekly show, featuring some dancers from Frank Rocco's revue. Known as \\"Mr. Hully Gully\\", Rocco then toured America (including the 1964 New York World's Fair—he danced it with Goldie Hawn) and Europe, where over the next year he taught the dance at the NATO Base in Naples, Italy, in Rome, and all over Europe. In popular culture * An example of the Hully Gully can be seen performed by John Belushi in the film The Blues Brothers. *In The Wanderers by Richard Price, the Hully Gully is enacted. * Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs' 1965 hit \\"Wooly Bully\\" was originally called \\"Hully Gully\\", but the band could not record it under that name due to the prior existence of a recorded song with that title.http://www.classicbands.com/samsham.html classicbands.com In addition, the speed of the beats did not fit the steps of the Hully Gully. * The Portuguese band Conjunto Académico João Paulo had a 1965 hit with the song Hully Gully do Montanhês (English: Mountain Man's Hully Gully) * In a 1993 episode of the TV series The Simpsons, Gabbo, a ventriloquist's dummy, dances wildly while singing, \\"I can do the Hully Gully!\\" In a 1990 episode of Roseanne called \\"PMS, I love you\\" it was described by Darlene as a dance that no child should have to witness their parents doing.

Since protonium is a bound system of a particle and its corresponding antiparticle, it is an example of a type of exotic atom called an onium. Protonium has a mean lifetime of approximately 1.0 μs and a binding energy of −0.75 keV. Like all onia, protonium is a boson with all quantum numbers (baryon number, flavour quantum numbers, etc.) and electrical charge equal to 0. Production There are two known methods to generate protonium. One method involves violent particle collisions. The other method involves putting antiprotons and protons into the same magnetic cage. The latter method was first used during the experiment ATHENA (ApparaTus for High precision Experiment on Neutral Antimatter) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva in 2002, but it was not until 2006 that scientists realized protonium was also generated during the experiment. Reactions involving a proton and an antiproton at high energies give rise to many-particle final states. In fact, such reactions are the basis of particle colliders such as the Tevatron at Fermilab. Indirect searches for protonium at LEAR (Low Energy Antiproton Ring at CERN) have used antiprotons impinging on nuclei such as helium, with unclear results. Very low energy collisions in the range of 10 eV to 1 keV may lead to the formation of protonium. Studies Planned experiments will use traps as the source of low energy antiprotons. Such a beam would be allowed to impinge on atomic hydrogen targets, in the field of a laser, which is meant to excite the bound proton–antiproton pairs into an excited state of protonium with some efficiency (whose computation is an open theoretical problem). Unbound particles are rejected by bending them in a magnetic field. Since the protonium is uncharged, it will not be deflected by such a field. This undeflected protonium, if formed, would be allowed to traverse a meter of high vacuum, within which it is expected to decay via annihilation of the proton and antiproton. The decay products would give unmistakable signatures of the formation of protonium. Theoretical studies of protonium have mainly used non- relativistic quantum mechanics. These give predictions for the binding energy and lifetime of the states. Computed lifetimes are in the range of 0.1 to 10 microseconds. Unlike the hydrogen atom, in which the dominant interactions are due to the Coulomb attraction of the electron and the proton, the constituents of protonium interact predominantly through the strong interaction. Thus multiparticle interactions involving mesons in intermediate states may be important. Hence the production and study of protonium would be of interest also for the understanding of internucleon forces.

Biography On 21 December 1676, a warrant was passed for \\"a grant to Charles Beauclerc, the King's natural son, and to the heirs male of his body, of the dignities of Baron of Heddington, co. Oxford, and Earl of Burford in the same county, with remainder to his brother, James Beauclerc, and the heirs male of his body.\\" A few weeks later, James was given \\"the title of Lord Beauclerc, with the place and precedence of the eldest son of an earl.\\" Just after the death of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, at the turn of the year, on 5 January 1684, King Charles granted his son Charles, Earl of Burford, the title of Duke of St Albans, gave him an allowance of £1,000 a year, and granted him the offices of Chief Ranger of Enfield Chace and Master of the Hawks in reversion (i. e. after the death of the current incumbents). He became colonel in the 8th regiment of horse in 1687, and served with the emperor Leopold I, being present at the siege of Belgrade in 1688. When his mother died (14 November 1687), Beauclerk received a large estate, including Burford House, near Windsor Castle. After the Battle of Landen in 1693, William III made Beauclerk captain of the gentlemen pensioners, and four years later gentleman of the bedchamber. His father had given him the reversion of the office of Hereditary Master Falconer and that of Hereditary Registrar of the Court of Chancery, which fell vacant in 1698. His Whig sentiments prevented his advancement under Queen Anne, but he was restored to favour at the accession of King George I. In 1718, George made him a Knight of the Garter. Beauclerk died at Bath two days after his 56th birthday and is buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his eldest son. Marriage and issue Arms of de Vere: Quarterly gules and or, in the first quarter a mullet argent, quartered by the 2nd Duke and his successors On 17 April 1694 he married Lady Diana de Vere, daughter and sole heiressHer other sisters died unmarried of Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford. She was a well-known beauty, who became lady of the bedchamber to Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales. By his wife he had twelve children: =Sons= *Charles Beauclerk, 2nd Duke of St Albans (6 April 169627 July 1751), eldest son and heir; *Lord William Beauclerk (22 May 169823 February 1733 N.S.) *Admiral Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere (14 July 169921 October 1781) *Colonel Lord Henry Beauclerk (11 August 17015 January 1761) *Lord Sidney Beauclerk (27 February 170323 November 1744) *Lieutenant-General Lord George Beauclerk (26 December 170411 May 1768) *Lord Seymour Beauclerk (born 24 June 1708c. 1709) *Rev.

The first is that on arrival of the King, his mother said, \\"Come here, you little bastard, and greet your father.\\" When the king rebuked her for calling him that, she replied, \\"Your Majesty has given me no other name to call him by.\\" In response, Charles created him Earl of Burford. Another legend is that Beauclerk's mother held him out of a window (or above a river) and threatened to drop him unless he was given a peerage. Charles supposedly cried out \\"God save the Earl of Burford!\\" and subsequently created that peerage.

It effectively incorporates a rule from the game shogi, in which a player can introduce a captured piece back to the chessboard as their own.  Rules  All the rules and conventions of standard chess apply, with the addition of drops, as explained below. * A captured piece reverses color and goes to the capturing player's reserve or pocket. At any time, instead of making a move with a piece on the board, a player can drop a piece from their reserve (a piece in there is considered “held” or “in hand”) onto an empty square on the board. For example, a check that would result in checkmate in standard chess can be answered in Crazyhouse, if the defender can play a legal drop that blocks the check. * Drops resulting in immediate checkmate are permitted. Unlike in shogi, this includes pawn drops. * Pawns may not be dropped on the players' 1st or 8th . * Pawns that have been promoted and later captured are dropped as pawns. * Dropped white and black pawns on the 2nd and 7th ranks, respectively, are permitted to make a two-square move as their first move after the drop.This isn't written in any rulebook, but Lichess and Chess.com allowed it. * A dropped rook can not castle.Also this isn't written in rule. Unlike shogi, having two or more pawns on a file, and checkmating with a dropped pawn, are both permissible. The physical problem of changing the color of a captured piece can be handled by:https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/crazyhouse.html *Swapping the piece for a piece of the same denomination and the other color taken from a second chess set. *Playing the game through a computer interface. *Having 32 white checkers with the drawing of the piece on it, and the orientation determines whose it is (like shogi) *Using a checker under the piece to mark its true color.  Notation  An extension to the standard chess notation is used to record drops. Drops are notated by the piece type, followed by an @ symbol, then the destination square. For example, N@d5 means \\"knight is dropped on d5 from reserve\\".  FEN  There is no standard FEN specification for Crazyhouse. However at Lichess an extended version of FEN is in use. Here is Lichess's FEN implemention example. r2qk3/pp2bqR1/2p5/8/3Pn3/3BPpB1/PPPp1PPP/RK1R4/PNNNbpp b - - 89 45 Lichess simply adds a 0th rank as a reserve. There are more than 8 pieces on the reserve, so the last section may have more than 8 characters. A different notation is used by Xboard/Winboard. The reserve is given in square brackets following the board position. r2qk3/pp2bqR1/2p5/8/3Pn3/3BPpB1/PPPp1PPP/RK1R4[PNNNbpp] b - - 89 45 Chess.com uses another notation. The reserve is put after full-move number. To keep track of which pieces currently on the board are actually promoted pawns, Lichess and Xboard/Winboard use \\"~\\" after letter designation. However, Chess.com uses coordinates of promoted pawn to resolve it. r2q1r1k/2p1ppb1/p2p2pp/3P1p2/B6B/2N2NPp/1PP2P1K/3Q3q w - - 0 26 NNBRpr h1  Variations  Minor variations of the rules have resulted in some variants. * Loop Chess: promoted pawns keep their rank when captured. * Chessgi (also known as Mad Mate or Neo Chess): promoted pawns keep their rank when captured.

They were first used as fishing boats, to be launched through the surf, sailed to the fishing grounds and then retrieved through the surf. There were two distinct versions, along the Northern Jersey Shore, The Sea Bright, and the Southern Shore, Jersey Skiff. In the early 20th century Jersey Skiffs were employed by early coast guardsmen and lifeguards. The boats had evolved into wreckage and salvage work as well as fishing uses. The primary difference between the two boats is the addition of a board on the side of the Jersey Skiff for slightly greater freeboard. Also the hull is slightly narrower for better rowing. And the transom of Jersey Skiff is more of a wine glass shape which integrates into the skeg, whereas The Sea Bright transom does not. The skeg can be added as an additional board. The design characteristics of the boat, are a stem that is slightly raked, less than a Dory and more than a Whitehall Rowboat. The stern was in a heart or wine glass shape with a rake toward the center of the boat. This allows the boat to be retrieved through the surf bow first. Although it is reported that in rougher conditions the boat is beached stern first. The boats are of fairly shallow draft and have a narrow flat bottom which is useful for sitting on the beach. Although the sides are generally rounded, without a keel but with a small skeg for tracking. The boats were generally outfitted with a sprit or lug sailing rig and a small jib. The mast was generally unstayed. Early fisherman used an oar to steer with rather than bring a separate rudder. Modern sailing versions come with a separate rudder. But an oarlock can be mounted on the transom for use with an oar as a steering device. Prohibition The boat during prohibition was modified into a speedboat but there are still some builders making traditional boats in fiberglass. With the start of Prohibition Captain William McCoy began to bring rum from Bimini and the Bahamas into south Florida through Government Cut. The Coast Guard soon caught up with him, so they began to bring the illegal goods to just outside the U.S. territorial waters and let smaller boats and other captains such as Habana Joe take the risk of bringing it into shore. By far the biggest Rum Row was in the New York/Philadelphia area off the New Jersey coast, where as many as 60 ships were seen at one time. One of the most notable New Jersey rum runners was Habana Joe, who could be seen at night running into remote areas in Raritan Bay with his flat-bottom skiff for running up on the beach, making his delivery, and speeding away.

History NC State Fair A Ferris wheel at the 2009 fair Fireworks at the 2009 fair The North Carolina State Fair was first held by the North Carolina State Agricultural Society at a site east of Raleigh in 1853. The event has been held at three different locations since, finding its current home in 1928. It has been celebrated continuously since 1853, with the exceptions of 1861 to 1869 (during the Civil War and Reconstruction), 1926 to 1927 (when the Agricultural Society disbanded and the state Agriculture Department took over operations), 1942 to 1945 (during World War II) and 2020 (see details below). In the 1870s and 1880s, the mills in Winston-Salem would close so that workers could attend the state fair in Raleigh. The fair has been held at its present site on the western edge of Raleigh since 1928. The 344 acre site includes many notable buildings, including Dorton Arena, a 7,500-seat arena constructed with a unique large suspended roof. Held for 11 days in mid-October, the fair attracts more than a million people to the N.C. State Fairgrounds in Raleigh. In 2010, the fair broke an attendance record with 1,091,887. Along with Dorton Arena, the North Carolina State Fair Commercial & Education Buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The pair of large rectangular exhibition halls were built in 1928, and are stucco-covered Mediterranean Revival style buildings. The buildings appear as a single building because of their unified facade and design, but are a large rectangular complex of two buildings, 504 feet in length and 80 feet in depth. They feature twin, tower-flanked entrances and glazed terra cotta ornamentation. On July 29, 2020, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the 2020 North Carolina State Fair would be cancelled. =Accidents and incidents= On October 24, 2013 five people (between the ages of 14 and 39 years old) were injured on the \\"Vortex\\" ride when the ride started up again as people were attempting to get off the ride. All were taken to WakeMed hospital in Raleigh. On October 29, 2013 the operator of the ride, Timothy Dwayne Tutterow, was charged with three felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, for inflicting serious bodily injury in connection with the accident. In June 2015, Tutterow pleaded guilty, but has not been sentenced as part of a plea arrangement to testify against the ride owner, Joshua Gene Macaroni. On February 19, 2016, Macaroni was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Exhibits =Antique Farm Machinery= The Antique Farm Machinery exhibit, located near the Village of Yesteryear displays a collection of vintage farm tools including traditional spinning wheels, horse-pulled tobacco and cotton pickers and planters, and aged hand reapers. The exhibit also features an old milk bottle display, and Model-T engine and more than a dozen Allis-Chalmers, Farmall, John Deere and Silver King tractors from the 1930s through the 1950s. =Cultivate a Career Tent= This exhibit replaced the Green NC exhibit during its debut in 2011. In the exhibit, visitors can go on a fun and interactive career personality scavenger hunt to learn about the wide variety of career paths in the agricultural industry. =Field of Dreams= This exhibit takes children through the growing and harvesting process, going from farm to table. Visitors to Field of Dreams can get a basket at the exhibit entrance and pick crops such as apples, strawberries and cucumbers. Along the way, they learn about other crops and how they turn into everyday staples, such as peanut butter and cereal. After picking the crops, children can then \\"sell\\" their harvest at the Field of Dreams Farmers Market for fair money. The money can then be spent at the Field of Dreams Grocery Store. Flower and Garden Show This oasis on the fairgrounds features winding pathways through beautiful gardens grown by local organizations. More than 90 demonstrations are held throughout the fair, with experts offering advice on such topics as pumpkin carving, flower arranging and proper plant care. =Got to Be NC Agriculture Tent= If you want the best, it's \\"Got to Be NC.\\" In this exhibit, visitors can discover and sample food products from across North Carolina. More than 20 local vendors participate in the exhibit throughout the course of the fair. =Heritage Circle= Heritage Circle is a step back in time. There is plenty of activity at the circle, from the crew maintaining the tobacco barn during the fair to the craftsmen demonstrating their traditional methods of woodcarving, blacksmithing and chair-building. Visitors can also enjoy the taste of homemade ice cream, apple cider or a hush puppy from the Old Grist Mill as they listen to engaging stories or the sweet melodies from the Bluegrass Stage. =State Fair Art= Fairgoers can see cattle, sheep, goats, swine and learn more about the various breeds of farm animals raised in North Carolina. More than 60 animals are on display, including the grand and reserve champions from the junior market steer, lamb, goat, turkey and barrow shows. =Village of Yesteryear= One of the N.C. State Fair's most popular and enduring attractions, the Village of Yesteryear features more than 75 artists and crafters creating, displaying and selling time-honored handmade crafts. Village crafters spin wool into yarn, weave yarn into cloth, make rugs, turn pottery, carve wooden bowls and utensils, make split-oak baskets and more. Native American crafts such as hand-coiled pottery, beadwork and stone carving are also featured. Kids and kids-at-heart can even make their own dolls or stuffed toy to take home. Competitions =General Exhibits= Division I competitions cover a variety of general topics including wine, cheese and butter, agronomy, forage crops, flower show, horticulture, arts and photography, and bees and honey. =Livestock= Division II premium book competitions cover all livestock categories, except for poultry and rabbits. The categories are dairy cattle, beef cattle, special shows, swine, meat sheep, dairy goats, pygmy goats, wool sheep and meat goats. =Poultry & Rabbits= Division III competitions cover poultry and domestic rabbit competitions. The winners of the rabbit competitions are on display in the Rabbit Barn during the State Fair. =Family & Consumer Sciences= Division IV categories include family and consumer sciences, such as culinary, specialty cooking contest, clothing and home furnishings. The division also houses all the 4-H competitions. =Special Exhibits= Division V competitions are made up of special exhibits on the fair. These include the Folk Festival, Department of Labor apprentice contest, horseshoe pitching contest, handicrafts and hobbies, and the essay contest. Folk Festival The Folk Festival was first held at the N.C. State Fair in 1948 to showcase North Carolina's traditional music and dance. More than 1,500 people participate each year for the coveted Bascom Lamar Lunsford Trophy. The trophy was named after the festival founder. =Horses= In addition to the N.C. State Fair, the fairgrounds is also host for the N.C. State Fair Horse Show and Hunter Jumper Show, which runs before, during and after the N.C. State Fair. The competition features thousands of horses and is open to the public. Entertainment North Carolina State Fair =Concerts in Dorton Arena= Each night, Dorton Arena lights up with performances from up-and-coming and legendary musical artists. The concerts span all music genres, including country, rock, R&B;, and contemporary Christian. Dorton Arena has hosted countless performers over the years, including The Platters, Garth Brooks, Ricky Nelson, Patty Loveless, Clint Black, Travis Tritt, Chubby Checker, Alan Jackson, Emmylou Harris, Trisha Yearwood, Waylon Jennings, The Temptations, KISS, The Four Tops, Three Dog Night, George Jones, Trace Adkins, Toby Keith, Little Richard, Ray Charles, Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Brad Paisley, Loretta Lynn, Village People, Josh Turner, Rascal Flatts, Clay Aiken, Edwin McCain, Third Day, Blake Shelton, Earl Scruggs, Clay Walker, Brandy Clark, Vanilla Ice, Chris Brown, Casting Crowns, Lady Antebellum, Jason Aldean, Kellie Pickler, Darius Rucker, Newsboys, Bruce Springsteen, The Everly Brothers, the Duke Ellington Orchestra,and Scotty McCreery. =Fireworks= Fireworks are shot off nightly at 9:45 p.m. For years, the fireworks were shot off from the lake across from Gate 8. In 2011, the fireworks were shot off from a new location across the street from the fairgrounds. The new location offers additional safety, frees traffic congestion and offers a spectacular panoramic view above the Midway. =Free Entertainment= The N.C. State Fair offers plenty of free entertainment for the price of admission ticket. There are roaming ground entertainers across the fairgrounds, staged entertainment acts in Kiddieland Fun Park and outside the Expo Center, as well as continuous musical performances on the Bluegrass and Waterfall stages. =Grandstand Shows= The Sam Rand Grandstand is home to several special events during the N.C. State Fair. The grandstand is the site of the annual Tractor Pull and Demolition Derby. In addition, there are performances by Keith King and the King Action Sports Stunt Show. The stunt show includes freestyle, flatlander, ramp riders, inline skaters, skateboarders and Motocross. =Kiddieland Fun Park= Kiddieland Fun Park, located near Gate 1, is nestled under the trees near the Kiddieland carnival area. This section of the N.C. State Fair caters to children with entertaining shows, rides and attractions, plus space to take a break from the Midway. =Carnival Rides and Games= People walk around the 2015 fair midway The N.C. State Fair has the largest midway at any state fair. Rides require tickets; some cost two to three tickets, while the wilder ones are five to six tickets. In 2006, Powers Great American Midways, based out of Burgaw, North Carolina (corporate office is in Corfu, New York) won the midway contract for the fair. The company provides more than 100 rides each year, as well as carnival games and concession stands on the midway. Since then, Powers Great American Midways has made steps to create an eco-friendly midway. These steps including the addition of LED lighting on nearly all the rides and using B20, a soybean-based biodiesel, to power all of the generators. In 2011, Powers unveiled the refurbished SkyDiver, which is similar to a Ferris wheel in shape. The difference is that passengers ride in cages and can spin the cages in a barrel roll fashion. The 90-foot-tall ride was completely overhauled with a spectacular lighting display composed of about 100,000 energy-efficient LED lights. Roller coasters In 2008, Susan Ogden of Raleigh helped name the Pinfarri RC-48 roller coaster when it premiered on the midway. The Toxic Shock is a blue and orange roller coaster that is known for twists and banked curves. =The Ride= The train makes a loose turn out of the station and up a steep lift hill. It then proceeds down a banked twisting drop and into the first of three over-banked curves. At the base of the third over-banked curve, the track stays moderately banked and around a 3.0 g helix. The track levels and pulls into the station. Another roller coaster, the Avalanche, is milder. The car pulls out of the station and around a 180-degree right turn onto the lift. The car ascends the lift and around another 180 turn to the right. The car then descends a drop, reaching 54 mph before climbing into the first banked curve. Around that and down a second drop that then takes you back up into the spiral, banking more heavily as you descend. You are warned about high g forces here but there are no strong g forces on this ride. When you finally exit the spiral, you descend a small dip and pull into the station. =The State Fair Flyer= The State Fair added a new way to get around in 2016 when they built the State Fair Flyer, a 40 foot high sky lift that has 126 seats that hang from a cable that stretches more than 1,400 feet across the fairgrounds. American Sky Lifts, based in Sanford, owns and built the massive machine at a cost of $1 million. A one-way trip on the State Fair Flyer costs $5, a round-trip ride is $8. The ride moves at 2 mph and has a lap restraint to keep passengers in their seat. American Sky Lifts has a 10-year lease to have the lift on the fairgrounds with an option for a 10-year renewal.http://www.wral.com/-new-state-fair-flyer-offers- one-heck-of-a-view-/16017955/ References External links * North Carolina State Fair website * Blue Ribbon Memories: Your History of the NC State Fair * Online archive of State Fair Premium Lists, 1860 to 2011, from the State Library of North Carolina. * Photo gallery: Food vendor stands at 2008 North Carolina State Fair Category:State fairs Category:Culture of Raleigh, North Carolina Category:October events Category:Tourist attractions in Raleigh, North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1928 Category:Buildings and structures in Raleigh, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Raleigh, North Carolina Category:Festivals established in 1853 ","title":"North Carolina State Fair"},{"id":"1146518","title":"National Union of Railwaymen"},{"id":"1146539","text":"The Sea Bright Skiff is a box-skegged skiff developed on the northern shore of New Jersey. It was used for fishing, by being launched through the surf, sailed to the fishing grounds, and returned through the surf. Description The boat is quite different from the Jersey Skiff, being more round-sided, with less freeboard, and the distinct \\"box skeg\\" that proved particularly useful when engines were adopted. The boat has a nearly straight stem, rounded sides, a narrow flat bottom that becomes the bottom of the skeg, and a heart shaped transom. The boat was usually rigged with a spritsail mainsail and small jib with an unstayed mast. The early fishing versions used an oar as the rudder, more modern versions, however, have a regular rudder & tiller. The larger pound boat, built to the same lines, was generally around 30 feet, but could run to 50 feet in length, 10 foot beam. It was used to carry to shore fish caught in offshore weirs. Like sardine carriers and oyster buy-boats, it was heavily laden on return, with very little freeboard. This boat has nearly disappeared from the shores of New Jersey except as used by lifeguards (rowing configuration only). A short video on the skiff can be found here.

On March 7, 1950, the Air Engineering Development Center was redesignated the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) effective February 10, 1950, per General Order #23, signed by then-Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg. Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) was later redesignated Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) on 6 July 2012. The complex is a part of a master unitary wind tunnel plan that is designated to provide the testing \\"tools\\" required to assure the United States continued air and space supremacy. The necessity for an aeronautical test complex of this type was recognized by a number of different agencies of the government, as well as by expert technical groups from the industrial-scientific world. The creation of these research and testing facilities has enabled the U.S. to stay abreast of developments in this fast-moving field. AEDC is the one of the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world with a replacement value of more than $7.8 billion. At one time or another, the center has operated 58 aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket and turbine engine test cells, space environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges and other specialized units. Twenty-seven of the center's test units have capabilities unmatched elsewhere in the United States; 14 are unique in the world. Facilities can simulate flight conditions from sea level to 300 miles' altitude and from subsonic velocities to Mach 14. AEDC's mission is to: • Test and evaluate aircraft, missile and space systems and subsystems at the flight conditions they will experience during a mission to help customers develop and qualify the systems for flight, improve system designs and establish performance before production. It also helps users troubleshoot problems with operational systems. • Conduct a research and technology program to develop advanced testing techniques and instrumentation and to support the design of new test facilities. Continuous improvement helps satisfy testing needs and keeps pace with rapidly advancing aircraft, missile and space system requirements. • Maintain and modernize the center's existing test facilities. AEDC is an important national resource and has contributed to the development of practically every one of the nation's top priority aerospace programs, including better spacelift, aircraft, missiles and satellites. Many of these programs are highlighted in the following sections. AEDC is an Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) organization managed by the Air Force but operated largely by a contractor work force. While AEDC's primary location is in Tennessee, it also operates two geographically separated facilities—the Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel 9 in Maryland, and the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC), in California. AEDC's economic impact to the local area for fiscal year 2008 exceeded $728 million. The total economic impact includes the center's payroll, secondary jobs created locally though the spending of that payroll, and other expenditures for supplies, utilities, fuel and services. As a consultant to General Arnold, Theodore von Kármán first called for the Center: :In 1947 Stuart Symington became the first secretary of the newly independent Air Force, and he strove hard to bring into reality some of my proposals, particularly the new facilities for Air Force research which I had urged in the report. Toward New Horizons from Governmentattic.org :One of the main items was a new U.S. center for the study and development of jet propulsion, supersonic aircraft, and ballistic missiles, a center I hoped would be greater than any then known. The proposal had actually begun after Frank Wattendorf's 1945 visit to the huge wind tunnel at Ötztal, Austria, which was bigger and more powerful than any in the United States.Frank Wattendorf (1945) \\"Reports on selected topics of German and Swiss Aeronautical Developments\\", v 3, pt 3, Toward New HorizonsTheodore von Kármán with Lee Edson (1967) The Wind and Beyond, chapter 37: A New Air Force Emerges, pp 298 to 309 :Symington managed to round up sufficient support in Congress and to obtain the necessary funds, about 100 million dollars. The Air Force agreed to go ahead with the proposal to set up the center, and a committee was appointed which traveled around the country seeking a suitable site. One of the necessary requirements was a direct source of stored hydraulic power, as planned at Ötztal, to run the multi-thousand horsepower motors needed for the big wind tunnels. :Senator McKellar, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, [made] a clever offer. He said the state of Tennessee would give up Camp Forest, a 40,000-acre World War II camp near Tullahoma, if the Air Force would set up its huge center there. Congress was about to adjourn and it looked like nothing would get done for another year. The Air Force, being realistic, accepted the offer ... The Arnold Engineering Development Center (as it was finally named) was dedicated in Tullahoma by President Truman in 1952. The center operates more than 68 aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket and turbine engine test cells, space environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges, and other specialized units. Currently, AEDC's prime contractor is the Aerospace Testing Alliance. The center has helped to develop most aerospace systems in the U.S. government's inventory, including the Atlas, Titan, Minuteman and Peacekeeper ICBMs, the Space Shuttle, space station, and Projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. It is named for General Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold, the father of the US Air Force and an air power visionary. The University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) is located adjacent to AEDC. The center lies near Manchester, Tennessee and Tullahoma, Tennessee, and occupies much of the site of the former Camp Forrest, a U.S. Army base and World War II POW camp. It is unique in that the majority of the workforce are contract personnel, with a small contingent of active-duty assigned.

The basic design is much older and of European ancestry. It strongly resembles a sailing ship's gig or a Thames river wherry used by watermen as a taxi service. They were first made in the U.S. at the foot of Whitehall Street in New York City to be used to ferry goods, services, and sailors on and off the boats coming into New York Harbor. The boats range from 14 to 22 ft in length, the larger requiring two people to row them. A Whitehall gig, which is the slightly longer version is 25 ft in length, requiring four rowers and a coxswain for a crew of 5. They were the first boats to incorporate an inverted-hull frame set up to speed up the manufacturing process. The hull shape is characterized by a nearly straight stem, and slight flare to the bow, rounded sides, with a keel running the entire length of the bottom and a distinctive wine glass transom with a full skeg. Considered one of the most beautiful row-boats, they are designed to handle the harbor chop and yet track straight. Speed was the issue with these boats, as the first to the ship with the goods generally received the lion's share of the sales. Later the shore patrol used these boats for customs, police issues, water taxi, and newspaper reporting. Whitehalls in the early 20th century were a popular recreational boat and were known as the \\"bicycle of the sea\\". A beginning rower finds it easier to row this design in a straight line because of the tracking type keel. Turning requires stronger strokes on one side, and by braking with one oar and pulling with the other the boat can be turned in its own length. Whitehall designs are currently being built in wood, and also manufactured fiberglass usually with wood trims, and more recently thermoformed in co-polymer plastic. These boats are either traditional fixed seat row boats or slide seat rowing boats. Some models or also including sailing rigs. Many designs are mistakenly being called Whitehalls when they are not actually true to the design criteria. The Mystic Seaport Maritime Museum has a comprehensive collection of authentic Whitehall lines. The Village Community Boathouse in New York City has dedicated its boatbuiding programhttp://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/2014/03/building- whitehall-gigs/ to almost exclusively building and restoring wooden Whitehall Gigs. They have built dozens over the last decade, most of which are available for free public use at their boathousehttps://www.hudsonriverpark.org/explore- the-park/activities/boat-building-at-pier-40 on Pier 40 while others have been loaned or donated to sister organizations.

The dock is situated between East Float and Morpeth Dock, within Birkenhead's dock system. History The dock was the second named as Egerton Dock along the Mersey, the first being the forerunner to Harrington Dock. Named after Sir Philip de Malpas Grey Egerton who laid the foundation stone in October 1844, the dock was completed in 1847. This was just prior to a suspension of the dock scheme, due to a financial crisis affecting the Birkenhead Dock Company. The dock was originally accessible to shipping from the East Float and via the Morpeth Dock entrance from the River Mersey. Both these passages have since been filled in, making both docks effectively landlocked. For the majority of its use, it served the LNWR and CLC goods stations which adjoined the dock. The LNWR had a warehouse, on the southern quayside, much used for storing bananas. The dock was partially filled in 1991, removing access from East Float.  Egerton Bridge  Egerton Bridge Egerton Bridge is situated between Egerton Dock and Morpeth Dock and is a working example of a bascule bridge. It was built between 1928 and 1931, as one of four similar bascule bridges in the Merseyside docks, replacing an earlier swing bridge. The bridge and the machine house were completely restored in 1993 and opened to the public in 1995.

The dock is situated between the River Mersey and Egerton Dock. History Built between 1844 and 1847, it is named after Lord Morpeth, the 7th Earl of Carlisle, who was the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests. The dock was opened in 1847, and the branch dock was built between 1866 and 1868. By 1872, the dock had been significantly remodelled with the branch dock and a canal basin for the GWR's goods station. Morpeth Dock Goods station was used by the GWR as the Birkenhead end of cross-river traffic to the Manchester Dock. Morpeth Dock provided berths for the Bibby Line, the Brocklebank Line, Holt and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, all of which worked to the Far East. The branch dock proved to be too small for ships, and was used to site one of the Queensway Tunnel ventilation towers in 1934, along with a water pumping station in 1955. The pumping station later became a water treatment plant, now replacing the entire basin of the branch dock. Originally, the dock connected directly to the River Mersey via the locks of the Morpeth River Entrance, although the entrance channel has since been partially infilled and the locks removed after being disused for some years. Access to the Great Float via Egerton Dock has also been removed, making both docks effectively landlocked. The dockside sheds of the former Morpeth Branch Dock were restored around 1992, and now contain the Pacific Road Business Centre. One O'Clock Gun The One O'Clock Gun. Situated close to the dock and overlooking the river, the One O'Clock Gun provided a time signal to shipping on the Mersey. It was fired electrically from Bidston Observatory for the first time on 21 September 1867 and the original cannon was a relic of the Crimean War. Due to the advent of radio and increasing maintenance costs, by 1932 it was proposed to discontinue the practice. Although this did not occur, firing was suspended during the Second World War. The tradition ceased altogether on 18 July 1969. A One O'Clock Gun is still fired at Edinburgh Castle. Bomb discovery Birkenhead docks, as well as the surrounding area, were heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. In May 2006, a 60-year-old, 500kg (1,102lb) bomb was discovered by the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Group and disposed of by the minesweeper HMS Atherstone. It was found embedded in mud in the river, near to the former entrance to Morpeth Dock and may have been disturbed during dredging work at the Twelve Quays ferry terminal. The bomb was later detonated in Liverpool Bay.

It runs from downtown Orlando northwest to Apopka and Tavares with a branch from Toronto to Ocoee and Winter Garden and branches from Tavares to Umatilla and Sorrento. The Florida Central connects with the Central Florida Rail Corridor in downtown Orlando, Florida and has trackage rights on the CFRC from there south to Taft Yard where they interchange with CSX Transportation. The railroad is based out of the Plymouth freight station. History Orlando area, including the Florida Central Railroad The tracks that the Florida Central Railroad operate on were once part of a few independent railroads that were built mostly in the 1880s that were eventually merged into a single system. =Orlando to Tavares= The main route of the Florida Central Railroad from Tavares to Orlando was originally built by the Tavares, Orlando and Atlantic Railroad. It was incorporated in 1883, and built as an extension of the Leesburg and Indian River Railroad, which branched off the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad in Wildwood and ran through Leesburg to Tavares. The FC&P; leased the line in 1891, which became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1900. This line west of Tavares west was abandoned in the 1970s. A wye on the CSX S Line (former Seaboard main line) near Wildwood Yard is what remains of the connection. =Tavares to Umatilla= The Florida Central Railroad branch from Tavares to Umatilla was originally part of the St. Johns and Lake Eustis Railway. This company was chartered in 1879 and was completed in 1882-83.Saint Johns River Historical Society, Inc. - The Railroad It extended as far north as Astor on the St. Johns River when it was first built. In 1893, the St. Johns & Lake Eustis Railway became part of the Plant System and was converted to standard gauge. The Plant System would become part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. =Tavares to Sorrento= The branch from Tavares to Sorrento was part of the Sanford and Lake Eustis Railway which was completed in 1887. It extended as far east as Sanford when built. The line was immediately leased to the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway, which was part of the Plant System and subsequently, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Track east of Sorrento to Sylvan Lake was abandoned in 1980. =Toronto to Winter Garden= The branch from Toronto to Winter Garden was built by the Orange Belt Railway from Toronto to Clarcona, and the Florida Midland Railway (not to be confused with Regional Rail, LLC's Florida Midland Railroad) from Clarcona to Winter Garden. The Orange Belt Railway was completed in 1886 and the Florida Midland Railway was completed around the same time. Those lines would also become part of the Plant System and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. =Later History= The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads merged in 1967 which brought all of the trackage under a single owner, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation. On November 21, 1986, the newly formed Florida Central Railroad Company, Incorporated leased the lines from CSX from Toronto west and each of the branches. The line from Toronto southeast to Orlando was still run by CSX until September 28, 1990, when the Florida Central Railroad leased the rest of the line from Toronto to the CSX A Line (now the Central Florida Rail Corridor) in Orlando. On October 1, 1998, an agreement was signed between the railroad and other affected parties to abandon the line between Ocoee and Winter Garden west of Boyd Street, and the line to Diamond R Fertilizer west of 9th St, and build a new connector east of Winter Garden. This would eliminate grade crossings in downtown Winter Garden; trains had to go to the west end of downtown and then reverse direction along the other track to reach Diamond R Fertilizer. As the West Orange Trail was built before this, there is a fence separating it from the former railroad east of downtown Winter Garden. On November 24, 2003, the Florida Central Railroad was granted an easement for a new connector track in the northwest corner at Toronto. Once this was built, the track crossing the mainline was removed, and the Forest City Branch was abandoned. Renovations to 57 miles between the CSX connection in Orlando, and the terminus in Umatilla, Florida, began in September, 2013. The $18.4 million project received funding from various counties, the Florida Department of Transportation, FCEN itself, as well as a $2.2 million granthttp://www.fra.dot.gov/eLib/details/L04511 from the Federal Railroad Administration’s Rail Line Relocation program. The upgrades, which include replacing the current track with continuously welded rail, improving the bridge over the Dora Canal, improving grade crossings and tie replacement, as well as increase the speed limit of the line, from 10 mph to 25 mph. Upgrades to the line are in hopes of future commuter rail use, connecting Apopka, Tavares, and Orlando along FCEN track. In November 2019, former owner Pinsly Railroad Company sold the Florida Central, along with the Florida Midland Railroad and Florida Northern Railroad, to 3i RR Holdings GP, LLC and subsidiaries (d.b.a. \\"Regional Rail, LLC\\").

Nuclear facility Natanz nuclear facility, located some 30 km NNW from the town () near a major highway, is generally recognized as Iran's central facility for uranium enrichment with over 19,000 gas centrifuges currently operational and nearly half of them being fed with uranium hexafluoride. Enrichment of uranium at the plant was halted in July 2004 during negotiations with European countries. In 2006, Iran announced that it would resume enrichment. In September 2007, the Iranian government announced that they had installed 3,000 centrifuges at Natanz. In 2010, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was told by the Iranian government that future enrichment programmes would take place at Natanz, and they would start in March 2011. In January 2013, Fereydoun Abbasi from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said: \\"five percent uranium enrichment is continuing at Natanz, and we will continue 20 percent enrichment at Fordo and Natanz to meet our needs\\". Daily inspection by the IAEA of the Natanz site was agreed as part of the nuclear enrichment reduction agreement made with the P5+1 countries in November 2013. Between 2007–2010 Natanz nuclear power plant was hit by a sophisticated cyber attack that has been alleged to have been carried out in an operation called Olympic Games by a coalition of German, French, British, American, Dutch and Israeli intelligence organizations. The attack used a Stuxnet worm which hampered the operation of plant's centrifuges and caused damage to them over time. The alleged goal of the cyber attack was not to destroy the nuclear program of Iran completely but to stall it enough for sanctions and diplomacy to take effect. This alleged goal was achieved, as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear treaty with Iran was reached in July 2015. On 2 July 2020, a fire and explosion hit around 2 a.m. local time a centrifuge production plant at a nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. A group known as the \\"Cheetahs of the Homeland\\" claimed responsibility for the attack. Some Iranian officials suggested that the incident may have been caused by cyber sabotage.

Raku introduces elements of many modern and historical languages. Compatibility with Perl was not a goal, though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. The design process for Raku began in 2000. History The Raku design process was first announced on 19 July 2000, on the fourth day of that year's Perl Conference, by Larry Wall in his State of the Onion 2000 talk. At that time, the primary goals were to remove \\"historical warts\\" from the language; \\"easy things should stay easy, hard things should get easier, and impossible things should get hard\\"; a general cleanup of the internal design and APIs. The process began with a series of requests for comments or \\"RFCs\\". This process was open to all contributors, and left no aspect of the language closed to change. Once the RFC process was complete, Wall reviewed and classified each request (361 were received). He then began the process of writing several \\"Apocalypses\\", a term which means \\"revealing\\". While the original goal was to write one Apocalypse for each chapter of Programming Perl, it became obvious that, as each Apocalypse was written, previous Apocalypses were being invalidated by later changes. For this reason, a set of Synopses were published, each one relating the contents of an Apocalypse, but with any subsequent changes reflected in updates. Today, the Raku specification is managed through the \\"roast\\" testing suite, while the Synopses are kept as a historical reference. There are also a series of Exegeses written by Damian Conway that explain the content of each Apocalypse in terms of practical usage. Each Exegesis consists of code examples along with discussion of the usage and implications of the examples. There are three primary methods of communication used in the development of Raku today. The first is the IRC channel on freenode. The second is a set of mailing lists on The Perl Foundation's servers at perl.org. The third is the Git source code repository hosted at https://github.com/raku. =Initial goals and implications= The major goal Wall suggested in his initial speech was the removal of historical warts. These included the confusion surrounding sigil usage for containers; the ambiguity between the \`select\` functions; the syntactic impact of bareword filehandles. There were many other problems that Perl programmers had discussed fixing for years and these were explicitly addressed by Wall in his speech. An implication of these goals was that Perl 6 would not have backward compatibility with the existing Perl codebase. This meant that some code which was correctly interpreted by a Perl 5 compiler would not be accepted by a Perl 6 compiler. Since backward compatibility is a common goal when enhancing software, the breaking changes in Perl 6 had to be stated explicitly. The distinction between Perl 5 and Perl 6 became so large that eventually Perl 6 was renamed Raku. Over the years, Raku has undergone several alterations in its direction. The introduction of concepts from Python and Ruby were early influences. Furthermore, since Pugs - the first interpreter able to run Raku - was written in the Haskell programming language, many functional programming influences were absorbed by the Raku design team. =Mascot= Larry Wall and Camelia The language's mascot is \\"Camelia, the Raku bug\\". Her name is a nod to the camel mascot associated with Perl, and her form, in the pun-loving tradition of the Perl community, is a play on \\"software bug\\". Spiral designs embedded in her butterfly-like wings resemble the characters \\"P6\\", the favored nickname for Perl 6, and off-center eye placement is an intentional pun on \\"Wall-eyed\\". One of the goals behind the lively and colorful design of the logo was to discourage misogyny in the community and for it to be an opportunity for those of \\"masculine persuasion\\" to show their sensitive side. Implementations , only the Rakudo implementation is under active development. No implementation will be designated as the official Raku implementation; rather, \\"Raku is anything that passes the official test suite.\\" Rakudo Perl 6 targets a number of virtual machines, such as MoarVM, the Java Virtual Machine, and JavaScript. MoarVM is a virtual machine built especially for Rakudo and the NQP Compiler Toolchain. There is a layer between Raku and the virtual machines called Not Quite Perl 6, or NQP, which implements Raku rules for parsing Raku, as well as an abstract syntax tree and backend-specific code generation. Large portions of Rakudo are written in Raku itself, or in its subset NQP. Rakudo is not a completely self-hosting implementation, nor are there concrete plans at this point to make Rakudo a bootstrapping compiler. =Historical implementations= Pugs was an initial implementation of Perl 6 written in Haskell. Pugs used to be the most advanced implementation of Perl 6, but since mid 2007 it is mostly dormant (with updates made only to track the current version of GHC). As of November 2014 Pugs was not being actively maintained. In 2007, v6-MiniPerl6 (\\"mp6\\") and its reimplementation, v6-KindaPerl6 (\\"kp6\\") were written as a means to bootstrap the Perl-6.0.0 STD, using Perl 5. The STD is a full grammar for Perl 6 and is written in Perl 6. In theory, anything capable of parsing the STD and generating executable code is a suitable bootstrapping system for Perl 6. kp6 is currently compiled by mp6 and can work with multiple backends. mp6 and kp6 are not full Perl 6 implementations and are designed only to implement the minimum featureset required to bootstrap a full Perl 6 compiler. Yapsi is a Perl 6 compiler and runtime written in Perl 6 itself. As a result, it requires an existing Perl 6 interpreter, such as one of the Rakudo Star releases, in order to run. Niecza, another major Perl 6 implementation effort, focused on optimization and efficient implementation research. It targets the Common Language Infrastructure. Module system The Raku specification requests that modules be identified by name, version, and authority. It is possible to load only a specific version of a module, or even two modules of the same name that differ in version or authority. As a convenience, aliasing to a short name is provided. CPAN, the Perl module distribution system, does not yet handle Raku modules. Instead a prototype module system is in use. Major changes from Perl Perl and Raku differ fundamentally, though in general the intent has been to \\"keep Raku Perl\\", so that Raku is clearly \\"a Perl programming language\\". Most of the changes are intended to normalize the language, to make it easier for novice and expert programmers alike to understand, and to make \\"easy things easier and hard things more possible\\". =A specification= A major non-technical difference between Perl and Raku is that Raku began as a specification. This means that Raku can be re-implemented if needed, and it also means that programmers do not have to read the source code for the ultimate authority on any given feature. The official documentation is not considered authoritative and only describes the behavior of the actual Perl interpreter informally. Any discrepancies found between the documentation and the implementation may lead to either being changed to reflect the other, a dynamic which drives the continuing development and refinement of the Perl releases. =A type system= In Raku, the dynamic type system of Perl has been augmented by the addition of static types. For example: my Int $i = 0; my Rat $r = 3.142; my Str $s = \\"Hello, world\\"; However, static typing remains optional, so programmers can do most things without any explicit typing at all: my $i = \\"25\\" + 10; # $i is 35 Raku offers a gradual typing system, whereby the programmer may choose to use static typing, use dynamic typing, or mix the two. =Formal subroutine parameter lists= Perl defines subroutines without formal parameter lists at all (though simple parameter counting and some very loose type checking can be done using Perl's \\"prototypes\\"). Subroutine arguments passed in are aliased into the elements of the array \`@_\`. If the elements of \`@_\` are modified, the changes are reflected in the original data. Raku introduces true formal parameters to the language. In Raku, a subroutine declaration looks like this: sub do_something(Str $thing, Int $other) { ... } As in Perl, the formal parameters (i.e., the variables in the parameter list) are aliases to the actual parameters (the values passed in), but by default, the aliases are constant so they cannot be modified. They may be declared explicitly as read-write aliases for the original value or as copies using the \`is rw\` or \`is copy\` directives respectively should the programmer require them to be modified locally. Parameter passing modes Raku provides three basic modes of parameter passing: positional parameters, named parameters, and slurpy parameters. Positional parameters are the typical ordered list of parameters that most programming languages use. All parameters may also be passed by using their name in an unordered way. Named-only parameters (indicated by a \`:\` before the parameter name) can only be passed by specifying its name, i.e. it never captures a positional argument. Slurpy parameters (indicated by an \`*\` before the parameter name) are Raku's tool for creating variadic functions. A slurpy hash will capture remaining passed-by- name parameters, whereas a slurpy array will capture remaining passed-by- position parameters. Here is an example of the use of all three parameter- passing modes: sub somefunction($a, $b, :$c, :$d, *@e) { ... } somefunction(1, 2, :d(3), 4, 5, 6); # $a=1, $b=2, $d=3, @e=(4,5,6) Positional parameters, such as those used above, are always required unless followed by \`?\` to indicate that they are optional. Named parameters are optional by default, but may be marked as required by adding \`!\` after the variable name. Slurpy parameters are always optional. Blocks and closures Parameters can also be passed to arbitrary blocks, which act as closures. This is how, for example, \`for\` and \`while\` loop iterators are named. In the following example, a list is traversed, 3 elements at a time, and passed to the loop's block as the variables, \`$a, $b, $c\`. for @list -> $a, $b, $c { ... } This is generally referred to as a \\"pointy sub\\" or \\"pointy block\\", and the arrow behaves almost exactly like the \`sub\` keyword, introducing an anonymous closure (or anonymous subroutine in Perl terminology). =Sigil invariance= In Perl, sigils - the punctuation characters that precede a variable name - change depending on how the variable is used: # Perl code my array = ('a', 'b', 'c'); my $element = array[1]; # $element equals 'b', my @extract = array[1, 2]; # @extract equals ('b', 'c') my $element = array[1]; # 'b' comes with a warning (5.10 option) In Raku, sigils are invariant, which means that they do not change based on whether it is the array or the array element that is needed: # Raku code my array = 'a', 'b', 'c'; my $element = array[1]; # $element equals 'b' my @extract = array[1]; # @extract equals ('b') my @extract = array[1, 2]; # @extract equals ('b', 'c') The variance in Perl is inspired by number agreement in English and many other natural languages: \\"This apple.\\" # $a CORRECT \\"These apples.\\" # @a CORRECT \\"This third apple.\\" # $a[3] CORRECT \\"These third apple.\\" # @a[3] WRONG However, this conceptual mapping breaks down when references come into play, since they may refer to data structures even though they are scalars. Thus, dealing with nested data structures may require an expression of both singular and plural form in a single term: # Perl code: retrieve a list from the leaf of a hash containing hashes that contain arrays my @trans_verbs = @{ $dictionary{ 'verb' }{ 'transitive' } }; This complexity has no equivalent either in common use of natural language or in other programming languages, and it causes high cognitive load when writing code to manipulate complex data structures. This is the same code in Raku: # Raku code: retrieve a list from the leaf of a hash containing hashes that contain arrays my @trans_verbs = %dictionary<>; =Object-oriented programming= Perl supports object-oriented programming via a mechanism known as blessing. Any reference can be blessed into being an object of a particular class. A blessed object can have methods invoked on it using the \\"arrow syntax\\" which will cause Perl to locate or \\"dispatch\\" an appropriate subroutine by name, and call it with the blessed variable as its first argument. While extremely powerful, it makes the most common case of object orientation, a struct-like object with some associated code, unnecessarily difficult. In addition, because Perl can make no assumptions about the object model in use, method invocation cannot be optimized very well. In the spirit of making the \\"easy things easy and hard things possible\\", Raku retains the blessing model and supplies a more robust object model for the common cases. For example, a class to encapsulate a Cartesian point could be defined and used this way: class Point is rw { has $.x; has $.y; method distance( Point $p ) { sqrt(($!x - $p.x) ** 2 + ($!y - $p.y) ** 2) } method distance-to-center { self.distance: Point.new(x=> 0, y => 0) } } my $point = Point.new( x => 1.2, y => -3.7 ); say \\"Point's location: (\\", $point.x, ', ', $point.y, ')'; # OUTPUT: Point's location: (1.2, -3.7) # Changing x and y (note methods \\"x\\" and \\"y\\" used as lvalues): $point.x = 3; $point.y = 4; say \\"Point's location: (\\", $point.x, ', ', $point.y, ')'; # OUTPUT: Point's location: (3, 4) my $other-point = Point.new(x => -5, y => 10); $point.distance($other-point); #=> 10 $point.distance-to-center; #=> 5 The dot replaces the arrow in a nod to the many other languages (e.g. C++, Java, Python, etc.) that have coalesced around dot as the syntax for method invocation. In the terminology of Raku, \`$.x\` is called an \\"attribute\\". Some languages call these fields or members. The method used to access an attribute is called an \\"accessor\\". An auto-accessor method is a method created automatically and named after the attribute's name, as the method \`x\` is in the example above. These accessor functions return the value of the attribute. When a class or individual attribute is declared with the \`is rw\` modifier (short for \\"read/write\\"), the auto-accessors can be passed a new value to set the attribute to, or it can be directly assigned to as an lvalue (as in the example). Auto-accessors can be replaced by user-defined methods, should the programmer desire a richer interface to an attribute. Attributes can only be accessed directly from within a class definition via the \`$!\` syntax regardless of how the attributes are declared. All other access must go through the accessor methods. The Raku object system has inspired the Moose framework that introduces many of Raku's OOP features to Perl. Inheritance, Roles and Classes Inheritance is the technique by which an object or type can re-use code or definitions from existing objects or types. For example, a programmer may want to have a standard type but with an extra attribute. Inheritance in other languages, such as Java, is provided by allowing Classes to be sub-classes of existing classes. Raku provides for inheritance via Classes, which are similar to Classes in other languages, and Roles. Roles in Raku take on the function of interfaces in Java, mixins in Ruby, and traits in the Smalltalk variant Squeak. These are much like classes, but they provide a safer composition mechanism. These are used to perform composition when used with classes rather than adding to their inheritance chain. Roles define nominal types; they provide semantic names for collections of behavior and state. The fundamental difference between a role and a class is that classes can be instantiated; roles are not. Although Roles are distinct from Classes, it is possible to write Raku code that directly instantiates a Role or uses a Role as a type object, Raku will automatically create a class with the same name as the role, making it possible to transparently use a role as if it were a class. Essentially, a role is a bundle of (possibly abstract) methods and attributes that can be added to a class without using inheritance. A role can even be added to an individual object; in this case, Raku will create an anonymous subclass, add the role to the subclass, and change the object's class to the anonymous subclass. For example, a Dog is a Mammal because dogs inherit certain characteristics from Mammals, such as mammary glands and (through Mammal's parent, Vertebrate) a backbone. On the other hand, dogs also may have one of several distinct types of behavior, and these behaviours may change over time. For example, a Dog may be a Pet, a Stray (an abandoned pet will acquire behaviours to survive not associated with a pet), or a Guide for the blind (guide dogs are trained, so they do not start life as guide dogs). However, these are sets of additional behaviors that can be added to a Dog. It is also possible to describe these behaviors in such a way that they can be usefully applied to other animals, for example, a Cat can equally be a Pet or Stray. Hence, Dog and Cat are both distinct from each other, while both remaining within the more general category Mammal. So Mammal is a Class and Dog and Cat are classes that inherit from Mammal. But the behaviours associated with Pet, Stray, and Guide are Roles that can be added to Classes, or objects instantiated from Classes. class Mammal is Vertebrate { ... } class Dog is Mammal { ... } role Pet { ... } role Stray { ... } role Guide { ... } Roles are added to a class or object with the \`does\` keyword. In order to show inheritance from a class, there is a different keyword \`is\`. The keywords reflect the differing meanings of the two features: role composition gives a class the behavior of the role, but doesn't indicate that it is truly the same thing as the role. class GuideDog is Dog does Guide { ... } # Subclass composes role my $dog = new Dog; $dog does Guide; # Individual object composes role Although roles are distinct from classes, both are types, so a role can appear in a variable declaration where one would normally put a class. For example, a Blind role for a Human could include an attribute of type Guide; this attribute could contain a Guide Dog, a Guide Horse, a Guide Human, or even a Guide Machine. class Human { has Dog $dog; # Can contain any kind of Dog, whether it does the ... # Guide role or not } role Blind { has Guide $guide; # Can contain any object that does the Guide role, ... # whether it is a Dog or something else } =Regular expressions= Perl's regular expression and string-processing support has always been one of its defining features. Since Perl's pattern-matching constructs have exceeded the capabilities of regular language expressions for some time, Raku documentation will exclusively refer to them as regexes, distancing the term from the formal definition. Raku provides a superset of Perl features with respect to regexes, folding them into a larger framework called \\"rules\\" which provide the capabilities of context-sensitive parsing formalisms (such as the syntactic predicates of parsing expression grammars and ANTLR), as well as acting as a closure with respect to their lexical scope. Rules are introduced with the \`rule\` keyword which has a usage quite similar to subroutine definition. Anonymous rules can also be introduced with the \`regex\` (or \`rx\`) keyword, or they can simply be used inline as regexps were in Perl via the \`m\` (matching) or \`s\` (substitute) operators. In Apocalypse 5, Larry Wall enumerated 20 problems with \\"current regex culture\\". Among these were that Perl's regexes were \\"too compact and 'cute'\\", had \\"too much reliance on too few metacharacters\\", \\"little support for named captures\\", \\"little support for grammars\\", and \\"poor integration with 'real' language\\". =Syntactic simplification= Some Perl constructs have been changed in Raku, optimized for different syntactic cues for the most common cases. For example, the parentheses (round brackets) required in control flow constructs in Perl are now optional: if is_true() { for @array { ... } } Also, the \`,\` (comma) operator is now a list constructor, so enclosing parentheses are no longer required around lists. The code @array = 1, 2, 3, 4; now makes \`@array\` an array with exactly the elements '1', '2', '3', and '4'. =Chained comparisons= Raku allows comparisons to \\"chain\\". That is, a sequence of comparisons such as the following is allowed: if 20 <= $temperature <= 25 { say \\"Room temperature is between 20 and 25!\\" } This is treated as if each left-to-right comparison were performed on its own, and the result is logically combined via the \`and\` operation. =Lazy evaluation= Raku uses the technique of lazy evaluation of lists that has been a feature of some functional programming languages such as Haskell: @integers = 0..Inf; # integers from 0 to infinity The code above will not crash by attempting to assign a list of infinite size to the array \`@integers\`, nor will it hang indefinitely in attempting to expand the list if a limited number of slots are searched. This simplifies many common tasks in Raku including input/output operations, list transformations, and parameter passing. =Gather= Related to lazy evaluation is the construction of lazy lists using \`gather\` and \`take\`, behaving somewhat like generators in languages like Icon or Python. my $squares = lazy gather for 0..Inf { take $_ * $_; }; \`$squares\` will be an infinite list of square numbers, but lazy evaluation of the \`gather\` ensures that elements are only computed when they are accessed. =Junctions= Raku introduces the concept of junctions: values that are composites of other values. In their simplest form, junctions are created by combining a set of values with junctive operators: # Example for  (\\"any\\") Junction: my $color = 'white'; unless $color eq 'white'  'black'  'gray'  'grey' { die \\"Color printing not supported \\"; } # Example for & (\\"all\\") Junction: my $password = 'secret!123'; if $password ~~ /<:alpha>/ & /<:digit>/ & /<:punct>/ { say \\"Your password is reasonably secure\\"; } \`\` indicates a value which is equal to either its left- or right-hand arguments. \`&\` indicates a value which is equal to both its left- and right-hand arguments. These values can be used in any code that would use a normal value. Operations performed on a junction act on all members of the junction equally, and combine according to the junctive operator. So, \`(\\"apple\\"\\"banana\\") ~ \\"s\\"\` would yield \`\\"apples\\"\\"bananas\\"\`. In comparisons, junctions return a single true or false result for the comparison. \\"\`any\`\\" junctions return true if the comparison is true for any one of the elements of the junction. \\"\`all\`\\" junctions return true if the comparison is true for all of the elements of the junction. Junctions can also be used to more richly augment the type system by introducing a style of generic programming that is constrained to junctions of types: subset Color of Any where RGB_Color  CMYK_Color; sub get_tint(Color $color, Num $opacity) { ... } =Macros= In low-level languages, the concept of macros has become synonymous with textual substitution of source-code due to the widespread use of the C preprocessor. However, high-level languages such as Lisp pre-dated C in their use of macros that were far more powerful. It is this Lisp-like macro concept that Raku will take advantage of. The power of this sort of macro stems from the fact that it operates on the program as a high-level data structure, rather than as simple text, and has the full capabilities of the programming language at its disposal. A Raku macro definition will look like a subroutine or method definition, and it can operate on unparsed strings, an AST representing pre-parsed code, or a combination of the two. A macro definition would look like this: macro hello($what) { quasi { say \\"Hello { {} }\\" }; } In this particular example, the macro is no more complex than a C-style textual substitution, but because parsing of the macro parameter occurs before the macro operates on the calling code, diagnostic messages would be far more informative. However, because the body of a macro is executed at compile time each time it is used, many techniques of optimization can be employed. It is even possible to entirely eliminate complex computations from resulting programs by performing the work at compile-time. =Identifiers= In Perl, identifier names can use the ASCII alphanumerics and underscores also available in other languages. In Raku, the alphanumerics can include most Unicode characters. In addition, hyphens and apostrophes can be used (with certain restrictions, such as not being followed by a digit). Using hyphens instead of underscores to separate words in a name leads to a style of naming called \\"kebab case\\". Examples =Hello world= The hello world program is a common program used to introduce a language. In Raku, hello world is: say 'Hello, world'; -- though there is more than one way to do it. =Factorial= The factorial function in Raku, defined in a few different ways: # Using recursion (with \`if\\\\else\` construct) sub fact( UInt $n --> UInt ) { if $n  0 { 1 } else { $n * fact($n-1) } } # Using recursion (with \`if\` as statement modifier) sub fact( UInt $n --> UInt ) { return 1 if $n  0; return $n * fact($n-1); } # Using recursion (with \`when\` construct) sub fact( UInt $n --> UInt ) { when $n  0 { 1 } default { $n * fact($n-1) } } # Using the ternary operator sub fact( UInt $n --> UInt ) { $n  0 ?? 1 !! $n * fact($n-1) } # Using multiple dispatch multi fact(0) { 1 } multi fact( UInt $n --> UInt ) { $n * fact($n - 1) } # Using the reduction metaoperator multi fact( UInt $n --> UInt ) { [*] 1..$n } # Creating a factorial operator and using the reduction metaoperator sub postfix:( UInt $n --> UInt ) { [*] 1..$n } # Using \`state\` declarator to create a memoized factorial sub fact( UInt $n --> UInt ) { state %known = 0 => 1; return %known{$n} if %known{$n}:exists; %known{$n} = $n * fact($n-1); return %known{$n}; } =Quicksort= Quicksort is a well-known sorting algorithm. A working implementation using the functional programming paradigm can be succinctly written in Raku: # Empty list sorts to the empty list multi quicksort([]) { () } # Otherwise, extract first item as pivot... multi quicksort([$pivot, *@rest]) { # Partition. my @before = @rest.grep(* before $pivot); my @after = @rest.grep(* after $pivot); # Sort the partitions. flat (quicksort(@before), $pivot, quicksort(@after)) } =Tower of Hanoi= Tower of Hanoi is often used to introduce recursive programming in computer science. This implementation uses Raku's multi- dispatch mechanism and parametric constraints: multi sub hanoi(0, $, $, $) # No disk, so do not do anything multi sub hanoi($n, $a = 'A', $b = 'B', $c = 'C') { # Start with $n disks and three pegs A, B, C hanoi $n - 1, $a, $c, $b; # firstly move top $n - 1 disks from A to B say \\"Move disk $n from peg $a to peg $c\\"; # then move last disk from A to C hanoi $n - 1, $b, $a, $c; # lastly move $n - 1 disks from B to C }  Books  In the history of Raku there were two waves of book writing. The first wave followed the initial announcement of Perl 6 in 2000. Those books reflect the state of the design of the language of that time, and contain mostly outdated material. The second wave, that followed the announcement of Version 1.0 in 2015, includes several books that have already been published and some others that are in the process of being written. = Books published before Perl 6 version 1.0 (known as version 6.c) = * A.

History In 1962 in New York City, Lestine Johnson and sisters Ernestine Pearce, Shirley Pearce and Betty Pearce from South Carolina formed The Gypsies. In 1964 they signed to Old Town Records, where they released their debut single \\"Hey There, Hey There\\". The song achieved airplay only on local radio stations, but their next single — the J.J. Jackson-written \\"Jerk It\\" — was more successful, reaching #111 (pop) and #33 (R&B;) in the spring of 1965. Despite the relative success of \\"Jerk It\\", Lestine Johnson left the group, replaced by Viola Billups. The Gypsies released only two singles on Old Town Records in 1966, giving them a total of four. That year, now on Josie Records, the four women renamed themselves The Flirtations and released the well-regarded northern soul dancer \\"Change My Darkness Into Light\\". It was ignored by DJs and sales suffered. The quartet then moved to the Jamie-Guyden distributed label Festival Records, where they released \\"Stronger Than Her Love\\" and \\"Settle Down\\" as a single, which failed to spark much interest. Betty Pearce left the group, reducing the Flirtations to a trio. After winning a small local talent contest in 1968 to see who could sound the most like the Supremes, they packed their bags and headed for England, where they signed to the Parrot label and in the fall of 1968 supported the label's star act Tom Jones on his European tour. The Flirtations' sole Parrot release was \\"Someone Out There\\", backed with \\"How Can You Tell Me?\\" \\"Someone Out There\\" rose to second place on the \\"Bubbling Under\\" list in September 1968, and the track did afford the Flirtations a chart hit in the Netherlands with a No. 25 peak. In late 1968 the trio signed with Deram Records and released what would become their signature recording, \\"Nothing But A Heartache\\" — a dense, dynamic, earth-shattering melodrama produced by Englishman Wayne Bickerton and written by Bickerton with Tony Waddington. The B-side was a Christmas song, \\"Christmastime Is Here Again\\". \\"Nothing But a Heartache\\" rose to first place on the \\"Bubbling Under\\" list in December 1968 and gave the Flirtations a second Top 40 hit in the Netherlands, reaching No. 36 in early 1969. Following an unsuccessful December 1968 US release, \\"Nothing But a Heartache\\" was re-issued in the US in early 1969, with \\"How Can You Tell Me?\\" now replacing the original seasonal B-side. \\"Nothing But a Heartache\\" debuted at No. 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 8 March 1969. The single reached the Top 20 in several US markets - its chart peak in Boston was No. 3 - but the staggered regional success indicated by its 14-week Hot 100 run dictated that its national peak - achieved on the 24 May 1969 Hot 100 - would be No. 34. (The Cash Box singles chart peak for \\"Nothing But a Heartache\\" was No. 31.) Somewhat reminiscent of mid-1960s Supremes – particularly \\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\" — the single is now generally regarded as a pop and Northern soul classic.\\"Various Artists - Northern Soul: 20 Original Classics (Spectrum)\\", Modculture, 13 March 2011. The follow-up was less of a dance tune than the previous single. \\"South Carolina\\" was a ballad that reached only No. 111 pop in July 1969. In 1970, \\"Keep On Searching\\" was released and did nothing. However, this may have been due to confusion over whether the newest single was \\"Searching\\" or \\"What's Good About Goodbye My Love\\". The latter peaked at No. 17 R&B; in early 1970, but failed to make a dent in the pop charts. In July 1970 the trio scored another hit with another Bickerton and Waddington song, \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\". The song made No. 96 in Cash Box. The same year, Tom Jones also released a version of the song that reached US AC No. 3 and CAN AC No. 5. 1971 saw their sixth and last Deram single, \\"Give Me Love\\" (not the George Harrison song). Not originally in their 1970 LP Sounds Like the Flirtations, but subsequently added to their 2008 CD version, it did not do well in the charts. The rest of their singles were not released in the U.S. Misty Browning, from Texas, replaced Viola Billups in 1972. Viola Billups embarked on a solo career as Vie and as Pearly Gates. Browning was followed by Loretta Noble. During 1972, the group were the resident vocal band on the long running BBC TV series It's Cliff Richard, backing Cliff Richard on various numbers, performing their own songs and supporting other guests on the show. Throughout the 1970s the Flirtations released material on various labels. Polydor titles in 1971 and 1972 included \\"Little Darling (I Need You)\\", \\"Take Me In Your Arms (& Love Me)\\", \\"Hold On To Me Babe\\" and \\"Love A Little Longer\\". In 1973, their Mojo Records releases included \\"Why Didn't I Think of That\\". In 1975 it was RCA's turn: \\"Dirty Work\\", \\"Mr. Universe\\", and \\"One Night of Love\\", which gained enough sales and airplay for another LP, Love Makes the World Go Round, just before 1976. The Flirtations recorded Hi- NRG tracks such as \\"Earthquake\\" (1983), \\"Read All About It\\" (1986) and \\"Back On My Feet Again\\" (1989), the latter reuniting Viola with the Pearce sisters. The track became a major hit in South Africa in 1984 reaching No. 6. The band were rediscovered in the disco and Northern soul circuits of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the U.S.. In the UK \\"Nothing But A Heartache\\" was used in an advertising campaign for KFC and, in 2007, was covered by The Freemasons. Ernestine Pearce can be seen at various venues along with Clem Curtis and Jimmy James as part of \\"The Soul Explosion\\" tour. With Ian Levine forming his label Centre City Records, 2007, the ladies recorded regularly for the label compilations. In 2009, they released their first single in 20 years, \\"Roulette\\", produced by Soren Jensen for Night Dance Records, including mixes and a music video. The track peaked at No. 10 in Music Week's Commercial Pop Club Chart by December 2009.

In the Portuguese Colonial Brazil, Portuguese people born in the Iberian Peninsula were known as reinóis, while Portuguese born in Brazil with both parents being reinóis were known as mazombos.

Apart from the distinction of peninsulares from criollos, the castas system distinguished also mestizos of mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry in the Americas, and mixed Spanish and native Filipino (Spanish Filipino), or Chinese in the Philippines, mulatos (of mixed Spanish and black ancestry), indios, zambos (mixed Amerindian and black ancestry) and finally negros. In some places and times, such as during the wars of independence, peninsulares or members of conservative parties were called deprecatively godos (meaning Goths, referring to the \\"Visigoths\\", who had ruled Spain and were considered the origin of Spanish aristocracy) or, in Mexico, gachupines.gachupín in the Diccionario de la lengua española Godos is still used pejoratively in the Canary Islands for the peninsular Spanish, and in Chile for Spaniards. Colonial officials at the highest levels arrived from Spain to fulfill their duty to govern Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. They defended Cádiz's monopoly on trade, upsetting the criollos, who turned to contraband with British and French colonies, especially in areas away from the main ports of call for the Flota de Indias. They worked to preserve centralized imperial power and sometimes acted as agents of patrol.

It is about the size of a domestic cat. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because it is widespread and abundant over most of its range. Characteristics Geoffroy's cat at the Cincinnati Zoo The Geoffroy's cat is about the size of a domestic cat, but has numerous black spots and dark bands on the cheeks, head and neck as well as on the tail and limbs. The background colour of its fur varies from a brownish- yellow coat in the northern part of its range to a more grayish coat in the south. The underbelly hair is cream-coloured or even white. The backs of the ears are black with white spots. Black individuals are common. Its size is about in head and body with a relatively short tail of about . It weighs between , though individuals up to have been reported. Males are usually larger than females, and Geoffroy's cat in the south are larger than those from the north.  Distribution and habitat Geoffroy's Cat The Geoffroy's cat occurs in Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. It inhabits pampas and savanna landscapes in the Gran Chaco from southern Bolivia to the Straits of Magellan. In the Andes it occurs up to altitudes of . It prefers open woodland or scrubland with plenty of cover. It also occurs in grasslands and marshy areas. It seems to be common in central South American regions. In Bolivia, it is the second most common cat after the ocelot.  Ecology and behaviour  The Geoffroy's cat is nocturnal and a solitary hunter that contacts conspecifics only during the mating season. Geoffroy's cats have been observed to stand up on their hind legs to scan the surrounding landscape and use their tail as a support, an unusual behaviour among cats. It is able to climb trees but rarely does, except to leave faeces to scent mark its territory. It is at the top of the food chain in its range and preys primarily on rodents, hares, small lizards, insects, and occasionally frogs and fish. Females maintain home ranges about in size, while males range over up to . =Reproduction= A Geoffroy's cat kitten The breeding season for Geoffroy's cats lasts from October to March. During this time, the female comes into estrus for periods of up to twelve days, between three and five weeks apart. Mating during this time is brief and frequent, often taking place on a high ledge or similar site. Gestation lasts for 72–78 days. Most births occur between December and May. Litters consist of one to three kittens, and one or two is more common. The kittens are born blind and helpless, weighing about , and develop rather more slowly than in the domestic cat. The eyes open after from eight to nineteen days, and they begin to eat solid food at six or seven weeks. Kittens become independent of their mother at around eight months, but are generally not sexually mature until 18 months for females and 24 months for males. The oldest recorded captive Geoffroy's cat was at least 20 years old. Taxonomy At Dudley Zoo, England Geoffroy's cat is named after the 19th century French zoologist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844). It was identified as Felis geoffroyi in 1844 by French naturalists Alcide d'Orbigny and P. Gervais on the basis of three specimens that d'Orbigny had collected on the banks of the Rio Negro in Patagonia during his travels in South America between 1826 and 1833. Five subspecies have been described based on geographic dispersement: *L. g. geoffroyi: Central Argentina *L. g. euxantha: Northern Argentina, Western Bolivia *L. g. leucobapta: Patagonia *L. g. paraguae: Paraguay, Southeastern Brazil, Uruguay, Northern Argentina *L. g. salinarum: Northwestern and Central Argentina Since 2017, Geoffroy's cat is considered a monotypic species. Genetic studies have shown that Geoffroy's cat is most closely related to the kodkod. Conservation From the 1960s to the 1980s, Geoffroy's cats were hunted extensively for their pelts for the international fur trade, but little trade took place after 1988 and the species was upgraded to CITES Appendix I status in 1992. Legislation introduced in the late 1980s made hunting and domestic trade of their pelts illegal in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. International trade in Cites Appendix I listed species is now prohibited, except for non-commercial purposes.

The dock covers an area of and provides access to the Great Float from the River Mersey. History 1909 map of the Alfred Dock, showing the original lock entrances and passages. In 1856, J. B. Hartley produced plans for alternative river access to the Great Float, as the Great Low Water Basin proved to be insufficient. Completed in 1866, the dock was named after Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, second son of Queen Victoria, and opened by him on 21 June 1866. Designed to replace the Great Low Water Basin, the dock was originally constructed with three lock entrances from the river of , and , and three passages onwards to the Great Float. This provided much expanded access to the Birkenhead dock system, which was also served by an entrance channel further south via Morpeth Dock. In order to accommodate larger vessels, the and lock entrances and passages were combined into an system and deepened, between 1926-9. This meant the removal of a river lock entrance and an access channel to the Great Float, in order to reconstruct the remaining facilities. At the same time, a bascule bridge and a swing bridge were constructed over two remaining passages. The dock was arranged so that the whole dock could be used as a lock. By the beginning of the 1980s, the remaining southern lock entrance had closed and was partly filled in. The redevelopment of Tower Road over a decade later precipitated in the removal of the swing bridge and the sealing up of the southern passage. The north quayside of Alfred Dock was an open quay. The southern quayside was unallocated. Present Of the existing two river entrances, only the north locks remain operational. Tower Road, which links Birkenhead with the Seacombe area of Wallasey, divides Alfred Dock from the Great Float via a bascule bridge. This bridge is the last remaining of the former Four Bridges which crossed the dock system at this point.

In 1912, it called a National Dock Strike in support of London dockers which was observed only in a few centres, and which ended within a week. This was regarded as an embarrassing setback, and led the Federation to adopt a more cautious approach in subsequent years. In 1921 it was criticised for failing to bring out its members in support of the miners in the Black Friday crisis. The NTWF laid the foundations for the creation of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) in 1922. The TGWU initially affiliated, but left in 1923, and the federation accomplished little thereafter, dissolving in 1927.University of Warwick, \\"National Transport Workers' Federation, 1911-1927\\" Affiliates In 1918, the federation's affiliates were: * Amalgamated Association of Carters and Motormen * Amalgamated Association of Tramway and Vehicle Workers * Amalgamated Carters', Lurrymen's and Motormen's Union * Amalgamated Protective Union of Engine Drivers, Crane Drivers, Hydraulic and Boiler Attendants * Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen * Amalgamated Stevedores' Labour Protection League * Cardiff, Penarth and Barry Coal Trimmers' Union * Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers' Union * Glasgow Ship Riggers' Protective Association * Hull Seamen's Union * Labour Protection League * London and Provincial Union of Licensed Vehicle Workers * Liverpool and District Carters' and Motormen's Union * Mersey River and Canal Watermen's Association * National Amalgamated Labourers' Union * National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers * National Amalgamated Union of Labour * National Seamen's and Firemen's Union * National Union of Dock Labourers * National Union of General Workers * National Union of Ship's Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers * National Union of Vehicle Workers * National Warehouse and General Workers' Union * Northwich Amalgamated Society of Salt Workers, Rock Salt Miners, Alkali Workers, Mechanics and General Labourers * Scottish Horse and Motormen's Association * Scottish Union of Dock Labourers * United Carters' and Motormen's Association * United Order of General Labourers * United Society of Boiler Scalers * Weaver Watermen's Association Leadership =Presidents= :1910: Harry Gosling :1924: =Secretaries= :1910: James Anderson :1912: Robert Williams :1925: Frederick James Maynard References Category:Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom Category:1910 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Trade unions established in 1910 Category:Transport and General Workers' Union Category:1927 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct transport organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"National Transport Workers' Federation"},{"id":"1146683","text":"The history of Jewish education in the United States before the 20th century is as old as the United States itself; it is a part of overall U.S. Jewish history. That history begins early in the history of the first Jewish congregation in New York. Attached to that congregation was a school in which secular as well as Hebrew subjects were taught. It was one of the earliest general schools in America; poor children received tuition-free instruction. Religious instruction was established in connection with most of the early synagogues. For ordinary secular education American Jews resorted, in large measure, to the nonsectarian schools and colleges. There was a Jewish matriculate at the University of Pennsylvania, for instance, as early as 1772. The older communities, however, before the general establishment of the public school system, frequently provided regular instruction in secular subjects. These schools ordinarily were adjuncts of the religious schools maintained by the congregations. In Philadelphia as early as 1838 a general Sunday school, without congregational affiliation, was established, largely through the efforts of Rebecca Gratz, who was its superintendent and president until 1864. This was the beginning of a movement, which has spread throughout the country, for the organization of educational work along lines quite independent of congregational activities. Free Schools A similar school was organized in Charleston, South Carolina in the same year; in the following year, one in Richmond, Virginia; in 1845 this movement spread to New York, being taken up first by the Emanu-El Society, although the Shearith Israel congregation had started a Hebrew-school system as early as 1808. In 1848 the Hebrew Education Society was founded at Philadelphia--originally a school for general instruction in the ordinary branches up to and through the grammar-school grade, together with instruction in Hebrew and in the Jewish religion. In 1864 the Hebrew Free School Association was incorporated in New York; and throughout various states of the Union a movement gradually spread for the organization of free religious schools which would bring into a common-school system children from the various congregations in each city. These were largely intended to supersede the private institutions that had hitherto existed. They were, in the main, carried on by volunteer teachers; and their distinguishing feature was that the instruction was usually conducted by native-born persons and in the English language, as against the German teaching in the congregational schools. Technical Schools The whole trend of this educational work was toward the unification of the community and the broadening of the interests of the individual members, with a tendency to overcome the narrowness of the congregational life that had prevailed, wherein Religious schools and Sabbath-schools have been organized in connection with individual congregations. Particular stress is laid upon them by the congregations, which derive from them much of their communal strength. While many of the Hebrew education societies and schools continue in existence, they do not develop or flourish as might be expected; in fact, since 1882 they have largely taken upon themselves an entirely new function. With the sudden arrival in the United States of a large number of Russian Jews having no knowledge of the English language, and in many cases without any particular handicraft, there devolved upon the American Jewish community the necessity of providing *day- and night-schools for teaching English to the new arrivals, and *manual-training and technical schools. These have been established in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and other cities, more or less with the aid of the Baron de Hirsch Fund. The most noteworthy of these educational institutions called into existence since the Russian immigration began is the Educational Alliance of New York. Theological Institutions Until recently provision for higher education on specifically Jewish lines was not found practicable, though as early as 1840 the versatile and suggestive Mordecai M. Noah urged the formation of a Jewish college in the United States. His project met with no response. Nor was I. M. Wise more successful when in 1855 he endeavored to establish a theological college in Cincinnati under the name of \\"Zion Collegiate Institute.\\" In 1867 the scholarly and enterprising Isaac Leeser, however, established Maimonides College at Philadelphia. It was intended that general collegiate instruction should be provided there, though naturally the Jewish branches were to be given particular attention. A certain measure of cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania was planned, and the idea held in mind was that the college should serve as the capstone to the scheme of education built by the Hebrew Education Society. The college was, however, much ahead of the times, and after a few years of languishing life passed out of existence. Not until nearly twenty years thereafter was the first institution for the training of rabbis and teachers founded. This was the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati, established in 1875 by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, an organization created at that time for the purpose, and mainly at the instance of I. M. Wise. The existence of the college has been continuous, and, though theoretically without partizan bias, it is practically the representative of the Reform wing in America. Graduates from this institution are to be found in charge of congregations in nearly every city of importance in the country. Rev. Dr. K. Kohler is president (1905), and there is a faculty of ten professors and several instructors. In 1886 there was established in New York the Jewish Theological Seminary, also for the training of rabbis and teachers, and representing the Orthodox wing of the community. The reorganization which this institution underwent in 1901-2 resulted in the calling of Dr. S. Schechter to its presidency. At the same time it was richly endowed, and in 1903 took possession of a new building, the gift of Jacob H. Schiff. Its library, largely the gift of Judge Mayer Sulzberger, contains one of the greatest collections of Hebraica. In 1895, through a trust vested by Hyman Gratz of the Congregation Mikveh Israel , Gratz College was founded in Philadelphia, which is devoted to the preparation of teachers for Jewish schools. The first President of Gratz College is the famous Jewish educator, Moses Aaron Dropsie. The largest sum ever made available for the promotion of Semitic investigation is that bequeathed in 1905 by Moses A. Dropsie of Philadelphia for the establishment of a Jewish college along broad lines, for instruction \\"in the Hebrew and cognate languages and their respective literatures, and in the rabbinical learning and literature.\\" The amount of this bequest is about $800,000. Throughout the United States there have been established in connection with the various congregations, and also independently, Young Men's Hebrew Associations (YMHA) and other societies which are to a certain extent educational in their character. They usually maintain small libraries and provide lecture-courses on secular and religious topics. In 1893 there was founded the Jewish Chautauqua Society, which has branches all over the country and bears the same relation to the regular schools and colleges as does the University Extension movement, as interpreted in America, to regular colleges for university work. The Council of Jewish Women has engaged to a considerable extent in educational work among its own members. In 1886 the Reform wing of American Jewry organized at Cincinnati a Hebrew Sabbath-School Union for the purpose of promoting uniformity and approved methods in Sabbath-school instruction. As of 1900, there were in the United States 415 Jewish educational organizations, 291 of which were religious schools attached to congregations, with 1,127 teachers and an attendance of about 25,000 pupils. There were also 27 Jewish free schools, chiefly in large cities, with about 11,000 pupils and 142 teachers.

Early individual arrivals =Elias Legarde= Elias Legarde (or Legardo) was a Jew who arrived at Jamestown, Virginia on HMS Abigail in 1621. =Solomon Franco= The fourth Jew known to have lived in northern North America was Solomon Franco, a Sephardic Jew from Holland who is believed to have settled in the city of Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1649. Franco was a scholar and agent for Immanuel Perada, a Dutch merchant. He delivered supplies to Edward Gibbons, a major general in the Massachusetts militia. After a dispute over who should pay Franco (Gibbons or Perada) the Massachusetts General Court ruled on May 6, 1649, that Franco was to be expelled from the colony, and granted him \\"six shillings per week out of the Treasury for ten weeks, for sustenance, till he can get his passage to Holland.\\" =Solomon Pietersen= Solomon Pietersen was a merchant from Amsterdam who came to town in 1654. In 1656, Pietersen became the first known American Jew to intermarry with a Christian; though there are no records showing Pietersen formally converted, his daughter Anna was baptized in childhood. =Jacob Barsimson= On July 8, 1654, Jacob Barsimson left Holland and arrived aboard Peartree on August 22 in the port of New Amsterdam (in Lower Manhattan, where Wall Street is today). Barsimson was employed by the Dutch East India Company and had fled the Portuguese settlements in the New World, who had captured a formerly Dutch settlement and established the Portuguese Inquisition there. =Asser Levy= Asser Levy (Van Swellem) is first mentioned in public records in New Amsterdam in 1654 in connection with the group of 23 Jews who arrived as refugees from Brazil. It is likely he preceded their arrival. Levy was the (kosher) butcher for the small Jewish community. He fought for Jewish rights in the Dutch colony and is famous for having secured the right of Jews to be admitted as Burghers and to serve guard duty for the colony. Dutch Brazilian Sephardi group The first group of Jews in the northern colonies disembarked in early September 1654, shortly after Barsimson. Barsimson is said to have met them at The Battery upon their arrival. This group was made up of twenty-three Portuguese Jews from the Netherlands (four couples, two widows, and thirteen children). Like Barsimson, they had fled from a former Dutch settlement; the group had emigrated from Dutch Brazil after the settlement was conquered by the Portuguese. Fearing the Inquisition, the Jews left Recife. They originally docked in Spanish Jamaica and Spanish Cuba, but the Spanish did not allow them to remain there. Their ship, Ste. Catherine, went to New Amsterdam instead, settling against the wishes of local merchants and the local Dutch Reformed Church. Colonial governor Peter Stuyvesant, upon complaint from these groups, attempted to have the Jews expelled. He wrote a letter to the directors of the Dutch West India Company dated September 22, 1654: > The Jews who have arrived would nearly all like to remain here, but learning > that they (with their customary usury and deceitful trading with the > Christians) were very repugnant to the inferior magistrates, as also to the > people having the most affection for you; the Deaconry also fearing that > owing to their present indigence they might become a charge in the coming > winter, we have, for the benefit of this weak and newly developing place and > the land in general, deemed it useful to require them in a friendly way to > depart, praying also most seriously in this connection, for ourselves as > also for the general community of your worships, that the deceitful race-- > such hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ--be not allowed > to further infect and trouble this new colony to the detraction of your > worships and the dissatisfaction of your worships' most affectionate > subjects. However, among the directors of the Dutch West India Company included several influential Jews, who interceded on the refugees' behalf. Company officials rebuffed Stuyvesant and ordered him in a letter dated April 26, 1655, to let the Jews remain in New Amsterdam, \\"provided the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to the community, but be supported by their own nation\\": > We would have liked to effectuate and fulfill your wishes and request that > the new territories should no more be allowed to be infected by people of > the Jewish nation, for we foresee therefrom the same difficulties which you > fear, but after having further weighed and considered the matter, we observe > that this would be somewhat unreasonable and unfair, especially because of > the considerable loss sustained by this nation, with others, in the taking > of Brazil, as also because of the large amount of capital which they still > have invested in the shares of this company. Therefore after many > deliberations we have finally decided and resolved to apostille [annotate] > upon a certain petition presented by said Portuguese Jews that these people > may travel and trade to and in New Netherland and live and remain there, > provided the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to > the community, but be supported by their own nation. You will now govern > yourself accordingly. Upon the capture of the colony by the English in 1664, the rights enjoyed by the Jews were not interfered with, and for twenty years they appear to have lived much as before the British occupation, though with slight increase in their numbers. Jews had previously been barred from settling in English colonies, as they had been banned from all English lands for 400 years. Oliver Cromwell (British Protector from 1649 through 1660, through his son Richard) lifted this prohibition, and founding of the first major Jewish settlement soon followed in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1672, Rabba Couty attained prominence by his appeal to the King's Council in England from a decree passed against him by the courts of Jamaica, as a result of which one of his ships had been seized and declared forfeited. His appeal was successful and established the rights of Jews as British subjects. This appears to be the first case in which a colonial grant of naturalization was recognized as valid. New York In 1685, the application of Saul Brown (originally Saul Pardo) to trade at retail was denied, as was also that of the Jews for liberty to exercise their religion publicly. That they did so privately in some definite place of worship would appear from the fact that a map of New York, dated 1695, shows the location of a Jewish synagogue on Beaver Street, also that Saul Brown was the minister, and that the congregation comprised twenty families. Five years later the site of the synagogue was so well known that in a conveyance of property the premises were referred to as a landmark. In 1710, the minister of the congregation, Abraham de Lucena, was granted exemption from civil and military service by reason of his ministerial functions, and reference is made to the enjoyment of the same privileges by his predecessors. The minutes of the Congregation Shearith Israel of New York begin in 1729, when it was located in Mill Street, and refer to records dating back as far as 1706. This congregation established on Mill Street, in 1730, on a lot purchased two years before, the first synagogue in the future United States. It would thus appear that the religious rights of these early Jewish settlers had been secured in the beginning of the 18th century, and that they enjoyed also many political rights. An act passed by the General Assembly of New York on November 15, 1727, provided that when the oath of abjuration was to be taken by any British subject professing the Jewish religion, the words \\"upon the true faith of a Christian\\" might be omitted. Three days later an act was passed naturalizing one Daniel Nunes da Costa. A bitter political controversy of 1737 resulted in the decision by the General Assembly that Jews should not be allowed to vote for members of that body. In 1740, Parliament passed the Plantation Act specifically permitting Jews to be naturalized in the colonies. Previous to this date, however, the New York Colonial Assembly had passed numerous special acts of naturalization, some of which were applicable to individuals only; others, more general in character, under which Jews could be naturalized without taking oath \\"upon the true faith of a Christian,\\" were also put upon the statute-book. Between this time and the Revolutionary War the Jewish community in this colony increased by slow stages, the principal immigrants coming from Spain, Portugal, and the West Indies. During the French and Indian War, Jacob Franks was the royal agent, in association with a British syndicate, for provisioning the British forces in America; his dealings with the crown during this period exceeded £750,000 in value. Upstate New York settlement Although most of the earlier immigrants settled in New York City, a few settled beyond its limits, some even as far as the confines of what now constitutes the state of Pennsylvania. In 1661, when Albany was but a trading-post, Asser Levy owned real estate there, but between that date and the early years of the nineteenth century there are no records of any settlers in that town. They were not there in sufficient numbers to form a congregation until 1838, and they had no rabbi until 1846. In New England A group of Jews settled in Newport, Rhode Island in the late 1600s due to the official religious tolerance of the colony as established by Roger Williams. In other parts of New England there were probably occasional settlers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but the intolerance of the Puritans rendered impossible the establishment of any religious communities. According to several sources, Moses Simonson, who settled in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621, may have had Dutch Jewish ancestry.Arthur Hertzberg, The Jews in America: Four Centuries of an Uneasy Encounter : a History (1997), pg. 22 https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0231108419American Jewish Historical Quarterly, Volume 1, pg 107 https://books.google.com/books?id=B6UyAQAAMAAJ (1893) An interesting personality is that of Judah Monis, who became a convert to Christianity and filled the chair of Hebrew in Harvard College from 1722 until his death in 1764. Mention is found of a Jew in Connecticut on November 9, 1659, and of another in 1670. The first Jewish family to settle in New Haven came in 1772, though a few individuals who had become converts to Christianity dwelt there a few years before. The first congregation was established about 1840, the congregants being members of about twenty Bavarian families. From that date on the community increased by slow stages. There are Jewish settlements also in Bridgeport, Ansonia, Derby, Waterbury, New London, and Hartford. The first congregation in Hartford was established in 1843. Since 1891, a number of Jewish farmers have been settled in various parts of the state. The earliest mention of a Jew in Massachusetts bears the date May 3, 1649, and there are references to Jews among the inhabitants of Boston in 1695 and 1702; but they can be regarded only as stragglers, as no settlers made their homes in Massachusetts until the Revolutionary War drove the Jews from Newport. In 1777, Aaron Lopez and Jacob Rivera, with fifty-nine others, went from Newport to Leicester, and established themselves there; but this settlement did not survive the close of the war. A number of Jews, including the Hays family, settled at Boston before 1800. Of these Moses Michael Hays was the most important. In 1830, a number of Algerian Jews went to Boston, but they soon disappeared. The history of the present community begins with 1840, when the first congregation was established. The Jewish immigrants to Vermont and New Hampshire have never been very numerous, though there are congregations in Burlington, Vermont and in Manchester, Nashua, Concord, Portsmouth, and Dover, New Hampshire. Little of importance can be said about the communal life of the Jews in New England, and their numbers increased but slowly until after the beginning of the great Russian emigration in 1882, when the overflow from New York as well as the emigration through Canada commenced to stream into New England. The opening up of the West and the resulting unprofitable nature of farming in New England drew away from this part of the United States many thrifty farmers, who abandoned their unfruitful fields for the more attractive opportunities in the western states. Of interest in connection with this shifting of the population is the fact that many of these abandoned farms, especially in Connecticut, have been taken up by Russian Jews, who, principally as dairy farmers, have added a new and useful element to the agricultural community. Maryland It would seem that only a few Jews found their way to Maryland during the first half of the 17th century, and that the first settlers of this colony came as individuals, and not in considerable numbers at any time, as was the case in New York, Newport, Savannah, and Charleston. To judge by the names alone it would appear that a few Jews were resident in Maryland from the earliest days of the colony. The most prominent figure, who was unquestionably a Jew, was a Dr. Jacob Lumbrozo, who had arrived January 24, 1656, and who, in 1658, was tried for blasphemy, but was released by reason of the general amnesty granted in honor of the accession of Richard Cromwell (March 3, 1658). Letters of denization were issued to Lumbrozo September 10, 1663. Besides practising medicine, he also owned a plantation, engaged in trade with the Native Americans, and had active intercourse with London merchants. He was one of the earliest medical practitioners in the colony, and his career casts much light upon the history and nature of religious tolerance in Maryland. By the strength of his personality he was able to disregard nearly all the laws which would have rendered his residence in the colony impossible, and he seems to have observed his faith even though this, under the laws, was forbidden. The unfavorable environment rendered the admittance of Jews to Maryland difficult, and until the Constitution of 1776 established the religious rights of all, few Jews settled in the colony. Pennsylvania It is on record that Jews from New Amsterdam traded along the Delaware River as early as 1655. There were probably some settlers in the southeastern portion of the territory of which William Penn took possession in 1681. A very considerable number of the early Pennsylvania colonists were German Jews. The first Jewish resident of Philadelphia was Jonas Aaron, who was living there in 1703. Another early pioneer and one of considerable prominence was Isaac Miranda. He was the first to settle at Lancaster, at which place, as also at Shaefferstown, there was an early Jewish immigration. Miranda became a convert to Christianity and held several state offices. A number of Jews settled in Philadelphia in the first half of the eighteenth century, and became prominent in the life of the city. Among these were David Franks, Joseph Marks, and Sampson Levy. The Non- Importation Resolutions of 1765 contained the signatures of eight Jews, an indication of the importance of the Jewish community at this time. As early as 1747 a number of persons held religious services in a small house in Sterling alley, and afterward in Cherry alley--between Third and Fourth streets. They were mostly German and Polish Jews; and their differences as to the liturgy to be followed prevented, at the time, the formation of any regular congregation. Attempts, indeed, were made in 1761 and 1773 to form one, but none was established until the influx of Jews from New York during the Revolutionary War, with the arrival of Gershom Mendes Seixas, gave the community sufficient strength to carry out this cherished object. A lot was purchased and a synagogue erected, the dedication occurring in September 1782. A number of Philadelphia Jews served in the army of the Revolution; and the inestimable services rendered by Haym Salomon to Robert Morris in the finances of the Revolution make his name stand out as the most prominent character in American Jewry. Jews have lived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, since at least 1730, before the town and county were organized. Joseph Simon was the best known of the first arrivals. Meyer Hart and Michael Hart were among the earlier settlers at Easton, where they arrived previous to the Revolutionary War. A synagogue was established there in 1839. Shaefferstown had a few Jewish settlers at an early date, and a synagogue and cemetery in 1732. For a considerable number of years preceding the Revolutionary War a number of Jews of Pennsylvania were engaged in the exploitation and sale of western Pennsylvania lands. Among the more prominent of these were Jacob and David Franks, Barnard and Michael Gratz, Joseph Simon, and Levy Andrew Levy. The American South The Jewish settlement in Georgia dates almost from the very foundation of the colony; and the early history of Georgia is practically the history of the growth and development of Savannah, Jewish life centering in that city. It would appear that a movement was set on foot in London to settle some Jews in the colony even before James Oglethorpe, in June, 1733, led his first band of followers to the point which soon after became the city of Savannah. The second vessel which reached the colony from England (on July 11, 1733) had among its passengers no less than forty Jewish emigrants. Although their arrival was unexpected, the liberal-minded governor welcomed them gladly, notwithstanding that he was aware that the trustees of the colony in England had expressed some opposition to permitting Jews to settle there. These first settlers were all of Spanish, Portuguese, and Prussian extraction, though within a year of their arrival others, who were apparently German Jews, also took up their residence there. These two bands of settlers received equally liberal treatment from Oglethorpe, and were the progenitors of one of the most important communities of Jews in the U.S. Many of their descendants are still living in various parts of the country. The first male white child born in the colony was a Jew, Philip (Uri) Minis on July 11, 1734. Among the first immigrants was Dr. Nunis, who was made welcome because of his medical knowledge, and because he, with a number of others, brought sufficient wealth to the colony to enable the immigrants to take up large tracts of land. A congregation was organized as early as 1734. Three years later Abraham de Lyon, who had been a vigneron in Portugal, introduced the culture of grapes. The cultivation and manufacture of silk and the pursuit of agriculture and of commerce were the chief occupations of these early settlers. A dispute with the trustees of the colony respecting the introduction of slaves caused an extensive emigration to South Carolina in 1741, and resulted in the dissolution of the congregation. But in 1751 a number of Jews returned to Georgia, and in the same year the trustees sent over Joseph Ottolenghi to superintend the somewhat extensive silk-industry in the colony. Ottolenghi soon attained prominence in the political life of his associates, and was elected a member of the Assembly in 1761 and in succeeding years. There seems to have been little if any distinction made socially between the Jews and the other settlers, and educational and philanthropic institutions seem to have been supported by all alike. The liberal charter which John Locke drew up in 1669 for the governance of the Carolinas should have operated to attract Jews there at an early date, since \\"Jews, heathen, and dissenters\\" were by the terms of Locke's charter granted full liberty of conscience. Although political changes modified Locke's original plans considerably, the spirit of tolerance was always retained. Nevertheless, no Jews in any numbers appear to have come to South Carolina until the exodus from Georgia from 1740 to 1771, already referred to. However, one Simon Valentine, one of four Jews who applied for citizenship in 1697, became the first documented Jewish landowner, which entitled him to vote.\\"A \\"portion of the People\\"\\", Nell Porter Brown, Harvard Magazine, January–February, 2003 A few others followed him, for in 1703 a protest was raised against \\"Jew strangers\\" voting in an election for members of the Assembly. In 1748, some prominent London Jews set on foot a scheme for the acquisition of a tract of (809 km²) of land in South Carolina. Nothing came of this, however, though on November 27, 1755, Joseph Salvador purchased (405 km²) of land near Fort Ninety-six for £2,000. Twenty years later Salvador sold (243 km²) of land for £3,000 to thirteen London Sephardic Jews. This land was known as the \\"Jews' Lands.\\" Another of the Salvadors (Francis Salvador, the nephew of Joseph) purchased extensive tracts of land in the same vicinity in 1773–74. Moses Lindo, likewise a London Jew, who arrived in 1756, became actively engaged in indigo manufacture, spending large sums in its development, and making this one of the principal industries of the state. During the Revolutionary War the Jews of South Carolina were to be found on both sides; and the most eminent of the revolutionists was Francis Salvador, who was elected a member of the First and Second Provincial Congresses which met 1775–76, the most important political office held by any Jew during the Revolution. Two-thirds of a company of militia commanded by Richard Lushington was made up of Charleston Jews. After the fall of Charleston in 1780 the majority of Jews left that city, but most of them returned at the close of the war. The Sephardic Jews established a congregation in 1750, and the Jews of German descent another shortly thereafter. In 1791, when the Sephardic congregation was incorporated, the total number of Jews in Charleston is estimated to have been 400. To judge by names alone, it would appear that a few Jews wandered into Virginia as early as 1624. A small number seem also to have been there before the end of the seventeenth century, but for nearly 100 years no traces of Jewish settlement are found. At least one Jewish soldier-- possibly two--served in Virginia regiments under Washington in his expedition across the Allegheny Mountains in 1754. It is probable that Jews drifted into the colony from Baltimore and other points in Maryland at an early date. By 1785, Richmond had a Jewish community of about a dozen families of Spanish- Portuguese descent, which organized a Sephardic congregation in 1791. This congregation remained in existence until 1898. A few Jews were among the traders who settled in Tennessee, near the Holston River, in 1778, but they were mere stragglers and made no permanent settlement. Of the remaining states of the southern group east of the Mississippi River the principal Jewish settlements have been made in Alabama and Mississippi. An occasional Jew made his way into the territory which is now Alabama during the early part of the eighteenth century. One Pallachio became prominent in 1776. It is likely that there were a few Jews in the Natchez district of Mississippi before the close of the eighteenth century, but no congregation was organized until that of Natchez was established in 1843. In the American Revolution Before and during the American Revolutionary War the Jews had representatives of their people upon both sides of the controversy, though the majority joined the colonial side. On the Non-Importation Agreement of 1769 the names of not less than five Jews are found; this is also the case with respect to other agreements of a similar nature. The outbreak of the Revolutionary War dissolved the congregation in New York; and upon the eve of the British occupancy of the town the majority of the congregation, headed by Gershom Mendes Seixas, took all the belongings of the synagogue and removed to Philadelphia, where they established the first regular congregation, the Mickvé Israel, in 1782. The small number who remained in New York occasionally held services in the synagogue. Most of those that left for Philadelphia returned to New York after the war. Haym Solomon or (Salomon), (1740–1785) was possibly the prime financier of the American side during the American War of Independence against Great Britain. He was born in Prussia and died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although the Jews participated prominently in the events leading up to the Revolution, it would appear that even in the midst of absorbing political discussions they were able, in 1774, to start another congregation. They were not all, however, to be found on the colonial side during the war, for Mordecai Sheftall, Levi Sheftall, Philip Jacob Cohen, Philip Minis, and Sheftall Sheftall were in the first days of the Revolution disqualified by the authorities from holding any office of trust in the province because of the pronounced revolutionary ideas which they advocated. The community was dispersed during the Revolution, but many Jews returned immediately after the close of the war.

Noah rendered his country as consul at Tunis (1813–16) should not be omitted). The persecutions and tortures to which some of the most prominent Jews of Damascus had been subjected were reported to the Department of State at Washington, D.C. by the United States consul at Damascus. Immediate instructions, under date of 14 August 1840, were thereupon issued to John Gliddon, the United States consul at Alexandria, Egypt, by Secretary of State John Forsyth, in which he directed that all good offices and efforts be employed to display the active sympathy of the United States in the attempts that the governments of Europe were making to mitigate the horrors of these persecutions. Three days later David Porter, the United States minister to the Ottoman Empire, was instructed by Forsyth to do everything in his power at the Porte to alleviate the condition of the unfortunates. In both these communications the reasons for the intervention of the United States are based upon sentiments of justice and humanity, no American citizens being involved; in the communication to Minister Porter stress was laid upon the peculiar propriety and right of the intervention of the United States, because its political and civil institutions make no distinction in favor of individuals by reason of race or creed, but treat all with absolute equality. Damascus Affair Though it would appear that this action of the United States was taken without the solicitation of any Jews of the US, measures were already on foot to display the feeling of the Jews at this time. Public meetings were held in August and September 1840, in New York City, Philadelphia, and Richmond, participated in by both Christians and Jews, at which resolutions were passed asking the United States to intervene to procure justice for the accused and the mitigation of their hardships. Among the leaders who were instrumental in calling these meetings were Jacob Ezekiel of Richmond, J. B. Kurscheedt and Theodore J. Seixas of New York, and Isaac Leeser and John Moss of Philadelphia. Considerable correspondence passed between these leaders and the Department of State, in which the humanitarian attitude of the government and the nature of its intervention are fully disclosed.\\"Publ. Am. Jew. Hist. Soc.\\" No. 8, p. 141; No. 9, p. 155; No. 10, p. 119. Ten years later the Jews of the US were concerned in the diplomatic relations with Switzerland. Almost simultaneously the negotiations assumed two phases: (a) respecting the ratification of a treaty in which lurked the possibility that American citizens who were not Christians might be discriminated against, and (b) concerning the actual discrimination in Switzerland against American citizens, on the ground that they belonged to the Jewish faith. Swiss disabilities In November 1850, A. Dudley Mann, the American representative, negotiated a treaty with the Swiss Confederation, which was transmitted to the United States Senate on 13 February 1851, by President Millard Fillmore. At the same time the president sent a message in which he took exception to a part of the first article of the treaty, which specifically provided that Christians alone were to be entitled to the privileges guaranteed. An agitation against the ratification of the treaty was started by the Jews as soon as its existence was learned of, and Daniel Webster, then secretary of state, and Senator Henry Clay at once (February 1851) went on record as opposed to the objectionable clause of the treaty. The principal agents in stirring up the opposition were Isaac Leeser, David Einhorn, J. M. Cardozo of Charleston, South Carolina, and Capt. Jonas Phillips Levy of New York. A movement was set on foot in the US shortly thereafter (1852–53) to procure religious toleration abroad for American citizens generally; this was quite distinct from any movement started by the Jews, but greatly aided the latter. As a result of this combined opposition the Senate declined to ratify the treaty. Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan figured largely in the opposition to it. He corresponded with Rev. Isaac Leeser and Captain Levy respecting it, delivered several notable speeches in the Senate against it in 1854, and presented a petition on April 19, 1854, which had been signed by Jews of the United States at the instance of a committee of New York Jews, of which Alexander J. Kursheedt was chairman. As a result, the treaty was amended by the Senate, and in its amended form was ratified and proclaimed 9 November 1855. But the amendment, though less objectionable in phraseology, retained the same connotation and rendered it possible, under its terms, for the Swiss cantons to discriminate against Jews in the manner they had adopted in 1851. Though unsuccessful in preventing the ratification of the treaty, the agitation against it did not cease. Notwithstanding the treaty was proclaimed at the end of 1855, it would appear that this was not generally known until 1857. Attention was drawn to it by the fact that one A. H. Gootman, an American citizen and a Jew, had received notice in 1856 to leave La Chaux-de- Fonds, in Neuchâtel, where he had transacted business for five years. Public meetings of protest were held during 1857, in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Easton, Pa., Charleston, Baltimore, and elsewhere, and a vigorous opposition was voiced by Isaac M. Wise in his paper, \\"The Israelite\\", by David Einhorn in \\"Sinai\\", and by Isaac Leeser in \\"The Occident\\". A convention of Jews met in Baltimore in October, and a delegation appointed by this convention waited on President James Buchanan in the same month to protest against the treaty and request its abrogation; the president promised to take steps to accede to their request so far as lay in his power. Numerous memorials were also transmitted to the president and the Senate. That this agitation attracted general attention is manifested by the fact that the newspapers throughout the country expressed vigorous opinions against the treaty. Though sporadic efforts to procure an alteration in the treaty and the establishment of the rights not only of American Jews but of the Jews of all nations in Switzerland continued to be made in the United States, the principal scene of negotiations shifted to the former country, and the principal actor was Theodore Fay, the American minister. Beginning in August 1853,(\\"U. S. Ex. Doc.\\" xii. 3) when an American citizen, the same Gootman referred to above, received orders from the authorities of La Chaux-de-Fonds, canton of Neuchâtel, to leave that canton on the ground that he was a Jew, Fay, though at first disinclined to take any very energetic stand, finally became much interested in the subject of Swiss discrimination against Jews and kept up an active agitation until his recall in 1860. He succeeded in procuring permission for Gootman to remain, but only as an act of grace, not by right. The obstacle Fay had to attempt to overcome lay in the nature of the Swiss Confederation, which left to the cantons the regulation of the rights of domicil, the Federal Council having no control over the cantons in this respect. Fay was ably supported in his contentions by the secretaries of state Marcy and Lewis Cass, especially the latter. In the course of his negotiations Fay made an elaborate study of the Jewish question as it affected Switzerland, and in June 1859, transmitted what he called his \\"Israelite Note\\" to the Federal Council. This is an extensive treatise explaining the American contention with much force, and embodying besides a general defense of the Jews. It was translated into German and French, was offered for sale by the Federal Council, received much notice in the Swiss newspapers, and caused the restrictions against Jews to be abolished in several cantons. In 1860 the executive committee of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites, of which Myer S. Isaacs was secretary, took steps to continue the agitation in America. Henry I. Hart, the president of the above- mentioned board, took up the matter with Secretary Seward shortly after he assumed office in 1861, and the secretary issued specific instructions to the new minister to Switzerland, George G. Fogg, to be no less active in his endeavor to establish the rights of American Jews than was his predecessor. The restrictions in the cantons were gradually abolished, and full civil rights were finally guaranteed to all Jews by the new Swiss Constitution of 1874. It may be added, however, that the treaty of 1855 is still in force (1905; \\"Publ. Am. Jew. Hist. Soc.\\" No. 11, pp. 7 et seq.). Serbia and Palestine In 1867 Myer S. Isaacs, on behalf of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites, endeavored unsuccessfully to have the government take some steps to alleviate the condition of the Jews in Serbia. In 1882 Gen. Lew Wallace, United States minister to the Ottoman Empire, moved by the hardships suffered by Russian refugees whom he found starving in the streets of Constantinople, called at the Foreign Office and received a communication from the minister of foreign affairs in which the statement was made that Jews would be made welcome anywhere in the Ottoman Empire, except in Ottoman Palestine. In 1884 he took vigorous action against the threatened expulsion from Jerusalem of sundry naturalized American Jews. In 1887 and 1888 attempts were made by the Ottoman government to limit the sojourn of American Jews in Jerusalem to one month--later extended to three months. This was earnestly opposed by the American minister, Oscar S. Straus, ably supported by Secretary Bayard, who contended that the United States, by reason of its Constitution, could not recognize any distinction between American citizens in respect to their religion. By his exertions Straus successfully halted any steps to expel American citizens who happened to be Jews (\\"U.S. For. Rel.\\" 1887, 1888, 1889). Secretaries Blaine, Gresham, and Hay repeatedly took a similar stand, and it would appear that rights of American citizens who are Jews have been carefully guarded in the Ottoman Empire (\\"U.S. For. Rel.\\" 1894, 1898, 1901). Morocco In 1863 atrocities perpetrated upon the Jews of Morocco led the Board of Delegates to ask the intervention of the United States. Secretary Seward instructed the United States consul at Tangier to use his good offices to further the mission of Sir Moses Montefiore, basing his act on the ground of common humanity. For two years the consul exerted himself to carry out his instructions and met with some slight success. In 1878 the Board of Delegates renewed its endeavors to have the government use its good offices in Morocco, and the consul at Tangier, F. A. Matthews, took earnest steps to alleviate the condition of the Jews whenever the opportunity arose during this and succeeding years. Adolph Sanger, on behalf of the Board of Delegates, in 1880 sent out an agent, L. A. Cohen, to Morocco to report on conditions there. In March 1881, the United States minister at Madrid, Lucius Fairchild, proceeded to Morocco to investigate the condition of the Jews. He made a sympathetic and valuable report to the secretary of state, Blaine, in which he displayed an acute interest in the unfortunate conditions in that country, and did his utmost to alleviate them. Romanian disabilities Romanian conditions, which have so vitally interested the United States, first had attention drawn to them by the Board of Delegates in June 1867, when the good offices of the United States in behalf of the persecuted Jews of Romania were requested. In 1870 B. F. Peixotto of New York was appointed consul-general to Romania, and during the six years that he held office he exerted himself to bring about an improvement in the condition of the Jews. In 1878 John A. Kasson, minister of the United States to Austria, in a despatch to the Department of State proposed as a condition preliminary to the recognition of Romanian independence that the United States join with the European powers in exacting from Romania, at the Congress of Berlin, the recognition of the equal civil, commercial, and religious rights of all classes of her population, as also equal rights and protection under the treaty and under Romanian laws, irrespective of race or religious belief. In opening negotiations with Romania in the following year, the recognition by that country of the rights of sojourn and trade of all classes of Americans irrespective of race or creed was strongly emphasized, as it was by Kasson about the same time with respect to Serbia. The continued persecutions of the Jews of Romania, her violations of the provisions of the Treaty of Berlin, and the greatly increased proportions which the Romanian emigration to the United States assumed in consequence, as also the failure to conclude a naturalization convention between the two countries, because Romania would not recognize the rights of American citizens who were Jews, moved Secretary of State John Hay to address on 11 August 1902, identical instructions to the representatives of the United States in Russia, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Turkey upon the subject of Romania's attitude. In this note he drew attention to the consequences to the United States of the continued persecutions in Romania--namely, the unnatural increase of immigration from that country--and upon this based his right to remonstrate to the signatories to the Treaty of Berlin against the acts of the Romanian government. Further, he sustained the right of the United States to ask the above-mentioned powers to intervene upon the strongest grounds of humanity. Acting upon the forcible instructions, the representatives of the United States presented this note to the government to which each was accredited. But beyond the abolition of the Oath More Judaico (1904) and some slight diminution of the harshness of the persecution, little has been accomplished, and Romania continues (1905) almost unrestrictedly to violate the treaty which established her as an independent nation. In 1905 Congress made provision for an American legation at Bucharest. Russian passports The diplomatic correspondence between Russia and the United States involving Jews is of considerable bulk. It relates for the most part to the failure of Russia to recognize the validity of American passports where Jews are involved, which is the principal cause of difference between the United States and Russia. Russia has constantly violated the provisions of her treaty of 1832 with the United States, which gives to the citizens of the two countries unrestricted rights of sojourn, travel, and protection. Until the persecutions in Russia assumed acute form, beginning with 1880, the correspondence between the two countries was not of importance, though occasional earlier instances of discrimination by Russia against American citizens who were Jews had been vigorously protested against by the United States authorities. For the past twenty-five years the record is one of unceasing effort on the part of the United States to establish the rights of American citizens who are Jews, and of continued declination of Russia to live up to her treaty stipulations. The threatened expulsion from St. Petersburg of an American citizen named Pinkos, in 1880, was the occasion for the presentation of energetic notes of remonstrance by John W. Foster, the American minister to Russia. He acted not alone of his own responsibility, but was the recipient of specific instructions from the secretary of state, William M. Evarts. In the course of one of Evarts' letters of instruction the attitude assumed by the United States was clearly set forth in the following terms: \\"In the view of this government the religion professed by one of its citizens has no relation to that citizen's right to the protection of the United States\\" (\\"Am. Jewish Year Book,\\" 1904-5, p. 287). The first protests of Foster and Evarts, inasmuch as they brought forth no satisfactory replies, were succeeded by others of the same tenor, in one of which Evarts stated \\"that we ask treaty treatment for our aggrieved citizens, not because they are Jews, but because they are Americans\\" (ib. p. 290). All the answers of the Russian Foreign Office are based on the claim that the proscriptive laws against the Jews were in existence prior to the treaty of 1832, that they, therefore, must be assumed under the treaty, and, furthermore, that the Jewish question in Russia was complicated by economic and other difficulties. These views were answered in the able despatch of James Blaine, secretary of state, of July 29, 1881. This despatch covers in considerable detail the whole of the American contention, and is so forcibly put that subsequent consideration of the same subject by the Department of State has been unable to add much to it (\\"For. Rel. U.S.\\" 1881, p. 1030). As continued remonstrances during subsequent years led to no results, in 1893 the Department of State took the stand that it could not acquiesce in the action of Russian consuls in asking the religion of American citizens desiring to travel in Russia before granting a visé to their passports, and refusing Jews. The government regarded this as the \\"assumption of a religious inquisitorial function within our own borders, by a foreign agency, in a manner... repugnant to the national sense.\\" In 1895 this view was forcibly presented to the Russian government by the American minister, Clifton R. Breckenridge, and in July of that year the Department of State took the attitude that a \\"continuance in such a course, after our views have been clearly but considerately made known, may trench upon the just limits of consideration\\" (ib. pp. 295, 297). But in spite of the presentation of the American contention in every possible light and with all possible emphasis, Russia stubbornly refuses to live up to her treaty obligations. In April 1902, at the instance of Henry M. Goldfogle, a member of Congress from New York, the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling upon the secretary of state to inform the House \\"whether American citizens of the Jewish religious faith holding passports issued by this government are barred or excluded from entering the territory of the Empire of Russia,\\" and what action concerning the matter had been taken by the government. A few days later Secretary Hay replied, stating in brief what efforts had been made by the United States for the protection of American citizens in Russia, and added that though \\"begun many years ago... [they] have not been attended with encouraging success\\" (ib. pp. 301, 302). In January 1904, Goldfogle introduced another resolution, requesting the president to resume negotiations with Russia looking to the recognition of the validity of American passports irrespective of the religion of the holder. This resolution gave rise to notable addresses on the part of a number of members of the House, and was passed, in substance, in April of that year (ib. pp. 304, 305). In consequence of this resolution the question of American passports was taken up anew by the Department of State during the summer of 1904. The Russian reply made at that time was to the effect that a commission had been created in 1903 to consider the revision of the passport regulations, and that the desires of the United States would be brought to the attention of that commission. In his annual message, December 1904, President Roosevelt wrote vigorously against the Russian attitude, characterizing it as \\"unjust and irritating toward us.\\" In February 1905, a committee of members of the House of Representatives was formed, with Wachter of Maryland as chairman, to urge further action by the Department of State. As yet nothing significant has been accomplished. =Kishinef petition= The massacres at Kishinef in April 1903, aroused indignation throughout the United States. Though in response to a cable of inquiry sent by Secretary John Hay to Ambassador Robert S. McCormick at St. Petersburg, asking if relief could be sent to the sufferers, the ambassador stated that he was informed officially that there was no distress or want in south-western Russia, nevertheless mass-meetings were held in almost every city of importance, and the comments in the newspapers portrayed the feelings of horror of the American people. A practical turn was given by the collection of considerable sums to alleviate the misery of the unfortunates. In the hope that if the attention of the czar were directly brought to the plight of the Jews in his dominions their condition might be alleviated, the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith took measures to prepare a petition for transmittal to him. On June 15, 1903, a committee of the order waited upon Secretary Hay and President Theodore Roosevelt, and presented a tentative draft of the petition. This having met with their approval, it was then circulated throughout the United States, and over 12,500 signatures of Christians and Jews in all walks of life were appended to it. On July 15 the American representative at St. Petersburg was instructed to ask an audience of the minister of foreign affairs in order to find out whether the petition, which was given in full in the despatch, would be received by the minister to be put before the czar. The minister declined to receive it, and the bound copy with the signatures was placed by Secretary Hay in the archives of the Department of State in October 1903. Though the petition did not reach its destination, its words attained worldwide publicity, and its object was in a measure accomplished in this way (Adler, \\"Voice of America on Kishineff,\\" 1904). Throughout the history of the United States the government has insisted with great force upon the equal treatment of all American citizens in foreign countries, irrespective of race or creed. Further, it never has failed to intercede with foreign governments on humanitarian grounds, whenever the opportunity arose, in behalf of Jews who were being persecuted or of those to whom life was rendered precarious by inhuman proscriptive laws. A considerable number of Jews have held diplomatic posts, among the more prominent being Mordecai M. Noah, consul to Tunis, 1813–16; Edwin de Leon, consul-general to Egypt, 1854; August Belmont, secretary of legation at The Hague, 1853–55, and minister resident, 1855–58; Oscar S. Straus, minister to Turkey, 1887–89, 1897–1900; Solomon Hirsch, minister to Turkey, 1889–92; B. F. Peixotto, consul to Bucharest, 1870–76; Simon Wolf, consul-general to Egypt, 1881; Max Judd, consul-general to Vienna, 1893–97; and Lewis Einstein, third secretary of embassy at Paris, 1903, and London, 1905.

Lambèse. Lerous, Paris 1893 (Original in French) The former bishopric is also a Latin Catholic titular bishopric.  History  Lambaesa was founded by the Roman military. The camp of the third legion (Legio III Augusta), to which it owes its origin, appears to have been established between AD 123-129, in the time of Roman emperor Hadrian, whose address to his soldiers was found inscribed on a pillar in a second camp to the west of the great camp still extant. However, other evidence suggests it was formed during the Punic Wars. By AD 166 mention is made of the decurions of a vicus, 10 curiae of which are known by name; and the vicus became a municipium probably at the time when it was made the capital of the newly founded province of Numidia. Lambaesis was populated mainly by Romanized Berbers and by some Roman colonists with their descendants: Latin was the official and commonly used language (even if local Berbers spoke their own language mixed with Latinisms). III Augusta was disbanded by Gordian III and the legionaries dispersed among the North African provinces. But the legion was restored in the AD 250s by Valerianus and Gallienus and from then on the legion was known as Augusta Restituta. Its final departure did not take place till after AD 392 (the town soon afterwards declined). Roman Lambaesis was located at the centre of Berber Africa (in an AD 200 map) Members of the French Foreign Legion marching through the barracks in 1958 Indeed, under Septimius Severus (AD 193 ), Numidia was separated from Africa Vetus, and governed by an imperial procurator. Under the new organization of the empire by Diocletian, Numidia was divided in two provinces: the north became Numidia Cirtensis, with capital at Cirta, while the south, which included the Aurès Mountains and was threatened by raids, became Numidia Militiana, \\"Military Numidia\\", with capital at the legionary base of Lambaesis. Subsequently however, Emperor Constantine the Great reunited the two provinces in a single one, administered from Cirta, which was now renamed Constantina (modern Constantine, Algeria) in his honour. Its governor was raised to the rank of consularis in AD 320, and the province remained one of the seven provinces of the diocese of Africa until the invasion of the Vandals in AD 428, which began its slow decay, accompanied by desertification. The province remained under Vandal rule, but was effectively limited to the coastal areas by Berber raids. It was restored to Roman rule after the Vandalic War, when it became part of the new praetorian prefecture of Africa. The Byzantines occupied Lambaesis and vicinity from the sixth century but around AD 683 the Arabs conquered the area, naming what remained of the city Bar-el-Molouk in the 10th century.  Ecclesiastical history  Lambaesis was an episcopal see during late Ancient times as part of the Roman province of Numidia. For such an important town, its bishopric is surprisingly absent from the historical record. Lambaesis did not send a representative to the Council of NicaeaHeinrich Gelzer, Patrum Nicaenorum nomina Latine, Graece, Coptice, Syriace, Arabice, Armeniace. (In aedibus B.G. Teubneri, 1995 ). nor ChalcedonRichard Price, Michael Gaddis, The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, Volume 1 (Liverpool University Press, 2005). and is not mentioned by LeQuinn .Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus', Paris 1740, Vol. I.

Aerial view of Lamaesis ruins The ruins are situated on the lower terraces of the Aures Mountains, and consist of triumphal arches (one to Septimius Severus, another to Commodus), temples, aqueducts, vestiges of an amphitheatre, baths and an immense quantity of masonry belonging to private houses. To the north and east lie extensive cemeteries with the stones standing in their original alignments; to the west is a similar area, from which, however, the stones have been largely removed for building the modern village. Of the temple of Aesculapius only one column is standing, though in the middle of the 19th century its façade was entire. The capitol or temple dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, which has been cleared of debris, has a portico with eight columns. On level ground about two-thirds of a mile from the centre of the ancient town stands the camp, its site now partly occupied by the penitentiary and its gardens. It measures by , and in the middle rise the ruins of a building commonly called, but incorrectly, the praetorium. This noble building, which dates from 268, is long by broad and high; its southern façade has a splendid peristyle half the height of the wall, consisting of a front row of massive Ionic columns and an engaged row of Corinthian pilasters. Lambaesis 2005 Behind this building (which was roofed), is a large court giving access to other buildings, one being the arsenal. In it have been found many thousands of projectiles. To the southeast are the remains of the baths. The ruins of both city and camp have yielded many inscriptions (Renier edited 1500, and there are 4185 in CIL viii); and, though a very large proportion are epitaphs of the barest kind, the more important pieces supply an outline of the history of the place. Over 2500 inscriptions relating to the camp have been deciphered. In a museum in the village are objects of antiquity discovered in the vicinity.René Cagnat. Musée de Lambèse. Leroux, Paris 1895 (Original in French) In addition to inscriptions and statues, there are some fine mosaics found in 1905 near the arch of Septimius Severus. The statues include those of Aesculapius and Hygieia, taken from the temple of Aesculapius. About south of Lambessa are the ruins of Markuna, the ancient Verecunda, including two triumphal arches.

Similarly, every smooth m-dimensional manifold can be immersed in the 2m-1-dimensional sphere (this removes the m>1 constraint). The weak version, for 2m+1, is due to transversality (general position, dimension counting): two m-dimensional manifolds in \\\\mathbf{R}^{2m} intersect generically in a 0-dimensional space. Further results William S. Massey went on to prove that every n-dimensional manifold is cobordant to a manifold that immerses in S^{2n-a(n)} where a(n) is the number of 1's that appear in the binary expansion of n. In the same paper, Massey proved that for every n there is manifold (which happens to be a product of real projective spaces) that does not immerse in S^{2n-1-a(n)}. The conjecture that every n-manifold immerses in S^{2n-a(n)} became known as the Immersion Conjecture. This conjecture was eventually solved in the affirmative by Ralph Cohen .

It was built between 1904 and 1908, from land reclaimed during the construction of the Great Float. History The dock was designed by Anthony George Lyster. Construction began in 1905, from the land reclaimed during the construction of the Great Float. During its construction on 6 March 1909, a temporary dam collapsed, killing 14 navvies. This incident is now referred to as the Birkenhead Dock Disaster. The dock was opened in 1909, having warehouses on either side. =The name Vittoria= The dock is named after the Battle of Vittoria, fought on 21 June 1813. An alternative view is that Vittoria Dock has derived its name as a tribute to the first ship to circumnavigate the globe, Magellan's Vittoria. However, Magellan's ship was named after the church of Santa María de la Victoria de Triana, therefore, this Vittoria naming may be questioned. Vittoria Dock is sometimes incorrectly quoted as 'Victoria Dock', thought in reference to Queen Victoria. However, the wharf was originally known as Victoria, and the plans of 1843 include a Victoria Dock on the site. Although, when acquired by the Liverpool Corporation, the site may have been renamed to avoid confusion with Victoria Dock. =In use= Between 1937 and 1941, HMS Conway, a training ship, was based here. Between the 1920s and 1970s, the Vittoria Wharf terminal was operated by Clan Line Steamers Ltd. The southern quayside was operated by Blue Funnel Line Ltd., which loaded two or three ships each week, destined for the Far East. The Brocklebank Line, Houston Line and the Scottish Shire Line also used the dock. The dock was extended west in 1960, and fell into disuse as container shipping came into use. When the Warship Preservation Trust closed in February 2006, most of its exhibits, which included the HMS Plymouth and wooden-hulled minesweeper HMS Bronington, were later moved to Vittoria Dock for safe storage. Future The dock is included in Peel Group's £4.5bn Wirral Waters redevelopment. The Baseline Study of July 2008 has been endorsed by Wirral Borough Council. In February 2009 the initial stage of the planning application for the first major mixed-use development masterplan/quarter was submitted. The development would be expected to take up to 30 years.

It was issued in limited numbers in British Guiana (now Guyana) in 1856, and only one specimen is now known to exist. It is the only major postage stamp ever issued that is not represented in Britain's Royal Philatelic Collection. The details of the stamp may be better seen in this image of the 4-cent stamp of the same issue It is imperforate, printed in black on magenta paper, and it features a sailing ship along with the colony's Latin motto \\"Damus Petimus Que Vicissim\\" (We give and expect in return) in the middle. Four thin lines frame the ship. The stamp's country of issue and value in small black upper case lettering in turn surround the frame. With its US$9,480,000 sale on 17 June 2014 to Stuart Weitzman, this item has broken the world record for a single stamp auction price each of the last four times it has been sold. Background The 1c magenta was part of a series of three definitive stamps issued in 1856 and was intended for use on local newspapers. The other two stamps, a 4c magenta and 4c blue, were intended for letter postage. The issue came about through mischance. An anticipated delivery of stamps by ship did not arrive so the local postmaster, E.T.E. Dalton, authorised printers Joseph Baum and William Dallas, who were the publishers of the Official Gazette newspaper in Georgetown, to print an emergency issue of three stamps. Dalton gave some specifications about the design, but the printer chose to add a ship image of their own design to the stamps. Dalton was not pleased with the end result, and as a safeguard against forgery ordered that all correspondence bearing the stamps be autographed by a post office clerk. This particular stamp was initialled E.D.W. by the clerk E.D. Wight. Description and history Only one copy of the 1c stamp is known to exist. It is in used condition and has been cut in an octagonal shape. A signature, in accordance with Dalton's policy, can be seen on the left-hand side, along with a heavy postmark. It was discovered in 1873 by a 12-year-old Scottish schoolboy, Louis Vernon Vaughan, in the Guyanese county of Demerara (whose postmark the stamp bears), amongst his uncle's letters. There was no record of it in his stamp catalogue, so he sold it some weeks later for six shillings to a local collector, Neil Ross McKinnon. In 1878 McKinnon's collection was sold to a Liverpool stamp dealer, Thomas Ridpath, for £120. Shortly afterwards, in the same year, Thomas Ridpath sold the 1c to Philipp von Ferrary for about £150. His massive stamp collection was willed to a Berlin museum but following Ferrary's death in 1917 the entire collection was taken by France as war reparations following the end of World War I. Members of the Guyana Philatelic Society with T-shirts showing the stamp Arthur Hind bought the stamp during a series of fourteen auctions in 1922 for over $36,000 (reportedly outbidding three kings, including George V); on 6 April 1922, sale 3, lot 295, the stamp sold for 300,000 franc + 17½% tax (@48 frs. to £1 it was £7,343). On 30 October 1935 it was offered for sale at Harmer Rooke & Co auction 2704, lot 26, where a bid of £7,500 was received from Percival Loines Pemberton. However, the lot was withdrawn and returned to Mrs. Scala (formerly Mrs. Hind). In 1940, she offered it for private sale through the philately department of Macy's department store in New York City. It was purchased for $40,000 by Fred \\"Poss\\" Small, an Australian-born engineer from Florida, who had wanted to own the stamp since he first heard about it as a boy. In acquiring it, Small completed a full set of stamps from British Guiana. In 1970, Small auctioned his entire stamp collection (estimated to be worth $750,000), and the 1c stamp was acquired by a syndicate of Pennsylvanian investors, headed by Irwin Weinberg, who paid $280,000 for it and spent much of the decade exhibiting it in a worldwide tour. John E. du Pont bought it for $935,000 in 1980, setting the world's record for a single stamp price again. Subsequently, it was believed to have been locked in a bank vault while its owner was in prison. Du Pont died while still incarcerated on 9 December 2010; 80 percent of the proceeds from the auction went to Bulgarian Valentin Yordanov, a retired Bulgarian wrestler, to whom Du Pont left the majority of his estate. The stamp was sold from the DuPont estate on 17 June 2014 at a Sotheby's New York auction, sale number N09154, for $9,480,000, including buyer's premium. It took only two minutes to sell to an anonymous bidder, and was the fourth time the stamp had broken the world's record for a single-stamp bid; this time, the sale broke the 1996 record of $2,300,000 for the Treskilling Yellow, an 1855 Swedish stamp. The purchaser has since identified himself as shoe designer and businessman Stuart Weitzman, who collected stamps as a child. Controversies At one point, it was suggested that the 1c stamp was merely a \\"doctored\\" copy of the magenta 4c stamp of the same series, a stamp very similar to the 1c stamp in appearance. These claims were disproven. In the 1920s a rumour developed that a second copy of the stamp had been discovered by then-owner, Arthur Hind, who quietly purchased the supposed second copy to subsequently destroy it. The rumour has not been substantiated. In 1999, a second 1c stamp was claimed to have been discovered in Bremen, Germany. The stamp was owned by Peter Winter, who is widely known for producing many forgeries of classic philatelic items, printed as facsimiles on modern paper. The stamp was twice examined and found to be a fake by the Royal Philatelic Society London. In their opinion, this specimen is an altered 4c magenta stamp. Public display The stamp was displayed at the 1939 New York World's Fair, the 1956 Fifth International Philatelic Exhibition (FIPEX) in the New York Coliseum, Australia in 1963, New York's 1964 Centenary International Stamp exhibition (CIPEX), London in 1965, and Toronto's Canadian Philatelic Exhibition (CAPEX) in 1978. In November 2014, the National Postal Museum of the Smithsonian Institution announced that the then-anonymous owner of the stamp had agreed to display it at the museum in Washington, DC, beginning 4 June 2015 and running through 2 December 2018. Next to the Postal Museum exhibit is a copy of a Donald Duck comic book, The Gilded Man, (OS 422) from 1952 whose central plot element revolves around Donald and his nephews, Huey, Louie and Dewey, going to British Guiana to try to find another copy of the stamp. The comic is written and drawn by Carl Barks.Barrier, Michael (1982). Carl Barks and the Art of the Comic Book. M. Lilien. . The stamp was exhibited in the Court of Honor at World Stamp Show-NY 2016 in New York City from 28 May to 3 June 2016.

The play was originally presented (twice) on stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City as part of the New Music America Festival on November 10, 1989. Footage from these performances was used for the home video release. It is also known to have been performed in Canada once, in Montreal. Cast *Nicolas Cage as Heartbreaker *Laura Dern as Heartbroken Woman *Julee Cruise as The Dreamself of the Heartbroken Woman *Michael J. Anderson as Woodsman / Twin A The show The presentation opens with Cage and Dern engaging in a telephone conversation, the gist of which is that he is breaking up with her, to her great sorrow. Though they are never named as such, the two characters bear a striking resemblance to Sailor and Lula from Lynch's movie Wild at Heart. The rest of the play is a hallucinatory \\"dream\\" that the Heartbroken Woman has. The show takes place on a stage, the main props being a tall metal girder-like structure, and an abandoned shell of a car, with flickering lights and cacophonous sounds used to disturbing, nightmarish effect. Much use is made of actors suspended from ropes, flying and falling, as well as dancers. Julee Cruise sings on tracks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10. These songs are all from her 1989 debut album, Floating into the Night, apart from track 1, which is from her 1993 album, Voice of Love. They are the normal, studio recordings - the songs are mimed. Her voice can also be heard in track 6, in which she gets pushed into the boot of the car. In track 8, the boot opens and she sings from it, her face superimposed on a TV-screen. Two of Julee's recordings, \\"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\\" and \\"The World Spins,\\" were also featured in episode 14 of the second season of Twin Peaks (for which Cruise recorded a vocal version of the theme). Another song from this performance, the instrumental \\"I'm Hurt Bad,\\" is played on the diner's jukebox in the Twin Peaks pilot. \\"The World Spins\\" is also performed by Cruise in episode 17 of Twin Peaks: The Return Michael J. Anderson (known for his role as the small, dancing Man From Another Place on Twin Peaks) is featured on track 3, patiently sawing a log of wood to Badalamenti's discordant music. He is also part of the stage ensemble on track 5 (instrumental), along with a tall, demonic reindeer-like figure. Finally, on track 6, he reiterates the opening dialogue between Cage and Dern, accompanied by a clarinet-player and a non-speaking actress playing Dern's part. Track 9 is wholly instrumental, with a background of dolls being lowered from the roof on strings. Track list #Up In Flames #I Float Alone #The Black Sea #Into the Night #I'm Hurt Bad #Pinky's Bubble Egg (The Twins Spoke) #The Dream Conversation #Rockin' Back Inside My Heart #The Final Battle #The World Spins Home media The show was released on VHS in 1990, on LaserDisc in 1991, and on DVD on November 18, 2008 as part of the David Lynch: The Lime Green Set collection, which featured the performance in both full-frame and widescreen versions. The widescreen version has less visual information due to the top and bottom of the footage being cut off so that it fills up the entire screen of a widescreen TV.

He is the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney and the father of actor George Clooney. Early life Nick and sisters Rosemary Clooney and Gail Stone at Rosemary's television program, The Lux Show, in 1957. Gail did not pursue a career in entertainment. Clooney was born in Maysville, Kentucky, the son of Marie Frances (née Guilfoyle; 1904–1972) and Andrew Joseph Clooney (1902–1974). He was one of five children. His father was of Irish and German descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. While serving as a Corporal in the U.S. Army, he was a disc jockey in the American Forces Network in Germany, hosting the shows Music in the Air and Melody-Go- Round. He then moved to California for a try at show business. When that did not work out, Clooney moved to Ohio, where he met Nina Warren when she was a contestant in a beauty pageant he was judging; they married in August 1959. In addition to his son, George, Nick Clooney has a daughter named Adelia (known as Ada). Broadcasting and journalism career Clooney had an eight-year stint (1958-1966) at WKYT-TV in Lexington, Kentucky, then went to Ohio to host his own TV show, The Nick Clooney Show, first in Columbus, Ohio, for WLWC television in 1968, then for Cincinnati's WCPO-TV in 1969, and finally with its greatest degree of success for crosstown rival WKRC-TV through the early 1970s. The Nick Clooney Show was a local morning show, with a variety and talk-show format. In December 1974, he gained his first national fame by hosting the short-lived ABC daytime game show The Money Maze. Broadcast nationally on ABC at 4 p.m., WKRC-TV (at the time an ABC affiliate) delayed The Money Maze so it could be seen back-to-back with The Nick Clooney Show at 10:30 and 11 a.m., respectively. After ABC canceled The Money Maze on July 4, 1975, Clooney returned to WKRC-TV and became the station's news director and lead anchor. As a journalist, he is probably best remembered for his coverage of the 1977 Beverly Hills Supper Club fire and its aftermath, which spanned several years. Many people in the region first heard about the fire from Clooney when WKRC interrupted its Saturday night prime-time schedule to broadcast news of the fire. Clooney pursued a hard news focus that was quite different from the sensationalism often seen on local television. Under his leadership, WKRC-TV became a solid #1 in the local news ratings, dethroning CBS affiliate WCPO-TV, which had controlled ratings for more than two decades under Al Schottelkotte's leadership. After leaving WKRC in 1984, Clooney then worked in Los Angeles, California, as the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. co-anchor at KNBC. He returned again to WKRC-TV in the late 1980s, but by that time, NBC affiliate WLWT was number one in the late newscast, with former Cincinnati mayor Jerry Springer as its main anchor; Clooney was not able to lead WKRC back to ratings leadership it enjoyed in the past. He moved on to Salt Lake City, Utah for several years to host the newly created evening news program on the FOX affiliate KSTU. Then in 1994, a short stint as a news anchor for NBC affiliate WGRZ-TV in Buffalo, New York. He resurfaced nationally in television as a host and researcher for the cable channel American Movie Classics, where he introduced and presented backgrounds of classic movies, along with Bob Dorian. In 1999, he returned to his former radio home WSAI in Cincinnati, starting as afternoon host September 13, then moving to mornings in November to replace Bob Braun, who had health problems.Toby Eddings, \\"Clooney, Kinard and Pensacola, too,\\" The Sun News, January 23, 2000. 2004 Congressional campaign Clooney ran as a Democrat in the 2004 election for a seat in the House of Representatives representing Kentucky's 4th Congressional District. His opponent for the open seat was Republican Geoff Davis. Clooney was recruited to run by Ken Lucas, the outgoing Democratic congressman who had held onto the conservative district with his moderate views. With his name recognition and well-publicized endorsement from Lucas, Clooney was a big favorite to keep the seat in Democratic hands. Early in 2004, Davis fought through a (sometimes rough) three-way Republican primary. Despite a commanding early lead, when the national media began to report on the electoral contest (due to his famous son George Clooney), his Republican opponents began using the phrase \\"Hollywood vs the Heartland\\" to describe the race. Clooney's lead began to disappear and he was dealt a blow when both The Kentucky Enquirer and the Community Press newspapers endorsed Davis. Clooney lost 44% to 54%. During his concession speech, he said his short career in politics was over. He went back to writing a column for The Cincinnati Post three times a week, covering a wide range of topics, until the Post's discontinuation at the end of 2007. Post-Congressional run In 2006, Clooney and his son George travelled to Darfur, Sudan, and filmed a documentary, A Journey to Darfur, which was broadcast on American cable TV as well as in United Kingdom and France. In 2008, it was released on DVD with the proceeds from its sale being donated to the International Rescue Committee to help the people of Darfur.Clooney's Docu on Darfur to Air Monday AmericanLife TV Network (ALN) Donates Proceeds From \\"A Journey to Darfur\\" DVD to the International Rescue Committee \\"In addition to premiering on AmericanLife TV Network, \\"A Journey to Darfur\\" has aired on The Community Channel in England and France 2. The documentary has also been shown at festivals and schools around the world including The second Refugee Film Festival in Tokyo presented by the UNHCR; Ilaria Alpi Journalistic Television Award based in Riccione, Italy; Milano Doc Festival; and the Human Rights Nights Film Festival in Bologna, Italy.\\" Clooney became a strong activist for Darfur. He has done several open forums and speeches at local high schools in Ohio and Kentucky, and has participated in different rallies for Darfur. On March 16, 2007, following a Darfur rally, Clooney was awarded an honorary Class of 1952 diploma from St. Xavier High School, the high school he attended in Cincinnati before moving to California. On October 11, 2007, Clooney visited Turpin High School in Cincinnati to talk to students about Darfur. The University of Kentucky announced that it would present him with an honorary degree at its 2007 commencement. Clooney served as the host of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize awards ceremony in both 2007 and 2008. In fall 2008, Clooney joined the faculty at American University in Washington, D.C. as American University School of Communication and Newseum Distinguished Journalist in Residence. Clooney's appointment is part of a long-term partnership between the School of Communication and the Newseum, the interactive museum of news in Washington, D.C. As part of the school-Newseum partnership, Clooney hosted the fifth annual AU School of Communication- Newseum Reel Journalism Film Festival and other events at the Newseum. \\"After a news career that stretches back to the Eisenhower administration, I'm looking forward to joining American University's School of Communication and the Newseum to work with a new generation of prospective journalists,\\" said Clooney. Clooney taught Opinion Writing in fall 2008, and in spring 2009, he taught Films that Changed Us, a new course based on his book, The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen (Atria, 2002). The book analyzes the significance of such iconic American films as The Birth of a Nation, The Jazz Singer, Dr. Strangelove, Stagecoach, The Graduate, Star Wars and Saving Private Ryan. Clooney was the commencement speaker for the University of Cincinnati on June 8, 2012 and was awarded an honorary degree the following day. In 2014, Nick Clooney appeared in The Monuments Men which was directed by his son, George Clooney, who played one of the leading characters, Stokes. Nick Clooney played the older Stokes visiting Bruges, Belgium, years later to see the Madonna, which was one of the many treasures rescued by the Monuments Men.

Biography Born in New York City in 1902, Kelly was best known as a member of the Ziegfeld Follies and her radio hosting with Columbia Broadcasting. One of her best remembered roles is that of Lt. Ethel Armstrong in the 1943 Paramount wartime drama So Proudly We Hail!. However, she is probably better remembered in the 1935 Our Gang comedy short Beginner's Luck. In this film, Kelly was cast as the pushy stage mother of Spanky McFarland. Thanks to his friends, she finds herself an unwitting victim, as well as a laughingstock, in the gang's attempt to sabotage and ruin Spanky's Shakespearean stage act in a talent competition. After the war, she appeared in many TV series, including Bonanza, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Batman and Perry Mason, from which she made four guest appearances, including the role of Millie Foster in the 1958 episode \\"The Case of the Rolling Bones.\\" Kelly also performed in England. Death Kelly died from cancer on June 29, 1968, in Hollywood, California.

Though once slated for development including the projected route of Crenshaw Boulevard, the area is geologically unstable and is unsuitable for building. The geographical location and geological history of the peninsula make the remaining habitat extremely valuable for ecological and other scientific reasons. The peninsula, which was an island with the Palos Verdes Hills in recent geological time, has close floral and faunal similarities to the Channel Islands. This feature makes the Portuguese Bend Landslide area a natural research laboratory for the study of island biogeography and evolutionary ecology. The vegetation found in the area is coastal sage scrub. This plant community supports a surprising number and variety of species. There are at least three races of birds resident on the peninsula that are found nowhere else except the Channel Islands. These are the insular forms of the orange-crowned warbler, Pacific- slope flycatcher, and Allen's hummingbird. The same phenomenon has been documented for plant species. A species of live-forever, Dudleya virens, which is endemic to the Channel Islands and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, is found near Point Vicente Lighthouse, which was built in 1926. The area also serves as habitat to many migrating birds moving through the region in fall and spring. The Peninsula is a headland that juts into the Pacific Ocean several miles further than the surrounding coastline. Migrating terrestrial and shore birds, flying over the open ocean on their north-south migration along the Pacific Flyway, spot this headland and stop to rest and feed. Many of these birds will stay and spend the winter in the area. Thus, the geographic position makes this habitat much more important than might otherwise be expected. In general, the area has been lightly disturbed, and much natural vegetation remains. Intense disturbances, in the form of heavy off-road vehicle and pedestrian use, have been limited. Grazing also took place at one time. History of inhabitants =Native Americans= The peninsula was the homeland of the Tongva-Gabrieliño Native American people for thousands of years. In other areas of the Los Angeles Basin archeological sites date back 8,000 years.[4][5] Their first contact with Europeans was in 1542 with João Cabrilho (John Cabrillo), the Portuguese explorer who also was the first to write of them. Chowigna and Suangna were two Tongva settlements of many in the peninsula area, which was also a departure point for their rancherias on the Channel Islands. Legend has it that the Native Americans blessed the land of Palos Verdes, making it the most beautiful place on Earth. =Spanish and Mexican era= In 1846 Jose Dolores Sepulveda and José Loreto received a Mexican land grant from Alta California Governor Pío Pico for a parcel from the huge original 1784 Spanish land grant Rancho San Pedro of Manuel Dominguez.[6] It was named Rancho de los Palos Verdes, or \\"ranch of the green sticks\\", which was used primarily as a cattle ranch.[7] =American era= By 1882 ownership of the land had passed from the Sepulveda through various mortgage holders to Jotham Bixby of Rancho Los Cerritos, who leased the land to Japanese farmers. Early in the 20th century most of Bixby's land was sold to a consortium of New York investors who created The Palos Verdes Project and began marketing land on the peninsula for small horse ranches and residential communities. =The whaling era= The name Portuguese Bend comes from the whaling activities of Portuguese whalemen from the Azores. An Azorean shore whaling captain named José Machado brought shore whaling to this bend in the coastline north of San Pedro Bay after the closure of the San Pedro Bay whaling station on Deadman's Island in or about 1862. He brought with him a crew of Azorean whalemen. In 1864, Captain Clark moved his operations to San Simeon Bay. In 1869, the station was operated by the John Brown Whaling Company (Los Angeles Star, March 13, 1869).Jones, Mary Lou, Steven L. Swartz, and Stephen Leatherwood. 1984. The Gray whale: Eschrichtius robustus. Orlando, Fla: Academic Press. In 1874, Captain Frank Anderson (né Anasio) brought a crew from Port Harford in San Luis Obispo County. His operation at Portuguese Bend lasted from 1874 to 1877. During three winters (December–April) he obtained 2,166 barrels of oil from trying out the blubber flensed from gray whales he had caught on their annual migration along the California coast. He abandoned the station thereafter, establishing another further north at Pigeon Point.Clark, A.H. 1887. History and present condition of the fishery. Pages 3-218 in G.B. Goode, ed. The fisheries and fishery industries of the United States. U. S Government Printing Office, Washington, DC. An 1888 U.S. Fish Commission Report stated that whales had been caught from Portuguese Bend as late as 1884, suggesting another party utilized the area for whaling up until that date. Bertao, David. The Portuguese Shore Whalers of California 1854-1904. [San Jose, CA: Portuguese Heritage Publications, 2006]. See pp. 155-157.The Old Whaling Station there was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.381) on Jan. 3, 1944. Cal, Parks Marker, 381, Old Whaling Station =The Vanderlip era= Frank A. Vanderlip, Sr. (November 17, 1864 - June 30, 1937) was known as the \\"Father of Palos Verdes\\". He purchased the 16,000 acre Rancho de los Palos Verdes from Jotham Bixby in 1913. In 1916, he built the Vanderlip estates near the Portuguese Bend area of Palos Verdes, California. His descendants still live in the mansion and on other parts of the property.[5] [6] His daughter-in-law Elin Vanderlip maintained residence at the estate until her death in 2009 and her husband's ashes are spread on the grounds. The Vanderlips championed many of the landmarks in Rancho Palos Verdes, notably Wayfarers Chapel (The church was designed by Lloyd Wright (son of Frank Lloyd Wright) in the late 1940s and was built between 1949 and 1951.), Marineland of the Pacific, Portuguese Bend Riding Club (featured in the movie Chinatown), Marymount College, Palos Verdes and Chadwick School.[7] In 1949 Kelvin Cox Vanderlip, Sr. built the Portuguese Bend Beach Club (a gated beach house community The houses were built on lots leased for 25 years and were the typical 1940s weekend places where people went to have a quiet time at the beach. Back then there was a clubhouse, restaurant, paddle tennis courts, 50 foot swimming pool, a sandy beach, and a 485 foot long pier where boats could tie up. =The \\"Big W\\"= The fictional Santa Rosita Beach State Park, with its signature crisscrossed palm trees comprising \\"the Big W\\" amidst lush surroundings and featured in the 1963 comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, was a landscaped set built in 1962 in the backyard of the Harden Gatehouse on Palos Verdes Dr. S, in Rancho Palos Verdes. As of 2016, all of the \\"Big W\\" palms were gone. Geology and landslides During the late Pleistocene, the Palos Verdes hills were an offshore island. The island later became a peninsula, when the region between the island and the mainland filled with alluvial deposits from the mountain ranges near the Los Angeles basin. The Palos Verdes Hills are part of an uplifted block, with a northwest trend, bounded on the northeast by the Palos Verdes fault zone. Most of the movement along this fault is dip-slip, resulting in an uplift of about 1 km of the Palos Verdes Hills relative to the Los Angeles basin. =Surficial deposits= Surficial deposits of the Palos Verdes Hills consists of stratigraphic layers, in order from oldest to youngest: *Late Pleistocene stream terrace gravel *Late Pleistocene marine terrace deposits *Late Quaternary dune sand *Late Quaternary soil *Late Quaternary talus *Late Quaternary non-marine terrace cover *Late Quaternary slope wash and creep deposits *Holocene beach deposits *Holocene alluvium. The ground surface in the central and southern parts of the district is low and hummocky, reflecting the location of numerous late Quaternary landslides. These hills form an elongated topographic dome that rises from sea level to altitudes of more than 430 meters. =Historical landslides= The Palos Verdes Landslide has been conducive to ground failure for approximately 250,000 years. The landslide spans with an average thickness of . The ground failure occurs on an overall smooth surface approximately below the surface. The ground failure over the years has been due to seaward- dipping strata, rock weakness and continual coastal erosion. Prehistoric landslides are believed to be so extensive that they destroyed the formation of higher wave-cut benches. The active slide consists of landslide rubble such as bedded blocks, which are rare among most landslides. The bedded blocks measure ten feet (3 meters) in diameter and they appear in landslide rubble. This shows ground disturbance which could eventually cause the land to slide. =Modern landslides= Large surface rifts caused by the Portuguese Bend landslide Though the Portuguese Bend area had a history of landslides going back 250,000 years and had been officially mapped as a landslide complex before the 1950s, current slippage in the Portuguese Bend area began in 1956, coincident with the construction of a road (the Crenshaw Boulevard extension, south of Crest Road) along the top of the ancient landslide complex. During this construction, excavated sediment was dumped onto the upper slopes of the complex along with hundreds of thousands of gallons of water which lubricated a layer of bentonite clay formed by the subsurface weathering of volcanic rock called tuff. This layer of bentonite slants down to the Pacific ocean enabling down-slope movement which continues to the present. A 1958 video newsreel was shot of the effects of the movement on the homes in the area. A successful suit was filed by area homeowners in 1961, winning $10 million in compensation against Los Angeles County, the party responsible for the road construction. Another possible contributing cause of the sliding was the construction of hundreds of homes on and above the unstable rock and soil in the early 1950s prior to the slide. Each home had its own sewage treatment facility (cesspool or septic system) and home owners established lawns and gardens on their properties. Some homes were damaged, but others remain intact. Homes which remain occupied now have water and sewage lines available to them. The new lines were constructed above ground, so the slide can move freely below them.Joannou v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes, Cal: Court of Appeal, 2nd Appellate Dist., 8th Div. 2013 Description and characterization The first movement indication occurred on Friday, August 17, 1956. Cracking occurred in the foundation of a recently built structure. The cracks were repaired, but new cracking occurred just days later. Ten days after the first indication of movement, cracking propagated to Palos Verdes Drive South. By September 4, an offset of 4 inches (10 cm) was observed on the road. By mid- September, more pronounced cracking was observed. Distortion became noticeable on the Portuguese Bend pier on October 4 of that year. A survey station was installed to monitor ground movement. The station recorded movement of 3 to 4 inches (≈7 to 10 cm) per day. By the end of October, movement slowed to ≈¾ inch (2 cm) per day. The amount it moves is unknown today. Drilling projects over the next several months determined the location of the slip surface, and the location of standing groundwater. The major part of the landslide consists of severely broken rubble. Individual rock fragments appear to be from the middle and upper units of the Altamira Shale, consisting of tuffaceous and silty shale. Fractured blocks of diatomaceous shale are found on the south slope of Blakesley HIll. Individual fragments of chert and cherty shale are found throughout the slide, though they are more abundant west of Portuguese Canyon. At the toe of the slide, between Inspiration Point and Portuguese Point, are weathered boulders of basalt. Drainage within the Portuguese Bend district is characterized by a prevailing southward flow. Several canyons cross the district and act as the primary drainage features, including the Altamira and Portuguese Canyons. These canyons trend southward through the slide complex. Drainage is controlled locally by landslide-related features, such as resistant landslide blocks or channels cut in softer zones.

In recent years, guest lecturers have included Lisa Williams, Dee Wallace, members of Ghost Hunters, Tibetan monks, James Van Praagh, Dr. Wayne Dyer, and Deepak Chopra. Lily Dale was incorporated in 1879 as Cassadaga Lake Free Association, a camp and meeting place for Spiritualists and Freethinkers. The name was changed to The City of Light in 1903 and finally to Lily Dale Assembly in 1906. The purpose of Lily Dale was to further the science, philosophy, and religion of Spiritualism. Lily Dale was featured in the HBO documentary No One Dies in Lily Dale.

She is the operations director at NERV, initially with the rank of captain; she is later promoted to major. In Rebuild of Evangelion Misato's rank is lieutenant colonel. Her duties at NERV include acting as a field commander for the Eva pilots, issuing orders and relaying battle strategies as well as processing input from Ritsuko Akagi and the technicians monitoring the Evas. She also handles many bureaucratic aspects of NERV's operations. At the beginning of the series, Misato first brings Shinji Ikari to NERV and is able to convince him to pilot the Eva Unit 01. She then chooses to have Shinji move in with her rather than live alone, and later takes in Asuka Langley Soryu. As the series progresses, through her former lover Ryoji Kaji she learns the truth behind the Human Instrumentality Project and the depths of deception that NERV and SEELE have gone to keep the Project secret, even from her. Conception Yoshiyuki Sadamoto found Misato's design the most difficult—conceiving her as an older \\"girl next door\\" who was in the military. He wished to have Misato be a fashionable character, changing her clothes constantly, but found that his own lack of fashion sense made him unable to show this. Furthermore, he envisaged Misato as a \\"loser girl\\" who would be promiscuous and not take things seriously. Director Hideaki Anno described Misato as \\"a woman, twenty-nine, who lives life so lightly as to barely allow the possibility of human touch. She protects herself by keeping relationships on the surface, and by running away.\\" He has described her as an adult Usagi Tsukino, with whom she shares a voice actress as well as hair design.新世紀エヴァンゲリオン完全攻略読本, 1997, Shinseiki Fukuin Kyoukai, The disparity between her professionalism on the job and her slovenliness at home, as well as her issues in her relationships with her father and Kaji and the ambiguous nature of her relationship with Shinji, ties into her psychological issues. (Incidentally, her psychological issues resemble Shinji's, so the two gradually begin to retain sympathy for each other as the story develops in spite of their clumsy relationship.) While grateful to her father for saving her life, she admits to hating him, as he devoted his life to his work and neglected her and her mother. Her reason for joining Nerv (and later, her drive to fight the Angels) is related to her issues with her father. Kaji implies in one discussion that Misato suffers from nightmares about her past, as he describes her as \\"sleeping uncomfortably.\\" Misato admits \\"seeking her father in Kaji's embrace.\\" Like many characters in Evangelion, Misato was named for a ship: the Katsuragi, an Unryū class World War II Japanese aircraft carrier. Her given name is from a heroine in Minako Narita's manga Aitsu. Misato drives a bright blue Renault Alpine A310. She is a devotee of this particular marque of car, as on her bedroom wall she has a poster of an earlier Alpine A110 shot from the back during a race. She carries a Heckler & Koch USP as a sidearm. It is only seen a few times, but she is revealed to be a crack shot with it. Appearances =Neon Genesis Evangelion= At the beginning of the anime Misato is the of Nerv's Tactical Operations Department. Under her command, most of the important decisions in the battles between the Evas against the angels are made, and she takes complete responsibility of the possible outcomes. She also assumes Shinji Ikari's guardianship when he arrives in Tokyo-3, and later Asuka's. Her civilian personality is seen to be quite loose and sloppy, but professionally she proves to have a great sense of leadership and duty. Her loyalty to Nerv appears to be unbreakable, although apart from the main objective of annihilating the angels, she is unaware of Nerv's underlying intentions. After the success of \\"Operation Yashima,\\" a high-cost military operation masterminded by her which consisted of using the entire energy system of Japan to destroy the fifth Angel, Ramiel, she was promoted to . Misato's only friend throughout the series is Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, and she was Ryoji Kaji's girlfriend when the three of them were college students. As the story progresses, further detail of Misato's past are revealed, such as the fact that she was in Antarctica at the moment of the Second Impact, accompanying her father, Dr. Katsuragi, who masterminded the Katsuragi expedition related to the discovery of the first Angel, Adam. Prior to the unfolding of the Second impact, Dr. Katsuragi attempted to protect his daughter by placing her in a protective capsule (resembling an Entry Plug) seconds before the explosion. The capsule saved her life, but her injuries left a large scar on her chest. Two years later, Misato is seen aboard the ship which brought Kozo Fuyutsuki and Gendo Ikari to the ruins of Antarctica to inspect the aftermath of the Second Impact. Upon coming across her, Fuyutsuki is told that Misato has not spoken since the Second Impact. Her mutism went away when she began attending college, and since then she becomes more social and talkative; Ritsuko recalls that during college Misato was making up for the wasted time. Misato's job experience prior to Nerv is not revealed; however, in the manga, it is mentioned that her previous job involved genetic experimentation on animals, with Pen Pen being the result of one such experiments. She chose to keep Pen Pen as a pet rather than let him be euthanized, and refurnished a refrigerator to become his bedroom. Misato's relationship with Kaji is shown to be rather complicated, involving love, lust, jealousy, and resemblances to her father, apart from a pseudo-love triangle with Kaji and Ritsuko. As the story progresses, Misato learns that Kaji is a double-agent, working for Nerv and simultaneously reporting to the Intelligence Department of Japan. Misato threatens to kill Kaji if he refuses to abandon his plans to sabotage Nerv. However, Kaji is the one who confides confidential information to her regarding Nerv and Seele's secret plans, particularly the Human Instrumentality Project. =The End of Evangelion= In The End of Evangelion, Misato saves Shinji's life by killing three JSSDF soldiers. She drags him into her car and rushes Shinji towards the door of Unit 01's launch bay. However, Misato is mortally wounded in the process. She persuades Shinji to pilot Unit 01 one more time before giving an adult kiss. Shortly before dying, Misato wonders if Kaji believes she has done the right thing. Her body is destroyed by JSSDF demolition teams. Just moments before the explosion, an image of Rei is shown above her body. =Manga= In the manga Misato's story and character has minor tweaks. The manga shows she took Pen-Pen in after saving him from being euthanized. Her death scene is similar to End of Evangelion, but she kills herself and multiple JSDF soldiers with a grenade. =Rebuild of Evangelion= Misato Katsuragi in Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo Misato returns as a central character in Rebuild of Evangelion. Her first appearance in this continuity is in Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone, where she appears to be almost identical to her anime counterpart apart from some minor differences, such as her hair being a darker shade of purple. In Rebuild, Misato appears to be more involved in what is going on at Nerv and her rank is . Because of that, she actually knows about their possession of Lilith. In Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance, Misato encourages Shinji to get closer to his father and also brings Asuka into her household in hopes of establishing camaraderie between the two pilots. She plays more of a big sister role towards Asuka and also does not restart her romantic relationship with Kaji. In a flashback regarding Second Impact, Misato is shown to have been awake and seen her father die before her eyes in this continuity. After her Renault Alpine is damaged during Asuka's arrival, she drives a first- generation Mazda Cosmo. In Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, her character undergoes profound changes. She is now the head of the organization known as Wille, which aims at the destruction of Nerv and its Evangelions. She is seen much more indifferent than in any of the previous chapters of the series, and her appearance went through drastic changes as well, making Shinji unable to recognize her when he sees her for the first time. Misato is willing to kill Shinji by activating a choker Wille has put in his neck if he has contact with an Evangelion again. When Shinji escapes from Wille's craft, she hesitates to pull the trigger until he is out of range of the detonator, allowing his escape. =In other media= Misato appears in many media based on Neon Genesis Evangelion, including the manga adaptation of the anime by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. She also appears in various video games based on the franchise, including the popular cross-over series Super Robot Wars. In the Super Robot Wars games featuring Evangelion and Gundam (UC timeline), Misato develops a crush on ace pilot Amuro Ray, alluding to their voice actors' other famous anime roles as Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask respectively. She also makes some Sailor Moon comments when admiring the Nobel Gundam from Mobile Fighter G Gundam on Super Robot Wars MX, and points out similarities in voice with Vega from Gear Fighter Dendoh and Murrue Ramius from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED (two other characters voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi). In Transformers x Evangelion while heading NERV efforts against an Angel, Misato witnessed the arrival of the Autobots and was perplexed by their presence. Mode \\"Eva\\" chapter 1 When Starscream possessed the Angel, Misato called for Eva-01 to be activated. Mode \\"Eva\\" chapter 2 However, she was in for another surprise when Optimus Prime scanned Eva-01 and became like it in both color and size! Mode \\"Eva\\" chapter 3 Misato watched the ensuing battle between Optimus and Starscream, noting that the Decepticon had access to the Angels' A.T. Field ability and radioing the Autobot Wheeljack to let him know NERV was relying on them, having no other Evas ready for deployment. When the Autobots worked to catch Starscream off balance, she helped out by having Tokyo-3 transform around the Decepticon, causing him to stumble and allowing Prime to defeat him. After the battle, the Autobots joined NERV in defending Earth against Angels and Decepticons alike, something Misato viewed with mixed anxiety and expectation.https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Misato_Katsuragihttp://www.zonebase.org/2017/10/transformers- mode-eva-chapters-1-4.html?m=1 Reception Writer Joe Milutis impersonally described Misato as being \\"in no way a mother figure\\", and as encouraging Shinji to view her as \\"vacillating between hip guardian and possible sexual object\\".

The book is a pastiche of the classic 1605 and 1615 Spanish novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes with many moments of comedy, but also offers reflection on matters such as life after a dictatorship, Communism, and the Catholic faith. Plot summary Father Quixote, a parish priest in the little town of El Toboso in Spain's La Mancha region, regards himself as a descendant of Cervantes' character of the same name, even if people point out to him that Don Quixote was a fictitious character. One day, he helps and gives food to a mysterious Italian bishop whose car has broken down. Shortly afterwards, he is given the title of monsignor by the Pope, much to the surprise of his bishop who looks upon Father Quixote's activities rather with suspicion. He urges the priest to take a holiday, and so Quixote embarks upon a voyage through Spain with his old Seat 600 called \\"Rocinante\\" and in the company of the Communist ex-mayor of El Toboso (who, of course, is nicknamed \\"Sancho\\"). In the subsequent course of events, Quixote and his companion have all sorts of funny and moving adventures along the lines of his ancestor's on their way through post-Franco Spain. They encounter the contemporary equivalents of the windmills, are confronted with holy and not-so-holy places and with sinners of all sorts. In their dialogues about Catholicism and Communism, the two men are brought closer, start to appreciate each other better but also to question their own beliefs. Quixote is briefly taken back to El Toboso, confronted by the bishop about his doings and suspended from service as a priest, but he escapes and sets out again with Sancho. In his last adventure, Father Quixote is struck down and wounded while attempting to save a statue of the Virgin Mary from hypocrites who are desecrating her by offering her up for money. This is the scene from the original Cervantes' novel refurbished with reversed accents: Quixote does know Who the Lady is, while the people in the procession actually don't. Quixote and Sancho are brought to a Trappist monastery where, sleepwalking and in delirium, Father Quixote rises from his bed at night, goes to the church, celebrates the old Tridentine Mass--all the time imagining he holds bread and wine in his hands--and then, in a last effort, administers communion to the Communist ex-mayor before sinking dead into his friend's arms. Television adaptations In 1985, Greene and Christopher Neame adapted Monsignor Quixote as a television film starring Alec Guinness and Leo McKern, as well as featuring several other notable actors including Ian Richardson and Graham Crowden. Richardson and Crowden have also appeared in other versions of the Quixote story – Richardson in Man of La Mancha, and Crowden in the 2000 made-for-TV version of Don Quixote, starring John Lithgow. Radio adaptations In 2016, Stephen Wyatt adapted the novel for BBC Radio 4's 15 Minute Drama. The ten-episode adaptation, directed by Marc Beeby, starred Bernard Cribbins as Quixote and Philip Jackson as Sancho. There is also an unabridged audio version of the book read by Cyril Cusack.

It is different by supporting multiple protocols, providing higher scalability through asynchronous I/O and aims to be less conservative with new feature development. Historically NaviServer was the original name of the server, a closed-source product by a company called NaviSoft in the early 1990s. It was bought by AOL in 1995, and released as open-source in 1999 as AOLserver after they released Mozilla. This friendly-fork takes the code back to its original name.

It was situated to the west of the Great Float, between Bidston and Poulton. History The three iron ore unloading cranes in 1967, seen from Wallasey A proposal for the construction of the dock on most of what remained of the tidal inlet of Wallasey Pool was outlined in the 1920s. Consisting of the main basin and four additional branches, only part of the main dock was eventually built. Bidston dock was opened in March 1933 and originally known as the West Float extension. The dock was first used for laying up ships, such as the Ellerman Lines' City of London and City of York. In 1947 the Greek liner Matrona capsized at her moorings when her ballast was removed during conversion work. Having been refloated in June 1948 by seven locomotives operating on specially built tracks, she was towed to Barrow-In-Furness for scrapping. In 1952 the Bibby Line vessel Somersetshire boarded crew at Bidston Dock prior to service as an emigrant ship to Australia. The dock was significantly altered in the 1950s to allow the transportation of iron ore bound for Shotton. The dock had a trio of large moveable cranes to unload the iron ore, which were dismantled in the late 1990s. The northern quayside of Bidston Dock was the iron ore berth, which was operated by Rea Ltd. The southern quayside was unallocated. By 1992, the dock was only being used for laying up ships, such as the Isle of Man Steam Packet vessels. Some of the final traffic through the dock involved the transportation of timber. Bidston Dock was subsequently closed and was landfilled by 2003. The dock was served by the Birkenhead Dock Branch railway line and an iron ore train ran regularly to the John Summers Steelworks in Shotton. Monthly shipments of iron ore arrived at Bidston Dock from 1956. Due to the nature of the train, a high degree of motive power was required. Class 40s and pairs of Class 25 locomotives are known to have operated on this track, during its latter days. In the steam era, the iron ore train was known to have been hauled by Class 9F locomotives. The Class 9F locomotive 92203, later named as Black Prince, worked the final steam-hauled iron ore train in November 1967. The infilled site in 2007 Though the dock itself was filled, the northern quayside, on which the cranes were situated, and the railway sidings are still intact, although disused. Future Peel Holdings have expressed an interest to develop the site of the former dock, as part of the Wirral Waters regeneration project. This part of the project would encompass of leisure facilities and a retail park.

Such ferries operate faster and more effectively in rivers with strong currents. Some reaction ferries operate using an overhead cable suspended from towers anchored on either bank of the river. Others use a floating cable attached to a single anchorage that may be on one bank or mid-channel. Where an overhead cable is used a \\"traveller\\" is usually installed on the cable and the ferry is attached to the traveller by a bridle cable. To operate the ferry either the bridle cable is adjusted or a rudder is used, causing the ferry to be angled into the current, and the force of the current moves the ferry across the river. The ferry may consist of a single hull, or two pontoons with a deck bridging them. Some ferries carry only passengers, whilst others carry road vehicles, with some examples carrying up to 12 cars.

It consisted of a standard M117 750-pound bomb case with a KMU-342 laser guidance and control kit. This consisted of a gimballed laser seeker on the front of the bomb and tail and control fins to guide the bomb to the target. These latter used the bang-bang method of control where each control surface was either straight or fully deflected. This was inefficient aerodynamically, but reduced costs and minimized demands on the primitive on-board electronics. 497th TFS F-4D with two BOLT-117s at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, 1971. Originally the project began as a surface to air missile seeker developed by Texas Instruments. When TI executive Glenn E. Penisten attempted to sell the new technology to the AirForce, Col. Joe Davis Jr. inquired if it could instead be used as a ground attack system to overcome problems US aircraft were having with accuracy of bombing in Vietnam. Col.Davis had already witnessed a test of the Army's new laser target designator made by Martin Marietta, but no seeker existed to make use of the system. Davis had already performed tests from the back seat of an F-4 Phantom and proved that it was possible to accurately target objects from a moving aircraft. His mock testing proved correct, and during further testing with live seekers it took just 6 attempts to improves the seeker accuracy from 148 feet to within 10 feet of the target. This greatly exceeded the design requirements. It was commissioned by the United States Air Force in 1967 and successfully completed a combat evaluation in 1968. The system was sent to Vietnam and performed well. Without the existence of tracking pods the Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) in the back seat of an F-4 Phantom II fighter bomber used a hand-held Airborne Laser Designator to guide the bombs, but half of the LGBs still hit their targets despite the difficulties inherent in keeping the laser on the target. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/2002/12/15/bursts- of-brilliance/0c06b132-2d70-41e6-882e-5c4ece8f5fcf/ Placement of the control surfaces on the rear of the bomb proved to be less than ideal as it limited the ability of the fins to control the bomb's trajectory. Only a limited number of BOLT-117 bombs were produced before it was discontinued in favour of the more accurate Paveway I family of guidance kits that moved the control fins to the front of the bomb. The Paveway variant was very successful and over 28,000 Paveway weapons were dropped during the war in Vietnam. The impact of the BOLT-117 on aerial warfare was revolutionary, allowing destruction of targets even other existing precision weapons had difficulty destroying due to having small warheads and difficulty tracking certain types of objects. Earlier electro-optical weapons such as the AGM-62 Walleye could accurately strike targets with small outlines and good contrast on camera, but had difficulty hitting large oddly shaped structures like bridges. Laser guided weapons allowed far greater precision against these types of targets, and with much larger warheads.John Darrell Sherwood, Nixon's Trident: Naval Power in Southeast Asia, 1968–1972, (Washington: DC: Naval Historical Center, forthcoming).https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/2002/12/15/bursts- of-brilliance/0c06b132-2d70-41e6-882e-5c4ece8f5fcf/ Another equally important improvement was the ability to use add-on guidance kits to turn standard \\"dumb\\" ordnance into precision-guided munition yielding a considerable increase in effectiveness compared with free-falling, unguided bombs, and doing so at a fraction of the cost of other guided weapons. The cost of the add-on kits was only a few percent of the original $100,000 price goal.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/2002/12/15/bursts- of-brilliance/0c06b132-2d70-41e6-882e-5c4ece8f5fcf/ References External links * BOLT-117 (BOmb, Laser Terminal-117) - Global Security * Texas Instruments Paveway I & Pave Storm - Designation Systems * Modern glide bombs on Vectorsite * BOLT-117 at nd.edu Category:Cold War aerial bombs of the United States Category:Weapon guidance Category:Guided bombs of the United States Category:Texas Instruments ","title":"BOLT-117"},{"id":"1146872","text":"Scollay Square, Boston, 19th century (after September 1880) Scollay Square, Decoration Day, 19th century (after September 1880) Scollay Square (c. 1838–1962) was a vibrant city square in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. It was named for William Scollay, a prominent local developer and militia officer who bought a landmark four-story merchant building at the intersection of Cambridge and Court Streets in 1795. Local citizens began to refer to the intersection as Scollay's Square, and, in 1838, the city officially memorialized the intersection as Scollay Square. Early on, the area was a busy center of commerce, including daguerreotypist (photographer) Josiah Johnson Hawes (1808-1901) and Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, the first dentist to use ether as an anaesthetic. As early as the 1950s city officials had been mulling plans to completely tear the Square down and redevelop the area. Eventually more than 1,000 buildings were demolished and 20,000 residents were displaced. With $40 million in federal funds, the city built an entirely new development there, Government Center.  History  Detail of 1888 map of Boston, showing vicinity of Scollay Square Scollay Square was located \\"at the junction of Tremont and Court streets, Cornhill and Tremont Row\\". Initially the city designated it Pemberton Square, but changed the name to \\"Scollay Square\\" when Phillips Square changed its own name to \\"Pemberton Square\\". The building that gave the area its name, Scollay's Building, was the last remnant of a once-larger group of buildings: \\"at one time a wedge-shaped row of wooden buildings, extending from the head of Cornhill to opposite the head of Hanover street, separated Tremont row from Court street (see Bonner's map, 1722); at the southeasterly end the second schoolhouse in the town was erected, 1683-84; at various times portions of these buildings were removed, leaving only the Scollay brick building, supposed to have been built by Patrick Jeffrey, who came into possession in 1795; named for William Scollay, an apothecary... removed about 1870.\\"Boston Street Laying-Out Dept.

City of Boston Printing Dept., 1910; p.414. = Culture = Scollay Square, Boston, after September 1880 ; Old Howard Theatre Among the most famous (and infamous) of Scollay Square landmarks was the Old Howard Theatre, a grand theater which began life as the headquarters of a Millerite Adventist Christian sect which believed the world would end in October 1844. After the world failed to end on schedule, the building was sold in 1844 and reopened as a vaudeville and Shakespearean venue. Later, in the 1900s and 1910s, it would showcase the popular minstrel shows.A Brief History of Scollay Square. http://www.bambinomusical.com/Scollay/History.html By around the 1940s the Scollay Square area began to lose its vibrant commercial activity, and the Howard gradually changed its image and began to cater to sailors on leave and college students by including burlesque shows, as did other nearby venues such as the Casino Theater and Crawford House. \\"Always Something Doing\\" became the Old Howard's advertising slogan. The venue also showcased boxing matches with boxers including Rocky Marciano, and continued to feature slapstick vaudeville acts, from likes of The Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello. But it was the success and prominence of the burlesque shows that brought the Old Howard down. In 1953, vice squad agents sneaked a home movie camera into the Old Howard, and caught Mary Goodneighbor on film doing her striptease for the audience. The film led to the closure of the theater, and it remained closed until it caught fire mysteriously in 1961. The square was also the home of Austin and Stone's Dime Museum. ; John Winthrop Statue To mark the 250th anniversary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the sculptor Richard Saltonstall Greenough was commissioned to create a bronze sculpture of John Winthrop, the first Governor of the state. The statue was installed in September 1880. =Abolitionism= Militia tries to maintain order in Scollay Square during the 1919 Boston Police Strike Scollay Square was also a flashpoint for the early abolition movement. Author William Lloyd Garrison was twice attacked by an angry mob for printing his anti-slavery newspaper The Liberator, which began publication in 1831. Sarah Parker Remond's first act of civil disobedience occurred in 1853 at the Old Howard when she was refused the seat she had purchased but was instead seated in the 'black' section. Many of the buildings in the area in and around Scollay Square had hidden spaces where escaped slaves were hidden, as part of the Underground Railroad. =Destruction and redevelopment= Governor Foster Furcolo and Mayor John F. Collins in the 1960s holding plans to build Government Center in place of Scollay Square By the end of World War II, Scollay Square had deteriorated into a shanty town and a red-light district. The Old Howard had become an increasingly tawdry burlesque establishment. As early as the 1950s, city officials had been mulling plans to completely tear down and redevelop the Scollay Square area, in order to remove lower-income residents and troubled businesses from the aging and seedy district. Attempts to reopen the sullied Old Howard by its old performers had been one of the last efforts against redevelopment; but with the theater gutted by fire, a city wrecking ball began the project of demolishing more than 1,000 buildings in the area; 20,000 residents were displaced. The city offered to give any demolished materials to anyone who could load and take away a full dump truck load. The materials included street paving blocks (Belgian blocks quarried in Quincy), granite, lintels, and bricks. With $40 million in federal funds, the city built an entirely new development on top of old Scollay Square, renaming the area Government Center, and peppering it with city, state, and federal government buildings: Boston City Hall, City Hall Plaza, Government Service Center, and the Edward W. Brooke Courthouse. References in popular culture * Pearl Schiff's best-selling 1952 novel, Scollay Square, tells the story of a young woman's affair with a sailor she met in a Scollay Square tavern.

Most of its vote, however, is cast in the counties bordering Cincinnati. On December 15, 2011, Davis announced he would not seek reelection in 2012. On July 31, 2012, he announced his resignation from Congress effective immediately.http://1.usa.gov/M9LUmf Early life, education, and business career Davis was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to American parents (one of few House members to be born in Quebec). After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army and later received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, Davis studied national security and international affairs, as well as the Arabic language. In the U.S. Army he served as an aviation officer, eventually becoming an Assault Helicopter Flight Commander in the 82nd Airborne Division. Davis also ran U.S. Army aviation operations for peace enforcement between Israel and Egypt. During his U.S. Army career, he attained both Senior Parachutist and Ranger qualification.

In the 2004 race for the open seat, Davis defeated his Democratic opponent Nick Clooney, father of actor George Clooney, 54%–44%. 2006 On January 30, 2006, Lucas announced he would challenge Davis later that year. The announcement instantly turned the race into one of the hottest in the campaign cycle, even though the 4th is considered the most Republican district in Kentucky. Despite a substantial Democratic advantage in voter registration, the influence of the heavily Republican northern Kentucky suburbs kept the district in Republican hands from 1967 until Lucas won the seat in 1998. In August Congressional Quarterly rated this race as \\"Lean Republican.\\" In late July the Washington Post also rated the race as a toss- up. A SurveyUSA poll released on July 25, 2006 showed Lucas leading 50% to 41%. However, the most recent independent SurveyUSA poll shows Davis up by two percentage points (46% Davis – 44% Lucas). Davis has a decisive lead in fundraising. The Cook Political Report, an independent non-partisan newsletter, rated the race for Kentucky's 4th Congressional District as a \\"Republican Toss-Up\\", meaning either party has a good chance of winning. Davis won re-election 52%–43%, a margin of 17,023 votes. 2008 Davis won re- election with 63% of the vote, defeating Michael Kelley. 2010 Davis campaigning with Rand Paul, Sen. Jim DeMint and Rep. Ron Paul in 2010 Davis was challenged by Democrat John Waltz, whom he defeated with 69% of the votes cast. =Tenure= Davis has a solidly conservative voting record; according to his congressional website, he has positioned himself as anti-abortion and in favor of industrial deregulation. In November 2005, Davis made headlines for his response to Pennsylvania representative John Murtha's call for withdrawal from Iraq, saying, \\"Ayman Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, as well as Abu Musab Zarqawi, have made it quite clear in their internal propaganda that they cannot win unless they can drive the Americans out. And they know that they can't do that there, so they've brought the battlefield to the halls of Congress. And, frankly, the liberal leadership have put politics ahead of sound, fiscal and national security policy. And what they have done is cooperated with our enemies and are emboldening our enemies.\\" Davis faced harsh criticism for his remarks, including, for example, from the Democratic Veterans of Northern Kentucky, and sparked a drive led by national Democratic Party leaders to get Ken Lucas to run against him in 2006. Davis is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined \\"unlawful Internet gambling\\"). In October 2009, Davis filed the REINS (Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny) Act which would give Congress an up or down vote on major rules. A re-introduced version of the bill passed the House on December 7, 2011, but was not taken up by the Senate. In 2011, Davis voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. Contributors The Davis campaign has received contributions from the Americans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (ARMPAC), which was led by former Texas Congressman Tom DeLay. As of June 30, 2006, according to the Federal Election Commission, of the $2.4 million contributed to the Davis campaign for the current 2006 electoral cycle, $10,000 was contributed by ARMPAC. Tom DeLay is the subject of indictments sought by Ronnie Earle, the district attorney for Travis County, Texas, alleging violations of Texas campaign-finance law. Judge Pat Priest has dismissed one indictment against DeLay, the second has not yet come to trial. The charges against DeLay are considered by some to be politically motivated. Democrats have indicated that they consider the ARMPAC contributions to be a campaign issue. Davis was never accused of any misconduct. Davis has received donations from Republican Duke Cunningham, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. Davis has not chosen to give back the money from Cunningham, while many other recipients have. Davis received a donation from Congressman Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty for bribery and his involvement with convicted felon Jack Abramoff. Controversies On April 12, 2008, at a Northern Kentucky Lincoln Day dinner, Davis compared the campaign slogans of Barack Obama to the sales pitch of a \\"snake oil salesman\\". He said in his remarks at the GOP dinner that he participated in a \\"highly classified, national security simulation\\" with Obama. \\"I'm going to tell you something: That boy's finger does not need to be on the button,\\" Davis added. \\"He could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country.\\" Davis also made reference to Obama as being put into the Senate by someone who will probably spend many years of his life in prison (presumably a reference to Tony Rezko) and that Obama had never had a real job before. Davis later apologized for his comment in a letter: Resignation On July 31, 2012, Geoff Davis resigned from Congress due to family health issues, effective immediately. Governor Steve Beshear called for a special election to fill the seat to occur the same day as the general election in November, which would allow the winner to be sworn in immediately. =Committee assignments= * Committee on Ways and Means ** Subcommittee on Trade ** Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures References External links * Geoff Davis for Congress official campaign site * * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Baptists from Kentucky Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Kentucky Category:Kentucky Republicans Category:People from Hebron, Kentucky Category:Politicians from Montreal Category:United States Military Academy alumni Category:United States Army officers Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Geoff Davis"},{"id":"1146934","text":"Office Killer is a 1997 American comedy-horror film directed by Cindy Sherman. It was released in 1997 and stars Carol Kane, Molly Ringwald and David Thornton.  Plot  A magazine editor named Dorine, due to budget cuts, is forced to work from home. One night she is called to help fix the computer of a co-worker, Gary Michaels, who is electrocuted while trying to fix the wires. Dorine dials 911, but hangs up when the call is answered. She places the corpse on a cart, rolls it down to her car, loads it in her trunk, and takes it home, placing it in her basement. Then, seemingly without reason, she goes into a murder spree. She begins her spree by murdering another office worker, but later murders two young Girl Scouts who arrive at her door to sell cookies. The young girls join the other corpses in the basement, and Dorine is seen eating the cookies while working on her new laptop. Dorine sends messages from Gary to the remaining office workers, implying he is alive. There are three more murders before the movie ends, all artistically executed. The last murder is the office manager (played by a young Jeanne Tripplehorn), who awakens in the basement, surrounded by dismembered bodies, after being knocked out by Dorine on a lunch date. After dispatching the office manager's boyfriend, who had come searching for her (a young Michael Imperioli) with a kitchen knife, Dorine murders the office manager after taunting her for making her and other employees work from home. The last scene shows Dorine, after her mother's death, setting fire to her basement, then, sporting a blond wig and makeup and with the office manager's head in a bag on the seat beside her, driving away in her car, and circling a newspaper ad with her pencil for an office job.

The dock was accessed via East Float to the west, until Wallasey Dock was filled at the turn of the millennium. History Construction began in 1874 and the dock opened in 1877, replacing the Great Low Water Basin of 1863, which had opened directly onto the River Mersey to the east. Situated between Alfred Dock to the north and Morpeth Dock to the south, access to the river was westwards through East Float. The dock sheds were used for grain storage and then for imported livestock. In 1890, a pumping station was installed on the river wall adjoining to the dock. This slowly silted the dock, and by the 1960s the dock had silted up, leaving the dock derelict by 1992.

Francesca Caccini (; 18 September 1587 – after 1641) was an Italian composer, singer, lutenist, poet, and music teacher of the early Baroque era. She was also known by the nickname \\"La Cecchina\\" , given to her by the Florentines and probably a diminutive of \\"Francesca\\". She was the daughter of Giulio Caccini. Her only surviving stage work, La liberazione di Ruggiero, is widely considered the oldest opera by a woman composer. Life Caccini was born in Florence, and received a humanistic education (Latin, some Greek, as well as modern languages and literature, mathematics) in addition to early musical training with her father. According to Liliana Panella, the first well-founded testimony of Francesca's singer's activity, together with her sister Settimia, at the Medici court, is 1602: in his diary Cesare Tinghi notes that on 3 April 1602 St. Nicholas church in Pisa, where the court moved every year during Lent, polychoral music was directed by \\"Giulio Romano [Giulio Caccini], having the wife (the second wife, Margherita) and the two daughters singing well\\". Rome In her early life, Caccini performed with her parents, her half-brother Pompeo, her sister Settimia, and possibly other unnamed Caccini pupils in an ensemble contemporaries referred to as le donne di Giulio Romano. After she was hired by the court, she continued to perform with the family ensemble until Settimia's marriage and resulting move to Mantua caused its breakup. Caccini served the Medici court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until early 1627. By 1614 she was the court's most highly paid musician, in no small part because her musical virtuosity so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany's de facto Regent, Grand-Duchess Christina of Lorraine. By 1623 she earned 240 scudi. \\"La Bella by Palma il Vecchio\\"—Portrait of Francesca Caccini Caccini is believed to have been a quick and prolific composer, equal in productivity to her court colleagues Jacopo Peri and Marco da Gagliano. Very little of her music survives. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies by poet Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger (grand-nephew of the artist) such as La Tancia (1613), Il passatempo (1614) and La fiera (1619). In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets (Il primo libro delle musiche) that is a compendium of contemporary styles, ranging from intensely moving, harmonically adventurous laments to joyful sacred songs in Italian and Latin, to witty strophic songs about the joys and perils of romantic love.Primo Libro delle Musiche (Caccini, Francesca) at IMSLP.org Accessed 31 October 2017 For most of these songs, Caccini used her own poetry. In winter 1625 Caccini composed all the music for a 75-minute \\"comedy-ballet\\" entitled La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d'Alcina which was performed for the visiting crown prince of Poland, Ladislaus Sigismondo (later Władysław IV). Combining witty parodies of early opera's stock scenes and self-important characters with moments of surprising emotional intensity, the score shows that Caccini had mastered the full range of musico-theatrical devices in her time and that she had had a strong sense of large-scale musical design. La liberazione so pleased the prince that he had it performed in Warsaw in 1628. After Caccini's first husband (Giovanni Battista Signorini, with whom she had one daughter, Margherita, in 1622) died in December 1626, she quickly arranged to marry again in October 1627, this time to a melophile nobleman in Lucca, Tommaso Raffaelli. She lived in Raffaelli's Lucchese homes, apparently bearing a son (also Tommaso, in 1628), and having some musical relationship to the Buonvisi family in Lucca, until his death in 1630.Rebecca Cypess: \\"Francesca Caccini: Italian composer and singer\\" at britannica.com Accessed 2 November 2017 Although as the wife of a nobleman she had declined at least one request to perform (in Parma, in 1628), once she was widowed Caccini immediately tried to return to Medici service. Her return delayed by the plagues of 1630–33, by 1634 Caccini was back in Florence with her two children, serving the court as music teacher to her daughter Margherita and to the Medici princesses who lived at or frequently visited the convent of La Crocetta, and composing and performing chamber music and minor entertainments for the women's court. Caccini left Medici service on 8 May 1641, and disappeared from the public record. Works Francesca Caccini wrote some or all of the music for at least sixteen staged works. All but La liberazione di Ruggiero and some excerpts from La Tancia and Il passatempo published in the 1618 collection are believed lost. Her surviving scores reveal Caccini to have taken extraordinary care over the notation of her music, focusing special attention on the rhythmic placement of syllables and words, especially within ornaments, on phrasing as indicated by slurs, and on the precise notation of often very long, melodically fluid vocal melismas. Although her music is not especially notable for the expressive dissonances made fashionable by her contemporary Monteverdi, Caccini was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates affect. *La Stiava (performed 1607) (lost) *Ballo delle Zigane (written 1615) (lost) *Il Primo libro delle musiche a 1–2 voci e basso continuo (1618) *La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d'Alcina (1625) References Notes Sources * Further reading Harness, Kelley (2006).

In publication between 1991 and 2015, it was part of Future plc's Format series of magazines that include articles about games, entertainment and how to get the most out of the platform. Despite the occasional mention of alternatives, PC Format takes the term 'PC' to mean a Microsoft Windows-based computer. Details Aimed at a reader with an age of around 30, PCF is far more irreverent and opinionated than its competition, edging it towards being a lifestyle magazine as well as a computing one. In its earlier days, it promoted itself as a PC entertainment magazine - meaning it was not aimed at the business market, and it was not aimed at solely games. This included content such as video editing, animation, web design, and others - many of which were not very common on the PC at the time. PC Format has included a cover disk or cover CD, as many other computer magazines. Initially these were in 5¼\\" and 3½\\" inch floppy disk formats; this standard progressed to CD-ROM and DVD-ROM as technology advanced. Now however, the CD version does not exist, and only the DVD version remains. You cannot buy the magazine on its own without a disc. PC Format has prided itself on being unbiased with its reviews, and has frequently given low scores to blockbuster, but poor quality, games. It uses the full range of 0-100% for its game reviews, rather than having 50% for a bad game and 100% for a great game. The magazine rarely awards anything between 30% and 50%, only showing radical scores for games since mediocre games are difficult to review. Scores over 90% are very rarely granted. If a game scores above 90% it receives a PCF Gold award. Before the magazine was redesigned in January 2007, the magazine also awarded 80% plus scores with a high score or top gear award. Immediately prior to PC Format's launch, the Format series encompassed three platforms - Commodore Format, ST Format and Amiga Format. The magazines in the 'Format' series today are MacFormat (launched 1993), Linux Format (launched 2000), and PC Format. PCFormat's website is part of the TechRadar.com network of sites, Future plc's technology portal. Content The main content of the magazine includes previews and reviews of the latest games, software and hardware reviews, computing news, a wide range of tutorials and a technical help section. It also includes left-field and investigative features on wider computing culture. Since the redesign, the magazine has focused more on games (PLAY) and performance hardware (WIRED), instead of the greater range previously explored. There is now also a much greater emphasis on Overclocking and Modding articles, keeping in line with the new performance hardware and gaming focus. The magazine has gradually shifted its focus away from games, concentrating more on hardware. As of the September 2010 issue, typically no more than four games are reviewed each month. Format as of January 2007 * DOWNLOAD: Technology and PC news, previously included monthly Guerrilla Testing for solving often irrelevant computing issues. (For example: What are the best gloves to wear whilst fitting a graphics card?) * UPLOAD: Readers' letters and monthly competition. * PLAY: Games previews and reviews. Includes features such as in-depth guides, recommended games and a \\"Replay\\" review. * WIRED: Hardware reviews, includes a main in-depth supertest comparison with benchmarks, a smaller \\"roundup\\" group test and technology previews. As of 2008, PC modding features; overclocking tips, \\"I Am The Mod\\", Quick Fix tutorials and custom hardware guide found in the now defunct \\"HOTWIRED\\" section are found here. * FEATURES: Not an individual section of the magazine, but every issue comes with in-depth game or hardware articles that are featured in either PLAY or WIRED. * REGULAR ITEMS: ** Welcome ** Disc Pages ** Ask Luis: Readers' computing questions are answered by Technology writer Luis Villazon.

It is the first of Roth's novels narrated by Nathan Zuckerman, one of the author's putative fictional alter egos, and constitutes the first book in his Zuckerman Bound trilogy. The novel touches on themes common to many Roth works, including identity, the responsibilities of authors to their subjects, and the condition of Jews in America. Parts of the novel are a reprise of The Diary of Anne Frank.Moraru, Christian (2005) Memorious discourse: reprise and representation in postmodernism, pp.224-25  Plot introduction Nathan Zuckerman is a promising young writer who spends a night in the home of E.I. Lonoff (a portrait, it has been argued, of Bernard Malamud or Henry Roth, or a composite of both), an established author whom Zuckerman idolizes. Also staying in the Lonoff home is Amy Bellette, a young woman with a vague past whom the narrator apparently comes to suspect of being Anne Frank, living in the United States anonymously, having survived the Holocaust. Television movie In 1983 a television adaptation was made of the book in the UK. It was directed by Tristram Powell and starred Rose Arrick, Claire Bloom, Sam Wanamaker, Cecile Mann, MacIntyre Dixon, Mark Linn-Baker, Ralph Morse, Joseph Wiseman, and Patricia Fellows. Critical reception The book was widely praised at publication. In The New Yorker, John Updike described Roth as \\"Always one of the most intelligent and energetic of American writers, he has now become one of the most scrupulous.\\" In The New York Times Book Review, critic Harold Bloom said of the three collected Zuckerman novels, \\"Zuckerman Bound merits something reasonably close to the highest level of esthetic praise for tragicomedy.\\" In 2018, The Ghost Writer was listed as one of Roth's seven essential books. Awards The Pulitzer committee for fiction selected The Ghost Writer for the prize in 1980. The Pulitzer board, which has final say over awarding the prize, overrode their decision and chose Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Song instead. The book was also a finalist for the 1980 National Book Award.

Their decision was based on the political philosophy of republicanism as expressed by spokesmen such as Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Thomas Paine. They were opposed by the Loyalists who supported continued British rule. Patriots represented the spectrum of social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds. They included lawyers such as John Adams, students such as Alexander Hamilton, planters such as Thomas Jefferson and George Mason, merchants such as Alexander McDougall and John Hancock, and farmers such as Daniel Shays and Joseph Plumb Martin. They also included slaves and freemen such as Crispus Attucks, the first casualty of the American Revolution; James Armistead Lafayette, who served as a double agent for the Continental Army; and Jack Sisson, leader of the first successful black operation mission in American history under the command of Colonel William Barton, resulting in the capture of British General Richard Prescott. Terminology =\\"Whigs\\" or \\"Patriots\\"= The critics of British policy towards the colonies called themselves \\"Whigs\\" after 1768, identifying with members of the British Whig party who favored similar colonial policies. In Britain at the time, the word \\"patriot\\" had a negative connotation and was used as a negative epithet for \\"a factious disturber of the government\\", according to Samuel Johnson.\\"Patriot\\" in Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed. online 2011). accessed 19 December 2011. =\\"Tories\\" or \\"Royalists\\"= Prior to the Revolution, colonists who supported British authority called themselves Tories or royalists, identifying with the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism dominant in Great Britain. During the Revolution, these persons became known primarily as Loyalists. Afterward, some 15% of Loyalists emigrated north to the remaining British territories in Canada. There they called themselves the United Empire Loyalists. 85% of the Loyalists decided to stay in the new United States and were granted American citizenship. Influence Many Patriots were active before 1775 in groups such as the Sons of Liberty, and the most prominent leaders are referred to today by Americans as the Founding Fathers. They represented a cross-section of the population of the Thirteen Colonies and came from many different backgrounds. According to Robert Calhoon, between 40 and 45 percent of the white population in the Thirteen Colonies supported the Patriots' cause, between 15 and 20 percent supported the Loyalists, and the remainder were neutral or kept a low profile.Robert M. Calhoon, \\"Loyalism and neutrality\\" in The great majority of the Loyalists remained in America, while the minority went to Canada, Britain, Florida, or the West Indies.Thomas B. Allen, Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War (2011) p. xviii Motivations =Patriot and Loyalist differences= Historians have explored the motivations that pulled men to one side or the other.On Patriots see Edwin G. Burrows and Michael Wallace, \\"The American Revolution: The Ideology and Psychology of National Liberation,\\" Perspectives in American History, (1972) vol. 6 pp. 167–306 Yale historian Leonard Woods Labaree used the published and unpublished writings and letters of leading men on each side, searching for how personality shaped their choice. He finds eight characteristics that differentiated the two groups. Loyalists were older, better established, and more likely to resist innovation than the Patriots. Loyalists felt that the Crown was the legitimate government and resistance to it was morally wrong, while the Patriots felt that morality was on their side because the British government had violated the constitutional rights of Englishmen. Men who were alienated by physical attacks on Royal officials took the Loyalist position, while those who were offended by heavy-handed British response to actions such as the Boston Tea Party became Patriots. Merchants in the port cities with long-standing financial attachments to Britain were likely to remain loyal to the system, while few Patriots were so deeply enmeshed in the system. Some Loyalists, according to Labaree, were \\"procrastinators\\" who believed that independence was bound to come some day, but wanted to \\"postpone the moment\\", while the Patriots wanted to \\"seize the moment\\". Loyalists were cautious and afraid of anarchy or tyranny that might come from mob rule; Patriots made a systematic effort to take a stand against the British government. Finally, Labaree argues that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the Patriots' confidence that independence lay ahead.Leonard Woods Labaree, Conservatism in Early American History (1948) pp. 164–65See also N. E. H. Hull, Peter C. Hoffer and Steven L. Allen, \\"Choosing Sides: A Quantitative Study of the Personality Determinants of Loyalist and Revolutionary Political Affiliation in New York,\\" Journal of American History, 65#2 (1978), pp. 344–66 in JSTOR =Patriots and taxes= The Patriots rejected taxes imposed by legislatures in which the taxpayer was not represented. \\"No taxation without representation\\" was their slogan, referring to the lack of representation in the British Parliament. The British countered that there was \\"virtual representation\\" in the sense that all members of Parliament represented the interests of all the citizens of the British Empire. Some Patriots declared that they were loyal to the king, but they insisted that they should be free to run their own affairs. In fact, they had been running their own affairs since the period of \\"salutary neglect\\" before the French and Indian War. Some radical Patriots tarred and feathered tax collectors and customs officers, making those positions dangerous; according to Benjamin Irvin, the practice was especially prevalent in Boston where many Patriots lived.Benjamin H.

Her exact date of birth wasn't recorded, but she certainly was born in late 1247 or early 1248, because her father, who financially supported the Monastery of Santa María de Sigena, stipulates in his will dated in January 1248 that if he had another son, he should become a knight Templar and if the child was a daughter, she should enter at Santa María de Sigena as a nun. The will certainly was abandoned before Isabella's birth because she was married. On 11 May 1258, was concluded the Treaty of Corbeil between the Kings Louis IX of France and James I of Aragon; as a part of the agreement was arranged the betrothal between the French prince Philip —second son of Louis IX— and Isabella —youngest daughter of James I—.Gérard Sivéry, Philippe III le Hardi, 2003, Fayard, p. 35. The formal wedding took place on 28 May 1262 at the city of Clairmont (currently Clermont-Ferrand); at the time, Prince Philip was already the heir of the French throne after the death of his older brother Louis in 1260. The union produced four sons: #Louis (1264 –1276), heir of the French throne from 1270 until his death. #Philip IV \\"the Fair\\" (1268 –1314), King of France #Robert (1269 –1271). #Charles, Count of Valois (1270 –1325). Having accompanied her husband and father-in-law to the Eighth Crusade against Tunis in July 1270, Isabella became Queen consort of France the following month on the death of King Louis IX. On their way home, while crossing the Savuto river near Martirano in Calabria, on 11 January 1271 she suffered a fall from her horse: six months pregnant with her fifth child, she gave birth prematurely a son, who died soon after. First transported to Martirano Castle and then to Cosenza, exhausted and feverish, Isabella died there on 28 January 1271 aged 24. Her death was a devastating emotional blow to her husband, especially since she had been pregnant. Because she died far from her homeland, the funeral technique of Mos Teutonicus was practiced upon Isabella.Alain Erlande-Brandenburg, Le roi est mort.

Isabella's tomb, like many others, was desecrated during the French Revolution in August 1793. The tragic end of Isabella is recalled in the Laudi of the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio.

This was one of the many residences of Mahatma Gandhi who lived at Sabarmati (Gujarat) and Sevagram (Wardha, Maharashtra) when he was not travelling across India or in prison. He lived in Sabarmati or Wardha for a total of twelve years with his wife Kasturba Gandhi and followers, including Vinoba Bhave. The Bhagavad Gita was recited here daily as part of the Ashram schedule. It was from his base here that Gandhi led the Dandi march also known as the Salt Satyagraha on 12 March 1930. In recognition of the significant influence that this march had on the Indian independence movement the Indian government has established the ashram as a national monument. History Mahatma Gandhi's Visitor Room at Hridaya Kunj Kunj, at Sabarmati Ashram Gandhiji's India ashram was originally established at the Kocharab Bungalow of Jivanlal Desai, a barrister and friend of Gandhi, on 25 May 1915. At that time the ashram was called the Satyagraha Ashram. But Gandhi wanted to carry out various activities such as farming and animal husbandry, in addition to other pursuits which called for the need of a much larger area of usable land. So two years later, on 17 June 1917, the ashram was relocated to an area of thirty-six acres on the banks of the river Sabarmati, and it came to be known as the Sabarmati Ashram. It is believed that this is one of the ancient ashram sites of Dadhichi Rishi who had donated his bones for a righteous war. His main ashram lies in Naimisharanya, near Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The Sabarmati ashram is sited between a prison and a crematorium, and Gandhi believed that a satyagrahi has invariably to go to either place. Mohandas Gandhi said, \\"This is the right place for our activities to carry on the search for truth and develop fearlessness, for on one side are the iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts of Mother Nature.\\" While at the ashram, Gandhi formed a tertiary school that focused on manual labour, agriculture and literacy, in order to advance his efforts for the nation's self-sufficiency. It was also from here that on 12 March 1930, Gandhi marched to Dandi, 241 miles from the ashram, with 78 companions in protest at the British Salt Law, which increased the taxes on Indian salt in an effort to promote sales of British salt in India. It was this march and the subsequent illegal production of salt (Gandhi boiled up some salty mud in seawater) that spurred hundreds of thousands across India to join in, either in the illegal production, buying or selling of salt. This mass civil disobedience in turn led to the imprisioning of some 60,000 by the British Raj over the following three weeks. Subsequently, the government seized the ashram. Gandhi later asked the Government to give it back but they were unwilling. He had by then already decided on 22 July 1933 to disband the ashram, which then became a deserted place after the detention of so many. Then local citizens decided to preserve it. On 12 March 1930 Gandhi had vowed that he would not return to the ashram until India had gained independence. Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948. Present day Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya The ashram now has a museum, the Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya. This had originally been located in Hridaya Kunj, Gandhi's own cottage in the ashram. Then in 1963, having been designed by the architect Charles Correa, the museum was built. The Sangrahalaya was then re-located into the well- designed and well-furnished museum building and was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India on 10 May 1963. Memorial activities could then continue. Many buildings in the Ashram have names. There is a rich history of Gandhi's naming practices. At least some of the names of the buildings in the ashram, such as Nandini, and Rustom Block date back to the nineteen twenties, as is evident in a letter Gandhi wrote to Chhaganlal Joshi, the Ashram‘s new manager after Maganlal Gandhi‘s death in April 1928 Venugopal Maddipati, Selfsame Spaces: Gandhi, Architecture and Allusions in 20th century India, PhD. dissertation, University of Minnesota, https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/108181. Some of the names of the buildings and sites within the ashram are: *Nandini: This is an old ashram guest house where visitors from India and abroad are accommodated. It is situated on the right hand side of Hridaya Kunj. *Vinoba Kutir: This cottage is named after Acharya Vinoba Bhave who stayed here. Today It is also known as Mira Kutir after Gandhiji's disciple Mirabehn who later lived there, following Gandhi's principles. She was the daughter of a British Rear-Admiral. *Upasana Mandir: This is an open-air prayer ground, where after Prayers Gandhiji would refer to individual's questions and as head of family would try to analyse and solve these queries. It is situated between Hridaya Kunj and Magan Nivas. *Magan Niwas: This hut used to be the home of the ashram manager, Maganlal Gandhi. Maganlal was the cousin of Gandhi who he called the soul of the ashram.

The character was portrayed by Larry Hagman from the series premiere in 1978 until his death in late 2012, and Hagman was the only actor who appeared in all 357 episodes of the original series. As the show's most famous character, J.R. has been central to many of the series' biggest storylines. He is depicted as a covetous, egocentric, manipulative and amoral oil baron with psychopathic tendencies,Patrick, Christopher J. (2007). Handbook of Psychopathy, Guilford Pubn., New York who is constantly plotting subterfuges to plunder his foes' wealth. In the PBS series Pioneers of Television, Hagman claimed the character of J.R. began its development when he played a similar character in the film Stardust, and that he was also inspired by a mean boss he once had. The original series' concept was a blend of Bonanza (a rich Western patriarch and his three dissimilar sons), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (rival brothers, and their scheming wives), and Romeo and Juliet (two star-crossed lovers whose families are sworn enemies). The focus of the series was initially the feuding families, with J.R. just a supporting character, but his popularity grew and the producers acknowledged he became the breakout character. Two highly rated 1980 episodes became part of a cultural phenomenon that year known as \\"Who shot J.R.?\\". In \\"A House Divided\\", the audience witnessed J.R. being shot by an unknown assailant. After the cliffhanger was broadcast in March, the audience had to wait until the November conclusion, \\"Who Done It\\". With his new-found popularity, Larry Hagman threatened to leave the series unless his contractual demands were met. CBS leaked rumors of recasting, but the actor eventually prevailed. He also appeared in five episodes of spin-off series Knots Landing between 1980 and 1982. The character is featured in the first two seasons of the 2012 reincarnation series as well. Hagman died on November 23, 2012, and Dallas producers subsequently announced that J.R. would be killed off in the second season.Funeral Episode Set for Larry Hagman's J.R. on 'Dallas' Season Two Hollywood.com, December 11, 2012 The episode \\"The Furious and Fast\\" dealt with J.R.'s death. J.R. Ewing is considered one of television's most popular characters, with TV Guide naming him #1 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.Bretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). \\"Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time\\". TV Guide. pp. 14–15. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him #11 of their \\"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\\". In a 2001 Channel 4 poll in the U.K. he was ranked 38th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.  Character  J.R. has a reputation with his fellow characters, and viewers of the show, as a 'bad man'. He thinks nothing of resorting to bribery and blackmail to get his way and appears heartless much of the time - indeed taking pride in his nefarious nature. However, there are several instances throughout the original series' run where a more sympathetic and complex side to his character is portrayed, such as evidence of his love for his family. Also in the final season, there are glimpses of a depressive and contemplative nature when musing to Bobby during their cattle drive about how times were changing.  Storylines  = Original series = J.R. Ewing was the eldest son of John Ross \\"Jock\\" Ewing Sr. (Jim Davis) and Eleanor \\"Miss Ellie\\" Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes, briefly Donna Reed). J.R. was born on the family's Southfork Ranch.Dallas: The Early Years The year of his birth is inconsistent: in Dallas: The Early Years, Miss Ellie announces her pregnancy with J.R. in 1936, making the year of his birth 1936 or at the latest 1937, while in the 2012 continuation of Dallas, J.R.'s gravestone gives his birth year as 1939. J.R. has two younger brothers, Gary (Ted Shackelford, briefly David Ackroyd) and Bobby (Patrick Duffy); a half-brother, Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly), from his father's affair with an Army nurse named Margaret Hunter during World War II. Starting at age five, J.R. was groomed to be the heir apparent to his father Jock at Ewing Oil, an independent oil company that Jock ran in a very cutthroat, ruthless manner. After coming home from serving for a short time in the Vietnam War during the 1960s, J.R. began his long tenure as an employee of Ewing Oil. He had no interest working on Southfork Ranch, which was mostly the domain of his mother Miss Ellie, and brothers Bobby and Ray Krebbs, but he did have a strong desire to keep Southfork in the family. Gary was mostly influenced by his mother and embraced the Southworth tradition of ranching on Southfork and had no interest in Ewing Oil. Like their father Jock, J.R. saw Gary as weak, lacking the Ewing character and growing up Gary was unable to stand up to J.R.'s bullying. A teenage Gary met his wife Valene Clements (Joan Van Ark) in the early 1960s, they married when she became pregnant with their daughter Lucy (Charlene Tilton). J.R. did not approve of Gary marrying someone of Valene's status. When their marriage began to disintegrate, Gary left Southfork leaving Valene and Lucy. When Valene attempted to leave with Lucy, J.R. had her run out of town and took Lucy back to live with the Ewings at Southfork. In 1979, Gary and Valene reunited in Dallas and remarried, but rather than try to live at Southfork again, they left to go and live in the Californian suburb of Knots Landing. Bobby spent his time alternating between Southfork and Ewing Oil, and was Jock's favorite son. This made J.R. enormously determined to impress Jock, but despite his huge success in the oil business, J.R. was never able to overcome Jock's favoritism for Bobby. This led to a major rift between them in childhood that continued as they grew up, especially when Bobby married Pamela Barnes (Victoria Principal, briefly Margaret Michaels), who was a member of the Ewings' rival family. The legendary Barnes-Ewing feud began in the 1930s between Jock and Pam's stepfather Digger (Keenan Wynn, originally David Wayne) after their partnership in the oil business dissolved and Jock married Digger's childhood sweetheart. The feud continued with J.R. and Digger's son Cliff (Ken Kercheval). In 1971, J.R. married Sue Ellen Shepard (Linda Gray), a former \\"Miss Texas\\". Their marriage became increasingly turbulent with J.R. ignoring her first with Ewing Oil then philandering with other women. By the late 1970s Sue Ellen had become an alcoholic. They divorced in 1981 only to remarry in 1982 and divorce again in 1988. In 1989 Sue Ellen moves to London with her new lover Don Lockwood (Ian McShane), they marry in 1991. J.R. had two wives and three children during the show's run. His eldest son, James Richard Beaumont (Sasha Mitchell), was by an off-screen affair with Vanessa Beaumont (Gayle Hunnicutt) which occurred in the 1960s but was only brought to knowledge in 1989. His second and most favored son was John Ross Ewing III (Omri Katz) from his first wife Sue Ellen, born in 1979. His third son was with his second wife Cally (Cathy Podewell) born in 1991, however, Cally didn't give birth until after leaving Dallas. J.R. also initially believed he was the father of Christopher Ewing (Joshua Harris, originally Eric Farlow), the son of his sister-in-law and former mistress Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby), but it was later revealed J.R. was not the father. Christopher was adopted by Bobby and Pam. In addition to that, J.R.'s second wife Cally and his illegitimate son James successfully plotted to have him to be locked in a sanatorium for several months, which was the start of what would eventually be a year where J.R. lost everything. First, he lost control of Ewing Oil to Cliff, then was fired at West Star Oil by a vengeful Carter McKay (George Kennedy). To top it all off, he lost control of Southfork and was disowned by his son who moved to Europe to be with Sue Ellen. All J.R. was left with was a room in Southfork that Bobby let him stay in and not much else. Contemplating suicide, the character roamed the lonely Southfork with a bottle of bourbon and a loaded revolver. After an It's a Wonderful Life-like fantasy, J.R. is shown what life would have been like had he never been born. The series ended with a single gunshot and Bobby dashing into J.R.'s room, uttering \\"Oh my God!\\" at what he found. J.R.'s fate was not revealed. The \\"Conundrum\\" cliffhanger was not resolved until 1996, with the first Dallas reunion movie, Dallas: J.R. Returns. It was revealed in the beginning of the movie that J.R. had not, in fact, shot himself, but had instead shot at the mirror where the demon Adam (Joel Grey) was appearing to him. The 2012 revival series does not follow the reunion film, but shows J.R. still alive. According to the Dallas Facebook page, J.R. had indeed shot the mirror, but unlike the Reunion film, he didn't flee to Europe to recover. = Dallas (2012) = J.R. returns in the 2012 revival of the series, which focuses on J.R.'s son John Ross Ewing III and Bobby's adopted son Christopher Ewing. To J.R.'s delight, John Ross has become a carbon copy of him, in that he is more focused on oil, money and power. As the series begins J.R. has spent the last few years in a nursing home, suffering from chronic depression and not speaking despite visits from Bobby. All the events of the two TV movies are ignored. Bobby visits and tells J.R. that all of their fights over Ewing Oil and Southfork changed him in ways he doesn't like and that he wants Christopher and John Ross to be a real family and not be like them always fighting. When John Ross eventually visits him on Bobby's suggestion, he says that Bobby plans to sell Southfork and give the money from the sale to Christopher to fund Christopher's renewable energy project. John Ross also tells J.R. that he discovered a 2 billion barrel oil reserve under Southfork but Bobby has blocked the drilling. J.R. finally rouses himself to help his son fight the attempts to block his drilling for oil on the ranch and tells John Ross that Bobby was always a fool. He reveals that he is working alongside Marta Del Sol, the daughter of an old friend of J.R.'s, who owns millions of acres of land. Marta is supposedly offering a partnership to Bobby but it's J.R. pulling the strings when Bobby signs Southfork to Marta's conservatory, it'll really be going to J.R. John Ross is really working alongside Marta, with J.R. seeing them together but not seeming to mind. J.R. surprises everyone by showing up at a family gathering (acting as an invalid by using a walker) and apologizing to Bobby and Sue Ellen for his past actions. He later goes to Mexico to see Marta's father, Carlos Del Sol, but he knows nothing of any deal. He then introduces his daughter only she's not the woman J.R. knows as Marta. Realizing he's been fooled, J.R. tells Del Sol he's made a mistake and bites out that Marta should meet his son as \\"he's a chip off the old block.\\" J.R. eventually succeeds in getting Southfork from Bobby and doesn't waste any time in beginning to drill for oil on Southfork. He also cuts John Ross out of the partnership. However, he does give his son power of attorney to run his business ventures. J.R. is forced to return ownership of Southfork to Bobby when J.R. and John Ross' Venezuelan investor, Vicente Cano, turns violent against the Ewings when the loan isn't repaid. J.R. and John Ross are given immunity and sign confessions against Cano, who is sent to prison. Bobby keeps a copy of J.R.'s confession and warns him that he will send J.R. to prison if he uses any more dirty tricks. John Ross' fiancée Elena Ramos discovers John Ross' role in the plot, she breaks up with him and returns to Christopher. The first season ends with John Ross and J.R. joining forces against Bobby, Christopher and Elena, who have apparently reunited as a couple. At the start of the second season, J.R. is mentoring John Ross in business and dirty tricks and they are plotting to take control of Ewing Energies. J.R. also plots against his old rival Cliff Barnes and his daughter Pamela Rebecca Barnes, who is pregnant with Christopher's twins and is having an affair with John Ross. Bobby asks for J.R.'s help to take down Harris Ryland when it's revealed Ryland kidnapped Bobby's stepdaughter Emma and let Bobby's wife Ann think her daughter was dead. J.R. assures Bobby that he will take Ryland down. In the episode \\"The Furious and the Fast\\", J.R. talks to John Ross by phone about a \\"master plan\\" to defeat Cliff Barnes and Harris Ryland and to help John Ross take control of Ewing Energies, saying it will be his \\"masterpiece\\" when somebody apparently walks into the room and shoots twice, killing him. J.R.'s memorial was held at the Dallas Petroleum Club where many guests from his past attended. J.R.'s favorite drink, bourbon and branch was served. Guests included J.R.'s half-brother Ray Krebbs, niece Lucy Ewing, brothers Gary Ewing and Bobby Ewing, ex-wives Sue Ellen Ewing and Cally Harper Ewing, ex-mistress Mandy Winger, adopted nephew Christopher Ewing, Elena Ramos and her brother Drew Ramos and J.R.'s son John Ross Ewing III. Other notable guests included Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. J.R.'s funeral was held at the family cemetery plot on Southfork Ranch. Ray, Lucy, Gary, Christopher, Elena, Sue Ellen, and Bobby all spoke. J.R. was buried next to the graves of Jock and Miss Ellie. At his funeral, Sue Ellen read the letter that J.R. had written to her before he was murdered where he stated that he wanted another chance with her. Sue Ellen referred to J.R. as \\"the love of my life\\". Since J.R. had been a war veteran, his coffin was draped in a U.S. Stars and Stripes flag and was handed folded to John Ross because he was his son and next-of-kin. At the end of the funeral J.R.'s private investigator Bum Jones arrives at the gravesite. In the office at Southfork, Bum tells Bobby, John Ross, and Christopher that J.R. was in Abu Dhabi closing a deal to buy some oil leases but that his real reason for being in Abu Dhabi was because for the last several months he was trying to find Christopher's adoptive mother and Bobby's ex-wife Pamela Barnes Ewing. Bum gives Christopher some papers that would tell why it was important for Christopher to find Pam. Bum reveals that J.R. was in Nuevo Laredo following a lead to take down Harris Ryland using the quail hunt as a cover story. John Ross assumes that Ryland was behind his father's murder but Bum says that J.R. was killed by a random mugger. John Ross is given a box containing a pistol and a note from J.R. telling John Ross that now that he is dead, Cliff Barnes and Ryland will join forces to take down the Ewings. The note also says John Ross should use the contents of the box \\"to take from them what they want to take from us\\" and that afterwards \\"Bobby will know what to do.\\" J.R. ends the note by telling John Ross not to forget that he is J.R.'s son \\"from tip to tail\\". Bum gives a letter to Bobby. Bobby reads the letter but doesn't reveal what it says and tells John Ross and Christopher that it is between J.R. and him for the time being. Bobby and Bum talk outside the office where Bobby tells Bum to pay off whoever he has to in order to make everyone believe that J.R. was killed by a mugger and when the time is right the Ewings will handle the situation as a family. Bobby goes to J.R.'s bedroom and drinks some of J.R.'s trademark bourbon. Bobby, imagining talking to J.R., says that he knew J.R. would have one final card to play and it was a good one. Bobby says he loves J.R. and he breaks down crying. Bobby, John Ross and Christopher continue working together on the plan and they realise how important it is to find Pam, because she owns one-third of Barnes Global shares along with Katherine and Cliff. With Katherine dead it only leaves her. It was said she entered Abu Dhabi with her husband in 1989. Bobby finally reveals that J.R's master plan was to frame Cliff for his death \\"from beyond the grave\\". He reveals that J.R., knowing that he only had days to live from terminal cancer, had Bum steal Cliff's pistol. J.R. knew that Cliff went to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico every year for a fishing competition. J.R. had Bum meet him there and kill him. His plan was to have the Ewing family plant the pistol and J.R.'s trademark belt buckle in Cliff's car and safety deposit box.  Reunion movies  Two Dallas reunion TV movies were produced in the 1990s. Though these movies, at the time, continued the story of Dallas, they were later discarded for continuity purposes when the 2012 Dallas revival series was launched. In the first reunion movie, Dallas: J.R. Returns (1996), it was revealed that J.R. had shot the mirror in front of him and moved away to Europe for a few years. He returned and attempted to take back his empire, succeeding to an extent as he drove Cliff Barnes out of Ewing Oil, returning it to Bobby. J.R. was also elected chairman of West Star Oil, a feat he had spent almost fifteen years fighting to achieve. A second reunion movie, Dallas: War of the Ewings (1998), saw J.R. as CEO of West Star, try and fail to force a merger with Ewing Oil, but he did claim the consolation of conning $50,000,000 from Carter McKay.  Cars  J.R. initially drove a green 1978 280SE Mercedes-Benz, later replaced by a 1979 Reseda Green Mercedes Benz 450SEL. In 1981, he drove the \\"new\\" W126 380SEL, also in Reseda Green. In 1983 when his wife Sue Ellen wrecked the car at the end of the Southfork driveway, J.R. replaced it with another 1983 Mercedes Benz 380SEL. In 1984, Mercedes-Benz changed the flagship S-Class model to the 500SEL, J.R. then replaced the 380 with one of these. Finally, J.R. drove a facelifted W126 560SEL beginning the 1986 season. J.R. also occasionally drove a Cadillac Allanté convertible from 1987–91. In J.R. Returns, J.R. drives the 500SEL yet again for the first portion of the film. However, this vehicle is totaled and replaced with an updated silver 1996 Mercedes-Benz W140 S420 sedan. In War of the Ewings, J.R. is driving a silver 1998 SL500 Roadster. All of J.R.'s vehicles had the personalized license plate \\"EWING 3\\".  Legacy  * In 1999 TV Guide ranked him number 11 on its \\"50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\\" list.

An example is sodium phosphate, Na3PO4. The sodium ion has a charge of 1+ and the phosphate ion has a charge of 3-. Therefore, three sodium ions are needed to balance the charge of one phosphate ion. Another example of a ternary compound is calcium carbonate, CaCO3. In naming and writing the formulae for ternary compounds, rules are similar to binary compounds. According to Rustum Roy and Olaf Müller,Rustum Roy & Olaf Müller (1974) The Major Ternary Structural Families, Springer-Verlag \\"the chemistry of the entire mineral world informs us that chemical complexity can easily be accommodated within structural simplicity.\\" The example of zircon is cited, where various metal atoms are replaced in the same crystal structure. \\"The structural entity ... remains ternary in character and is able to accommodate an enormous range of chemical elements.\\" The great variety of ternary compounds is therefore reduced to relatively few structures: \\"By dealing with approximately ten ternary structural groupings we can cover the most important structures of science and technology specific to the non-metallics world. It is a remarkable instance of nature's simplexity.\\" Letting A and B represent cations and X an anion, these ternary groupings are organized by stoichiometric types A2BX4, ABX4, and ABX3. A ternary compound of type A2BX4 may be in the class of olivine, the spinel group, or phenakite. Examples include K2NiF4, β-K2SO4, and CaFe2O4. One of type ABX4 may be of the class of zircon, scheelite, barite or an ordered silicon dioxide derivative. In the ABX3 class of ternary compounds, there are the structures of perovskite (structure), calcium carbonate, pyroxenes, corundum and hexagonal ABX2 types. Other ternary compounds are described as crystals of types ABX2, A2B2X7, ABX5, A2BX6, and A3BX5. In organic chemistry, the carbohydrates and carboxylic acids are ternary compounds with carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Other organic ternary compounds replace oxygen with another atom to form functional groups.

He was first elected to Congress in 2004 and represented the district from 2005 to 2007, but he was defeated by Democrat Patrick Murphy in 2006. He declined to run for his old seat in 2008 but ran again in 2010, and won a rematch with Murphy. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. A supporter of term limits, he did not seek re-election in 2016 and was replaced by his brother Brian. He was considered a moderate Republican, and consistently ranked among the most bipartisan members of Congress. Early life, education and law career Fitzpatrick was born in Philadelphia and raised in Bucks County. He graduated from Bishop Egan High School, now Conwell-Egan Catholic High School, in Fairless Hills. He moved to Florida to attend St. Thomas University with an academic scholarship where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1985 from the school's honors program. He earned his J.D. degree from the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State University. He was named business manager of the Dickinson Journal of International Law. After graduating law school in 1988, Fitzpatrick was admitted to the practice of law in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Bucks County Commission (1995–2005) In January 1995, Fitzpatrick was appointed to the Bucks County Board of Commissioners by an 11-member panel of county judges. The appointment was made to fill the unexpired term of Mark Schweiker, who had been elected lieutenant governor. Fitzpatrick, who was an attorney at a firm active in county affairs, was the candidate preferred by county Republican Party leaders. The appointment was not without controversy, however, as some claimed the judges had acted solely on the recommendation of the county Republican Party. As Commissioner, Fitzpatrick oversaw social agencies, coordinated the response of local governments to emergencies, preserved open space, and responded to regional issues. Fitzpatrick supported a $7 million information-technology project to upgrade the county's communication and outreach abilities in light of the Information Age. U.S. House of Representatives (2005–2007) =Elections= ;2004 In July 2004, popular moderate Republican James C. Greenwood unexpectedly withdrew from his re-election campaign. In the party convention held to select Greenwood's replacement on the ballot, the more conservative Fitzpatrick won the nomination over Greenwood's choice, state Senator Joe Conti, thanks to the backing of Bucks County Republican Party boss Harry Fawkes. Fitzpatrick went on to face liberal activist Virginia Schrader in the general election.Doylestown Patriot \\\\–- Schrader responds to Greenwood's retirement , zwire.com; accessed November 10, 2016. Fitzpatrick won the general election against Schrader 55%–44%, with the remaining vote split between two minor candidates. The Pennsylvania 8th District includes all of Bucks County, a sliver of Montgomery County, and parts of two wards in Northeast Philadelphia. ;2006 Fitzpatrick faced Democrat Patrick Murphy in the November general election of 2006. In January 2006, Fitzpatrick said he had donated to charity the $21,500 he received from political action committees headed by U.S. Representatives Bob Ney (R-OH), Tom DeLay, (R-TX), and Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham (R-CA). Fitzpatrick was endorsed by several environmental groups including the Sierra Club. He was the only incumbent Republican congressman in Pennsylvania who had the support of the environmentalist lobby during this election. The Cook Political Report rated the race as \\"Leans Republican\\". However, Congressional Quarterly pegged the contest as a \\"Toss-up\\". A poll released at the end of October showed Fitzpatrick trailing Murphy by three percentage points. In the end, the election was decided by less than one percentage point, with Fitzpatrick initially trailing by just over 1,500 votes out of nearly 250,000 cast. On November 8, with all precincts reporting, Murphy led by 1,521 votes. Philadelphia television station NBC 10 later reported that Fitzpatrick had conceded the election to Murphy.NBC10.com. Fitzpatrick Concedes Defeat , November 8, 2006. He along with Mike Sodrel (R-IN) and Joe Schwarz (R-MI) were the only freshman Republicans to be defeated in 2006 (Schwarz in the primary). Tenure In May 2006, Fitzpatrick introduced the Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006, which requires most schools and libraries to actively restrict minors from access to \\"Commercial Social Networking Websites\\" and \\"Chat Rooms\\". In late July, the \\"DOPA Act\\" overwhelmingly passed the House. Speaking before the vote was taken, Fitzpatrick said, \\"The social networking sites have become, in a sense, a happy hunting ground for child predators\\". Committee assignments Fitzpatrick served on the United States House Committee on Financial Services and the United States House Committee on Small Business. Inter-congressional career (2007–2011) After the loss to Murphy, Fitzpatrick re-entered the practice of law, taking a position with Middletown Township law firm—and major Republican Party contributor—Begley, Carlin, and Mandio.Profile , begleycarlin.com; accessed November 10, 2016.Pay to play not a given in Bucks , phillyBurbs.com; accessed November 10, 2016. In the fall of 2007, the Bucks County Commissioners asked Fitzpatrick, along with former Commissioner Andy Warren and former Common Pleas Judge William Hart Rufe to co-chair an effort to pass a ballot initiative authorizing the county to borrow $87 million for open space preservation.Big push for open space support, phillyBurbs.com; accessed November 10, 2016. The initiative, which was also endorsed by Congressman Murphy, passed by a large margin. ;2008 Throughout 2007, there was much speculation that Fitzpatrick would seek to reclaim the seat in Congress that he lost to Murphy. Fitzpatrick laid the rumors to rest in January 2008 by announcing that he would not be running for Congress, but instead would challenge freshman State Representative Chris King in the 142nd District. Despite charges by some Democrats that he was \\"afraid to run against Murphy because he knows he would lose\\", Fitzpatrick claimed that he was interested in the job because of his \\"passion ... in solving local problems and serving the local community\\", as well as a desire to \\"change the way business is done in Harrisburg.\\"Fitzpatrick to run for state House , phillyBurbs.com; accessed November 10, 2016. However, a cancer diagnosis forced Fitzpatrick to end his bid for the State House in early February. Fitzpatrick yielded his spot on the ballot to Republican activist Frank Farry (who went on to win the seat), and supported Doylestown pharmaceutical company executive Thomas Manion for the congressional seat he once held. U.S. House of Representatives (2011–2017) =Elections= ;2010 On January 23, 2010, Fitzpatrick announced he would once again run for his old seat in the House of Representatives. He pledged that if elected, he would only serve for a maximum of three more terms, for a total of four terms. He described Washington, D.C. as \\"a town of embedded politicians\\" with a seniority system that \\"rewards congressmen for political careers lasting decades and encourages members to serve in perpetuity.\\" He called for \\"real reform of house rules and procedures\\" and \\"congressional term limits.\\" He won the Republican nomination with 77% of the vote in the May primary. A Franklin and Marshall poll taken in mid-September 2010 suggested the race was leaning towards Fitzpatrick at that time. On November 2, Fitzpatrick defeated Murphy and was elected the Congressman for the 8th district. On November 2, 2010, Fitzpatrick defeated Murphy by 53.5% to 46.5% to reclaim his old seat. He was sworn in on January 5, 2011 and has joined the Republican Main Street Partnership. ;2012 Fitzpatrick defeated Kathryn Boockvar 57%–43%. ;2014 Before the election, Fitzpatrick reiterated a pledge he made in 2010 that this will be his last re-election bid, due to self-imposed term limits. In the Democratic primary, former Army Ranger Kevin Strouse defeated businesswoman Shaughnessy Naughton. Fitzpatrick defeated Strouse in the general election. After he won, he again confirmed that he would not run for re-election in 2016. Fitzpatrick's younger brother, Brian, a lawyer and former FBI supervisory special agent in California, moved back to Pennsylvania to run for his brother's seat. Brian Fitzpatrick won the election on November 8, 2016. Tenure On January 5, 2011, Fitzpatrick failed to attend the swearing-in ceremony for members and attempted to take the oath-of-office remotely at a reception. However, House rules require that the oath be taken within proximity of the Speaker. The oath was administered the following day, but two votes that he cast prior to taking the oath were nullified according to the Constitution. Some activists contended the reception was a fundraiser and called for an investigation by the House Ethics Committee. A spokesperson for Fitzpatrick denied the event was a fundraiser and asserted that donations made went to cover the cost of campaign-provided buses to Washington. Fitzpatrick supported reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. On January 5, 2016, the House Committee on Financial Services reauthorized the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing with Fitzpatrick as Chairman and Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA) as Ranking Member. Over the course of a two-year period, the Task Force investigated the financial mechanisms used to fund terrorist activities, specifically the vulnerabilities of the global financial system, trade-based money laundering, assistance for developing world, and the sale and trafficking of illicit goods. Since December 2014, Fitzpatrick has been a leading voice in Congress on medical device safety. He has pressed the FDA after dangerous medical devices remained in use after causing serious injury and death. On June 8, 2016, Fitzpatrick and Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) introduced two bills to reform the medical device review and approval process. The first bill, Ariel Grace's Law, would allow victims of dangerous medical devices to seek legal recourse. The second bill, the Medical Device Guardians Act, would require physicians to identify and report unsafe medical devices and would protect them from having their reports used against them in a civil court. Fitzpatrick was ranked as the 10th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party). =Committee assignments= * Committee on Financial Services ** Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Vice Chair) ** Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing (Chair) Personal life and death Fitzpatrick and his wife Kathleen, a high school science teacher, lived in Levittown, Pennsylvania, with their six children. He was affiliated with the Washington Crossing Council of the Boy Scouts of America and was a member of the Temple Lower Bucks Hospital Board of Directors, the Conwell-Egan Catholic Board of Advisors, the Knights of Columbus, the Levittown Bristol Kiwanis Club, the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Brehon Law Society. He was an Eagle Scout from the Bucks County Council and former president of that council, and was honored with the Silver Beaver Award for his services to Scouting. Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with colon cancer in June 2008. He reported five months later that the cancer went into remission after chemotherapy. Fitzpatrick died from melanoma at his home in Levittown on January 6, 2020, at age 56.

Its name reflects its pareidolic resemblance to classical depictions of Gautama Buddha, seated in a meditation pose with a forehead mark (tikka), a traditional topknot (ushnisha) and ringlet hair. Discovery The Buddhabrot rendering technique was discovered by Melinda Green,Melinda Green. \\"The Buddhabrot Technique\\", superliminal.com. who later described it in a 1993 Usenet post to sci.fractals. Previous researchers had come very close to finding the precise Buddhabrot technique. In 1988, Linas Vepstas relayed similar images\\"Interior Sketchbook Diary\\", Linas.org. to Cliff Pickover for inclusion in Pickover's then-forthcoming book Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty. This led directly to the discovery of Pickover stalks. However, these researchers did not filter out non-escaping trajectories required to produce the ghostly forms reminiscent of Hindu art. The inverse, \\"Anti-Buddhabrot\\" filter produces images similar to no filtering. Green first named this pattern Ganesh, since an Indian co-worker \\"instantly recognized it as the god 'Ganesha' which is the one with the head of an elephant.\\"Daniel Green. \\"The deity hiding in the m-set\\", Groups.Google.com. The name Buddhabrot was coined later by Lori Gardi.Western News: The University of Western Ontario’s newspaper. Chaos (theory) rules for software developer. Rendering method Mathematically, the Mandelbrot set consists of the set of points c in the complex plane for which the iteratively defined sequence z_{n+1} = {z_n}^2 + c does tend to infinity as n goes to infinity for z_0 = 0.199x199pxThe Buddhabrot image can be constructed by first creating a 2-dimensional array of boxes, each corresponding to a final pixel in the image. Each box (i,j) for i =1,\\\\ldots,m and j = 1,\\\\ldots,n has size in complex coordinates of \\\\Delta x and \\\\Delta y, where \\\\Delta x = w/m and \\\\Delta y = h/n for an image of width w and height h. For each box, a corresponding counter is initialized to zero. Next, a random sampling of c points are iterated through the Mandelbrot function. For points which escape within a chosen maximum number of iterations, and therefore are not in the Mandelbrot set, the counter for each box entered during the escape to infinity is incremented by 1. In other words, for each sequence corresponding to c that escapes, for each point z_n during the escape, the box that (\\\\text{Re}(z_n), \\\\text{Im}(z_n)) lies within is incremented by 1. Points which do not escape within the maximum number of iterations (and considered to be in the Mandelbrot set) are discarded. After a large number of c values have been iterated, grayscale shades are then chosen based on the distribution of values recorded in the array. The result is a density plot highlighting regions where z_n values spend the most time on their way to infinity. Anti-Buddhabrot A Buddhabrot as the max iterations increases Nuances Rendering Buddhabrot images is typically more computationally intensive than standard Mandelbrot rendering techniques. This is partly due to requiring more random points to be iterated than pixels in the image in order to build up a sharp image. Rendering highly zoomed areas requires even more computation than for standard Mandelbrot images in which a given pixel can be computed directly regardless of zoom level. Conversely, a pixel in a zoomed region of a Buddhabrot image can be affected by initial points from regions far outside the one being rendered. Without resorting to more complex probabilistic techniques,http://www.steckles.com/buddha/ rendering zoomed portions of Buddhabrot consists of merely cropping a large full sized rendering. The maximum number of iterations chosen affects the image – higher values give sparser more detailed appearance, as a few of the points pass through a large number of pixels before they escape, resulting in their paths being more prominent. If a lower maximum was used, these points would not escape in time and would be regarded as not escaping at all. The number of samples chosen also affects the image as not only do higher sample counts reduce the noise of the image, they can reduce the visibility of slowly moving points and small attractors, which can show up as visible streaks in a rendering of lower sample count. Some of these streaks are visible in the 1,000,000 iteration image below. Green later realized that this provided a natural way to create color Buddhabrot images by taking three such grayscale images, differing only by the maximum number of iterations used, and combining them into a single color image using the same method used by astronomers to create false color images of nebula and other celestial objects. For example, one could assign a 2,000 max iteration image to the red channel, a 200 max iteration image to the green channel, and a 20 max iteration image to the blue channel of an image in an RGB color space. Some have labelled Buddhabrot images using this technique Nebulabrots. Relation to the logistic map The Buddhabrot and its logistic map. Animation depicting the Buddhabrot and its logistic map. The relationship between the Mandelbrot set as defined by the iteration z^2+c, and the logistic map \\\\lambda x(1-x) is well known. The two are related by the quadratic transformation: \\\\begin{align} c_r&=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda(2-\\\\lambda)}{4}\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_i&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_r&=-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda(2x-1)}{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_i&=0 \\\\end{align} The traditional way of illustrating this relationship is aligning the logistic map and the Mandelbrot set through the relation between c_r and \\\\lambda, using a common x-axis and a different y-axis, showing a one-dimensional relationship. Melinda Green discovered 'by accident' that the Anti-Buddhabrot paradigm fully integrates the logistic map. Both are based on tracing paths from non-escaping points, iterated from a (random) starting point, and the iteration functions are related by the transformation given above. It is then easy to see that the Anti-Buddhabrot for z^2+c, plotting paths with c=(\\\\text{random},0) and z_0=(0,0), simply generates the logistic map in the plane \\\\\\\\{c_r,z_r\\\\\\\\}, when using the given transformation. For rendering purposes we use z_0=(\\\\text{random},0). In the logistic map, all z_{r0} ultimately generate the same path. Because both the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map are an integral part of the Anti-Buddhabrot we can now show a 3D relationship between both, using the 3D axes \\\\\\\\{c_r,c_i,z_r\\\\\\\\}. The animation shows the classic Anti-Buddhabrot with c=(\\\\text{random},\\\\text{random}) and z_0=(0,0), this is the 2D Mandelbrot set in the plane \\\\\\\\{c_r,c_i\\\\\\\\}, and also the Anti-Buddhabrot with c=(\\\\text{random},0) and z_0=(0,0), this is the 2D logistic map in the plane \\\\\\\\{c_r,z_r\\\\\\\\}. We rotate the plane \\\\\\\\{c_i,z_r\\\\\\\\} around the c_r-axis, first showing \\\\\\\\{c_r,c_i\\\\\\\\}, then rotating 90° to show \\\\\\\\{c_r,z_r\\\\\\\\}, then rotating an extra 90° to show \\\\\\\\{c_r,-c_i\\\\\\\\}. We could rotate an extra 180° but this gives the same images, mirrored around the c_r-axis. The logistic map Anti-Buddhabrot is in fact a subset of the classic Anti-Buddhabrot, situated in the plane \\\\\\\\{c_r,z_r\\\\\\\\} (or c_i=0) of 3D \\\\\\\\{c_r,c_i,z_r\\\\\\\\}, perpendicular to the plane \\\\\\\\{c_r,c_i\\\\\\\\}. We emphasize this by showing briefly, at 90° rotation, only the projected plane c_i=0, not 'disturbed' by the projections of the planes with non-zero c_i.

Hyder Ali and his successor Tipu Sultan fought a war on four fronts with the British attacking from the west, south and east, while the Nizam's forces attacked from the north. The fourth war resulted in the overthrow of the house of Hyder Ali and Tipu (who was killed in the fourth war, in 1799), and the dismantlement of Mysore to the benefit of the East India Company, which took control of much of the Indian subcontinent. Hyder Ali in 1762, incorrectly described as \\"Commander in Chief of the Marathas. At the head of his army in the war against the British in India\\". (French painting) First Anglo-Mysore War The First Anglo-Mysore War (1767–69) saw Hyder Ali enjoy some measure of success against the British, almost capturing Madras. The British convinced the Nizam of Hyderabad to attack Hyder. That was temporary, however, and the Nizam signed a new treaty with the British in February 1768. Hyder Ali had to contend with a British Bombay army attacking on the west and a Madras army attacking from the northeast. However, Hyder's attack towards Madras resulted in the Madras government suing for peace, and the resultant Treaty of Madras. Second Anglo-Mysore War The Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780–84) witnessed bloodier battles with fortunes fluctuating between the contesting powers. Tipu defeated Baillie at the Battle of Pollilur in Sept. 1780, and Braithwaite at Kumbakonam in Feb. 1782, both of whom were taken prisoner to Seringapatam. This war saw the rise of Sir Eyre Coote, the British commander who defeated Hyder Ali at the Battle of Porto Novo and Arni. Tipu continued the war following his father's death. Finally, the war ended with the signing of a treaty on 11 March 1784, the Treaty of Mangalore, which restored the status quo ante bellum. The Treaty of Gajendragad in April 1787 ended the conflict with the Marathas. Third Anglo-Mysore War In the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790–92), Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore and an ally of France, invaded the nearby state of Travancore in 1789 which was a British ally. British forces were commanded by Governor-General Cornwallis himself. The resultant war lasted three years and was a resounding defeat for Mysore. The war ended after the 1792 Siege of Seringapatam and the signing of the Treaty of Seringapatam, according to which Tipu had to surrender half of his kingdom to the British East India Company and its allies. Fourth Anglo Mysore War The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798–99) saw the death of Tipu Sultan and further reductions in Mysorean territory. Mysore's alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the East India Company and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. Tipu's army was outnumbered 4:1 in this war. Mysore had 35,000 soldiers, whereas the British commanded 60,000 troops. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the Siege of Seringapatam (1799). Tipu was killed during the defence of the city. Much of the remaining Mysorean territory was annexed by the British, the Nizam and the Marathas. The remaining core, around Mysore and Seringapatam, was restored to the Indian prince belonging to the Wodeyar dynasty, whose forefathers had been the actual rulers before Hyder Ali became the de facto ruler. The Wodeyars ruled the remnant state of Mysore until 1947, when it joined the Union of India. After the Battles of Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764), which established British dominion over East India, the Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766–1799), the Anglo–Maratha Wars (1775–1818), and finally the Anglo- Sikh Wars (1845–1849) consolidated the British claim over South Asia, resulting in the British Empire in India, though resistance among various groups such as the Afghans and the Burmese would last well into the 1880s. Rockets The Mysorean rockets used by Tipu Sultan during the Battle of Pollilur were much more advanced than any that the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant. This enabled higher thrust and a longer range for the missile (up to ). After Tipu Sultan's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of a number of Mysorean iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.Roddam Narasimha (1985).

Born in Leuven, Brabant, she was a daughter of Henry III, Duke of Brabant, and Adelaide of Burgundy.  Queen  Marie married the widowed Philip III of France on 21 August 1274. His first wife, Isabella of Aragon, had already given birth to three surviving sons: Louis, Philip and Charles. Philip was under the strong influence of his mother, Margaret of Provence, and his minion, surgeon and chamberlain (Chambellan) Pierre de La Broce. Not being French, Marie stood out at the French court. In 1276, Marie's stepson Louis died under suspicious circumstances. Marie was suspected of ordering him to be poisoned. La Brosse, who was also suspected, was imprisoned and later executed for the murder.  Queen dowager  After the death of Philip III in 1285, Marie lost some of her political influence, and dedicated her life to their three children: Louis (May 1276 – 19 May 1319), Blanche (1278 – 19 March 1305) and Margaret (died in 1318). Her stepson Philip IV was crowned king of France on 6 January 1286 in Reims. Together with Joan I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois, she negotiated peace in 1294 between England and France with Edmund Crouchback, the younger brother of Edward I of England. Marie lived through Philip IV's reign and she outlived her children. She died in 1322, aged 67, in the monastery at Les Mureaux, near Meulan, where she had withdrawn to in 1316. Marie was not buried in the royal necropolis of Basilica of Saint-Denis, but in the Cordeliers Convent, in Paris. Destroyed in a fire in 1580, the church was rebuilt in the following years.

U.S. Judge Learned Hand has described its purpose as being \\"to temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention\\".Royal Typewriter Co. v. Remington Rand, Inc., 168 F.2d 691, 692 (2d Cir. 1948). Standards for determining equivalents = Germany = German courts typically apply a three-step test known as Schneidmesser's questions.Schneidmesser II; GRUR 2002, p 513. Federal Court of Justice of Germany, March 12, 2002. These questions are: #Does the variant solve the problem underlying the invention with means that objectively have the same effect? #Would the person skilled in the art, using the common general knowledge, have realised at the priority date that the variant has the same effect? #Are the considerations which the skilled person takes into account for the variant in the light of the meaning of the invention close enough to the considerations taken into account for the literal solution protected by the claims, such that the skilled person will consider the variant as a solution which is equivalent to the literal one? All of the above questions need to be answered in the affirmative in order to demonstrate equivalent infringement. In addition, an allegation of equivalent infringement needs to withstand the Formstein test.Schneidmesser II; GRUR 1986, p 803. Federal Court of Justice of Germany, April 29, 1986. The corresponding question reads: :Does the variant, having regard to the state of the art, lack novelty or is the variant obvious to a person skilled in the art? = Ireland = Ireland appears to subscribe to a doctrine of equivalents. In Farbwerke Hoechst v Intercontinental Pharmaceuticals (Eire) Ltd (1968), a case involving a patent of a chemical process, the High Court found that the defendant had infringed the plaintiff's patent despite the fact that the defendant had substituted the starting material specified in the patent claim for another material. Expert evidence showed that any technician who failed to obtain a good result using the specified starting material would try the replacement material. The two materials were therefore held to be chemically equivalent, and the replacement of one with the other by the defendant did not prevent a finding and injunction against him. = Switzerland = On 21 March 2013, the Federal Patent Court of Switzerland adopted an approach similar to the three-prong test applied in Germany. The court based its decision on the three questions:Kontrazeptiva; GRUR Int 2014, p 543. Federal Patent Court of Switzerland, March 21, 2013. #Do the replaced features have the same objective function (same effect)? #Are the replaced features and their same objective function obvious to a person skilled in the art on the basis of the teaching of the patent (accessibility)? #After reading the wording of the claim in light of the description, would a person skilled in the art consider the replaced features as a solution of equal value (equal value)? The court denied equivalent infringement of EP0918791B3, since paragraph 19 of EP0918791B3 explicitly teaches that toxic chromium compounds may be replaced by metallic catalysts. A person skilled in the art would not consider the organic catalyst TEMPO as a solution of equal value to the ruthenium salts specified in claim 1. The answer to the third question was negative. The court also ruled that there was equivalent infringement of EP1149840B1, since all questions of the three-prong test were answered in the affirmative. The court set forth that the replacement of the claimed p-Toluenesulfonic acid with pyridine/water constituted basic knowledge taught during the first years of an undergraduate course in organic chemistry. In Urinal valve II,Patentverletzung durch Nachahmung; GRUR Int 1/2017, p 40. Federal Supreme Court, October 3, 2016. the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland basically affirmed the three-prong test applied by the Federal Patent Court. The Supreme Court still partly reversed the Federal Patent Court’s earlier ruling on case O2014_002. The Supreme Court contended (reasons 6.4) that a second embodiment of the urinal valve fully implemented the key teachings of the asserted patent EP1579133, even though the second embodiment was not literally covered by the wording of the relevant claim. The Court went on to establish equivalent infringement. = United Kingdom = The UK approach to infringement that does not fall within the literal wording of a patent claim has varied over the years. History Until the 1960s, an act could be considered infringing either if it fell within the literal wording of the claim (“textual infringement”), or was something that the courts considered to be a \\"mechanical equivalent\\". That wording was found to cause problems in some cases, and gradually the courts built up a complex body of case law whereby an act that was not a textual infringement could nevertheless be caught if the alleged infringer had taken what the courts came to call the \\"pith and marrow\\" of the invention. per Lord Cairns at 320 In 1963, Van der Lely v Bamfords was decided by the House of Lords. Their Lordships took the view that if the patentees had deliberately framed their claim in such way as to exclude the alleged infringing act, then they should be held to the wording they had chosen. The \\"pith and marrow\\" doctrine should not be applied so as to extend the scope of a carefully worded claim, and should in the future apply only to cases of \\"colourable evasion of patent claims\\". This much stricter approach to claim construction became open to review after 1977 when the UK joined the European Patent Convention (EPC). Under the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69, the Convention required the UK courts to maintain a balance between interpreting patent claims with strict literalism (the description and drawings being used only to resolve ambiguity) and regarding the claims as a mere guideline. In Catnic Components Ltd v Hill & Smith Ltd (1982) the House of Lords swept away all of the earlier case law on \\"mechanical equivalents” and \\"pith and marrow\\", and held that a patent specification should be given a “purposive construction” rather than a purely literal one. The question to be asked should be whether a skilled person reading the patent would understand that strict compliance with a word or phrase within the claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement, even if it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked. The specific questions used by the courts to achieve the required “purposive construction” settled into stable form with Improver v Remington (1990) and the House of Lords decision in Kirin-Amgen (2004). These so-called Improver (or Protocol) questions became a widely used three-step test for determining non-literal patent infringement. Current law In 2007 the EPC was revised as EPC 2000. This amended the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 to require the courts of all contracting states, including the UK, to take due account when considering infringement \\"of any element which is an equivalent to an element specified in the claims\\". In 2017, Lord Neuberger in Actavis UK v Eli Lilly held that the Protocol questions should be revised. The correct questions to ask when determining whether there has been non-literal infringement, according to the Supreme Court, should now be # \\"Notwithstanding that it is not within the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent, does the variant achieve substantially the same result in substantially the same way as the invention, ie the inventive concept revealed by the patent?\\" # \\"Would it be obvious to the person skilled in the art, reading the patent at the priority date, but knowing that the variant achieves substantially the same result as the invention, that it does so in substantially the same way as the invention?\\" # \\"Would such a reader of the patent have concluded that the patentee nonetheless intended that strict compliance with the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent was an essential requirement of the invention?\\" In order to establish infringement in a case where there is no literal infringement, a patentee must establish that the answer to the first two questions is “yes” and that the answer to the third is “no”. = United States = In the United States, the doctrine of equivalents analysis is applied to individual claim limitations, not to the invention as a whole.See Warner-Jenkinson Co. The legal test, articulated in Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co. (1997), is whether the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim is \\"insubstantial.\\" One way of determining whether a difference is \\"insubstantial\\" or not is called the \\"triple identity\\" test. Under the triple- identity test, the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim may be found to be \\"insubstantial\\" if the feature in the accused device: #Performs substantially the same function #In substantially the same way #To obtain the same result as the limitation literally recited in the patent claim. See Graver Tank & Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., (1950). The Court also explained that the doctrine of equivalents applies if two elements are interchangeable and a person with ordinary skill in the art would have known that the elements were interchangeable at the time of infringement. In the United States, the doctrine of equivalents is limited by prosecution history estoppel. Under prosecution history estoppel, if the patentee abandoned through an amendment to the patent application certain literal claim coverage (e.g., by narrowing the literal scope of the patent claim), then the patentee is estopped from later arguing that the surrendered coverage is insubstantially different from the literally claimed limitation.See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. The proposed equivalents also cannot cover, or ensnare, the prior art. Depuy Spine, Inc. v. Biedermann Motech GMBH (Fed. Cir. 2009) The United States also has a statutory equivalents doctrine that is codified in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6, which extends to structural equivalents. However, while the general doctrine of equivalents extends to technological equivalents developed after the issuance of a claim, the statutory structural equivalents in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6 extends only to equivalents available at issuance.  Harmonization attempts  Attempts have been made to harmonize the doctrine of equivalents. For instance, Article 21(2) of 1991 WIPO's \\"Basic Proposal\\" for a Treaty Supplementing the Paris Convention states: :\\"(a) (...) a claim shall be considered to cover not only all the elements as expressed in the claim but also equivalents. :(b) An element (\\"the equivalent element\\") shall generally be considered as being equivalent to an element as expressed in a claim if, at the time of any alleged infringement, either of the following conditions is fulfilled in regard to the invention as claimed: ::(i) the equivalent element performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way and produces substantially the same result as the element as expressed in the claim, or ::(ii) it is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the same result as that achieved by means of the element as expressed in the claim can be achieved by means of the equivalent element.\\" The EPC 2000, which came into effect on 13 December 2007, included an amended \\"Protocol on the interpretation of \\" intended to bring about uniformity at a national level between contracting states to the EPC when interpreting claims.\\"An Overview of the New European Patent Convention and its Potential Impact on European Patent Practice\\", S.J. Farmer and M. Grund, Bio-Science Law Review, Vol. 9, Issue 2, pages 53-61 The amended text reads: :For the purpose of determining the extent of protection conferred by a European patent, due account shall be taken of any element which is an equivalent to an element specified in the claims. However, no definition of what was meant by an \\"equivalent\\" was included in the Protocol and it is expected that this lack of a binding definition will do little to achieve the desired uniform interpretation.

A part of the evacuation of German civilians towards the end of World War II, these events are not to be confused with the expulsion from East Prussia that followed after the war had ended. The area that was evacuated was not the Gau East Prussia, but the inter-war East Prussia where most people already held German citizenship. German citizens in Memel and other regions with proximity to East Prussia also took part in the evacuation, wishing to escape by sea, even though in their regions there was no official evacuation announced. The evacuation, which had been delayed for months, was initiated due to fear of the Red Army advances during the East Prussian Offensive. Some parts of the evacuation were planned as a military necessity, Operation Hannibal being the most important military operation involved in the evacuation. However, many refugees took to the roads on their own initiative because of reported Soviet atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Both spurious and factual accounts of Soviet atrocities were disseminated through the official news and propaganda outlets of Nazi Germany and by rumors that swept through the military and civilian populations. Despite having detailed evacuation plans for some areas, the German authorities, including the Gauleiter of East Prussia, Erich Koch, delayed action until 20 January, when it was too late for an orderly evacuation, and the civil services and Nazi Party were eventually overwhelmed by the numbers of those wishing to evacuate. Coupled with the panic caused by the speed of the Soviet advance, civilians caught in the middle of combat, and the bitter winter weather, many thousands of refugees died during the evacuation period. The Soviet forces took control of East Prussia only in May 1945. According to the West German Schieder commission, the civilian population of East Prussia at the beginning of 1944 was 2,653,000 In Schieder East Prussia included the pre war population of 134,000 in Memel and 310,000 from pre war East Prussia administered with Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia people. This accounting, which was based on ration cards, included air raid evacuees from western Germany and foreign workers. Before the end of the war an estimated 2 million people were evacuated, including 500,000 in the Autumn of 1944 and 1,500,000 after January 1945. An estimated 600,000 remained behind in Soviet-controlled East Prussia in April-May 1945.Schieder presented a different set of figures for the territory of East Prussia and Memel that excluded 310,000 persons in the western regions that were included with the population of the province Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. Total population beginning of 1944 2,350,000. Evacuated-In the fall of 1944, 500,000; after January 1945 1,350,000. The balance of 500,000 were captured by the Soviet forces. According to a 1974 West German government study, an estimated 1% of the civilian population was killed during the Soviet offensive. The West German search service reported that 31,940 civilians from East Prussia, which also included Memel, were confirmed as killed during the evacuation.Gesamterhebung zur Klärung des Schicksals der deutschen Bevölkerung in den Vertreibungsgebieten. München : Zentralstelle des Kirchl. Suchdienstes. See Separate table \\"Heimatortskartei für Ostpreussen\\" Propaganda =German= The Red Army initiated an offensive into East Prussia in October 1944, but it was temporarily driven back two weeks later. After that, the German Ministry of Propaganda reported that war crimes had taken place in East Prussian villages, in particular in Nemmersdorf, where inhabitants had been raped and killed by the advancing Soviets.. Since the Nazi war effort had largely stripped the civil population of able-bodied men for service in the military, the victims of the atrocity were primarily old men, women, and children. Upon the Soviet withdrawal from the area, German authorities sent in film crews to document what had happened, and invited foreign observers as further witnesses. A documentary film from the footage obtained during this effort was put together and shown in cinemas in East Prussia, with the intention of fanaticising civilian and military resolve in resisting the Soviets.. A Nazi information campaign about the atrocities at Nemmersdorf, as well as other crimes committed in East Prussia, convinced the remaining civilians that they should not get caught by the advancing enemy.. =Soviet= Since many Soviet soldiers had lost family and friends during the German invasion and partial occupation of the USSR (about 17 million Soviet civilians plus 10 million Soviet soldiers died in World War II, more than in any other country), many felt a desire for vengeance. Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved Ostarbeiter (\\"Eastern workers\\") were freed, and knowledge of the suffering and deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.. Lev Kopelev, who took part in the invasion of East Prussia, sharply criticized atrocities against the German civilian population. For this he was arrested in 1945 and sentenced to a ten- year term in the Gulag for \\"bourgeois humanism\\" and for \\"pity for the enemy\\".. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn also served in East Prussia in 1945 and was arrested for criticizing Joseph Stalin and Soviet crimes in private correspondence with a friend. Solzhenitsyn was sentenced to an eight-year term in a labor camp.. Of the atrocities, Solzhenitsyn wrote: \\"You know very well that we've come to Germany to take our revenge\\" for German atrocities committed in the Soviet Union. Evacuation East Prussian refugees Refugees The evacuation plans for parts of East Prussia were ready in the second half of 1944. They consisted of both general plans and specific instructions for many towns. The plans encompassed not only civilians, but also industry and livestock.Nitschke, p. 43 Initially, Erich Koch, the Gauleiter of East Prussia, forbade evacuation of civilians (until 20 January 1945), and ordered that civilians trying to flee the region without permission should be instantly shot. Any kind of preparations made by civilians were treated as defeatism and \\"Wehrkraftzersetzung\\" (undermining of military morale). Koch and many other Nazi functionaries were among the first to flee during the Soviet advance. Between 12 January and mid-February 1945, almost 8.5 million Germans fled the Eastern provinces of the Reich..Overy notes the total pre-war German population of East Prussia as about 2.9 million , so the rest of those making up Beevor's 8.5 million must be from other places, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia (with a combined pre-war ethnic German population of just over 8 million). Most of the refugees were women and children heading to western parts of Germany, carrying goods on improvised means of transport, such as wooden wagons and carts, as all the motorized vehicles and fuel had been confiscated by the Wehrmacht at the beginning of the war. After the Red Army reached the coast of the Vistula Lagoon near Elbing on 23 January 1945, cutting off the overland route between East Prussia and the western territories, the only way to leave was to cross the frozen Vistula Lagoon to reach the harbours of Danzig or Gotenhafen to be evacuated by ships taking part in Operation Hannibal. Mingled with retreating Wehrmacht units, and without any camouflage or shelter, the refugees were attacked by Soviet bombers and fighter aircraft. Many wagons broke through the bomb-riddled ice covering the brackish water. Furthermore, horses and caretakers from the Trakehner stud farms were evacuated with the wagon trains.Patricia Clough The Flight Across The Ice: The Escape of the East Prussian Horses (2009), Daphne Machin Goodall The Flight of the East Prussian Horses (1973) The evacuation was severely hampered by Wehrmacht units, which clogged roads and bridges. Volkssturm in East Prussia The remaining men aged 16 – 60 were immediately incorporated into the Volkssturm. However, some Volkssturm members, without basic military knowledge and training, escaped into the woods, hoping to simply survive.. Refugee trains leaving East Prussia were also extremely crowded, and due to the very low temperatures, children often froze to death during the journey. The last refugee train left Königsberg on 22 January 1945. Berlin military writer Antony Beevor wrote, in Berlin: The Downfall (2002), that:. =Operation Hannibal= Refugees on a ship near Pillau Operation Hannibal was a military operation that started on 21 January 1945, on the orders of Admiral Karl Dönitz, withdrawing German troops and civilians from Courland, East Prussia, and the Polish Corridor. The flood of refugees turned the operation into one of the largest emergency evacuations by sea in history — over a period of 15 weeks, somewhere between 494 and 1,080 merchant vessels of all types and numerous naval craft, including Germany's largest remaining naval units, transported about 800,000 – 900,000 refugees and 350,000 soldiers across the Baltic Sea to Germany and occupied Denmark.figure of 494 merchant vessels ; figure of 790 vessels of all types ; figure of 1,080 merchant vessels . This evacuation was one of the Kriegsmarine's most significant activities during the war. The greatest recorded loss of life from a ship sinking occurred during this operation, when the transport ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by three torpedoes from the Soviet submarine S-13 in the Baltic Sea on the night of 30 January 1945. She sank in under 45 minutes; figures for the number of deaths vary from 5,348,Irwin J. Kappes states 5,348. He does not cite his sources but recommends: A. V. Sellwood, The Damned Don't Drown: The Sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff (a fiction title about the tragedy); and Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, A Terrible Revenge: The Ethnic Cleansing of the East European Germans 1944–1950.Jason Pipes, citing Heinz Schon (no page number) claims the loss of life was 9,343 to 7,000. or 9,400.\\"Wilhelm Gustloff: World's Deadliest Sea Disasters\\". Unsolved History, The Discovery Channel. Season 1, Episode 14. (Original air date: 26 March 2003) The 949 survivors were rescued by Kriegsmarine vessels led by the cruiser Admiral Hipper, although it is claimed that \\"the big warship could not risk heaving to, with a submarine close by\\". Also, on 10 February, the SS General von Steuben left Pillau with 2,680 refugees on board; it was hit by torpedoes just after departure, killing almost all aboard.. Königsberg Soviet assault on Königsberg from 6 to 9 April 1945 On 24 January 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front led by General Chernyakhovsky, surrounded the capital city of East Prussia, Königsberg. The 3rd Panzer Army and around 200,000 civilians were trapped inside the city.. In response to this, General Georg- Hans Reinhardt, commander of the Army Group Center, warned Hitler of the imminent Soviet threat, but the Führer refused to act. Due to the rapid approach of the 2nd Belorussian Front led by General Rokossovsky, Nazi authorities in Königsberg decided to send trains full of refugees to Allenstein, without knowing that the town had already been captured by the Soviet 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps. During the Soviet assault, the Frische Nehrung spit became the last means of escape to the west. However, civilians who tried to escape along the spit were often intercepted and killed by Soviet tanks and patrols.. Two thousand civilians left Königsberg every day and tried to reach the already crowded town of Pillau. The final Soviet assault on Königsberg started on 2 April with a heavy bombardment of the city. The land route to Pillau was once again severed and those civilians who were still in the city died by the thousands. Eventually, the Nazi garrison surrendered on 9 April, and as Beevor wrote, \\"the rape of women and girls went unchecked in the ruined city\\". Crimes The widely publicized killings and rapes in places like Nemmersdorf by the Soviets led to a severe degree of fear in the entire German population of East Prussia. Those that could not escape the advancing Soviets were left to their fate. Wealthy civilians of East Prussia were often shot by Soviet soldiers, their goods stolen, and their houses set on fire. Zakhar Agranenko, a playwright serving as an officer of marine infantry in East Prussia, wrote: > \\"Red Army soldiers don't believe in 'individual liaisons' with German women. > Nine, ten, twelve men at a time – they rape them on a collective basis.\\" Even Russian women liberated from forced labor camps were raped by Soviet soldiers. The rear-guard units of the advancing Soviet armies were responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed by Red Army personnel. Soviet Officers like Lev Kopelev, who tried to prevent crimes, were accused of pity for the enemy and became Gulag prisoners. These acts of violence were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected the will of the political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia was the result of the Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it. Aftermath Germany's territorial losses after World War II highlighted in green and pink The Red Army eliminated all pockets of resistance and took control of East Prussia in May 1945. The exact number of civilian dead has never been determined, but is estimated to be at least 300,000. However, most of the German inhabitants, which at that point consisted mainly of children, women, and old men, did escape the Red Army as part of the largest exodus of people in human history.. Antony Beevor said: > \\"A population which had stood at 2.2 million in 1940 was reduced to 193,000 > at the end of May 1945.\\" The Schieder commission in 1953 estimated casualties in the 1945 campaign at 30,000 civilian dead in East Prussia, and overall civilian losses in the entire Oder–Neisse region at 75–100,000. The West German Statistisches Bundesamt figures from 1958 estimated total civilian losses in East Prussia of 299,200 including 274,200 in the expulsions after May 1945 and 25,000 during the war. According to the Statistisches Bundesamt, in total, out of a pre-war population of 2,490,000, about 500,000 died during the war, including 210,000 military dead and 311,000 civilians dying during the wartime flight, postwar expulsion of Germans and forced labor in the Soviet Union; 1,200,000 managed to escape to the western parts of Germany, while about 800,000 pre-war inhabitants remained in East Prussia in summer 1945. The figure of 311,000 civilian deaths is included in the overall estimate of 2.2 million expulsion deaths that is often cited in historical literature. The West German search service issued its final report in 1965 detailing the losses of the German civilian population due to the flight and expulsions. The West German government authorized its release in 1986, and a summary of the findings was published in 1987 by the German scholar :de:Gert von Pistohlkors.Pistohlkors, Gert : Informationen zur Klärung der Schicksale von Flüchtlingen aus den.

Lax, 1987 According to the West German search service, the civilian population of East Prussia (including Memel) before the flight and expulsions was 2,328,947. They put civilian dead and missing at 514,176 persons. The number of confirmed dead was 123,360 (9,434 violent deaths, 736 suicides, 9,864 deportation deaths, 7,841 in internment camps, 31,940 deaths during the wartime flight, 22,308 during the expulsions and 41,237 from unknown causes). There were an additional 390,816 cases of persons reported missing whose fate could not be clarified. Some historians in Germany maintain that the search service figures of confirmed dead provide a realistic view of the total losses due to the flight and expulsions; they believe that the cases of persons reported missing whose fate could not be clarified are unreliable.Herausforderung Bevölkerung : zu Entwicklungen des modernen Denkens über die Bevölkerung vor, im und nach dem Dritten Reich Ingo Haar, Bevölkerungsbilanzen“ und „Vertreibungsverluste.

Paderborn 2010, The German historian Rüdiger Overmans maintains that the statistical foundations of the West German government search service report to be unreliable; he believes that new research on the number of expulsion deaths is needed.Dr. Rűdiger Overmans- Personelle Verluste der deutschen Bevölkerung durch Flucht und Vertreibung. (A parallel Polish summary translation was also included, this paper was a presentation at an academic conference in Warsaw Poland in 1994), Dzieje Najnowsze Rocznik XXI-1994Rüdiger Overmans, Deutschlandfunk interview of 6 December 2006 However, the German government and the German Red Cross still maintain that the higher figures which include the persons reported missing whose fate could not be clarified are correct.Christoph Bergner, Secretary of State in Germany's Bureau for Inner Affairs, outlines the stance of the respective governmental institutions in Deutschlandfunk on 29 November 2006, Willi Kammerer; Anja Kammerer- Narben bleiben die Arbeit der Suchdienste – 60 Jahre nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg Berlin Dienststelle 2005, p. 12(Published by the Search Service of the German Red Cross.) The German Federal Archives estimated that about 1% (100–120,000 of the estimated 11–12 million total German civilian population) in the Oder–Neisse region lost their lives due to military activity in the 1944–45 campaign as well as deliberate killings by Soviet forces. According to other sources, in summer 1945 about 800,000 Germans were still living in East Prussia. The Red Army's brutality towards civilians during the East Prussian campaign, coupled with years of Nazi propaganda regarding the Soviet Union, led many German soldiers on the Eastern Front to believe that \\"there could be no purpose in surviving Soviet victory\\". This belief motivated many German soldiers to continue fighting even though they believed that the war was lost, and this contributed to higher Soviet casualties. Most Germans who were not evacuated during the war were expelled from East Prussia and the other former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line in the years immediately after the end of World War II, as agreed to by the Allies at the Potsdam conference, because, in the words of Winston Churchill: After World War II, as also agreed at the Potsdam Conference (which met from 17 July until 2 August 1945), all of the area east of the Oder-Neisse line, whether recognized by the international community as part of Germany before 1933 or occupied by Germany during World War II, was placed under the jurisdiction of other countries.

It lies at the edge of the West Woods in the Kennet Valley, west of Marlborough, east of Avebury and south of Swindon. It is south of the A4 road which was historically the main route from London to the west of England. Lockeridge Dene is a hamlet immediately southwest of the village. Lockeridge and its surroundings have provided evidence of Stone and Bronze Age activity in the area. Field enclosures close to the village indicate Roman occupation, whilst the village itself appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. Lockeridge today forms an agricultural and commuter community with no local industry. The community is served by a village pub, the Who'd a Thought It, but has no other services.  History  The area has extensive evidence of Neolithic settlement and a Bronze Age burial site was discovered behind the school in the 19th century. Field enclosures on White Hill (a ridge above the village) provide evidence of Roman occupation probably linked to the nearby fortress town of Cunetio. One possible derivation of the name is from the Old English composite word loc(a)-hrycg meaning \\"a ridge marked by enclosure(s)\\". At the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, Lockeridge was owned by Durand of Gloucester and is described as follows: Durand himself holds LOCKERIDGE. Almær held it TRE, and it paid geld for 2 hides. There is land for 1 plough. Of this 1 hide is in demesne. There is 1 villan and 2 bordars with 1 slave, and of meadow, and of pasture and of woodland. It was worth 40s ; now 30s. These two late Anglo-Saxon estates are held to be linked to the cluster of houses at Lockeridge Dene at the southern end of the village, and the eighteenth-century Lockeridge House at the northern end. Lockeridge House is adjacent to Piper's Lane, remnant of a Roman road. Building took place between the two Saxon settlements in the 12th century on the order of the Knights Templar who acquired one of the estates between 1141 and 1143. In 1155–1156 it acquired land in Rockley to build a Preceptory. Lockeridge is therefore something rare in Britain, namely a planned Templar village. The collapse of the nearby settlement of Shaw as a result of the Plague may have triggered growth as Lockeridge was situated at an intersection of a major east-west route (now the A4) and a crossing of the Pewsey Downs. The Templar link explains the absence (rare in Wiltshire villages) of a church. Lockeridge House was built c. 1740 and is Grade II* listed. The settlement expanded from a hamlet to a village in the 1870s when Sir Henry Meux sited his estate office (Gypsy Furlong) and the estate yard (Yardacre) in the village. Houses, a school and a pub were built at the same time. In consequence of this history there are three main architectural styles in the village. * Sarsen stone, generally painted or left rough-hewn, and thatched with wheat or wheat-reed mix. * Victorian estate architecture built of dressed stones or Wiltshire redbrick with sarsen banding. Many of these are the work of C.E. Ponting, architect to the Meux estate in the 1870s. * 20th-century solid brick council housing and in-fill in a variety of styles, in the main street and on Back Lane and Rhyls Lane.  Governance  Lockeridge forms part of the civil parish of West Overton, which elects a joint parish council with the adjacent parish of Fyfield; the council is named Fyfield and West Overton. It falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.  Landmarks  Lockeridge Dene Lockeridge Dene at the south end of the village is a National Trust site and is a conservation area. Sarsen stones are scattered over the area and this is one of the sites from which the stones at Avebury were mined. The village is adjacent to the nearby West Woods. In the spring these are carpeted with bluebells and provide a tourist attraction with the woods being opened to vehicles on two weekends. Walks from the village lead through the West Woods onto the Pewsey Downs and the Wansdyke, an early medieval earthwork that ran from near Andover to the Bristol Channel and became the border between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex.  Transport  The village is served by an \\"on demand\\" bus service.  Education  Kennet Valley Lower SchoolThe Kennet Valley Church of England Primary School was consolidated from two locations in July 2011. A single-site school for 4- to 11-year-olds was created by extending the 1872 school building designed by Charles Ponting. For secondary education most children go on to St John's, Marlborough.  Sports  The Kennet Valley Cricket Club plays in the village comprising residents of Lockeridge along with those of West Overton, East Kennett and Fyfield. It also hosts an annual New Years Day football and Rugby match between the west and east of the Kennet Valley for the Baliszewski Cup (named after the founder of the tradition, Edward Baliszewski, who died in 2008). Played by all ages, to ad hoc rules including two simultaneous football matches played with two balls on the same pitch; men may only play with one ball, women and children with either.

They are extant, and known from the fossil record, from at least the Devonian period and perhaps before. They were originally classified in a single order Conchostraca, which later proved to be paraphyletic, being separated into three different orders: Cyclestherida, Laevicaudata, and Spinicaudata.  Characteristics  Both valves of the shell are held together by a strong closing muscle. The animals react to danger by contracting the muscle, so that the valves close tightly and the crustacean, as if dead, lies motionlessly at the bottom of the pool. In most species the head is dorsoventrally compressed. The sessile compound eyes are close together and located on the forehead; in the genus Cyclestheria they are truly fused. In front of them is a simple naupliar eye. The first pair of antennae is reduced and unsegmented. The second pair of antennae, however, is long and biramous. Both branches are covered with numerous bristles. The crustaceans swim primarily by swooping the antennae. In the common genus Lynceus, which can open its spherical valves wide, the thoracic legs move in an oar-like manner along with the antennae. The number of segments constituting the thorax varies from 10 to 32, and the number of legs varies accordingly. They are similar in structure to the legs of tadpole shrimp, and similarly, their size decreases from front to back. In females, the outer lobes of several middle legs are modified into long, upward-bending threadlike outgrowths, used to hold the eggs on the dorsal side of the body under the shell. However, the main functions of the thoracic legs are respiration and carrying food forward to the mouth. The gills are basically the outer lobes of all thoracic legs that are closest to the base of the leg. The legs are in constant movement, and the water between the valves of the carapace is quickly renewed. The body ends in a large chitinised telson, which is either laterally compressed and bears a pair of large hooks, or dorsoventrally compressed, with short hooks.  Reproduction and development  = Reproduction = Clam shrimp have different reproductive strategies. For example, within the family Limnadiidae are found dioecious (male-female), hermaphroditic (only hermaphrodites), and androdioecious (male- hermaphrodite) species. = Life cycle = The eggs are surrounded by a tough shell and can withstand drying out, freezing and other hostile conditions. In some species these eggs can hatch after as long as 7 years. When the egg arrives in a suitable pool, a larva hatches out at the nauplius stage. Clam shrimp nauplii are distinguished by very small front antennae. At the second stage (metanauplius), the larva develops the small shell. They develop very quickly. For instance, Cyzicus reaches sexual maturity in 19 days after hatching.  Taxonomy  California clam shrimp, Cyzicus californicus Extant clam shrimp belong to three orders, divided into five families; some notable genera and prehistoric taxa are also listed: Spinicaudata Linder, 1945 * Cyzicidae Stebbing, 1910 ** Caenestheria ** Caenestheriella ** Cyzicus ** Eocyzicus * Eosestheriidae Zhang & Chen, 1976 (fossil) ** Bairdestheria ** Menucoestheria Gallego & Covacevich, 1998 * Euestheridae Defretin, 1965 (fossil) ** Laxitextella Kozur, 1982 * Leptestheriidae Daday, 1923 ** Eoleptestheria ** Leptestheria ** Leptestheriella ** Maghrebestheria ** Sewellestheria * Limnadiidae Baird, 1849 (including Imnadiidae) ** Eulimnadia ** Imnadia ** Limnadia ** Limnadiopsis ** Limnadiopsidum ** Metalimnadia * Palaeolimnadiidae Tasch, 1956 (fossil) ** Krasiestheria Olempska, 2004 (tentatively placed here) Cyclestherida Sars, 1899 * Cyclestheriidae Sars, 1899 ** Cyclestheria ** Paracyclestheria Laevicaudata Linder, 1945 * Lynceidae Baird, 1845 ** Lynceiopsis ** Lynceus ** Paralimnetis  Geological history  Modern clam shrimp have little significance to humans. However, extinct species of these crustaceans are often studied by geologists. In freshwater deposits, generally poor in fossils, the well-preserved clam shrimp shells are found quite often. They help identify the age of the corresponding strata. During the past geological periods clam shrimp were apparently more numerous and diverse than they are now. 300 extinct species are known, and half as many living species. The oldest clam shrimp, such as Asmussia murchisoniana, were found in Devonian deposits. Many extinct species, especially Triassic ones, lived in the sea, where no clam shrimp remain today.

These can be titles prefixing a person's name, e.g.: Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms, Mx, Sir, Dr, Lady or Lord, or titles or positions that can appear as a form of address without the person's name, as in Mr President, General, Captain, Father, Doctor or Earl. Many forms of honorifics are for members of the nobility, clergy, military/naval forces, or royalty, mostly in countries that are monarchies. These include \\"Your Majesty\\", \\"Your Royal Highness\\" or simply \\"Your Highness\\", which are used to address certain members of royalty and \\"My lord/lady\\" or \\"Your Lordship/Ladyship\\" to address a peer other than a Duke, who is referred to as \\"Your Grace\\".

Although most all male adults of the LDS church are Elders, the title is reserved for the prior mentioned groups. Elder is also used as a title for members of a ruling church body in a Presbyterian polity. They may be either appointed by a more powerful body like a session or elected by the congregation, but both are ordained for the purpose of governing a church. =Judaism= * Rabbi: In Judaism, a rabbi is an ordained religious officiant or a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word ' , meaning \\"My Master\\" (irregular plural רבנים ' ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \\"master\\" רב ' literally means \\"great one\\". * The Reverend: Was often used for rabbis, cantors, mohalim, and shochetim in English speaking countries.

Sometimes an honorific title if a community rabbi has an ancestor who served as a chief rabbi of a town, or for a son of a grand rabbi who is heir apparent to the position of grand rabbi and serves a rabbinical role in a Hasidic community. Generally, in such cases, this is known in Hebrew as אב בית דין, meaning \\"leader of the rabbinical court\\" (literally \\"father of the house of law\\"), and abbreviated אב\\"ד. May also be titled as גאון אב בית דין or ראש אב בית דין, which would be abbreviated as גאב\\"ד or ראב\\"ד. These abbreviations may be rendered in English spelling as Ab\\"d, Gaava\\"d, or Raava\\"d, and will often be called \\"Rav\\". Generally the abbreviated title will be followed either by the name of the city or town (including ancestral towns), or the name of the congregation, or when called \\"Rav\\" the town or congregation will come before the title. For example, the chief rabbi of the Vien community is known either as \\"Ab\\"d Vien\\" or the \\"Vienner Rav\\". In some communities, particularly those from Hungarian and Galician backgrounds, the title is used interchangeably with the title of Grand Rabbi or Admo\\"r. * Grand Rabbi: The charismatic leader of a Hasidic court or community. Generally known in Hebrew as אדונינו מורינו ורבינו, literally \\"our lord, our teacher, our rabbi\\", and abbreviated as אדמו\\"ר and rendered in English spelling as Admo\\"r or Rebbe. Generally the abbreviated title will be followed either by the name of the city or town (including ancestral towns), or the name of the congregation, or when called \\"Rebbe\\" the town or congregation will come before the title. For example, the grand rabbis of the Boston Hasidic communities would be known as either \\"Admo\\"r miBoston\\" or \\"Bostoner Rebbe\\". * Rebbetzin: A rabbi's wife, although in some sense a religious leader for the women in her community in some communities. =Islam= * Imām: for Islamic clergymen, especially the ones who lead prayers and deliver sermons. * Shaykh: umbrella term used for those qualified in various fields of knowledge of Islam, (Informally, Bearing no relation to the religion, and in addition to its religious title, it's occasionally used as an honorary term to refer to a wealthy person or a person with authority or from the dynasty lineage synonymous with the title \\"Prince\\"). *Muftī: males qualified in Islamic jurisprudence with ability to pass legal verdicts. * Hāfiz or Hāfizah: respectively males and females who have memorised the entire Qur'an (literally 'protector'). * Qārī: males who are qualified in the multiple ways of reading the Qur'an (literally 'reciter'). *Mawlānā: used in some cultures for those who have completed Dars un-Nizām to qualify as a scholar (literally 'our leader'). * Hājī (): used by Muslims who have completed the hajj pilgrimage. * Sayyid and Sayyidah: respectively males and females accepted as descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his grandsons, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, sons of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and his son-in-law Ali (Ali ibn Abi Talib). * Sharif: used for descendants of Hasan. =Buddhism= * His Holiness: Used for leaders such as the Dalai Lama and the Karmapa. * Venerable (abbreviation Ven): Ordained Buddhist monks and nuns, as well as novices are referred to as Venerable. * Eminent (abbreviation Emi): Buddhist gurus who perfect their mastery of religious practices and philosophy by physical enhancement or ideals which make them renowned.

It was the third of four Anglo–Mysore Wars. Background Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Kingdom of Mysore, and his father Hyder Ali before him, had previously fought twice with the forces of the British East India Company. The First Anglo-Mysore War, fought in the 1760s, had ended inconclusively, with treaty provisions including promises of mutual assistance in future conflicts. British failure to support Mysore in conflicts with the Maratha Empire and other actions supportive of Mysore's enemies led Hyder to develop a dislike for the British. Tipu has been a controversial figure and criticized for his repression of Hindus and Christians. Various independent sources describe the massacres of Christians and Hindus,Kerala District Gazetteers: Cannanore By A. Sreedhara Menon p.134-137 imprisonment, forced conversion, and circumcision of Hindus (Kodavas of Coorg and Nairs of Malabar) and Christians (Catholics of Mangalore) and the destruction of churchesSarasvati's Children, Joe Lobo and templesPanikkassery, Velayudhan. MM Publications (2007), Kottayam India which are cited as evidence for his religious intolerance. The personal letters written by Tipu Sultan himself claim that he was fighting a religious war i.e. Jihad against the Hindus and Christians; a critical socio religious component which was missing in the opposition parties of Marathas and British armies. But it might be just a political move and the allegations might be based on hearsay evidences. During the war Sringeri Monastry was damaged. Tipu had ordered the repair of the temple.The Sringeri monastery had been patronised by rulers – both Hindu and Muslim – ever since it was founded. Tipu continued this tradition and maintained a close relationship with the abbey, sending it valuable gifts and awarding it tax-free land. In fact, in his personal correspondence, Tipu would address the monastery’s swamy, head reverentially as “jagadguru” or “ruler of the world”. This prestige of the temple meant the temple was also wealthy, which was probably why the Marathas sacked it during the battle, after they were retreating – the first time it was to see such a calamity in its millennia-long history. The Pindari troops of Marathas, who were hired mercenaries, stripped the monastery of its considerable wealth, killed many Brahmins and desecrated the idol of the temple’s presiding deity, the goddess Sharada. After the attack, the Swamy, who fled the sack, wrote urgently to Tipu asking for his help in reconsecrating the idol of Sharada. Anguished and enraged Tipu replied, writing in Sanskrit, “People do evil smiling but will suffer the penalty in torments of agony.” The Sultan also made monetary arrangements for the consecration of the Goddess and also sent along his token gifts for the idol. According to some nationalist historians, most probably it were his arch-enemy, the British who had spread the propaganda about Tipu being an intolerant ruler. After the British took the French-controlled port of Mahé in 1779, Hyder, who had been receiving military supplies through that port and had placed it under his protection, opened the Second Anglo–Mysore War. This war ended with the last British-Indian treaty with an Indian ruler on equal footing, the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore, which restored the status quo ante bellum under terms company officials such as Warren Hastings found extremely unfavourable for the British East India Company. Tipu, who gained control of Mysore after his father's death in December 1782, maintained an implacable hatred of the British, and declared not long after signing the 1784 treaty that he intended to continue battle with them given the opportunity. He refused to free British prisoners taken during the war, one of the conditions of the treaty. Tipu Sultan further strengthened his alliances with Ali Raja Bibi Junumabe II the Muslim ruler and the Muslim Mappila community of a region under the Zamorin of Calicut empire,thus expanding the Sultanate of Mysore's sphere of influence. British General Charles, 2nd Earl Cornwallis became the Governor-General of India and Commander-in-Chief for the East India Company in 1786. While he formally abrogated agreements with the Marathas and Hyderabad that violated terms of the 1784 treaty,Fortescue, p. 546 he sought informally to gain their support and that of the Nizam of Hyderabad, or at least their neutrality, in the event of conflict with Mysore. Events leading to war A portrait of Tipu Sultan, made during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. In 1788 the company gained control of the Circar of Guntur, the southernmost of the Northern Circars, which the company had acquired under earlier agreements with the Nizam. In exchange, the company provided the Nizam with two battalions of company troops.Wickwire, p. 127 Both of these acts placed British troops closer to Mysore, but also guaranteed the Nizam would support the British in the event of conflict.Wickwire, p. 128 The kingdom of Travancore had been a target of Tipu for acquisition or conquest since the end of the previous war. Indirect attempts to take over the kingdom had failed in 1788, and Archibald Campbell, the Madras president at the time, had warned Tipu that an attack on Travancore would be treated as a declaration of war on the company.Fortescue, p. 549 The rajah of Travancore also angered Tipu by extending fortifications along the border with Cochin into territory claimed by Mysore as belonging to its vassal state, and by purchasing from the Dutch East India Company two forts in the Kingdom of Cochin, a state paying tribute to Tipu Sultan. In 1789 Tipu Sultan sent forces onto the Malabar Coast to put down a rebellion. Many people fled to Travancore, a state independent of Mysore and to Cochin, a state paying tribute to Tipu, in the wake of his advance.Fortescue, p. 548 To follow them, Tipu began, in the fall of 1789 to build up troops at Coimbatore in preparation for an assault on the Nedumkotta, a fortified line of defence built by Dharma Raja of Travancore to protect his domain. Cornwallis, observing this build-up, reiterated to Campbell's successor, John Holland, that an attack on Travancore should be considered a declaration of war, and met with a strong British response. Tipu, aware that Holland was not the experienced military officer that Campbell was, and that he did not have the close relationship that Campbell and Cornwallis had (both had served in North America in the American War of Independence), probably decided that this was an opportune time to attack. Early campaigns On 29 December 1789, Tipu marched 14,000 troops from Coimbatore and attacked the Nedumkotta. The first phase was an embarrassing defeat for Tipu, when the defenders inflicted severe losses on the Tipu's forces and drove them back. While the Mysorean forces and their allies regrouped, Governor Holland, much to Cornwallis' dismay, engaged in negotiations with Tipu rather than mobilising the military. Cornwallis was on the brink of going to Madras to take command when he received word that Holland's replacement, General William Medows was about to arrive. Medows forcibly removed Holland, and set about planning operations against Tipu while building up troops at Trichinopoly.Fortescue, p. 550 =Medows' campaign, 1790= It was May before Medows was prepared to march. In the meantime, Tipu had renewed his attack on Travancore, and successfully breached the Nedumkotta line in late April 1790, despite the heavy losses inflicted by the Tranvancorean army. British forces in Travancore were too few to withstand the assault, and withdrew to the Ayacotta fortress and the Travancorean army made a strategic retreat to the further bank of the Periyar river and prepared to contest the crossing of the river. The monsoon rains prevented the Mysorean army from fording the river and as Tipu received the news that the British campaign from Madras began to take shape as a significant threat, he retreated from Travancore. The plan of attack developed by Medows called for a two- pronged attack, with the main thrust against the Coimbatore district and a diversionary thrust into Mysore from the northeast.Fortescue, pp. 550–551 Cornwallis was unhappy with this plan, due in part to the lateness of the season (combat being much more difficult during the monsoon season), and the lengthy supply lines from Madras that the plan entailed. However, he was willing to give Medows the opportunity for independent command. Medows moved out of Trichinopoly in late May. Hampered by weather and equipment problems, his progress was slow. He met little resistance, as Tipu had withdrawn his main forces to the Mysore highlands. On 21 July Medows entered Coimbatore unopposed, after having taken some of the smaller fortifications in the district by either abandonment or the immediate surrender of the garrison.Fortescue, p. 552 His only opposition consisted of 4,000 cavalry under Sayed Sahib that Tipu had detached to observe and harass his operations; most of these were eventually driven across the Bhavani River by Medows' cavalry. Further strong points in the district fell, with Palghat and Dindigul requiring significant action to capture. Although the campaign was successful in gaining complete control of the Coimbatore district, Medows had to divide his forces to hold it, with the largest detachments at Coimbatore, Palghat, and Sathyamangalam. The attack from Bengal, and a third from Bombay, were late in getting started when Tipu made his counterattack.Fortescue, p. 554 Unsigned watercolor by unknown Indian artist. =Tipu's counterattack= On 2 September, Tipu left Srirangapatnam at the head of a 40,000-man army. Descending the mountain passes beginning on 9 September, he began to move toward Sathyamangalam. While the 2,800-man garrison there withstood an initial assault from Tipu's force on 13 September, Captain John Floyd, the garrison commander, opted to withdraw. Under cover of night, they crossed the Bhavani and headed for Coimbatore. Tipu, slowed by heavy rains, sent 15,000 cavalry in pursuit. These eventually caught up and captured much of Floyd's baggage train, and continued to pursue the weary garrison. That evening, the full force of Tipu's army fell upon them as they camped at Cheyoor. A desperate stand by the infantry repulsed repeated assaults, and only the arrival of reinforcements sent by Medows rescued them. Tipu then embarked on a campaign of harassing the British supply and communications, while screening the movements of his main force. In early November he successfully misled Medows, moving much of his army north to attack the smaller Bengal force. This force, about 9,000 men led by Colonel Maxwell, had reached Kaveripattinam and strongly fortified his position.Fortescue, p. 558 Unable to penetrate the defences, Tipu withdrew to the south on 14 November after learning that Medows was on his trail again. Medows and Maxwell joined forces on 17 November, and pursued Tipu, who had decided to make a move toward Trichinopoly. Unable to do more than pillage the town before Medows arrived, Tipu then moved on to rampage through the Carnatic, destroying towns and seizing supplies as he went. He ended up at the French outpost at Pondicherry, where he attempted to interest the French in supporting his efforts against the British. As France was then in the early stages of its Revolution, these efforts were entirely unsuccessful. Medows at this point moved toward Madras, where he turned over command of his army to Lord Cornwallis. =Allied advances= British forces advance towards Bangalore. Tipu sultan had turned the wars against the British, Kerala and the Marathas into a religious War, as evidenced by his personal letters. He massacred numerous Hindus and Christians, not sparing even the women and children and destroyed numerous churches, Hindu temples and even synagogues. Tipu has been a controversial figure and criticized for his repression of Hindus and Christians. Various sources describe the massacres, imprisonment, forced conversion, and circumcision of Hindus (Kodavas of Coorg and Nairs of Malabar) and Christians (Catholics of Mangalore) and the destruction of churchesSarasvati's Children, Joe Lobo and templesPanikkassery, Velayudhan. MM Publications (2007), Kottayam India which are cited as evidence for his religious intolerance. He also reneged on his promises of humanely treating and releasing the Prisoners of Wars. For eg. in one case noted by a chronicler, he killed a local king who had submitted to him and got his body dragged through the city. Many Christian missionaries also documented his torture of local Christians and destroying their churches and temples. During the summer of 1790, a Maratha army of some 30,000 under the command of Purseram Bhow, accompanied by a detachment of British troops from Bombay, began marching toward Mysore. The first several Mysorean outposts surrendered in the face of the large army, and it made steady if slow progress until it reached Darwar in September. The fort was weakly and indifferently besieged for 29 weeks, with the garrison finally surrendering on 3 April 1791.Mills, p. 275 The army then continued to advance, reaching the Tungabhadra River in early May. A second army, consisting of 25,000 cavalry and 5,000 infantry under the command of Hurry Punt assisted by a detachment of British soldiers from the Madras army, left Poona in January 1791, eventually reaching Kurnool without significant opposition.Duff, p. 202 Hurry Punt went to confer with the Nizam, who had not crossed into Mysore in fear that Tipu's large army would overwhelm his before it could be joined to that of one of the other allies. On receiving word that Cornwallis had captured Bangalore and was moving toward the Mysorean capital, Srirangapatnam, Hurry Punt moved out from Kurnool, and made junction with Cornwallis on 28 May. The Nizam's army, led by Mahabat Jung, advanced to Koppal, which they besieged in October 1790. Poor-quality cannons impeded the conduct of the siege, which was not successfully concluded until April 1791. Earl Cornwallis, portrait by John Singleton Copley =British take the Malabar coast= British forces succeeded in taking control of the Malabar coast late in 1790. One force under Colonel Hartley gained a decisive victory at Calicut in December, while a second under Robert Abercromby routed the Sultan at Cannanore a few days later.Fortescue, p. 561 =Nawab of Savanur= Territory associated with the Nawab of Savanur were lost to the Maratha Confederacy. Such events caused mistrust between the English and the agenda of the Peshwa. First advance on Seringapatam Cornwallis' first goal was to take the strong point of Bangalore, which would provide a base for future operations against Seringapatam. He hoped that this would stimulate the allies to step up their activity. Anticipating that Tipu would engage in a scorched-earth campaign in the highlands of Mysore, he made significant arrangements for provisions. To assist in the hauling of supplies and heavy armaments he also retained a significant number of elephants.Fortescue, p. 563 Cornwallis's army marching towards Malwakul Cornwallis took over the main British army at Vellore on 29 January 1791. A week later he marched west, as if to pass through the Eastern Ghats at that point. This prompted Tipu to abandon Pondicherry and make haste for Bangalore, where he perceived his harem to be at some risk. Although Tipu placed defences on some of the passes, Cornwallis, after a number of feints, turned sharply north, and crossed the mountains at the Muglee Pass on 21 February against no opposition.Fortescue, p. 564 He then continued to advance, against virtually no resistance, until he was very nearly before the gates of Bangalore on 5 March. Tipu had fortified the city and supplied the garrison, but he stayed with his main force on the outskirts of the British positions as Cornwallis began siege operations. After six weeks of siege, in which the British had to repeatedly beat off attacks and skirmishes from Tipu, they successfully stormed the citadel. Political cartoon by James Gillray, making fun of Lord Cornwallis after his 1791 retreat from Seringapatam After securing Bangalore, Cornwallis turned his army north to meet a supply caravan and to effect a junction with the Nizam's army, which took place on 12 April about north of Bangalore. Turning back toward Bangalore, Cornwallis found the Nizam's men to be noticeably unhelpful. He had hoped that the addition of native cavalry to the army would assist in offsetting Tipu's advantage in that quarter, but the Nizam's men, commanded by Teige Wunt, were interested in plunder and in living off the army's supplies instead of foraging and scouting against Tipu.Fortescue, p. 570 The British then embarked on a series of operations to secure most of the area around Bangalore before moving on to Seringapatam. When Cornwallis was seeking a ford at which to cross the Cauvery River, Tipu offered him battle at a ford near the village of Arakere. In the ensuing battle on 15 May, Cornwallis flanked Tipu's position and drove him to retreat behind Seringapatam's walls.Fortescue, p. 575 Since the Marathan forces were apparently not nearby, and it seemed unlikely that Abercromby would arrive with the Malabar forces, and his army was on the verge of starvation, Cornwallis then made the difficult decision on 22 May to destroy his siege train and retreat.Fortescue, p. 576 Only three days later, the Maratha army arrived, Tipu having successfully prevented most of its messengers from reaching Cornwallis before then. Cornwallis' retreat to Bangalore exposed the Coimbatore district to Tipu's forces. On 11 June, 2,000 Mysorean forces laid siege to Coimbatore. Lieutenant Chalmers, the garrison commander, ignored orders from Cornwallis to withdraw if attacked in force, and chose to fight, in spite of having less than 300 men and inferior gunpowder. His defence was spirited, and reinforcements from Palgautcherry prompted him to sortie and successfully take the defenders' supply train in August. Eight thousand more Mysoreans then arrived, but Chalmers held out until 6 November. In violation of the agreed terms of surrender Chalmers and his men were taken prisoner.Fortescue, p. 578 Second advance on Seringapatam Cannon used by Tipu Sultan's forces at the battle of Seringapatam 1799 The flag of the Kingdom of Mysore at the entrance into the fort of Bangalore. Following the allied retreat to Bangalore, the armies of Purseram Bhow and Teige Wunt left the grand army to pursue territorial gains in Mysore's northern territories. Purseram Bhow, desirous of recapturing the Bednore district that Tipu's father Hyder had taken in an earlier war, captured Hooly Honore and Shimoga, although British forces attached to his army did much of the necessary work. Only the threatened arrival of a detachment from Tipu's army prevented him from laying siege to Bednore itself. Bhow did not return to the grand army until after peace negotiations began at Seringapatam. Whereas the earl's younger brother, Commodore William Cornwallis, was engaged in the naval Battle of Tellicherry, Charles spent the remainder of 1791 securing his supply lines to Madras. To this end he laid siege to Nundydroog in November and Savendroog in December, both of which fell after unexpectedly modest efforts. He also ordered a massive supply operation to ensure that adequate supplies and pay for his army and those of the allies would be available. Spies were sent to infiltrate Tipu's camps, and he began to receive more reliable reports of the latter's troop strengths and disposition.Wickwire, p. 161 The relations between Cornwallis and the allies were difficult. The Marathan military leaders, Purseram Bhow and Hurry Punt, had to be bribed to stay with the army, and Cornwallis reported the Hyderabadi forces to be more of a hindrance than a help; one British observer wrote that they were a \\"disorderly rabble\\" and \\"not very creditable to the state of military discipline at Hyderabad.\\"Wickwire, p. 162 On 25 January, Cornwallis moved from Savendroog toward Seringapatam, while Abercromby again advanced from the Malabar coast. While Tipu's men harassed the column, they did not impede its progress. Cornwallis established a chain of outposts to protect the supply line from Bangalore. When the massive army reached the plains before Seringapatam on 5 February, Tipu's began showering the force with rockets. Cornwallis responded with a night-time attack to dislodge Tipu from his lines. After a somewhat confused battle, Tipu's forces were flanked, and he retreated into the city, and Cornwallis began siege operations. On 12 February Abercromby arrived with the Bombay army, and the noose began to tighten around Tipu. By 23 February, Tipu began making overtures for peace talks, and hostilities were suspended the next day when he agreed to preliminary terms.Wickwire, p. 170 Peace General Lord Cornwallis receiving Tipoo Sultan's sons as hostages, by Robert Home, c. 1793 General Lord Cornwallis receiving Tipu Sultan's sons as hostages. Among the preliminary terms that Cornwallis insisted on was that Tipu surrender two of his sons as hostages as a guarantee for his execution of the agreed terms. On 26 February his two young sons were formally delivered to Cornwallis amid great ceremony and gun salutes by both sides. Cornwallis, who was not interested in significantly extending the company's territory, or in turning most of Mysore over to the Mahrattas and Hyderabad, negotiated a division of one half of Mysorean territory, to be divided by the allies, in which the company's acquisition would improve its defences. He later wrote, \\"If we had taken Seringapatam and killed Tippoo, [...] we must either have given that capital to the Marattas (a dangerous boon) or have set up some miserable pageant of our own, to be supported by the Company's troops and treasures, and to be plundered by its servants.\\"Wickwire, p. 171 The territories taken deprived Mysore of much of its coastline; Mysore was also obligated to pay some of the allied war costs. On 18 March 1792 Tipu agreed to the terms and signed the Treaty of Seringapatam, ending hostilities.Wickwire, p. 173 1794 Map showing \\"The Territories ceded by Tipu Sultan to the Different Powers\\" Consequences The war resulted in a sharp curtailment of Mysore's borders to the advantage of the Mahrattas, the Nizam of Hyderabad, Travancore and the Madras Presidency. The districts of Malabar, Salem, Bellary and Anantapur were ceded to the Madras Presidency.David Eggenberger, An Encyclopedia of Battles, 1985 A fourth and final war was fought between the British and Mysore in 1799, in which Seringapatam was taken, and Tipu was killed in its defence. The victors, rather than partitioning the country, forced Tipu's family into exile and restored control of Mysore to the Wodeyars.Yadav, p. 2837 One notable military advance championed by Tipu Sultan was the use of mass attacks with rocket brigades, called kushoons, in the army. The weapons used by the kushoons sufficiently impressed the British during the Third and Fourth Mysore Wars to inspire William Congreve to develop Congreve rockets. Cornwallis was raised to the title of Marquess for his actions in the war,Wickwire, p. 174 while the native Indian soldiers under his command were awarded the Mysore Medal.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for from 2005 to 2015, representing parts of Montgomery County and Northeast Philadelphia. She was also National Chair for Recruitment and Candidate Services for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In the 2014 election, Schwartz was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Pennsylvania. Early life, education, and health care career Schwartz was born Allyson Young in Queens, New York, to Everett and Renee (née Perl) Young. Her mother left Vienna in 1938 after Germany annexed Austria, and came to the United States, where she settled at a Jewish foster home in Philadelphia. Her father was a dentist in Flushing, Queens, and a veteran of the Korean War. She has a brother, Neal, and two sisters, Nancy and Dale. Schwartz graduated from the Calhoun School, on the Upper West Side of New York City, in 1966 and then enrolled at Simmons College in Boston, Massachusetts. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Simmons in 1970, as well as a Master of Social Work degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1972. She worked as assistant director of the Philadelphia Health Services Department from 1972 to 1975, and executive director of the Elizabeth Blackwell Center, a reproductive health clinic in Philadelphia, from 1975 to 1988. Pennsylvania Senate =Electoral history= In 1990, Schwartz ran for Pennsylvania's 4th senate seat, based in Northwest and Northeast Philadelphia. She won the Democratic primary with 50% of the vote, defeating Jeff Blum (28%) and Robert Blasi (22%). In the general election, Schwartz defeated incumbent Republican State Senator Joe Rocks 58%–42%. Redistricting pushed Schwartz's seat into Montgomery County. In 1994, she won re-election to a second term by defeating Republican Tom Scott 82%–18%. In 1998, she won re-election to a third term unopposed. In 2002, she won re-election to a fourth term defeating Republican Ron Holt, the Montgomery County Register of Wills, 82%–18%. =Tenure= During her first term, Schwartz was instrumental in Pennsylvania's legislative efforts to provide health care coverage to the children of middle-class families, leading to the creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1992. CHIP served as the model for the federal plan that now provides health insurance to millions of children. In a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, she was named the \\"Best Dressed,\\" to which she responded \\"I appreciate the honor...it must be the scarves.\\" 2000 U.S. Senate election In 2000, she decided to challenge Republican U.S. Senator Rick Santorum. Pittsburgh-area U.S. Congressman Ron Klink won the crowded, six-candidate Democratic primary with a plurality of 41% of the vote. Schwartz ranked second with 27% of the vote, dominating the southeastern part of the state, most notably Philadelphia (60%) and Montgomery (62%) counties. She also won two counties outside of the region: Centre (33%) and Union (38%). However, this was not enough to overcome Klink's dominance in the western part of the state. Schwartz did not have to give up her state senate seat to run in the Democratic primary for the U. S. Senate; Pennsylvania state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and Schwartz was not up for reelection until 2002. U.S. House of Representatives =Electoral history= In 2003, Democratic U.S. Congressman Joe Hoeffel, of Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district decided not to run for a fourth term, in order to challenge Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter. Schwartz had originally planned to run for Auditor General, but changed her plans after Hoeffel's announcement. In early 2004, she moved from Philadelphia to Jenkintown, Pennsylvania in Montgomery County, where she still lives today. She won the Democratic primary, narrowly defeating former Philadelphia deputy mayor and National Constitution Center director Joe Torsella 52%–48%. She won 62% of Montgomery while Torsella won 57% of Philadelphia. While most former state legislators raise comparatively more money through PACs than individual donations, she raised $4,597,032Pennsylvania Congressional Races in 2008 from individual donations and comparatively little ($558,376) in PAC donations. The 13th had historically been a classic Northeastern \\"Yankee Republican\\" district, but had become increasingly Democratic in recent years, especially after it was pushed into Philadelphia after the 2000 census. A Republican presidential candidate has not carried it since 1988, and it has been in Democratic hands for all but four years since 1993. In the general election, she defeated Republican Melissa Brown 56% to 41%, winning both counties. In 2006, Schwartz was re- elected to a second term, defeating Raj Bhakta, a contestant on The Apprentice 2, 66% to 34%. In 2008, she was re-elected to a third term, defeating Republican attorney Marina Kats, 63% to 35%. In 2010, she was reelected a fourth time, defeating businessman Dee Adcock 56% to 44%. The 12-point winning margin was the smallest in her congressional career. In 2012, after redistricting, Schwartz's district was given a larger Democratic majority when it was pushed further into Philadelphia, with 52% of the district's vote cast in Philadelphia. She won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Republican Joe Rooney 69% to 31%. =Tenure= Schwartz was a member of the New Democrat Coalition and was the chair of the New Democrat Coalition Taskforce on Health. In this position, she had actively pushed for the greater use of interoperable and secure electronic prescribing systems throughout the country in an attempt to decrease medical errors as well as costs and liability to providers, health systems and patients. In January 2014, Schwartz resigned from the taskforce chairmanship in the New Democratic Coalition. The first piece of legislation Schwartz introduced after being elected to Congress focused on providing tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed veterans. The bill was signed into law in 2007. In 2011, Schwartz introduced the Hiring Our Veterans Act, which was signed into law by President Obama in November of that year. The Hiring Our Veterans Act increased the tax credit for employers that hire veterans with a service connected disability who have been unemployed for six months or more, veterans who have been unemployed for at least four weeks, and veterans, not necessarily with disability, who have been unemployed for at least six months. In 2012, Schwartz introduced the Servicemembers' Access to Justice Act to improve the enforcement of Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994. Schwartz was backed by Senator Bob Casey, who introduced this legislation in the Senate on May 23, 2012 (Schwartz, 2012). Schwartz was the first Democratic member of the House of Representatives to call for Rep. Anthony Weiner to resign following his photo scandal. Schwartz was known as one of the leading health care experts in government. She authored several key provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including increasing access to primary care, banning pre-existing conditions exclusions and allowing young adults to remain on their parent's health coverage. She is pro-choice and received a 100% rating from NARAL in 2011. She voted twice against Republican-led efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, and supported legislation requiring hospitals to provide emergency abortion care to women who could die without it. 2014 gubernatorial election Schwartz announced her intention to give up her House seat to challenge incumbent Republican Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, who was up for re-election in 2014. On April 8, 2013, Schwartz officially launched her campaign. In February 2013, Schwartz stated that she would not run for re-election for the United States House of Representatives. Ultimately, she was defeated by Tom Wolf in the Democratic primary. Later career After losing the Democratic primary for governor of Pennsylvania, Schwartz became the president and CEO of the Better Medicare Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group funded by health insurance companies. The organization is made up of more than 400,000 beneficiaries and over 140 ally organizations, including Meals on Wheels, the National Hispanic Medical Association, Consumer Action and National Minority Quality Forum. The organization has been criticized as a front group for the health insurance industry.

His treatment of Wilson was deemed unethical by Californian courts and was later dramatized in the 2014 biographical film Love & Mercy, in which Landy is portrayed by Paul Giamatti. As a teenager, Landy aspired to show business, briefly serving as an early manager for George Benson. During the 1960s, he began studying psychology, earning his doctorate at the University of Oklahoma. After moving to Los Angeles, he treated many celebrity clients, including musician Alice Cooper and actors Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, Maureen McCormick, and Gig Young. He also developed an unorthodox 24-hour regimen intended to stabilize his patients by micromanaging their lives with a team of counselors and doctors. Brian Wilson initially became a patient under Landy's program in 1975. Landy was soon discharged due to his burdensome fees. In 1982, Landy was re-employed as Wilson's therapist, subsequently becoming his executive producer, business manager, co-songwriter, and business adviser. Landy went on to co-produce Wilson's debut solo album Brian Wilson (1988) and its unreleased follow-up Sweet Insanity (1991), as well as allegedly ghostwriting portions of Wilson's disowned memoir Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story (1991). In 1989, the state of California revoked Landy’s professional license amidst accusations of ethical violations and patient misconduct. Wilson continued to see Landy until a 1992 restraining order barred Landy from contacting the musician ever again. After the 1990s, Landy continued a psychotherapy practice with licensure in New Mexico and Hawaii until his death. Early life and education Eugene Ellsworth Landy was born on November 26, 1934, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the only child of Jules C. Landy, a medical doctor and psychology professor, and Frieda Mae Gordon Landy, also a psychology professor. Eugene dropped out of school in the sixth grade, later claiming to be dyslexic. At age 16, he pursued a career in show business, producing a nationally syndicated radio show, and discovering 10-year-old George Benson. Landy briefly served as Benson's manager and worked odd jobs as a radio producer, promoting records and producing a single for Frankie Avalon. Honoring his parents' wishes, Landy resumed his psychiatric studies at Los Angeles City College, where he earned an AA in chemistry, and entered medical school at the National University of Mexico. After falling ill with dysentery, he switched to psychology. He earned a master's degree in psychology from the University of Oklahoma in 1967, completing his training with a PhD in 1968. Career and development of methods After completing his studies, Landy worked for the Peace Corps, eventually moving to Los Angeles to work as a drug counselor at Harbor Hospital and as a popular part-time instructor at San Fernando Valley State College. Landy began developing ideas for his 24-hour treatment program while engaging in postdoctoral work at Rancho Santa Fe. It was there that he practiced \\"marathon therapy\\", in which a therapist takes control of a group of people for a day or more. In 1968, he worked briefly as an intern at Gateways Hospital in Echo Park, Los Angeles, where he developed his methods further, experimenting with treatment on teenage drug abusers with varying degrees of success. He attributed his failures to having too little control over their nighttime activities; he tried evening rap groups and made himself available at all hours for talking therapies for their nocturnal anxiety attacks. Landy went on to call his new system milieu therapy. While serving the hospital, Landy became cultured in the lingo used by its teenagers. In 1971, he authored a book on hippie jargon called The Underground Dictionary, published by Simon & Schuster. Around 1972, Landy founded a Beverly Hills clinic, the Foundation for the Rechanneling of Emotions and Education (FREE). Interns employed at the clinic used Landy's approach on a partial basis. In the early 1970s, he also started penetrating Hollywood social circles, becoming a consultant on various television shows including The Bob Newhart Show. He soon began treating many celebrity clients, earning $200 an hour. Some of Landy's patients included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, who died in an apparent murder-suicide along with his wife in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, \\"I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I seem to be able to relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards.\\" Unusually, he had his own press kit. In 1988, psychiatrist and Landy colleague Sol Samuels described Landy as \\"a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict. ... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it.\\" Treatment of Brian Wilson =First treatment (1975–1976)= Brian Wilson producing the Beach Boys' album 15 Big Ones in 1976 Landy was initially hired to treat Brian Wilson by Wilson's wife Marilyn in 1975. Wilson publicly rebelled against the program, saying that the only reason that he went along with it was so that he would not be committed to a psychiatric facility. Beach Boys road manager Rick Nelson later claimed that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group. During the recording of the Beach Boys' album 15 Big Ones (1976), group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours. Another report suggested that Landy had asked for a percentage of the band's income. At Landy's insistence, Wilson appeared on Saturday Night Live, choosing to perform a solo piano rendition of \\"Good Vibrations\\" which received mixed feedback. Landy stood off-camera holding signs for Wilson that read \\"smile\\". He said that critics missed the point of this exercise, explaining that Wilson's performance \\"was a terrible thing\\" as a one-shot, but if he continued making appearances then he would have gradually overcome his stage fright. Steve Love, Wilson's cousin and band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as \\"the only major success\\" the Beach Boys had in recent years; \\"Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I had to leave the situation. ... I was interested in making Brian a whole human being; they [the Beach Boys management] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977.\\" In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, \\"I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it. ... [He had] control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife. ... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged a hell of a lot per month.\\" Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a different doctor. =Second treatment (1982–1992)= Wilson performing with the Beach Boys in 1983 In 1982, Wilson was brought back to Landy's care after overdosing on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs. Landy monitored Wilson's drug intake and used the psychiatrist Sol Samuels to prescribe Wilson medication. Landy's assistant Kevin Leslie stood with Wilson at every moment, earning Leslie the nickname \\"Surf Nazi\\". Leslie also gave Wilson medication at Landy's direction. Initially, Leslie was paid salary by Landy, but was eventually paid directly by Wilson. In 1988, Samuels took credit with performing the \\"actual supervision of the therapy ... giving the medication and the occasional psychotherapy as he needs it. What Gene has been doing is hiring the people to be with him, and so forth, much as a parent would do if asked to get some help in the house.\\" In the mid 1980s, Landy stated of Wilson, \\"I influence all of his thinking. I'm practically a member of the band ... [We're] partners in life.\\" Wilson later responded to popular allegations, \\"People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge.\\" Landy echoed: \\"He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody. ... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants.\\" An August 1988 issue of Rolling Stone states the following: Even though the Beach Boys had hired Landy, part of the regimen involved cutting Wilson's contact from the group, as Landy reasoned: \\"You can't deal with people who only want to use you.\\" Wilson said that \\"Dr. Landy doesn't like me to be in touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy.\\" For example, Brian remembered participating in an interview with his brother Carl Wilson, \\"and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten.\\" In 1986, Wilson met his future wife and manager Melinda Ledbetter, a Cadillac saleswoman and former model, while browsing through a car dealership. Six months after meeting Wilson, she had reported Landy to the state's attorney general, who informed her that nothing could be done without the cooperation of Wilson's family. Ledbetter felt that the family had been at their \\"rope's end\\" with Wilson, and that they did not know what to do to help him. She said that three years into their relationship, Landy ordered Wilson to sever ties with her. Music and business associations Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually, forcing Wilson's family members to devote some publishing rights to his fee. Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to them or not, which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. \\"It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in now, if you can go make this person well to go create some income ...'\\" Landy expressed similar views. \\"Saying that [I would share in future songwriting royalties] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll pay you a million dollars if you can get up and fly around the room.'\\" This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions. Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided. Afterward, Wilson paid Landy a salary of about $300,000 a year for advice on creative decisions. In late 1987, Landy and Wilson became creative partners in a company called Brains and Genius, a business venture where each member would contribute equally and share any profits from recordings, films, soundtracks, or books. Landy was then credited as co-writer and executive producer for Wilson's debut solo album, Brian Wilson, released in 1988. Co-producer Russ Titelman disparaged Landy's role in the album's creation, calling him disruptive and \\"anti-creative\\". Wilson's cousin and bandmate Mike Love denied Landy's claims that the Beach Boys were preventing Wilson from participating on their recordings, and believed that the reason Landy encouraged Wilson to pursue a solo career \\"was to destroy us. Then he would be the sole custodian of Brian's career and legacy.\\" Landy maintained that his songwriting collaborations on Brian Wilson earned him less than $50,000. For the publishing of Wilson's autobiographic memoir, Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story, Landy stood to earn 30% of its proceeds. The book glorifies Landy and its contents were challenged for plagiarism. Landy denied accusations that he was involved as a ghostwriter. Wilson later distanced himself from the book. In a 1995 court case, Wilson's lawyers argued that HarperCollins were aware that Wilson's statements in the book were either manipulated or written by Landy. State intervention Action was taken against Landy's professional practice as a result of the Beach Boys' and Wilson family's struggles for control. A former nurse and girlfriend of Wilson's brought Landy to the state's attention in 1984. The state was then aided by journals written by songwriter Gary Usher during a ten-month collaboration with Wilson. These journals depicted Wilson as a virtual captive dominated by Landy, who was determined to fulfill his show business ambitions through Wilson. By this time, Wilson had become Landy's only patient. In February 1988, the State of California Board of Medical Quality charged Landy with ethical and license code violations stemming from the improper prescription of drugs and various unethical personal and professional relationships with patients, citing one case of sexual misconduct with a female patient, along with Wilson's psychological dependency on Landy. Landy denied the allegations, but later admitted to one of the seven charges which accused him of wrongfully prescribing drugs to Wilson. Landy surrendered his psychological license, complying with an agreement made with the state of California, and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for the next two years. An August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: \\"was a ruse to get us to write a letter in his defense against the California authorities. We never wrote the letter, and Brian's public behavior continued to unsettle.\\" Landy and his colleagues said that his treatment of Wilson ended in February 1988 at the request of the state attorney general's office, but the deputy attorney who drafted the complaint reported that he was not aware of any such request, nor was the office advised that they sever Landy's relationship with Wilson. Co- producers of Wilson's solo album said they witnessed no changes, and Landy's assistants remained with Wilson. Sol Samuels said this was because Landy had little direct involvement with Wilson's treatment, and that it was instead the people Landy hired who continued to regulate Wilson's medication. According to songwriter P. F. Sloan, Landy took advantage of Sloan's disappearance and claimed at one point to be the real P. F. Sloan. He explains that it was an attempt by Landy to gain credibility and appease members of the medical community who were questioning why Landy felt that he was an appropriate songwriting collaborator for Wilson. Conservatorship hearings Brian was granted a restraining order against Landy shortly after concerns were brought to his brother Carl (pictured 1983) Peter Reum, a therapist who met Wilson while attending a Beach Boys fan convention in 1990, was alarmed by Wilson's demeanor and speculated that he may be suffering from tardive dyskinesia, a neurological condition brought on by prolonged usage of antipsychotic medication. Reum phoned biographer David Leaf, who then reported Reum's observations to Carl Wilson. It was then discovered that Landy had been named as a chief beneficiary in a 1989 revision of Brian's will, collecting 70%, with the remainder split between his girlfriend and Brian's two daughters. This discovery was made by Kay Gilmer, a publicist employed by Landy in March 1990. She phoned Gary Usher to explain why his messages were not being returned, to which Usher warned: \\"If Landy knows that you're calling me, he'd kill you. He'd literally kill you.\\" Gilmer left her job two weeks later, taking expired drug bottles as well as names, phone numbers, and bank account information that she later turned over to the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance. Aided by Gilmer's findings, Brian's cousin Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A press conference with Stan at the lectern featured an unexpected appearance from Brian. While reading from a piece of paper, Brian was given a microphone and said: \\"I have heard of the charges made by Stan Love, and I think they are outrageous, which means they are out of the ballpark ... I feel great.\\" In a later interview from 1991, Brian acknowledged the revision of his will and repeatedly stated, \\"We might change that\\". Audree, Carl, Carnie, and Wendy Wilson contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991. Brian responded in an interview, \\"They probably want control of me, but they will not get it, they will not get it. I say let sleeping dogs lie. If the formula works, don't goof with it. That's one of my major philosophies in life. It's been working.\\" The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday. Landy estimated that, from 1983 to 1991, his fees had cost Wilson approximately $3 million. In 1991, Wilson told reporters that his prescribed medications included Cogentin, Eskalith, Xanax, Navane, and Serentil. =Love & Mercy= Landy's treatment of Wilson in the 1980s was dramatized in the 2014 biographical film Love & Mercy, in which Landy is portrayed by Paul Giamatti. These events are told from the point of view of Wilson's then-girlfriend Melinda Ledbetter. Landy's son Evan disputed the film's accuracy, believing that his father was unfairly portrayed. Mike Love commented that Evan's account was \\"very interesting because you get an intimate look at someone who was with Brian every day for a few years\\". Although he had not watched the film, he also said that it overstated Ledbetter's role in stopping the treatment. Screenwriter Oren Moverman stated that virtually everything in the 1980s portions was sourced from conversations he had with Ledbetter. He felt that Landy was the most difficult character to write for, \\"even though many things that he says in the movie I actually have recording of, in real life he was a cartoon and in real life he was so over the top.\\" Giamatti said he prepared for the role by meeting Landy's early career acquaintances and listening to hours of tapes where \\"he'd just keep talking and talking, in these completely huge paragraphs. They were brilliant-sounding, but if you dug into them they didn't make much sense.\\" Personal life and death Landy had one son in the early 1960s, Evan Landy. After the 1990s, Landy continued a psychotherapeutic practice with licensure in New Mexico and Hawaii up until his death. He died, aged 71, on March 22, 2006 in Honolulu, Hawaii, of pneumonia while suffering from lung cancer. Legacy In 1995, music producer Don Was commented that Wilson was \\"so different from his public image as a drug burnout or of someone catatonic and propped up by a greedy psychologist. ... I knew Landy. I was around for the tail end of it, and I saw some gray in there; he wasn't just this evil guy who took over Brian.\\" When asked what his reaction to Landy's death had been, Wilson responded: \\"I was devastated.\\" In 2015, Wilson reflected, \\"I thought he was my friend, but he was a very fucked- up man,\\" and also, \\"I still feel that there was benefit. I try to overlook the bad stuff, and be thankful for what he taught me.\\" References Bibliography  * * Further reading * Category:1934 births Category:2006 deaths Category:American psychologists Category:American psychotherapists Category:American psychology writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Hawaii Category:California State University, Los Angeles alumni Category:California State University, Northridge faculty Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Los Angeles City College alumni Category:Writers from Pittsburgh Category:University of Oklahoma alumni Category:People with dyslexia Category:Infectious disease deaths in Hawaii Category:20th-century psychologists Category:Music controversies ","title":"Eugene Landy"},{"id":"1147077","text":"The Fourth Anglo–Mysore War was a conflict in South India between the Kingdom of Mysore against the British East India Company and the Hyderabad Deccan in 1798–99. This was the final conflict of the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. The British captured the capital of Mysore. The ruler Tipu Sultan was killed in the battle. Britain took indirect control of Mysore, restoring the Wodeyar Dynasty to the Mysore throne (with a British commissioner to advise him on all issues). Tipu Sultan's young heir, Fateh Ali, was sent into exile. The Kingdom of Mysore became a princely state in a subsidiary alliance with British India covering parts of present Kerala-Karnataka and ceded Coimbatore, Dakshina Kannada and Uttara Kannada to the British. Background Napoleon's landing in Egypt in 1798 was intended to further the capture of the British possessions in India, and the Kingdom of Mysore was a key to that next step, as the ruler of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, sought France as an ally and his letter to Napoleon resulted in the following reply, \\"You have already been informed of my arrival on the borders of the Red Sea, with an innumerable and invincible army, full of the desire of releasing and relieving you from the iron yoke of England.\\" Additionally, General Malarctic, French Governor of Mauritius, issued the Malarctic Proclamation seeking volunteers to assist Tipu. Horatio Nelson crushed any help from Napoleon after the Battle of the Nile. However, Lord Wellesley had already set in motion a response to prevent any alliance between Tipu Sultan and France. Course of Events Three armies – one from Bombay and two British (one of which contained a division that was commanded by Colonel Arthur Wellesley, the future 1st Duke of Wellington), marched into Mysore in 1799 and besieged the capital, Srirangapatnam, after some engagements with Tipu. On 8 March, a forward force managed to hold off an advance by Tipu at the Battle of Seedaseer. On 4 May, in the Battle of Seringapatam, broke through the defending walls. Tipu Sultan, rushing to the breach, was shot and killed. Today, the spot where Tipu's body was discovered under the eastern gate has been fenced off by the Archaeological Survey of India, and a plaque erected. The gate was later demolished during the 19th century to lay a wide road. One notable military advance championed by Tipu Sultan was the use of mass attacks with iron-cased rocket brigades in the army. The effect of the Mysorean rockets on the British during the Third and Fourth Mysore Wars was sufficiently impressive to inspire William Congreve to develop the Congreve rockets. Many members of the British East India Company believed that Umdat Ul-Umra, the Nawab of Carnatic, secretly provided assistance to Tipu Sultan during the Fourth Anglo–Mysore War; and they immediately sought his deposition after the end of the conflict. =Nawab of Savanur= Territory of the Nawab of Savanur were split among the English and Maratha forces. Mysorean rockets During the war, rockets were again used on several occasions. One of these involved Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later famous as the First Duke of Wellington. Wellesley was defeated by Tipu's Diwan, Purnaiah, at the Battle of Sultanpet Tope. Quoting Forrest, > At this point (near the village of Sultanpet, Figure 5) there was a large > tope, or grove, which gave shelter to Tipu's rocketmen and had obviously to > be cleaned out before the siege could be pressed closer to Srirangapattana > island. The commander chosen for this operation was Col. Wellesley, but > advancing towards the tope after dark on the 5 April 1799, he was set upon > with rockets and musket-fires, lost his way and, as Beatson politely puts > it, had to \\"postpone the attack\\" until a more favourable opportunity should > offer.Forrest D (1970) Tiger of Mysore, Chatto & Windus, London The following day, Wellesley launched a fresh attack with a larger force, and took the whole position without losing a single man. On 22 April 1799, twelve days before the main battle, rocketeers worked their way around to the rear of the British encampment, then 'threw a great number of rockets at the same instant' to signal the beginning of an assault by 6,000 Indian infantry and a corps of Frenchmen, all directed by Mir Golam Hussain and Mohomed Hulleen Mir Miran. The rockets had a range of about 1,000 yards. Some burst in the air like shells. Others, called ground rockets, would rise again on striking the ground and bound along in a serpentine motion until their force was spent. According to one British observer, a young English officer named Bayly: \\"So pestered were we with the rocket boys that there was no moving without danger from the destructive missiles ...\\". He continued: > The rockets and musketry from 20,000 of the enemy were incessant. No hail > could be thicker. Every illumination of blue lights was accompanied by a > shower of rockets, some of which entered the head of the column, passing > through to the rear, causing death, wounds, and dreadful lacerations from > the long bamboos of twenty or thirty feet, which are invariably attached to > them. During the conclusive British attack on Srirangapattana on 2 May 1799, a British shot struck a magazine of rockets within Tipu Sultan's fort, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements. On the afternoon of 4 May when the final attack on the fort was led by Baird, he was again met by \\"furious musket and rocket fire\\", but this did not help much; in about an hour's time the fort was taken; perhaps within another hour Tipu had been shot (the precise time of his death is not known), and the war was effectively over. In popular culture The war, specifically the Battle of Mallavelly and the Siege of Seringapatam, with many of the key protagonists, is covered in the historical novel Sharpe's Tiger by Bernard Cornwell.

As of fall 2019, the university enrolled 8,279 undergraduates and 2,079 postgraduates, for a total enrollment of 10,348 students. The university is northeast of Pittsburgh. It is governed by a local Council of Trustees and the Board of Governors of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. IUP has branch campuses at Punxsutawney, Northpointe, and Monroeville. IUP is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. History Breezedale Hall IUP was conceived as Indiana Normal School, first chartered in 1871 by Indiana County investors. The school was created under the Normal School Act, which passed the Pennsylvania General Assembly on May 20, 1875.John Edward Merryman, \\"The Indiana Story 1875–1975: Pennsylvania's First State University...\\" Indiana Printing and Publishing Co., Indiana, Pennsylvania (1976), p. 18 Normal schools established under the act were to be private corporations in no way dependent upon the state treasury. They were to be \\"state\\" normal schools only in the sense of being officially recognized by the commonwealth.Merryman, \\"The Indiana Story\\", p. 20. The school opened its doors in 1875 following the mold of the French École Normale. It enrolled just 225 students. All normal school events were held within a single building which also contained a laboratory school for model teaching. Control and ownership of the institution passed to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1920. In 1927, by authority of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, it became State Teachers College at Indiana, with the right to grant degrees. As its mission expanded, the name was changed again in 1959 to Indiana State College. In 1965, the institution achieved university status and became Indiana University of Pennsylvania, or IUP.\\"A Long Tradition\\" available at IUP.edu (Mar 29, 2008).  Enrollment  IUP total enrollment peaked in the Fall of 2012 at 15,379 and declined steadily since, reporting a total enrollment of 12,316 for the Fall of 2017. This decline in enrollment caused financial difficulties for the university which struggled to cover costs for its 2010 dormitory expansion.\\"IUP, FIUP struggle with declining enrollments\\" available at (Mar 13, 2017). More recent enrollment statistics shows a total of 10,636 students.

This group works to furnish the Oak Grove with flora native to the region.Steback, Meredith Ann. \\"IUP to be site of area arboretum\\", The Penn (June 25, 2003). The university also operates an Academy of Culinary Arts in Punxsutawney and a police academy at its main campus. The university's Student Cooperative Association also owns College Lodge several miles from campus. It provides skiing, biking, hiking, and disc golfing opportunities. Boat access is also made available through the Cooperative Association. Over the last five years, IUP has demolished most of the 1970 era dormitories on campus. Demolition began during summer 2006 and facilities are being replaced with modern suites. Construction is ongoing with seven new dormitories completed for Fall 2009. Two more suite-style buildings were completed by Fall 2010.

The 2015 Washington Monthly College Rankings of National Universities ranks it at 226 out of 268. Athletics IUP's athletic department sponsors 19 varsity sports, including 8 for men and 11 for women. There are also club sports teams such as ice hockey and rugby. The Crimson Hawks, formerly known as the Indians, compete in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) of NCAA Division II. IUP annually produces teams and individuals that compete for championships on the conference, regional and national levels. The 2004–05 school year saw 12 sports either send their teams or individuals to NCAA postseason competition. The IUP football team has been to the NCAA Division II national title game twice (1990 and 1993). In both cases, IUP came up short, finishing the season as runner-up. While Division II teams rarely appear on television, IUP has appeared on regional telecasts in 1968 at the Boardwalk Bowl and 2006 against California University of PA. The team has also been on national TV while playing in those Division II national title games from 1990 and 1993. On November 2, 2006, a game against Slippery Rock was nationally televised on the TV channel, CSTV. Additionally, on September 15, 2011, a game against Bloomsburg was nationally televised on the TV channel CBS Sports Network as the NCAA Division II game of the week. The IUP men's basketball team likewise lost the NCAA Division II national title game twice in 2010 and 2015. The IUP rugby team finished 3rd in the Division I national championship in 2000, finishing behind California and Wyoming and ahead of fourth-place Army.

AD 30-AD 66) was the daughter and oldest surviving child of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the only child of his second wife Aelia Paetina. Antonia was a great great-niece of the Emperor Augustus, great-niece of the Emperor Tiberius, first cousin of the Emperor Caligula, half-sister to Claudia Octavia and Britannicus (her father's children by his third marriage to Valeria Messalina), and cousin, stepsister and sister-in-law of the Emperor Nero. Childhood and first marriage Until 37, she was raised by her paternal grandmother Antonia Minor (who died that year). From then until 43, she was raised by her father, who became Roman Emperor in 41. In 43, she first married Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, a descendant of Pompeia (daughter of Pompey the Great). His parents were consul Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi and Scribonia. According to Suetonius Pompeius was stabbed to death several years later (AD 46/47), when he was caught in bed with a favorite boy. Cassius Dio states that Antonia's stepmother Empress Valeria Messalina ordered his execution out of fear that Pompeius might become a rival to her son Britannicus. The death of Pompeius left Antonia free to marry Messalina's half-brother Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix. Second marriage and death Faustus Sulla and Antonia married in 47. They had a son who was frail and died before his second birthday. In 58, Faustus Sulla was exiled, and in 62 he was murdered at the order of the Emperor Nero. In 65, Tacitus records the rumour that Gaius Calpurnius Piso intended to marry Antonia, as an element of his conspiracy against Nero. After the death of the Empress Poppaea Sabina, Nero's second wife, Nero asked Antonia to marry him. When Antonia refused, Nero had her charged with an attempt of rebellion and executed. She was the last living grandchild of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, from whom Nero also was descended but one generation more distantly (i.e. their great-grandchild). Cultural depictions Antonia briefly appears in Robert Graves' novel Claudius the God, in the story she reveals that her first marriage with Gnaeus Pompey was never properly consummated in the two years they lived together, instead he forced her to take part in unnatural sexual practices. Claudius, outraged by this mistreatment of his daughter, orders Pompey's death (the only moment that he orders death for personal grievances). Antonia is surprised by this act as she thought her father cared more for his children with Messalina. Antonia and Pompey are omitted entirely in the 1976 television adaptation.

Vietnam is marked red. Darker blue represent the largest number of Vietnamese people living abroad by percents. Overseas Vietnamese (, which literally means \\"Overseas Vietnamese\\", or ', a Sino- Vietnamese word (越僑) literally translating to \\"Vietnamese sojourner\\") refers to Vietnamese people living outside Vietnam in a diaspora, by far the largest community of which live in the United States. The official number of the Vietnamese diasapora is about 4.5 million Overseas Vietnamese. A majority left Vietnam as economic and political refugees after the 1975 capture of Saigon and the North Vietnamese takeover of the pro-U.S. South Vietnam. The Vietnamese diaspora is the fifth largest Asian diaspora, after the Overseas Chinese, Indian diaspora, Overseas Filipinos and Lebanese diaspora. \\"Việt Kiều\\" (literally translating to \\"Vietnamese sojourner\\") is used by people in Vietnam to refer to ethnic Vietnamese living outside the country. However, many Overseas Vietnamese also use the term ' (literally translating to Overseas Vietnamese), or ' (Vietnamese with Freedom). An alternate label is used within Vietnam is \\"Người Việt Nam ở nước ngoài\\", which means, \\"ethnic Vietnamese who live in foreign countries\\". History Overseas Vietnamese can be generally divided into distinct categories: *The first category consists of people who have been living in territories outside of Vietnam prior to 1975; they usually reside in neighboring countries, such as Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and China, as well as those who settled earlier in Korea and Japan until the French colonization. During the French colonial era, many Vietnamese also migrated to France as students or workers. These people are not often considered \\"Việt Kiều\\" by people residing in Vietnam. *The second category, consisting of the vast majority of overseas Vietnamese, are Vietnamese who fled Vietnam as refugees, after the end of the Vietnam War, along with their descendants. They usually reside in countries such as those in North America, the European Union, Hong Kong, and Australia.http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/vietnam/documents/eu_vietnam/vn_migration_abroad_en.pdf *The third category consists of Vietnamese working and studying in the former Soviet bloc who opted to stay there after the Soviet collapse. This group is the second largest Vietnamese diaspora group, found mainly in the European Union (particularly countries formerly aligned with the Soviet Union in the Warsaw Pact and/or Comecon) and the Russian Federation.http://www.ceemr.uw.edu.pl/vol-4-no-1-june-2015/editorial/vietnamese- communities-central-and-eastern-europe-part-global *The fourth category consists of economic migrants who work in regional Asian countries such as Taiwan and Japan. This includes Vietnamese brides who married men from Taiwan and South Korea through illegal marriage agencies. There is social tension, controversy and criticism about these marriage agencies and their likeness to human trafficking. Many Vietnamese women encounter violent abuse by their foreign husbands. *The fifth category consists of Vietnamese people living in the MENA, in particular the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Morocco, Qatar and Kuwait. These population of Vietnamese people are those who may have studied in Europe or otherwise and have sought work in other countries.https://simply- morocco.com/vietnamese-women-in-morocco-what-are-they-doing- there/http://baobinhduong.vn/en/vietnamese-in-uae-eager-to-cheer-on-national- football-team-at-asian- cup-a194270.htmlhttps://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/04/02/2019/Vietnamese- expatriates-feel-safe-in-Qatarhttp://dangcongsan.vn/nguoi-viet-nam-o-nuoc- ngoai/cong-dong-nguoi-viet-nam-tai-ai-cap-mot-long-huong-ve-to- quoc-535850.html A 2014 report from the Associated Press said that \\"women make up at least two-thirds of workers who leave the country,\\" and sometimes leave fathers behind to care for children. The report also said that \\"the total amount of remittances sent back from all Vietnamese workers overseas now exceeds $2 billion a year.\\" Around the world =United States= Congregation Of The Mother Coredemptrix in Carthage, MissouriIn 2016 the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the Vietnamese American population to be 2,067,527. They tend to live in metropolitan areas in the West, especially in California and Texas. Significant areas where they are well represented include Orange County, California, San Jose, California, Houston, Texas, and Seattle, Washington. The group that left Vietnam after 1975 to escape the North Vietnam takeover are generally antagonistic towards the government of Vietnam. In 2015, 30% of Vietnamese Americans had attained a bachelor's degree or higher. Specifically, 21% of Vietnamese Americans had attained a bachelor's degree (37% for U.S. born Vietnamese and 18% for Foreign born Vietnamese) and 8.9% had attained a Postgraduate degree (14% for U.S. born Vietnamese and 7% for Foreign born Vietnamese) compared to 19% Bachelor's degree attainment and 11% Postgraduate degree attainment among the American population in general. =Cambodia= Vietnamese constitute about 5% of the population of Cambodia, making them the largest ethnic minority. Vietnamese people began migrating to Cambodia as early as the 17th century. In 1863, when Cambodia became a French colony, many Vietnamese were brought to Cambodia by the French to work on plantations and occupy civil servant positions. During the Lon Nol Regime (1970–1975) and Pol Pot regime (1975–1979), many of the Vietnamese living in Cambodia were killed. Others were either repatriated or escaped to Vietnam or Thailand. During the ten-year Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia from 1979 until 1989 many of the Vietnamese who had previously lived in Cambodia returned. Along with them came friends and relatives. Also, many former South Vietnamese soldiers came to Cambodia fleeing persecution from the communist government. Many living in Cambodia usually speak Vietnamese as their first language and have introduced the Cao Dai religion with 2 temples built in Cambodia. Many Cambodians learned Vietnamese as a result. They are concentrated in the Kratie and Takeo provinces of Cambodia, where there are villages predominately of ethnic Vietnamese. Vietnamese people are also the top tourist in Cambodia, with 130,831, up 19 percent as of 2011.Cambodia receives 778,467 int'l tourists in Q1, up 14% . News.xinhuanet.com (2011-05-03). Retrieved on 2011-05-30. =France= The Temple du Souvenir Indochinois in the Bois de Vincennes, erected in 1907, is a monument built by the earliest waves of Vietnamese migrants to France. The number of ethnic Vietnamese living in France is estimated to be about 350,000 as of 2014. France was the first Western country to where Vietnamese migrants settled due to the colonization of Vietnam by France that began in the late 1850s.Nguyen Quy Dao, La diaspora vietnamienne et sa coopération avec le Vietnam, 2013 (in French) During the colonial period, there was a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France, as well as professional and blue-collar workers, with many settling permanently.La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier (in French) The country would continue to be home to by far the largest overseas Vietnamese population outside Asia until the 1980s, when a higher number of Vietnam War refugees resettled in the United States.Blanc, Marie-Eve. Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World, Springer, pp. 1158–1166, 2004. A number of Vietnamese loyal to the colonial government and Vietnamese married to French colonists emigrated to France following Vietnam's independence through the Geneva Accords in 1954. During the Vietnam War, a significant number of students and those involved in commerce from South Vietnam continued to arrive in France. However, the largest influx of Vietnamese people arrived in France as refugees after the Fall of Saigon and end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Vietnamese refugees who settled in France usually had higher levels of education and affluence than the Vietnamese refugees who settled in North America, Australia, and the rest of Europe, likely due to cultural familiarity with French culture and that many affluent Vietnamese families had already settled in France. Most Vietnamese in France live in Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France area, but a sizeable number also reside in the major urban centers in the south-east of the country, primarily Marseille and Lyon, as well as Toulouse. Earlier Vietnamese migrants also settled in the cities of Lille and Bordeaux. In contrast to their counterparts in the English-speaking world, the Vietnamese in France have a higher degree of assimilation, due to cultural, historical, and linguistic knowledge of the host country. The community is still strongly attached to its homeland while being well integrated in the French society. The generation of Vietnamese refugees continues to hold on to traditional values. The later generations of French-born Vietnamese strongly identify with the French culture rather than Vietnamese, as most were raised and brought up in the French system rather than the Vietnamese one. French media and politicians generally view the Vietnamese community as a \\"model minority\\", in part because they are represented as having a high degree of integration within the French society as well as having high economic and academic success. Furthermore, Vietnamese in France on average have a high level of educational attainment and success, a legacy dating back to the colonial era when affluent families and those with connections to the French colonial government sent their children to France to study.La diaspora vietnamienne (in French) The Vietnamese community in France is divided between those who oppose the communist Hanoi government and those who are supportive of it.Bousquet p. 5Helping the World's homeless; Vietnamese in France proud, divided The Christian Science Monitor, 1980 The pro-communist camp is the more established of the two and was the larger group until the 1970s, and consists mainly of students, workers, and long-established immigrants who arrived before 1975 and their descendants. Meanwhile, the anti-communist camp consists of students, refugees, and middle class immigrants from the former south, who began to arrive after Vietnamese independence in 1954 but most of which fled Vietnam after 1975. This division in the community has been present since the 1950s, when some Vietnamese students and workers in France supported and praised the communist Vietminh's policies back home, while Vietnamese loyal to the colonial or non-communist governments and immigrated to France were largely anti-communist. This political rift remained minor until the Fall of Saigon in 1975, when staunchly anti-communist refugees from South Vietnam arrived and established community networks and institutions. The two camps have contradictory political goals and ideologies and members of one group rarely interact with members of the other group. Such political divisions have prevented the Vietnamese in France from forming a strong, unified community in their host nation, as their counterparts have in North America and Australia. =Australia= Vietnamese people in Australia constitute one of the largest ethnic groups in Australia, with 294,798 people claiming Vietnamese ancestry at the 2016 census.http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/036?opendocument First generation Vietnamese Australians who came as refugees varied widely in income and social class. Of those from the Vietnam War era, many Vietnamese Australians are white collar professionals, while others work primarily in blue-collar jobs. Australian-born Vietnamese tend to experience high levels of educational attainment and success. In 2001, the labour participation rate for Vietnamese refugees was 61%, about the same as that of Australian born residents (63%).1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2005. Abs.gov.au. Retrieved on 2011-05-30. Around three quarters of ethnic Vietnamese live in New South Wales (40.7%) and Victoria (36.8%). The surname, Nguyễn, is the seventh most common family name in Australia (second to Smith in the Melbourne phone book). =Canada= According to the 2016 census, Canada has 240,615 people who identify as ethnically Vietnamese. The majority of Vietnamese people in Canada reside in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, with some having lived in Quebec before 1975. Vancouver is also another major destination for newly arrived Vietnamese immigrants since 1980, including Vietnamese of Chinese descent, with the city having a large Chinese population. =Germany= Vietnamese comprise the largest Asian ethnic group in Germany.Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschland – Startseite. Destatis.de (2008-10-20). Retrieved on 2011-05-30. As of 2011, there are about 137,000 people of Vietnamese descent in Germany.Süddeutsche: Vietnamesen in Deutschland: \\"Nur Bildung führt weg vom Reisfeld\\"Bernd Wolf (2007): The Vietnamese diaspora in Germany; Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit In western Germany, most Vietnamese arrived in the 1970s or 1980s as refugees from the Vietnam War. The comparatively larger Vietnamese community in eastern Germany traces its origins to assistance agreements between the East German and the North Vietnamese government. Under these agreements, guest workers from Vietnam were brought to East Germany, where they soon made up the largest immigrant group, and were provided with technical training. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, many stayed in Germany, although they often faced discrimination, especially in the early years following reunification. As in France, the Vietnamese community is divided between anticommunists in the former West (including the former West Berlin) and pro-communists in the former East, although the difference runs along former border lines rather than being diffused as in France. =Czech Republic= The number of Vietnamese people in the Czech Republic was estimated at 61,012 at the 2009 census, although more recent figures have placed the number to as high as 80,000.Miroslav Nozina, The Dragon & the Lion: Vietnamese Organized Crime in the Czech Republic, Think Magazine Most Vietnamese immigrants in the Czech Republic reside in Prague, where there is an enclave called \\"Sapa\\". Unlike Vietnamese immigrants in Western Europe and North America, these immigrants were usually communist cadres studying or working abroad who decided to stay after the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. The Vietnamese surname Nguyen is even listed as the most common of foreign surnames in the Czech Republic and is the 9th most common surname in the country overall. =United Kingdom= Vietnamese residing in the United Kingdom number around 55,000 people, which is in contrast to the trend of the UK tending to have the largest East and South East Asian diasporas in Europe. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher agreed to take quotas of refugees and 12,000 boat people came to Britain The most established Vietnamese communities in Britain are in Hackney and other parts of London. There are also communities in Birmingham, Manchester and other major UK cities. In addition to the official 4,5 million Vietnamese abroad recognized, there is also an underreported number of illegal Vietnamese immigrants abroad in the United Kingdom, a part of wordwide criminial activities resembling modern slavery.https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3962556https://abcnews.go.com/International/6000-mile- journey-scores-vietnamese-migrants-smuggled-trafficked/story?id=67318722 Many Vietnamese, lacking official papers and denied of official assistances, unfortunately may become involved in criminal activities, such as becoming hired in cannabis factories unknowningly.https://www.france-terre- asile.org/images/stories/publications/pdf/En_route_to_the_United_Kingdom_- _a_field_survey_of_vietnamese_migrants.pdf The Essex lorry deaths highlighted the issue of illegal Vietnamese immigrants being smuggled from poverty- stricken regions of Vietnam to other places of the world.https://theconversation.com/how-to-prevent-the-deaths-of-more- vietnamese-migrants-trying-to-reach-britain-125989 =Poland= Around 50,000 Vietnamese live in Poland, mostly in big cities. They publish a number of newspapers, both pro- and anti-Communist. The first immigrants were Vietnamese students at Polish universities in the post-World War II era. These numbers increased slightly during the Vietnam War, when agreements between the communist Vietnamese and Polish governments allowed Vietnamese guest workers to receive industrial training in Poland. A large number of Vietnamese immigrants also arrived after 1989. =Belgium= An estimated 14,000 ethnic Vietnamese reside in Belgium as of 2012. Similarly to the Vietnamese community in France, the Vietnamese Belgian community traces its roots to before the end of the Vietnam War. Beginning in the mid-1960s, Belgium became a popular alternative destination to France for South Vietnamese seeking higher education and career opportunities abroad. A much larger influx of Vietnamese arrived as refugees following the Fall of Saigon. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, a small number of Vietnamese workers in former Soviet Bloc countries who were sponsored by the communist Vietnamese government also sought asylum in Belgium.Regard sur la communauté vietnamienne en Belgique The Vietnamese Belgian population largely resides in and around the capital of Brussels or in the southern French-speaking Wallonia region, especially around the city of Liège. As in France, South Vietnamese refugees to Belgium were largely of higher social standing and integrated much easier into their host country's society than their peers who settled in North America, Australia and the rest of Europe due to better linguistic and cultural knowledge. The Vietnamese Belgian community is strongly attached to its counterpart community in France, with both communities largely achieving higher socioeconomic success in their host countries than other overseas Vietnamese populations. =Russia= Vietnamese people in Russia form the 72nd-largest ethnic minority community in Russia according to the 2002 census. The Census estimated their population at only 26,205 individuals, making them one of the smaller groups of Việt Kiều. However, unofficial estimates put their population as high as 100,000 to 150,000. =Norway= An estimated 21,700 ethnic Vietnamese live in Norway as of 2014, and the country has hosted a Vietnamese community since refugee arrivals after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. The Vietnamese are considered one of the best integrated non-western immigrant groups in Norway, with high rates of Norwegian citizenship among immigrants and success rates in education on par with those of ethnic Norwegians. =Netherlands= About 19,000 ethnic Vietnamese reside in the Netherlands according to a 2010 estimate. The community largely consists of South Vietnamese refugees who first arrived in 1978. A much smaller number of North Vietnamese workers also arrived from eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. =Bulgaria= An estimated 2,600 ethnic Vietnamese live in Bulgaria according to a 2015 estimate. Under international agreements in 1980, Bulgaria, along with other Warsaw Pact members, accepted Vietnamese guest workers who were sponsored by the communist government into the country as a relatively cheaper manual labour workforce. At one point, over 35,000 Vietnamese people worked in Bulgaria between 1980 and 1991, and many Vietnamese students completed their higher education at various Bulgarian universities. =South Korea= As of 2011, there were over 110,000 ethnic Vietnamese people in South Korea, making them the second largest minority group in the country. Vietnamese in South Korea consist mainly of migrant workers and women introduced to South Korean husbands through marriage agencies. In the 13th century, several thousand Vietnamese fled to Korea following the overthrow of the Vietnamese Lý Dynasty, where they were received by King Gojong of Goryeo. =Malaysia= The Fall of Saigon in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War saw many Vietnamese refugees escaping by boats to Malaysia. The first refugee boat arrived in Malaysia were in May 1975, carrying 47 people.Last Vietnamese boat refugee leaves Malaysia, 30 August 2005, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, retrieved 17 September 2013 A refugee camp was established later at Pulau Bidong in August 1978 with the assistance of the United Nations, and became a major refugee processing center for Vietnamese seeking residency in other countries. While a very small number of Vietnamese refugees settled in Malaysia, the majority of Vietnamese in Malaysia consist of skilled and semi-skilled workers who arrived during the 1990s as economic cooperation between Vietnam and Malaysia increased. =Taiwan= Vietnamese form one of the largest foreign ethnic groups in Taiwan, with a resident population of around 200,000. Including students and migrant workers, the Vietnamese population in Taiwan is about 200,000. Vietnamese in Taiwan largely arrived as workers in the manufacturing industry or domestic helpers. There are also a large number of Vietnamese women married to Taiwanese men through international matchmaking services in Vietnam, despite the illegality of such services in the country. =Japan= Over 135,000 Vietnamese people resided in Japan at the end of 2014. In 2019, around 371,755 Vietnamese people lived in Japan, making it the third largest foreign community in the country. At least 190,000 are \\"skilled trainees\\" and this particular number is growing sharply. Vietnamese people first came to Japan as students beginning in the 20th century. However, the majority of the community is composed of refugees admitted in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as well as a smaller proportion of migrant laborers who began arriving in 1994. =Laos= As Vietnam and Laos are neighbors, there has been a long history of population migrations between the territories which make up the two respective countries. When Laos was a French protectorate during the first half of the 20th century, the French colonial administration brought many Vietnamese people to Laos to work as civil servants. This matter was the object of strenuous opposition by Laotian nationals, who in the 1930s made an unsuccessful attempt to replace the local government with Laotian civil servants. =China= The Vietnamese in China are known as the Gin ethnic group, and arrived in southeastern China beginning in the sixteenth century. They largely reside in the province of Guangxi and speak Vietnamese and a local variety of Cantonese. =Hong Kong= Vietnamese migration to Hong Kong began after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, when boat people took to the sea and began fleeing Vietnam in all directions. Those who landed in Hong Kong were placed in refugee camps until they could be resettled in a third country. Under the Hong Kong government's Comprehensive Plan of Action, newly arriving Vietnamese were classified as either political refugees or economic migrants. Those deemed to be economic migrants would be denied the opportunity for resettlement overseas. =Philippines= Many Vietnamese boat refugees who crossed the South China Sea landed in the Philippines after the fall of South Vietnam in 1975. These refugees established a community called Viet-Ville (French for \\"Viet-Town\\") in Puerto Princesa, Palawan. At the time, it became the centre of Vietnamese commerce and culture, complete with Vietnamese restaurants, shops, and Catholic churches and Buddhist temples. In the decades that followed however, the Vietnamese population dwindled greatly, with many having emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia, or Western Europe. Viet-Ville today remains a popular destination for local tourists. =Israel= Vietnamese refugees arriving at Ben-Gurion International Airport, In Israel The number of Vietnamese people in Israel is estimated at 150–200. Most of them arrived between 1976 and 1979, when about 360 Vietnamese refugees arrived when Prime Minister Menachem Begin granted them political asylum. Most of them later left Israel, mainly for Europe or North America to reunite with their extended families. Many of the second generation descendants have assimilated into Israeli culture, marrying Israelis, speaking Hebrew and serving in the Israel Defense Forces. A minority choose to keep their culture alive by shunning intermarriage and speaking Vietnamese at home.Where are Israel's Vietnamese refugees Today, the majority of the community lives in the Gush Dan area in the center of Israel but also a few dozen Vietnamese-Israelis or Israelis of Vietnamese origin live in Haifa, Jerusalem and Ofakim. Relations with Vietnam Relations between overseas Vietnamese populations and the current government of Vietnam traditionally range between polarities of geniality and overt contempt. Generally, overseas Vietnamese residing in North America, Western Europe, and Australia (which represent the vast majority of overseas Vietnamese populations) are virulently opposed to the existing government of Vietnam. However, the smaller population of overseas Vietnamese residing in Europe (mainly in Central and East Europe), Middle East, Africa and Asia, most of whom have been sent for training in formerly communist countries. These populations generally maintain positive or more neutral, if not very friendly relations with the government. Many of these East European Vietnamese are from northern Vietnam, and usually have personal or familial affiliations with the communist regime Those who left prior to the political exodus of 1975, largely residing in France, generally identify their sentiments as somewhere in between the two polarities. This division is also strongly reflected on their religious adherence, most Vietnamese diaspora living in Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand have been strongly Christians and very anti-communists, while the Vietnamese living in Eastern Europe, Asia, Middle East and Africa are more aligned to Buddhism and, in smaller scale, atheists and Muslims.https://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-01/vietnamese-diaspora The former South Vietnamese prime minister Nguyễn Cao Kỳ returned to Vietnam in 2004 and was generally positive about his experience. However, Ky's reconciliation was met with anger by most Overseas Vietnamese, who called him a traitor and a communist collaborator for reconciling and working with the current communist regime. Notable expatriate artists have returned to Vietnam to perform (many are met with scorn and boycott by the expatriate community itself after they have done so). Notably, the composer Pham Duy had returned to Ho Chi Minh City (referred to as Saigon by overseas Vietnamese and those living in Vietnam) to live the rest of his life there after living in Midway City, California since 1975. The government in Vietnam used less antagonistic rhetoric to describe those who left the country after 1975. According to the Vietnamese government, while in 1987 only 8,000 overseas Vietnamese returned to Vietnam for the purpose of visiting, that number jumped to 430,000 in 2004. The government enacted laws to make it easier for overseas Vietnamese to do business in Vietnam, including those allowing them to own land. However, overseas Vietnamese still face discrimination while trying to do business there. The first company in Vietnam to be registered to an Overseas Vietnamese was Highlands Coffee, a successful chain of specialty coffee shops, in 1998. In June 2007, Vietnamese president Nguyen Minh Triet visited the United States, one of his scheduled stops was within the vicinity Orange County, home of Little Saigon, the largest Vietnamese community outside of Vietnam. Details of his plans were not announced beforehand due to concerns of massive protests. Despite these efforts, a large crowd of anti-communist protest still occurred. Several thousand people protested in Washington, D.C. and Orange County during his visit. =Relations among Vietnamese diaspora= Due to this complicated nature of religious and social issues, there is also a significant level of tensions between Vietnamese diaspora community.https://vietnamnet.vn/vn/tuanvietnam/nguoi-viet-doan-ket-trong-nha- ghet-nhau-ngoai-ngo-279206.html Widespread racism exists between Vietnamese diaspora from North America and Western Europe against its brethren from the other parts of the world have been the result of frequent negative portrayal of majority former Soviet-aligned nations and Asian countries; most Vietnamese from Western Europe and North America have long viewed themselves as more civilized, more developed, and that only these countries provide the real ethics and human rights, and have a look down opinion on the remaining Vietnamese diaspora.https://www.voatiengviet.com/a/nguoi-viet-hai-ngoai-phan- ung-truoc-loi-keu-goi-dong- gop-/4911807.html?nocache=1&fbclid;=IwAR3bTkfLflHuUI- uraieANCtflErv-y8UytstORPs7JQvro0LUvlGCsO0iA Simutaneously, Vietnamese from Vietnam, other Asian countries and sometimes from Eastern Europe have long complained about racism caused by Vietnamese from Western Europe and North America.https://www.duhidoday.com/2019/02/03/nhung-viet-kieu-xau-tinh/ This was further exacerbated by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, with majority of Vietnamese living in Western Europe and North America are strongly pro-Trump attitudes while the remaining Vietnamese have developed a skeptical opinion on him.https://basamnguyenhuuvinh.wordpress.com/2020/08/28/1385-mot-cu-tri-my- goc-viet-duoc-melania-trump-cam-hoa/https://theconversation.com/why-some- vietnamese-americans-support-donald- trump-143978https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/skepticism-abounds-as-us-envoy- assures-vietnam-of-trump-administration-s- commitment-3604067.htmlhttp://aapidata.com/blog/2020-fav-caprimary/ See also *List of Vietnamese people *Vietnamese boat people *Growing Up American References External links *The Viet Kieu Experience *The Six Faces: Viet Kieu – Overseas Vietnamese *Viet kieu invest in 1,300 domestic projects *Viet Kieu in Vietnamese *Viet Kieu *Foreigners working and living in Vietnam *Foreigners buying property in Vietnam *Fund seeks to boost links with Viet kieu *Business Opportunities Draw Viet Kieu Back to Vietnam *Viet Kieu still discriminated against *A Viet Kieu Visits Her Homeland for the First Time *Viet Kieu by Andrew Lam *Overseas Vietnamese Science & Technology Club- in Vietnamese (needs volunteer to translate to English) *Reassessing what we collect website – Vietnamese London History of Vietnamese London with objects and images *Foreign Embassies in Vietnam ","title":"Overseas Vietnamese"},{"id":"1147109","text":"Laura Hillenbrand (born May 15, 1967) is an American author of books and magazine articles. Her two bestselling nonfiction books, Seabiscuit: An American Legend (2001) and Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption (2010), have sold over 13 million copies, and each was adapted for film. Her writing style is distinct from New Journalism, dropping \\"verbal pyrotechnics\\" in favor of a stronger focus on the story itself. Hillenbrand fell ill in college and was unable to complete her degree. She shared that experience in an award-winning essay, A Sudden Illness, published in The New Yorker in 2003. Her books were written while she was disabled by that illness. In a 2014 interview, Bob Schieffer said to Laura Hillenbrand: \\"To me your story – battling your disease... is as compelling as his (Louis Zamperini's) story.\\" Career Hillenbrand's first book was the acclaimed Seabiscuit: An American Legend (2001), a nonfiction account of the career of the great racehorse Seabiscuit, for which she won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year in 2001. She says she was compelled to tell the story because she \\"found fascinating people living a story that was improbable, breathtaking and ultimately more satisfying than any story [she'd] ever come across.\\" She first told the story through an essay, \\"Four Good Legs Between Us\\", that was published in American Heritage magazine, and the feedback was positive, so she decided to proceed with a full-length book. The book received positive reviews for the storytelling and research. It was made into the film Seabiscuit, nominated for Best Picture of 2003 at the 76th Academy Awards. Hillenbrand's second book, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption (2010), was a biography of World War II hero Louis Zamperini. The book's film adaptation is called Unbroken (2014). These two books have dominated the best seller lists in both hardback and paperback. Combined, they have sold more than 10 million copies, which was reported in 2016 to have increased to over 13 million copies. Hillenbrand's essays have appeared in The New Yorker, Equus magazine, American Heritage, The Blood- Horse, Thoroughbred Times, The Backstretch, Turf and Sport Digest, and other publications. Her 1998 American Heritage article on the horse Seabiscuit won the Eclipse Award for Magazine Writing. Hillenbrand is a co-founder of Operation International Children. Writing style Hillenbrand's writing style belongs to a new school of nonfiction writers, who come after the new journalism, focusing more on the story than a literary prose style: > Hillenbrand belongs to a generation of writers who emerged in response to > the stylistic explosion of the 1960s. Pioneers of New Journalism like Tom > Wolfe and Norman Mailer wanted to blur the line between literature and > reportage by infusing true stories with verbal pyrotechnics and eccentric > narrative voice. But many of the writers who began to appear in the 1990s > ... approached the craft of narrative journalism in a quieter way. They > still built stories around characters and scenes, with dialogue and interior > perspective, but they cast aside the linguistic showmanship that drew > attention to the writing itself. Personal life Hillenbrand was born in Fairfax, Virginia, the daughter and youngest of four children of Elizabeth Marie Dwyer, a child psychologist, and Bernard Francis Hillenbrand, a lobbyist who became a minister. Hillenbrand spent much of her childhood riding bareback \\"screaming over the hills\\" of her father's Sharpsburg, Maryland, farm. A favorite childhood book of hers was Come On Seabiscuit (1963). \\"I read it to death, my little paperback copy,\\" she says. She studied at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, but was forced to leave before graduation when she contracted chronic fatigue syndrome, with which she has struggled ever since. Until late 2015, she lived in Washington, D.C., and rarely left her house because of the condition. Hillenbrand married Borden Flanagan, a professor of government at American University and her college sweetheart, in 2006. In 2014, they separated after 28 years as a couple, living in separate homes. Their divorce was finalized in 2015. In January 2015, Hillenbrand was interviewed at length by James Rosen of Fox News, in her home in Georgetown, primarily about how she wrote the book Unbroken; Rosen noted her improved health, as the interview had been put off multiple times since 2010, on account of her ill health. She mentioned in the interview how her subject, Louis Zamperini, inspired her in facing her own life problems during their many phone calls, with his unfailing optimism. She related that Zamperini had read her essay about her own illness, which was partly why he opened up about his life so thoroughly, trusting that she could understand what he had endured. She stated that her primary literary influences were all writers of fiction, including Hemingway, Tolstoy, Jane Austen, but their command of language is what brings her to re-read books by those authors. In fall 2015, Hillenbrand made a trip by road to Oregon, her first time out of Washington D. C. since 1990 not resulting in totally debilitating vertigo. She lives in Oregon since that trip. She traveled across the US with her new boyfriend, making many stops along the way to see the country. She reports that taking the trip to \\"see America\\" was risky, but her preparations resulted in a successful trip and much joy from adding activities long absent from her life. This was made possible by a disciplined scheme over two years to increase her tolerance to travel without evoking the vertigo. The disease is not cured but her capacity is increased. Chronic fatigue syndrome Hillenbrand experienced the sudden onset of a then unknown sickness at 19. She was a sophomore at Kenyon College. Up until the symptoms struck, she was an avid tennis player, cycled in the nearby country and played football on the quad. One day driving back to school from spring break, she became violently ill. Three days later, she could hardly sit up in bed and she could not make the walk to classes. \\"Terrified, confused, she dropped out of school\\" and her sister drove her home. She shuttled from doctor to doctor for a year before being diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome at Johns Hopkins. She said it was the most hellish year of her life. Because the name of her illness does not represent the extent of the disease, in 2011 Hillenbrand said of her diagnosis: > This is why I talk about it. You can’t look at me and say I’m lazy or that > this is someone who wants to avoid working. The average person who has this > disease, before they got it, we were not lazy people; it’s very typical that > people were Type A and hard, hard workers. I was that kind of person. I was > working my tail off in college and loving it. It’s exasperating because of > the name, which is condescending and so grossly misleading. Fatigue is what > we experience, but it is what a match is to an atomic bomb. Hillenbrand's family and friends did not understand her sickness and pulled away, leaving Hillenbrand to battle an unknown disease on her own. She was met with ridicule and told she was lazy during the first ten years of her sickness. In 2014, she said, \\"'I was not taken seriously, and that was disastrous. If I’d gotten decent medical care to start out with — or at least emotional support, because I didn’t get that either — could I have gotten better? Would I not be sick 27 years later?'” She described the onset and early years of her illness in an award-winning essay, A Sudden Illness in 2003. The disease structured her life as a writer, keeping her mainly confined to her home. She read old newspaper articles by buying the old newspapers or borrowing them from libraries, rather than using microfilm or other forms of archived news articles, and did all her live interviews by telephone. On the irony of writing about physical paragons while being so incapacitated herself, Hillenbrand says, \\"I'm looking for a way out of here. I can't have it physically, so I'm going to have it intellectually. It was a beautiful thing to ride Seabiscuit in my imagination. And it's just fantastic to be there alongside Louie as he's breaking the NCAA mile record. People at these vigorous moments in their lives – it's my way of living vicariously.\\" In a 2014 interview, Bob Schieffer said to Laura Hillenbrand: To me your story – battling your disease ….is as compelling as his (Louis Zamperini’s) story. By the time of her January 2015 interview with Ken Rosen, her ability to function had improved after hitting a real low during the writing of Unbroken; she increased her ability to walk down her stairs by taking one step and returning to bed, then some days later, two steps, until she could go down the whole staircase, a process that took several months. When Rosen and his crew met her, she was not having trouble with her balance or with vertigo. When asked about her health, she reported having myalgic encephalomyelitis (M.E.), formerly called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. In 2015–2016, she reported changes in her health status in an interview with Paul Costello for Stanford Medicine: \\"Recently, Hillenbrand has made a lot of changes in her medical treatments and in her life. There’s optimism in her voice and a sense of wonderment at new beginnings.\\" Vertigo has been a serious problem for her, so that she had not left Washington D. C. since 1990 because of it. After a disciplined effort to tolerate riding in a car, starting at five minutes and increasing to two hours over two years, she was able to drive out of Washington D. C. after 25 years. She is not cured, \\"I was not well. I am not well. I am always dealing with symptoms,\\" [emphasis in original]. The changes in her health allowed her to make a cross-country trip to Oregon. She has also begun horseback riding and bicycle riding, two activities she had not done since the disease struck her in 1987.

With his immmense wisdom and through the struggle he faced due to the Caste based discrimination Jashuva has wrote the poetry with an Universal approach.For his contribution to the Telugu poetry and Society he was called as \\"Poet of the Millennium\\" for his timeless pieces of poetry and Literature. Early life Jashuva was born to Virayya and Lingamma in Vinukonda, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India to a community of leather workers. His father belonged to the Yadav caste and his mother belonged to the Madiga caste.Vepachedu Education foundation article on Jashua, Accessed 27 Oct 2013Suprasiddula jeevita viseshalu, Hanumcchastri JanamaddiSatajayanti saahitimoortulu, Sastri D (DN Sastri) Due to poverty and the intercaste marriage of his parents, his childhood was difficult in a society in which some castes were considered \\"untouchable.\\" Jashuva and his brother were raised by his parents as Christians. In order to fulfill the requirements of higher education, Jashuva obtained the diploma Ubhaya Bhasha Praveena as a scholar of Telugu and Sanskrit languages later in his life. Career Protests against \\"untouchability,\\" Dalit rights, and segregation have been common themes in all of Jashuva's works. Some of the more notable entries into his literary canon include Gabbilam (A Bat), Firadausi (A Rebel) and Kandiseekudu (A Refugee). A number of verses from Jashuva's work have been incorporated into the popular mythological play, Harischandra, most notably during a scene set in the midst of a cremation ground. Dalit communities in Andhra Pradesh consider Jashuva to be the first modern Telugu Dalit poet, and actively protest his erasure from Telugu and Indian literary history. In 1995, Dalit communities in Andhra Pradesh began to organize various centennial celebrations for Jashuva's birth, and have recently begun efforts to revive the remembrance of his literary contributions. Literary works *Gabbilam (1941) is Jashuva's best known work, fashioned after Kālidāsa's Meghadūta (The Cloud Messenger), in which an exiled lover attempts to communicate his affections to his beloved wife. In one stanza, Jashuva writes, \\"To this friendly bat he began telling his life-story with a heart scorched by sorrow. In this senseless and arrogant world, other than lowly birds and insects, do the poor have any intimates or neighbors, any noble swans to explain his warm tears?\\" The man in the poem muses at the irony of his situation, wherein a bat is allowed inside a temple, yet not within a human being, requesting that the bat convey his message to Siva with caution. As the bat travelled to Lord Siva in Kasi, Jashuva utilized the feeling of patriotism, another theme significant to his work, through vivid descriptions of various historical locations throughout India from the perspective of the bat.A blog postReport on Tamil translation of Gabbilam Timeline *Rukmini Kalyanam (1919) *Chidananda Prabhatham and Kushalavopakhyanam (1922) *Kokila (1924) *Dhruva Vijayam, Krishna Nadi and Samsara Saagaram (1925) *Shivaji Prabandham, Veera Bai, Krishna Deva Raayalu, Vemana Yogeendrudu and Bhaarata Maatha (1926) *Bhaarata Veerudu, Suryodayam, Chandrodayam and Gijigaadu (1927) *Ranachyuthi, Aandhrudanu and Thummeda Pendlikoduku (1928) *Sakhi, Buddhudu, Telugu Thalli, Sishuvu and Baashpa Sandesham (1929) *Deergha Nishwasamu, Prabodham, Shilpi, Hechcharika, Saaleedu and Maathru Prema (1930) *Bheeshmudu, Yugandhara Manthri, Sama Dhrushti, Nela Baaludu, Nemali Nelatha, Loka Baandhavudu, Anasuya, Shalya Saaradhyamu and Sandeha Dola (1931) *Swapna Katha, Anaadha, Firdousi, Mumtaj Mahal, Sindhuramu, Budha Mahima, Kreesthu, Gunturu Seema, Vivekananda, Cheetla Peka, Jebunnisa and Paschatthapam (1932) *Ayomayamu, Akhanda Gouthami, Aashwasam, Meghudu and Smashana Vaati (1933) *Aandhra Bhojudu (1934) *Gabbilam (1941) Jashuva Rachanalu: First Volume, Gabbilam, Vishalandhra Publishing House, Hyderabad, 2006. *Kandiseekudu (1945) *Thera Chaatu (1946) *Chinna Naayakudu, Baapuji and Nethaji (1948) *Swayam Varam (1950) *Kottha Lokam (1957) *Christhu Charithra (1958) *Raashtra Pooja and Musafirulu (1963) *Naagarjuna Saagaram and Naa Katha (1966) Awards *Jashuva was presented the Sahitya Akademi Award for his work titled Kreesthu Charitra in 1964.

It was fought on August 17, 1920 near the train station of , a small village located 33 kilometres from the city centre of Lwów (now Lviv). The battle, lasting roughly 24 hours, resulted in the complete destruction of the Polish forces but at the same time halted the Soviet advance, preventing the forces of Siemion Budionnyi from seizing Lwów and so contributing to the successful defence of Warsaw. The battle has been called a Polish Thermopylae. History =Eve of the Battle= By mid-August 1920 the Red Army broke all Polish lines of defense and was marching towards Warsaw. The Polish headquarters prepared a plan to counter-attack the Red Army on its left flank from the Wieprz River area, in what became known as the Battle of Warsaw. To gather enough forces for the offensive, Gen. Józef Piłsudski, Polish Commander in Chief, ordered all available units to move to the Wieprz area and withdrew a number of formations from the Polish Southern Front, leaving only two-and-a-half infantry divisions to oppose the 12th Red Army and Budyonny's cavalry. The city of Lwów was left with merely token forces defending the Upper Bug River line against three Russian armies (9th, 13th and 14th). After several days of heavy fighting, the 1st Cavalry Army under Siemion Budionnyi broke through Polish lines of defense and started its march towards Lwów. The civilian inhabitants of the city started to organize resistance and build field fortifications, anticipating a long siege. Several thousand civilians, mostly students and veterans of the 1918 Battle of Lwów, volunteered for the self-defense units. Ill-equipped detachments were sent towards the front line and fought in several battles (among them battles of Kamionka Strumiłłowa, Ruda Siedlecka, Chodaczków, Krasne, Busko, Biłka Szlachecka, Kurowice, Streptów, Zuchorzyce and Laszki Królewskie), but were unable to stop numerically and technologically superior forces of the Red Army. =Battle= Among the volunteer units organized in Lwów was a group of soldiers of Major (later a general) Roman Abraham. On the morning of August 16, the 1st battalion of the was sent from Lwów towards the village of Nowosiółki (east of the town of ) in order to help the endangered units formed by Roman Abraham. Upon its arrival, the battalion found the town occupied by the Red Army and recaptured it. However, the following day it was endangered by encirclement and was ordered to withdraw towards Lwów. In the morning of August 17 it was taken by surprise near a train station in the village of Zadwórze and was completely destroyed by forces of the Red 6th Cavalry Division of the 1st Cavalry Army. All Polish soldiers, approximately 200, were killed or missing. At the same time, a battalion of approximately 500 volunteers organized by Roman Abraham under command of Captain Bolesław Zajączkowski was marching from Krasne along the Lwów-Tarnopol railroad. On August 17, shortly before noon, when the group reached the village of Kutkorz it was attacked with machine gun fire from the nearby village of Zadwórze. Capt. Zajączkowski ordered his men to form a line and started an assault towards the village. After a short fight, 330 Poles captured the train station. However, the village was not taken and soon the Polish forces were counter-attacked by units of the 6th Cavalry Division. Battle of Zadwórze commemorative medal By dusk, the Poles' ammunition was almost completely depleted, yet the Polish unit managed to repel six consecutive cavalry charges. Captain Zajączkowski decided that further defense of the station was impossible and ordered his units to retreat towards Lwów. However, the retreat was halted by three Bolshevik airplanes strafing the Polish defenders. After suffering heavy casualties, Zajączkowski ordered his men to organize a last pocket of resistance near the lineman's hut. After hand-to-hand combat with sabers and bayonets, the Polish resistance was broken. Out of 330 Polish soldiers who seized the train station earlier that day, 318 were dead. Several dozen wounded Poles were captured by the Red Army and are assumed murdered. Captain Zajączkowski himself committed suicide in order not to be captured by the enemy. Only twelve Polish soldiers returned to the Polish lines to recount what had happened during the battle. =Aftermath= The battle was a disaster for the Polish forces defending Zadwórze, in effect they were almost annihilated. However, the 11-hour-long fight halted the advance of the whole 6th Cavalry Division for almost 24 hours. This allowed for the strengthening of the defences of Lwów. In addition, because of the defense of Zadwórze, the 1st Cavalry Army of Siemion Budionnyi could not reach the forces fighting in the Battle of Warsaw and attack the undefended right flank of the forces of Józef Piłsudski advancing towards the rear of the Red Army forces around Warsaw. When the forces of Budionnyi finally regrouped and restarted their march northwards, it was already too late and the Battle of Warsaw ended with a complete defeat of the Red Army. The 1st Cavalry Army was later defeated in a Battle of Komarów, which became known as \\"the biggest cavalry battle since the 18th century.\\" Remembrance Because of the heroic defense and high casualties, the battle of Zadwórze was nicknamed the \\"Polish Battle of Thermopylae\\". Among the Polish soldiers killed in the battle was 19-year-old , a student of the 7th course of primary school and a veteran of the 1918 defence of Lwów, for which he was awarded with Virtuti Militari and Krzyż Walecznych. His body was never found. He was depicted on a 20-zlytoch coin released by Poland to commemorate the battle. In 1925 when the authorities of Warsaw and the commanders of the Polish Army decided to build a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, his mother Jadwiga Zarugiewiczowa was chosen as the person to select the coffin to be transported to Warsaw and buried in the grave.

The leading 0 must be dialed when calling from within Germany and must be omitted when calling from abroad. When calling via fixed networks within the same area, the area code is not required. In general, shorter area codes are assigned to larger cities, and longer area codes to smaller towns. Private telephone numbers are usually inversely long: those in larger cities have seven or eight digits, while those in smaller towns may have as few as three or four digits. The first digit (after the leading zero) is determined by region: area codes beginning (0)2 are found in the west, those with (0)3 in the east, those with (0)4 in the north, those with (0)5 in the north central part, those with (0)6 in the south central part, those with (0)7 in the southwest, those with (0)8 in the south and the 9s are found in the southeast. (0)1 are special numbers such as mobile phones (015, 016, 017), shared cost service (0180), televoting numbers (013) and 010 for dial-around services. The former codes 0130 for free phone numbers and 0190 for premium-rate numbers are now moved to 0800 and 0900 to meet international standards. 0700 is used for personal national phone numbers. 01

Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak From the evil of that which He created; From the evil of the darkness when it is intense, And from the evil of malignant witchcraft, And from the evil of the envier when he envieth.  Context This surah and the 114th (and last) surah in the Qur'an, an-Nās, are collectively referred to as al-Mu'awwidhatayn \\"the Refuges\\", as both begin with \\"I seek refuge\\", an-Nās tells to seek God for refuge from the evil from within, while al-Falaq tells to seek God for refuge from the evil from outside, so reading both of them would protect a person from his own mischief and the mischief of others. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (asbāb al-nuzūl), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. The word \\"al-Falaq\\" in the first verse, a generic term referring to the process of 'splitting', has been restricted in most translations to one particular type of splitting, namely 'daybreak' or 'dawn'. Verse 4 refers to one of soothsayer techniques to partially tie a knot, utter a curse and spit into the knot and pull it tight. In the pre-Islamic period, soothsayers claimed the power to cause various illnesses. According to soothsayers the knot had to be found and untied before the curse could be lifted. This practice is condemned in verse 4. Hadith The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.Şatibi, El-muvafakat Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur'an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur'an.Muhsin Demirci, Tefsir Usulü, 120 Ḥadīth (حديث) is literally \\"speech\\" or \\"report\\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah. According to Aishah,Grade : Sahih (Al- Albani) صحيح (الألباني) حكم : Reference : Sunan Abi Dawud 1342 In-book reference : Book 5, Hadith 93 English translation : Book 5, Hadith 1337Al-Adab Al-Mufrad » Dealings with people and good character - كتاب English reference : Book 14, Hadith 308 Arabic reference : Book 1, Hadith 308 the life of Prophet Muhammad was practical implementation of Qur'an.Sahih Al- Jami' AI-Saghir, No.4811Sunan Ibn Majah 2333 In-book reference : Book 13, Hadith 26 English translation : Vol. 3, Book 13, Hadith 2333Grade : Sahih (Darussalam) Reference : Sunan an-Nasa'i 1601 In-book reference : Book 20, Hadith 4 English translation : Vol. 2, Book 20, Hadith 1602 Therefore, higher count of hadith elevates the importance of the pertinent surah from a certain perspective. This surah was held in special esteem in hadith, which can be observed by these related narratives. According to hadith, the prophet Muhammad used to recite this surah before sleeping every night. * Abu 'Abdullah narrated that Ibn 'Abis Al-Juhani told him that: The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said to him: \\"O Ibn 'Abis, shall I not tell you of the best thing with which those who seek refuge with Allah may do so?\\" He said: \\"Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\\" He said: \\"Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of the daybreak.\\"(Al-Falaq), \\"Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of mankind.\\"(Al-Nas) - these two Surahs.\\"Sunan an-Nasa'i 5432 In-book reference : Book 50, Hadith 5 English translation : Vol. 6, Book 50, Hadith 5434Sunan Abi Dawud 1462 In-book reference : Book 8, Hadith 47 English translation : Book 8, Hadith 1457Sunan an-Nasa'i 5436 In-book reference : Book 50, Hadith 9 English translation : Vol. 6, Book 50, Hadith 5438 * Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to bed, he would blow upon his hands recite Al-Mu'awwidhat; and pass his hands over his body (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).

It covers Los Angeles music, arts, film, theater, culture, concerts, and events. In 1979 they established the LA Weekly Theater Awards which awards small theatre productions (99 seats or less) in Los Angeles. Starting in 2006, LA Weekly has hosted the LA Weekly Detour Music Festival every October. The entire block surrounding Los Angeles City Hall is closed off to accommodate the festival's three stages. Some of its best known writers were Pulitzer Prize-winning food writer Jonathan Gold, who left in early 2012, and Nikki Finke, who blogged about the film industry through the Weekly website and published a print column in the paper each week, leaving in June 2009 after the blog she founded, Deadline Hollywood Daily, was acquired by an online firm. History The paper was founded in 1978 by Jay Levin, who served as its editor from 1978 to 1991 and its president from 1978 to 1992.

Although some former employees have complained about personnel moves since the Weekly parent company's acquisition by New Times Media in 2004 (which assumed the Village Voice Media name in 2005),\\"...Stewart openly despised the Weekly. And let's be honest: the Weekly staff openly despised her. I don't think that is much of a secret to anyone in L.A. media circles. Putting her in the News Editor chair was like dropping a glowing load of Kryptonite onto the Weekly lunch table.\\" the paper has won a Pulitzer Prize, and broke the story of the \\"Grim Sleeper\\" serial killer. Some of those disgruntled ex-employees complained when New Times replaced news editor Alan Mittelstaedt with New Times LA editor Jill Stewart. But in the 2009 LA Press Club Awards, the Weekly won six first-place awards, including three by staff writer Christine Pelisek, who was honored as the city's best reporter in investigative reporting, hard news, and news feature. Harold Meyerson, once the Weekly political editor, charged in a departing email to Weekly staffers in 2006 that the new owners had grafted a cookie- cutter template for editorial content onto the publication. Writers once closely associated with the Weekly but let go by the paper's current management include Meyerson, classical music critic Alan Rich, theater critic Steven Leigh Morris,\\"After almost 30 years, the Theater Editor position in a city with 2,000 professional plays opening every year was determined by Phoenix to be a fiscal extravagance\\" film critic Ella Taylor, and columnist Marc Cooper. Internal cutbacks have resulted in the paper eliminating the position of managing editor, letting go several staff writers and other editorial department positions, as well as cutting the entire fact checking department. On June 1, 2009, the paper announced that Editor-in-Chief Laurie Ochoa, who began helming the paper in 2001 (before the New Times acquisition), was \\"parting ways\\" with the Weekly. On that same day, ads for her replacement appeared on Craigslist and Journalismjobs.com. Though some speculated that Stewart was a shoo-in for the position, the job quickly went to Drex Heikes, formerly of the Los Angeles Times. When Heikes left in 2011, he was replaced by Sarah Fenske. The management of LA Weekly said staff cuts were necessary owing to poor economic conditions. However, some of the cuts are likely attributable to philosophical differences with the paper's then-owners, who have since sold the chain.During that period, Rick Barrs, editor of the Weekly sister paper Phoenix New Times, left comments on Cooper's blog stating that \\"your old, hippy-dippy paper has gone the way of the dinosaur. extinct. bye, bye.\\" Former staff writer Matthew Fleischer said at the time that \\"as part of the company's 'plug-and-play' management strategy, editors, writers and ad directors were moved from city to city within the chain, without regard for local knowledge. Any old-school Village Voice Media manager who resisted the metamorphosis was denounced as a 'lefty,' a 'throwback,' and worse. They were fired or simply fled.\\" Since 2008, LA Weekly has hosted a food and wine festival, now dubbed The Essentials, that draws sizable crowds. In 2009, former Los Angeles Times food writer Amy Scattergood became food blogger at LA Weeklys Squid Ink, and was later promoted to food editor. In late 2009, the paper hired Dennis Romero, formerly of Ciudad magazine, as a full-time news blogger. Following the recession, in 2012, the paper added food critic Besha Rodell, a James Beard Foundation Award nominee and former food editor of Atlanta's Creative Loafing. Then in 2013, LA Weekly named Amy Nicholson as its lead film critic. In 2016, LA Weekly named multimedia journalist and Emmy- winning producer Drew Tewksbury as managing editor. =2012 sale= In September 2012, Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan and Jeff Mars bought Village Voice Media's papers and associated web properties from its founders and formed Voice Media Group. The paper won journalism awards before and after this transition, with two of its news writers, Patrick Range McDonald and Gene Maddaus, winning the Los Angeles Press Club's nod for \\"Journalist of the Year\\". For a time in the Los Angeles market, LA Weekly competed against two now-defunct publications, including Brand X (a weekly published by the Los Angeles Times and produced by a crew that included former LA Weekly staffers) and LA CityBeat, a smaller alternative weekly newspaper owned by Southland Publishing, which ceased publication in March 2009. Southland also owns the Pasadena Weekly, (helmed by veteran LA-area newsman Kevin Uhrich), The Argonaut on the Westside of Los Angeles, and other print products in Southern California. =2017 sale= In November 2017, the publication was sold to Semanal Media LLC.

He is the Fifth Child and the seventeenth angel, Tabris. He is sent to Nerv by Seele as a replacement pilot for Unit 02 after Asuka Langley Soryu's synchronization ratio falls below usability. He later breaks into Terminal Dogma to return to Adam, but after he discovers the being there is actually Lilith, he permits Shinji Ikari to destroy him. He appears in The End of Evangelion during Third Impact, communicating with Shinji as Adam together with Rei as Lilith in regard to the choice of whether to accept or reject Instrumentality. Despite his very small screentime in the series (first appearing two episodes only before the series' finale, and only mentioned in the following episode), Kaworu became a popular and recognizable character, partially due to his sex appeal. A Newtype poll in 2010 ranked him the second most popular male anime character from the 1990s. Conception Though appearing only in one of the final episodes of Evangelion, Hideaki Anno made character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto draw him in the opening video of the series for a brief frame although Anno believed there were minor changes until his actual appearance. Anno's idea with Kaworu was to make him as an idealized version of Shinji Ikari. In the initial stages, Kaworu was a child who carried around a cat. The very first plot title was “The cat and the transfer student.” It was a story about transfer student carrying a cat coming to the school and so forth. As the staff went on with it, in episode 24, it had already moved away from the school. As a result, Anno believes Kaworu would have made minor appearances before his actual debut, but eventually cut down his role to one episode. Akira Ishida's performance as Kaworu's voice actor gave Anno a good impression, and Anno denied \\"carnal feelings\\" on Shinji's part. Anno also considered expanding on his role in the Director's Cuts of Episode 24, but decided to prioritize clarifying Kaworu's connection to Seele. In early designs, Kaworu was depicted as a school boy with a pet cat who could switch to an \\"Angel form\\".NEWTYPE 100% COLLECTION: NEON GENESIS EVANGELION. 1997 Kadokawashoten. . Partial translation . In the ninth volume of the manga, one of Sadamoto's artworks is a portrayal of Kaworu dressed in black and holding a black cat. In the making of the manga, Sadamoto stated he had no clear understanding of Kaworu's real personality due to how he is presented as an antagonist, and characterized their relationship as written to be similar to a primary school student seeking admiration towards an older, middle school student. Kaworu was named by screenplay writer Akio Satsukawa. Kaworu's surname \\"Nagisa\\" comes from the Japanese word , meaning \\"waterside\\" or \\"shore\\", concerned with sea. It also comes from Japanese movie director Nagisa Oshima. Adding to these, the character \\"\\", when divided, can be read . The title of episode 24 is . \\"\\" includes two Japanese words read as \\"shisha\\" (the character \\"\\" only represents the sound \\"shi\\"). The first is , while the other is . Gainax renders his name in Romaji as \\"Kaworu\\", according to the Japanese spelling using the archaic wo kana (ヲ), not \\"Kaoru\\" as would be given by most romanization schemes even for this spelling. The reasons for the difference in the naming have not been explicitly detailed by the series' creators; one theory is that the name is based on the original kana of the name Kaoru Genji, from The Tale of Genji. Appearances =Neon Genesis Evangelion= Kaworu appears in the twenty-fourth episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion as a replacement pilot for Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu, who are both unable to pilot their Evangelions. He meets remaining Evangelion pilot Shinji Ikari in the ruins of the battle with the preceding Angel, and talks to him about human cultural achievements, such as music. Kaworu and Shinji, who now feels he is devoid of any connections, quickly strike up a friendship; they share a public bath, and Shinji sleeps over at Kaworu's apartment, hesitant to go to his own home, as he is afraid of facing Misato and unaware that Asuka is no longer missing. Kaworu comments on the fragility of humans. The nature of Kaworu and Shinji's relationship is depicted in an ambiguous manner, as Kaworu uses the phrase to describe his feelings for Shinji; the phrase can be used to denote anything from intimacy or friendship to love.Episode 24, \\"The Beginning and the End, or \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\"\\" Misato Katsuragi is suspicious of the suddenness of Kaworu's arrival, his lack of background files, and his immediate high synchronization rates with Asuka's Unit 02, and later observes him meeting with SEELE. In the climax of the episode, NERV is alerted that Unit 02 has activated without a pilot and that Kaworu, who is identified as the Seventeenth and final Angel, is descending to Terminal Dogma to meet Adam. Shinji takes pursuit in Unit 01, but is hindered by Kaworu's AT Field and Unit 02. When Kaworu reaches Terminal Dogma, he realizes the imprisoned Angel is actually Lilith, and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji reluctantly acquiesces, and crushes him with Unit 01's hand. Later, Shinji laments, but Misato tells him he did the right thing. =The End of Evangelion= Kaworu appears during the initiation of the Human Instrumentality Project, sharing a body alongside Rei in a giant apparition of Lilith. Rei's disfigured appearance within Lilith terrifies the already traumatised Shinji, but Kaworu calms Shinji down. He is asked by Yui what he wishes for as Lilith returns to Rei's form and Shinji sees a woman's clutched breasts as he enters Instrumentality. Kaworu also appears to Shinji's father Gendo during Instrumentality alongside Rei and Gendo's wife Yui, as they accuse Gendo of running away through his emotional detachment from Shinji. As Instrumentality draws to a close, Kaworu and Rei ask Shinji about the future of humanity and whether Shinji wants to accept the process; Shinji rejects Instrumentality, saying that Rei and Kaworu are just \\"pretenses\\", but at least in reality, he would know his feelings were real. =Rebuild of Evangelion= Promotional materials for Rebuild of Evangelion showed prominent images of Kaworu in his plugsuit with the other Children.Anime News Service, 9-6-06 (6:46PM EDT)---- Confirmed: \\"Evangelion Shin Gekijou Ban\\" Details In the first film, he briefly appears at the ending, in which he has a mysterious conversation with SEELE on the surface of the Moon. In the second film, Gendo and Fuyutsuki travel to the Moon to observe the construction of the Mark.06; much to Fuyutsuki's surprise, they see Kaworu sitting naked on top of the Eva in hard vacuum. He turns towards them and calls someone a father. In the end, Kaworu comes down from the Moon with the Mark.06 and impales Unit 01, aborting Third Impact as Kaji states that \\"Seele won't stand for this\\". Afterwards he says that the promised time has come and that this time he will bring Shinji happiness. The preview of the third film shows Kaworu confronting four other pilots in an unknown location. In the third film, fourteen years after the second film, he appears to now be working for NERV. When Shinji arrives at NERV, Gendo tells him that he and Kaworu will be piloting Eva Unit-13. During Shinji's stay at NERV, he forms a friendship with Kaworu, who teaches him how to play the piano, and stargazes with him. Later when Shinji asked what had happened to the people he knew, Kaworu takes him to the ruins of Geofront and Tokyo-3, explaining that Shinji's awakening of Unit-01 was the \\"catalyst\\" of Third Impact and further decimated the world. He also reveals the aim of the ongoing Human Instrumentality Project: to kill all life on Earth, allowing for the creation of beings that bear the Fruit of Life. When Fuyutsuki reveals about Yui Ayanami being inside Unit-01 and the Rei clones, Shinji has a mental breakdown. On the day of the operation, Shinji is unsure whether to follow Gendo's orders or Misato's plea to not pilot an Evangelion again, so Kaworu takes the choker off Shinji, which he claims was originally made for him, and wears it as a sign of trust. Later, Shinji and Kaworu pilot Unit-13 into Terminal Dogma as Kaworu claims they can use the Spears of Cassius and Longinus to undo Third Impact; Rei follows in Mark.09. When Unit-13 reaches Lilith's corpse, Kaworu realizes that both spears are similar and after a period unresponsive in deep thought as Mari and Asuka, who asks him if he trying to start another Impact, assault them and Kaworu pleads with Shinji to not remove them. Despite Kaworu's and Asuka's pleas Shinji removes the spears, causing Lilith to explode into LCL. Mark.09 decapitates Mark.06 to release the Twelfth Angel, which is absorbed by Unit-13. The awakened Unit-13 flies out of the Geofront and rises into the sky, starting Fourth Impact. Kaworu reveals he is the First Angel, now \\"cast down\\" to the Thirteenth. The choker detects Unit-13's awakening and activates. To halt Fourth Impact, Kaworu allows the choker to kill him before Shinji's eyes, although this is only accomplished later by Mari ejecting Shinji manually from Unit-13. Before dying, he states that he and Shinji will meet again. =In other media= Kaworu makes appearances in various other media spin-offs of Neon Genesis Evangelion, including various audio dramas and music CDs and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's adaptation of the anime. Here, Kaworu is portrayed as being ignorant of human emotions and taboos regarding social interaction and personal space, creating some comic relief. His role is very similar to his anime counterpart's although some details have been altered, such as his friendship with Shinji not being immediate or even non-existent, and Kaworu himself being often used in a comic relief manner. Aside from Sadamoto's manga, Kaworu also appears as a supporting character in other titles, such as Shinji Ikari Raising Project. In these manga appearances, Kaworu is typically portrayed in a lighter tone than in the series, with focus placed on his relationship with Shinji, usually competing for his attentions with Asuka and Rei. He is primarily used as comic relief in Raising Project but is only present in the very early chapters of the story and is absent thereafter. Kaworu also appears in video games based on the Evangelion franchise, including the popular cross-over franchise Super Robot Wars. In the game's adaption of The End of Evangelion, Kaworu's spirit returns to take control of Unit-00 and aid Shinji in battle and help rescue Rei from inside Lilith. He also visits Nekki Basara and voices his approval of his music. He makes his final appearance during the final battle with Kaiser Ephes where he encourages the Eva pilots not give up. Reception Kaworu Nagisa was the second most popular male character in the 1997 Animage poll; in 1998 he was ranked 6th.Animage, June 1998 In a Newtype poll from March 2010, Kaworu was voted as the second most popular male anime character from the 1990s, after Shinji Ikari. As a promotion for its 10th Anniversary Special Edition of Evangelion, ADV Films published a humorous bumper sticker which reads .EVA 10th Limited Edition Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge described Kaworu's death in the anime as an \\"extremely powerful moment\\" due to the fact that after a minute without dialogue, his head's shadow appears touching the water. The bonus materials in volume nine of the English adaptation of the manga include an article written by editor Carl Gustav Horn comparing Kaworu to the character Satan in Mark Twain's novella The Mysterious Stranger. Critics liked Kaworu's role in the Rebuild of Evangelion films. Kotaku considered Kaworu's scenes with Shinji as the best parts from Evangelion 3.0 as through their interactions Anno is able to give a message to the viewers in regards to how much the plot of the Rebuild films has changed and comment how people have to accept change. Japanator enjoyed how much more screen-time Kaworu gets in the film in comparison to the original television series as, sharing similar comments with Kotaku based on how his character represents hope for Shinji to redo things. Anime News Network praised Kaworu's kindness in the film as the highlight of the storyline comparing this incarnation to the original Asuka who befriended Shinji as in both relationships, the pairs have to befriend each other as well as act coordinately, however noted that \\"his influence is meant to show us that Shinji is still a long, long way from self-acceptance\\" as he instead tries to find validation in Kaworu. THEM Anime Reviews found Kaworu's personality and relationship with Shinji in 3.0 effective if it came as rushed, and how \\"Shinji is at his weakest and most fearful\\" in it. Los Angeles Times considered Kaworu's introduction while playing a piano as important for the film due to how it represents the ideas that sins can be atoned for. In the 2019 dub of the series by Netflix, one of Kaworu's lines to Shinji was changed from ADV DVD's \\"I love you\\" to \\"I like you\\", also present in the VHS subtitles. This generated controversy with some fans of the series who felt it altered their relationship and contributed to queer erasure. In an interview, Dan Kanemitsu, Khara's in-house translator, responsible for the updated Evangelion subtitles and other official Gainax and Khara translations including the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, said it was not meant to contrast ADV's dub. Instead, Kanemitsu, who claims he consults the original creator when meaning is unclear or ambiguous, defended the importance of ambiguity, citing Anno's commentary about human relationships and the general ambiguity and open-endedness surrounding Evangelion as a whole, something repeatedly defended by Anno, who has invited multiple interpretations of Evangelion while also generally denying explanations of his own, and defended his commitment to accuracy. It is not publicly available whether Khara has more closely supervised the new translation than the older ADV ones; however the director for the new English dub stated \\"Japan made all the casting decisions\\" through blind auditions, which was not the case with the previous ones. =Relationship with Shinji= Like many other characters, Kaworu's interactions with Shinji have been a topic of debate among fans of Evangelion since the series' first run. Although Kaworu had a brief appearance for one episode in the original anime, he had a very prominent role in the Rebuild movie, Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, in which he had a more developed relationship with Shinji. Kaworu's sexuality is ambiguous. Some videogames allow him to be a possible romantic option for Shinji as well as multiple female characters as in Shinji Ikari Raising Project though he sometimes has less scenes or no ending route like in Girlfriend of Steel 2. Spinoffs such as Angelic Days put him in a more comedic or romantic light though he still tends to have less space than other side characters, particularly Asuka or Rei, who receive the same treatment. Evangelion ANIMA also features a \\"Dark Kaworu\\" who hates humans and hates music. Patrick Drazen's book Anime Explosion! The What? Why? & Wow! Of Japanese Animation expresses the view that Kaworu's offer of apparent love for Shinji is a tactic that Kaworu as the last Angel used to disarm Shinji.Drazen, Patrick (October 2002). '\\"A Very Pure Thing\\": Gay and Pseudo-Gay Themes' in Anime Explosion! The What, Why & Wow of Japanese Animation Berkeley, California: Stone Bridge Press p.95 . In 1998 reviewer Kenneth Lee criticized Kaworu, saying: \\"...the element of homosexuality is perhaps the most disturbing, gratuitous, and unnecessary aspect that presents itself in episode 24...Ultimately, the homosexuality issue seems nothing more than cheap shock value tactics to stun generation X\\"; he considered the entire Shinji-Kaworu relationship \\"ludicrous and pathetically humorous\\".\\"The fact that within a span of 14 minutes we are expected to believe that Shinji and Kaworu have transcended all boundaries and inhibitions to achieve an unearthly 'Love' and openness for each other is completely ludicrous and pathetically humorous...Yet, along comes Kaworu, who he's known for about 10 minutes and is a boy, no less, and Shinji seems completely accepting of Kaworu's open touches and fondles.\\" \\"The Thin Veneer Known as \\"Evangelion\\"\\", ANN Staff also indicates to not have been expecting Kaworu to provoke such a strong impression of that in the first place and attribute their lack of attention to this to the lack of time when making the later episodes. Regardless, Gainax is clearly aware that the audience associates Kaworu with bishōnen tropes, and have produced artworks such as splash pages for their website in reference to Kaworu's ambiguity and the audience's reaction to the character.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UTK5N8K/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687622&pf;_rd_s=lpo- top- stripe-1&pf;_rd_t=201&pf;_rd_i=B000J9Y6JS&pf;_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_r=12594XRGZZ1QQT8XD645 This is not unique to Kaworu, however, as merchandising constantly pairs Asuka and Rei in a similar fashion, much like Shinji is often paired with Asuka or Rei, or Kaworu himself with Rei.https://www.amazon.com/Vertex-Evangelion- Kaworu-Nagisa-Non- Scale/dp/B00M9Z404G/ref=pd_sim_sbs_21_5?ie=UTF8&dpID;=41VbbXgh0HL&dpSrc;=sims&preST;=_AC_UL160_SR108%2C160_&refRID;=05SVF5RCC5HT80WD98CC However, some believe that whether Kaworu, an Angel, actually has any concept of sexuality as he is presented in the series is unclear. Mike Crandol regards Kaworu as being \\"representative of blind, total and unconditional love and acceptance, but like those things Kaworu turns out to not be real at all\\".http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2002-06-11 Notes References Category:Television characters introduced in 1996 Category:Fictional angels Category:Fictional clones Category:Fictional
