Characteristics They locomotives were superheated and had plate frames, Belpaire fireboxes, piston valves and Walschaerts valve gear. As built, their coal bunkers had a capacity. At some stage, the coal bunker of no. 2220 was enlarged to a capacity. Service The locomotives were placed in service on the North Coast and the Pietermaritzburg to Franklin lines in Natal. From 1926, some were allocated to Paardeneiland to work on the line from Cape Town across Sir Lowry's Pass to Caledon in the Overberg.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Fort Bend County, Texas in 2001, and became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1962. John and Lottie house The home was built by John M. Moore (1862–1940) and his wife Lottie Dyer Moore (1865–1924) in 1883, the year they married. John Moore became Secretary of State of Texas in 1886, later serving in both the Texas House of Representatives and the United States House of Representatives. Lottie's father J. Foster Dyer, who died a year before the wedding, was a wealthy rancher in Fort Bend County. Her maternal grandmother Nancy Gray Spencer Barnett was among the original colonists who came to Texas with Stephen F. Austin. In 1824, Austin granted Barnett land in Fort Bend County. Lottie inherited acreage from the original grant her grandmother received. From her grandfather Thomas Barnett, Lottie inherited the cattle on the ranch. The house was designed in 1883 by Thomas Culshaw, as a four-bedroom, two-story Victorian mansion with a center tower and cupola. The First Baptist Church of Richmond was founded in the Moore house, which served as its original meeting location. In 1889, the church moved to its own building. C.H. Page and Brothers of Austin designed the 1905 Classical Revival remodel of the house and connecting property. It was during this remodel that the heating system of the house was converted to seven coal-burning fireplaces. The front facade was remodeled in the Classic Revival porch and columns which now exist on the house. Interior improvements included new hardwood flooring, room expansions, front entry stairway, and a dining room remodel. The grape arbor and gazebo were constructed during this period. Present day Lottie Moore died in 1924, and John M. Moore died in 1940. The house was passed down through successive heirs until 1975, when the last family member died. The house and property was then deeded over to the Fort Bend History Association (formerly the Fort Bend County Museum Association) and is currently a part of the Fort Bend Museum complex. The association has upgraded the home to bring it up to code in accordance with state and local requirements.

Born in Hedmark county to a biblical family, he became noted for his national orientated writings on art history, which spanned from the antiquity to his contemporary society. He became best known for his work Slegten fra 1814, which became a primer in Norwegian historiography. Biography He was born in Brandval, Hedmark, the son of vicar Hans Peter Schnitler (1836–1894) and Marine Sophie Petrea Wille (1848–1919).

Upon finishing his examen artium in 1896, he enrolled at the Royal Frederic University where he took a philological degree in 1904. Initially not interested in art history, he came under the influence of professor Lorentz Dietrichson, who taught him the subject. In the years 1906–11, he worked as an art critic for the newspaper Aftenposten and taught history of art at schools in Christiania. Upon Dietrichson's death in 1918, he entered the position as lecturer at the Royal Frederic University. Three years later, he was appointed professor.Godal, Anne Marit, ed. \\"Carl Wille Schnitler.\\" Store norske leksikon. Web. 19 September 2011. Prior to his appointment as professor of the Royal Frederic University, he made study trips in Europe and Egypt. Whilst in Italy, he studied Baroque visual art and architecture. In July 1926 he married Elisabeth Konow Bruenech (1898–1994) and died three months later.Guleng, Mai Britt. \\"Carl Wille Schnitler.\\" Norsk biografisk leksikon. Ed. Knut Helle. Vol. 8.

Work In his first published work, Vore oldeforældres land (1910), he maintained that Norwegian artists of the 18th and 19th century had reacquired a feeling of nature that was lost in the Renessance. His best-known work Slegten fra 1814. Studier over norsk embedsmandskultur i klassicismens tidsalder 1814–1840. Kulturformene (1911) constituted an attempt to depict the culture of early 19th-century politicians and civil servants. Schnitler had, according to the literary scholar Ottar Grepstad, timed the release of that work, so that it could be read before the centennial anniversary of the 1814 constitution.Grepstad, Ottar. Det litterære skattkammer: Sakprosaens teori og retorikk. Oslo: Det Norske Samlaget, 1997, p. 415. . Print. In his 1914 published book Fredriksværn. Et norsk militæranlæg fra rokokotiden (1914) he maintained that the architecture of the naval base Fredriksvern was governed by Baroque ideals. He eventually released the work Norske haver i gammel og ny tid (1916) in two volumes, chapters of which were translated into Swedish. That work, which describes many centuried gardens, outlines the main traits of Norwegian and European gardening, and has become a standard reference work within the study of Norwegian horticulture.Langeland, Knut. Oldemors stauder i våre hager. Oslo: Schibsted, 1992, p. 22. . Print. His Italy studies resulted in the books Italiensk renæssance og barok i havekunst og bykunst (1917) and Reise i Grækenland. Glimt av Italien (1922). In 1920, he published the book Norges kunstneriske opdagelse. Maleren Erik Pauelsens norske landskaper 1788 in which he argued that the landscapes of Erik Pauelsen revealed an artist with a developed \\"feeling of art\\". In the same year he published Malerkunsten i Norge i det attende aarhundre, which was a systemic treatment of 18th- century paintings in Norway. In addition to his many published works, Schnitler penned numerous articles in art journals and newspapers. He also wrote a few entries on Norwegian artists in the encyclopaedias Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Künstler and Norsk biografisk leksikon.

He is sometimes credited with co-founding the vegan movement in 1944 (with Dorothy and Donald Watson and other friends) without using the term \\"vegan\\". Life Semple relaxing at the door of his \\"Wheelhouse\\", at Linwood Moss, in 1907, during the period he was working as a draughtsman. Semple's mother hailed from a farm near Beith, and his father worked as a tailor. He was born in Johnstone near Paisley, Scotland. Dugald won a bursary to Paisley Grammar School and served an apprenticeship as an engineering draughtsman. In 1907, he moved into a tent, and later an old omnibus located on Linwood Moss. In 1916, he was a conscientious objector and thus exempted from military service on condition that he continued lecturing on food economy. Davie's o'the Mill ruins in 2011. Dugald Semple, vegan and \\"Scottish Apostle of the simple life,\\" farmed at Davie's o'the Mill near Beith in North Ayrshire from the 1930s until around 1950, when it was a smallholding. Dugald was a hippy before hippies officially existed and started living in an army tent from 1907. He was sometimes known as the 'Hut Man' from living in his 'hut on wheels' or caravan and therefore probably did not live in the house. He later lived in Fairlie, North Ayrshire.The Scotsman Retrieved : 19 September 2011 Semple preached self-responsibility and care for others. Curiously for a vegetarian he appears in a photograph of Davie's o'the Mill to be keeping chickens. He regularly appeared on radio programmes, including Out with Romany and Hutman of the BBC. He lived with his wife Cathie in London for two years when he was the secretary of the Vegetarian Society. A regular visitor to Ailsa Craig, he was known locally as the 'Bird Man' and was an enthusiast for outdoor living, publishing a book entitled A Free Man's Philosophy. He welcomed walkers and cyclists who often camped on his land. In 1963, Dugald detailed his dietary journey: > I began rather drastically over 50 years ago [~1910] by cutting out not only > all meat or flesh foods, but milk, eggs, butter, tea and coffee. Cheese I > have never eaten; indeed I hate the very smell of this decayed milk. Next, I > adopted a diet of nuts, fruit, cereals and vegetables. On this Edenic fare I > lived for some ten years, and found that my health and strength were greatly > improved. […] While I was in London (during World War I), I found it > necessary to add some dairy products to my meals, but on returning to > Scotland I gradually eliminated these again. In later life, he lived in a modern cottage and even owned a car. Death Dugald Semple died in a nursing home in Fairlie, aged 79; the cause of his death was not disclosed. Cathie Amos, his wife, predeceased him, dying of heart failure in 1941. They had no children, although Cathie had a son, Ian, who was killed in World War I. Fruitarianism The Fruitarian Society was plagued with disputes over the definition of Fruitarianism from as early as 1907. The Scottish Vegetarian Society featured an article in their 1907 journal entitled \\"Fruitarianism\\" by Dugald Semple, in which he wrote: Dugald Semple's autograph > By fruitarianism is meant a dietary consisting chiefly of nuts and fruits. > Cooked cereals and vegetables are not necessarily excluded, although the > exclusion of all cooked foods, should means and knowledge permit, will lead > to better results. For this dietary it will be noticed that not only is > flesh and meat omitted, but also the animal products milk and eggs. The use > of these products by vegetarians has long been one of the chief objections > to vegetarianism, especially in medical circles. Dugald stated, to make the point about \\"Lacto-Vegetarianism\\" stated that he had \\"never tasted cheese, and therefore it could not be considered as an essential 'binding agent' for body and soul!\\" In 1912, Dugald stated that he did not believe that milk and eggs were natural foods for man: \\"Eggs were meant to produce chickens and not omelettes; and cow's milk is a perfect food for a calf, but most assuredly not for a grown-up human being.\\" In his 1915 book, Joys of the Simple Life, he wrote an essay entitled \\"Alone with Nature\\", stating that \\"I left off eating flesh-meat and drinking tea ten years ago, and for over eight years have rarely used milk, eggs, salt, sugar, dairy butter, white bread, or condiments of any kind. My health has improved considerably and I have never regretted the change.\\" Influence ;Committee positions In 1938 Dugald was the President of the Scottish Vegetarian Society (SVS) and Vice-President of the Vegetarian Society. In 1944, Dugald is recorded as the chairman of the Vegan Society and vice-president of the International Vegetarian Union.Vegetarian Society History Retrieved : 19 September 2011 In 1953 he was Honorary President of the Scottish Vegetarian Society. In 1954, Dugald was still president of the SVS, one of several Vice-Presidents of IVU. ;Lecture Tours The Victoria Advocate newspaper of Texas reported that he lectured on his beliefs and way of life in the USA, Canada, and America. From the August 1910 issue of the Vegetarian Messenger: \\"Mr. Dugald Semple, the Scottish apostle of the Simple Life, is arranging lecturing tours for the coming winter. He is prepared to give lectures for a modest fee, and we are sure that his services would be appreciated by vegetarian and allied societies. His address is Wheelhouse, Bridge of Weir, Scotland.\\"Scottish Vegetarian Society Retrieved : 19 September 2011 The address appears to refer to his horse drawn caravan that can be seen in the photograph of Davie's o'the Mill. ; Conferences Title page of The Sunfood Way to Health Dugald was a delegate from Great Britain to the 1938 10th World Vegetarian Congress held in Norway, attending as President of the Scottish Vegetarian Society and Vice- President of The Vegetarian Society. He delivered a speech on \\"Vegetarianism and Peace\\", in which he stated: > Vegetarianism is not merely a matter of food reform – it is a philosophy of > life, and war will only cease when we cease to live as beasts of prey. So > long as we prepare for war we shall get war. We must not only study Darwin > but also Kropotkin. Those animals which are carnivorous are becoming less > and the vegetarian animals are increasing. Vegetarianism is the first great > step. The killing of human beings is akin to the killing of animals and so > the exploiting of animal life leads to the selfish exploitation of human > beings. Dugald quoted Robert Burns, appealing for a more widespread appreciation of the real values in life – more sunshine for the body, more love for the soul, peace for every living creature the world over. In 1953, at the 15th World Vegetarian Congress held in India, Dugald stated: \\"What a tragedy it would be if Mother India was to become estranged from her sympathy with the rights of animals, which although it may have been carried to extremes, nevertheless has been a noble example to the flesh-eating and vivisecting nations of the West.\\" Yes, let us do our utmost to save India from the soulless materialism of imperialistic nations. Let us show that war and disease are the result of disobedience to spiritual and natural law. That if we harden our hearts against the everyday cruelty off flesh-eating and blood sports, we cannot wonder that the whole; so-called civilised world is preparing for another world catastrophe. East and West must meet if we are to hasten the coming of the New JerusaIem. We go forth to show that science is an affair of the heart as well as the head. That the poor Indian need not live on such a meagre diet, and that we must realise that without love the people perish. The basic error, as Maitra, editor of the Indian journal, once told me, \\"You people live beside yourself, we live from ourselves. It is only more life in the soul that can unite all people.\\" In 1955, at the World Vegetarian Congress in Paris, Dugald Semple was listed as a speaker. ;Individuals Morris Krok, born in Johannesburg, South Africa and whilst seeking solutions for his health problems was influenced by natural healing writers of the 20th century such as Dugald Semple, Vincent Priessnitz, Louis Kuhne, etc. ;Government Civilian rationing began at the end of World War I, on 1 January 1918, with sugar, then meat, butter, and margarine. The Government of the day consulted Dugald and a colleague to educate people concerning how to ration available produce and other food and to propose acceptable substitutes for meat, which had become familiar in their diets. ;No Stipend League Dugald organised a Scottish 'No Stipend League' against the Church of Scotland's practice of levying a tithe on landowners for the minister's stipend. He was particularly offended because the levy applied to landowners regardless of their faith. Published works * Simple Life Visitors.

Giselle Diwag Esteban (born February 4, 1984) of Union City, California, a former friend of Le, was arrested on September 7 and charged with her murder, although a body had not yet been found at that time. Authorities said there was enough DNA evidence in the form of blood stains found in Le's car and on Esteban's shoe, and that security video footage confirmed Esteban's presence in the area at the time Le disappeared. Esteban allegedly blamed Le for ruining her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, with whom she had a child, but denied any involvement in Le's disappearance. Esteban was indicted on a murder charge December 14, 2011.Kurhi, Eric, \\"Grand jury transcripts show slain Michelle Le was subject of suspect's growing hatred\\", Hayward Daily Review, published by San Diego Mercury News, December 31, 2011.

This imposing 2-1/2 story Italianate house was built c. 1882 as a speculative venture, probably intended for use as a hotel, based on the projected route of the New Brunswick Railway. It is one of Houlton's most impressive 19th-century houses, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 1986. Description and history The Amazeen House is located in a residential area near Houlton's central business district, surrounded by early 20th-century houses. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a steeply-pitched gable roof. The main facade, facing north, is three bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by two-story polygonal window bays. The wall of this facade is flushboarded, while other facades are finished in clapboards and novelty siding. The front is covered by a three-story porch, with square posts and balustrade. A second porch, just one story in height covers part of the rear and features Italianate brackets; part of this porch has been enclosed. A large 2-1/2 story carriage barn is connected to the rear of the house. The house was built c. 1882 as a speculative venture by Stephen D. Amazeen, in the anticipation that the New Brunswick Railway might extend service in the direction of its location, and locate a station and junction there. This extension was never built, and the building has always seen residential use, first as a home for the Amazeens, and later as multi-unit housing.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Spokane. History Our Lady of Lourdes Parish can trace its beginnings to the first Mass celebrated in Spokane. The Rev. Joseph Cataldo, SJ celebrated the Mass in August 1881 in a converted carpenter's shop that he named St. Joseph. Five years later a brick church was constructed and named Our Lady of Lourdes. The Sisters of the Holy Names opened a parish school. The cornerstone for the present church building was laid in 1903. A new school building was completed three years later. On December 17, 1913, St. Pius X established the Diocese of Spokane and Our Lady of Lourdes was named the diocesan cathedral. Architecture Interior of the cathedral The cathedral is designed in an Italian Romanesque Revival style. The exterior of the structure is faced with red brick accented with granite. The facade is framed by two square towers that reach a height of . The interior was most recently renovated in 2019 when the sanctuary was covered in marble and a new marble altar and pews were installed. The new marble altar was a gift of Tim and Sherry Murphy in memory of their families. The old high altar, topped by a Calvary scene, remains in the apse. It was a gift of the Patsy Clarke family of Spokane. The bishop's cathedra (chair) is a combination of the original 1913 throne of Bishop Schinner, the marble cathedra from the 1930s and a new addition in 2018. The bishop's cathedra is a gift from the Dennis and Stacy Harrington family in memory of Deacon John Sicilia. The restored marble pulpit was made possible through the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Redmond. The cathedral has one organ in the loft W. W. Kimball pipe organ. The stunning stained glass windows are from Bavaria.

Cleveland House is an historic house at 87 Court Street in Houlton, Maine. A distinctive local example of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival architecture, it was built in 1902 by Edward L. Cleveland, one of Aroostook County's largest dealers in potatoes, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in June 1987. Description and history The Cleveland House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, set on a brick foundation on a large grassy lot at the corner of Court and Columbia Streets. It has the asymmetrical massing typical of Queen Anne Victorians, with a conical turret at the southeast corner, and a porch that wraps around the east and north sides. Stylistically the porch is more Colonial Revival in character, with grouped Ionic columns supporting a roof that extends to a gable end at the north. The main (east-facing) facade is three bays wide, with the turret occupying the left bay, and the entrance at the center, with a projecting enclosed porch above that has a segmented-arch roof line and a pair of round- arch windows. The interior of the house features high quality period woodwork. Edward L. Cleveland was born in Camden, Maine, and first operated a merchant business based in Boston, Massachusetts. C. 1878 he moved to Houlton, where he established a potato shipping firm that rapidly became one of the largest in Aroostook County, whose economy was then dominated by that crop. By 1908 Cleveland had warehouse capacity for 500,000 bushels, and was shipping potatoes throughout the eastern United States. He was also politically active, serving in the state legislature. In 1902 the center of Houlton was devastated by a large fire, which consumed not only much of its business district but some of the surrounding residential areas as well. Cleveland's house was among those lost in the fire, and he soon afterward acquired the land to build the present house. The architect is not known. It remained his home until his death in 1939. It was sold out of the family by his daughter in 1960.

Built in 1880, it is the most architecturally sophisticated Second Empire building in northern Maine. It was built for Walter P. Mansur, a prominent local businessman and banker. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 1990. Description and history The Mansur House is set on the west side of Water Street, just north of Houlton's central business district, Market Square. It is a rambling 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a rectangular main block and a 1-1/2 story rear ell that joins it to a carriage house. The main facade is three bays wide, with the left bay projecting forward and the right bays sheltered by a single-story porch supported by turned columns. The left bay corners are quoined on the first floor (as is the corner at the far right of the facade), with two stories of polygonal bay windows rising to the mansard roof. The first floor bay window has a bracketed cornice, a more elaborate version of cornices that top windows on the first floor left facade. The entire roof line is studded with double brackets. The projecting section is topped by a pyramidal roof formation above the mansard. The entire main block is finished in flushboarding. The house was built in 1880 for Walter P. Mansur, who was in 1881 named president of the First National Bank of Houlton, and also served as president of the local water company. Mansur lived here until his death in 1900, and his widow sold the property in 1911 to the Roman Catholic parish of St. Mary's. At the time of the property's listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was used by the parish as a school and convent. As of 2015, it is occupied by the Bowers Funeral Home.

Waxcap grasslands occur principally in Europe, where they are declining as a result of agricultural practices. The fungal species are consequently of conservation concern and efforts have been made in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to protect both the grasslands and their characteristic fungi. Background The association of waxcaps with unimproved (nutrient-poor) grasslands was first noted in 1949 in the Netherlands, but current interest was stimulated by a series of papers published by Dutch mycologist Eef Arnolds in the 1980s. Arnolds not only confirmed the association of waxcaps with unimproved grasslands, but also noted the rapid decline in such habitats in the Netherlands. Similar studies were subsequently undertaken elsewhere in Europe, initially in Denmark and the United Kingdom. Definition and description Waxcap grasslands are characterized by being unimproved (unfertilized and nutrient-poor), short-sward (through grazing or mowing), moss-rich, and long-established (not recently sown). They occur in both upland and lowland areas and may be on acidic, neutral, or calcareous soil. They support a wide range of characteristic larger fungi, but may not be equally species-rich in plants. Characteristic species Larger fungi characteristic of waxcap grasslands include agarics belonging to the genera Hygrocybe (waxcaps), Entoloma (pinkgills), Dermoloma, Porpoloma, and Camarophyllopsis, clavarioid fungi (club and coral fungi) belonging to the genera Clavaria, Clavulinopsis, and Ramariopsis, and earthtongues belonging to the genera Geoglossum, Microglossum, and Trichoglossum. File:H psittacina2 Rosemary Winnall cropped.jpgHygrocybe psittacina File:2009-06-30 Entoloma mougeotii.jpgEntoloma mougeotii File:Dermoloma cuneifolium 73323.jpgDermoloma cuneifolium File:Clavaria fragilis IKAl 090920.jpgClavaria fragilis File:Velvety Earth Tongues.jpgTrichoglossum hirsutum The \\"CHEG\\" assessment system In 1995, Rald proposed a simple count of the number of Hygrocybe species present at a given site in order to assess its value as a waxcap grassland. He suggested that the presence of 17 or more species meant the site was of national importance, 9-16 species of regional importance, 4-8 species of local importance, and 3 or fewer of no importance. A year later, this system was modified by Rotheroe and others to include all the characteristic macrofungi and not just waxcaps. Known as the \\"CHEG\\" system, this is widely used in survey work today. The acronym \\"CHEG\\" stands for the main groups of relevant fungi: C - the clavarioid species; H - Hygrocybe species; E - Entoloma species; and G - the Geoglossaceae (earthtongues). More recently the modified term \\"CHEGD\\" has been used to include species of Dermoloma and Porpoloma (both Tricholomataceae) which also inhabit these grasslands . Conservation This decline in waxcap grasslands has been mainly the result of agricultural improvement of pastures by ploughing and reseeding, by manuring, and by the use of fertilizers and other chemicals.. The maintenance of a short sward by grazing or mowing (and removal or cuttings) has also been shown to be important for fruiting of waxcaps, with haycutting in July, followed by aftermath grazing/mowing to 3 cm having found to be optimal . In 1988, Arnolds estimated that only some 200 ha of unimproved waxcap grasslands remained in the Netherlands. As a result, both the grasslands and the larger fungi typical of such grasslands are of conservation concern, with the majority of species featuring in one or more national red lists of threatened fungi in Europe. In the United Kingdom, recent survey work has shown that surviving waxcap grasslands are more extensive than in many other European countries, thanks mainly to large areas of unimproved upland sheep pastures and also to many unimproved lawns (especially in churchyards and country houses) and amenity grasslands. Nonetheless, five species characteristic of waxcap grasslands - Entoloma bloxamii, Hygrocybe calyptriformis, Hygrocybe spadicea, Geoglossum atropurpureum, and Microglossum olivaceum - are or have been the subject of national Biodiversity Action Plans and waxcap grasslands as a specific habitat are the subject of several local Biodiversity Action Plans. Waxcap grassland surveys have been undertaken by the British Mycological Society, the National Trust, Plantlife, and the various national conservation bodies. As a result, several waxcap grassland sites, such as the banks of Llanishen and Lisvane Reservoirs in Cardiff and the lawns of Roecliffe Manor in Leicestershire, have been designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest, affording them some legal protection. A leaflet on managing waxcap grasslands in Britain and Ireland has been published by Plantlife and the Fungus Conservation Forum.

He is the founder and faculty director of the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) at U.C. Berkeley. His research focuses on African economic development and includes work on the economic causes and consequences of violence; the impact of ethnic divisions on local collective action; and interactions between health, education, environment, and productivity for the poor. He has conducted fieldwork in Kenya, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and India. More recently, Miguel has focused his efforts on increasing transparency in social science research. Along with colleagues, such as Michael Kremer, Esther Duflo, Dean Karlan and Abhijit Banerjee, he has pioneered the use of randomized controlled trials and other rigorous evaluation methods to test the impact of development interventions in the field. In 2019, Michael Kremer, Esther Duflo, and Abhijit Banerjee were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics for “their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.” The Nobel Prize’s Scientific Background on this award cited Miguel’s joint research with Michael Kremer on school-based deworming in Kenya, among several of his other studies.  Education  Miguel attended Tenafly High School in Tenafly, New Jersey, from which he graduated as the valedictorian of the class of 1992.Edward Miguel CV, University of California, Berkeley. Accessed December 26, 2015. \\"Tenafly High School, Tenafly NJ. Valedictorian 1992\\" He earned S.B. degrees in Economics and Mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996, where he was a Truman Scholar. In 2000 he completed a PhD in Economics at Harvard University with a thesis entitled Political economy of education and health in Kenya under the supervision of Michael Kremer, Abhijit Banerjee, Alberto Alesina, and Lawrence F. Katz where he was a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow.  Career  Miguel has been a Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley since 2000. He is also a Faculty Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and has been an Associate Editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics and Journal of Development Economics, and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors for Science. His research has been funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, USAID, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Bank, among others. In 2008, Miguel founded the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), a hub for research on global development. Headquartered at UC Berkeley, CEGA’s large, interdisciplinary network of over 100 West-Coast based faculty affiliates -- and a growing number of scholars from low- and middle-income countries -- identifies and tests innovations designed to reduce poverty and promote development. CEGA’s researchers use rigorous field trials, behavioral experiments, and tools from data science to measure and maximize the impacts of development programs throughout the world, generating actionable evidence for decision-makers. In 2011, CEGA launched the East Africa Social Science Translation (EASST) Collaborative, a research network aimed at promoting scientific evaluation of social and economic development programs in East Africa. EASST has invited and trained over 30 researchers from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia through semester-long fellowships at UC Berkeley, focused on diverse research topics related to health, education, governance, and agriculture. In 2002, Miguel co- founded the Working Group in African Political Economy (WGAPE), a network of US and Africa-based researchers that meet bi-annually to provide structured feedback on in-progress research papers related to the theme of African political economy. In 2004, Edward Miguel and Michael Kremer published the results of an impact evaluation on school-based deworming in Kenya. They determined that deworming is a cost-effective way to increase school attendance rates and improve community health. Their findings helped lead to the establishment of Deworm the World, a non-profit that works directly with governments and other organizations to expand school-based deworming worldwide in the following capacities: policy and advocacy with governments; prevalence surveying and mapping; program planning and management; public awareness and mobilization; monitoring and evaluation; training and distribution cascade; drug management and coordination. Deworm the World and the government initiatives it supports have treated over 280 million children in Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Subsequent work has shown long- term positive impacts of deworming on labor market outcomes,, including new research that shows children who received an additional 2 to 3 years of deworming earn higher wages, have higher household consumption and are more likely to live in urban areas. Their research was covered by several news outlets including The New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Chicago Tribune, NPR, and Vox. This included a piece by Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times on the importance of impact evaluations in determining policy. Miguel and co- authors Shankar Satyanath and Ernest Sergenti published a seminal 2004 research article that used annual variation in rainfall to estimate the impact of economic conditions on the civil war in sub-Saharan Africa. The study shows that a 5 percent negative growth shock increases the likelihood of civil conflict the following year by more than one half, suggesting that economic conditions are a critical determinant of civil war. Miguel and Raymond Fisman published a study in 2006, which compared the number of parking violations per UN diplomat in New York to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The results found a strong correlation between political corruption and parking tickets, highlighting the role of cultural norms and legal enforcement in corruption. The results were covered in the Economist, Forbes, The New York Times, NPR, The Guardian, CNN, and more. In 2008 Miguel and Fisman co-authored the book, Economic Gangsters: Corruption, Violence and the Poverty of Nations. It has been translated into eleven languages including Chinese, Persian, and German and Kristof praised it as \\"smart and eminently readable.\\" Miguel, Solomon Hsiang, and Marshall Burke published a study in 2013 that found strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across all major regions of the world. This paper garnered national and international media attention from sources including Time Magazine, The Economist,, and The Washington Post. Miguel also presented the results of the study in a Ted talk in 2014. In 2015, Miguel, Hsiang, and Burke published a study quantifying the effect of temperature on economic production across countries. The study was cited in a 2017 article in Science on combating climate change written by U.S. President Barack Obama. Both studies have been influential in climate policy and were cited in a special report on the impacts of global warming by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In 2012 Miguel helped launch the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS), which aims to promote transparency in empirical social science research. BITSS engages researchers through participatory forums on critical issues surrounding data transparency and encourages the use of study registries, pre-analysis plans, data sharing, and replication. In 2012, Miguel and co-authors published one of the first Economics research papers based on a pre-analysis plan. In 2014, Miguel and co-authors published a piece in Science that makes the case for better research transparency practices in the social sciences. In 2015, Miguel and co-authors published another price in Science on the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines. In 2019, Miguel, Garret Christensen, and Jeremy Freese published “Transparent and Reproducible Social Science Research,” a textbook on tools for increasing the rigor and credibility of social science research. Miguel gave a talk on the book at the 2019 National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute Methods Lecture. In 2016, Miguel co-founded the Berkeley Opportunity Lab, which generates rigorous evidence on critical issues surrounding poverty and inequality in the United States and other countries. In 2019, Miguel, Dennis Egger, Johannes Haushofer, Paul Niehaus, and Michael Walker released a high-profile study on the effects of an unconditional cash transfer program by the nonprofit organization GiveDirectly in rural Kenya. The study found positive effects for cash transfer recipients, in addition to large positive spillover effects for non- recipients. Co-authors estimate a local transfer payments multiplier greater than 2. These results were covered in the Washington Post, The Economist, NPR, and Vox.

Diplomatic career Walter Eytan (centre) signing the Israel-Egypt Armistice Agreement, 24 February 1949. Eytan moved to Jerusalem in 1946, becoming a spokesman for the Political Department of the Jewish Agency. He was also the first Principle of the Jewish Agency's Public Service College, established in 1946, which started with twenty-five students including five women.Eytan, Walter (1958) The first ten years. A diplomatic history of Israel. Weidenfeld and Nicolson N.6379. Page 191. On 9 January 1948 he presented the first draft of an \\"Outline Plan for the Foreign Office and Foreign Service of the Jewish State.\\" It proposed seven geographic divisions: Middle East, Europe, Eastern Europe, North American, Latin America, British Empire and Asia and Africa. There would also be six functional divisions: United Nations, Consular, Economic, Legal Information and Training and Research.Eytan, page 192. On 12 June 1948 he was able to leave Jerusalem and join the fledgling Foreign Ministry in a villa at Sarona in Tel Aviv. He was immediately appointed Director General. By July the ministry had a staff of over 100, including many former members of the Jewish Agency Political Department. One of the first decisions taken was what adjective should be used: Israelite and Israelian were rejected in favour of Israeli.Eytan, pages 197, 198. Eytan was the head of delegation to 1949 Armistice negotiations at Rhodes. The delegation included Yigal Yadin, Reuven Shiloah and Eliahu Sasson.Eban, page 137. He considered the Jordanian delegation to be \\"unimpressive ... helpless and lost\\"; he describes the Syrian delegation as \\"fiercely argumentative.\\"Bailey, Sydney D. (1982) Four Arab- Israeli wars and the peace process. (1990 edition). Pages 61, 63. On 16 March 1949 he was with Moshe Dayan and Yigael Yadin during an all night meeting with King Abdullah at his palace, El Shuneh, close to the Dead Sea.Dayan, Moshe (1976) Moshe Dayan: story of my life. . Page 141. He had another meeting with the King in Amman in October 1950. The King held the meeting against the wishes of his Ministers.Pappe, Ilan (1992) The making of the Arab Israeli conflict. 1947–1951. (1994 edition). Page 265. The following month Eytan led the Israeli delegation to the United Nations peace conference in Lausanne. One of the major issues discussed was what was to happen to Palestinian refugees who had left their homes during the fighting. In a statement, 5 May 1949, Eytan said: \\"It would be doing the refugees a disservice to let them (the refugees) persist in the belief that if they returned, they would find their houses or shops or fields intact ... any Arab house that survived the impact of war ... now shelters a Jewish family. There can be no return to the status quo ante.\\"Morris, Birth, page 255. His delegation's final compromise offer was that Israel would take control of the Gaza Strip with its residents including refugees and would accept the return of 100,000 refugees. At the time Eytan estimated that there were a total of 800,000 refugees.Morris, Birth, pages 283, 297. On the territorial issues the delegation was prepared to consider a compromise on Eilat, which Eytan was not convinced was of any strategic importance.Morris, Birth, page 274. By August 1949 it was understood by all the participants that the conference had failed. During Isser Be'eri's trial for the wrongful execution of Meir Tobianski he supported a member of the Foreign Ministry research department who leaked a secret document to the defence lawyers that implied Tobianski had passed information to the British.Steven, Stewart (1980) The Spymasters of Israel . Page 28. In December 1949 he asked the Israeli Army to stop mass deportations of Palestinians since large groups resulted in complaints being raised with the Mixed Armistice Commission. In particular the Foreign Ministry blocked an IDF plan to create a 5–10 km Arab-free zone along the Lebanon border.Morris, Benny (1987) The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947–1949. Cambridge University Press. . p. 242 He suggested that they \\"expel them in small groups or individually.\\"Morris, Benny (1993) Israel's border wars, 1949–1956: Arab infiltration, Israeli retaliation, and the countdown to the Suez War.

Due to the subsequent international criticism Eytan had to assure the US ambassador that those responsible would be punished.Morris, Border Wars, pages 150, 157. In 1951 he was a member of a four-man committee, including Yigal Yadin, Reuven Shiloah and Moshe Sharett, set up to consider special operations outside the borders of Israel. Up till then these had come under the responsibility of the Foreign Ministry's Political department. On 1 September 1951 a new department was created reporting directly to the Prime Minister – the Central Institute for Intelligence and Special Missions, known as Mossad. The long term decline of the Foreign Ministry's Research department and its inability to make its own intelligence assessments was one of the major findings of the 1974 Commission of inquiry into failings leading up to the 1973 war.Steven, pages 36, 38. In February 1953 Eytan criticised the effectiveness of IDF retaliation raids.Morris Border Wars, page 219. By 1958 the Foreign Service consisted of 682 official, 427 of whom were local to whichever state; there were 12 ambassadors, 15 ministers, 1 diplomatic representative, 3 charge d'affairs and 37 consul-generals and consuls. In addition the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem had 338 staff. Its 1957–1958 budget was 10,650,000 Shekels, just over £2,000,000.Eytan, page 196. In September 1965 he arranged a secret meeting in Paris between Foreign Minister Golda Meir and King Hussein of Jordan. This was the king's first high level meeting with an Israeli.Shlaim, Avi (2007) Lion of Jordan. The life of King Hussein in war and peace. (2008 edition). Page 221. 24 May 1967 Eytan arranged at very short notice a meeting in Paris between Foreign Minister Abba Eban and President General Charles de Gaulle to explain Israel's views on the growing crisis with Egypt. De Gaulle opened the meeting with the advice : \\"Ne faites pas la guerre.\\" The meeting ended with him insisting that Israel should not fire the first shot in any conflict.

History It is located at the Christ the King Seminary which in 1997 was the only theological faculty in the country where seminarians and religious received their doctrinal and pastoral formation for the priesthood. When an urgent need was felt for a relevant and sound theological formation of the religious and clergy to build up and strengthen of the local Church, the Franciscans and Dominicans started serious reflection on the possibility of a second theological faculty which would also be open to lay men and women who wished to undertake degree or diploma theological studies or in-depth Biblical and Theological studies for their faith formation. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of Pakistan (CBCP) approved the idea of a National Institute to provide theological formation in the spirit of renewal desired by the Second Vatican Council, in keeping with theological principles and the challenges faced by the Church in the Asia. Organisation All academic administration is the responsibility of Board of Governors which includes representatives of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Pakistan. It is a joint venture with collaboration among the Bishops and the religious orders, who also share responsibility. The Academic Staff emphasize special care to the deepening of theological education and formation in keeping with the changing realities which priests, religious and laity face.

Written for a very large orchestra, as the dual nature of the work's titles suggest, the composition represents a synthesis of ideas from Schnittke's earlier works.McBurney, Gerald (1990) Liner notes to Decca 430 698-2 The first movement of the symphony is the Concerto Grosso, with solos for violin, oboe and harpsichord. However unlike the traditional form of the concerto grosso, the sheer weight of the orchestral forces remains ever present, reminding the listener of the overarching (romantic) symphonic structure. The second movement is an elaboration of a piece of juvenilia by Gustav Mahler: an unfinished piano quartet, which the teenage Mahler started in 1876. However unlike a traditional 'theme and variations' approach, Schnittke begins with his own worked-out realisation of Mahler's idea, and unwinds it so that the movement concludes with the original material. The third movement is violent and climactic, which having reached a thunderous apex then moves purposefully into an allegro which, although it has a powerful sense of forward movement, breaks off suddenly and inconclusively. The fourth movement is a Mahlerian funeral march which does not dispel the unsettling atmosphere of what has gone before.McBurney, Gerald (1990) Liner notes to Decca 430 698-2 Schnittke wrote the piece to a commission by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra for its centenary in 1988, when it was premiered under Riccardo Chailly, the same forces recording it soon after.

Under this caliphate, members work toward uniting all Islamic countries as well as transforming secular, host countries into Islamic states. Hizb ut-Tahrir America's goals are the same as the global organization – the installation and implementation of Shariah law as the sole source of law. Hizb ut-Tahrir, which does not engage in political struggle in America, has chapters throughout the world which have caused a variety of security concerns leading to an outright ban of the organization from operating legally within several host countries. Some countries include Bangladesh, Egypt, England, Germany, Russia, Turkey and several other Arab countries. Furthermore, as a result of Hizb ut-Tahrir’s activities, the organization has undergone close scrutiny by countries like Australia, Azerbaijan, China, Denmark, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Chapter History Initially, the group struggled to find an identity and, more importantly, recruits. However, the group managed to keep recruitment to levels able to sustain the organization’s existence. While other HT groups around the world have expanded quickly, HTA has taken roughly two decades to establish a concrete presence within the U.S. The group is still wary of outsiders, however, wide use of the internet is now used for recruiting and spreading their message. Reasons for impotent beginnings are attributed to their founders’ paranoid mentality regarding possible Western “spies” and their suspicion of the internet. This state of mind appeared unnecessary to targeted Muslim recruits who found their paranoia unattractive and strange. However, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, HTA’s paranoid behavior seemed to justify itself after many Muslims felt unjust scrutiny over the terrorist attacks. HTA suspicion of the internet waned once they realized the large advantage in propagating their message via the World Wide Web. Also, it is thought that new, younger membership helped push the organization in this direction. While membership has grown, HTA is still very secretive in regards to its activities and membership. Those who attempt to learn more about the group are quickly confronted in an effort to stifle any knowledgeable discovery. If the HTA name is mentioned in the public realm, it must be done on their terms and conditions; those who attempt to highlight their existence are swiftly countered. Iyad Hilal began HTA activities in California, in the early 1990s. Despite HTA presence in the country for over two decades, the group’s membership size is unknown, Ideology The organization officially states: “Hizb ut-Tahrir is a political party whose ideology is Islam, so politics is its work and Islam is its ideology.” This belief is so strong that HT’s global site says, “Muslims in the United States are being dared, duped, and ultimately deceived into adopting voting in the kufr U.S. secular democracy/capitalism by the enemies of Islam…This is a satanic plan where elections are attempts to integrate Muslims.” The fact that participating in elections is a freedom, not obligatory action is not acknowledged by HT or HTA. Nonetheless, HTA is challenging the U.S. political system. In addition to HTA’s anti-Western sentiments, the group is also ardently anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. One HT leaflet read \\" one reading: “Jews are a people of slander. They are treacherous people who violate oaths and covenants. They lie and change words from the right places. They take the rights of the people unjustly, and kill the Prophets and the innocent.” According to John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org their final goal is to establish a global caliphate under Shariah law and impose the Islamic way of life worldwide. Methodology Pike also believes that fundamental goal of HTA is to \\"combat infidels\\" in the effort to establish Dar al-Islam, or the land where the rules of Islam are enforced. HTA’s aim is to incite abhorrence within the Muslim population against other Americans, laying the bedrock for a violent conflict. Madeleine Gruen wrote \\"A component of HTA's strategy is to instill a sense of alienation among American Muslims so that they will turn away from their country and instead identify themselves as members of the Ummah.\\" This is a, \\"strategy to isolate American Muslims from the rest of society.\\" To achieve this, HT will use fiery language to arouse Muslim passions: :“You must realize that the United States is an enemy state that works round the clock to subvert the interests of the Islamic Ummah. America is an enemy to the Muslims whether you :are in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh. America is making plans against you as Muslims whether you are part of a political party or not…So raise your voice against the American enemy and the government’s subservience to her. Otherwise your silence only gives strength to America enabling her to execute her plans. If they are not stopped immediately and decisively they will achieve an upper hand from which they can inflict greater harm…You must resist America before it is too late. Before she consolidates her foothold in the country like she has done in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. And stand with Hizb ut Tahrir and give your support to the party in re-establishing the Khilafah which will rule by the Qur’an and Sunnah, build a strong military and eliminate US and Britain- India’s control over the Muslim Ummah. HTA rhetoric covers a number of issues. For example, one issue, democracy, is “a satanic plan where elections are attempts to integrate Muslims,” according to the group. A former member recounts, “Hizb ut-Tahrir are not a terrorist organization, but they do believe in using violent force to remove a democratic government. This will not be done through the use of terrorism, rather by infiltrating armies in Muslim-majority countries.” HTA’s strategy is long-term, intending to achieve success through a patient persistence. John Pike argues that while the strategy is long-term, the plan is not an inactive, hap-hazard strategy; it consists of three carefully planned steps: #The first step encompasses educating a small group of supporters who propagate the tenets of HTA and become the base membership for the next two steps. Cells are established in this period. #The base then reaches out to fellow Muslims to educate and expand membership in preparation for the next and final step. Prominent members of government, the military, and other national power structures are a target so as to make the last step thoroughly achievable. #The last step is embarked upon once numbers within HTA reach critical mass – a strength capable to readily change the structure of government to an Islamic caliphate. Currently, HTA is undertaking the second step. While the second step is crucial to the process, many in the group are looking to the third which according to some estimates will be initiated in the near future. HTA is actively recruiting members and expanding its base, much of these activities have grown in post-9/11 years. HTA’s approach is hands-on and highly monitored. “Hizb ut-Tahrir is a totalitarian organization, akin to a disciplined Marxist-Leninist party, in which internal dissent is neither encouraged nor tolerated.”http://www.hudson.org/files/documents/Political_Insurgency.pdf As mentioned above, HTA takes full advantage of the freedoms offered within the U.S. to conduct anti-America activities and to proliferate their ideas. One key element which HTA calls attention to is Islamophobia. HTA consistently stresses Islamophobia which is used as a defense mechanism against criticism or external review. Recruitment As identified above, HTA is in the second phase of their three step strategy. This phase encompasses increasing membership to a critical mass strength. Once an individual becomes a member, they undergo an intense two year education process that has often been cited as period constructed to brainwash new inductees. This indoctrination period is secretive and is claimed to only encompass small-group meetings where their beliefs are taught. HTA also holds a presence on university campuses. HTA will recruit male students who then return to their native country and start an HT cell. The campus also plays an important role for HTA in the recruitment of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. Recruitment of international male students in the U.S. has become an important component of HTA activities. HTA will accept, in the recruitment, males and females of any colour or background. HTA also orchestrates conferences for the purposes of recruitment and for pushing their anti-American message. Also, HTA promotes their conferences through a well-coordinated social media campaign. Ties to terrorism The group has no confirmed links to terrorist groups, but has been banned in many countries on charges of terrorism.

Early life Brady was born in Forest City, Missouri, in 1870. His family moved to Nevada, Missouri when he was 12, where he eventually took a job at a shoe store. Here, he was the victim of a robbery. In 1890, at the age of 20, Brady headed for Creek Nation, Indian Territory, to seek his fortune in the as-yet-unfounded Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1895, Brady married Rachel Davis, who was part Cherokee. After the marriage, Brady was adopted into the Cherokee tribe and became a strong advocate for their tribal claims against Washington. Together they had two daughters and three sons. Vickery, Paul S. \\"Brady, Wyatt Tate (1870-1925).\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Activities in Tulsa history On January 18, 1898, Brady and other prominent businessmen signed the charter to incorporate Tulsa, thereby making it a city. Following the 1901 discovery of the Red Fork oil field, Brady built the Brady Hotel in 1903, hoping to take advantage of the oil boom by providing a hotel for oil executives and other traveling businessmen. It also served as a meeting ground for the Democratic Party. Active in politics, he was named to the Democratic National Committee in 1907, and backed anti-Klan candidate Jack Walton in 1922 gubernatorial election. Brady was known for hiring black people to work in his hotels and other businesses. Mabel B.

He hired several black boys as porters. But he told them up front, \\"Listen, boys: I'm gonna train you so you can get your own businesses someday.\\" A contracted Investigator hired by the NCLU accused Brady, in internal documents, of being one of the organizers behind the Tulsa Outrage of 1917, in which members of the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.) were tarred and feathered by the black-robed Knights of Liberty.\\"Modern Ku Klux Klan Comes into Being: Seventeen First Victims; Black Robed 'Knights of Liberty' Take Prisoners from Police to Lonely Ravine\\". Tulsa Daily World, November 10, 1917. According to the investigator, All 17 members of the I.W.W. identified Brady as the man who applied the tar and feathers. The investigator stated that he did not have sufficient evidence to prove this in a court of law. On November 6, 1917, Brady physically assaulted the owner of the Hotel Fox, E.L. Fox in broad daylight.Tulsa Daily World, November 7, 1917 Brady served as a night watchman during the 1921 Tulsa race riots. An article in the Tulsa Daily World stated \\"Tate Brady, proprietor of the Brady hotel, who was a member of white men on guard duty along North Main street all night, said he counted the bodies of five negroes. One negro was dragged behind an automobile, with a rope about his neck, throughout the business district.\\"Tulsa Daily World, June 1, 1921 In 1923, the Klan, established as the Tulsa Benevolent Society, paid $200,000 for the construction of a large \\"Klavern\\" or gathering hall that could seat 3,000 members. Beno Hall, as it was known, was located at 503 N. Main St. According to Tulsa County land records, that parcel of land was then owned by Rachel Brady, Brady's wife. Supporting a 1923 military tribunal, Brady stated that he, like his father before him, was a member of the Klan. He stated that he had quit the Klan because he was a Democrat and would not be told how to vote.August 1923, Testimonies transcripts from the Oklahoma military tribunal, Western Heritage Collection, papers of Governor Jack Walton, University of Oklahoma Libraries, Norman, Oklahoma.

The Brady Mansion still stands at 620 North Denver Avenue in Tulsa. Death Brady died by suicide on August 29, 1925, by shooting himself in the temple. He was said to be despondent over the death of his son, John Davis Brady who was killed in a car accident in spring 1925 while studying law at the University of Virginia. Legacy Brady was commemorated for his part in the founding of Tulsa by the names of Brady Street and Brady Heights. A controversy arose in 2013 over the appropriateness of naming a street for Brady, because of his membership in the KKK. On August 15, 2013, following months of debate, the Tulsa City Council voted 7–1 to change the street name to MB Brady Street, honoring Mathew B. Brady rather than Tate Brady. Mathew Brady was a famed Civil War photographer, but had no ties to Tulsa or Oklahoma. Initially, The Brady Arts District, the Brady Historical District, Brady Heights, and Brady Theater were not affected by the change, as they are named after the nearby street. In September 2017, the Brady Arts District Business Association voted to change the name of the district, located north of downtown, to the Tulsa Arts District in order to sever ties completely with the street's original namesake. https://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/business-association-makes-surprise- vote-to-rename-brady-arts- district/article_11f7d486-d37f-5c1c-94d6-d336e5f554ac.html On November 28, 2018, the Tulsa City Council voted 8–1 to rename \\"Mathew Brady Street\\" to \\"Reconciliation Way\\" effective July 1, 2019.

It was written by Charlie Grandy and directed by cast member John Krasinski. The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on October 6, 2011. The episode guest stars Mark Proksch as Nate and Hugh Dane as Hank the security guard. The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the entire warehouse staff quits after winning the lottery, leaving Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) to scramble for replacements while Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) temporarily get a taste of the warehouse life. \\"Lotto\\" received mixed reviews from television critics, with many enjoying Andy and Darryl's interaction. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by 5.82 million viewers and received a 3.2 rating/8 percent share among adult between the ages of 18 and 49, marking a slight drop in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"The Incentive\\". Synopsis The six warehouse workers win $950,000 in a lottery pool, and quit in a celebratory fashion of running through the office, making a mess and mooning the staff. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who was originally part of the pool but stopped when he was promoted, falls into a depression, unable to find any motivation to work and is further dismayed when his ex-wife's response to him not winning is to ask for the phone number of his pool-winner friend Glenn. Everyone else speculates how they would spend a hypothetical lottery score, with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) ultimately deciding to fuse their two main ideas into one for a lovely brownstone located in the great outdoors. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire replacements for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to even look at the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in for the day and make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but do not know how to use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor, resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client. A melancholic Darryl finally assembles a conference room meeting with several potential new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone to take charge of the process. Andy does not know what he is doing and all of the applicants walk out. Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself. Andy assembles three applicants: a bodybuilder from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD candidate who can only work two days a week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy to give him the manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only is not going to do that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn as the warehouse foreman, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants. Production \\"Lotto\\" was directed by John Krasinski. \\"Lotto\\" was written by co-executive producer and series writer Charlie Grandy. The episode was directed by cast member John Krasinski, who portrays Jim Halpert. This was the second episode directed by Krasinski for the series, after sixth season episode \\"Sabre\\". The episode guest stars Mark Proksch as Nate. Proksch initially appeared in \\"Sex Ed\\", and was hired by Dwight to be a handyman around the office. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim and the others trying to get the truck into the warehouse door but getting the truck stuck instead, Dwight trying to use Kevin as a bumper on the oil track, and Phyllis, Toby, and Ryan revealing what they would do if they won the lottery. Cultural references Pam tells Jim that in his lottery fantasy \\"we're Stephen King characters\\", due to his desire to live in Maine. During one sequence, the scene begins in medias res when Jim and Dwight are having a conversation about the films Message in a Bottle and The Postman, both of which involve Kevin Costner. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) mentions that, if he won the lottery, he would spend most of his money on launching his true crime podcast, called The Flenderson Files. During one part, Andy is sad when no one in the office appears to be a fan of Bob Newhart. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast on NBC, \\"Lotto\\" was viewed by 5.82 million viewers and received a 3.2 rating/8 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.2 percent all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked an 11 percent drop from the previous episode, \\"The Incentive\\" which made it one of the lowest-rated episodes of the series, slightly higher than the first season episode, \\"Health Care\\". =Reviews= \\"Lotto\\" received mixed reviews from television critics. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote highly of the serious dialogue in the episode, noting that \\"if there's been a consistent element to Paul Lieberstein's work on this show ... it's that he understands what makes the main characters tick, and is able to use that for real emotional resonance ... When the show wants to give Jim, or Pam, or Dwight, or now Andy a quiet, emotional moment, it's usually still able to do so very well, and that includes most of Andy and Darryl's interaction here in 'Lotto. He was, however, more critical of the episode's humor, noting that many of gags had been done before. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt called the episode superior to the previous episode commenting that \\"While perhaps not monumentally better than last week's outing and damaged by a weak B-story, 'Lotto' had a greater sense of purpose that holds greater value to the season as it moves forward\\". He also complimented the writers for not focusing too much on Andy. He ultimately gave the episode a \\"B\\". Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a seven out of ten, denoting a \\"good\\" episode. She wrote that the entry \\"felt like a mid-season episode, passably amusing, but nothing all that special or memorable\\". White did, however, call Pam and Jim's discussion about their lottery fantasy \\"the weakest part of the episode\\". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three out of five stars. He called the premise \\"an interesting buddy story\\" with \\"a tremendously inspiring speech from Andy to Darryl\\". Despite the lackluster rating, Forcella wrote that the episode had its fair share \\"of hilarious moments\\". Screencrave reviewer Jeffrey Hyatt awarded the episode a six out of ten and wrote that the episode was not an \\"a-plus episode [but] the show still delivered some kick-ass dialogue that had me laughing out loud.\\" Critical reception to Jim, Dwight, Kevin, and Erin in the warehouse was more mixed. Sepinwall criticized the warehouse subplot for \\"selling them [the characters] out for the sake of a joke\\". Forcella, who gave the majority of the episode a positive review, was more critical of the installments subplot. Andrew Daglas of ChicagoNow, on the other hand, was more positive towards the subplot, calling it \\"generally amusing\\". He called \\"Ellie Kemper with a smudge of dirt\\" on her face \\"totes adorbs.\\"  Notes  References External links * \\"Lotto\\" at NBC.com * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:The Office (American season 8) episodes ","title":"Lotto (The Office)"},{"id":"33144505","text":"The Central District of Divandarreh County () is a district (bakhsh) in Divandarreh County, Kurdistan Province, Iran.

His fifth album, it was released by Fantasy Records as a two-disc LP record in 1976. How Late'll Ya Play 'Til? was recorded in California. The first disc was recorded at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, the Record Plant in Sausalito, and Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles. The second disc was recorded live, on June 18 and 19, 1976, at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. The album was released on CD as two separate titles. How Late'll Ya Play 'Til? Volume 1: Live contains all six tracks from the second disc of the double LP, along with two additional tracks, \\"Loaded and Laid\\" and \\"Make Me a Pallet\\", that were not on the LP release. How Late'll Ya Play 'Til? Volume 2: Studio contains all eleven tracks from the first disc, along with three added tracks — \\"Kitchen Girl,\\" \\"Long Afternoons\\" and \\"Nashville Again\\". Critical reception When the album was released, Billboard wrote, \\"...in his first LP for Fantasy [Bromberg] is taking a solid commercial shot at presenting his specialized style in the most elegant support package possible. This is a twin-disk set, evenly divided between live and studio cuts. Bromberg's virtuoso guitar picking and insinuating voice is backed with a horn group that comes on like a cross between the Dirt Band and Springsteen's E-St. group. The leader flashes brightly through his own tongue-in-cheek originals and raunchy blues ballads by the likes of Blind Willie McTell or Robert Johnson. A well-thought-out fan winner.\\" Reviewing the record for Allmusic, William Ruhlmann said, \\"Bromberg's band, with two horns and a fiddle player, is capable of playing just about any style of popular music, and most of them are here on a double album, half recorded in the studio and half live. (Fantasy has also issued the two discs separately.) The standout inclusion is Bromberg's \\"Will Not Be Your Fool\\", which became his onstage showstopper from here on out.\\" In Allmusic's review of the Volume 1: Live CD, Richard Foss wrote, \\"David Bromberg has been such an effective sideman for so long, it could be possible to not notice what a wonderful entertainer the man is when he is at center stage. How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?, Vol. 1 catches Bromberg and a crack band having a fine time on mostly humorous tunes. Of course, Bromberg does play guitar throughout the album, but the real attraction here is his bluesy vocal turns and his razor- sharp comedic timing. Though \\"Will Not Be Your Fool\\" is his signature piece and is very well performed here, the highlight is the incredible \\"Bullfrog Blues\\".\\" Track listing =LP disc one — CD Volume 2: Studio= :LP side 1: #\\"Danger Man II\\" (David Bromberg) – 3:40 #\\"Get Up and Go\\" / fiddle tunes (Bromberg / traditional, arranged by Bromberg) – 4:46 #\\"Summer Wages\\" (Ian Tyson) – 3:53 #\\"Dallas Rag\\" / \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (arranged by David Laibman / arranged by Bromberg) – 1:43 #\\"Whoopee Ti Yi Yo\\" (traditional, arranged by Bromberg) – 2:55 #\\"Young Westley\\" (Mary McCaslin) – 3:10 :LP side 2: # * \\"Dyin' Crapshooter's Blues\\" (Willie McTell) – 3:38 #\\"Bluebird\\" (Bromberg) – 2:09 #\\"Idol with a Golden Head\\" (Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller) – 3:47 #\\"Chubby Thighs\\" (Steve Burgh) – 4:20 #\\"Kaatskill Serenade\\" (Bromberg) – 4:40 :CD bonus tracks: # * \\"Kitchen Girl\\" (traditional) – 2:12 #\\"Long Afternoons\\" (Paul Siebel) – 4:10 #\\"Nashville Again\\" (Siebel) – 3:29 =LP disc two — CD Volume 1: Live= :LP side 3: #\\"Sloppy Drunk\\" (Bromberg) – 4:05 #\\"Bullfrog Blues\\" (Bromberg, Terwilliger) – 16:06 :LP side 4: # * \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" (Robert Johnson) – 3:54 #\\"Come On in My Kitchen\\" (Johnson) – 3:10 #\\"Will Not Be Your Fool\\" (Bromberg) – 7:59 #\\"Such a Night\\" (Mac Rebennack) – 4:41 :CD bonus tracks: # * \\"Loaded and Laid\\" (David McKenzie) – 3:19 #\\"Make Me a Pallet\\" (Joe Parish) – 6:07 Personnel =Musicians= *David Bromberg – electric guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin, vocals *Lem Burger – electric guitar *Steve Burgh – guitar *Cam and Bert Cheese – electric guitar *Hank DeVito – pedal steel guitar *Peter Ecklund – trumpet, mellophone, cornet *Dick Fegy – electric guitar, banjo, tenor banjo, mandolin *John Firmin – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, baritone saxophone, clarinet *Le Grand Fromage – guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals *Nathan Gershman – cello *Brantley Kearns – fiddle, electric fiddle, mandolin, vocals *Phil Kearns – vocals *George Kindler – fiddle *Bernie Leadon – vocals *Curt Linberg – trombone *Hugh McDonald – bass, vocals *Steve Mosley – drums, vocals *Alex Nieman – viola *Herb Pedersen – vocals *Mac Rebennack – piano *Jim Rothermel – recorder *Jane Sharp – vocals *Phoebe Snow – vocals *Evan Stover – fiddle =Production= *Steve Burgh – producer *David Bromberg – producer *Phil Kaffel – recording engineer, sides 1 and 2 *Tom Flye – recording engineer, sides 3 and 4 *Rich Ehrman – assistant recording engineer, sides 3 and 4 *Doug Rider – additional recording *Warren Dewey – remix *George Tutko – remix assistant *Lee Hulko – mastering *Phil Carroll – art direction *Lance Anderson – design *Phil Bray – photography References Category:David Bromberg albums Category:1976 albums Category:Fantasy Records albums Category:Albums recorded at the Great American Music Hall ","title":"How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?"},{"id":"33144569","text":"Venerius () was Archbishop of Milan from 400 (or 401) to 408.

Venerius was elected bishop after the death of Simplician in the winter between 400 and 401. He was already bishop of Milan when he received a request by a provincial synod held on June 18, 401 at Carthage to send in North Africa some clerics from Milan. One of the clerics sent was actually Paulinus. Venerius is also known from a letter written to him by Pope Anastasius I concerning the condemnation of the ideas of the Origenists. He is also mentioned in a letter of the same pope to John II, Bishop of Jerusalem. In 404 Venerius, along with Pope Innocent I and Chromatius, bishop of Aquileia, took a stand in favour of St. John Chrysostom who has been unjustly banned from Constantinople, writing in his favour to Honorius, the Western emperor, who sent this letter to his brother, Arcadius, the Eastern emperor. This intercession, however, availed nothing. Venerius died on May 4, 408, and he was buried in the Church of Saint Nazarius and Celsus in Milan. A late tradition, with no historical basis, associates Venerius with the Milan's family of the Oldrati.

Controversy also exists regarding its translation. Illustration of the Assyrian tablet K. 3364 from the British Museum (1901). Discovery The tablet (now considered to be a copy of an older Babylonian source) was discovered alongside the seven creation tablets of the Enûma Eliš in the ruined Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh and was by George Smith (1876) originally considered to have been a fragment of the \\"Tablet VI\\" detailing the Babylonian creation myth, specifically the creation of man by Marduk (or Merodach, Mirku) and his instructions to mankind.\\"The Chaldean Account of Genesis\\", 1876, George Smith, London, pp.78-86.

The archaeologist Leonard William King however discovered in 1902 that the tablet was not a fragment of the Enûma Eliš, but a separate tablet source listing a brief creation story, but mostly moral precepts assigned to the Babylonian God Marduk.\\"The Seven Tablets of Creation\\", 1902, p. 90 (footnote), p. 202 (Appendix II). The tablet was later donated to the British Museum, from which the tablet derived its name.CUNEIFORM TEXTS FROM BABYLONIAN TABLETS, &c.;, IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. PART XIII. 1901. Plate 29-30. A replica tablet of K. 3364 but belonging to the Neo-Babylonian period was also discovered in the late 19th century and also belongs to the British Museum (No. 33851). Translation and Controversy The first translation of the tablet (both reverse and obverse) appeared in George Smith's Chaldean Account of Genesis (1876). Smith erroneously assumed that the tablet's list of moral laws or instructions were meant for the \\"newly created pair (man and woman) instructing them in their duties\\".Smith, 1876, p. 78. Theophilus Pinches and Leonard William King however corrected Smith's misinterpretation, since the instructions or moral laws on the tablet are in fact assigned to Marduk, but the tablet does briefly describe the creation of man.\\"The Old Testament...\\", Kessinger Publishing, 2005 (reprint), Pinches, p. 29.King, 1902, p. 202. Controversy arose specifically over line 18 on the obverse of the tablet since (in Smith's translation) it refers to the creation of a \\"dark race\\" (zalmat-qaqadi) by Marduk: =Theories= Various different theories have been proposed about the meaning of the \\"dark race\\" (line 18) since Smith's translation: Symbolic Gerald Massey argued the \\"dark race\\" (zalmat-qaqadi) of K.3364 is purely symbolic and not ethnological.\\"Book of the Beginnings\\", Vol. 2, Gerald Massey, Cosimo, Inc., 2007, p. 470. Dark \\"red\\" skinned George Smith proposed that the \\"dark race\\" (zalmat-qaqadi) were the original inhabitants of Babylon (and the surrounding area of Mesopotamia) connecting them to the same race as the \\"Adamites\\", or descendants of (Biblical) Adam, writing: \\"in various other fragments of these legends they are called Admi or Adami, which is exactly the name given to the first man in Genesis\\".Smith, 1876, pp.85-86. The \\"dark race\\" connection to Adam was further popularised by Archibald Sayce who noted that the Akkadian word Adamatu, meaning \\"dark red\\" (earth),\\"A concise dictionary of Akkadian\\", Jeremy A. Black, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2000, p. 4. appears closely connected to the etymology of Adam and that it relates to dark red skin.\\"Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments\\", Kessinger Publishing, 2003 (reprint) Sayce, p. 27f.\\"The Chaldean Account of Genesis\\", 1876, George Smith, Ed. Sayce, 1880, p. 83.

The root of the word Adam is dam, meaning blood and some scholars have shown the parallels between this and the creation of man as described in the Enûma Eliš (Tablet VI). In Hebrew also, adom translates as \\"ruddy\\" or \\"red\\", while adamah as \\"red soil\\".Strong's Hebrew DictionaryStrong's Hebrew Dictionary Furthermore, according to Josephus (c. 94 AD): \\"This man was called Adam, which in the Hebrew tongue signifies one that is red, because he was formed out of the red earth\\".Antiquities, book 1, chapter 1, section 2. Sayce, acknowledging the aforementioned links believed that the \\"dark race\\" described in K. 3364 (line 18) was a dark reddish skinned aboriginal race of \\"primitive Babylonia\\" that were invaded by a white skinned Semitic race.\\"The Chaldean Account of Genesis\\", 1876, George Smith, Ed. Sayce, 1880, pp. 82-83. According to Sayce, the original \\"dark race\\" were Sumerians of the Turanid race, who \\"belonged to the dark-skinned division, though it is not necessary to suppose them to have been black as the Negro\\".Sayce, 1880, pp.82-84. Note: In Sayce's literature the Sumerians are found wrongly called \\"Accadians\\". This was before scholars had understood the Semitic Akkadians were distinct to the Sumerians. Henry Rawlinson supported Sayce's views and further asserted that the ancient Babylonians knew of two principle races, as found in their inscriptions: \\"the Adamu, or dark race and the Sarku, or light race\\".Smith, 1876, p. 86. The Sarku (or Sarcu) Sayce and Rawlinson maintained were the Semitic colonists who were white skinned.\\"An Elementary Grammar\\", Sayce, Samuel Bagster and Sons, 1877, p. 3. Rawlinson believed that both the aboriginal \\"dark race\\" and light skinned Semitic colonists are found preserved in Genesis. 6:1–7 as the \\"sons of God\\" and the \\"daughters of man\\".Smith, 1876, p. 86; Sayce, 1880, pp.83-84. Sayce concluded by asserting that the Sarku modified Adam to denote their own \\"white Semitic population\\" after the dark red skinned Sumerian aborigines were conquered.\\"Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments\\", Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 27; Sayce, 1880, pp.83-84. Rawlinson equated the original \\"dark race\\" of Babylon to a \\"dark Caucasoid race\\", which in terms of later definition became defined as the Ethiopid race (Cushites).Quoted in \\"The historical evidences of the truth of the Scripture records\\", United States Book Co., 1800, George Rawlinson, p. 279f. Alexander Winchell, a Professor of Paleontology and history author discussed the racial identity of the \\"dark race\\" of K.3364 in his work Pre-adamites (1880) from which he maintained the \\"dark race\\" were sunburnt Hamites of the Mediterranean race.\\"Preadamites; or, A demonstration of the existence of men before Adam\\", Griggs and company, 1880, pp.158-159, p. 476. Similar conclusions were also drawn by Herbert Spencer in his The Principles of Sociology (1885).\\"The Principles of Sociology\\", 1, Volume 6; Volume 1884, Appleton, 1885, p. 809. Black haired Some scholars have argued that the \\"dark race\\" (zalmat-qaqadi) in line 18 of K.3364 refers to the \\"black-headed\\" Sumerians, as their name suggests they derived it from the fact they were black haired.\\"The Quest for Sumer\\", Leonard Cottrell, Putnam, 1965, p. 139. An array of earlier prominent Assyriologists have supported this position, noting that the aborigines of ancient Mesopotamia would only have employed such a name for themselves if they had encountered another people who possessed a different physiognomy, specifically fairer (blonde) hair: \\"this implies that there was also a blond race in the country from which their black hair and eyes distinguished them\\".\\"Huxley memorial lecture\\", Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 1902, p. 162ff. Laurence Waddell was also a notable proponent of this theory, but maintained that the Sumerian royal dynasty was blonde (Aryan) while the lower masses (or 'subject' people) dark black haired primitives.\\"Makers of Civilization in Race and History\\", 1929, p. 3. The \\"dark race\\" (zalmat-qaqadi) has then been suggested to only refer to the black hair of the Sumerian aborigines of Mesopotamia (Fertile Crescent) and not their skin complexion. Although some argue the \\"dark race\\" refers to both a dark skinned and black haired population. Negroid Afrocentrics argue that the \\"dark race\\" (zalmat-qaqadi) refers to a Black African (Negroid) race, although anthropological and DNA studies undertaken on Sumerian remains do not support this assertion, nor do linguistics connect the Sumerians to any known Negroid language. “The proto-Afro-Asiatic group carrying the E-P2 mutation may have appeared at this point in time and subsequently gave rise to the different major population groups including current speakers of the Afro- Asiatic languages and pastoralist populations.” References & Footnotes Category:Cuneiform * ","title":"K.3364"},{"id":"33144588","text":"Zarrineh (, also Romanized as Zarrīneh) is a city and capital of Karaftu District, in Divandarreh County, Kurdistan Province, Iran.

Juventa Starachowice played in the III liga. They played home games at the Stadion Miejski. Previous to the establishment of the football club in 1996, the amateur sporting organisation also had an interest in tennis and athletics. History The club was founded on the initiative of a dozen supporters of sport and recreation and with the organisation and kindness of the Parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help and the South Elementary School No. 13. Since the beginning the club the organisation has set about shaping the attitudes and morals of the youth along with recreation and amateur sport. Initially, the club had a major interest in tennis and athletics, however in 1996 it was decided that a football team would be established which would be coached by Chris Zuba. Four years later (in 2000) sections in the club parted. Athletics remained in \\"Juvencie-Marbo\\" while the players created the Catholic Section of the Autonomous Sports Football Club, \\"Juventa\\" Starachowice. At junior level the club had many successes, winning a number of tournaments however in 2005 it was decided to start a senior team which joined the Class A tournament under the name \\"Juventa-Star.\\" This team was financially supported by a committee of \\"100\\". In the first season \\"Juventa-Star\\" won promotion to the class of the district, the top scorer of the A-Class won by local Konrad Tchurz.

In the 2007/08 season under the leadership of the first coach from \\"outside\\" Starachowice, the club won promotion to the fourth league. Due to the reputation of then coach Arkadiusz Bilski, the club was able to sign many high-profile players including several with experience in a top-flight. In the first season in the third league Starachowice achieved seventh position in the table, and a year later took on a higher place. With the end of the 2010/11 season the club resigned from the sponsoring company Perfopol, so the band returned to name \\"Juventa\\" Starachowice.

The condition index is its actual weight divided by its expected weight, times 100%. A fish of normal weight has a condition index of 100 percent. So if a tarpon, for example, has a condition index of 104 percent, that would mean it is above the normal weight for an average tarpon of that length. If a tarpon has a condition index of 92 percent, that would mean that it is thinner, or below the normal weight of other tarpon that length. The condition index depends on how much a fish is eating compared to the energy it has to spend to live, migrate, reproduce, and do its other activities. The condition index for fish is a simple measurement that can be used to provide important biological information that can then be used to make better management decisions. Definition and Calculation The condition index in fish is a way to measure the overall health of a fish by comparing its weight with the average weight of other fish of the same length and kind. Southern Illinois University slide presentation describing Condition Index and Relative Weight in fish. Accessed 26 August, 2011. To do this, a weight-length relationship that is published in a journal or a reliable report is used to make the comparison. Some weight-length relationships are for a group of the same fish from a certain location; others are developed from much data from various locations and represent a more general result. Some studies have enough data to develop separate weight-length relationships for male and female fish of the same species, and/or to develop separate weight-length relationships for different seasons of the year (e.g. spring and fall). To compute the condition index of an individual fish, it must be weighed and its length measured. Some weight-length relationships use the total length of the fish while others use the fork length. It is important to measure the same kind of length that the reference relationship uses. It is also important to have the weight and length in the same units as the reference relationship. Weight vs. Length for Red Drum (data from Jenkins 2004).The reference weight- length formula is used to calculate how much the individual fish would be expected to weigh based on its measured length. Then the condition index is the actual weight of the fish divided by its expected weight, times 100%. A condition index greater than 100% means the individual fish weighs more than expected, while a condition index less than 100% means the individual fish weighs less than expected for its length. Since the condition index is used to assess the health of fish, it is important to have a reliable reference weight-length relationship. For example, a red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) caught in the spring in waters off of the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, U.S., is expected to have a weight-length relationship of W = 0.000005297L3.110, where W is the weight in grams and L is the total length in millimeters.Jenkins, J.A. Fish Bioindicators of Ecosystem Condition at the Calcasieu Estuary. National Wetlands Research Center, USGS Report 2004-1323, 2004. Consider one red drum that is 400 millimeters long and has a weight of 616 grams. Based on the reference weight-length relationship, a red drum that is 400 mm long is expected to have a weight of 655 grams. The condition index for that fish is its actual weight divided by its expected weight times one hundred percent, or (616g/655g)x100% = 94%. The fish in this example is below its expected weight, and a scientist might then look for more information to find out if other red drum in the area are also below expected weight. If red drum in the study area tend to be below expected weight, then the scientist might further investigate why this might be. Applications Even though it is a simple calculation once a good weight-length relationship is available, the condition index has several important applications. For example, it can be used to compare the health of a specific group of fish to an accepted standard. It can be used to track the health of a group of fish as a function of size (for example, one might see a jump in condition index when a fish is big enough to eat larger prey). Condition index can also be used to compare the relative health of two competing types of fish in the same body of water. Barakat and colleaguesBarakat A., et al. Feed regimen affects growth, condition index, proximate analysis and myocyte ultrastructure of juvenile spinefoot rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus Aquaculture Nutrition Volume 17, Issue 3, pages e773–e780, June 2011. used condition index to measure the effectiveness of different feeding programs in aquaculture of juvenile spinefoot rabbitfish. Condition index in fish can be used to make management decisions such as fishing limits in specific areas. For example, Ratz and Lloret (2002) observed that Atlantic cod living in colder waters, such as Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank, were in poorer condition than cod living in warmer waters such as the North Sea and Irish Sea. They suggest that the warmer waters might be able to support higher fishing rates than the colder waters.Ratz, H-J, Lloret,J. Variation in fish condition between Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks, the effect on their productivity and management implications Fisheries Research Volume 60, Issues 2-3, February 2003, Pages 369-380. Some have suggested using condition index in living organisms as a bioindicator of the health of other parts of the environment in which it lives. The condition index is basically the relative fatness of the organism, which represents energy reserves, and Stevenson and Woods (2006) suggested that it can be used as an indication of the quality of the habitat and to guide the expectation of how successful reproduction might be. Stevenson, RD, Woods, WA. Condition indices for conservation: new uses for evolving tools. Integrative and Comparative Biology 46(6):1169-1190, 2006. Jenkins (2004) specifically used fish in the Calcasieu Estuary of the Louisiana Gulf Coast to assess possible negative impacts of environmental contaminants.Jenkins, J.A. Fish Bioindicators of Ecosystem Condition at the Calcasieu Estuary. National Wetland Research Center, USGS Report 2004-1323, 2004.

Gilbert was born in Puckshipton, Wiltshire, England, in the Vale of Pewsey. The second of four sons, his father was Joseph Gilbert and his mother, Jane (née Pike). He studied at Marlborough College in Wiltshire and learnt about vine-growing and winemaking on the European mainland. He migrated to South Australia in 1839 on the Buckinghamshire and immediately erected his prefabricated two-roomed Manning cottage on an Adelaide allotment. He acquired a property on the South Para River and stocked it with sheep purchased from Van Diemen's Land. He later moved his flock to a selection near Lyndoch, which he named \\"Pewsey Vale\\" and developed into an ideal country home. In 1847 he established Pewsey Vale winery in Eden Valley, the same year Jacob's Creek winery was established in the neighbouring Barossa Valley, with substantial cellars, and Pewsey Vale clarets, burgundies and hocks achieved considerable success. He married Anna Browne (1812–1873) in 1848. Her brothers Dr. William James Browne (1815 – 4 December 1894) and Dr. John Harris Browne (1817–1904) made a wedding present of the property \\"Wongalere\\" near Williamstown. Joseph's brother William emigrated to South Australia and leased Wongalere for ten years, after which it was managed by Joseph's son, also called William. In 1872 he acquired leases 3-5 in the Northern Territory, just north of Oodnadatta. His son William, in company with James Churchill-Smith and E. M. \\"Ted\\" Bagot (whose father E. M. \\"Ned\\" Bagot had acquired leases 1&2) drove 1,000 head of cattle from Adelaide to the MacDonnell Ranges. Gilbert was a member of the South Australian Jockey Club and raced several good horses, notably Ace, Ace of Trumps (1874 Adelaide Cup winner), Skylark, Lapdog and Poodle. Joseph and Anna Gilbert and several of their descendants were buried at the Pewsey Vale Anglican Cemetery built on land excised from their property in 1861; around half the graves or memorials are for members of the Gilbert family. Family Joseph Gilbert married Anna Browne (26 April 1812 – 28 September 1873), sister of Dr. W. J. Browne, at \\"Wongalere\\" on 21 January 1848. They had three children: *William Gilbert (12 October 1850 – 29 March 1923) born at \\"Pewsey Vale\\", married Mary Young Clindening (26 January 1854 – 7 May 1939) on 22 July 1879; further developed the Pewsey Vale Estate. For details of their large family, see his article. *Jane Gilbert (14 August 1852 – 21 January 1936) married Edward Charles Stirling MB FRCS (8 September 1848 – 20 March 1919) on 27 June 1877. *Sarah Gilbert (24 June 1856 – 25 May 1936) married Colonel John Adam Dalrymple-Fergusson (7 May 1845 – 5 December 1920) on 31 July 1871 and retired to England.

It takes its name from the Bishop's House, the official residence of the Bishop of Copenhagen, on the other side of Studiestræde. The square is dominated by the main entrance of Church of Our Lady which faces it on the other side of Nørregade. The Reformation Memorial which stands in the middle of the square is from 1943. History Bispetorv was established in connection with C. F. Hansen's rebuilding of Church of Our Lady after its destruction in the British bombardment of the city during the Battle of Copenhagen. As properties which occupied the site had also been destroyed, Hansen was successful in having the Establishment take over the lots, and he also designed the surrounding buildings. Bispetorv, c. 1902 Hansen's buildings were sold in 1899 and demolished to make way for a new building for Studentersamfundet, a student society which had been founded in 1882. The new building, was designed by C. F. Jeppesen og Carl Thonning in a National Romantic style at the corner of Studiestræde, topped by a steep pyramidical roof. In 1916 the building was sold and redesigned by Gotfred Tvede who removed the tower and adapted it to a more sober, Neo-Classical design. In 1949 the building was acquired by the University of Copenhagen, which already had a number of buildings in the area, and it became known as the Bispetorv Annex. Reformation Memorial A monument in the centre of the square commemorates the Reformation of Denmark. It was inaugurated on 6 June 1943. The monument was designed by the sculptor Max Andersen and architect Harald Lønborg-Jensen. It consists of a column decorated with reliefs and inscriptions on all four sides. The reliefs present key events from the Reformation.

Death  Lê Hoàng Hung was burned in his bed and taken to the Long An General Hospital in southern Long An, Vietnam. Hung suffered from severe burns on over 20 percent of his body. Because of the severity of his burns, he was transferred to Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. He died on January 29, which was ten days after the attack from his burns.Committee to Protect Journalists 2011. \\"Vietnamese journalist critically injured in fiery attack\\" Retrieved September 15, 2011 CPJ. Just before his death, Hung told investigators that he was sleeping when he felt someone pouring something cold on his body which immediately started to burn. Tran Thi Thuy Lieu, Hung's wife, said that an unknown assailant had broken into Hung's house in Tân An, Vietnam, in the middle of the night, doused the reporter with some sort of chemicals, and set Hung on fire. She told authorities that Hung had received several threatening text messages before the incident. Initially the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders reported that Hung had been killed for his reporting of misconduct in the Mekong Delta region, and police also thought someone was getting revenge. A rope was found hanging from the second story where Hung was burnt, indicating that the culprit could have climbed up on that rope. However, police confirmed that the rope is just a ploy to distract investigators. The police said that it is very difficult to attach the rope to the second-floor balcony from the ground floor without an insider's help. Also according to the newspaper, there was no evidence showing the rope had been climbed on. It was also regarded as suspicious that Hung went to sleep that night alone without closing the main door or the windows although the night was very cold. Context A photograph of Hung's torched bed was published in Vietnam shortly after his death and created public awareness about the journalist's death. Fatal attacks against journalists in Vietnam have been rare. Most journalists who had died in Vietnam had died covering the Vietnam War, such as Larry Burrows or Dickey Chapelle. The last foreign journalist to be killed in Vietnam was in 1979 when Japanese journalist Isao Takano was shot near the Vietnam-Chinese border in Lạng Sơn. The last case of a Vietnamese journalist having been murdered on account of duties was Duong Hung Cuong in 1988 while he was being held by authorities. Impact Investigative journalists, like Hung, have been important in changing the media culture of Vietnam, which has allowed government corruption to be exposed. Hung had to write about sensitive issues in a country where media are state owned, the media support the government in a communist press model, and journalists face restrictions.UNESCO, Communication and Information. \\"Vietnam.\\" Retrieved 29 October 2011. UNESCO While the killing of journalists seldom happens in Vietnam, Reporters Without Borders ranked Vietnam 165 of 178 countries on press freedom in 2010. Hung's colleagues in Vietnam had called for an investigation into his death because of his reporting on sensitive issues and police were initially also focused on this motive. This brought international attention to press safety concerns in Vietnam. The Committee to Protect Journalists has been active in order to make sure that there is no impunity in cases where journalists are murdered. Shawn Crispin, CPJ's senior Southeast Asia representative, said shortly after his death, \\"The government signaled its commitment to protecting journalists in a media decree earlier this month and until this crime is solved that commitment will have gone unfulfilled.\\" Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, issued the following statement shortly after his death:\\"I condemn the brutal attack on Le Hoang Hung that caused his death. Freedom of expression is a key ingredient of democratic societies, vital to the rule of law, and it must be protected. Le Hoang Hung’s death must be fully investigated and his attacker brought to justice.\\" Police investigated the murder and even reopened the case later after the wife had already admitted to the killing after inconsistencies between the confession and the evidence were noticed. The result of the further investigation was reported in October by Tuổi Trẻ news that police believe that Lieu had acted alone.Tuổi Trẻ. \\"Police confirm husband-burning wife acted alone.\\" 20 October 2011. Retrieved 2 November 2011 Tuoi Tre Tran Thi Lieu  BBC News reported on 23 February 2011, Tran Thi Lieu, who was 40 years old, was in police custody and authorities had discovered that she had amassed debts of \\"one billion dong ($47,000, £29,000)\\" from gambling excursions to Cambodia.BBC News. 23 February 2011. \\"Vietnam journalist Le Hoang Hung's wife held for murder.\\" Retrieved 31 October 2011 BBC News Police were conducting an \\"expanded investigation\\" to check if anybody else had been involved and were holding Lieu for 4 months beginning 30 June 2011. Police discovered that Hung's wife Tran Thi Lieu had a gambling problem, Hung and his wife had argued about money and that he had an insurance policy should he be killed. Police confirmed that Lieu did owe VND1 billion (US$51,000) from gambling in Cambodia. A source told Tuoitrenews that she wanted to sell the house to settle the debt but Hung refused. An unconfirmed source told Tuổi Trẻ that the victim had bought a life insurance with a payout of VND1 billion several months before his death. Lieu, as his wife, is of course the main beneficiary. Drivers of taxis and rental cars she used to on her gambling trips to Cambodia said that Lieu carried along VND30-100 million (US$1,500-5,100) in cash per trip. One regular driver even saved her number on his cell phone as \\"ZKC L.Casino\\". However, Lieu denied any gambling, insisting she went to casinos only to sell wet cloth tissues to gamblers there. Police found Lieu lied about the gambling. In 2010, she made 22 trips to Cambodia to visit casinos there. Tran Thi Lieu was convicted of murder with \\"vile motives\\" and sentenced to life in prison on 29 March 2012.  Career  Hung was a print reporter for Nguoi Lao Dong (The Worker), where he mostly covered corruption and crime stories. Hung had covered misconduct in the Mekong Delta region.

Pavle Bakić had a timar, as did his father, and held great estates around Venčac in Šumadija called \\"Bakić's land\\". He was highly viewed of by the Ottoman Empire, and had the rights to collect taxes (kharaj) from his people. In talks with Pál Tomori and Louis II of Hungary, he left his land with his family, five brothers (including Petar Bakić), and a great number of Serbs, into Hungary, and in return he received the town of Lak among other estates. With his forces he participated in the Battle of Mohács in 1526. When the succession war between Ferdinand I and John Zápolya started, he took the side of Zápolya. After the defeat of Zápolya in the Battle of Tokaj in 1527, he sided with Ferdinand and would stay faithful to him for the rest of his life. In 1528, Ferdinand confirmed Bakić and his brothers' holdings and appointed him the captain of the Serbian infantry, cavalry and river forces. In the defence of Vienna in 1529, Bakić was an important aspect with his cavalry. In charters of 1534, Ferdinand again confirmed Bakić and his brothers' holdings (Lak, Győr, Szombathely, Hédervár and all estates that were part of these towns). The fortress of Győr was administered by his Hungarian ally Count György Cseszneky. A charter dated September 20, 1537, titles him as Despot and called all Serbs to join Bakić as the Serbian Despot. Attempts made by King Ferdinand to push the Ottomans out of Slavonia, with the use of Pavle, were not successful. Bakić did not manage to liberate Osijek from the Ottomans, he then retreated to Đakovo, where he at Gorjani, in a battle against the Ottomans, died (1537).

The album \\"The Youth Die Young\\" has received widespread coverage, with generally positive reviews, giving credit to the group for maturing beyond their concert-oriented roots. A review for NPR by Cheryl Waters gives them credit for, as the band members say, \\"stepping up their game\\", balancing hip-hop lyrics over electronic beats. Exposure On July 6, 2010, Spin Magazine named Mad Rad the \\"Best-Kept Seattle Secret\\". In November 2010, Mad Rad was featured on Seattle independent radio station KEXP's Song of the Day blog for their song “The Youth Die Young”.http://blog.kexp.org/blog/2010/11/26/song-of-the-day-mad-rad-–-the- youth-die-young/ Mad Rad has performed at multiple music festivals in the Pacific Northwest including Bumbershoot, Capitol Hill Block Party, and Sasquatch. Controversies Mad Rad was involved in an incident at local Seattle club, Neumos. The incident sent three of the five members of Mad Rad to jail for two nights. They were banned from Neumos in early 2009, but the ban has since been lifted as of early 2010. Their return show to the Neumos, which was a free show, took place on January 21, 2010. The group was also reportedly banned from five other clubs in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood; King Cobra, Havana, The Saint, The War Room and Chop Suey.

The monument, dedicated to the 1996 Summer Olympics, is a gift from the Prince of Wales. The monument is located on Peachtree Street, at Pershing Point, in Midtown Atlanta.  Monument  The statue is carved in Indiana limestone topped by bronze statues, and stands 55 feet tall. It has a conical base circled by five stone bands which have two aedicules on the Peachtree Street axis, within which are plaques honoring the patrons who built the building. Above the base is a tholos circled by five Doric columns, representing the five continents, which support five bronze Atlases who together carry a globe. A cauldron is within the tholos and emits a fire evoking the Olympic torch. Taking advantage of the avenue being straight for a number of blocks, which is unusual in Atlanta, the monument was intentionally aligned with the tower of the 19th-century Gothic Peachtree Christian Church a few blocks away. History The Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture held an international competition for the design of the monument. The competition was won by Anton Glikin, a St. Petersburg, Russia architect and Institute student. The land was donated by the Georgia Department of Transportation. With the lead donation from the Randall family of Atlanta, construction began. The monument was dedicated during the Centennial Olympic Games by Lord Morris of Castle Morris representing Queen Elizabeth II. Impact On August 31, 1997 Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in an automobile accident in Paris. During this time, CNN estimated over 20,000 people were drawn to the World Athletes Monument to grieve and pay their respects. The Atlanta City Council dedicated the space as the Prince of Wales’s Monument at Princess Diana Square. On June 5, 2004, President Ronald Reagan died and once again thousands of people congregated around the World Athletes Monument to grieve. The monument was enshrouded with flags, candles, flowers and other mementos. It has also become a gathering place for sports victories and other civic uses the citizens of Atlanta choose to celebrate.

In the early 1870s, a malt house was constructed next to the original building, along with 4 ice houses on the western side of the avenue in 1872, 1874, 1875, and 1876. In 1878 and 1879, two more ice houses were constructed on the east side of South Park Avenue. A substantial brick barn was built in 1878 and office building was built in 1879.

Douglas, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation profiler and investigative chief, and Mark Olshaker. Profiling is described by Rodger Lyle Brown, author of the book review, as \\"the art and science of looking at the specifics of a crime -- the scene, the facts about the victim, the evidence and the act itself -- and extrapolating a portrait of the culprit's psyche and personal habits.\\" In this book, Douglas explores legendary cases including Lizzie Borden, Jack the Ripper, Black Dahlia, the Charles Lindbergh Jr. kidnapping, the Zodiac Killer, the Boston Strangler, and the Death of JonBenét Ramsey. Douglas and Olshaker explore the cases and how modern techniques that Douglas pioneered might be used to resolve the cases, such as determining motivation for specific acts. Of Jack the Ripper suspects, Douglas states that a paranoid individual such as Aaron Kosminski would likely have openly boasted of the murders while incarcerated had he been the killer, but there is no record that he ever did so. Douglas has asserted that behavioural clues gathered from the murders all point to a person \\"known to the police as David Cohen ... or someone very much like him\\". Nigel Cawthorne, on the other hand, dismissed Cohen as a likely suspect because in the asylum his assaults were undirected, and his behaviour was wild and uncontrolled, whereas the Ripper seemed to attack specifically and quietly. Nigel Cawthore is wholly unreleated to John Douglas or to his book, however. Moreover, Cawthorne's assertion about the Ripper being exclusively quiet and specific is inaccurate. Jack the Ripper often acted carelessly. He tried to decapitate Polly Nichols in the middle of the street, he killed Annie Chapman while trespassing in a private rear yard after sunrise, and he slit Stride's throat while drunk. Cawthorne, Nigel (2000) \\"Foreword\\", in Knight, p. 2 Regarding the case of JonBenét, Douglas contends that John and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter. Of the case, he said: \\"Many crimes are tried in the court of public opinion long before they reach a court of law. But I know of no other case in which the majority of people have decided the solution based on statistics. I know of no other case in which the public substantially believes what has been reported in the tabloids. I know of no other case in which the mainline media have let the tabloids take the lead and then reported on their reporting.

Inaugural Dean of Business and Professor of Economics at Alphacrucis College in Sydney Australia. From 2008-2013 he was Professor of Economics at Australian Catholic University (ACU) where he held a joint appointment in the School of Business and School of Theology. From 2000-2008 Associate Professor of Economics at UNSW/ADFA.  Overview  Paul Oslington is an international expert in the new interdisciplinary field of economics and religion. He has published a series of papers and books exploring the economic dimensions of theological ideas and church practice. His work explores the way Christian theology has shaped the development of economics as a discipline in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially focusing on the role of natural theology. He argues that following from the Christian doctrines of creation and providence, we can learn what we can about God’s character and activity through study of the natural world, including the study of human beings and their economic interactions. Our understanding of the relationship between economics and theology affects Christian ethics, especially the evaluation of markets and questions in business ethics. Oslington has particularly considered the relationship between economics and theology in the writings of Adam Smith, but has also considered John Henry Newman, Max Weber, Jacob Viner and Bernard Lonergan as exemplars of fruitful ways of relating the disciplines. He is also published in the areas of history and philosophy of economics, international trade theory, labour economics, and higher education policy.  Biography  Paul Oslington studied at James Ruse Agricultural High School and Macquarie University before completing a Master of Economics/Econometrics with Honours and PhD in Economics from the University of Sydney and a Bachelor of Divinity and Doctor of Theology from University of Divinity. In addition to his main appointments he spent the 2020 academic year as a Resident Fellow at the Center of Theological Inquiry Princeton, and the 2006/7 academic year as a President’s Visiting Scholar at Princeton Theological Seminary, with additional funding for a project in international economics at Princeton University. He previously held visiting fellowships in the Dept of Economics at University of Oxford in 2000 and University of British Columbia/Regent College Vancouver in 2003.

The WM purchased the C&P; in 1944, and merged the two companies on September 1, 1953. Upon acquisition by the WM, the C&P; was divided in half by the abandonment of the tunnel under Frostburg, Maryland and line through Gramtown (Lower Frostburg) with a total abandonment of 2.6 miles. The portion along Georges Creek continued to be a source of revenue for the WM, until it was acquired by Chessie System in 1973. After the 1987 mergers of Chessie and Seaboard System into CSX, the line began to decline in use, but continues to this day to have occasional trains to the Morrison, Maryland open load-out tipple. On June 21, 2006 Western Maryland Survivors, LLC (WMS) purchased the northern/abandoned 8.54 mile portion of the Georges Creek Subdivision. This portion had two significant washouts that caused CSX to discontinue service north of the Morrison load-out and begin abandonment proceedings. Due to investor difficulties involving WMS, the property was sold during Federal Bankruptcy Court proceedings on February 24, 2011 to one of the WMS original partners, and another partner under the auspices of the Eighteen Thirty Group, LLC.

One of the better-known Assyrian singers, he had since toured Australia, Europe and Asia. The majority of his songs were and are written by his brother, Givergiss Agassi, both in Persian and Assyrian. His first name is generally pronounced Evan by Iranian Assyrians and Ewan by Iraqi and Syrian Assyrians, with an emphasis on the vowels.  Biography  Agassi was born in Kermanshah, Iran. He became involved in the Iranian national radio since his teen years where he recorded a number of records in Persian. He worked with many Iranian poets and composers and produced several popular songs, which were broadcast on the radio and TV stations, with several reaching the top ten records at the time. While in radio, Evin Aghassi also sang Persian songs, which became hits at the time, one noticeable song dates back to 1974 entitled SHAHRZAAD which was loved by many Iranians and Assyrians all over the world. In 1976, Agassi was invited to the United States for some concerts in California and Chicago, which became a success. After returning to Iran, he produced songs based upon his pleasant experience in the United States. Courageously, Agassi made a few social political songs, forgetting the strong censorship in Iran. These songs, which were about humanity, equality, and freedom, were ultimately collected by the Iranian government and banned. Due to these distressing outcomes and also because of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Agassi relocated to the United States in the late 1970s for the social and political freedom there. Meanwhile, the Iraqi government was also rather vehement towards his songs, as they emboldened the Assyrians of Iraq, who opted for peace, freedom and human rights. As such, a few of Agassi's songs were banned there and his name was registered on a blacklist by Saddam Hussein. To this day, he gives concerts regularly in the United States, Europe and Australia. In 2010, he's travelled to Syria, and in 2016 he has visited Iraqi Kurdistan, to perform at the concerts and parties there. His recent album \\"The Circle Of Life\\", released in 2012, has been one of his most anticipated albums, after his 7-year hiatus.

She was requisitioned by the Royal Australia Navy in June 1940 during the Second World War for conversion to a minesweeper and anti-submarine vessel and was commissioned on 22 September 1940 as HMAS Yandra. She returned to civilian service in 1946. She ran aground during dense fog onto South Neptune Island on 25 January 1959 and was subsequently written off. Service in South Australia The Yandra was built for Coast Steamships Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Adelaide Steamship Company, by Burmeister and Wain, Copenhagen. She arrived in Port Adelaide from London on Tuesday, 23 October 1928 and commenced service in early November 1928. She was specifically designed for serving regional ports on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula – a locality commonly known as the 'west coast' in South Australia. Her relatively shallow draft allowed access to ports at destinations such as Elliston and Venus Bay. Military Service Photos by Capt. Geoff Rickards, 1st Officer Yandra 1956–1959' The Yandra was requisitioned from Coast Steamships Ltd. on 27 June 1940. She was converted for anti-submarine warfare in Sydney and then commissioned in the Royal Australian Navy on 22 September 1940. HMAS Yandra challenged a ship off Rottnest Island, Western Australia on 5 October 1941 during the night and was given a false name Salland, from Calcutta. The ship never appeared in port as expected and caused naval intelligence some concern that this vessel could have been the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran, it was dismissed as a misreading of the morse code. HMAS Yandra picked up 72 German survivors of the Kormoran on 27 November 1941, while searching for . Transferred to Sydney, HMAS Yandra was patrolling off the harbour boom gate on 31 May 1942, when a Japanese midget submarine (later identified as M-27) got entangled in the boom net. She later sighted a midget submarine (later identified as M-21) in the Harbour. HMAS Yandra and dropped depth charges over the site, with HMAS Yandra ramming the midget submarine on the bows. Unfortunately, both HMAS Yandra and HMAS Sea Mist were disabled by their own depth charges. After being repaired, HMAS Yandra patrolled on both the Australian east and west coasts, and New Guinea. She was returned to her owner in 1946 and resumed service to 'west coast' ports on 20 July 1946. Fate Yandra ran aground during dense fog on the northern island in the South Neptune Island group at the mouth of Spencer Gulf at about 10 pm on Saturday, 25 January 1959 about 400 metres (1300 ft) from the lighthouse located on the nearby southern island. The decision to abandon ship was advised by radio at 11.10 pm. The crew abandoned the ship using a breeches buoy and all 23 crew had safely evacuated to the northern island by 11.45 pm where they spent the night in the open. At dawn, the fog started to clear and the grounded ship was sighted by the lighthouse keepers who had been unaware of the grounding due to difficulties with radio transmission. The yacht Iline, a competitor in the annual Neptune Island yacht race conducted by the Royal South Australian Yacht Squadron, answered a radio call at 3.30 am and proceeded to the wreck site where it assisted in ferrying to the crew to the lighthouse complex on the southern island. The tug Tusker was dispatched from Port Adelaide on 26 January 1959 to assess the damage. It was decided that Yandra could not be recovered and Tusker returned to Port Adelaide with the rescued crew.Christopher, P.; (1990), South Australian Shipwrecks: A Database (1802–1989), Society for Underwater Historical Research, North Adelaide, SA, pp 180 & 181\\\\.

There are five Books of Elsewhere: # The Shadows (2010) # Spellbound (2011) # The Second Spy (2012) # The Strangers (2013) # Still Life (2014)  Plot summary  = The Shadows = = Spellbound = Olive, the main character, is worried. After breaking the McMartins' enchanted spectacles in the first book, The Shadows, Olive has no way to get her friend Morton out of Elsewhere, the world in the McMartins' enchanted paintings. The house's three guardian cats, Horatio, Harvey, and Leopold, have been no help in this task. Harvey hasn't been seen for two days. When Olive finds Harvey, he is watching the kid next door, Rutherford Dewey, getting scolded by his grandmother. The next day, Rutherford confronts Olive about his missing models, which Harvey took. After an exchange, Harvey scolds Olive for being friendly with Rutherford, which Harvey calls a \\"spy\\". Rutherford mentions something about a spellbook, and Olive is determined to find it. Olive searches the library for a spellbook, but in reality, the spellbook is trying to find Olive, and plays tricks on Olive's brain while she sleeps. After a long search, Olive stumbles upon the spellbook, which is held in clasping hands. Olive takes it out, and is amazed by what it says. The cats sense that Olive is being controlled by the spellbook, and try to snap Olive out of it, but fails. Olive realizes that she is being controlled at Mrs. Dewey's (Rutherford's grandmother) house. Olive finally is snapped out of it, and tries to deal with the spellbook, but Annabelle escapes and will wreak havoc in later books. = The Second Spy = Olive, the protagonist, is scared of Annabelle (the main antagonist). Having (accidentally) freed her in Spellbound, Olive is starting to believe that death waits around every corner. At the first day of junior high, Olive is embarrassed. But Olive falls through a hole in her backyard, into a room with all sorts of magical substances. Meanwhile Morton, who is still stuck in Elsewhere, is growing more desperate and tries to get out. Olive makes a deal with Morton: Morton will stay in Elsewhere for three months. If Olive hasn't found his parents by that time, Morton can get out. Annabelle leaves Olive notes, noting in one that \\"your own friend is hiding a secret from you.\\" Rutherford says he will be going to a private school in Sweden. Olive feels that Rutherford betrayed her. Olive has an idea for Morton: If she creates a magical painting of Morton's parents, Morton might actually find his parents! But it goes all wrong, and Olive is banished downstairs by Horatio, who is quite angry at her. Later that night, Olive finds Horatio, but feels compelled to hide from him. Olive is a little confused by the incident. In the attic, Olive stumbles on a portrait of Aldous McMartin, but after a fierce confrontation with Aldous, is distracted and lets the portrait slip into Annabelle's hands. Later, she realizes that there is a painted Horatio, who is an imposter. The two Horatios fight, with the real one getting scratched and scraped and the painted one getting without a hitch. But the fake Horatio gets dunked into the a bathtub full of \\"everything at once\\", and is dissolved. The book ends with Harvey saying \\"We may not have to fight alone,\\" and Rutherford making a confession about being a mind reader. = The Strangers = It's Halloween night when strangers come to Linden Street . . . and something absolutely vital to Olive goes missing. To what lengths will she go to get it back? Can she trust the strangers? Will she turn to a new and dangerous magic within the paintings of Elsewhere? Or will Olive put her faith in her own worst enemies to save the people and home she loves? The stakes grow higher, the secrets more dangerous, and mystery and magic abound as Olive, the boys, and the magical cats uncover the true nature of the old stone house on Linden Street. = Still Life = Annabelle McMartin is gone for good, but something worse lurks just out of sight--watching, waiting, preparing to strike. Then a field trip to the local art museum reveals a shock. What Olive discovers will create a chain of events that propel her to discoveries she may not wish to uncover, involving Morton's vanished parents and the very deepest, darkest roots of Aldous McMartin's creepy painted world. In this fifth and final book, Olive must seek the full, complex story of Elsewhere, its magical origins, and its creator, and in so doing, face her own fears and limitations--and possibly the destruction of Elsewhere itself. How far will Olive go to save the people and home she loves? And what will be the final cost?  Characters  * Olive Dunwoody — Olive Dunwoody is the main character of the book series. Her parents are math experts, yet Olive is not very good at math. She moves into the house on Linden Street.

The school was founded in 2000 by Teresa Richman and Ben Frankel. The middle school was added in September 2006 and in 2007 the board approved the inclusion of a high school programme that began in 2008/9 academic year. HKA graduated its first IB Diploma cohort in May 2012.  Curriculum  = Early childhood = The Hong Kong Academy Early Childhood program consists of grades Pre-K1-G1. Students study four International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Programme (PYP) units of inquiry, integrating Art, Music, Physical Education and Mandarin. Throughout primary school the classes have a lead teacher and a co-teacher in every classroom. In Pre- Kindergarten the co-teacher is a qualified Mandarin language teacher. = Primary school = HKA was accredited for the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme in 2004. The school chose the PYP intentionally because the curriculum provides a flexible framework which connects the school to a global community whilst allowing the inclusion of locally relevant content. The PYP's transdisciplinary approach to learning promotes creative questioning and meaningful exploration of themes and focuses on personal development. Using “Units of Inquiry”, students develop core competencies in mathematics and language arts within and across themes in a context that promotes learning for understanding. The primary school is led by a principal, an assistant principal and PYP coordinator, and a counsellor. For students receiving learner support, the Learner Support Team works closely with teachers and with the primary school leadership. = Secondary school = Students in grades 6-10 follow the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme. The full full IB Diploma Programme is available to grade 11 and 12 students. = Diploma Options = Students at HKA are given the opportunity to qualify for the HKA Diploma and/or a mix of Diploma Certificates or the full IB Diploma. Qualification for the HKA High School Diploma is determined by credits awarded in the final four years of school.  Option 1: HKA Diploma  Students must earn 26 credits over four years (Grades 9-12) in order to obtain their HKA Diploma. A credit is earned by earning a year-end mark of 3 (out of a possible 7) or higher.  Option 2: HKA Diploma and the IB DP  Students that choose to pursue the IB DP must complete all of the requirements of the IB DP during Grades 11 and 12. This includes scoring a minimum of 24 points on their 6 IB exams, and successful completion of the extended essay, CAS, and the Theory of Knowledge. Students successful in this option will have earned BOTH the HKA Diploma and IB DP. Option 3: HKA Diploma and IB Certificates Students that do not choose the IB DP will sit for external IB examinations in May of their grade 12 year in SOME IB classes and SOME HKA classes. They will earn IB certificates for subjects in which they sit for the IB examination. =Learner support= Children needing learning support are admitted upon the same criteria as other students. They must be able to succeed in the mainstream classroom with support services. HKA learning support includes children with special educational needs and physical disabilities as well as those performing beyond grade level expectations. Campus The campus was located in Wan Chai and Kennedy Town. In August 2013 the school moved to its new permanent site in Sai Kung.  2019 college admissions bribery scandal  A New York Times report connected Hong Kong Academy to the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. The Times reports that Gamal Abdelaziz’s daughter was portrayed as a standout basketball player at Hong Kong Academy. A coach at the University of Southern California named Laura Janke created a profile of a girl who starred for a Hong Kong Academy's basketball team, earning such awards as “Asia Pacific Activities Conference All-Star Team,” “2016 China Cup Champions,” “Hong Kong Academy team M.V.P.,” and “team captain”. Hong Kong Academy does not play in either of these leagues and does not have MVP awards. Players of the 2018 Hong Kong Academy basketball team say Abdelaziz’s daughter never attended the school, let alone led the basketball team. The Times does not implicate or accuse Hong Kong Academy or any of its staff of falsifying records and there is no record of this student having attended the school.

History In 1845, the earliest systematic exploration of India’s coal resources was initiated by D.H.Williams, Geological Surveyor of the East India Company. In 1924, Dr. Cyril Fox surveyed once again certain coal-bearing areas, including the Pench, Kanhan and Tawa Valleys.Anubhuti Ranjan Prasad, Coal Industry of India, p. 65, Asish Publishing House, 8/81 Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi 110026, The collieries in Pench Kanhan Coalfield were owned by several companies and owners such as Amalgamated Coalfields Limited, Pench Valley Coal Company, N.H.Ojha & Co., J.A.Trivedi Brothers, Newton Chikli Collieries (Private) Ltd., S.C.Kambata (Pvt) Ltd., Oriental Coal Co. Ltd., Sial Ghogri Group and The Jamai Majri Coal Co. Ltd. These were nationalized in 1973. The coalfield Satpura Coalfields are located in northern Chhindwara and Betul Districts, south of the Narmada. Three rivers flow through the area - Pench, Kanhan and Tawa. There are four coalfields in these valleys – Pench Kanhan Valley Coalfield, Mohpani Coalfield, Tawa Valley Coalfield and Pathakhera Coalfield. Outside the Damodar Valley, Satpura Gondwana Basin is the only area where coking coal is found in India.Shri Kamal Sharma, Spatial Framework and Economic Development, Northern Book Centre, 4221/1 Daryaganj, Ansari Road, New Delhi 110 002, 2000, p. 159, The Pench Kanhan Valley Coalfield is situated to the northwest of Chhindwara. While Pench Valley has five seams in a column of 50-80 m thickness, the coal belt in the Kanhan valley stretches for about . In the Pench valley, except for seam no I, the other seams occur in patches. Important collieries in the Pench valley are: Newton, Chikli, Borkuhi, Ramanwara, Eklahera, Bamori, North Chandameta, Chandameta, East Dongar Chikli, Ambara Sukri, Datla and Shivpuri. Important coalfields in the Kanhan valley are: Rakhikhol, Danwa, Kalichappar and Nandan. There is a virgin area to the north. According to the Geological Survey of India, total reserves of coal (including proven, indicated and inferred) in the Pench Kanhan Coalfield is 2,411.28 million tonnes. Out this 657.39 million tonnes is medium coking coal, of which 347.06 million tonnes is available up to a depth of 300 m and another 310.33 million tonnes between 300 and 600 m.

This is a poet with absolutely no reliance on madness or on romantic mismatch between himself and the world, and he should, at the very least, be able to keep doing what he's doing as impressively as he has been doing it, which is awfully impressively.\\" Adam Kirsch, writing for The New York Sun, called Mehigan's work \\"Frost-like in the way he plays speech rhythms against the patterns of verse, creating a tense, deceptively simple music. . . . \\" and adds that \\"Mr. Mehigan also has something of Frost's delight in darkness; many of his poems offer the uncomfortable surprise that Poe called the most important element of poetry.\\"  Awards and recognition  * Levinson Prize from Poetry Magazine * NEA (National Endowment for the Arts) Literature Fellowship winner, 2011 * Editors Choice Award for best feature article from Poetry Magazine for \\"I Thought You Were a Poet: A Notebook\\" an essay exploring the connections between madness and Poetry, 2011. * Op-ed Contributor, \\"The Polling Place,\\" a poem, published as part of an Election Day feature, \\"The Measure of Democracy.\\" The New York Times, 2008. * Pushcart Prize, 2005 * Los Angeles Times Book Prize Finalist, 2005. * Mehigan profiled in the City Section of The New York Times, \\"Finding the Verse in Adversity,\\" 2005 * The Optimist selected as a Big Ten University Press Pick, by ForeWord, 2005. * Hollis Summer Summers Poetry Prize, 2004 * Dogwood Poetry Prize, 2004.

He became a leader of the Zionist youth group Blau-Weiss (Blue and White) in Munich. He achieved a degree in economics at the University of Frankfurt, and briefly worked for the newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung. In 1926, he married Margot Klausner in Berlin, and they spent six months on honeymoon in Eretz Israel.

Rosner developed a style which was a cross of sorts between documentary and staged photography. The subjects in these photographs were always handsome, strong, happy, and hard-working. When reality was incongruent with the expectations, it was staged in a pseudo-documentary fashion.

During her working experience in Al Arabiya, Mayssoun anchored for three years a two-hours, weekly talk show, Mashahed wa Ara’ (مشاهد وآراء). She also interviewed high-profile guests, such as Mahmoud Abbas, Bill Gates, Tony Blair, and Salam Fayyad. In addition, she reported from the embattled West Bank in Palestine where she was embedded with international activists who were helping Palestinian farmers harvest their olives and protecting from the hostilities of the Jewish settlers. Al Arabiya was the media sponsor for the Palestinian first investment conference held in Bethlehem, and she was chosen to MC the inauguration which included keynote speakers like President Mahmoud Abbas among others. Believing in the importance of supporting woman in all fields, she produced eleven episodes about the obstacles facing pregnant women at work. She broke the classic image of Arab news presenters and shared the ups and downs she went through as a working pregnant presenter. Mayssoun was appointed as the Ambassador of Nescafe Red Mug (2010/11) to highlight health benefits of coffee and to address the myths surrounding habitual coffee drinking. In addition to her work at Al Arabiya, Mayssoun Azzam taught communication at the American University in Dubai. Early life Mayssoun Azzam was born in Abu Dhabi, UAE to a Palestinian family. Her parents, Nawaf Azzam and Isaaf El-Youssef, fled Palestine to Lebanon in 1948. Her father graduated from the Beirut Arab University with a law degree.

Tasaka Guri-Guri is very protective of the recipe and has kept it a family secret for decades. History Jokichi Tasaka first made guri-guri in the early 1900s while living in Japan. Jokichi called the dessert goodie-goodie, as in something \\"good\\" to eat. His son Gunji Tasaka came to realize that it was difficult for the older Japanese people to pronounce the name, so he began to call it guri-guri. Gunji Tasaka later migrated to the United States and continued to run the family business. Tasaka Guri-Guri has operated for over 100 years but has relocated several times. The Tasaka family's business started with a store on Pu'unene Avenue in Kahului, Maui. The Tasaka family relocated from that store to one in Wailuku, where they stayed for about 1 year. Tasaka and family then moved to The Old Kahului Shopping Center in Kahului where they stayed for many years. They have been located in Maui Mall in Kahului, since 1973.

Taxonomy Araneus mitificus belongs to the genus Araneus. It is classified under the subfamily Araneinae of the orb-weaver spider family Araneidae. They are members of the superfamily of eight-eyed spiders Araneoidea of the suborder Araneomorphae. The species was originally described in 1886 as Epeira mitifica by the French arachnologist Eugène Simon. Description Araneus mitificus climbing up a gloved human hand in Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan Araneus mitificus are small spiders and exhibit sexual dimorphism. The females grow up to . Males are smaller, reaching only , and are generally less colorful than the females. Their abdomens are globular and covered with fine hair. They slope abruptly from the mid-region to the posterior. Two small but distinct tubercles are present at the rear end. The dorsal surface is covered with white and black patterns that can vary considerably. The front edge usually has a wide black band. In the upper center is a characteristic large kidney-shaped marking (which can sometimes be a faint vertical line or V-shaped), from which it derives its common name. Immediately below it are two small but prominent black pits (fovea). At the posterior half is a series of faint transverse ridges. The markings on the back of the spider can resemble a human face if viewed from the front. The ventral side of the abdomen is a uniform green. The epigynes of the females have unwrinkled, very short and thick scapes. The cephalothorax is reddish, yellowish, or green in color. It is narrower at the front than at the back and also covered with fine pubescence. The sternum is heart-shaped, narrowing towards the back. It is covered with long, black, spine-like hairs. They have eight eyes arranged in two recurved rows. The front row of eyes are larger and more recurved than the back row. Dark rings encircle the pair of central back eyes and the lateral eyes are close together and mounted on black tubercles. The labium is wider than it is long and yellowish. The maxillae have almost square shapes and have distinct tufts of hair at the tips (scopulae). The chelicerae and pedipalps are also yellowish to brownish in color. The legs are moderately strong and long. They are reddish, yellowish, pale green, to brownish in color. The distal ends of the leg segments have transverse bands dark brown in color. They are covered with long black spines and fine hairs. Its leg formula is 1-2-4-3, with the first pair the longest, and the third pair the shortest. Distribution and habitat Araneus mitificus resting in its sanctuary in Chūō-ku, Kobe, Japan. Note the missing segment on its web. Araneus mitificus are found in South, East, and Southeast Asia; west from Pakistan and India, north towards China and Japan, and south towards the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Australia. They are common in gardens and low vegetation. They often build their webs among bushes. Behavior Araneus mitificus builds orb webs that are characteristically missing a section. The spider does not rest on the center of the web, but instead builds a silk-lined sanctuary in a leaf at the margins. The leaf is bent at the edges and roofed with a mesh of silk. If a prey animal becomes entangled in the web, the vibrations from its struggle travel to the center of the web, then along a single long strand of silk (the signal line) positioned in the empty section. The strand is linked to the hidden spider. Once the spider feels the signal line vibrate, it will rush out to capture the prey. Males also build orb webs, often near the webs of females. Their webs are usually smaller. See also *Zygiella x-notata *Araneus quadratus *Araneus diadematus *List of Araneidae species'' *Orb-weaver spider References Further reading *Simon, E. 1886.

On 24 February, Telangana political JAC organised Egypt-like mass protests in Hyderabad beginning 10 March. Projections for number of people to be mobilised varied from one to five million. Protesters raised slogans of 'Jai Telangana', sang pro-Telangana songs, and played games. Protesters included activists of various political parties, students, government employees, lawyers, doctors, teachers, journalists, writers and cultural artists. 48 people were arrested for the vandalism of the statues. A Telangana leader said the incident show the hatred towards leaders of Andhra and he fears more such incidents if the central government further delays the process to carve out separate Telangana state.

Non-cooperation movement The Telangana political JAC declared the launch of a non-cooperation movement throughout Telangana, including the state capital at Hyderabad, starting on 17 February. The plan was to request government employees not to work; people not to pay taxes or utility bills; people not to buy tickets while using public transport; to organise rallies; to block traffic on highways; and other measures. Around 200,000 government employees in Telangana participated by boycotting work and holding rallies or playing sports at the workplace while TRS MLAs travelled ticket-less in local trains. The Telangana JAC called for the shutdown of all services, except emergency services, in Telangana on 22 and 23 February. Educational institutions, private and public offices, commercial establishments, industrial areas, private and public transport, and outpatient services in hospitals were closed as unions, organisations, and individuals actively participated in the strike by having rallies, hunger strikes, community meals on roads, and other protests. The strike was mostly peaceful barring a few incidents. The state government continued to lose Rs 8 billion per day in revenue due to the non-cooperation movement. =Protests in Assembly= Legislative Assembly proceedings were disrupted by Telangana legislators on the first day of the budget session, as the Governor's address to the assembly did not include the Telangana issue. 22 MLAs and six MLCs from Congress boycotted the first day of the Assembly session. Telangana proponents have criticised the alleged anti-Telangana behaviour of Governor E. S. L. Narasimhan. TRS MLAs had heated arguments and gheraoed Lok Satta MLA Jayaprakash Narayan who had condemned the attack on the governor. One of them, K Vidyasagar Rao assaulted him first, followed by blows by the driver of another TRS MLA E Rajender who justified the attack. TRS later denied they attacked him but questioned his respect for Telangana sentiments. On 18 February five MLAs were suspended for unruly behaviour and for manhandling the governor. Deputy Speaker N Manohar termed this as shameful for democracy. =Incidents of violence= In the first two days of the non-cooperation movement, the government lost 15 billion in revenue. On 19 February, Telangana protesters burnt down five buses and set fire to police tents in and around the Osmania University campus. On 21 February a march of Telangana students and lawyers to Assembly turned violent when they were blocked by security forces. The police commissioner warned television channels against telecasting violence. Telangana cable operators blocked out TV news channels owned by Seema-Andhra industrialists citing their alleged 'anti-Telangana' stand. TRS leaders and activists attacked APTransco billing counters in Karimnagar town and pulled down tent of CPI(M) activists who were protesting on civic issues at the municipal office in Warangal. On 22 February, at Ellapur railway station in Hasanparty mandal, trains were stranded for an hour after pro- Telangana agitators removed hook locks from the rail tracks. Pro-Telangana activists halted the Delhi-bound AP Express at Kazipet railway station for 15 minutes on the same day. Before the train reached Kazipet, a few students rained stones on the AP Express at Ellapur in Hasanparty mandal.

Three buses of a private engineering college parked near Habsiguda were set ablaze by suspected Telangana activists on 24 February. On 2 March, Pro-Telangana activists disrupted a film shooting by burning down the set. Telangana universities, especially Osmania University, have had a heavy police presence since December 2009. Telangana political JAC chairman Professor Kodandaram alleged that police from Seema-Andhra region were very brutal towards Telangana students. The refusal of the police to allow students to organise rallies provoked pitched battles between police and students, and arrests of students, which leads to more protests. Police behaviour was criticised by human rights activists and by the High Court. On 21 February students hurled stones at the security personnel at Adikmet and Nizam College hostel at Basheerbagh area, forcing the police to use tear gas shells to disperse them. Policemen reported that Osmania University students protesting for Telangana have used petrol bombs to target police personnel on duty at the campus.http://newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/article400646.ece Suicides continue to be a form of protests by Telanganites, despite appeals by various leaders, parties, and organizations to stop. =Protests in Parliament= Telangana parliament members belonging to the ruling party protested in Parliament on 22 February for Telangana not being mentioned in the government agenda.

Twelve Telangana MLAs were suspended on 23 February; On 24 February, fifteen members of the ruling party from Telangana joined the protests. Sushma Swaraj, leader of the opposition in Parliament (Lok Sabha) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, said \\"it was rare that eleven members from the ruling Congress wanted a discussion and they were being silenced. The Telangana issue can be resolved immediately if the Prime Minister simply announces in the House that a Bill supporting the creation of Telangana would be brought in this session itself. I promise you that our party, BJP and our allies will support such bill.\\" Asaduddin Owaisi, president of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, remarked that his party will not allow or want Hyderabad to be made a Union Territory. He said that if Telangana is created, then Hyderabad has to be a part of it.

Their plans included rallies over the weekend, a rail blockade on 1 March, and Egypt-like mass protests in Hyderabad. They hoped to mobilise five million people from throughout Telangana in the second week of March. The police department is one of the departments which is not participating the non- cooperation movement. Employees of the office of the Medak district police superintendent joined the movement. The state police chief clarified that the protesting employees were office staff, not policemen. There are reports that policemen are contemplating joining the agitation.Police officer's staff joins Telangana protests On 1 March a train blockade by pro-Telangana protesters, with a theme of \\"villages on railway tracks\\", paralysed train services throughout Telangana. Protestors cooked and played sports; and students held essay competitions on the railway tracks. Travel was difficult because the railways are the primary mode of transportation in India for long-distance travellers. 99 out of 119 legislators from Telangana, including those from ruling party, boycotted Assembly proceedings. Of remaining the legislators, 16 are ministers. BJP, CPI, and MIM legislators remained in the house. On 3 March Parliament proceedings were disrupted whole day due to protests by Telangana MPs with the support of BJP members. =Strike call-off= On 4 March, Congress MPs from Telangana who were requested by party incharges to wait appeared in the Lok Sabha with black bands around their mouths to indicate that there was a gag order by their party leadership. Their refusal to remove those black bands caused the speaker to adjourn the house. On 3 March Telangana employees said they will not call off their agitation unless there is a firm assurance from the centre on formation of separate Telangana state. The next day, the state government gave a written assurance to employees to press the centre for deletion of clause 14 (f) from the Presidential Order, removing free zone status to Hyderabad, and set up judicial commission to ensure strict enforcement of GO 610. The state gave assurances that employees will be permitted a delegation to the Prime Minister to request the division of the state. Employees union said they will resume the non-cooperation movement after students exams are over in April. after the Congress party's central leadership reportedly told Telangana MPs that it will take a decision on Telangana after assembly elections in several states in May. Congress legislators from Telangana ended their boycott on 14 March, citing their responsibility to see the state budget passed. Million March 2011 = Preparations = On 24 February, TJAC announced that it will organise Egypt- like mass protests in Hyderabad beginning 10 March. Projections for number of people to be mobilised varied from one to five million. Some parents' associations and teachers appealed to the JAC to postpone the protest as the gathering of a \\"million\\" people might cause inconvenience to the students appearing for the ongoing Class X, XII and CBSE exams. Three days before the proposed march, the JAC chairman said that the march would not be on the scale on which it was originally planned, which included \\"laying siege\\" to Hyderabad, and the march would start in the afternoon instead of morning, in view of final exams to students in the morning. Police issued prohibitory orders to prevent gatherings and set up check-posts at the district borders of Hyderabad, as no permission had been granted for the march. Police took a large number of activists into preventive custody including the Osmania University JAC president and put up barricades in all nine Telangana districts and on the outskirts of Hyderabad to prevent activists joining the protest. TJAC chairman M. Kodandaram alleged that police arrested 100,000 people including 11,000 in Hyderabad; he asked, \\"People can protest in Egypt and Tunisia but not in Hyderabad?\\" He said the march needed no permission as it would be peaceful. South Central Railway (SCR) cancelled four express trains and 43 passenger trains connecting various districts of Telangana with Hyderabad. Multi-Modal Transport System (MMTS) train service was suspended on three out of four routes in the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad and the outskirts. = Day of the demonstration = On the day of the march, over 12,000 personnel from police and central paramilitary forces were deployed in the city. Traffic was diverted by police and no one was allowed to areas close to Tank Bund, the secretariat, Raj Bhavan, and the assembly. Students clashed with police when they were locked inside the Osmania University to prevent them from taking out a rally to Tank Bund. Police fired teargas shells to control the students. Several pro-Telangana leaders, including 50 MLAs belonging to the BJP, CPI, Muslim League, TRS, TDP, and Jamat-e-Islami parties and JAC convenor Kodandaram, were arrested as soon as they started their rally. The police arrested people coming to Tank Bund area until 1 pm. After 1 pm the activists started reaching Tank Bund in groups from different directions and outnumbered the police. The protestors uprooted barricades put up on both ends of the road, and by 3 pm thousands of protestors were gathered. Telangana agitators pretended to perform 'marriages' in the Arya Samaj building to slip into the Lower Tank Bund. BJP leader and Doctor J Bapu Reddy, along with four of his followers, travelled in an ambulance from Nizamabad to Hyderabad through the checkpoints to attend the march by informing the police that a \\"seriously ill patient\\" was being taken to hospital in Hyderabad. Protestors raised slogans of 'Jai Telangana', sang pro- Telangana songs, and played games. Protestors included activists of various political parties, students, government employees, lawyers, doctors, teachers, journalists, writers and cultural artists. Telangana activists attacked pro- Telangana Congress MPs Madhu Yaskhi Goud and K. Keshava Rao by throwing slippers & water bottles citing their failure to resign in support of the separate statehood agitation. While the police estimated 20,000 people participated in the march, the JAC estimate was 100,000. The BBC reported a turnout of 50,000. At around 3:15 a student of Osmania university attempted suicide by consuming poison on Tank bund road, saying \\"Jai Telangana\\". His suicide letter said, \\"In spite of voting for them (public representatives), they could not succeed in achieving separate statehood for Telangana and my suicide is a reminder for them that people are willing to die for Telangana.\\". Doctors confirmed that his situation is improving. Later protesters demanded that the police release all the leaders they arrested and bring them to Tank bund.Telangana March: Warzone Several patients in critical condition were locked out of the emergency ward of the Gandhi hospital for over two hours from 2.30 pm, following a flash strike by the doctors demanding the release of their colleagues who had been arrested by the police. Around 4 pm, after KCR and Kondaram arrived at Tank bund, all the participants in the rally vowed to fight for formation of Telangana state by saying a pledge. = Destruction of statues = Pro-Telangana activists damaged 16 statues representing Telugu culture language on Tank Bund. They threw some of the remnants into the lake. The agitators used iron rods and ropes from the barricades put up by the police to uproot the statues.Pent-up anger led to vandalism The agitators did not touch the statues of Nizam VI Mir Mahaboob Ali Khan. These statues were installed by state government in 1986. The protests were reportedly designed to deepen linguistic and political divides between pro-Telangana and Pro- United State groups. The police say the attack was pre-planned. Three TRS activists who in the early hours of 10 March burnt the statue of 'Telangana Talli' in Medak district were arrested. The TRS MLA and son of Mr Chandrasekhar Rao, Mr K.T. Rama Rao (KTR), had said earlier that they would damage the statues on Tank Bund as most of them, according to him, were of people from the Coastal Andhra/Rayalaseema region. KTR in a speech in October 2010 gave an ultimatum to the government to install a statue of Komaram Bheem, Telangana freedom fighter, on the Tank Bund or else the existing statues would not be allowed to remain. Telangana proponents alleged that the Coastal- Andhra/Rayalaseema ruling class installed those statues intentionally ignoring prominent personalities from Telangana. Agitators set a police vehicle on fire and attacked a vehicle and crew of a TV channel broadcasting the mayhem Nearly 30 video cameras and six photo cameras belonging to six different TV channels were snatched, damaged, or thrown in the water. Many media persons were manhandled and some of them were injured. The protestors looted and set on fire an ATM of Andhra Bank, a government office, and damaged the windows of a hotel. The Chief Minister, Mr N. Kiran Kumar Reddy, had instructed the police to refrain from firing, fearing preventable deaths and consequent stirring up of emotions even further. Some Telangana leaders in the rally tried to stop the destruction of the statues and attacks on the media. It was also alleged that none of the leaders including Mr Chandrasekhar Rao, Gaddar or the BJP leader, Mr Bandaru Dattatreya, who were present at Tank Bund tried to stop the mob. Around 6 pm, the protestors began to leave the venue and by 6:30 the whole area became calm.Telangana March: details = Reactions = Top leaders of all political parties in the state condemned the vandalism. \\"At least now the government should install the statues of Telangana figures at the Tank Bund\\", it said. Kodandaram, who visited Tank Bund in the evening after he was released by police, claimed that the march was a huge success. He demanded the immediate release of all Telangana activists and leaders. He regretted the damage to the statues and the attacks on the media and said that such vandalism was against Telangana culture. He suspected plain cloths policemen could be involved in the vandalism. 48 people were arrested for the vandalism of the statues. A Telangana leader said the incident showed the hatred towards Andhra people for their industrial might which did not give enough space for them to open industries and compete and he feared more such incidents if the central government further delays the process to carve out separate Telangana state. The police came to the conclusion that the TRS, IFTU, CPI-ML New Democracy, Osmania University students, and the TRSV were behind the violence. Telugu scholars, poets, political leaders, and local residents mourned and offered homage to the statues destroyed in what was termed Talibanic way. Kamalakara Swamy of Hindu Devalaya Parirakshana Samiti said, \\"These statues of saints like Annamacharya are like temples for us. How is the 500-year-old Srikrishna Devaraya statue concerned with the Telangana movement!”(Statue is 25 years old. Srikrishna Devaraya lived 500 years back) The Maharashtra Telugu Manch (MTM) president said, \\"The destruction of statues on the Tank bund has hurt sentiments of all the Telugus. It is definitely sending wrong signals about the Telangana movement\\". Protesting the destruction of statues, people organised a 'padayatra'(a form of protest rally) on the Tank Bund Road and offered homage to the great personalities seeking apologies for the disrespect heaped on them. \\"They (Telangana supporters) can secure statehood. We have nothing against it. But this desecration of statues is totally unjustified. These great personalities are not confined to any region\\", Garikapati Narasimha Rao, a famous Telugu scholar said. \\"Even if 10 lakh bulls marched on the Tank Bund road, they would not have caused any harm to the statues\\", Jonnavithula Ramalingeswara Rao, a poet remarked. President of Telangana Jagruti (the cultural wing of TRS) and daughter of K Chandrasekhar Rao, Kavita, in a Telangana \\"self-respect\\" rally warned the government against re- installing the demolished statues without installing the statues of Telangana personalities. She threatened that her activists will demolish the statues again if they were reinstalled before the creation of Telangana state. Kodandram said he does not think the destruction was an act against the contributions of those figures. He said that the protestors were angry with the police for creating obstructions to the march and they directed their anger at the statues, which represented the Seema-Andhra. He denied any conspiracy to destroy the statues. Osmania University students warned non- Telangana staff of the university to not pass on the identities of agitators to the police and warned them they could become targets if they did not join the agitation.

It is located next to Copenhagen Central Station in front of the Meat District. The oblong square eventually turns into Sønder Boulevard, a broad street with a park strip in its central reserve, which continues to Enghavevej at Enghave station. History Galmtorvet - when it was still called Ny Stormgade - seen on a map detail from the 1890s Copenhagen's haymarket was originally located just inside the Western City Gate where the City Hall Square lies today. It closed on 1 January 1888 and relocated to the area outside the new Livestock Market which had opened at the site in 1879. Market days were Wednesday and Saturday and up to several hundred loads of hay and straw were traded and distributed to cattle and horse stables around the city. Halmtorvet, c. 1910 Up through the 20th century, with improved infrastructure, livestock moved out of the city and horses lost their role in transportation, and the haymarket finally closed. The area fell into despair and became associated with prostitution and drug dealing. The site was also dominated by through traffic, buses and goods transport. The area underwent gradual gentrification up through the 1990s and Halmtorvet was thoroughly refurbished from 1999 to 2003 as part of a major programme for urban renewal in the Vesterbro area. The first stage was designed by the office of the City Architect and completed in 2000. The second and third stages were designed by the Park Office of the City and carried out in 2003. In order to obtain a coherent space in the area a large gas regulator in front of the Brown Meat District was removed. Square layout The square has an oblong shape. To make the space more attractive to urban life, the new layout introduced one- way traffic which is taken along a single lane on the south side of the square. A roundabout on the corner of the Brown Meat District, distributes traffic south and north of the Central Station. In the centre of the square, in front of Øksnehallen, there is an oval pool surrounded by large open spaces and playgrounds. Other areas have elevated lawns and flower beds with terraced sides. Other elements in the refurbishment include new paving and items of street furniture. Buildings Emil Blichfeldt's building from 1898 The north side of the square is lined with residential buildings from the 1890s. The building between Lille Istedgade and Abel Cathrine Gade was built from 1897 to 1898 to the design of Emil Blichfeldt who has also designed the main entrance of Tivoli Gardens on the other side of the Central Station. No 11: The main entrance to Øksnehallen Built in 1961, Borgenhus, at No. 20, is the only building in Inner Vesterbro under City Plan West, a municipal plan from 1958 for condemnations and urban renewal in the area. Alfred Benzons Fabrikker The south side of the square, from the roundabout up to the beginning of Sønder Boulevard, borders on the Meat Packing District. The original meat market was planned and designed by Hans Jørgen Holm in 1878 but over the years new buildings were added to the design of other architects, including Øksnehallen by Ludvig Fenger in 1901. The section closest to the Central Station is known as the Brown Meat District. It is the older part and generally dates from about 1900. The section closest to Sønder Boulevard is known as the White Meat District and was built in the first half of the 1930s to the design of City Architect Poul Holsøe. Halmtorvet 29 is the former headquarters of Alfred Benzon A/S. Halmtorvet today Restaurant in the White Meat District Halmtorvet is now lined on either side by cafés and restaurants. Part of the Brown Meat District, Øksnehallen at No. 11, a former market building, now serves as an exhibition venue which houses a broad variety of events, exhibitions and flea markets. Husets Teater is a small studio theatre based in another building of the Brown Meat District. Borgenhus, the modern building at No. 20, houses Station City, the Copenhagen Police Department's police station for the city centre.

Rev. Dr. James F. Jones, D.D and as Prophet Jones, was an American black religious leader, televangelist, faith healer and pastor who led the religious movement that developed into the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God, Inc. from 1938 until his death in 1971. As \\"Prophet Jones\\", James F. Jones claimed and his followers ascribed to him, divine powers from God as a special premillennial \\"incarnation of the spirit of Jesus Christ\\". Jones was a contemporary of other religious leaders at that time including Daddy Grace, Father Divine, C. L. Franklin, Charles Harrison Mason and Elijah Muhammad. Jones came to Detroit as a missionary for the southern-based Pentecostal sect, Triumph the Church and Kingdom of God in Christ. He thus led two of the largest predominantly black Pentecostal churches in Detroit during the 1940s and 1950s. He broadcast live weekly sermons over Canadian stations CKLW reaching the Midwest. In 1955 he began hosting Sunday night programs on WXYZ-TV, making him the first black preacher in Detroit to host a weekly television program. He was well known for his late-night services, which were broadcast in Detroit. Jones died at 63 years old and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit. Early life and mission James Francis Marion Jones was born in Birmingham, Alabama on November 24, 1907. His father, a railroad brakeman named James W. Jones, married a schoolteacher named Catherine Lewis. He was their only child. In 1912 the five-year-old James F. Jones joined and began preaching sermons in Triumph the Holy Righteous Church. The Triumph the Holy Righteous Church was a Black Nationalist/Pentecostal church founded by Father Elias Dempsey Smith in 1902 that Jones' parents, former members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, converted to. Young Jones preached in the tents, convocations and other venues of the early Triumph Church as a child prodigy. In 1915, Triumph the Holy Righteous Church changed its name to Triumph the Church and Kingdom of God in Christ. Its leader, Father Smith, was anointed Holy Apostle, Priest and King of the Triumph the Church and Kingdom of God. Smith claimed, and his followers believed, that he was divinely inspired to found and lead the Triumph Church and that God spoke directly to him. Jones in 1944, thirty years later, started a similar church called the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God, in Detroit, Michigan, wherein he and his teachings would both emulate and supplant those of Father Smith amongst his own followers. In 1917 at eleven years old, Jones quit school. He spent his life evangelizing, preaching, prophesying and pasturing in the Triumph cause, as he understood and eventually reinterpreted it. As an adult Jones said when he was a little boy God spoke to him and told him he was destined to \\"distil\\" great and good thoughts in the minds of men. In 1924 Jones, popularly called \\"sonny\\" and \\"son\\", became an officially ordained minister in the Southern-based Triumph the Church and Kingdom of God in Christ at age 18. Jones rose steadily within the Triumph Church after becoming a fully accredited officer. By the 1930s he attained the status of a \\"Prince\\" inside the Triumph Church hierarchy. Triumph Church ministry and the formation of a new church In 1938 the expanding Triumph sect sent Jones, accompanied by his adolescent personal secretary James Walton, to Detroit as a missionary. Jones, had traveled extensively on Triumph Church business for many years without 'purse or script' in such states as Missouri, Tennessee and Georgia. In Detroit Jones began a radio ministry. It was around this time that he became known to the public by the title in which he became famous, \\"Prophet Jones\\". The national Triumph Church claimed that gifts and offerings to Jones' ministry were rightfully its property. Jones disagreed and soon thereafter broke away from the Triumph Church to embark on forming his own group that he named 'Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God'. Jones proclaimed that the split with Triumph was purely for spiritual reasons as around this time he received word from God to manifest the Kingdom with himself as Prophet and Ruler preaching the \\"true gospel\\". According to the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God web-site, the command to form the organization was revealed to \\"Prophet\\" Jones, September 24, 1944, by the God of the universe supported by the scriptures, citing Rev. 11:15; 18:1–4; 21:1–5; Matthew 6:8,10, and Amos 3:7. Leadership of Universal Triumph Dominion of God In 1944, Jones formed his new corporation, called the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God, in Detroit. Prophet Jones preaching in November 1944 After breaking with the national Triumph Church, the new Universal Triumph the Dominion of God started in the Black Bottom area of Detroit. From a small frame church building Jones' following was moved to larger headquarters at the old Oriole Theater at 8450 Linwood Avenue in 1953. This large building is now New Bethel Baptist Church and was once pastored by C. L. Franklin, a former friend and later rival of Jones. Universal Triumph the Dominion of God later moved from the Oriole Theater and held services above the Fine Arts Theater at 2940 Woodward before finding a permanent home of worship at 1651 Ferry Park. In a religious subculture of competing claims, Jones declared that the almighty God spoke solely to him and that he was the second coming of Christ and thus was the world's 'one and only true prophet' and savior. As such he was God's 'Holiness' and sole 'Divine messenger' on Earth 'in these last days' with the divine powers to forecast, heal, bless and condemn. As the Universal Dominion Ruler, Jones presided over the Dominion services from a throne atop a raised, canopied dais on an elevated stage in front of the people. He gave his inner circle royal titles such as sir, prince, princess, lord, and lady. He called his flock the \\"citizens\\" of his dominion. He taught them his 'true gospel' from the Holy Bible in light of his 'divine revelation'. Universal Triumph the Dominion of God church Many of these teachings are found in the Dominion publications: The Ritual, The Message, The Mind Awakener, and the Dominion Constitution. His teachings revolved around him heralding God's incoming 'New World' of 'perfect bliss', in which the wicked would be destroyed but the faithful would live for ever in incorruptible physical bodies. He claimed those that are faithful now could have heaven on earth by recognizing his 'divine' calling and obeying his 'divine' wisdom and rules. In return, the citizens were to obey his Dominion rules, attend his weekly all- night ecstatic worship services, publicly testify to belief in his faith healing powers, celebrate his birthday, called Philamethyu, in lieu of Christmas and make gifts to him as tokens of their thanks, love, faith and devotion. The Dominion consisted of numerous churches called \\"Thankful Centers\\" around the United States and elsewhere. In a newspaper interview in 1953, Jones claimed about thirty-five churches and six million followers eventually belonged to or were 'registered into' his Dominion. Detroit's membership, called Thankful Center #1, was claimed to be about 1,500. His residences Jones lived the life of a millionaire. The first of his three Detroit parsonages was a three-story, multiroom mansion at 246 Ferry Avenue and was described as \\"luxurious\\" in an article in The Detroit News of July 2, 1944. This mansion is located in the East Ferry Avenue Historic District and was formerly the Fritz Funeral Home, one of the oldest black-owned firms of this type in Detroit. When Prophet Jones obtained the mansion, he operated it as a rooming house for twelve couples. This home is a large, elegant structure which consists of three floors and a basement. The third floor was a dance hall and entertainment room, with high ceilings and hardwood floors. The second floor included bedrooms and quarters for the maid. The first floor had a large living room, a dining room and a sun room. Prophet Jones' \\"French Castle\\" The second mansion was his Arden Park-East Boston Historic District parsonage and it was even larger than the first mansion and it was also claimed to be 'opulent' in the press. Aretha Franklin recalled as a child loving this Detroit mansion, which Jones painted a different color throughout the year. Prophet Jones called this mansion the \\"French Castle\\". It was also known as the \\"Dominion Residence\\". According to Hue magazine the Arden Park Dominion parsonage was previously a fifty-four-room former gambling casino, which Jones purchased from gambler Danny Sullivan. According to Ebony the house was purchased by his flock at reported cost at that time, $30,000. The house had been previously built in 1917 by General Motors Corporation executive Edmund A. Vier for $100,000. The house was styled after an 18th- century French chateau. The interior of the home was hand-carved woodwork, gold-painted ceilings, ornate brocade drapes and wall-to-wall carpeting with pile as deep as an English lawn. The home was also furnished with various exquisite furnishings, many of which were gifts from congregants and other well-wishers. Some of these gifts, such as a $7,000 grand piano, $8,000 worth of silver plate, a stained glass window installed at a cost of $1,200 and other rooms of expensive furniture, were so opulent that reports stated that 'they awed visitors'. A massive double door guarded the front entrance to the mansion, and Dominion security inspected visitors carefully through a glass panel before unlocking it. It was also reported in the press that of all of Jones' possessions, he cherished his expansive wardrobe of almost five hundred expensive matching suits and ties, exotic, colorful and bejeweled robes and ensembles, some foreign imported, others tailor-made specifically for him. Jones received visitors to the 'French castle' parsonage in a small paneled study, dominated by a life-size portrait of himself in a white robe. In a report in The Detroit News it was reported that the room was stiflingly hot because a gas fire burned in the fireplace twenty-four hours a day. When asked why this was so, the report stated Jones said that God had told him never to let the fire go out. The report also stated that children's toys were observed aligned along the fireplace of the study. Jones stated, when asked, that they were meant to symbolize \\"the lack of toys\\" in his own \\"impoverished boyhood\\". One of Prophet Jones' feasts Jones employed a personal staff of twelve domestic servants who were financed by the Dominion. His cooks went everywhere with him. \\"A great person preaching the unadulterated gospel has to be careful\\", he said. Jones alleged that the founder of the Triumph Church, Father Smith, had died in 1920 after being poisoned by adversaries. Later Jones sold his \\"French Castle\\" to rival Daddy Grace. This left him with his third large residence at 8311 La Salle Blvd, Detroit. This home continues to serves as the current Detroit Dominion parsonage. At his Arden Park home in the 1950s Jones hosted lavish eight-day-long birthday banquets, called Philamethyu and Hushdomcalama in his honor that were much covered in the press. Michigan governor G. Mennon Williams and Detroit mayor Albert Cobo sent him birthday greetings in 1954. Prominent African Americans from the elite of politics, business, sports, entertainment and music such as Lionel Hampton and his wife Gladys Hampton attended the birthday banquets and other gatherings held in the Sky Room. In addition to his high level parties and celebrations at his Arden Park parsonage the press also covered Jones's visit to Father Divine at his Pennsylvanian estate in 1953. Jones was also friendly with C. L. Franklin for some time. In addition to being interviewed by the likes of Burt Lancaster, a local Detroit TV reporter, Jones also employed his own press agent, Ulysses W. Boykin, the owner of the Detroit Tribune newspaper and a former staff aide to boxer Joe Louis. Another aide of Jones, Ophelia Kemp, was the mother of Hollywood actress Freda Rentie. Jones attended the famous singer Dinah Washington's funeral, and was classified as a mourner in the Jet 1964 issue. Death Jones died of a heart attack at 63 years old on August 12, 1971, at the Dominion parsonage on La Salle Blvd in Detroit under the care of a church \\"prince\\", \\"Lord\\" Claude Haley. At the time of his death, according to contemporary accounts in Jet magazine, church leaders were trying to design a crypt to place his body near his mother's at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. Jones had 15,000 people pay their last respects to him. More than 2,000 people, some from as far away as Canada and the Caribbean, came to his funeral, which was held at the Adlai Stevenson Building Auditorium on Grand River. Over 20 Universal Dominion ministers from 36 states and the West Indies took part in and officiated at the funeral services. The pastor and famed gospel singer, Reverend Louis H. Narcisse of California, also traveled to Detroit to attend the funeral. Jones was buried at Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery in his silver embroidered robe, in a bronze coffin which had had his signature white mink coat placed on it during the services. Succession Pastor James Shaffer, an assistant to Jones who was 61 at the time of his death, became Jones' most logical successor. After a vote the Dominion Council and the Dominion Board of Trustees installed James Shaffer as the new 'Dominion ruler' and successor to Jones as leader of Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God. Legacy * Johnathan Walton of Watch This! explained, \\"Whether Jones was a healer or not his place in popular culture in the 1950s was indisputable. This self-proclaimed seer and radio evangelist was favorably featured in such publications as Ebony magazine, Time (magazine), Life (magazine), Newsweek, and The Saturday Evening Post. * In the 1940s and 1950s Prophet Jones had mass acclaim, affluence and influence in the black religious landscape in many cities. * Images of Prophet Jones in magazines & on television in 1955 sitting on his throne, with gold jeweled fingers and wrist, draped in an ankle-length white mink coat atop sparkling robes may have aesthetically impacted the likes of Rev. Ike and gospel singer 'King' Solomon Burke of Philadelphia the former twenty years old and the latter sixteen at the time, as well as others. Some, like Bishop King Louis H. Narcisse of Mt. Zion's Spiritual Temple in California, considered Prophet Jones a 'divine predecessor'. The African American Religious Experience in America by Anthony Pinn states: \\"... Within the United States, particularly in the Detroit area, Jones is still mentioned in spiritual circles and spiritual leaders trained by him continue to be somewhat prominent in the Spiritual Movement.\\" * Prophet Jones' Detroit followers continue to worship and fellowship at the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God Headquarters, Thankful Center Number One located at 1651 Ferry Park, Detroit, Michigan 48206 . * Famous gospel singer, Professor Alex Bradford (1927-1978) as an adolescent was a follower of Prophet Jones. =Political power= Noted for his ardent U.S. patriotism, Prophet Jones opened his religious radio broadcast with the national anthem and the pledge of allegiance to the flag. A supporter of the Republican Party, Jones created a secular medal award, the Crispus Attucks, and presented it to Michigan's Republican Senator Homer S. Ferguson and Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson. In 1951 Prophet Jones delivered the invocation at the opening session of the Michigan State Legislature in Lansing. In 1952 Prophet Jones prophesied that General Dwight Eisenhower would win the 1952 presidential election. After Eisenhower's election victory Prophet Jones received an invitation to the inauguration. His attendance there was noted in the press. He stayed at the Rhode Island Plaza Hotel. Many of his supporters now looked at him as a prophet to the White House.

In the engagement, Sir William Brereton and the Parliamentarians were ultimately successful in taking possession of the city and Royalist garrison commanded by Lord Byron. Although the siege spanned nearly one and a half years, the degree to which the city was confined varied in intensity. Throughout the 16 month time period, conflicts continued to occur between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians in Cheshire and during the spring and summer of 1645, the Royalists were successful in causing the parliamentarians to temporarily lift the siege. Ultimately, however, the Parliamentarians enforced a total blockade and captured the city. Background At the outset of the English Civil War, Chester was held by forces loyal to King Charles. The city was especially important to the Royalists as its location on the River Dee and proximity to the Irish Sea made it an important gateway to both Ireland and North Wales. The central city was surrounded partially by the river and protected by strong city walls dating back to the times of the Romans. When the civil war broke out, the Royalists further strengthened the city walls and added a ring of earthwork defences extending out and around portions of the city to the north and east. In March 1643, Sir William Brereton was put in command of the Parliamentarian forces in Cheshire, an area where most of the gentry supported King Charles. Over the next year, Brereton took control over most of Cheshire. Chester, however, remained a Royalist strongpoint under the command of Lord Byron. September 1644 to March 1645 On 20 September 1644, Brereton advanced upon Chester and took possession of portions of the city's outworks. After Lord Byron rejected Brereton's summons for the city to surrender, a loose or partial siege of the city began. During this time, Brereton did what he could to stop the flow of provisions and munitions into the city, however, his force was not large enough to put a total blockade into effect. As a result, warfare continued outside the city as Royalists sallied out to attack Brereton's garrisons in Cheshire. In late October, Brereton responded by attempting to mount a concerted attack on the fortifications and overtake the city. When the attack failed, Brereton ended the assaults but continued the loose siege of the city. The siege of Chester continued through the fall and into the winter of 1645 until Brereton raised the siege on 19 February when Prince Maurice approached. The respite, however, lasted only for approximately 30 days as in mid-March Prince Rupert departed taking 1,200 seasoned troopers with him. This left Byron and Chester with only six hundred regular soldiers along with the citizens who took to arms to defend their city. Immediately thereafter, Brereton re-surrounded Chester and resumed the loose siege. Once again, however, the siege was interrupted approximately three week later when Brereton was ordered to withdraw his forces back to the River Mersey because of the reported approach of a Royalist army. This would then be the end of the Chester siege for many months over the spring and summer as in June Parliament scaled back their operations in Cheshire. Summer of 1645 Lord Byron, commander of the garrison On 14 June 1645, Charles's main army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Naseby by the New Model Army under Sir Thomas Fairfax. The King then withdrew to Hereford, hoping for more reinforcements from Wales and Ireland. Early in July 1645, he lodged at Raglan Castle in Wales. On 10 July his army in the west of England under Lord Goring was heavily defeated at the Battle of Langport, and news also reached Charles that an army of Covenanters was marching south. At the beginning of August 1645, Charles left Raglan with some 2,500 men, marching northwards along the Welsh border in the hope of rallying more Royalists to his cause in the north of England. He reached Doncaster on 18 August, where he had news that both the Parliamentary Northern Association army and a force of Covenanter cavalry were moving towards him. He quickly withdrew to Newark and then to Oxford, by way of a punitive attack on Huntingdon, Oliver Cromwell's home town and Parliamentary base. On 30 August the King marched to the assistance of his forces at Hereford, by now under siege by Lord Leven's Covenanters, but as the royal army approached news reached Leven of Montrose's victory on 15 August at the Battle of Kilsyth. He abandoned the siege of Hereford, marching north, so that Charles was able to occupy the town on 4 September. The King returned to Raglan, where some two weeks later he received news that Prince Rupert had surrendered Bristol. September 1645 to February 1646 Chester's city walls in September 1645. St John the Baptist's Church was badly damaged by the Parliamentarians during the siege With his remaining forces, Charles marched north from Raglan, hoping to join Montrose, not knowing that on 13 September Montrose had suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Philiphaugh. The Committee of Both Kingdoms at that time instructed Sydnam Poyntz to pursue and contain the King. Following his orders, Poyntz set out with a mounted force of some 3,000 cavalry and dragoons. The King continued to advance to the north and on 22 September he reached Chirk Castle where he received news of a Parliamentarian attack on Chester. Early on 20 September 1645, just before daylight, a New Model Army force of more than 700 infantry and an equal number of cavalry, led by Colonel Michael Jones, began a fresh assault on Chester. The attack broke through the outer Royalist earthworks in the eastern suburbs. After Jones had ordered the burning of the urban areas in front of the east gate, he moved artillery up to St John the Baptist's Church to bombard the city wall. By 22 September when the King arrived at Chirk, Jones' guns had already created a breach in Chester's walls. After receiving the news of the attack, King Charles set out for Chester with all possible speed. The King reached Chester on 23 September with an advance party consisting of his lifeguards, Gerard's brigade of some 600 horse, and a small number of foot soldiers. This force was able to enter the city from the western bank of the River Dee as it was still under Royalist control. Meanwhile, in the hope of trapping the besieging forces between the King's main army and an enlarged garrison within the city, Sir Marmaduke Langdale took approximately 3,000 troopers from the King's cavalry north towards Chester by means of Holt at dawn on 24 September. Moving north-east, Langdale received reports near the village of Rowton that Poyntz's Parliamentarian cavalry was approaching Chester from Whitchurch, Shropshire. Poyntz, who had ridden through the night to intercept the Royalist army, came upon Langdale and the Royalist cavalry at Rowton Moor. The two opposing forces battled for several hours with neither gaining an advantage until 2:00 pm when Parliamentarian reinforcements arrived from Chester. King Charles is said to have watched the ensuing defeat of his forces at the Battle of Rowton Heath from the Phoenix Tower on Chester's city walls. After the arrival of the Parliamentarian reinforcements, the Royalist cavalry was routed. Among the Royalist killed in the battle were King Charles' cousin Lord Bernard Stewart. King Charles remained in Chester overnight, but on 25 September, he broke away with a force of 500 mounted troopers and rode to Denbigh in North Wales. Byron remained behind with the Royalist garrison at Chester. That same morning, the Parliamentarians re-encircled the town and re-initiated the bombardment. By the next day, the bombardment had created a breach in the city wall at Newgate. The Parliamentarians continued the bombardment and then on 8 October they attempted to enter the city by attacking. The Parliamentarians failed in their attack and ended their assaults deciding to tighten the blockage and continue the siege. The siege then continued for three months during which the Royalists would not surrender nor consider terms. During this time many inhabitants died of starvation. In January 1646, William Ince, the Mayor of Chester, persuaded Byron to consider terms. Negotiations began on 20 January and were concluded on 1 February. On 3 February, Brereton and the Parliamentarians occupied Chester. Aftermath The city of Chester suffered a great deal during the siege. In addition to the loss of life that occurred, many building including dwellings, mansions, barns, work-houses, dairy-houses, halls, and chapels were destroyed. Many churches were severely damaged. City funds were exhausted.

He is best known for his use of a Gatling gun in support of the Canadian militia in the North-West Rebellion of 1885. Life Howard's Gatling is at bottom right of the lithograph of the Battle of Batoche Howard served for five years in the regular United States Cavalry. After leaving the regular army, he lived in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was employed by Winchester Arms. Howard then formed a cartridge-making firm of his own called A.L. Howard & Co., but his business premises were destroyed by fire in 1883. On July 18, 1884, Howard was placed in command of the Machine Gun Platoon, Connecticut National Guard, with the rank of Second Lieutenant.Article, \\"The Man with the Gatling Gun,\\" in The New York Times, May 18, 1885 When the North-West Rebellion of Métis and Indians broke out in western Canada, in March 1885, the Canadian militia commander, Major General Frederick Middleton, suggested that two Gatling guns be procured from the United States.Beal, Bob, and Macleod, Rod, Prairie Fire, McClelland and Stewart, Toronto, 1994, p.171 Dr. Richard J. Gatling, the gun's inventor, began searching for a man who was an expert in the use of the Gatling, and selected Lieutenant Howard. Howard agreed to go to Canada with the two Gatlings. He was granted a month's leave of absence from the Guard (later extended). The Connecticut Guard later made it plain that they had \\"no hand\\" in Howard's planned expedition.Article, \\"The Man with the Gatling Gun\\" Howard left his wife and four children and a comfortable middle class life to travel to the North-West Territories with the Gatlings. His fascination with the Gatling gun, and scientific determination to test it under arduous battle conditions seem to have motivated his undertaking a dangerous mission which completely lacked U.S. government sanction – although this did not deter him from wearing his blue American officer's uniform in Canada, even on the battlefield. Howard's unofficial status was made even plainer when Dr. Gatling said that the lieutenant was not working for the Gatling manufacturer. He was travelling to Canada, Dr. Gatling said, merely as \\"a friend of the gun.\\"Howard, Joseph Kinsey, Strange Empire: A Narrative of the Northwest, William Morrow and Company, New York, 1952, pp. 451-453 Howard journeyed, partly by rail, partly overland, to Swift Current, North-West Territories. There he gave a demonstration of the weapon to some fascinated Canadian militiamen and Mounted Police, one of whom wrote: \\"These curious instruments of destruction we inspect with interest, and their trial is watched eagerly. A few rounds are fired at some duck on a distant pond – no execution is done apparently, but the rapidity of fire shows us how very deadly a weapon of this kind might be on proper occasions. We want now to see one tried on the Indians...\\"Beal and Macleod, p. 238 One of the Gatlings was used at the Battle of Cut Knife on May 2, 1885. However eyewitness accounts make it clear that Howard was not present; rather, the gun was operated by Canadian gunners.Mulvany, Charles Pelham, The History of the North-West Rebellion of 1885, Hovey & Co., Toronto, 1886, pp. 156-185 Howard himself and one Gatling embarked on the South Saskatchewan River aboard the steamboat Northcote, by which he travelled to Fish Creek, arriving on May 5, 1885.Howard, p. 455 There he formed part of a Canadian militia column, which then moved on Louis Riel's capital at Batoche. On May 9, 1885, the first day of the Battle of Batoche, Howard fired some of the first shots from the militia side, aiming some rounds at the Roman Catholic rectory (the bullet holes may still be seen). He distinguished himself in action later that day, when his prompt and courageous actions prevented a group of the Métis from capturing one or more Canadian field guns. He was shifted that day from place to place so that the Gatling's firepower could be used to beat off significant enemy attacks. On May 12, 1885, the final day of the battle, Howard and his Gatling were again in the thick of the fighting, being brought up to defeat the last resistance near the village of Batoche.Beal and Macleod, pp. 265-266 and p. 276 After the militia victory, Howard stayed in Canada, and became a wealthy cartridge manufacturer. On the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he became a machine-gun officer in the Canadian Mounted Rifles. He then organized a unit called the Canadian Scouts, with the rank of major.

The book gives a brief history of the bicycle from its start in the early 1800s, when it could only be afforded by the wealthy, through to the present. He talks of the 1890s when bicycles were inexpensive enough for commoners to afford, yet automobiles had yet to be mass produced, and city streets were filled with bikes leading the League of American Wheelmen to lobby for paved roads. The end of World War II saw a decline in the bicycle as automobiles became more a way of life. The 1970s saw a boom in the American bicycle market, to again decline in the 1980s. Most recently, Mapes looked at several then-current politicians who were outspoken about bicycle advocacy such as then-chairman Jim Oberstar (D-MN) of the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure who Mapes calls the highest regarded cycling supporter in Congress. Later chapters look at cycling in cities such as Amsterdam, Davis, California, Portland, Oregon, and New York City. The final chapters detail some of the risks and rewards of bicycling. The trade journal Library Journal highly recommends this book for all libraries. Cycling advocate John Allen argues that the book is most valuable for the attention to detail, saying \\"the book will be a valuable resource... for historians some twenty or fifty years in the future\\". Reviews Former Talking Heads member and current New York Times contributor David Byrne writes that the book contains more than facts and figures. Mapes inserts anecdotes about his own life and bicycling. He recalls when he switched jobs and was forced from commuting by bike to car. He found he gradually got depressed from the lack of exercise. Mapes argues that promoting cycling will raise the fitness level of the general population. One review says that the book is written from a journalistic approach to cycling advocacy, and does not represent advocacy itself. Brett Campbell summarizes Mapes' chapters on individual cities by saying that even in cities that are now considered bike-friendly such as Portland, Oregon, biking wasn't always so easy. Mapes said he purposefully left out references to bike-friendly Eugene, Oregon because he didn't want to make the book too specific to Oregon. Campbell further notes that progress towards more livable cities in American has slowed compared to European counterparts like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Ann Robinson writing in The Oregonian says that \\"Pedaling Revolution is easily the best book-length examination of cycling culture and its connection to big-picture issues.\\" The target audience of Pedaling Revolution is middle-class Americans urbanites who don't know that they can use a bicycle for commuting or utility purposes such as grocery shopping. Further praise from Megan Hill writing for the Matador Network, saying the book \\"proves that the movement towards bicycle-friendly streets goes beyond just cycling; it fits into the larger solution for smarter urban planning and more liveable cities.\\" Kelly Nelson, writing on the Carbusters.org site, says that she would \\"be more convinced, however, that a pedaling revolution is truly underway if he had detailed thriving bike cultures in Atlanta, Dallas and Las Vegas.\\" Themes In the book, Mapes makes an argument that making more room for the bicycle on American roads is something that we need. Mapes' book was published one year after J. Harry Wray's book Pedal Power that explored how the bicycle rose as a cultural and political force in America. Jonathan Maus at BikePortland.org was impressed with the scope of the book. Most of the research for the book took place during a six months sabbatical from work. Maus thinks that Mapes drew too fine a line between vehicular cyclists like John Forester and more mainstream cycling advocates, saying \\"I think some readers might get the sense that the battle for ideas between VC advocates and more mainstream advocates... is greater than it actually is.\\" Stacey Moses, comments that every cycling advocate will be attracted to one or two major issues in the book from participation in Critical Mass, playing cycle polo in the street, or securing funding for Safe Routes to School. Pedaling Revolution shows that these inseparably issues are linked, and that creating and fostering a bicycle culture with youth is needed to fully understand alternative transportation issues. A recurring theme in the book is safety, with the main thesis that cycling safety is related to the number of cyclists. The more cyclists there are, the safer the streets are for bikes and pedestrians. This is reflected in the chapter on Davis, California, which Mapes describes as \\"ten square miles surrounded by reality\\", where bicycles have reached a critical mass where drivers are now more cognizant of them. Mapes spends quite a lot of the book talking about the differences between men and women cycling in urban cities. He concludes that women are more reluctant to bike than men over safety concerns, and that the best indicator of a cities bike safety is the ratio of men to women cyclists. For cycling to attain a significant share of the transportation market, it will need to appear safer to attract the risk- averse. Amsterdam has nearly fifty percent of its population on a bike everyday, without bike helmets, because cycling is seen as a safe activity. In a 2009 interview, Mapes concedes that he would be surprised to see bicycling see a 30 percent mode share, and that doing so would require a national commitment. But he did think that portions of cities, such as Portland's east side, may achieve such levels. A review of the reviews on TreeHugger points out that even the best bicycling city in the United States only has about 30% of bicycle users being women. Other readers have focused on the safety issue from a traffic justice movement standpoint. This view holds that improving safety should focus on the most vulnerable users. Efforts would include more aggressive traffic laws enforcement and holding drivers responsible in collisions with pedestrians or cyclists.

CEM was restructured with the former Portuguese administration's support in 1982. In 1985, CEM signed the 25-year concession contract. It has since scored achievements in the areas of cost-effectiveness and technology. In November 2010, the Government of Macau and CEM signed the Power Supply Contract Extension for 15 years. The new contract terms came into effect on 1 December 2010. In 2014, Nam Kwong (Group) Company Limited purchased a 90% stake in Sino–French Energy Development Co. from Sino-French Holdings (Hong Kong) Ltd and became CEM’s biggest shareholder. In 2016, the Macau Power Station with a history of over 110 years was officially decommissioned.  Logo  The CEM logo is a symbol of the company's close ties with customers, Macau and its employees, represented by three dynamic and vibrant curved lines that are well-designed to accentuate a harmonious, interdependent and collaborative relationship. The logo is simple and vivid, with yellow representing energy and vitality, and orange representing prosperity.  Transmission and distribution  The Macau electricity transmission network comprises 25 primary substations, 8 customer high-voltage switching stations and 953 kilometres of 66 kV, 110 kV and 220 kV high-voltage cables. The Macau electricity network is connected to China Southern Power Grid via two 110 kV cables and two 220 kV cables. The two 110 kV cables are connected to Gongbei Substation and Nanping Substation, while the two 220 kV cables are connected to Zhuhai Substations and Qinyun Substation. The 11kV medium-voltage electricity transmission network comprises 41 customer switching stations and 1,502 customer substations (11 kV/400 V) connected by cables with a total length of 2,294 kilometres. The low-voltage transmission network is made up of 906 kilometres of cable, while the street lighting network comprises 571 kilometres of cable and about 11,105 streetlights. The power network of CEM consists almost entirely of underground cables.  Performance  According to CEM's annual report, in 2018, the Average Service Availability Index (ASAI) was 99.9998%, while the Customer Average Interruption Duration Index was 6.56 minutes, achieving the goal of less than 20 minutes. CEM adopted international management standards to ensure the compliance of sustainable development in the company. So far, CEM has been certified with the following international standards: *ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, since 2003 *OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System, since 2006 * ISO 9001 Quality Management System, since 2007 *ISO 14064 Greenhouse Gases Management System, since 2010 *ISO 20000 IT Service Management System, since 2013  Generation  The actual capacity of CEM’s generation consists of two power stations located on the Coloane Island, namely Coloane Power Station A (CCA) and Coloane Power Station B (CCB). The types of generation technology deployed are the low speed diesel generator (CCA) and the combined cycle gas turbine (CCB). Shareholders Shares of CEM are currently owned by Nam Kwong Development (H.K.) Limited (42%), Energy Asia Consultancy (21%), Polytech Industrial (11%), Asiainvest - Investments (10%), Government of Macau (8%), China Power International Holding (6%) and other investors (2%). Before 1987, the largest shareholder of CEM was the Government of Macau. But ever since that, the government had been reducing its share until the current 8%. The former largest shareholder of CEM, Sino-French Energy Development, was majority owned by listed companies NWS Holdings and Suez Environnement via an intermediate holding company Sino-French Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited. In 2014 Sino-French Holdings sold 90% stake in Sino French Energy Development to Chinese state-owned enterprise (via its HK subsidiary Nam Kwong Development (H.K.) Limited); the remaining 10% stake of Sino-French Energy Development was owned by Hong Kong-Macau billionaire Stanley Ho. Sino-French Energy Development was merged with its direct parent company Nam Kwong Development in 2019. Chinese Central government also owned another shareholder of CEM, China Power International Holding. That company was owned by State Power Investment Corporation (ex-China Power Investment Corporation).

They are usually crudely-drawn in Microsoft Paint or other simple drawing programs, and were most popular in the early 2010s. These webcomics have spread much in the same way that internet memes do, and several memes have originated in this medium. They have been characterized by Ars Technica as an \\"accepted and standardized form of online communication.\\" The popularity of rage comics has been attributed to their use as vehicles for humorizing shared experiences. The range of expression and standardized, easily identifiable faces has allowed uses such as teaching English as a foreign language.  History  Although used on numerous websites such as Reddit, Cheezburger, ESS.MX, Ragestache, and 9GAG, the source of the rage comic has largely been attributed to 4chan in mid-2008. The first rage comic was posted to the 4chan /b/ \\"Random\\" board in 2008. It was a simple 4-panel strip showing the author's anger about getting \\"splashback\\" while on the toilet, with the final panel featuring a zoomed-in face, known as Rage Guy, saying\\" FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-\\". It was quickly reposted and modified, with other users creating new scenarios and characters. Google Trends data shows that the term \\"rage guy\\" peaked in April 2009 while the terms \\"rage comics\\" and \\"troll face\\" both peaked in March 2009. = Trollface = One of the most widely used rage comic faces is the Trollface, drawn by Oakland artist Carlos Ramirez in 2008. Originally posted in a comic to his DeviantArt account Whynne about Internet trolling on 4chan, the trollface is a recognizable image of Internet memes and culture. Ramirez has used his creation, registered with the United States Copyright Office in 2009, to gain over $100,000 in licensing fees, settlements, and other payouts. The video game Meme Run for Nintendo's Wii U console was taken down for having the trollface as the main character.

He was president of the Keeper of the Mountains Foundation and lifetime member of the Sierra Club. He also was a board member for the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition. Childhood and early life The Gibson family ancestors have originally lived in the Kayford Mountain area since the 1700s, but when Gibson was a child, his family moved from the home where he was born to an urban town in northern Ohio. Ironically, his father and grandfather were both coalminers and he had many other relatives who worked in the mines. The family were very poor and moved around the different coal camps of the area. Gibson’s father lost his job while Larry was still studying in fourth grade. He went on to work in the automobile industry at General Motors until an injury forced him into early retirement. He returned to Kayford Mountain shortly afterwards, where he found that mountaintop mining operations had become so prevalent that one nearly infringed on his family’s cemetery plot. This cemetery plot was eventually desecrated by mining equipment, an act that he stood by to witness in the early 2000s. Living in such a beautiful landscape inspired Gibson at a young age; he once said, “Growing up here was an adventure every day. I played with my pet bobcat, my fox, my hawk. All of these things, the good Lord provided on this land.” Activism When Gibson returned to Kayford Mountain in the mid-1980s, mining companies had just started to buy small plots of land from the local communities to dynamite the mountain peaks and dig for coal. The scale of the industry grew annually with great speed and according to current campaigners, 500 mountains across Virginia and Kentucky have been stripped of trees and flattened, and some 1,200 mountain streams have been buried beneath rock and debris. Gibson began his activism by using the area as an exhibition of mountaintop mining and he achieved this by inviting reporters, celebrities, other activists and locals to observe the large-scale digging operations. Gibson also wandered the state educating locals on the mining activities’ effects, having once walked from Harper’s Ferry across southern West Virginia to Huntington on his own, speaking to communities he encountered on the way of his campaign. For decades, Gibson continued his activism, despite being offered millions of dollars by mining companies to leave the area. Building a two-room cabin on the mountain, Gibson pitched himself in for the long-haul while his wife stayed in a nearby town, even persuading his cousins to build similar shacks nearby. He travelled nationally and internationally, speaking to community groups, political rallies, shareholder meetings and government agencies, usually wearing his trademark baseball cap and neon-green T-shirt with the motto “Love them or leave them, just don’t destroy them.” Money was not the only tactic that was employed to stop Gibson; he is only to keen to show visitors bullet holes in the wood of his cabin, the same cabin that was also ransacked at one point. There have also been attempts on his life when his truck was run off the road on a few occasions by coal trucks, at one point with a Washington Post reporter inside. Two of his dogs were killed. He had effigies of him burned, endured threatening phone calls and was beaten up more than once. Gibson was arrested on numerous occasions and had no fear in doing so; one fellow activist said that she could not count the number of times he was arrested during his campaigns. On more than one occasion, he was arrested at the Capitol Building in Washington whilst protesting with others on the government’s lack of backing for the campaign. In 2004, Gibson started the Keepers of the Mountain Foundation to raise awareness of his campaign and to inspire others to his cause. Recognition There are many environmentalists that say they have drawn inspiration from his character of activism, among them the 350.org founder Bill McKibben, the environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the climate scientist James Hansen. CNN recognised Gibson for his efforts and awarded him the CNN Heroes award in 2007. He was also the subject of an ABC documentary in their 20/20 television series. Death At the age of 66, Larry Gibson died of a heart attack on 9 September 2012 at his home in West Virginia. Gibson left behind a wife and three children.

One of the other founders of the line was William Carson. History The primary of the Eel River and Eureka Railroad ran from the line's office and depot at the foot of Second Street, Eureka to Burnell's station, a town near Hydesville. The longest tunnel was nearly through Table Bluff between the stops of Salmon Creek and Swauger's Station. By 1896, the Eel River and Eureka Railroad was running passenger trains twice a day, every day but Sunday when there were three trains. From June 1895 to June 1896, the line had 32,811 passengers who paid a total of $24,748.70 in fares. In the same period, the line earned $67,568.85 from lumber and freight, over 3,000 tons of which was butter from the Eel River Valley dairies. After the junction at Alton the Pacific Lumber Company Railroad extended south about through and slightly beyond the town of Scotia. In October 1902, all the property and rights of the Eel River and Eureka Railroad were transferred to the San Francisco and Northwestern Railway. The tracks became part of a continuous line from San Francisco to Trinidad in the summer of 1914. On December 28, 1918, the San Francisco and Northwestern Railway transferred the assets to the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. The line was considered one of the toughest in the nation to build and maintain. left Depot buildings were added at all major stops. A roundhouse and depot were built in Eureka, California.

It has been performed in Somerville, Massachusetts, and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The performance incorporates burlesque and tango dancers, drag kings, hoopers, ballerinas, acrobats, and belly dancers in a retelling of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet from the point of view of a young woman who experiences a sexual awakening during a holiday dream-like sequence. Plot The story takes place on Christmas Eve when gifts are exchanged between a newly engaged adult couple (Clara and Fritz) and a friend (Drosselmeyer). Unlike Tchaikovsky's original story where a godfather gives his niece a \\"nutcracker doll\\" as a gift, this friend chooses to give Clara a vibrator to allow sexual self stimulation. After Clara is embarrassed by the new gift and Fritz feels threatened by it after unsuccessful intercourse, Fritz tries to damage the vibrator. The vibrator repairs itself and, through adamant and persistent action, is able to win Clara over. A battle then ensues in Clara's imagination between her staid, sexually-repressed friends and forces including such entities as batteries, bunnies, and hoopers who are all led by the anthropomorphized vibrator, now known as the Slutcracker. After winning the battle, the Slutcracker transforms himself into a type of Prince who takes Clara to a realm of sexual fantasy where repressed desires can be lived out. There she encounters people and things such as dancers who disrobe each other, a bondage dominatrix, pole dancers, Amy (a candy cane dildo which shoots bubbles), topless fan dancers, synchronized swimmers who engage in a type of orgy and a fairy who performs a striptease. Roles in relation to Nutcracker counterparts The following is a list of roles for the performance: =Act I= Clara- Nutcracker counterpart: Clara Protagonist. A twentysomething female trapped in suburban doldrums, but oblivious to her entrapment until Drosselmeyer gives her a vibrator, which becomes the Slutcracker Prince, who shows Clara a sexual spectrum. Fritz- Nutcracker counterpart: Rat King Antagonist. A twenty- something male also trapped in suburban doldrums, and also oblivious to this fact. Proposes marriage to Clara (which she accepts), but then breaks the engagement when the vibrator arrives on the scene. Fritz battles the Slutcracker Prince for her affection, and loses. Fritz returns later to try to win Clara back, and does after learning to accept sexual variety. Drosselmeyer- Nutcracker counterpart: Drosselmeyer Hero Assist. Drosselmeyer is the giver of the \\"slutcracker,\\" represented as a pink vibrator. This initially embarrasses Clara, and humiliates/infuriates Fritz, who feels threatened by it. Drosselmeyer pursues and prevails in bestowing the gift, which ultimately grows up to be the Vibrator Prince. Slutcracker Prince- Nutcracker counterpart: Nutcracker Prince Hero. Anthropomorphized Vibrator. Battles suburban doldrums and wins. Has sex with Clara, giving her her first real orgasm, thereby showing her the \\"light.\\" He then brings her to the land of Sexual Fantasy (ACT II) Party Goers- Nutcracker counterpart: Party Goers (Parents, Grandparents, children) These are Clara and Fritz's friends, all presumably straight, vanilla, suburban couples who attend their Xmas party. Each couple will have its own idiosyncrasies and subplots which will play out beginning with the opening vignettes and continuing through the Battle Scene, when they don \\"bad\\" X-mas sweaters and assist Fritz in battling the Slutcracker Prince. NOTE: Not all party goers will participate in the Battle Scene, analogous to the battle between mice and gingerbread soldiers in the original Nutcracker. Team Bad Xmas Sweater- Nutcracker Counterpart: Mice/Rats The Party Goers who participate in the Battle Scene Batteries- Nutcracker Counterpart: Tin Soldiers The batteries quite literally power the Slutcracker Prince and help him to defeat Team Bad Xmas Sweaters. Slutcracker Bunny- Nutcracker counterpart: Bunny The Slutcracker Bunny, much like the Energizer bunny, beats a drum and assists the Batteries. Orgasm Hoopers- Nutcracker counterpart: Snowflakes Illuminated hoop dancers who represent Clara's orgasm (big, spinning, blinking, Os), which ends ACT I =Act II= Bacchanalia- Nutcracker Counterpart: Angels There are TWO COMPONENTS to Bacchanalia, which are called CORPS and FLUFFERS. CORPS are the dancers on stage. FLUFFERS are the dancers flitting about in the audience. The Bacchanalia Corps (lovingly called Baklava backstage) serves as the welcoming committee for Clara and Slutcracker. They welcome her to the land of sexual fantasy where she is invited to be sexy, free, indulged, and entertained. The fluffers will welcome the audience, flitting about, sprinkling rose petals, giving lapdances, high fives, fist bumps, kisses, etc. Tango- Nutcracker Counterpart: Spanish/Chocolate These are an ambi-sexual tango partner dancers, wherein the dancers change partners frequently while disrobing one another. Arabian- Nutcracker Counterpart: Arabian/Coffee Veiled, blindfolded, lesbian-bondage bellydancers. Chinese- Nutcracker Counterpart: Chinese/Tea Traditional Chinese fandancers, except topless. Russian- Nutcracker Counterpart: Russian/Trépak A trio of black PVC-clad dominatrixes number en pointe, with bull whips. Gimp- Nutcracker Counterpart: None A clever device used to set up the stripper pole. Dance of the Reed Pole- Nutcracker Counterpart: Dance of the Reed Pipes A solo pole dance privately entertaining Clara and Slutcracker Polichinelle- Nutcracker counterpart: Polichinelle An orgy of sexually ambiguous clowns. They all have imaginable sex organs, plus long, phallic noses. Waltz of the Flowers & Wet Spot Fairy- Nutcracker counterpart: Waltz of the Flowers and Dew Drop Fairy Six \\"Petals\\" encircle the centerpiece, the Wet Spot Fairy. This number is choreographed not unlike a 1960s synchronized swimming number or a geometric Busby Berkeley number (who actually directed at the Somerville Theatre in the 1920s). The costume is very intricate, as the Flower Petals' costumes all physically connect to the Wet Spot Fairy's costume, and all get plucked. Sugar Dish Fairy- Nutcracker counterpart: Sugar Plum Fairy This character performs a solo striptease en pointe, in a tutu. She performs the closing number before the finale. Reception The show began its initial holiday run in December 2008 at the prestigious Somerville Theatre in Greater Boston. The popularity of the show exceeded initial expectations as it sold out its first four shows in the 900-seat theatre. Two more shows were subsequently added. In the show's 2009 run, the number of performances were doubled from the previous year. Since the show's initial 2008 run, it has returned to the Somerville Theatre each December for successively longer runs and has expanded its tour to include post-holiday performances during January in Montreal's theatre district. The latest 2010 tour included 16 shows in Boston and 2 in Montreal. Controversy The Slutcracker's overt portrayal of sexual themes created some antagonistic responses from groups such as MassResistance, a conservative Christian group. Specifically the group expressed concern about the positive portrayal of homoeroticism, BDSM, promiscuity, and strippers as well as the inclusion of props such as the bubbles-shooting candy cane dildo featured prominently throughout the performance to suggest male orgasm.

Archery was declared the national sport in 1971, when Bhutan became a member of the United Nations. Since then, the popularity of Bhutanese archery has increased both inside and outside Bhutan, with a measure of government promotion. Bhutan also maintains an Olympic archery team. Previously, competitions were held only at dzongkhag and gewog levels, however modernly, archery tournaments and competitions are held throughout the country. Archery is played during religious and secular public holidays in Bhutan, local festivals (tsechu), between public ministries and departments, and between the dzonkhag and the regional teams. Archery tournaments and performances have also become a significant point of interest for tourism in Bhutan. Archery in Bhutan is culturally distinctive because it is a martial art practiced among a modern population that abhors killing. Bhutanese people from different social strata find archery one of the most enjoyable sports, being both fun and physical exercise. In addition, archery builds concentration, which contributes to mental development; according to a Bhutanese proverb, both sailing and archery require intelligence. Archery in Bhutan is a way of socialization, communication, and development of relations between people. Emotions run high during competitions, and support for archers and ridicule or distraction of opponents can become as violent as in other countries' sporting events. Archery competitions Archers dancing to celebrate a bullseye Archery competition in Thimphu Every village has a field for archery; Changlimithang Stadium in Thimphu is one of the kingdom's most prominent archery fields. The most notable archery competition in Bhutan are Coronation National Archery tournament and Yangphel tournament. Other major archery competitions are held during Losar, the Bhutanese and Tibetan New Year. The distance to the target is about . The relatively small targets are cut from wood and brightly painted, usually measuring about tall and wide. Bullseyes are called karay. Traditionally, Bhutanese bows are made of bamboo, and arrows from bamboo or reeds, fletched with feather vanes. Arrows may be painted and tipped with metal arrowheads. Quivers may be wooden, with an animal hide covering and a woven strap. Bhutanese archery teams number at 13 players; teams take turns shooting two arrows at a time first in one direction, then in the opposite direction. The first to score 25 points wins, however because the scoring system is complicated, winning can take a very long time. For example, a second hit by an opponent can invalidate the other player's score. In addition, the interplay of wider socializing and festivities, with archery as the nominal focus, gives Bhutanese archery competitions an excruciatingly slow pace. In the past, the most traditional matches could last for as long as a month, though modern matches tend to span a number of days. Preparations for archery matches are different from other sports: competitors are advised not to spend the night with their wives the night before the competition in order to achieve a high level of concentration. On the eve of a competition, the team spends the night in the woods or in a barn. Opening events precede the initiation and breakfast, and alcoholic beverages can be consumed on the morning of competitions. Teams often employ astrologers to select competing members. In their prognostications, astrologers use puppets (tsip) to symbolize archers, puppets of fate who have no control of their destiny. These astrologers are often hired at substantial fees in archers' attempts to have favorable tsip performances, cast curses against other archers, and gain an upper hand. Astrologers also calculate the time and place for competition. Modern archery competitions feature compound bows, corporate sponsorships, copious cash and material winnings, injuries, and occasional fatalities. The popularity of archery has raised questions of Bhutan's susceptibility to doping, including by alcohol, in the sport. The increased modern popularity of archery has also drawn attention to the danger in the sport, especially to spectators, residents, and passers by near archery ranges. Since 2010, Bhutan has held the Lyonchen Jigmi Y Thinley Archery Tournament, encouraging the use of traditional bows and the development of gewog teams. Women in archery Archery cheerleading Women in Bhutan are traditionally active participants in archery competitions, both at home and on the sidelines. To support their husbands, archers' wives prepare their best dishes and drinks. Their older children prepare and bring butter tea and alcoholic beverages to the shooting range, accompanied by younger children. Men participating in the match then bestow upon friends and the match coordinators food and beverages prepared by their wives. During the matches, women cheer their husbands or favorites with heavily symbolic songs. They also mock opponents with distracting gesticulations and humorous insults. One insult goes: \\"Whose forehead is bulging and swollen like a wine-serving spoon, in aimless flight his shaft will drift to hit the mark not even once, Ah kha kha thu lu lu!\\" (Kuchu pehew gi da mephog, phog rung bam i pchi lay yeen, Ah kha kha thu lu lu!) Another more burlesque insult goes: \\"Lips sheltered in a black beard, in aimless flight his shaft will drift to hit the mark not even once, Ah kha kha thu lu lu!\\" (Kha nag pu so da me phog, phog rung bam i pchi lay yeen, Ah kha kha thu lu lu!) Regarding archery, one Bhutanese proverb says, \\"Archery and discus are to men, as songs and dances are to women,\\" indicating archery is a traditionally male-dominated sport. Nonetheless, modern prominent archers include Dorji Dema and Tshering Chhoden, two Bhutanese women. Verbal battles Competing archers also engage in verbal battle, giving players a chance to display intellectual and literary skills. In archery matches, bombarding opponents with verbal confrontation is equally important to scoring bullseyes. Players and teammates praise their own arrows, lend advice and encouragement to each other, and demean opponents in florid literary expressions known as kha shed. Competitors must be prepared to provoke or reply in an equal or more impressive literary fashion. One such line from a verbal battle goes: \\"Where the vulture flies, my stone shall fly, there to collide.\\" (Bjagoed phu sa do chap kay), demeaning the opponent and promising a bullseye to reset his team's score. History Black Hat Dance with drums, Paro Tsechu Throughout the history of Bhutan, fire and the bow and arrow were an important means of survival in the highlands during war and on hunts. The bow and arrow play a significant role in many Bhutanese myths and legends; images of the gods holding a bow and arrows are considered especially favorable. Symbolic and religious significance of the bow and arrow is associated with the legendary murder of Tibetan King Langdarma in the 10th century. The king had persecuted Buddhism, and thus failed to perform his duty as he made mischief. A Buddhist monk, Lhalung Pelgyi Dorje, performed the Black Hat Dance to entertain the king, during which he feigned a bow before the king, drew a bow and arrow hidden in the big sleeves of a ceremonial dance costume, and killed the king. In the 15th century, most prophecies by Lama Drukpa Kunley are believed to have originated from his bow and arrows. Modernly, the bow and arrows are an obligatory feature of any religious ceremony, ritual, festival, and holiday in Bhutan. Archery has also been a favorite sport of the King of Bhutan, handed down from generation to generation. During the Bhutanese period of theocratic rule (1616–1907), there was no regular standing army. The bow and arrow were among the principal means of arming the population during frequent upheavals and invasions. During times of crisis, the government raised militias from among local lords' retinues, all commanded by one dapon (Dzongkha: མདའ་དཔོན་; Wylie: mdaa-dpon; \\"arrow chief\\"). The title dapon continued to be used among military cadres well after the establishment of the Bhutanese monarchy in 1907. The cultural significance of archery in Bhutan can be observed at shrines to local gods, where historically arrows were confiscated as tribute and in modern times are often left as offerings.

He is also a practicing Sufi  Background and education  Etsko Schuitema was born to Jurjen and Johanna Schuitema in Klerksdorp, a mining town in the North West province of South Africa. Both his parents were in the mining industry, and as such he had been exposed to the South African mining industry from a young age. Etsko's elder brother is Jerry Schuitema, a South African journalist, author and retired management consultant. In 1980, Schuitema completed an Honours degree in Social Anthropology from the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa and in 1980 was subsequently employed by the Human Resources Laboratory of the South African Chamber of Mines as a researcher. In 1984, he led the research team to perform research on employee discontent.  Career  = Period = The research was done during the peak of apartheid in South Africa. The gold mines were South Africa's biggest industry; with its workforce coming from all the ethnic tribes of the region and they reflected the problems that were plaguing South Africa during the apartheid regime. = Research = The Chamber of Mines Research Organisation commissioned Schuitema and his team to find out what was causing employee conflict in the mines at the organisation. The survey instrument looked at variables that could account for employee discontent and mistrust towards the management. = Birth of Care and Growth Model & Schuitema Associates = What emerged from the research was that the variables and managerial behaviours that accounted for minimal work conflict, willingness at work, loyalty and trust towards the management were two: Care and Growth. It was found that the employees who felt the management was genuinely interested in their welfare as individuals and professionals, trusted their immediate supervisors significantly more than the men who believed the management had no interest in this regard. From his research on conflict and trust in management, Schuitema believes that power only becomes legitimate where the leader benevolently exists to provide unconditional care, and fair and honest growth for his/her subordinates. Schuitema Associates was subsequently founded in January 1990 and the Care and Growth Leadership framework was further developed. Schuitema promotes the importance of leadership in empowering employees through genuine care and the creation of growth opportunities and empowerment. Schuitema gives lectures on the Care and Growth material on a regular basis at the Institute for Manufacturing at the University of Cambridge and the Gordon Institute of Business Science in South Africa. = Birth of Intent/Personal Excellence Model = While teaching the Care and Growth Leadership Model to business leaders and educators, Schuitema discovered that personal mastery and successful leadership of others are interlinked.

Geyuan Garden () is located on Dongguan Street in Yangzhou, a city renowned for traditional private gardens, in Jiangsu Province, southeast China. The Geyuan Garden is open to the public, with different sections representing each of the four seasons. Spring is demonstrated with a picture of bamboo and rock. Summer is represented by the steel-grey Taihu stone. Autumn is depicted by Huangshan stone, and winter by Xuan stone.  History  The Geyuan Garden was known as \\"the garden of the long-lived Ganoderma\\" during the Ming Dynasty. In 1818 (the 22nd year of the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor), salt distribution commissioner Huang Zhiyun bought the land and rebuilt the garden as a private retreat. Huang Zhiyun loved bamboo, believing that they were as persistent, modest, straightforward and loyal as a good man. A cluster of three bamboo leaves resemble the Chinese character 个 (pronounced “ge”). This was also noted by Yuan Mei, a writer during the Qing Dynasty: \\"the moonlight made the bamboo shadows hundreds of the character ge\\".

Architecture  Geyuan Garden is known for its seasonal rock gardens, which paint a colourful landscape: \\"the rockery in spring is flamboyant like a bright smile, in summer is verdant like sparkling dewdrops, in autumn is clean like a light makeup, and in winter, it is pale like a sleeping beauty\\".

It is a small, elegant urban wooded mountain garden, primarily made up of bamboo and rocks.

It is housed in the Uffizi, Florence. The painting was required by Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici in 1620 to Thomas Howard, Duke of Arundel, to fill a gap in the family collections. It arrived in Florence in April 1621, when Cosimo had already died. It belongs to Holbein's mature career, and a preparatory drawing of the painting (with the inscription \\"Southwell Knight\\") exists in the Royal Collections of the Windsor Castle. The Louvre houses a copy brought to Paris during the Napoleonic invasions of Europe. Description Richard Southwell was a privy councillor of Henry VIII of England and was portrayed by Holbein, who had become court painter a short time before, in 1536, as recorded in the inscription. The latter reads: Preparatory drawing. The painting had once an ebony frame, of which only the silver decorative medallions remain, with the coats of arms of the Medici, Arundel, Southwell and the painter's name.

A film version, directed by Ping Chong, was broadcast the same year on September 2nd on WGBH in Boston, Massachusetts. http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_272C618289CC4A028CB4D42D94DA167B Inspiration In the late 1970s Monk acquired a turtle named Neutron as a pet, and in 2016 said \\"When I first got her I had a lot of dreams about her, very strange dreams. And then I started thinking, how does a turtle think? What would a turtle mind be, and if she’s sleeping, what would a turtle dream be?\\". In a 2010 interview, Monk said she found standard music concerts boring, and said \\"at that time I started to try to feed in elements to that situation – like one little element of movement. Turtle Dreams is a music piece that has a very simplified movement component. I was working on that music myself, and then I thought ‘wouldn’t it be interesting if the movement had a totally simple counterpoint? So instead of standing there singing, what about if we went from side to side?’ And from there, the piece seemed to make itself.\\". She also added \\"When I was working on it I didn’t realise some things that I see now. There’s a certain fascist element to it, and I wasn’t conscious of that at the time. ... There’s a flatness, a surface style to the people, and maybe a kind of narcissism too.\\" The film version of the piece includes footage of turtles, initially in natural settings and then walking across a world map and through a miniature model of a Western city. This footage was photographed and directed by filmmaker Robert Withers. Reception AllMusic awarded the album four stars, with Ted Mills calling it \\"A daring display of vocal gymnastics and a journey back to childhood when all sounds were wondrous\\".Mills, T. Allmusic Review accessed September 20, 2011 After its premier John Rockwell of the New York Times wrote \\"The effect is rich, enigmatic and compelling.\\" Writing in 2010, Isla Leaver-Yap suggested \\"Turtle Dreams\\" is \\"one of Monk's most aggressive and direct works\\" and comments \\"The proximity of players to audience, and the blank stare that they deliver, push Turtle Dreams into a place of intimate hostility, where the emotional charge does not derive from the content but from the format and tone in the work.\\" In a survey of Monk's work for the newsletter \\"Tusk Is Better Than Rumors\\", the author assesses the different tracks on the album and concludes \\"“Turtle Dreams (waltz)” is the only one that really grabs my attention—“View 1” and “View 2” are both very pretty and “Engine Steps” and “Ester’s Song” are neat little curios, but “Turtle Dreams” itself is an all-timer.\\". At ECM Reviews, Tyran Grillo wrote \\"As with much of Monk’s compositional work, what we get on this CD is only half the journey, complimented as it is by dance and imagery. The brief clips available online don’t seem to do justice to the overall shape and feel of what I am sure is a far more inclusive live experience.\\" In 2020, the YouTube film review channel Red Letter Media found a copy of the WGBH filmed version and featured it on their show Best of the Worst. The group panned it and stated that it was symbolic of the hollow and vapid state of avant garde art.

History Toa Payoh Theatre was one of two cinemas opened for Toa Payoh HDB estate by Eng Wah Organisation in the 1970s, the other being the Kong Chian Cinema which was located near the Toa Payoh Branch Library. It was then being upgraded to the Toa Payoh Entertainment Centre in November 1997 to serve as a leisure space for Toa Payoh residents. The entertainment centre contained three levels, with food restaurants, arcades and Eng Wah ticketing booths occupying the first two levels. Redevelopment In 9 December 2010, the cinema ceased operation together with another Eng Wah's Jubilee Entertainment Centre and was later renovated and converted into a simple shopping mall while the former cinema halls became a large, joint row of shops. In February 2011, Eng Wah sold the entertainment centre to Hersing Pte Ltd for $66 million, and it was subsequently renamed as ERA Centre.

It aired on September 19, 2011. Plot Ted is called in to speak to Barney before his wedding to a mystery bride. Barney wonders if should have gone with \\"the other tie\\", as this is the \\"tie\\" he will have to \\"wear\\" for the rest of his life. Barney fears that this will be the worst wedding of all time. Ted responds by saying that they have already been to the worst wedding ever: Punchy's. In September 2011, the gang attended Punchy's wedding, with Ted as the best man. Ted reveals that he had become infamous for crying each time his high school friends ask him to make a toast at their weddings, so he is determined to make his wedding toast perfect. Meanwhile, Lily and Marshall are not prepared to reveal Lily's pregnancy. At the wedding, Lily gets Marshall to consume all her drinks; Marshall becomes extremely drunk as a result. After seeing all the couples with babies, though, they become convinced that they should reveal Lily's pregnancy to the group. Robin pokes Barney about not calling Nora. Lily realizes that Robin still has feelings for Barney and encourages her to tell him. Robin denies it, and is prepared to tell Barney that there is nothing between them when he pulls her onto the dance-floor, proving Lily right. Barney receives a call from Nora, whom he reveals he actually called multiple times. Robin feeds him the words that she had intended to say to him and Barney succeeds at convincing Nora to meet him again. Ted reveals to Robin that he is losing faith that he will find \\"the one\\", now that all his high- school friends have families he is still alone. Robin convinces Ted not to lose hope. When Marshall and Lily reveal her pregnancy to the group, Ted becomes emotional and cries during his toast. Marshall stands up for Ted, saying that Ted's tears are because he is happy that Lily is pregnant. However, his words are unclear and Punchy's wife Kelly assumes that he is referring to her and reveals that she is also pregnant. Kelly's news causes a fight between Punchy's family and her family (There is a slight inconsistency in that in Sandcastles in the Sand it is heavily implied that Punchy's father died several years earlier. However, when Kelly's father insults Punchy, an older man jumps up and says, \\"You can't talk that way to my son!\\" However, this could simply be Punchy's step-father). Returning to Barney's wedding, Ted assures Barney that he has chosen the right tie when Lily enters the room to inform Ted that Barney's bride-to-be has asked to see him. As Ted leaves the room, Lily questions Barney over the choice of the actual tie he is wearing, making him change. Reception Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode an A, praising the episode as the mark of \\"professionals at work both in front of and behind the camera, demonstrating impeccable timing, delivering moments of real emotion, and never forgetting what makes them funny.\\" References External links * Category:How I Met Your Mother (season 7) episodes Category:2011 American television episodes ","title":"The Best Man (How I Met Your Mother)"},{"id":"33147812","text":"Kerrie Duff (née Engel) (born 1966) is an Australian swimmer and Paralympic bronze medalist. Early life Born in Melbourne with spina bifida, Engel attended Nepean Special School until the end of grade 2, at the age of seven. She then moved to the local primary school at Brandon Park Primary School in 1972 before moving to Brentwood Secondary College. In year 9 she transferred to Korowa Anglican Girls' School. Competitive career In 1981, Engel was one of four Victorians chosen to compete in the First Invitational Junior Games at Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. The other juniors were Peta Jayne Goodwin, Rodney Young and Paul Stitt. When Engel returned to Australia, she had won many medals in swimming events and also track and field. After that, she competed in the Melbourne Senior Nationals and began training a lot more after school. She was coached in swimming at North Lodge Swimming academy under June O'Doherty ('Mrs Boss') and track and field training was overseen by one of the senior Paravics athletes, Ivan Rasojovic. While studying in year 10 she was selected to compete in the FESPIC Games in Sha Tin, Hong Kong. She continued to train at Northlodge during the same era as Greg Fasala who was trained by Jim O'Doherty ('Boss') so the pool deck often held cheering kids watching both overseas athletes do time trials. Two PE teacher students, Paul and Tim Hannon, were the track coaches. At the same time she was coached at Monash University's pool by the Paravics coaches, Greg Frost and then Brian where she met fellow wheelchair sports athletes. Engel swam at the same meet as Fasala when the First Australia Day Games occurred in Melbourne and remembers walking in the parade at the Glass House alongside the 'Mean Machine'. She swam personal bests in freestyle and backstroke (100 m and 100 m) as well as track events, winning bronze and silver medals in swimming at FESPIC Games. Dawn Fraser was the team motivator and Engel recalls the Australian swimmer leading the 'Aussie, Aussie, Aussie' chant in the arena as the team made its entrance. Throughout her career, Engel competed in class 5, though she was borderline class 4, which was apparent when she swam against Sue at the border class between Victoria and South Australia in a few Mount Gambier competitions. The highlight of Engel's swimming career was representing Australia at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. She won bronze in the 400 m Freestyle event in a personal best time of 7.11 in Class 5. As a result of this, she represented students on Monash University's Sports And Recreation Association Executive between 1984-1989 whilst undertaking her Bachelor of Arts. She was awarded a Full Blue in 1984 and inducted into the Monash University Hall of Fame in 2005. Overall Engel competed in four Senior National Games in the years 1981, 1984, 1986 and 1988. After the Paralympics Engel received special permission to join Northlodge A.U.S.S.I. when she was 23 although people generally needed to be over 30 to swim in MASTERS. She swam in a number of short and long meets with the Northlodge Neptune team. Engel also had fun sharing her swimming skills by training Paravics' juniors, and playing a little bit of wheelchair tennis (in Frankston) and basketball (at Preston) but was happier in the pool. Her team contained other notable Paralympic swimmers such as Anne Currie, who was also in the 1984 Paralympics, but competed on Long Island. Although born with spina bifida, Engel swam against other athletes with paralysis and spinal injuries such as polio and cerebral palsy. She was Team Captain in the Perth Nationals. In 1991, Engel received a Bachelor of Arts from Monash University. She returned to competitive swimming in 1994 while working at World Vision Australia to swim in Beijing's FESPIC Games and was pleased with swimming comparative and faster times to her 1983 personal best. She came away with 2 Gold and one Silver. In 1999, she co-wrote the book Challenge and Hope: Disability, Disease and Trauma in the Developing World with Jill Burn. Engel is married and lives in Western Australia. In 2014 she graduated with a Masters in Human Rights from Curtin University.She gained her Cert IV TAE and runs Kerrie Duff Consulting . In her spare time Engel enjoys sharing her life experiences at community events such as 2016 Anti Poverty Week or 2017 TedxPerth as a Living Book through The Human Library project.

Biography St Cecilia He studied under Kugelgen in Dresden, but went in 1823 to Italy and took up his quarters in Rome, where he followed, as a nondescript in life and art, his own peculiar style of colouring. In his desire to attain the charm of the colours of the great Venetians, a very faded picture of that school led him to the conviction that they painted their pictures entirely in grey before putting on the bright colours.

Much of his work has concentrated on the history of Australia's engagement with Asia and, in particular, the ways in which Australians imagined Asian peoples and their cultures. =Anxious Nation= The results of his research on Asia were published as Anxious Nation: Australia and the Rise of Asia 1850–1939 in 1999. This landmark work explores the anxiety that Australians felt towards the people of Asia during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. While Australian images of Australia were overwhelmingly negative during this period, Walker makes the point that some Australians including Prime Minister Alfred Deakin saw much to admire in Asian cultures. Al Grassby, former Minister for Immigration who dismantled the White Australia Policy, described the book as \\"evocative and compelling prose …which shows how bigotry and myth making shaped the question of race which dominated the public and private discourse.\\" Anxious Nation has been reprinted in an India edition and translated into Chinese. =Not Dark Yet= In late 2004, David Walker, suffered a sudden and severe loss of sight that rendered him legally blind and limited his ability to continue archival research. He subsequently changed his research methods and drew on his family history as a tool to investigate the development of Australia’s national character and culture. This led to the publication of Not Dark Yet: A personal history which has been described by Phillip Adams as \\"an evocative portrait of 20th century Australia …the attitudes, idiosyncrasies and prejudices of the era.\\" =Stranded Nation= Stranded Nation: White Australia in an Asian Region is the sequel to \\"Anxious Nation\\" published by UWAP in 2019. Drawing on a wide variety of resources including archival records, literature and personal stories,this volume covers the evolution of Australia's engagement with Asia in the period of World War II and into the 1970s. This period saw Australia as a ‘white’ nation, with deep anxieties about Asia, seeking to convince both itself and its neighbours that it belonged within the Asian region. As Britain’s withdrew to Europe, Australia found an urgent need to come to an accommodation with Asia resulting in a desire for a greater understanding of the \\"Asian Psyche\\" and a gradual breaking down of the White Australia Policy. Other work Walker has co- edited Australia’s Asia: from Yellow Peril to Asian Century a selection of essays on the Australian engagement with Asia which was released in late 2012. In January 2013, Walker also published a collection of essays entitled Encountering Turbulence: Asia in the Australian Imaginary. BHP Billiton Chair of Australian Studies In November 2012, Walker was appointed as the inaugural BHP Billiton Professor in Australian Studies at Peking University. The chair was an initiative of the Australia-China Council, the Foundation for Australian Studies in China, BHP Billiton, Peking University and the Australian Department of Industry and was the first high-profile, privately funded Australian professorial position in China. In announcing Professor Walker's appointment, the Australian Minister for Trade, Craig Emerson said that the chair was an indication of the Australian government's commitment to encouraging Australia students to look to Asia as their future. It was consistent with the government response to the \\"Australia in the Asian Century White Paper\\", which aimed to have more Australian university students studying overseas and a greater proportion undertaking part of their degree in an Asian country by 2025. Emerson praised Walker as an outstanding ambassador for Australian education who would engage with Chinese researchers, students, government and the community to lift the profile of studies of Australian society, history and culture. Walker would also provide academic leadership to a network of more than 30 Australian Studies Centres in Chinese universities, which has been supported by the Australia-China Council for two decades. Professor Walker retired from the Chair in 2016 but has continued to support Australian Studies Centres throughout China. Awards and fellowships The Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia elected Walker a fellow in 2001 and the Australian Academy of the Humanities bestowed the same honor in 2005. He received the Ernest Scott prize following the publication of Anxious Nation. In April 2012, Walker became the Alfred Deakin Professor of Australian Studies, the highest honour that Deakin University can bestow on its academic staff. Walker was awarded Membership of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2018 Queen's Birthday honours.

The snow – white temple with five gold domes in the Ukrainien Baroque style meets guests at the entrance to Chernihiv. It is one of the tourist objects of the reserve “Ancient Chernihiv“. St. Catherine's Church was built in the cossacks period. It has its own story based on real events. The temple was erected in honor of Chernihiv regiment of Cossacks who had shown the heroism and bravery during the storming of the Turkish fortress of Azov. Architecture and History The church is made of bricks, it is cross - shaped, nine - fraction, five – dome. The composition is centrical, pyramidally built with the highest central dome and lower ones – over the faceted sleeves of architectural cross. So its composition reminds a wooden. Ukrainian church with five octahedral capacities – octahedrons each crowned with dome combined in on plastic unity. Thanks to such pyramidal construction the church looks tender, elegant and solemn. The facades are a characteristic feature of the church. The main role in their decoration is played by portal and windows margins: triangular pediments, frames, shallow – cut cornices. Modelled ornamentation is not used in the church, common and circle brick which replaced plinth is used both as building and ornamental material. The facades are plastered and limed The characteristic feature of the interior is its opening upwards. It is a five – chamber pillarless temple crowded by five domes. The top is designed in traditional Ukrainian style – with fractures. The walls are white washed. The domes and crosses are gilded. This monument to the past is located in the central part of historic town near the Dytynets and Kyiv – Chernihiv motorway. It is one of the leading architectural dominants of the city. It was built in honor of heroism of Chernihiv regiment Cossacks showed up during the assault of Turkish fortress Azov in 1696 under the commandment of Chernihiv colonel Yakiv Lyzohub. The church was sacrified in 1715 in honor of St. – Catherine, who had been respected in Ukraine for a long time. St. Catherine's Church hasn't had great changing. In 1837 the narthex was built to the western façade of the church and the bell tower was erected in 1908 and both were taken apart during the restoration. It suffered losses in 1941 – 1943 ( roofs and tops of domes were burnt ). The restoration works were conducted into 2 phases : 1947 – 1955 and 1975 – 1980. St. – Catherine's church in Chernihiv is the greatest monument of Ukrainian (Cossack) renaissance of the 17th – 18th centuries, which has authentically remained, it produced a decisive influence on the development of Ukrainian church architecture of the 18th century and it still plays the role of city building dominant of the historical party of the town. In spring 1990 the group Cossacks, Chernihiv inhabitants, full of initiative renewed their activity suppressed by the Soviet authorities in 1933. In 1992 the Cossacks orthodox community of St. Catherine’ Church was officially registered by the State and in 1994 recognized as “a successor of the appropriate right and duties“ of the previous community (art. 1 of Community Status). On April 2, 1995 the Cossacks orthodox community was taken under the protection of the most holy patriarch of Kyiv and all Rus–Ukraine Volodymyr (Romaniuk), (art. 1 Community Status). According to the order of the Chairman of the public administration of Chernigiv region M. Lavrik from April 5, 2006, the cult building was transferred to the possession of St. Catherine’ s Church Cossacks Orthodox community. On May 22, 2008, Saint Nicolas’ Day, according to the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal of Ukraine, the legality of transferring St. Catherine's Church to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchy was confirmed. On July 19, 2008, the Cossacks Orthodox Community with the chairman of the parish council and the Bishop of Chernihiv and Nizhin at the head of, entered the Church and renewed the public worship after 75 years of prohibition. From then on, Church has become the Cossacks Cathedral of Chernihiv eparchy. The solemn canonization of the Reverend Mercury, Father Superior Bragynski took place in St. Catherine's Cathedral on December 7, 2011. The ceremony was headed by the most holy Patriarch of Kyiv and all Rus - Ukraine Filaret. The relic shrine of saint's body has become one of the sacred objects. The Cathedral parishioners actively supported the Euromaїdan in 2013, the Revolution of Dignity 2014 year and volunteer movement helping to regenerate the Ukrainian Army. The names of more than one hundred donators who had rendered material and financial assistance, participated in person were entered in the cathedral synodic list. With a direct participation of the archipriest Eugen (Orda) and the Chairman of parish council the help was rendered to the Kyiv Maїdan and the zone of hostilities (antiterrorist operation).

Conflicts around Church  Apart from Kyiv patriarchy, the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine had a claim of the Cossacks St. Catherine's Church. So far as the premises were transferred exactly to the community of Kyiv Patriarchy, the representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine set up “ a camp church “ in the shape of a tarpaulin marquee at the walls of the building. After the Revolution of Dignity the marquee was dismantled on February 21, 2014 by the believers of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine under pressure of Chernigiv community.

In modern times, blue calico is used to make daily clothes, mosquito nets, pillowcases, baggage cloth, etc. The blue and white printed calico was first worn by local farmers and fishermen. Among Nantong citizens, it is famous for its handmade printing and dying process, as well as the native and simple design. The patterns on the blue clothes originate from animals, plants, and fairy tales, and are used to express the good wishes for the future.  Printing and Dyeing Skill  The most typical feature is its design: blue background with white flowers or white background with blue flowers. The folk techniques maintained the traditional process for hundreds of years. A series of complicated processes is needed to produce blue calico, including selecting cotton material, soaking in water, gluing the template, dyeing, cleaning, and sunning. The pattern to be dyed must be cut into paper template, which is then covered in tung oil, dried, and glued to the fabric.  Historical Evolution During Song (song 宋) Dynasties, blue calico was called Yaoban Cloth(yào bān bù 药斑布), and during Ming (míng 明) and Qing (qīng 清) Dynasties, it was called Jiaohua Cloth (jiāo huā bù 浇花布). The patterns on blue calico are all from civil society, and they reflect the experiences of the common people. With the development of the textile technology during Qing Dynasty, there were large quantities of dyeing and weaving workshops. Legend  Due to the long history of traditional manual printing and dyeing, a legend surrounds Nantong blue calico. The legend said Mei fell in the mud coloring his clothes yellow. The yellow color was difficult to wash out, but many residents found it attractive. So he told his good friend Ge this accident. They specialized in this yellow-stained cloth, but realized that the color faded quickly. However, when they hung the cloth out to dry on a tree, it was blown to a clump of indigo grass, which dyed the cloth blue. Mei and Ge learned how to use the grass to dye fabric blue.  Museum  In order to preserve and develop this art, Nantong Blue Calico Art Gallery was set up in 1996 near Haohe River (濠河) by Wu Yuanxin (吴元新). One thousand antique blue calicoes and drawings were collected here. In addition, the traditional hand-making process is shown in the art gallery.

It is based on the character Pumuckl, created by children's book author Ellis Kaut.  Plot  The master carpenter Eder meets the Kobold Pumuckl, whom only Eder can see, because Pumuckl becomes invisible when other people approach. Pumuckl finally stays with Eder in his carpenter's shop, and maintains a fatherly and friendly relationship with Eder.  Background  * 1982/1983 the first season of the series was broadcast at Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Television), from September 24 and in Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen (First German Television), from September 26 consisting of 26 half-hour episodes. * Between the production of the two seasons director of the first Pumuckl season and co-screenwriter Ulrich König created the Bogeyman Hatschipuh, a character which resembles Pumuckl (also in optical appearance) but has striking green instead of red hair, and whose name has also been taken from a Pumuckl screenplay. * 1988/1989 followed a second season consisting of 26 all new episodes. Some differences between the first and the second season are notable e.g. Eder's carpenter's shop is now yellow on the outside and Pumuckl throws episode titles in the air. * The theme was co-created by famous German musician Howard Carpendale. * Since its original airing the series has been rerun various programs of the ARD. * Many well- known German actors such as Willy Harlander, Ilse Neubauer, Erni Singerl, Toni Berger, Wolfgang Völz and Helga Feddersen had recurring appearances. The one- time guest appearances e.g. Lisa Fitz, Gisela Uhlen, Helmut Fischer, Barbara Valentin, Gaby Dohm, Klaus Schwarzkopf, Georg Thomalla, Wilfried Klaus, Barbara Rudnik, Iris Berben, Fredl Fesl, Karl Dall and Rolf Zacher were quite notable for a children's series. * The show was directed by Ulrich König. The character Pumuckl was animated by Hungarian Pannonia Film Studio. * Shooting location was a fictional workshop in the building Widenmayerstraße 2 in Altstadt-Lehel in Munich. The building has since been demolished. * The cinematic movie Pumuckl und der blaue Klabauter (Pumuckl and the blue Klabauter) had already been produced when, in 1999, the series was revived using the new title Pumuckls Abenteuer (Pumuckl's Adventures).

The story revolves around Annemarie Braun, who is called Nesthäkchen, the youngest child of a doctor's family. Annemarie grows up with her brothers Hans and Klaus in Berlin during the imperial era shortly before the First World War.Melissa Eddy. Overlooked No More: Else Ury’s Stories Survived World War II. She Did Not. NY Times July 10, 2019 Story Nesthäkchen (Kathrin Toboll) and her family from the 1983 ZDF series The television series starts in Berlin in the early 20th century. Dr. Ernst Braun is a respected doctor. He and his wife Elsbeth have a Prussian marriage and educate their children in the virtues of the imperial era. Annemarie is the youngest of the three children (two older sons) and is the darling of the father, who is quite caring. The family lives in a spacious apartment in Charlottenburg. Charlottenburg Palace forms the title motif of the opening credits. Other family members are the grandma, the nanny Lena, and household servants. Annemarie has a happy childhood with all the benefits of the upper middle class. She has many dolls, and her father lets her frequently misbehave. For example, she often uses the swear word \\"Donnerknispel\\" without being scolded. One day, when she throws her father's new barometer off the wall, her father forgives her; instead of punishing her, he explains to Annemarie how the instrument works. A holiday with her uncle Heinrich and Aunt Käthe on a farm in Bavaria is also portrayed. Afterwards, the rural influence on the children is obvious. Mother soon restores proper behavior. Annemarie's friend and nanny Lena sleeps in Annemarie's room. After Annemarie disobediently walks on the street with other children and even gets into trouble in a simple Berlin backyard, Lena recommends sending Annemarie to a kindergarten. In kindergarten, Annemarie is the smartest of the children, who all come from upscale homes. Later, at grade school, Annemarie is the best pupil, which especially pleases her father. Her report card prompts her father to praise her. In her schooldays Annemarie gets scarlet fever and travels to Amrum for a cure in a children's sanitorium. There she experiences adventures with the dangerous Wadden Sea and the kind-hearted sanitorium director Mrs. Clarsen, a captain's widow. During Annemarie's stay, the First World War breaks out, and she returns to Berlin with great difficulty. A happy reunion ensues, but the advent of the World War has a tragic effect on the family: The older brother wants to volunteer for the navy. Dr Braun wears the field-gray coat of a medical officer under his doctor's white coat. The story continues in Ury's books, which recount almost all of Annemarie's life: her teenage years, her university studies, her marriage, and even her first great- grandchild.Jennifer Redmann.

History  The temple is owned by a single private owner and it is currently being looked after by Sri Sudarsana Panda and his family members, his lives in Kedar Gouri chowk, Old Town, Bhubaneswar. Because of the features like the graha architrave, which is carved with eight grahas; pabhaga with three mouldings of khura, kumbha, pata, which have archaic features it is believed that it was established in the 8th century AD.  Architecture  It is a REKHA DEUL type of temple building but now the superstructure has no existence.  Significance  Bhauma-Kara rule is a historic significance of this temple besides this numerous cultural significance like Sivaratri, Kartika purnima and Sankranti are observed in this temple.  Architecture  * Surrounding: The temple is within a compound made of dressed laterite blocks. The compound wall measures 32.00 metres in length, 16.60 metres in breadth and 2.00398 metres in height with an average thickness of 0.30 metres.

There is an ancient well made of laterite block in the southeastern corner of the temple at a distance of 6.00 metres from the vimana. The face of the well measures 2.60 square metres. * Orientation:This temple Faces towards east. * Architectural features (Plan and Elevation): At present, the temple stands on a low square platform measuring 3.50 square metres with a height of 0.45 metres. On plan, the temple has a vimana, measuring three square metres. The sanctum measuring 1.90 square metres, which is 0.20 metres below the present platform. The vimana is triratha on plan as distinguished by a central raha and a pair of kanika pagas on either side of the raha on all the four sides. On elevation, the temple has a renovated bada sealed by stones that measures 5.20 metres from khura moulding to the half of the gandi. From bottom to the top, the temple has a bada, while the mastaka is absent. On elevation, the bada measuring 2.20 metres has threefold division namely pabhaga (0.65 metres), jangha(1.30 metres), baranda(0.25 metres). At the base, the pabhaga has three mouldings comprising khura, kumbha, and pata, which are not a developed one. The remaining part of the reconstructed superstructure measures 3 metres. * Raha niche & Parsva devata: The raha niche on three sides uniformly measures 0.85 metres in height, 0.45 metres in width, and 0.24 metres in depth and are occupied by smaller images of the recent times.

In the centre of the chaitya motifs are a female figure in padmasana and a human head in succession. The baranda with a single moulding is relieved by the carvings of scroll works, recess and false perforated windows. Line drawings of the chaitya motifs and scroll work are noticed in the temple stones, which suggest that carvings in the temples are done after the structure is erected. * Door Jamb:The doorjamb measuring 1.80 metres in height and 1.15 metres in width is decorated with scroll works. At the base of the doorjamb, there are dvarapala niches enshrining Saivite dvarapalas.

Skidmore was heavily influenced by Gothic Revival style, a movement characterised by its use of medieval designs and styles. He was a member of both the Oxford Architectural Society and the Ecclesiological Society, two organisations which endorsed the Gothic Revival style. Skidmore also worked closely with architect Sir George Gilbert Scott.  Early life and work  Francis Alfred Skidmore was born in Birmingham, the son of Francis Skidmore, a jeweller. The Skidmore family moved to Coventry around 1822, possibly because Coventry was an important watchmaking centre. Skidmore learned metalworking from his father and completed a seven-year apprenticeship with him. In 1845, father and son registered as silversmiths under the name F. Skidmore and son. Their early work as silversmiths consisted primarily of church plate. The earliest known examples of Skidmore's work includes three silver chalices made for St John the Baptist Church, Coventry (1845), St Giles' Church, Exhall (1845) and St Alkmund's Church, Derby (1846).  Development of Skidmore's work  The 1850s were an important period in the development and expansion of Skidmore's career as a metalworker and craftsman. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, he exhibited church plate, including a silver gilt and enamelled chalice now on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The recognition he received at the Exhibition helped to stimulate his business and he soon expanded, beginning to produce other church furnishings including items in iron, brass and wood. In 1851, he also received commissions to produce gas lighting in St Michael's Church, Coventry. Skidmore's firm also installed gas lighting in St Mary's Guildhall and Holy Trinity Church, both also in Coventry. At Holy Trinity Church, some of his ironwork, wooden pews and gas lamp standards are still in situ. It was also in the 1850s that Skidmore met Sir George Gilbert Scott, a prominent architect, designer and proponent of Gothic Revival. Although Skidmore produced works for a variety of people, it was his long lasting, working relationship with Scott which resulted in several notable commissions. Skidmore worked with Scott on the Lichfield, Hereford and Salisbury cathedral screens and the Albert Memorial in London.  Later life  Near the end of his life, Skidmore's eyesight began to deteriorate and he was disabled after being hit by a carriage in London. His final years were spent in poverty in Eagle Street, Coventry. Skidmore died on 13 November 1896 and was buried in London Road Cemetery, Coventry. He was survived by his widow, Emma, and their four children: Francis Sidney, Bernard, Evangeline and Kenneth. In 2000, a memorial plaque was installed at the site of Skidmore's Alma Street factory in Hillfields.  Major works  Hereford Screen, 1862, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and made by Francis SkidmoreDuring his lifetime, Francis Skidmore created works for 24 cathedrals, over 300 parish churches, 15 colleges and a number of public buildings. Skidmore, Families of the Bl ack Country and Birmingham 1600–1900 Some of his more prominent works are detailed below. = Cathedral screens =  Lichfield  Between 1855 and 1861 Sir George Gilbert Scott restored parts of Lichfield Cathedral. Francis Skidmore and John Birnie Philip produced the new Victorian metal screen designed by Scott.  Worcester  Between 1864 and 1874 Sir George Gilbert Scott did extensive work in Worcester cathedral, mainly in the choir. Part of this was to commission a screen from Skidmore, installed in 1873 and still in place. It is rather less elaborate than the ones at Hereford and Lichfield.  Hereford  The Hereford Screen was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and made by Francis Skidmore. It was made in a period of only four months. To complete such a large and complex structure in only four months, Skidmore took 'short cuts' and used mass production techniques. Skidmore displayed it at the International Exhibition of 1862 where it won a medal for its superior design and craftsmanship. The screen was dismantled and removed from the cathedral in 1967. The Herbert Art Gallery & Museum in Coventry purchased the screen, but was unable to restore or display it, so in 1983 it was transferred to the Victoria and Albert Museum. Before conservation, the screen was in almost 14,000 individual pieces, many of which were in very poor condition. Conservation of the screen took thirteen months and cost over £800,000 which is, as of September 2011, the largest conservation project undertaken by the V&A.; The Hereford Choir Screen is now on display at the V&A.;  Salisbury  Sir George Gilbert Scott led the restoration of Salisbury Cathedral between 1863 – 1878. It was during this time that Skidmore created the cathedral's choir screen. In 1959, the screen was removed and most of it was destroyed. The chancel gates survived and are now in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. As of September 2011, they are on display in the Ironwork gallery, room 114a.

IMT School was founded in 2005 under the name IMT Institute for Advanced Studies. The acronym IMT stands for \\"Institutions, Markets, Technologies.\\" Its main campus is located in the San Francesco Complex within the historic city walls of Lucca. As an institute for advanced studies, IMT School hosts researchers who carry out methodological research, held to high scientific standards, leading to the development of new knowledge. IMT School's specially designed campus fosters the continual presence of visiting scholars that contribute to creating a stimulating and intellectually lively environment. At the same time, IMT School is also an institute of technology where numerous research projects are undertaken to apply cutting-edge scientific results to solve problems of economic, industrial, and societal interest. IMT School's institutional role is also that of a graduate school where knowledge is transmitted to PhD students. Although the school is relatively young, it has already attracted significant attention from national and international media. Its international advisory board includes a number of prominent scientists, including H. Eugene Stanley, Sanjoy K. Mitter and Gerard Roland.The school consistently performs well in international and Italian research rankings. For several years, it has been ranked as a top school in economics and statistics in Italy and one of the top research institutions in Europe and the world, established post-1980. History The desire of the city of Lucca to have its own university dates back to 1369, when Emperor Charles IV gave an official dispensation to the Republic of Lucca to establish a \\"Studium Generale\\" in the city. In 1387 this concession was countersigned and confirmed by Pope Urban VI, yet despite these attempts, the university never succeeded and eventually failed. A second attempt to establish a University of Lucca was made in 1785 and was slightly more successful offering courses in Law, Medicine, Mathematics, Engineering and Philosophy. This university was reformed during the Duchy of Maria Luisa of Spain, where it became the \\"Real Liceo\\" however the history of the Real Liceo was interrupted in 1847, following the incorporation of the Duchy of Lucca into the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1847, disappearing definitively in 1867 shortly before the completion of the Risorgimento. IMT thus represents the third attempt to found a university in Lucca and was established by ministerial decree in November 2005 as an Institute for Advanced Studies.https://www.imtlucca.it/en/the-imt-school/overview Academics The multidisciplinary PhD program of IMT School, integrates scientific competences of economics, engineering, computer science, physics, applied mathematics, statistics, history and sciences of cultural heritage.

It aired in 1984 on ZDF, co- produced with UFA and Imagion AG. Thirteen 25 minute episodes were produced, directed by Franz Josef Gottlieb. The music for the series was composed by Birger Heymann. Plot One day, Jarl-Kulle Düwel wins a holiday for two on the Baltic Sea in a competition. After some thought Jarl-Kulle decides to give this prize to his parents so that they can take a break from the stress of everyday life. The hotel package includes a health spa with all the extras. Perfect for Beate and Walter Düwel, who is the music director of the Berlin Opera, to escape the hustle and bustle for once. Charged with looking after her younger siblings is Heide, who is almost eighteen years old. In addition Grandma Düwel occasionally keeps an eye on the children. In order to ensure the children are catered for, the parents leave behind sufficient housekeeping money for three weeks. However, the children come up with another plan; they decide to use this large amount of money to buy all the wonderful things that they have always wanted. And to keep meal costs down, they plan just to eat ravioli. So for example, Jarl-Kulle, who sees himself as a budding bestselling writer, buys himself a typewriter, whilst Branca gets herself a complete roller hockey kit and starts to train hard. For a couple of days the ravioli experiment goes well, but gradually the boring menu gets on the children's nerves. Because they have spent almost all their money, they have to come up with something else. So they organise, for example, a \\"pot luck party\\". Cute, little Pepe, the baby of the family, shows great imagination and quickly becomes friends with the owner of the sausage stall in the street. Meanwhile, Jarl-Kulle chats up one girl after another in the hope that she will cook for him and his siblings. Before long he gets the nickname \\"Ravioli Casanova\\". Life without their parents proves to be increasingly difficult as time goes by. Chaos breaks out time and again and accidents, like the flooding dishwasher or exploding kettle, eventually lead to a partial redecoration of the flat. But, fortunately, for such cases, Max-Leo, the devoted boyfriend of elder sister, Heide, is always on hand. Mrs Nettelbeck, the Düwel's neighbour proves to be just as helpful. The parents spend their holiday a little differently than planned. Walter Düwel does not bother with going to the beach or even playing any sport. He is at loggerheads with Dr. Klotz, the female doctor, and Lorchen, the room maid, who rail against his constant escapades and especially his heavy smoking. Whilst his wife is busy playing sport, Düwel works on his new symphony. As it soon turns out, not without success. A running gag in the series is the wardrobe which constantly collapses.

The last episode was screened on 4 March 1990. The subject of the series is the story of a fictional family of miners in the Ruhr area over a period of about 70 years between the end of the 19th and the mid 20th century, against the background of the history of the German Empire from the Empire to the Weimar Republic to the end of the Nazi dictatorship . The shooting took place in the studios and on the grounds of the Bavaria-Film am Geiselgasteig near Munich. The elaborately designed exterior backdrops stood until 1996.

First as a tug, later as a hawker, Bruno finds the work hoped for and witnesses the events surrounding the Siegfried colliery before the turn of the century. He marries Pauline, the daughter of the miner Friedrich Bötzkes. His son Karl developed into a Social Democrat in the imperial era, overran his father and leaves the family. He becomes union official and finally member of the Reichstag, Bruno is critical of the activities of the Social Democrats and can not be taken. He is drafted into the First World War, but is not called back from the front for mining. Bruno's wife Pauline sympathizes with the Social Democrats and the Spartacists during the war, which Bruno does not really support, but does not refuse. At the end of this first part of the saga, the emperor abdicated and the miners, among them Bruno and his friend, the miner Otto Schablowski, occupy the mine and demand their nationalization. That they could not prevail with this is only hinted at in the cinematic presentation. =Red Earth II= Max Kruska, son of Bruno Kruska, experiences the depression and - also his own - unemployment after the First World War. The Siegfried colliery is occupied by Frenchmen and the coal mining primarily serves the reparation. Max is impressed by the promises of the National Socialists and Adolf Hitler and enters the NSDAP. At the colliery, where Max could invest again, the progress has arrived. But Max's doubts come from National Socialist Germany; When his uncle Karl and his brother-in-law Richard are imprisoned, he turns away from the formerly supported policy. From then on he supports the forced laborers who are under him underground and hopes the war will end soon. But the assassination of a young Russian forced laborer at the mine, which Max has witnessed, further intensifies his anger towards the regime. After all, Max, together with his brother-in-law Richard, who has since been released from custody, prevents the Siegfried von der Wehrmacht colliery from being destroyed at the end of the war. The story ends with the colliery being shut down a few years later for economic reasons and the winding tower blown up.

He and fellow miner, Friedrich Boetzkes get trapped, but both are safely rescued after hours of work. He calls for an improvement in working conditions and reluctantly supports the other mates' strikes. He sees in a common interest group of all coal miners in the district (union) an easy target for the employers' associations, which is why the workers should organize himself in his opinion, only in their own company. His friend Herbert Boetzkes is shot by Steiger Bärwald during the strike, Bruno gets revenge on Steiger, later to overthrow and kill him. Later his military service, he marries Pauline Botzkes, causing problems, since he himself is Protestant, while Pauline is Catholic. Later they have a son 'Max' and a daughter 'Franziska'.

After World War I, he returns to mining which is operated by the military. In the 2nd season, he is in the infirmary of the mine to cure his lung cancer. His friend Otto died, he had to identify the copse. He claims to have lied to his son and the other buddies that his corpse was not his best friend's. He gets caught in a mine accident and is buried. His son Max and his friend Jupp Kowalla rescue him, but he dies due to his injuries. His funeral procession is abruptly interrupted as a demonstration march of anti-fascist action by members of the Sturmabteilung under the leadership of Revier Martin Stanek. * Otto Schablowski (Ralf Richter) - son of Pomeranian farmers, but has been working as a miner for some time. He becomes Bruno's best friend and teaches to be a miner. He is one of the spokesmen during the strike. When the families run out of money to buy food during the strike, Otto gives away his accumulated savings so that the strike does not stop.

He goes through various political strifes but when he supports Rewandowski during the war according to the attitude of his party, instead of campaigning for peace, he loses all the consent of his constituents. In the 2nd season, (now played by Alexander Wagner), he calls for increased cooperation of workers and mine operators to tackle together against the unjust coal claims of the French. Although, since the end of the war, he has increasingly lost his reputation with his old mining buddies, because they feel neglected by him and see their interests are no longer perceived.

During the war he becomes a delivery driver, then miner. He befriends the prisoner of war Maurice, who is later to be accused of being a saboteur. Max becomes Käthe's lover even after the war. Because of the personal hardships, Max tries to assassinate Emperor Wilhelm II with a molotov cocktail but is stopped by Bruno.

Since the Ruhr area only half belonged to Westphalia administratively (as the title 'Rote Erde' indicates), the Siegfried colliery must be located in the northeastern district. The chaplain comments on his sentencing to Werden as saying that he should \\"get as far away as possible\\", which confirms this somewhat. In episode 2, on the occasion of the election of the strike delegates, instead of fictional mines (\\"Hermine II\\", \\"Cäcilie\\", \\"Karl August\\", etc.) real mines are mentioned: \\"Wilhelmine Viktoria\\",Franz Kurowski and \\"Count Bismarck\\" are located in Gelsenkirchen, \\" Bonifacius \\" in Essen. In the second season, a few statements and signs indicate where the colliery is located: The inhabitants see and hear the explosion of the ammunition depot that Otto blew up, which according to Max is located in Haßlinghausen . Later, a sister of the Caritas Hattingen office (as it says on her coach) delivers laundry and hidden communist leaflets to the Kruska family from. Together with Rewandowski's statement that the Siegfried colliery is already more than 100 years old (at the beginning of the 19th century the Ruhr mining industry concentrated on the last mentioned cities), the area of today's Ennepe-Ruhr district appears to be the most likely place of action. On a sign at the restaurant is a beer brewery from Dortmund to read. The newspaper, which is read by Friedrich Boetzkes, is called 'Tremonia', which is the Latin name for the city of Dortmund. The constituency winner of the 1912 Reichstag election, Karl Boetzkes, is indeed a fictional character, but has a similar life as the actual Wahlkreissieger (election district winner) Max King (about the life data, the craft work at a young age and the rise to the trade unionist).Jens Hahnwald: Max König.

The only other constituency winner of the SPD in the Ruhr area was that year the dentist and writer August Erdmann in the constituency of Dortmund - Hörde . The conveyor tower in the first season has a clear similarity to an early photograph of the Hibernia colliery from the 1850s, as it is printed in the WAZ Chronicle of the Ruhr (1987). Such scaffolding was around 1887, when the action of the series begins, of course, long outdated and almost nowhere in use.

A 70-year-old poet falls in love with a high school girl and is inspired to write a short story about her, but his star student, who is jealous of the relationship, steals his literary work. Plot Lee Jeok-yo (Park Hae-il) is a respected national poet in his 70s. His thirty-something assistant Seo Ji-woo (Kim Mu-yeol) recently published his first book, described as a genre novel with psychological insight, and it has shot to the top of the bestseller lists. Finding a young high schoolgirl, Eun-gyo (Kim Go-eun), asleep on a chair on his porch, Jeok-yo, instantly enamored, agrees to give her a part-time job cleaning his home. As Jeok-yo spends more time in Eun-gyo's company, long-lost feelings are awakened within him, and her exuberance, sense of fun, and genuine warmth towards him make him see himself as the young man he used to be. His love and need for her grow not only because he finds her incredibly beautiful, but also because of how she makes him feel. Deeply smitten, Jeok-yo begins to write a short story about his imagined sexual relationship with the young woman. However, as the two get ever closer, Ji-woo condemns their relationship as inappropriate and repugnant, and he steals the short story to publish under his own name.

Park said, \\"I've never been this excited for a film adaptation of my work. I'm thrilled because this novel is based on my own personal thoughts as I grew older. It's a very special piece of mine, and I trusted director Jung's caliber of delving into human psychology and desire.\\" Park visited the film crew twice during the production of the movie, and presented autographed copies of his novel to the leading actors and actresses. Director Jung Ji-woo said he chose Park Hae-il for the role, instead of an older actor, for a specific reason, saying, \\"This movie deals with what it is like to age, and what it is like to want something when you've lost your youth. I thought that the theme would be delivered more effectively when such a role is given to an actor who is much younger.\\" Before shooting, Park visited Pagoda Park to observe elderly men, and went through hours of discussion with the director to perfect his character. Jung praised Park's \\"incredible tolerance,\\" undergoing eight hours of special make-up daily and learning the weary gait and gesture of a man in his 70s. Kim Go-eun was a drama major at Korea National University of Arts who had never appeared in a film or TV series before, not even in a minor role, having only previously acted in student productions or school plays. She met Jung in 2011 through a circle of friends and was not even aware that auditions for the film were being held. \\"I ended up having an audition after chatting with the director. There wasn't even any time for me to prepare,\\" Kim recalled. She was chosen among some 300 actresses who auditioned to play the role of innocent yet sensual Eun-gyo. Looking for an actress that \\"had to be ordinary and alive at the same time,\\" Jung said he decided on Kim \\"by discussing the book and her personal thoughts about Eun-gyo [...] What I liked about Go-eun was that she didn't try to impress me at all. She didn't try to please anybody. She didn't try to look pretty in front of the camera. She was just herself. That's what drew me to her.\\" He flatteringly said she was similar to his previous Happy End leading lady, acclaimed actress Jeon Do- yeon. Novelist Park Bum-shin agreed that she was right for the role upon meeting her, saying, \\"She was perfect for the forever virgin and forever young image that Eun-gyo symbolizes.\\" Kim said of her film debut, \\"It took a lot of courage to play this role. [...] I don't think physical beauty alone could have unleashed so much passion in a man who had lived for over 70 years with a heart of a stone. Eun-gyo is very spontaneous and is too innocent to have thought about the consequences of what she is doing, but she also has a mature side. She lacks parental care and love, so she desires this from a surrogate father figure, and becomes obsessed with the idea.\\" Co-star Park Hae-il described her as \\"fresh, dreamy and attractive. Kim Go-eun is Eun-gyo.\\" The last line of the character, who is also a victim of domestic violence, was written by Jung, and does not exist in the novel. \\"I never knew how pretty I was (until I met you),\\" Eun-gyo tells the poet. Jung said, \\"It’s really about a young girl's journey learning about herself and her own worth. I wanted to capture the moments when she realizes how precious she is to herself and to others.\\" Reception Upon its release the film attracted some controversy for its depiction of sex between a 70-year-old man and a high school-aged girl. The film opened on April 25, 2012 and notched 630,000 admissions in its first week. Overall, the film has sold 1,343,916 tickets.Wheeler, CJ (11 August 2012). \\"HanCinema's Film Review: Scandalous Desires & Social Taboos in Jeong Ji-woo's A Muse\\". Hancinema. Retrieved 2013-02-10.

She was the only woman among the casualties of the Old Location uprising in Windhoek on 10 December 1959. Since Namibia's independence on 21 March 1990 Mungunda is regarded one of the heroes of the Namibian nation. Mungunda was born in 1932 to migrant labourer Theopoldt Shivute and Emilia Kavezeri, a niece of Hosea Kutako. She had three siblings who all died in their infancy. Sources disagree on what exactly happened to Mungunda, who was employed as a domestic worker, on the day of the Old Location uprising. It is reported that the fatal shooting of her only son, Kaaronda Mungunda, enraged her so much that she ran towards the car of a high- ranking administrator, poured petrol over it, and set it alight. The car either belonged to mayor Jaap Snyman or to Old Location Police Superintendent de Wet. Both cars were set alight during the demonstration. She was shot dead during or immediately after this action. Anna Mungunda is one of nine national heroes of Namibia that were identified at the inauguration of the country's Heroes' Acre near Windhoek.

PLoS ONE 6(4): e19378 as the balance (ratio) between the raw stock correlations that include the index effect and the residual stock correlations (or partial correlations) after subtraction of the index effect.Dror Y. Kenett, Yoash Shapira, Gitit Gur- Gershgoren, and Eshel Ben-Jacob (submitted), Index Cohesive Force analysis of the U.S. stock market, Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Econophysics, Kavala, Greece Defined this way, the ICF provides a means to identify structural changes in the market, which can render it prone to systemic collapses: High values of the ICF characterize a state in which the index predominantly affects the market dynamics while it shades the effect of other degrees of freedom that can contribute to the market flexibility. Thus high values of the ICF correspond to a state in which the market index dominates the behavior of the market, thus making it stiff and hence during such state the market is highly prone to systematic collapses, even due to relatively small external perturbations, leaving it incapable of coping with crises. The transition from normal (healthy) market behavior into abnormal seizure-like behavior at the end of 2001 (the vertical dashed line). Top is the S&P; Index from March 7, 2000 until March 22, 2011. The third panel shows the stock correlations and the second panel shows the partial correlations (the correlations after subtraction of the index effect). The decrease in the partial correlations manifests the abnormal dominance of the Index. This effect is further pronounced when looking at the Index Cohesive Force – the ratio between the stock correlations and the partial correlations, shown at the bottom panel. The network topology before the transition (left) and after the transition (right) Application Recently, the ICF was employed to investigate the time dynamics of the S&P500; during the last decade. The analysis revealed a fast dramatic transition at the end of 2001, from a healthy market characterized by relatively strong residual correlations into an abnormal market behavior signified by very strong correlations together with vanishing residual correlations. This situation, of strong index cohesive force (high ratio between the correlations and residual correlations), is a signature of an over dominance of the index. Such dominance renders the market stiff and prone to systemic collapses. Closer inspection revealed that the anomalously strong index effect is due to the excessive dominance of the financial sector. This dominance and the consequent market stiffness during this period are manifested in the emergence of market \\"seizure\\" behavior – bursts of very high stock correlations that usually coincide with local minima in the index and high volatility. It is proposed that the dangerous excessive dominance of the financial sector might have been a direct consequence of the US hasty and drastic interest rate cuts and other remedies used in 2001 to overcome the fallout effect of the \\"dot com\\" bubble collapse. The abnormal dominance of the financial sector rendered the market prone to a systemic collapse. Hence, eventually, those remedies led to the recent market collapse upon the burst of the subprime bubble and the fall of the Lehman Brothers Bank. \\"Accepting this picture\\", says Ben-Jacob, who also conducts research in human epilepsy, \\"we realize that while the current US policy makers talk about change, in practice they rely on cosmetic changes and avoid the major and painful surgery needed to cure the market.\\" Thus, the ICF is a new quantitative measure to assess the stability and well being of financial markets. It can also be used to compare different markets, and study the coupling between different international markets.

Letzner studied briefly at Wittenberg University in 1550-1551 before moving to Uslar as cantor and school master, and later as vicar to Parensen (1553) Langenholtensen (1564), Lüthorst (1583), Iber (1589) and finally to Strodthagen where he retired in 1610 and died three years later. Letzner's works were widely perused in 18th-century historiography of Germany, but they are now considered highly unreliable. His magnum opus was going to be a \\"Great Chronicle of Brunswick-Lüneburg\\" (\\"Große Braunschweig- Lüneburg-Göttingensche Chronika\\") in eight volumes, on which he worked during 36 years of his life. This work was never printed in full, but the fifteen works Letzner published in print during his lifetime can be seen as portions of this work. Conradus Fontanus is one of the purported sources used by Letzner, allegedly a medieval chronicler with a floruit close to 1200. Fontanus was included by Adelung in his continuation of Jöcher's Gelehrten- Lexicon, but in 20th century scholarship has come to be considered as of dubious historicity, or spurious.Gerhard Bartels, Die Geschichtsschreibung des Klosters Corvey, 1906, 56-57.

The kind of issues addressed, and implications for the approach typically adopted can be gleaned from a list questions posed by Gow (1996). These questions involve anthropologists asking why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail? This anthropology of development has been distinguished from development anthropology.Gow, David D. (1996) Review: The Anthropology of Development: Discourse, Agency, and Culture Reviewed work: An Anthropological Critique of Development: The Growth of Ignorance by Mark Hobart and Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World by Arturo Escobar, Anthropological Quarterly Vol. 69, No. 3, Healing and the Body Politic: Dilemmas of Doctoring in Ethnographic Fieldwork, Jul., pp. 165-173Edelman, Marc, and Angelique Haugerud. (2005). The anthropology of development and globalization: from classical political economy to contemporary neoliberalism. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Pub. Development anthropology refers to the application of anthropological perspectives to the multidisciplinary branch of development studies. It takes international development and international aid as primary objects. In this branch of anthropology, the term development refers to the social action made by different agents (institutions, business, enterprise, states, independent volunteers) who are trying to modify the economic, technical, political or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in impoverished, formerly colonized regions. Development anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer Western projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most marginalized, and to eliminate poverty. While some theorists distinguish between the 'anthropology of development' (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.Edelman, Marc, and Angelique Haugerud. (2005). The anthropology of development and globalization: from classical political economy to contemporary neoliberalism. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Pub, page 40 Early approaches to development Some describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits modernization and an eradication of the indigenous culture, but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work. In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers, however they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based. Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid. The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself. Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that: systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that sustainable development requires at the very least more inclusion of the people who the project aims to target to be involved in the creation, management and decision making process in the project creation in order to improve development. =Pre-WWII: Rhodes-Livingstone Institute= The British government established the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute in 1937 to conduct social science research in British Central Africa. It was part of the colonial establishment, although its head, anthropologist Max Gluckman, was a critic of colonial rule. Gluckman refused to describe colonialism as a simple case of \\"culture contact\\" since it was not a case of cultures mutually influencing each other, but of the forced incorporation of Africans into a foreign social, political and economic system. The anthropologists of the Institute were core members of what came to be known as the \\"Manchester school\\" of anthropology noted for looking at issues of social justice such as apartheid and class conflict. =Culture of poverty= The term \\"subculture of poverty\\" (later shortened to \\"culture of poverty\\") made its first prominent appearance in the ethnography Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty (1959) by anthropologist Oscar Lewis. Lewis struggled to render \\"the poor\\" as legitimate subjects whose lives were transformed by poverty. He argued that although the burdens of poverty were systemic and therefore imposed upon these members of society, they led to the formation of an autonomous subculture as children were socialized into behaviors and attitudes that perpetuated their inability to escape the underclass. In sociology and anthropology, the concept created a backlash, pushing scholars to abandon cultural justifications and negative descriptions of poverty, fearing such analysis may be read as \\"blaming-the-victim.\\" = Modernization Theory and its critics = The most influential modernization theorist in development was Walt Rostow, whose The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non- Communist Manifesto (1960) concentrates on the economic side of the modernization, and especially the factors needed for a country to reach \\"take- off\\" to self-sustaining growth. He argued that today's underdeveloped areas are in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that therefore the task in helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Rostow's unilineal evolutionist model hypothesized all societies would progress through the same stages to a modernity defined by the West. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:W.W. Rostow, The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960), Chapter 2, \\"The Five Stages of Growth-A Summary,\\" pp. 4-16 # Traditional society # Preconditions for take-off # Take-off # Drive to maturity # Age of High mass consumption As should be clear from the subtitle of his book, Rostow sought to provide a capitalist rebuttal to the unilinear Marxist growth models being pursued in the newly independent communist regimes in the second and third world; an effort that would lead to the \\"Green revolution\\" to combat the \\"Red revolution\\". George Dalton and the substantivists George Dalton applied the substantivist economic ideas of Karl Polanyi to economic anthropology, and to development issues. The substantivist approach demonstrated the ways in which economic activities in non-market societies were embedded in other, non-economic social institutions such as kinship, religion and political relations. He therefore critiqued the formalist economic modelling of Rostow. He was the author of \\"Growth without development: An economic survey of Liberia\\" (1966, with Robert W. Clower) and \\"Economic Anthropology and Development: Essays on Tribal and Peasant Economies\\" (1971). Dependency theory Dependency theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to modernization theory. It argues that resources flow from a \\"periphery\\" of poor and underdeveloped states to a \\"core\\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the \\"World-system\\" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system. Immanuel Wallerstein's \\"world-systems theory\\" was the version of Dependency theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency theory. 'Women in development' (WID) Women in development (WID) is an approach to development projects that emerged in the 1970s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. Later, the Gender and development (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation. The WID school grew out of the pioneering work of Esther Boserup. Boserup's most notable book is The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure.(Chicago, Aldine, 1965, ) This book presents a \\"dynamic analysis embracing all types of primitive agriculture.\\" Drawing on Boserup, the WID theorists pointed out that the division of labour in agriculture is frequently gendered, and that in societies practicing shifting cultivation, it is women who conduct most of the agricultural work. Development projects, however, were skewed towards men on the assumption they were \\"heads of households.\\" Development discourse and the creation of the 'underdeveloped' world A major critique of development from anthropologists came from Arturo Escobar's seminal book Encountering Development, which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples. Arturo Escobar views international development as a means for the Occident to keep control over the resources of its former colonies.Arturo Escobar, 1995, Encountering Development Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.34. Escobar shows that between 1945 and 1960, while the former colonies were going through decolonization, development plans helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old metropole. Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of WWII, and during the cold war, when they were developed to 1\\\\. stop the spread of Communism with the spread of capitalist markets; and 2\\\\. create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad. Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like dependency theory or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations. Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of dependency theory and follows a larger critique more recently posed by Foucault and other poststructuralists. =The World Bank and the development regime= =The development of underdevelopment= Governmentality: Development as 'anti- politics machine' Location of Lesotho in South Africa At a critical juncture in the early nineteenth century the state began to connect itself to a series of groups “that in different ways had long tried to shape and administer the lives of individuals in pursuit of various goals” rather than simply extend the absolutist state's repressive machinery of social control.Rose, Nikolas, Pat O'Malley, & Mariana Valverde. (2006). Governmentality. Annual Review of Law and Social Science Vol. 2: 83-104. Michel Foucault’s work on the prison, the clinic, and the asylum – on the development of “bio-power” – analyzed the plurality of governing agencies and authorities who developed programs, strategies, and technologies that were deployed to optimize the health, welfare and life of populations. He referred to this process with the neologism, “governmentality” (governmental rationality). One of the last of these new applied sciences was the \\"development apparatus\\", the post-world war extension of colonial rule after the independence of third world states. James Ferguson utilized the governmentality framework in \\"The Anti-Politics Machine: \\"Development,\\" Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho\\" (1990), the first in many similar explorations. Ferguson sought to explore how \\"development discourse\\" works. That is, how do the language and practices used by development specialists influence the ways in which development is delivered, and what unintended consequences does it foster. He found that development projects which failed in their own terms could be redefined as \\"successes\\" on which new projects were to be modelled. The net effect of development, he found, was to \\"de-politicize\\" questions of resource allocation, and to strengthen bureaucratic power. In his analysis of a development project in Lesotho (South Africa) between 1978 and 1982, he examined the following discursive maneuvers. Ferguson points out that a critical part of the development process is the way in which the object of development is defined. In defining this object, it is severed from its historical and geographic context, and isolated as a \\"Less-Developed Country.\\" In the case of Lesotho, its history as a grain exporting region was ignored, as was its current role as a labour reserve for the South African mines. Not wanting to deal with the apartheid South African regime, development agencies isolated the \\"independent\\" Lesotho from the regional economy in which it was entrapped in their project rationales and reports. Artificially taken out of this larger capitalist context, Lesotho's economy was described as \\"isolated,\\" \\"non-market\\" and \\"traditional\\" and thus a proper target for aid intervention. Ferguson underscores that these discourses are produced within institutional settings where they must provide a charter for governmental intervention. Any analysis which suggests the roots of poverty lie in areas outside the scope of government are quickly dismissed and discarded since they cannot provide a rationale for state action. And since the capitalist economy is one such area which has been ideologically set outside the scope of governmental action, the discursive creation of a deformed ‘native economy’ creates the required opening for that intervention. Ferguson writes that it is not enough to note development's failures; even the project managers initially recognized it as a failure. If that was all Ferguson had done, his book would not have had the influence it did. Asking if development is a failure is asking the wrong question; it ignores the “instrument effects” of what the projects DO do. In other words, we should ask what NON-economic functions does development serve? His answer: # It's an “anti-politics machine”; it makes blatantly political decisions about the allocation of resources appear to be “technical solutions to technical problems”. Important questions such as the reallocation of land to a limited number (leaving them relatively wealthy, and others in poverty) are rephrased as a \\"necessity for the sustainable commercial management of livestock.\\" A large proportion of men are deprived of their retirement savings. # “Integrated development” served to strengthen the presence of a repressive government in an isolated and resistant area. Development projects are dependent upon local governments for implementation, and rarely challenge the nature of that government. The resources they supply frequently serve state needs more than local needs. # It perpetuates the migrant labour system. The project neglected to look at Lesotho in the regional economy with South Africa. Lesotho was a labour reserve for Apartheid-era South African mines. The men of Lesotho were not farmers, but unemployed workers and retirees. Real commercial farming was never a possibility without large subsidies. The project thus served to preserve a pool of cheap labour for South Africa in a time when international sanctions against Apartheid were hitting its economy. = The Limits of Governmentality = =Ecogovernmentality= Ecogovernmentality, (or Eco-governmentality), is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault's genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government. Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how government agencies, in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.Malette, Sebastien. (2009) \\"Foucault for the next century: eco−governmentality\\" in Binkley, S. and Capetillo J. eds. A Foucault for the 21st Century: Governmentality, Biopolitics and Discipline in the New Millennium. Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Work done by Arun Agrawal on local forest governance in India, is an example of this method of analysis. He illustrates how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state. This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes behavior in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and intervention. Agricultural development: the \\"Green Revolution\\" The term \\"Green Revolution\\" was first used in 1968 by former United States Agency for International Development (USAID) director William Gaud, who noted the spread of the new technologies: > \\"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the > makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent Red Revolution like that of > the Soviets, nor is it a White Revolution like that of the Shah of Iran. I > call it the Green Revolution.\\" =Property and inequality= =Rural class formation= =Microcredit institutions= =Integration in global commodity circuits= =Resistance: \\"Weapons of the weak\\"= Food security and famine Newly industrializing nations Critique of Anthropology in development  See also  * Development anthropology * Development criticism * Development studies  References   Further reading  * Escobar, Arturo, 1995, Encountering Development, the making and unmaking of the Third World, Princeton: Princeton University Press. * Gardner, Katy and David Lewis, 1996, Anthropology, Development and the Post-Modern Challenge, Chicago, IL: Pluto Press. * Isbister, John, 1998, Promise Not Kept: The Betrayal of Social Change in the third World.

The station was first opened on 5 July 1915 but was closed between 19 May 1940 and 3 October 1954. It is located on the Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway between Leeuwarden and Groningen. Train services were operated by Arriva. As of 2015, most trains between Groningen and Leeuwarden do not stop at the station, and it is not shown on the standard NS map. There was one departure per day in the direction of Leeuwarden and two departures per day in the direction of Groningen. The station was on an industrial park, and was used almost exclusively by commuters: no buses stopped around the station, and there are hardly any houses in the area that could benefit from the station Although there is only one track, there were two platforms, one in bayonet position, where the train stopped as usual after the level crossing The platforms of Achter de Hoven were relatively far apart, namely a few hundred meters, with the level crossing with Julianastraat and a second level crossing that is located on the FrieslandCampina site. Leeuwarden Station Achter de Hoven was the least used station in the Netherlands until its closure, with only 10 people boarding or departing per day. On August 31, 2018, the last train stopped at this station. Unique Service The station was first opened on July 5, 1915, but closed again on May 19, 1940. the station was reopened on October 3, 1954. In recent years, the station has only been served three times a day, and then only on working days: once in the morning towards Leeuwarden (western platform of the track), and twice in the afternoon towards Groningen (eastern platform of the track). There was an OV- chipkaart check in on both platforms. Only on the eastern platform had a train table, and only for the relevant direction (Groningen). The name of the station was only on the screen of the two OV chipkaart check ins and on the departure side. It stated that the trains depart from track 1a, which is apparently the relevant platform, but no platform numbering was specified. There was no ticket machine at the station. There were shelters on the eastern platform. Tactile paving was also applied to guide the blind. The station was not indicated at all on rail maps. Closure The abandoned platform in 2019 In 2013, the provinces of Friesland and Groningen agreed to increase the number of passenger trains between Groningen and Leeuwarden.

Background Nadim Kassar was born in Beirut in May 1964. His grandfather Wafic Kassar was a judge who became his country's ambassador to Pakistan followed by an ambassadorship to Turkey, and founded the School of Law in Lebanon. Nadim Kassar's uncle, Adnan Kassar, along with his brother, set up the family business as well as serving as a Minister of State and chairing the Lebanese Chamber of Commerce for three decades. Adnan Kassar's was Chairman of Fransabank, which his nephew, Nadim, now runs as general manager. Nadim Kassar's father has also developed his career in banking, becoming CEO and Deputy Chairman of Fransabank and chairing several of its subsidiaries along with being honorary Consul General to the Republic of Hungary. Lebanon has a long established tradition of acting as a vital hub of business activity in the region and elsewhere. Nadim Kassar is one of a new generation of Lebanese businessmen who are striving to put Lebanon back to its central position as a world business centre, in his case through the Lebanese banking industry where he currently works at Fransabank. Established in 1921, Fransabank is today one of Lebanon's main banks, although currently operating under the aegis of the French-based Crédit Agricole bank.Fransabank's Official Website Professional life Nadim Kassar gained first-hand experience in the family run A. A. Kassar trade and investment company, which was first established in 1949. Alongside his work experience during this period, Nadim Kassar attended American University in Beirut and was awarded a BA in Business Administration in 1986. After graduation from the University, he continued working for the family business, eventually rising to the position of general manager. To complement his role in the family company, Kassar also spent his afternoons working at Fransabank, gaining skills and experience in banking and finance. This involvement and interest developed to the point where he decided to move across to Fransabank in 1990, where again he rose to occupy the key position of general manager.Nadim Kassar's Official Website He founded Fransabank El Djazair in Algeria, currently the only Lebanese bank in that country, as well as founding Fransabank's investment arm, Fransa Invest Bank. During his time as general manager, the bank has also grown its network of outlets to 107 branches strategically sited across the country. 2010 saw the bank achieve a record performance with profits up by almost 40%, and this at a time when many banks across the world were struggling to succeed. The bank's ratio of capital reserves were also maintained though this difficult period at a healthy 12%, protecting the bank from sudden worldwide fluctuations in economic and financial activity. In 2008, Nadim Kassar was given an award by the Arab Women's Forum for his contribution to Fransabank, and in 2011, the bank's 90th anniversary year, he also sponsored an award-winning Lebanese film, ‘Stray Bullet’, to encourage the development of modern culture in Lebanon. Other professional achievements include the introduction of Microsoft PC loans to help with the spread of computer access and providing access to PayPass to speed up card transactions.

The order was proposed by David Prangishvili and Mart Krupovic in 2012 and subsequently created by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The name is derived from the Latin , meaning string or thread. Taxonomy There are two families in this order – Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. The virons are filamentous with a helical nucleocapsid. At either end are attached either fibers or more complex structures involved in host adhesion. The major coat proteins of both lipothrixviruses and rudiviruses have an unusual four-helix bundle topology.Goulet A, Blangy S, Redder P, Prangishvili D, Felisberto- Rodrigues C, Forterre P, Campanacci V, Cambillau C (2009) Acidianus filamentous virus 1 coat proteins display a helical fold spanning the filamentous archaeal viruses lineage. PNAS 106 (50) 21155–60 The genome is non-segmented linear double stranded DNA. Viruses from the two families share up to ten genes. The major difference between the two families is that members of the family Rudiviridae are not enveloped, whereas nucleocapsids of lipothrixviruses are surrounded by a lipid membrane. Furthermore, whereas the capsid of rudiviruses is constructed from a single major capsid protein, that of lipothrixviruses is formed from two paralogous major capsid proteins. In both groups of viruses, the major capsid proteins form a claw-like dimer (homodimer in rudiviruses and heterodimer in lipothrixviruses), which wraps around the dsDNA. Members of the Ligamenvirales are structurally related to archaeal viruses of the family Tristromaviridae which, similar to lipothrixviruses, encode two paralogous major capsid proteins with the same fold as in ligamenviruses. Due to these structural similarities, order Ligamenvirales and family Tristromaviridae were proposed to be unified within a class 'Tokiviricetes' (toki means ‘thread’ in Georgian and viricetes is an official suffix for a virus class).

Bunin started working on the book in the late 1940s in France.The Works by I.A.Bunin. Vol.IX. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1965. Commentaries. Pр.579-582. It remained unfinished, and was completed by the writer's widow Vera Muromtseva (aided by Leonid Zurov), and came out posthumously in New York City, in 1955. Translated by Thomas Gaiton Marullo, the book was published in English in 2007, under the title About Chekhov. The Unfinished Symphony.  Background  Ivan Bunin was greatly shocked and aggrieved by the death of Chekhov, his favourite writer. On July 9, 1904, he wrote to Maria Pavlovna, Chekhov's sister: \\"My dear friend, I am thunderstruck. Please bear in mind that with unspeakable pain I share all of you suffering.\\"Literary Heritage. Moscow. Vol. 68 // Литературное наследие, т.68, Москва, 1960, 400-401. In July of the same year Maxim Gorky approached Bunin, suggesting that the latter should take part in a literary Chekhov memorial, a charitable almanac, initiated in Moscow by Aleksander Kuprin and Konstantin Pyatnitsky. \\"I'd suggest that just four of us should take part: Kuprin, you, Andreyev and me. Each might write something personal about Chekhov: about some conversation, the first meeting, remembering a day spent together and, apart from that, contribute a novella. Dear friend, I implore you to take part. We must do just something to counterbalance this barrage of these banal 'reminiscences' in the press. We are to show Chekhov without glamour, pure and clear, sweet and clever man,\\" Gorky wrote Bunin in an 11 July 1904 letter.The Gorky Readings // Горьковские чтения, 1958-1959. P.20 In October 1904 Bunin completed his essay called \\"In Memory of Chekhov\\" and delivered it at the Lovers of Russian Literature Society's special meeting. On 20 November Gorky, having received the essay by post, praised it, mentioning Kuprin's approval. The special Chekhov issue of Znanye almanac (Book III), was published in 1905. In it, under the title \\"In Memory of Chekhov\\" there were the reminiscences of Bunin Stepan Skitalets and Kuprin. It also featured Dachniki, a novelette by Gorky and \\"The Red Laughter\\" by Andreyev. On January 17, 1910, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko invited Bunin to read his memoirs at the Moscow Art Theatre where Chekhov's 50th birthday was commemorated. In 1914 Bunin published \\"From My Notebook\\" sketches in Russkoye Slovo (No.151, July 2, 1914) and the Chekhov-related part of it served as a supplement for the piece published earlier. Along with it came the Odesskye novosty (No.9398, July 2) newspaper interview where Chekhov and his legacy also came up as the main theme. A year later, preparing his first The Complete series, he combined all the pieces and removed all the strong (and now irrelevant) statements concerning social and cultural issues of the early 1900s Russia. Two decades later, compiling his The Complete Bunin edition for the Petropolis publishing house in Berlin, he revised the essay again and renamed it as Chekhov. It was this version which was included into his Memoirs (1950) book. Since 1904, Bunin was cherishing the idea of beginning an extensive Chekhov biography which would have included the latter's vast epistolary legacy. In 1911, answering Maria Chekhova's request that he should contribute a preface to the first volume of Chekhov's letters compilation (which came out later, in 5 volumes), Bunin commented: \\"These letters are wonderful and provide enough material for a large article. But do they need a preface? On serious consideration I'd say, no, they don't. As a basis for future biography, [these letters] are priceless... But to create a full literary portrait, one should look, of course, for many other sources, too.\\"Literary heritage. Vol.68, р.403. Maria Chekhova regarded Bunin as the only person in the world who would be capable of creating the comprehensive Chekhov's biography in prose. On May 10, 1911, she wrote to Pyotr Bykov: \\"You've asked for my opinion as to who might write my late brother's biography and, as you may remember I recommended Ivan Al. Bunin. Now not only do I reaffirm my recommendation but positively ask you to choose him for that purpose. Nobody could write it better, he knew my brother very well, understood him and can perform the task objectively... I repeat: I would very much prefer the biography to be as true as possible to fact, and written by I.A.Bunin\\".Литературное наследие, т.68, стр. 640. Yet this large Chekhov biography has never materialised. In fact, later in Paris, upon rereading his early essay, Bunin inscribed on the copy of the 3rd Znanye book: \\"Written hastily and, occasionally in a wrong way: it was Maria Pavlovna with her narrow-minded prudery that misled me\\". In the late 1940s while in France, Bunin received the Soviet Complete Checkov (published by Goslitizdat) with all letters included. This prompted him to set upon a book of memoirs. \\"In his last year on those sleepless nights - and he's lost almost all of his sleep – he spent his time scribbling things down on scraps of paper and cigarette boxes, remembering details of his conversations with Chekhov,\\" Vera Muromtseva-Bunina remembered. The book remained unfinished and, completed by Muromtseva-Bunina and her assistant Leonid Zurov, was published posthumously in 1955 in New York by Chekhov Publications. Ten years later, in a heavily censored version, it was included into the Volume IX of the Soviet Complete Bunin (1965) with the following explanation in the commentaries: \\"The specifics of this work is such that it's overloaded with quotations from contemporaries' memoirs (Avilova, Tikhonov and others), Chekhov's letters and shorts stories. Since this material is well known to a Soviet reader, it was excluded from this edition. We also omitted several highly tendentious comments on Soviet scholars' works.\\" About Chekhovs full version has become available only in post-Soviet Russia. References External links * О Чехове..

He has played Irish traditional music, bluegrass and country, and is equally at home in a variety of different styles of music. Early life At 12 years of age, and already playing the guitar for five years, he was introduced to Irish Traditional Music by neighbour and fiddler Des Carty, who taught fiddle. During his teenage years he developed as a banjo and mandolin player, making many trips to Fleadhs (Irish Music Festivals), as well as many weekends in County Clare, where his style was honed, playing regularly with the Russell brothers from Doolin, Noel Hill, Tony Linnane and other great Clare musicians. In 1975, he won the Slógadh award as All-Ireland banjo champion. Around this time Paul also started to play fiddle and gig with different folk bands in the Dublin area. Musical career In the early eighties, he discovered Bluegrass and spent four years as fiddler with the Sackville String Band, the popular Dublin outfit that played at concerts and festivals all over the country. The band had been established by Niall Toner in late 1975. Influenced by the recordings of the Fuzzy Mountain, Hollow Rock, and Highwoods String Bands they played \\"American traditional music, old-time songs and bluegrass\\".First poster issued for the band A typical line-up of the band when Kelly joined was Imor Byrne (fiddle), Colin Beggan (guitar), John Caulfield (fiddle), Niall Toner (mandolin) and Richard Hawkins (banjo). The band's reputation was such that many visiting U.S. musicians would jam on stage with them and so Kelly got to hear and play with Bluegrass legends like Peter Rowan, Tex Logan and Kenny Baker. When Niall Toner went off to form Hank Halfhead & the Rambling Turkeys, Kelly joined forces with Irish singer/songwriter Mick Hanly, whose band Rusty Old Halo, he helped to form. Their only release, Still Not Cured, played a large part in establishing a \\"New Country Music Scene\\" in Dublin, with bands like The Wilf Brothers, Hank Halfhead, Chris Meehan and his Redneck Friends and the biggest of them all, The Fleadh Cowboys, all touring the country on a regular basis. Although he had played with all the above bands at some stage, he joined The Fleadh Cowboys in 1989, who were one of the hottest bands in Ireland at that time, touring regularly around the country and also playing monthly in two of London's best known venues: The Mean Fiddler and The Powerhouse. In Dublin, The Fleadh's had the night owls dancing in the aisles at their weekly late- night sell-out residency at The Olympia Theatre. The band established a format where every week a guest or guests would join them on stage. Some of the more notable were The Waterboys, The Hothouse Flowers, Nanci Griffith, John Prine and Joe Ely. The Fleadhs popularity was such at that time that they were invited to play support to U2 in The Point Theatre and to Bob Dylan in the RDS. They also supported The Pogues (who were riding high on the success of Fairytale of New York), on the English and Irish leg of their world tour. In March 1992, after he had established himself as a studio session musician, and had composed the music for the Irish movie, Hard Shoulder, Kelly returned to his traditional roots by joining with Trevor Hutchinson and Gerry O'Beirne in The Sharon Shannon Band. They toured America and Europe that year, in a hectic schedule which culminated with a Late Late Show TV Special which was dedicated to the Clare accordion wizard. In 1997 Kelly founded a record company called Malgamú Music, which tapped into the new eclecticism in Traditional Irish music, and encouraged its artists to experiment with other musical styles, although keeping Irish Music at the core. This project saw six releases including those by the exciting band Lia Luachra, fiddler Kevin O' Connor, guitarist Sean Whelan and his own offering \\"a mandolin album\\", which received excellent reviews and is often quoted as a defining album in Irish music for the mandolin. Current Activity In 2002 he began teaching music in BCFE, a third level college in Dublin. He still teaches there and has also given mandolin workshops in Haapavesi, Finland; Milwaukee University, USA; Carlo Aonzo's International Mandolin Academy in Ferrara, Italy; Tesserete, Switzerland and in the University of Limerick, Ireland. A book of 110 mandolin tunes selected from his repertoire (including some of his own compositions) was published in 2007 and is distributed by Mel Bay. He currently plays and tours with popular Irish singer Eleanor Shanley and singer/guitarist Frankie Lane. In November 2013 (Germany tour) and February–March 2014 (UK tour) he stood in for Gerry O'Connor, the fiddler and banjo player of \\"The Dublin Legends\\", an Irish folk band founded by the remaining members of \\"The Dubliners\\".

A mixture of live and studio- recorded tracks, it was produced by Wilson and John Fischbach. The release includes jazz, blues and pop standards, as well as original music by Wilson and her band. Saxophonist Ravi Coltrane and singer John Legend make guest appearances. The album received mixed, but generally positive, reviews from critics. Reviewers complimented Wilson's vocals and particularly enjoyed the focus on her band. More negative reviews came from critics who felt that Silver Pony was below Wilson's usual standard and contained little originality. The album reached No. 6 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. Composition and recording Silver Pony is a jazz and blues album, with some elements of pop music. The tracks include live improvisations created by Wilson and her band on tour in Warsaw, Seville, and Granada as well as jazz and blues standards. The album opens with a live version of \\"Lover Come Back to Me\\", a 1920s popular song from The New Moon by Oscar Hammerstein II and Sigmund Romberg. This is one of three live tracks that appeared as studio- recorded versions on Wilson's previous album, Loverly (2008); the others are the traditional song \\"Went Down to St James Infirmary\\" and \\"A Day in the Life of a Fool\\" by Luiz Bonfá. \\"Saddle Up My Pony\\" is a version of the 1929 Delta blues song \\"Pony Blues\\" by Charley Patton.

The album features guest appearances by John Legend on \\"Watch the Sunrise\\" and a saxophone solo by Ravi Coltrane on \\"Beneath a Silver Moon\\". The album title and cover art are inspired by an incident from Wilson's childhood in Jackson, Mississippi; \\"A man came around ... with a pony and camera, and you could pay to get your picture taken.\\" Although Wilson's brothers were not interested, her mother allowed her to be photographed on the pony, and the image of Wilson is used on the album cover. Reception Writing for JazzTimes, Carlo Wolff gave the album a positive review. He praised \\"Beneath a Silver Moon\\" and \\"Saddle Up My Pony\\" in particular, and described Wilson's band as \\"exceptional\\". He questioned the inclusion of the two instrumental tracks because of the change in pace they brought but said that overall, the album \\"reaffirms Wilson's status as a premier jazz singer\\". Steve Leggett of Allmusic gave the album a rating of four stars out of five. He described it as \\"a light, shimmering sound\\" and felt that despite the different styles and mix of live and studio material, the album remains cohesive. In a review for The Guardian, John Fordham gave the album four stars out of five. He noted a continuation of \\"confidence and focus\\" from her previous album, Loverly. He described the track list as \\"powerfully compatible\\". Reviewing the album for BBC Music, John Eyles was complimentary and said that it continues a \\"rich vein of form\\" begun with 1993's Blue Light 'til Dawn. He praised Wilson's voice and noted that with Silver Pony, her band are no longer overshadowed. Jim Farber of New York's Daily News noted the equality between Wilson and her band and the balance between her vocals and their instrumentals. He enjoyed the contrast between Wilson's soft vocals and the fast tempo of the songs and noted the seamless transitions between live and studio-recorded tracks. He praised Wilson's growth as an artist in the time since her last live recordings, on 1991's Live. In a review for Paste, Stephen Deusner gave Silver Pony a \\"commendable\\" rating of 7.6 out of 10. He described \\"Went Down to St James Infirmary\\" and \\"Saddle Up My Pony\\" as the best tracks on the album. He praised the band and called them the \\"true stars\\" of the album. Although he commented that Wilson voice has improved over the years, on this album he felt that she was just a \\"support player\\", and enjoyed least the songs that strongly featured her voice. Will Layman of PopMatters gave Silver Pony a more negative review, awarding it six stars out of ten. Although he described Wilson's vocals as \\"deep and delicious\\", and the tracks as \\"fun and funky\\", his opinion was that the album \\"rehashed\\" her Wilson's previous work. He said that although new listeners might be impressed, fans would not find anything new. He praised the band, and enjoyed the renditions of \\"Forty Days and Forty Nights\\" and \\"If It's Magic\\". However, overall he found the album \\"inessential and merely fine\\". The Independents Phil Johnson gave the album a similarly mixed review, suggesting that it \\"might mark time more than break new ground\\". Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Ivan Hewlett gave the album a three star rating. He noted that it was \\"firmly in the territory\\" of Wilson's usual eclectic style, that combines blues, funk and the Great American Songbook. He complimented Wilson's \\"astonishing\\" voice and \\"wonderful\\" band but felt that the album as a whole was \\"all too smooth to be really engaging\\". An unnamed reviewer from the Associated Press gave the album a rating of three and a half stars. They noted the album's mix of live and studio recordings and commented that this was Wilson \\"back to her trademark eclectic ways\\". The reviewer praised the band and particularly enjoyed their improvisation on \\"Lover Come Back to Me\\". Overall, they thought Silver Pony was \\"above-average\\", but inconsistent and below Wilson's usual standard. Writing for Boston.com, Steve Greenlee commented that Wilson's mixed-genre style is no longer innovative, but feels natural. He particularly praised the contributions of Wilson's band members. Chart performance Silver Pony peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart and reached No. 21 on the Top Heatseekers Albums chart.

The fraud reportedly extended over a four- year period, but became more serious \\"in the months before the scandal broke in September\\" 2011. According to Iranian newspapers, Iranian businessman Mahafarid Amir Khosravi (also known as Amir-Mansour Aria and executed in 2014) \\"masterminded\\" the scam, and as of late October 2011 at least 67 people have been interrogated and 31 of them have been arrested.Iran Makes New Arrests in Fraud Case. Rick Gladstone. The New York Times 25 October 2011 Mostafa Pour Mohammadi, the head of a judicial investigations unit, has called the case \\"the most unprecedented financial corruption case in the history\\" of Iran. The scandal has also been called \\"politically sensitive\\", involving Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, a close aide to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, opposed by conservatives. Overview According to Iranian government newspapers and TV channels, the fraud was planned within seven state-owned and private banks, including Saderat Bank of Iran, and is the largest and most important fraud in Iran history. The fraud reportedly was first identified at Bank Melli, Iran's largest commercial bank. According to The New York Times and The Washington Post newspapers, the embezzlement was a \\"scheme to use forged documents or letters of credit to acquire assets, \\"including major state-owned companies\\" or \\"privatized government assets\\", (such as the Khuzestan Steel Company, a major steel producer\\"Iran Accuses Businessman of Bank Fraud\\". Associated Press. The New York Times (12 September 2011)) at \\"one of Iran's top financial institutions\\", Bank Saderat. According to government media, the economics ministry tipped the intelligence authorities about suspicious loan applications in the banking system and the main culprits are as of May 2014 in police custody. Iranian state prosecutor Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i said 19 people have been arrested for being involved in a bank embezzlement scandal. The Washington Post reports 22 suspects \\"including businessmen and bank officials\\" have been arrested, and the chiefs of two banks have been dismissed. On 27 September 2011, Mahomud-Reza Khavari abruptly resigned as the managing director of Bank Melli and flew to Canada after the bank was implicated in the fraud. However, a spokesman for the bank stated that Khavari had gone to Canada for \\"ordinary business reasons\\".\\"Iran: Banker's Return Sought in Bank Scandal\\". The New York Times (29 September 2011) According to the Globe and Mail, a $3 million house in Toronto, is owned in Mahmoud Reza Khavari's name. According to the Iran News Update, in 2005 Khavari became a citizen of Canada allegedly. The investigation determined that Mahafarid Amir Khosravi had masterminded the scheme, with his Aria Investment Development Company being the primary recipient of the loans. Khosravi was convicted of embezzlement, money laundering, and bribery. He and three of his closest associates received the death penalty in July 2012. A total of 39 people were convicted of fraud in the case. On 24 May 2014, Khosravi was executed by hanging. Khavari remains a fugitive. However, Khosravi’s lawyer said that he was made unaware of Khosravi’s execution, according to IB Times. According to BBC, Iran Chief prosecutor said that two other defendants were sentenced to life in prison, whereas 33 more are to spend 25 years jail. Mahmoud Reza Khavari in 2011, took to safety in Canada as reported by Arab news. Furthermore, Khavari has been sentenced on four charges to a cash fine, compensation and a long prison term. Response to scandal =Supreme Leader= On 3 October 2011, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told viewers of Iranian state TV \\"People should know all these (responsible) will be pursued. ... God willing, the traitorous hands will be cut.\\" The leader also stated the media should not use the case to \\"strike at officials.\\"Iran's supreme leader calls for ‘cutting traitorous hands' in huge bank scam. Associated Press,. The Washington Post (3 October 2011) =Parliament= The speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, said that all three branches of the government were determined to deal with the recent banking scam case. Ahmad Tavakkoli, a member of parliament, said on 18 September 2011 that the embezzlement of 28 trillion rials (3,000 billion toman) is an intolerable scandal, adding that if administration officials are not able to handle the affairs, they should step down. In addition, he said that a number of members of parliament have introduced a motion, which envisages the establishment of a special committee to pursue the embezzlement case. With reference to top ranking Iranian government officials, the judiciary mentioned earlier that such a high level of corruption couldn’t have occurred without the support of various people, according to Reuter’s report. According to Aljazeera, a defendant argued that senior officials associated with the scandal had gone scot-free, while individuals with low-level involvement had been intensely prosecuted by the Judiciary. =Mahmoud Ahmadinejad= On 16 September 2011, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad rejected the accusations against some of his administration's officials. Conservative critics of Ahmadinejad have accused his close aide Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei (whom the conservatives strongly oppose) of having connections with Amir-Mansour Aria. According to CNN, the allegation linked to the president concerning the embezzlement of over $2.5 billion is one out of many allegations by Islamists.

It is an iconic site in the department of Saône-et-Loire, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. Protected by the French law on sites naturels classés and currently at the heart of a grand site national operation, it draws its fame severally as a rare geological phenomenon of the region, as a prehistoric site of the eponymous Solutrean paleolithic culture, and for the natural environment which its summit provides, the pelouse calciole grassland of Mâcon, with its distinctive flora and fauna. Occupied by man for at least 55,000 years, it is also the cradle of the Pouilly-Fuissé wine appellation. It has attracted media coverage since the 1980s when French President François Mitterrand started to make ritual ascents of the peak once per year. Physical setting =Geology= During the Mesozoic era, warm seas covered the region, as evidenced by the plentiful fossils to be found there. The Rock of Solutré, like its neighbour the Rock of Vergisson, was created from fossilized coral plateaus that developed approximately 160 million years ago in these seas. In the Cenozoic era, eastern Burgundy underwent the effects of the alpine rising; while the Alps grew higher, the Saône basin sank. At the same time, plateaus rose in the west of the plain, then tumbled towards the east. As these processes brought together landforms of differing natural composition, erosion acted upon them differently. The surrounding landscape eroded to rounded hills, leaving the cliffs of Soulutré and Vergisson as monadnocks on the west side that contrast with gentle slopes on the east. =Countryside= The Rock of Solutré (right) and the Rock of Vergisson (left) Surrounded by vineyards, the rock hosts a varied and spectacular country, from the height of its rocky peak or its grassy slopes. The Saône plain extends to the east, with a view of Mâconnais in the foreground, then Ain and Dombes against the backdrop of the Alps and Mont Blanc in good visibility. In the three other directions the countryside is less open and bounded by the lines and crests of surrounding hills, with vineyards, villages, and typical Mâconnais settlements, in particular: * to the north among the hills and vineyards, the village of Vergisson and its own outcrop ; * to the west, the Roman road, and beyond, a mixed area of vineyards, groves and forests ; * to the south, the village of Solutré-Pouilly and the Mont de Pouilly. Prehistory Solutré's remains from prehistoric times are some of the richest in Europe in bones and stone artifacts. Following their discovery, the Rock gave its name to a culture of the Upper Paleolithic, the Solutrean. =Chronology= Henry Testot-Ferry Excavations at the foot of the rock started in 1866, in a place knowns as the \\"Cros du Charnier\\", on a protrusion of horse bones, which no one imagined at the time would date to prehistory, as archeology was just emerging as a scientific field at the time. The zone of Upper Paleolithic homes was soon discovered by Henry Testot-Ferry, along with some tombs. In the homes, numerous flint tools were found, including spear-points, choppers and other scrapers, and also a large hoard of bones, mainly from reindeer, but also from horses, mammoths, wolves, and cave tigers. Testot-Ferry and Adrien Arcelin decided to see if they could determine scientifically how large the deposit was that they had brought to light, and to examine with great care the remains that they had recovered. The challenge was to understand the arrangement of stratigraphic areas of the site, which would be the basis for establishing a chronology. In 1868, the preferred scientific hypothesis viewed the site as a hunting station. The two discoverers called on specialists and presented their work at conferences. Solutré was revealed as one of the greatest prehistoric sites in France. In 1872, Gabriel de Mortillet, one of the most important prehistorians of his time, decided to name prehistoric periods after sites where they were particularly well presented. Thus the term \\"Solutrean\\" was born. Numerous excavations were conducted thereafter. The excavation site remains protected, and partially unexplored, to this day. =Hunting site= The height of the sites in relation to the flood plain was the most important factor for human habitation. Providing shelter and food for migrant groups, the foot of the rock, strewn with debris, afforded hunters the opportunity to develop traps. The bone-laden magma can be explained by the fact that the site was used by four great paleolithic civilizations over the 25,000 years from 35,000 to 10,000 B.C, an extremely long time period. The use of this site was therefore devoted to hunting activity, butchering and smoking meat, while the neighbouring Rock of Vergisson was a site for habitation. The material found at Solutré was therefore linked with hunting; many tools were found including the flints cut in the shape of bay leaves which are characteristic of Solutrean culture. The Solutré horse hunt, from an illustration of \\"primitive man\\" by L. Figuier, 1876Contrary to the legend of the \\"hunt into the abyss\\", prehistoric man of Solutré region never hunted horses by driving them off the rock. This theory, which was never brought by Testot-Ferry, in his scientific publications, in fact appeared in Arcelin's prehistory-based novel, \\"Solutré\\" (Paris 1872); it has never been other than a fiction which caught the popular imagination. The incongruity of this hypothesis was easily shown from the distance between the bones and the summit of the rock, among other considerations. Another legend told that the dog's domestication was made in Solutré where wolves cooperated with humans during \\"hunt into the abyss\\". This was also falsified in as the first domestic dog has been found in the Altai Mountains and dated 33,000 B.C. =Human remains= Testot-Ferry and Arcelin also brought to light some human remains at Cros du Charnier. In all, by the end of the period of excavations between about 1866 and 1925, almost 70 skeletons had been recovered. Although at the time of the first excavations the corpses were considered as prehistoric (Aurignacians and Neolithics), it has since become almost certain that some of the skeletons are historical. According to different datings, they appear to be Burgundians (from the high Middle Ages) or Merovingians. Paradoxically, despite the length of time when the site was in use, the Solutrean era was the only period in the Upper Paleolithic from which there are no human remains. Ultimately, one year after the first excavations carried out at the rock, remains of Cro-magnon man were discovered at Eyzies by Louis Lartet. The Cro-magnons were contemporaries of the culture who had cut tools and hunted at Solutré. =Museum= The departmental history museum, a structure designed by the architect Guy Clapot from Strasbourg, is situated at the foot of the rock. The museum was encouraged by French President François Mitterrand, and was opened in 1987. Because of regulations in force at the site, the museum lies beneath a dome planted with vegetation, and is hardly visible from a distance. The places where the discoveries were made are presented in the museum along with a reconstructions of scenes from the hunt. The museum also hosts temporary exhibitions on subjects related to archeology, prehistory and ethnography. From antiquity to the modern day The rock's surroundings have been occupied continuously since pre-history, each epoch leaving its mark although sometimes almost invisible to the naked eye. =Antiquity= Traces have been discovered of two important Gallo-Roman villas near the rock. One, Solustriacus, gave its name to the village of Solutré. The other would have been situated between the rock and the neighbouring village of Vergisson. A large flattened mound linking the foot of the rock with Vergisson is suggested to be an ancient Roman road, and is referred to as such by locals. =Post- antiquity= In the Middle Ages, the Rock of Solutré was a powerful high point, reputed to be the domain of bandits. After the truce signed in Mâcon on 4 December 1434 accepting the Burgundian presence in Mâconnais, this castle, the only remaining high place in the region not reduced by the Duke of Burgundy, was handed over to him. The following year the Duke, Philip the good, ordered the total destruction of the fortress by an act passed at Dijon on 22 December 1434. There was such popular jubilation at the pronouncement that bodies have been found of participants in the destruction, killed by the disorderly collapse of the walls. Recent research has shown that the castle had been a noble and wealthy dwelling, but few facts are known about its residents. A high place for the French Resistance during World War II, the rock was ritually climbed each year by President François Mitterrand and certain of his friends. A particular habitat: the pelouses calcicoles of Mâconnais Human activities on and around the rock have had a visible impact on its profile. From the deforestation of the original Gaulish forest to the plantation of the first vineyards, to contemporary polyculture and current monoculture of wine production, the countryside has been shaped and changed. The clearing at the peak and the soft slopes of the rock have contributed to the appearance and maintenance of a local habitat. In fact, until the middle of the 19th century, the wives of farmers herded their goats on these parcels of land surrounded by dry stone walls. This pasturing as well as the practice of burning maintained the dry grass which had developed, hosting numerous rare or protected plant and animal species, who found their most northerly home. The pelouses calcicoles grassland, also known as pelouses calcaires are also found on four other peaks formed in the same epoch (from north to south: Monsard, Mont de Leynes, the Rock of Vergisson, and finally Mont de Pouilly to the south of Solutré). They are protecteded under the French protections and sustainable development rules. When pasturing ceased after the Second World War, the area was colonized by boxtree, juniper and pedunculate oak. Flora include inula, hippocrepis emerus, Bombycilaena erecta, wild orchid, hippocrepis comosa. Mountain and Mediterranean species which share the rock include festuca, carex, bromus, helianthemum, silene, rubia peregrina, Œillet (which can refer to several species), sesleria caerulea, sedum and saxifrage. Notable birds of the rock include the ortolan bunting, the scops-owl, the European nightjar, the short-toed snake eagle, the northern harrier and the woodlark. Notable insects include the scarce swallowtail, the praying mantis and the Mediterranean cricket. Viticulture Introduced by the Romans, viticulture was practiced in the Middle Ages by Cluniac monks and penetrated the perimeter of the rock. Their phases of ebb and flow over the centuries entailed in turn the clearing of plots of land or their abandonment to the countryside. The area's predilection for Chardonnay has given rise to wines with international reputations:For more detail, see Burgundy wine * Mâcon- Solutré (Mâcon-Villages) * Saint-Véran * Pouilly-Fuissé Protection and sustainable development View of the Rock of Solutré from La Grange du Bois hamlet The Rock had been partially protected by the law of 2 May 1930 on the protection of natural monuments and sites of artistic, historic, legendary or picturesque character, by virtue of its spectacular aspect and the archeological sites which it sheltered, and was part of the Natura 2000 network in the context of its pelouses calcioles grassland. These protections have turned out to be insufficient in the face of heavy visitation by locals and tourists, and the usure created on the site, and maintenance costs which are too heavy for the local communes. From the 1990s the Rock has been officially made the focus of an Operation Grand Site. This law does not add any regulatory constraints but constitutes a tool for restoring and bringing value to the site, setting up a reception, and generating a dynamic local economy and a continuing management of the area. Since 1995 trials have taken place to maintain the site as is involving e.g. grazing by Konik Polski horses and fighting colonization by boxtree through pasturing. The pathways have been revised to enhance safety for visitors and to stop the degradation of tracks, the parking lot has made way for a new one, which integrates almost completely with the landscape. For more information see The official website of Grand Site de Solutré Pouilly Vergisson Anecdotes The 2009 Michelin guide for Bourgogne, in its article on the Rock of Solutré, mistakenly displayed a photograph of the Rock of Vergisson. =Well-known quotations concerning the rock= * Sphinx aux griffes plantées dans les ceps (A Sphinx with claws planted in the vines) * Deux navires pétrifiés surplombant une mer de vignes (Two petrified ships overlooking a sea of vineyards) Alphonse de Lamartine, speaking of the two rocks of Solutré Vergisson * De là, j'observe ce qui va, ce qui vient, ce qui bouge et surtout ce qui ne bouge pas. (From there, I watch that which goes, that which comes, that which moves, and overall that which does not move) François Mitterrand in La Paille et le Grain, 1978.

The signs seen on clinical exam and postmortem are normally sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis. This diagnosis can be confirmed using laboratory tests such as bacterial culture, PCR and ELISA. Treatment and control Antibiotics are the treatment of choice. The type of antibiotic selected should be determined by licensing and sensitivity testing. Both a live and inactivated vaccines are available to control the disease. Good husbandry is also an essential part of disease prevention.

It is found in western Canada, including British Columbia and the Alberta. The wingspan is 12–15 mm. The red-striped needleworm moth occurs commonly in the spruce-fir forests of North America, but there are no records of serious outbreaks. White spruce is the preferred host tree. The eggs overwinter on the needles and the larvae feed on the new foliage from late May to late July. Full-grown larvae, about 9 mm long, drop to the ground and pupate in silken cocoons in the litter. The adults emerge in late summer and the fall, and the females lay their eggs singly at the base of the needles. The larvae have been recorded on Abies balsamea, Abies concolor, Abies grandis, Abies lasiocarpa, Abies magnifica, Juniperus, Larix laricina, Larix lyallii, Larix occidentalis, Picea engelmanni, Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Picea pungens, Picea rubens, Picea sitchensis, Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Thuja plicata and Tsuga heterophylla.

Content Lin Yuxiang attends the third year of middle school in a city near Shanghai, and a literary circle linked to the school. The preparation of the teacher Ma Debao, an old acquaintance of Yuxiang's father, is decidedly inadequate, and his didactically inconclusive lessons cause the abandonment of several members. To try to revive the attention, Ma Debao organizes a trip to the ancient city of Zhouzhuang; students are divided into groups, Lin Yuxiang joins his friend Luo Tiancheng and class representative Shen Xi'er. While visiting the tourist area of the city, crossed by canals and bridges, Shen Xi'er recognizes her friend, the beautiful Susan who has a foreign name because she lived in Canada. The girl immediately unleashes the competitiveness between the two males, although until now both have declared themselves disinterested in females. In the following days Luo Tiancheng wrote a love letter to Susan, who attends their own school, but is refused. Lin Yuxiang, also in love with the beautiful girl, lives his passion with greater discretion. But Debao insists that the pupils participate in a literary competition organized by a Beijing institution, Lin Yuxiang pampers ancient authors to put together a decent composition. Meanwhile the end-of-year exams are approaching, his parents demand a high grade that allows him to access a prestigious school. They send it repeatedly, but lessons are held by old or poor teachers. Here he meets the same age Liang Zijun, more interested in being successful with the girls who are studying. Surprisingly, his composition wins the first national award and is published in a literary magazine. The correspondence comes from many readers from all over China. During a school trip to Nanjing, he manages to sit on the bus next to Susan. With her, however, she has no hopes: she is emboldened by literary notoriety, writes to her in old Chinese letters of love, to which she replies with diplomacy, wishing him success in her studies to access one of the prestigious universities in Shanghai. Before the final exam, Yuxiang receives a tip from Liang Zijun on the title of the theme but does not give him credit, so during the rehearsal shines in all subjects except Chinese language. The result allows him access to one of the best high schools in the district, but a friend of his mother manages to get him admitted to the prestigious High School n. 3 South of Shanghai for \\"sporting merits\\", subject to payment of a bribe from Lin. Yuxiang would prefer to stay at the district school to stay near Susan, but the parents are adamant. The protagonist arrives in the new school where the instructors immediately realize that his sporting merits are non-existent. When the school year begins, Yuxiang is excited by the prospect of living in a dormitory, away from the family, but his enthusiasm soon disappears. Students admitted for sporting merit are considered with haughtiness from those who have obtained a high score on the exam. A classmate, Quiang Rong, admitted to payment, boasts the knowledge of his father among the famous writers, then Yuxiang reveals to girls that they have published a text in a national magazine. Joined the literary club, Yuxiang discovers that there is a great rivalry among members interested in non- fiction, those interested in prose and poets. He offers to layout the literary magazine of the school, even if he has no experience, and in this way he puts on show, so that when the outgoing director resigns he also advises members to replace him with Lin Yuxiang, who is above of the parties. Fingering reluctance, Yuxiang agrees, and can boast with Qian Rong of becoming president. This however does not make much impact on his rival. Both are hit virtually simultaneously by a misfortune of love: Quiang Rong leaves with her girlfriend Yao Shuqin, who attends their own school, and Yuxiang receives a letter from Luo Tiancheng, who tells him that Susan comes out with a partner of school, a genius of the sciences. Desperate, after getting confirmation by letter from Shen Xi'er, Yuxiang spends a night out of the dorm, falling asleep after wandering aimlessly. His performance at school is affected, he has five negative subjects, and he continues to not study imagining he can recover. Actually Susan sent him false news for him to put his heart in peace and study, from the moment he wants to attend a prestigious university with him; but when he finds out that he is wasting his chance he tells him that he never wants to hear his voice again. In addition, the school management discovers that Yuxiang has spent a night out without authorization: his father is warned and a disciplinary sanction is triggered. Desperate, Yuxiang not only understands that he has lost his Susan and the trust of his parents, but also that he has wasted the chance that had been given to him.

With her basic art education in painting and typography at the Zurich School of Art and Design Perschel continued her learning at the international summer academy in Salzburg. Influenced by masters Joseph Mikl and Emilo Vedova, she soon started to develop her own distinctive style of paintings focusing in her works on the effects and interactions of lights and colors. Perschel's interest in chromatics and the effects of lights redirected her artistic talents with noticeable impact on her works. Since 1989 she conducts chromatic seminars and courses in painting in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Starting in 1993, she further deepened her expertise and education in the interdisciplinary composition of colors in the area of architecture at the International Association of Color Consultants (IACC) represented by the alliance of European color consultants (BEF) in Salzburg. In 1996 Perschel graduated with a revolutionizing diploma work: Perception of colors and effects of compositions of colors in the medical field.

A combination of physical forms and a distinctive creative style that has influenced her paintings ever since. Today, Perschel's work is far away from the artistic mainstream as her paintings succeed to fill a room with a mood and expression of art and science and facilitate an interconnection of matter and human beings.

It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also dedicated to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and had become too small for its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed £936 towards the total cost of £1,417, rather than near the area where many of the parishioners lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married into the family that owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained glass that had once belonged to a Flemish monastery. The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, one of four in the parish of Amlwch. It is a Grade II* listed building, a national designation given to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\", in particular because of its \\"fine collection\\" of stained glass. History and location St Gwenllwyfo's Church stands in a churchyard on a sloping site on the west side of a rural road, about from the beach at Dulas, in the north-east of Anglesey, Wales. It was built in the mid-19th century at a cost of £1,417 to replace its medieval predecessor, which was then abandoned. The old church, also dedicated to St Gwenllwyfo (a 7th-century woman about whom nothing else is known) was in need of repair and its congregation was too large for the building. Although many in the congregation lived in Nebo (in the north of the parish), it was decided to build the new church about two-thirds of a mile from its predecessor (about 1.1 km) to the south-west in the vicinity of the Llys Dulas estate, whose owners had long been connected with the church. The largest donation towards the new parish church (£936) came from Gertrude, the widow of William Hughes, 1st Baron Dinorben (died 1852), owner of Llys Dulas. Gertrude, whose husband had become rich from copper mining on Anglesey at Parys Mountain, also rebuilt the main house of Llys Dulas in the mid-1850s; it was demolished in 1976 after becoming derelict. Her daughter and heiress Gwyn Gertrude Hughes laid the foundation stone on 14 September 1854, using a silver trowel and ebony mallet. A box placed underneath the stone contained a Bible, a prayer book, a document with details of the event and an example of every British coin minted in that year. Those present were addressed in Welsh by the clergyman James Williams and in English by the curate of the parish, Morris Williams (more commonly known by his bardic name \\"Nicander\\"). The church (designed by Henry Kennedy, the architect for the Diocese of Bangor) opened in 1856. Gwyn Gertrude Hughes married Sir Arundell Neave in 1871. He donated some 15th and 16th-century Flemish stained glass inherited from his father to the church in 1876. After Gwyn's death in 1916 she was buried in a vault under the chancel of the church, as her mother had been in 1871. Previous members of the family had been buried in the ancestral vault at St George's Church, Kinmel, but a family dispute from 1849 led to a new vault being required. St Gwenllwyfo's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales. It is one of four churches in the parish of Amlwch, along with St Eleth's, Amlwch, St Eilian's, Llaneilian, and St Tyfrodog, Llandyfrydog. The parish is within the deanery of Twrcelyn, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2012, the priest in charge is H. V. Jones. Architecture and fittings =Structure= The church, designed in the Gothic revival style, is built from rubble masonry dressed with gritstone, and has a slate roof. There is a three-stage tower with buttresses at the base at the west end of the building, topped with a spire. The tower has one window in the west wall in the lowest stage, narrow windows on three sides in the middle stage, and pairs of windows topped with hoodmoulds around the tower in the section below the spire. The 18th-century bell comes from the old church. St Gwenllwyfo's is entered through a porch on the south side near the west end; an internal doorway at the west end of the nave leads into the vestry in the tower. The nave has four bays (internal sections) and the chancel, to the east of the nave, has two. The chancel is separated from the nave by a decorated arch and a step, which raises it above the level of the nave. Within the chancel, the sanctuary is raised by a further three steps and marked by a rail. The window on the north side of the church has a trefoil pattern at the top, and the hoodmould is decorated with faces. The south side of the building has a number of arched windows, singularly or in pairs, also with hoodmoulds. The arched east window has three lights (sections of window, separated by mullions) with trefoil patterns of tracery at the top. The east wall has a blocked doorway on the south side. =Stained glass= The stained glass panels donated by Neave came from a monastery in Leuven, in the Flanders region of Belgium; much of the glass uses distinctive Flemish emblems. They had been purchased by his father Thomas from a Norwich-based German merchant, Hampp, who had trade links with Flanders. The 27 panels mainly date from around 1522, although the oldest glass is from the late 14th or early 15th century and there is some later glass from about 1600. Further pieces of glass were given by Neave to a church in Noak Hill, Essex (near Dagnam Park, from which came the title of Neave's baronetcy) and the houses of Dagnam Park and Llys Dulas. Other examples of the monastery's stained glass are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the Burrell Collection in Glasgow. The east window has scenes from Christ's betrayal and crucifixion, the Adoration of the Magi and Christ's return from Egypt with his family. The top of the window uses glass fragments from a chapel commemorating Pope Adrian VI; he was tutor to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, whose head appears in the window, along with pictures of musical angels. Other windows in the nave and chancel contain saints or depictions of incidents in Christ's life (including one of Jesus wearing a straw hat after his resurrection, said to be \\"very rare\\"). =Memorials and other fittings= A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a brass memorial plaque from 1609, erected by Richard Williams to his wife Marcelie Lloyd, daughter and co-heiress of David Lloyd of Llysdulas. The plaque, which was previously in the old church, bears three shields, one with the coat of arms of Williams, another with Marcelie Lloyd's arms, and the middle one with the two coats of arms combined. Below the shields, husband and wife are shown with their children (Anne, William and Griffith) kneeling in prayer on cushions. The survey also noted a plain silver cup, dated 1711–1712. Other items of communion plate (an inscribed silver chalice, a plain silver paten and a plain silver flagon) were donated by Gwyn Gertrude Hughes in 1866. The church furniture (including the octagonal wooden pulpit and the choir stalls) dates from the 19th century, although the octagonal font was reused from the old church. The church has a number of other memorials from the 19th and 20th centuries, commemorating members of the various families associated with Llys Dulas (Neave, Hughes and Dinorben). The nave has three funerary hatchments (black diamond-shaped boards displaying the deceased's coat of arms) for Lord Dinorben, his wife Gertrude, and Sir Arundel Neave. A large slate tablet on the west wall of the nave records how much Gertrude and others contributed to the cost of the church. A model of the church made from matchsticks is kept within a glass case in the chancel. Assessment St Gwenllwyfo's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II* listed building – the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". It was given this status on 12 May 1970 and has been listed as \\"a mid 19th-century Gothic revival church closely associated with the Llys Dulas estate\\". Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes the church's \\"fine collection of 15th- and 16th-century Flemish stained glass panels\\", which it says is the \\"second largest such collection in the world\\", and the 17th-century brass plaque. A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes the church as \\"impressively large\\", and comments that the \\"steeply-pitched slate roof\\" gives the interior \\"a sense of space\\". It also notes the \\"considerable amounts\\" of stained glass, which it describes as \\"impressive\\". It commented that it \\"contains a wealth of interesting items which are worth seeing.\\" A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region describes the building as \\"a Victorian estate church with its needle spire rising over trees\\", which it says is \\"disproportionately tall\\", and adds that it was \\"one of Kennedy's better works\\". It says that the glass is \\"outstanding\\". Notes The cost of construction of the church can be inflated to contemporary values using changes in the British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost of construction or investment as a proportion of the economy's total output of goods and services. This allows consideration of the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of 2012, the figures are updated using data from 2010, the latest year for which data is available.

Born in Kent Town, South Australia, Middleton made his first-class debut on 28 February 1913 for South Australia against Victoria at the Adelaide Oval. Batting at number seven, Middleton scored 20 and 14 as South Australia won by 166 runs. Middleton's highest score of 34 was made as an opener in the match against Victoria at Adelaide Oval starting 13 February 1914 and his final match, also against Victoria, was the final first-class match in Australia before first-class cricket was suspended due to World War I. Although his first-class statistics were average, Middleton was a leading player in Adelaide district cricket, once scoring an unbeaten 201 for East Torrens Cricket Club against Glenelg Cricket Club during the 1912/13 season,Harte, p. 434. and his 770 runs for the 1914 season was the record aggregate for any batsman in the South Australian district competition since it was established in 1897. Following the war, Middleton worked in investments management, becoming manager of the Executive Trustee and Agency Co. in Adelaide, and became involved in cricket administration, initially with his club side East Torrens, where he became secretary.Harte, p. 266. In 1926 he was elected South Australian Cricket Association treasurer, a position he held until 1949,Harte, p. 279. appointed to the Grounds and Finance CommitteeHarte, p. 250. and became a member of the Australian Cricket Board of Control.Townsville Daily Bulletin, \\"Middleton new Cricket Board Chairman\\", 18 September 1952, p. 7. In 1929 Middleton further consolidated his role as a senior figure in South Australian cricket when he was made chairman of SACAs Cricket Committee.Harte, p. 259. In these roles, Middleton was forced to deal with problems related to the onset of the Great Depression, including a significant drop in SACA income and requests for aid by former players in financial difficulties (such as Ernie Jones).Harte, p. 269. Additionally, he was involved in the recruitment to South Australia of leading players, such as Don Bradman and Jack Badcock.Harte, p. 270. Following the death of SACA President Harry Blinman on 23 July 1950,Harte, p. 306. Middleton, who was Vice-President, was elected to the position of President, a position he would hold until September 1965.Harte, p. 338. Middleton was appointed chairman of the Australian Cricket Board of Control on 18 September 1952, the first in 25 years to have played first-class cricket.The Argus (Australia), \\"New chief for Control Board\\", 18 September 1952, p. 10. He served as chairman for one three- year term, retaining his SACA positions. Outside of cricket, Middleton was a leading figure in Adelaide society, serving as President of the influential Commonwealth Club. In 1962, Middleton was awarded honorary life membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in appreciation \\"of the high service rendered to the game.\\"Harte, p. 333. Throughout the 1960s, there had been a growing push for cricket to be played on Sundays, a move staunchly opposed by the conservative Middleton. By September 1965, with the majority of SACA members in favour of play on Sunday, Middleton decided to retire from the presidency, although he continued to remain active in the association.

You can get information and order the card at helsenorge.no, or by calling 23 32 70 00 (Veiledning helsenorge.no). Please be advised that not all members of the Norwegian National Insurance scheme are entitled to the European Health Insurance card. To be entitled to a European health insurance card, the primary condition is that one is a member of the Norwegian National Insurance scheme, and that the person is a Norwegian citizen or a citizen of another EU/EEA country or Switzerland. The European health insurance card is a plastic card the size of a regular bank card. The scheme also covers family members, i.e. spouses and children under the age of 25. They are entitled to European health insurance cards regardless of citizenship and of whether they are members of the National Insurance scheme. Each family member must carry their own European health insurance card. The insurance card is issued for three years, provided that conditions are still met.  Patient charges and exemption card  You are entitled to a healthcare exemption card (Frikort) once you have paid a certain amount in user fees when receiving healthcare services. When you present your exemption card, you do not have to pay user fees for the remainder of the calendar year. There are two exemption card schemes for health care services. You can get an overview of your registered user fees in the self-service solution \\"Mine egenandeler\\" at helsenorge.no. (Login required.) Members of the Norwegian National Insurance scheme, only pay a fixed part of the cost of public health services, called patient charges. This applies to medical treatment, buying medicines on a refundable prescription, physiotherapy, seeing a psychologist and travel expenses to consultations and treatment appointments. If a person has paid a certain amount in patient charges, he or she is eligible for an exemption card. This means he or she is exempt from paying patient charges for the rest of the calendar year. There are two types of exemption cards. The amounts are set annually by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting. The exemption card for user fee group 1 covers approved patient charges paid to doctors, psychologists and outpatient clinics and for x-rays, patient travel and blue prescription medicine and equipment. The exemption card for user fee 2 covers approved patient charges paid for physiotherapy, certain dental diseases, approved rehabilitation institutions and travel for treatment abroad organised by Oslo University Hospital – Rikshospitalet HF.

Following the late-2000s financial crisis, the British residential property market became increasingly uncertain.Jill Treanor, \\"Demand for mortgages slumped in the last quarter of 2010, reports Bank\\", The Guardian, Thursday 6 January 2011 In contrast to Scotland and the United States, the England and Wales property market's volatility stems from the fact that a seller's acceptance of the buyer's offer is not legally binding until contracts are exchanged. This is a result of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 s.2, requiring that a contract for the sale of land must be in writing. This precept of English law dates back to the Statute of Frauds of 1677, and is intended to prevent dishonesty. It can take as long as 3 months from acceptance of the offer for the conveyancing to be completed, during which time the property market could increase in value sufficiently that the seller believes they could get a better price by pulling out and listing their property again, gazanging the buyer.  Gazumping and gazundering  Gazumping and gazundering are related phenomena, describing specific cases where either the seller raises the price, or the buyer lowers their offer. In contrast, gazanging is not intended to improve either party's position to achieve a better deal. Instead, the seller pulls out of the sale entirely, leaving the buyer with no recourse whatsoever.

History Colantonio operated in Naples from around 1440 to 1460, under king René of Anjou (1438–1442), an admirer of Flemish, Burgundian and Provençal art, and under Alfonso V of Aragon, who was connected to Aragon, where art was in turn inspired by Flemish models. The diversity of these two influences is visible in the two panels executed by Colantonio for the Franciscan church of San Lorenzo Maggiore, which were painted in two different moments and were later completed by Antonello da Messina with smaller side panels of blessed Franciscans. The general theme of the altarpiece was the celebration of the Franciscan thought, of which St. Jerome, according to the theories of St. Bernardino of Siena, had been one of the main influences. Description The scene depicts, above a gilt background, a slender St. Francis of Assisi who, in the center, consigns the Franciscan Rule to his brothers, who are kneeling around him. The men at the left, with Fra Leone receiving the book, and the women at the right, including St. Claire. At the top are two symmetrical flying birds, which hold two cartouches. The work shows that Colantonio, at the time of its realization, was already acquainted of the novelties brought from Aragon at Alfonso's court. This is visible in details such as the steep, nearly vertical pavement, the characters' feature, the holed aureolas, the rigid and geometrical folds of the clothes. The other panel, depicting St. Jerome in His Study, despite being one or two years earlier, is still more influenced by the early Netherlandish painting in favour at the Angevine court, with painters such as Barthélemy d'Eyck.

Despite receiving top billing, Bela Lugosi has a relatively small part. The film is also known as He Lived to Kill and Terror in the Night. Plot Police have been vainly searching the countryside for the knife- wielding Maniac, who has been on a murderous spree. The Maniac's victims are each found with a taunting newspaper clipping attached to their body. After the wealthy uncle of a young scientist is mysteriously murdered, people wonder if the Maniac is responsible. Prior to his uncle's death, the young scientist in question, Dr. Arthur Hornsby, claimed to have developed a method of living without oxygen for extended periods. To prove his theory, he had himself buried after taking a dose of the serum. Despite his incapacity, the death of his uncle leaves a vast fortune, which is to be divided amongst his family members and servants. In the event that one or more them dies, the inheritance is split among the remaining survivors. Subsequently, members of the family begin to die, one-by-one, and suspicion is cast on the servants, including the \\"mystic\\" butler (Bela Lugosi). At the end, we discover that Dr. Hornsby faked his burial and was using it as a cover for committing the murders. His plan was to kill any other heirs to his uncle's fortune so that he might obtain sole possession. His plan is eventually discovered and exposed by the butler. The Maniac is shot, and apparently killed, by the newspaper reporter, Tom Hartley; but in the closing moments of the film, he comes back to life and claims that he will haunt the audience if they reveal the plot twist to anyone.

While traveling approximately in a straight line, a beam of light can also be rotating (or \\"spinning, or \\"twisting) around its own axis. This rotation, while not visible to the naked eye, can be revealed by the interaction of the light beam with matter. There are two distinct forms of rotation of a light beam, one involving its polarization and the other its wavefront shape. These two forms of rotation are therefore associated with two distinct forms of angular momentum, respectively named light spin angular momentum (SAM) and light orbital angular momentum (OAM). The total angular momentum of light (or, more generally, of the electromagnetic field and the other force fields) and matter is conserved in time.  Introduction  Light, or more generally an electromagnetic wave, carries not only energy but also momentum, which is a characteristic property of all objects in translational motion. The existence of this momentum becomes apparent in the \\"radiation pressure phenomenon, in which a light beam transfers its momentum to an absorbing or scattering object, generating a mechanical pressure on it in the process. Light may also carry angular momentum, which is a property of all objects in rotational motion. For example, a light beam can be rotating around its own axis while it propagates forward. Again, the existence of this angular momentum can be made evident by transferring it to small absorbing or scattering particles, which are thus subject to an optical torque. For a light beam, one can usually distinguish two \\"forms of rotation, the first associated with the dynamical rotation of the electric and magnetic fields around the propagation direction, and the second with the dynamical rotation of light rays around the main beam axis. These two rotations are associated with two forms of angular momentum, namely SAM and OAM. However this distinction becomes blurred for strongly focused or diverging beams, and in the general case only the total angular momentum of a light field can be defined. An important limiting case in which the distinction is instead clear and unambiguous is that of a \\"paraxial light beam, that is a well collimated beam in which all light rays (or, more precisely, all Fourier components of the optical field) only form small angles with the beam axis. For such a beam, SAM is strictly related with the optical polarization, and in particular with the so-called circular polarization. OAM is related with the spatial field distribution, and in particular with the wavefront helical shape. In addition to these two terms, if the origin of coordinates is located outside the beam axis, there is a third angular momentum contribution obtained as the cross-product of the beam position and its total momentum. This third term is also called \\"orbital, because it depends on the spatial distribution of the field. However, since its value is dependent from the choice of the origin, it is termed \\"external orbital angular momentum, as opposed to the \\"internal OAM appearing for helical beams.  Mathematical expressions for the angular momentum of light  One commonly used expression for the total angular momentum of an electromagnetic field is the following one, in which there is no explicit distinction between the two forms of rotation: :\\\\mathbf{J} = \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\int \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\times\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right) d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} , where \\\\mathbf{E} and \\\\mathbf{B} are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, \\\\epsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity and we are using SI units. However, another expression of the angular momentum naturally arising from Noether’s theorem is the following one, in which there are two separate terms that may be associated with SAM (\\\\mathbf{S}) and OAM (\\\\mathbf{L}): :\\\\mathbf{J}=\\\\epsilon_0\\\\int \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} +\\\\epsilon_0\\\\sum_{i=x,y,z}\\\\int \\\\left({E^i}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\right)A^i\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r}=\\\\mathbf{S} +\\\\mathbf{L} , where \\\\mathbf{A} is the vector potential of the magnetic field, and the i-superscripted symbols denote the cartesian components of the corresponding vectors. These two expressions can be proved to be equivalent to each other for any electromagnetic field that vanishes fast enough outside a finite region of space. The two terms in the second expression however are physically ambiguous, as they are not gauge-invariant. A gauge-invariant version can be obtained by replacing the vector potential A and the electric field E with their “transverse” or radiative component \\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\perp} and \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\perp}, thus obtaining the following expression: :\\\\mathbf{J}_{\\\\perp}=\\\\epsilon_0\\\\int \\\\left({\\\\mathbf{E}}_{\\\\perp}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\perp}\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} +\\\\epsilon_0\\\\sum_{i=x,y}\\\\int \\\\left({E^i}_{\\\\perp}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\right)A^i_{\\\\perp}\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} . A justification for taking this step is yet to be provided. The latter expression has further problems, as it can be shown that the two terms are not true angular momenta as they do not obey the correct quantum commutation rules. Their sum, that is the total angular momentum, instead does. An equivalent but simpler expression for a monochromatic wave of frequency ω, using the complex notation for the fields, is the following: :\\\\mathbf{J}= \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_0}{2i\\\\omega}\\\\int \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}^\\\\ast\\\\times\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} +\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_0}{2i\\\\omega}\\\\sum_{i=x,y,z}\\\\int \\\\left({E^i}^{\\\\ast}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\right)E^{i}\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} . Let us now consider the paraxial limit, with the beam axis assumed to coincide with the z axis of the coordinate system. In this limit the only significant component of the angular momentum is the z one, that is the angular momentum measuring the light beam rotation around its own axis, while the other two components are negligible. :\\\\mathbf{J}\\\\approx\\\\frac{\\\\hat{z}\\\\epsilon_0}{2\\\\omega}\\\\int \\\\left({E}_\\\\text{L}^2-{E}_\\\\text{R}^2\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} +\\\\frac{\\\\hat{z}\\\\epsilon_0}{2i\\\\omega}\\\\int \\\\sum_{i=x,y,z}\\\\left({E^i}^\\\\ast \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\phi}E^{i}\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} . where E_\\\\text{L} and E_\\\\text{R} denote the left and right circular polarization components, respectively.  Exchange of spin and orbital angular momentum with matter  Spin and orbital angular momentum interaction with matter When a light beam carrying nonzero angular momentum impinges on an absorbing particle, its angular momentum can be transferred on the particle, thus setting it in rotational motion. This occurs both with SAM and OAM. However, if the particle is not at the beam center the two angular momenta will give rise to different kinds of rotation of the particle. SAM will give rise to a rotation of the particle around its own center, i.e., to a particle spinning. OAM, instead, will generate a revolution of the particle around the beam axis. These phenomena are schematically illustrated in the figure. In the case of transparent media, in the paraxial limit, the optical SAM is mainly exchanged with anisotropic systems, for example birefringent crystals. Indeed, thin slabs of birefringent crystals are commonly used to manipulate the light polarization. Whenever the polarization ellipticity is changed, in the process, there is an exchange of SAM between light and the crystal. If the crystal is free to rotate, it will do so. Otherwise, the SAM is finally transferred to the holder and to the Earth. = Spiral Phase Plate (SPP) = Schematic of generating light orbital angular momentum with spiral phase plate. In the paraxial limit, the OAM of a light beam can be exchanged with material media that have a transverse spatial inhomogeneity. For example, a light beam can acquire OAM by crossing a spiral phase plate, with an inhomogeneous thickness (see figure). = Pitch-Fork Hologram = Schematic showing generation of orbital angular momentum of light in a Gaussian beam. A more convenient approach for generating OAM is based on using diffraction on a fork-like or pitchfork hologram (see figure). Holograms can be also generated dynamically under the control of a computer by using a spatial light modulator. = Q-Plate = The q-plate effect for left and right-hand circular polarizations. Another method for generating OAM is based on the SAM-OAM coupling that may occur in a medium which is both anisotropic and inhomogeneous. In particular, the so-called q-plate is a device, currently realized using liquid crystals, polymers or sub-wavelength gratings, which can generate OAM by exploiting a SAM sign-change. In this case, the OAM sign is controlled by the input polarization. = Cylindrical Mode Converters = pi/2-cylindrical mode converter transforms HG mode into a proper LG mode. OAM can also be generated by converting a Hermite-Gaussian beam into a Laguerre- Gaussian one by using an astigmatic system with two well-aligned cylindrical lenses placed at a specific distance (see figure) in order to introduce a well-defined relative phase between horizontal and vertical Hermite-Gaussian beams.  Possible applications of the orbital angular momentum of light  The applications of the spin angular momentum of light are undistinguishable from the innumerable applications of the light polarization and will not be discussed here. The possible applications of the orbital angular momentum of light are instead currently the subject of research. In particular, the following applications have been already demonstrated in research laboratories, although they have not yet reached the stage of commercialization: # Orientational manipulation of particles or particle aggregates in optical tweezers # High-bandwidth information encoding in free- space optical communication # Higher-dimensional quantum information encoding, for possible future quantum cryptography or quantum computation applications # Sensitive optical detection  See also  * Angular momentum * Circular polarization * Electromagnetic wave * Helmholtz equation * Light * Light orbital angular momentum * Light spin angular momentum * Optical vortices * Orbital angular momentum multiplexing * Polarization (waves) * Photon polarization  References   External links  * Phorbitech * Glasgow Optics Group * Leiden Institute of Physics * ICFO * Università Di Napoli \\"Federico II\\" * Università Di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\" * University of Ottawa  Further reading   Category:Light ","title":"Angular momentum of light"},{"id":"33149848","text":"Ugo is an Italian television series.

Lat-Dior sought refuge with the Maad a Sinig, who granted him asylum. The Damel-Teigne asked the Maad a Sinig to loan him some of his forces so he could fight against the French and regain his throne. The Maad a Sinig refused to do that because he was already engaged in a long battle against the French himself in regards to the sovereignty of Joal, one of his provinces. Lat-Dior sought the assistance of Maba, the Almami of Nioro du Rip. Maba promised to help Lat-Dior regain his throne if he converted to Islam. Lat-Dior converted and in 1867, he proposed to the Almami to launch a jihad in Sine.Diouf, Niokhobaye. pp 727-729Sarr, pp 37-39Bâ, Tamsir Ousman.

The Serer strategy was to push the Muslim Marabout forces into Somb where a strong resistance had been prepared and to prevent them from entering Thiouthioune. The strategy failed. Maba and his army successfully entered Thiouthioune. However at Thiouthioune, Maba's army faced a strong resistance by some of the retinue forces of King Amad Ngoneh of Thiouthioune, which included Maad Semou Gallo Joof and the princes: Gniba Dior Joof, Madior Latdjigué and Biram Joof. The battle took place between Somb and Thiouthioune and lasted three quarters of the morning. In the early stages of the battle, the Muslim Marabouts prevailed. The princes and Maad (King) Semou Gallo Joof were killed. The prince Mbagne Somb Faye committed suicide when he was captured by the Muslim Marabouts. Around 12 pm, it started to rain. Maba and his army took refuge in the coppices which surrounded the pond of Fandane and attempted to dry off their arms. Around that time, Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak had left Ndoffane Nomad with his army and moving towards Fandane to defend it. Before his arrival, Damel-Teigne Lat-Dior Ngoneh Latyr and Bourba Jolof Alboury Sainabou (both valiant and experienced warriors) contemplated withdrawing from the battle at around 2 pm (tisbâr time – Muslim prayer time in the afternoon). Damel-Teigne Lat Dior reported to Maba that, he had heard the sound of Sine's junjung approaching, and Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak is bound to be among them. He tried to discuss an exit strategy because the Sine army would be too strong for them. Maba was not interested in an exit strategy, his mission was to Islamize and conquer Serer Sine.Lipschutz, Mark R. and Rasmussen, R. Kent. Dictionary of African historical biography. 2nd Edition. University of California Press, 1989. . p 128 When Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak and his army, accompanied by the King of Patar; the King of Poukham and the Sandigue Ndiob arrived on the scene, they interposed between the Muslim Marabout forces and the Kingdom of Saloum locking the Marabouts in Sine and cutting off their exit route into Nioro du Rip (Maba's residence), via Saloum. Damel-Teigne Lat Dior Ngoné Latyr and Bourba Jolof Alboury Sainabou Njie realising that the cause has been lost, abandoned Maba in the battlefield. They fought their way out of the battlefield, the Damel-Teigne escaped and headed towards Cayor and the Bourba Jolof towards Gossas.Diouf, Niokhobaye. pp 728-729Klein, p 90 The Serer army defeated the Muslim Marabouts. Maba was killed at Fandane and so was the Serer Prince Makhoureja Ngoneh Joof whom according to some was responsible for killing Maba.Bâ, Abdou Bouri. Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du Rip.

Mama Gaolo was released two days after the battle to go and relay the incident in his country. After Maba had been killed, Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak had his head cut off and his limbs dismembered. He then sent an arm and the head, with a letter to the French commandant at Gorée to announce his victory.

As such, Laprade was ordered \\"to stay on the defensive\\" and told \\"he would not even receive white troops\\" to replace those who have died from disease.Klein, pp 88-89, 94 Abdoulaye Ouli Bâ (Maba's brother) was not killed in the battle. In a revenge attack, he was castrated for participating in the surprise of Mbin o Ngor, the kidnapping of Lingeer Selbeh Ndoffene Joof (Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak's daughter), forcefully marrying her and making her pregnant. Although released, he went missing for some time people thought that he had died like his two brothers (Maba and Ousmane) at the battle. He resurfaced by January 1868 during the raidings of the Mandinka principalities of Niani and Ouli, in the Gambia.Diouf, Cheikh. Fiscalité et Domination Coloniale: l'exemple du Sine: 1859-1940.

The griots of Sine beat the junjung and chanted the following hymn in his honour (the hymn is still chanted in his honour):Klein p91 ;In Serer Fap Hamad Joof Tandeh fo Kaet O or Oleh hat Fandane Dala Ngot ; Bo fud es a buta Mbai a varan'am Sun ne'n Jahu ; Ye de bgara Me Somb a ndefu Yerer a Tutun Mbai Souka Ndella A raha O ndonga'nga ; Mbel Fandane eh Talaba a naga pitit pasar Ma Samba a humna Jahu dang O lol O ndongo sima ; Ya eh!

Edinburgh University Press (1968). p 91 Controversy Senegal's Ministry of Culture states that, Maba was buried in Mbel Fandane – the mausoleum which is venerated by people in honour of Maba.See: REGION DE FATICK, Département de Fatick Commune de Fatick, entry number 12 Serer Sine's oral tradition refute this. According to the Serers of Sine, after Maba was killed, he was dismembered and his body parts scattered in various parts of the country. An arm and the head were sent to the French Commandant at Gorée accompanied by a letter from Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof. Their tradition went on to state that, the mausoleum that is venerated is that of Makhoureja Ngoneh Joof and not that of Maba Diakhou Bâ. It was Makhoureja Ngoneh who was buried there not Maba.Diouf, Niokhobaye, pp 727-729 (pp 16-18)Diagne, Pathé. pp 93-94 According to Cheikh Diouf, in a letter marked 31 July 1867 deposited at the National Archives of Senegal, the French replied to Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak's previous letter in which they asked : \\"What do you want us to do with his remains?\\"Diouf, Cheikh.
