Musical career God's Property Choir was organized and founded by a public school music teacher by the name of Linda Ray Hall-Searight in 1992 in Dallas, Texas. She along with her son, Grammy Award Winner Robert Sput Searight, and daughters, Robin and Rachella Searight were totally responsible for recruiting all of the original singers and musicians of this choir. Linda Searight groomed the choir into an exceptional performing organization that was often featured on national television shows in the mid and late 1990s. The choir began to collaborate with Kirk Franklin in 1994 and sang backup on his 1995 album, Whatcha Looking' 4. Franklin, in turn, produced and co-wrote most of the songs on the group's 1997 album (also produced by Scott \\"Shavoni\\" Parker and Buster & Kevin Bond). Kirk Franklin often works out new material with the choir in the studio and has appeared with the choir on the Late Show with David Letterman. The choir itself has performed with Celine Dion at the encore of the \\"Call The Man/Power of the Dream\\" concert in Dallas, Texas and on The 10th Annual Essence Awards in 1997 with Stevie Wonder. In 1998, a few of God's Property singers performed a few songs for Kirk Franklin's The Nu Nation Project. On November 2, 1998, God's Property sued their record label.

Migma uses self-intersecting beams of ions from small particle accelerators to force the ions to fuse. Similar systems using larger collections of particles, up to microscopic dust sized, were referred to as \\"macrons\\". Migma was an area of some research in the 1970s and early 1980s, but lack of funding precluded further development. Conventional fusion Fusion takes place when atoms come into close proximity and the nuclear strong force pulls their nuclei together. Counteracting this process is the fact that the nuclei are all positively charged, and thus repel each other due to the electrostatic force. In order for fusion to occur, the nuclei must have enough energy to overcome this coulomb barrier. The barrier is lowered for atoms with less positive charge, those with the fewest protons, and the strong force is increased with additional nucleons, the total number of protons and neutrons. This means that a combination of deuterium and tritium has the lowest coulomb barrier, at about 100 keV (see requirements for fusion). When the fuel is heated to high energies the electrons disassociate from the nuclei, which are left as ions in a gas-like plasma. Any particles in a gas are distributed across a wide range of energies in a spectrum known as the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution. At any given temperature the majority of the particles are at lower energies, with a \\"long tail\\" containing smaller numbers of particles at much higher energies. So while 100 KeV represents a temperature of over one billion degrees, in order to produce fusion events the fuel does not have to be heated to this temperature as a whole. Even at a much lower temperature, the rate of fusion may be high enough to provide useful power output as long as it is confined for some period of time. Increased density also increases the rate, as the energy from the reactions will heat the surrounding fuel and potentially incite fusion in it as well. The combination of temperature, density and confinement time is known as the Lawson criterion. Two primary approaches have developed to attack the fusion energy problem. In the inertial confinement approach the fuel is quickly squeezed to extremely high densities, increasing the internal temperature in the process. There is no attempt to maintain these conditions for any period of time, the fuel explodes outward as soon as the force is released. The confinement time is on the order of nanoseconds, so the temperatures and density have to be very high in order to any appreciable amount of the fuel to undergo fusion. This approach has been successful in producing fusion reactions, but to date the devices that can provide the compression, typically lasers, require more energy than the reactions produce. In the more widely studied magnetic confinement approach, the plasma, which is electrically charged, is confined with magnetic fields. The fuel is slowly heated until some of the fuel in the tail of the temperature distribution starts undergoing fusion. At the temperatures and densities that are possible using magnets the fusion process is fairly slow, so this approach requires long confinement times on the order of tens of seconds, or even minutes. Confining a gas at millions of degrees for this sort of time scale has proven difficult, although modern experimental machines are approaching the conditions needed for net power production. Migma fusion The colliding beam approach avoided the problem of heating the mass of fuel to these temperatures by accelerating the ions directly in a particle accelerator. The simple way to make such a system is to take two accelerators and aim them at each other. However, the chance that two ions will collide is infinitesimal; most of the ions would fly by each other and their energy would be lost. In order to make such a system practical in energy terms, the particles need to be recirculated so they have many chances to collide. One way to do this is to use a storage ring, but those ions that come close to a reaction scatter out at high angles that make them exit the rings. Simple mathematics showed this approach would not work; the loss rate from these near misses would always be much higher than the energy gained from fusion reactions. Maglich's concept modified the arrangement based on a new particle storage concept he had co- invented, known as the \\"precetron\\". In a typical storage ring concept, the particles are fired into the ring \\"end on\\" with a specific energy so they follow the path of the ring. In contrast, in the precetron the storage area is a magnetic mirror. In most magnetic mirror arrangements the average particle energy is relatively low and the ions and electrons have relatively small orbits around the magnetic lines of force, much smaller in radius than the diameter of the mirror as a whole. In the precetron, the ions have much higher energies, and thus much larger orbits, taking up a significant portion of the mirror's diameter, about to . In this arrangement, the ions will tend to move towards the center of the mirror volume, instead of reflecting back and forth between the ends as in the classical mirror setup. Additionally, due to the arrangement of the fields, with the field being stronger at the outside of the volume, the ion orbits will precess around the inner area. This causes the circular path to move its center of rotation. For instance, if the particle is initially fired into the storage area so that it is orbiting around the bottom half of the mirror area, it will slowly move so the orbit is on one side, then the top, the other side, and then the bottom again. If one traces out the path of a single ion over time, it forms a pattern similar to that of a Spirograph, creating a series of circles that fill the volume. The key to using this concept in the migma system was to fire the ions into the chamber with the right energy so that their paths passed through the geometric center of the mirror. After a short time, this orbit would precess away from the initial entry point. When another ion is fired in, it takes up the original orbit. Over time, the chamber would fill with ions orbiting within what was effectively an infinite number of storage rings all intersecting in the center. And because they met in the center, ions on opposite sided of the chamber were moving in opposite directions when they met, so a single accelerator produced an effect similar to two accelerators and two storage rings in the conventional layout. A great advantage of this approach is that forward scattering of the ions in \\"missed\\" reactions would simply move them to a different orbit, but their natural movement in the mirror field would rapidly bring them back to the center. It was only those ions that scattered to a large off-axis angle that would escape. As a result, it was expected that any given ion would take about 108 orbits through the reaction area before scattering out of the system. The term \\"migma\\", from the Greek word for \\"mixture\\", was chosen to distinguish this mass of orbiting ions from the plasma in conventional machines. Reactors A series of four Migma reactors were built; the original Migma (retroactively, Migma I) in 1973, Migma II in 1975, Migma III in 1976, and eventually culminating with the Migma IV in 1982. These devices were relatively small, only a few meters long along the accelerator beamline with a disk-shaped target chamber about in diameter and thick. Migma testbed devices used accelerators of about 1 MeV,Migma IV High Energy Fusion Apperatus to 2 MeV. The Migma designs aimed at using aneutronic fuels, most notably D-He3 reaction, which requires much higher temperatures to reach ignition than the typical D-T reaction. Migma II managed to reach the required temperature, about 15 billion degrees, in 1975. Migma IV set a record for confinement time of 25 seconds in 1982, as well as the record fusion triple product (density √ó energy-confinement-time √ó mean energy) of keV sec cm‚àí3, a record that was not approached by a conventional tokamak until JET achieved keV sec cm‚àí3 in 1987. To make a Migma large enough to produce net energy, the triple product reached by Migma IV would have to be increased between 100 and 1000 times. Maglich attempted to secure funding for a follow- on design for some time, unsuccessfully. According to an article in The Scientist, Maglich has been involved in an acrimonious debate with the various funding agencies since the 1980s. Problems When the Migma design was first being considered, it was modelled using particle accelerator techniques. There was no deep consideration of the beta of the design, the ratio of the magnetic field to the plasma pressure. In conventional designs, like the traditional mirror, beta is a key performance figure that indicates how powerful the magnets would need to be for any given amount of fuel inside the reactor. The cost of the magnets scales with the power, so this gives a rough estimate of the economics of the reactor. In Migma, there is no plasma in the conventional sense, so it was not clear that this consideration applied - as long as one matched the field to the energy of the ions so they remained confined, the technical needs were met. But the continual feeding of ions leads to an obvious problem, the reaction chamber would become increasingly positively charged. This produced an outward pressure that was similar to the pressure from a conventional plasma caused by the ideal gas law. Eventually, this pressure would overwhelm the magnetic field, regardless of the energy of the particles. To stay below this limit, the density of the particles had to be very low, about that of a typical mirror design. One could offset this effect by injecting electrons as well as ions, so that the macroscopic volume is neutralized. However, this leads to two new effects that cause energy to be lost from the reactor. One is that the electrons will randomly impact the ions, causing them to neutralize, meaning they are no longer subject to the magnetic field and free to leave the reaction chamber. Even when such neutralization did not occur, the impacts between the electrons and ions would cause the electrons to release energy through both bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation. At some critical electron density, these losses will be greater than the amount of energy fed into the system by the accelerators. To address this, the designs intended to operate with very low electron counts, on the order of one electron for every 100 ions. This leads to a significant limitation on the possible operating parameters of the design; if the electron counts are low the density of the fuel must be low to avoid the positive charge overwhelming the magnets, but if the electron density is increased to allow higher fuel density, the losses begin to increase through electron effects. In order to improve this figure, it was suggested that a second accelerator fire electrons into the chamber as well; if electrons met ions they would neutralize, and as such, they would no longer be subject to the magnetic fields and leave the chamber. The key to making this work would be to send the electrons into the center, where the slower ions that were no longer useful were massing. Free electrons were also to be scavenged by devices in the reactor chamber. In the late 1990s, a generalized consideration of these issues suggested that the Migma was not alone in this problem; when one considers bremsstrahlung in non-thermalized fuels, it appears that no system running on aneutronic fuels can approach ignition, that any system using non- thermalized fuels (including Migma) appear to be able to cover their losses. The only approach that appears to have a theoretical possibility of working is the D-T or perhaps D-D reaction in a thermalized plasma mass.

The Department of Fish and Wildlife manages and protects the state's fish, wildlife, wildflowers, trees, mushrooms, algae (kelp) and native habitats (ecosystems). The Department is responsible for regulatory enforcement and management of related recreational, commercial, scientific, and educational uses. The Department also prevent illegal poaching. History The Game Act was passed in 1852 by the California State Legislature and signed into law by Governor John Bigler. The Game Act closed seasons in 12 counties for quail, partridge, mallard and wood ducks, elk, deer, and antelope. A second legislative action enacted the same year protected salmon runs. In 1854, the Legislature extended the act to include all counties of California. In 1860, protection controls were extended for trout. Lake Merritt (Oakland, California) was made the first game refuge of California in 1869, believed to be the first in the United States. In 1870, the Legislature, with the support of Governor Henry Huntly Haight, created the Board of Fish Commissioners. The Board stipulated that fish ladders were now required at state dams. The Board outlawed explosives or other deleterious substances, and created a $500 fine for violations. In 1870, the first fish ladder in the state was built on a tributary of the Truckee River, and a state hatching house was established at the University of California in Berkeley. In 1871, the state appointed the first Game Wardens to handle wildlife law enforcement, making the Enforcement Division of the Department of Fish and Game the first state law enforcement agency enacted in California. Over the next 30 years, the Board of Fish Commissioners were given authority over game in the state as well as establishing hunting and fishing licenses. In 1909, the Board of Fish Commissioners changed its name to the Fish and Game Commission. The Division of Fish and Game was established in 1927, set up within the Department of Natural Resources. In 1951, the Reorganization Act elevated the Division of Fish and Game to the Department of Fish and Game (DFG). California Fish and Game also collaborated with the indigenous Native American Tribes to ensure their proper fishing rights. The Yurok tribe has collaborated with them as recently as 2011.Buckskin, Marjorie. Yurok Tribe MLPA and Marine Resource Plan Factual Record of Marine Resource Use. Klamath: Yurok Tribe, 15 Sept. 2011. PDF. http://www.yuroktribe.org/government/tribalattorney/documents/2011.08.29_YurokTribe- FactualRecordtoCAFGC.pdf The Department also helped figure out the official count of fish killed (which was around 30,000) in the 2002 Fish Kill on the Klamath River. The Klamath river is very important to the tribes that live along that river. By 2012, California was one of only 13 states still using \\"Game\\" in the title of their wildlife agency. The State Legislature changed the Department's name to Fish and Wildlife on January 1, 2013. The legislation followed recommendations of a 51-member stakeholder advisory group. 18 other states use the term \\"wildlife,\\" while the others generally use \\"natural resources\\" or \\"conservation,\\" in the titles of their Departments. This change reflects the trend toward expansion of the Agencies' missions from sport fishing and hunting alone, to protection of non-game wildlife and whole ecosystems. In June 2015, the CDFW phased out lead ammunition for hunting on state land in order to keep lead out of backcountry ecosystems. Regional divisions The Department of Fish and Wildlife divides the State of California into seven management regions whose boundaries mostly correspond to county borders (with the exception of Sacramento, Yolo, and San Joaquin counties). *Northern Region: Del Norte, Humboldt, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Shasta, Siskiyou, Tehama and Trinity counties. *North Central Region: Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, El Dorado, Glenn, Lake, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Sierra, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties. *Bay Delta Region: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, Sacramento, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, San Joaquin, Solano, Sonoma, and Yolo counties. *Central Region: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Stanislaus, Tulare and Tuolumne counties. *South Coast Region: Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. *Inland Deserts Region: Imperial, Inyo, Mono, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. *Marine Region: includes the entire coastline of California. Law Enforcement Division The department employs wardens to protect California's wildlife and natural resources. CDFW wardens are armed law enforcement officers with statewide arrest authority. Their primary mission is to enforce California state laws related to hunting, fishing, pollution, endangered species, and wildlife habitat destruction. However, they can enforce any state law, anywhere in the state. Vehicles used range from the patrol pickups to boats, catamarans, four-wheelers, snow-mobiles, horses, helicopters, and planes. The wardens investigate, collect evidence, serve search warrants, arrest criminals, and ensure public safety. Wardens patrol the state of California and off the coast. As of 2014, about 380 wardens patrolled the state.2008 Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, by Brian A Reaves, US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, July 2011 Merging the Law Enforcement Division into the California Highway Patrol has been discussed, similar to how Alaska has a Wildlife Trooper division within the Alaska State Troopers.California Fish and Game Commission Meeting March 6, 2008A how-to guide in revamping woeful DFG Tom Stienstra, San Francisco Chronicle, December 8, 2002 Given that the CDFW Law Enforcement Division has faced low numbers of Wildlife Officers for the last ten years.A world without game wardens? ESPN, March 6, 2008Game- warden shortage is about to get worse San Francisco Chronicle, September 23, 2007 =Marine officers= The Marine Region officers patrol the entire coastline of California, and up to 200 miles off the shore. Marine officers enforce commercial and sport fishing laws through spot checks on the water and on land. As of 2001, the Marine Region was patrolled by 63 officers piloting 65-foot, 54-foot, and 40-foot mono-hull patrol vessels and 18-foot and 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable patrol boats. Some rigid-hull inflatable boats are carried on the larger patrol vessels, while others are carried on trailers to respond to emergencies on the north coast. =Special Operations Unit= The Special Operations Unit (SOU) is CDFW's investigative unit. The SOU investigates crimes related to improper use of California's natural resources, including poaching of fish and game. The unit accomplishes this with a combination of physical surveillance and undercover operations. =Pilots= The CDFW operates an Air Services unit for the purposes of aerial surveillance, fish stocking, and transportation. All CDFW pilots are fully qualified peace officers, pilots, and airplane mechanics. They are responsible for maintaining their own aircraft, and fly out of Hemet, Fresno, Sacramento, and Redding. Office of Spill Prevention and Response The Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) is a branch of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife that is tasked with responding to pollution and protecting the wildlife of California. The OSPR has authority over all surface waters in California, both inland and up to 200 miles off the coast. The funding for the OSPR's Oil Spill Prevention Administration Fund comes from a fee placed on every barrel of crude oil entering California. . Wildlife Forensics Laboratory The CDFW Wildlife Forensics Laboratory is a forensic laboratory that uses molecular biology to investigate crimes against animals. The lab is staffed by three wildlife forensic specialists who help CDFW officers identify species, determine the biological sex of an animal, and determine whether two samples are from the same animal. California Fish and Game Commission The California Fish and Game Commission is an organ of the California state government, and is separate from the CDFW. Although the Department's name was recently modified by changing the word \\"Game\\" to \\"Wildlife\\", no such name change has occurred for the Commission. California Fish and Wildlife in the Media CDFW officers were followed by the National Geographic Channel show \\"Wild Justice\\" in 2010 and 2011.

It tells the story of a builder in a small town who falls for a glamorous but treacherous femme fatale, with tragic results for both. It is notable as the only occasion in which the two major stars Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich, lovers in real life, appeared together on screen. Plot In a little country town, Martin Roumagnac is a building contractor who is liked by the ordinary people. He lives in a shack with his sister while he builds a villa on a plot he has bought. Into town with her uncle comes Blanche Ferrand, an exotic widow who married the owner of the seed and grain shop shortly before his death. Her target for next husband is Laubry, a retired diplomat with a dying wife, and while waiting she has an occasional lover. She also has to fend off a besotted schoolteacher. One evening, feeling the need for some excitement, she goes to a boxing match and sits next to the ebullient Martin. Soon the two are lovers, and when Martin finishes his villa he gives it to her (thereby losing its capital value and depressing his creditworthiness). Though passionate in private, she finds his lack of refinement embarrassing in public: he drinks only Pernod and chain-smokes Gauloises. He cannot fully understand her more sophisticated take on life, and her love of Paris, where she feels alive, and he feels out of place. But the love between them is very real, and deeper than anything either of them has experienced before. His business suffers from his obsession and he is running out of cash. He is increasingly disturbed by the gossip in the town about him and Blanche. He expected her upper class friends to say he wasn't good enough for her, but he hears the same snickering asides from his own friends and family. When Laubry's wife dies, Blanche looks forward to a profitable alliance with him, where she will be free to have lovers if she pleases; but Laubry insists she must first break with Martin‚Äînot because he cares if she is faithful, but because the lower social standing of the 'bricklayer' would damage her in the eyes of the social circles they would be moving in. His contemptuous words about Martin enrage her, and she accuses him of giving her his wife's corpse as a wedding gift. This makes the match impossible, and he leaves. She also rejects the offer of a local suitor, the deputy mayor of the town, who says he'll improve Martin's business prospects, and then he and Martin can share her. Enraged at the men in her life and at herself, she sells the shop, and resolves to leave the town forever. She releases the birds, wanting them to be free, even though they are not native, and will die in the winter. Martin, knowing nothing of her having dismissed her other suitors in favor of him, and believing she is going to marry the consul, goes to the villa to confront her, and she is too proud to tell him the truth. In his rage, he strangles her, and the villa catches on fire, destroying all the evidence. He goes home in shock and reveals what he did. His sister promises him an alibi and enlists the postman as a witness, turning the clock back, so that it will seem to the usually drunken postman that Martin was having lunch when the crime took place. His trial is going badly for him until under questioning Blanche's uncle (who was not really her uncle at all, but a former lover and mentor who she formed a lasting friendship with) reveals that from her teens she had many men (Martin, forgetting his peril, protests this line of attack from his attorney, saying he doesn't want her reputation smeared). But even while exonerating Martin, lying about how he saw no anger in him shortly before the murder, the old man aims a telling emotional blow when he reveals that she had rejected the consul and his wealth, because of the man's petty snobbery towards the 'bricklayer.' Martin now feels the full impact of what he has done, the injustice he has committed towards the only woman he ever loved. The jury acquits him unanimously and he goes home to a party organized by his sister, whose perjury was believed. In the shadows is the rebuffed teacher, who has been watching the entire trial, watching Martin closely, seeing his reaction to the revelation that she had, in fact, been true to him in her heart. Martin sees the young man in the barn, watching him, holding a gun. He deliberately turns his back, silhouetted in the open window, waiting for the shots he knows are coming, while he smokes his last Gauloise.

It is located off the shore along the main road from Paphos to Limassol. The combination of the beauty of the area and its status in mythology as the birthplace of Aphrodite makes it a popular tourist location. The sea in this region is generally rough, persuading tourists not to swim there. It is not permitted to climb the rock. A restaurant, a tourist pavilion and the Aphrodite Hills resort are nearby.  Legends  According to one legend, this rock is the site of the birth of the goddess Aphrodite, perhaps owing to the foaming waters around the rock fragments, and for this reason it is known as Aphrodite's Rock. Gaia (Mother Earth) asked one of her sons, Cronus, to mutilate his father, Uranus (Sky). Cronus cut off Uranus' testicles and threw them into the sea. Similarly, the local version indicates that Aphrodite‚Äôs Rock is a part of the lower body of Uranus. This legend says that Cronus ambushed his father http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm  put in his hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot. and cut him below the waist with a scythe. Uranus, as he tried to escape flying, lost parts of his truncated body and testicles into the sea. A white foam appeared from which a maiden arose, the waves first taking her to Kythera and then bringing her to Cyprus. The maiden, named Aphrodite, went to the assembly of gods from Cyprus. The Romans widely referred to her as Venus. Aphrodite attracted a large cult following in Paphos, which was eventually crushed by the Romans. This is evident from the Sanctuary of Aphrodite in Old Paphos, Kouklia. A local myth is that any person who swims around the Aphrodite Rock will be blessed with eternal beauty. Another legend associates the name Achni with the nearby beach, and attributes this to it being a site where the Achaeans came ashore on their return from Troy. The present name Petra tou Romiou (\\"Rock of the Roman\\") associates the place with the exploits of the hero Basil as told in the Digenes Akritas. Basil was half-Byzantine (East Roman or Romios) and half-Arabic, hence the name Digenes (two-blood). Legend tells that the Christian Basil hurled a huge rock from the Troodos Mountains to keep off the invading Saracens. A nearby rock is similarly known as the Saracen Rock.

The story revolves around the life of a baby vampire who comes into the lives of two siblings, who take him home to England and eventually grow to love and care for him like their own son. It was followed by five sequels: Vlad the Drac Returns, Vlad the Drac Superstar, Vlad the Drac Vampire, Vlad the Drac Down Under, and Vlad the Drac Goes Travelling. Story Paul and Judy Stone, along with their parents, are on a coach tour in the mountains of Romania. As they play in the snow, they discover a baby vampire who was asleep underneath a stone Paul fell on. Astonished that the vampire is harmless and fluent in English, Paul and Judy learn that the vampire is in fact a vegetarian who faints at the sight of blood. Before the coach can leave, the vampire begs Paul and Judy to take him with them, which they reluctantly do. After the coach arrives at their hotel, Paul and Judy hide the vampire from their parents, and immediately think up a name for their new friend: Vlad, which the vampire happily accepts. Vlad also reveals that he has a strange diet, which includes a love for certain chemicals like washing-up liquid and bars of soap. Paul, Judy and Vlad safely arrive back in England without revealing Vlad to their parents. But looking after Vlad brings many problems, such as Paul and Judy having to spend most of their pocket money on soap and washing-up liquid. After returning home from school one day, while their parents are still out (Mr Stone is a violinist, and Mrs Stone is a doctor), Paul and Judy find that Vlad has been up to mischief, especially after they forbade him to explore the house while they were out. They find the kitchen covered in blood, and a proud Vlad tells them that he has apparently devoured the Milkman, the Window Cleaner and Gasman. Paul and Judy panic, until they find a broken bottle of tomato ketchup in the bin. Furious at Vlad, Paul and Judy shut him up in Judy's room for a day. After seeing the television schedule on Friday, Vlad notices a film entitled The Curse of the Vampire, which he begs the children to allow him to watch. Luckily, the parents are going out that evening, which allows them to watch the movie and go to bed before they return. However, when the scary scenes of the film start, Vlad hides under a pillow, unable to watch any longer, and begs the children to take him to bed. That night, Vlad comes to Judy and complains about a nightmare he had about the film. Judy allows Vlad to sleep with her. One day, after Paul and Judy come home early due to bad weather, Vlad learns to fly, much to his delight. Then, Mr Stone comes home with a box of ice cream and two tickets to a football match, to which he is going to take Paul. But after Mr Stone is out of earshot, Vlad begs Paul to take him to the football match, and Paul accepts. However, on the day of the match, Mr Stone and Paul come home earlier than expected, beaten and battered. Paul appears to be in very deep trouble for bad behaviour, when in secret it was Vlad who unintentionally got Paul into trouble by using racist language with a group of Scotsmen, and shouting \\"Up the Arsenal\\". While Paul and Vlad's friendship appears to have ended, Judy speaks to Paul and asks him to give Vlad another chance. Reluctantly, Paul forgives Vlad. It's Christmas time, and Paul and Judy are preparing for the celebrations. By now, Paul has long been forgiven by his father. For Christmas, Paul and Judy get a puppy, and Vlad gets a book titled The Dracula Legend, although he is still scared of the puppy. During the holidays, Gran and Aunt Margot (Mrs Stone's mother and sister) come to visit, but both get mysteriously bitten on the ankle. Immediately deducing that the puppy is the culprit, Mr Stone and Paul take the puppy back to the pet shop, but Judy knows that Vlad was behind it, and he confesses, claiming that eventually the puppy would have harmed or killed him. Almost a year has passed since the trip to Romania, and Judy decides to take Vlad to school with her one-day, under the condition that he stay silent. But in a classroom, when the teacher, Miss Fairfax, notices Judy writing an essay about vampires, she starts to knock the subject down by telling Judy that vampires don't exist. Too much for him to handle, Vlad flies onto the desk and scolds Miss Fairfax, causing her to faint. Judy and Paul now realise that their secret has come to an end, for their parents are surely going to find out. That evening, Mr and Mrs Stone receive a phone call from the school headmaster about Vlad, which Mr Stone angrily scoffs, but decides to ask the children anyway. Then, it happens: Vlad finally reveals himself to Mr and Mrs Stone, who are shocked but fascinated to meet the friendly little vampire. Mrs Stone then makes a plan with Vlad to make him famous: which would consist of Vlad returning to Romania and allowing many people to visit him. Excited, Vlad packs his things straight away. The day of Vlad's departure arrives, and he leaves for Romania after bidding farewell to his friends. Two years later, the Stones re-visit Romania, and find that Vlad is now living in Count Dracula's castle, has met a female vampire (Mrs Vlad), and started a family, naming his children after his loved ones (his first daughter named Judy; his first son named Paul; his second daughter named Mum; his second son named Dad; and his third son named Ghitza). They also see that Vlad's piano running skills have improved, now that he knows how to play Chopin's Revolutionary, a piece Mr Stone never learned.

It originally aired on BBC Two from 11 January to 22 March 1994. The story was 10 episodes long and focused heavily on pollution. It has been repeated many times since the original broadcast, as recently as 2009. Story One hundred years ago, Aliens sent a probe to Earth. The purpose of this probe was to monitor the pollution levels of the Earth. One day the probe surfaces and detects a high pollution level and signals the aliens. An alien, named Ollie, comes to investigate the town of Southbeach because of the probe. The town is also suffering from a mysterious illness found in the children, apparently due to pollutants being pumped into the sea by a local factory. The local children befriend Ollie, who informs them that the pollution in Earth's atmosphere is causing things created by his species ‚Äì like the probe ‚Äì to malfunction. He also informs them that the malfunctioning probe is going to explode. This would start a chain reaction that would destroy Southbeach. Characters *Ollie A plump little alien from the planet Gia- 'Ollie' is merely an approximate version of his name, as his real name is unpronounceable in English-, who comes to Earth to investigate after receiving a signal from the probe, (Charlie), his species sent. He has the ability to turn invisible and shrink. He possesses a mysterious ball which can be used to fix broken and/or damaged objects and cure the illness being caused by the pollutants (Although he claims that this feature cannot be used too often). He also can summon his hidden spaceship by whistling. Prolonged exposure to Earth's atmosphere makes him uncoordinated and will gradually weaken him. *Martin One of the three friends who are amongst the first to encounter Ollie. His mother owns a hotel which is doing badly due to the mysterious illness. He also has Asthma, although it is unclear whether Ollie's mysterious ball cures him along with those infected with the mysterious virus. During the series he briefly betrays Ollie to try to save the hotel, although he later pretends to be Ollie to draw the resulting officials away. *Amina One of the three friends who are amongst the first to encounter Ollie. She greatly cares for the environment and wishes that all people could be bothered to care as well, she is also headstrong and takes the role as leader of the group. It is revealed that Ollie chose to reveal himself to her because he could sense her caring nature and thought she could help him. In the series to cover for Olle's increasing hunger and clumsiness, she pretends that she can do magic to account for some of the objects he has knocked over while invisible, which gets the attention of the press. During their investigation into the pollution, she gets sick. This is cured by Ollie using his mysterious ball, which Ollie later gives to her before his departure after she used it to cure him of his weakness. *Jenny One of the three friends who are amongst the first to encounter Ollie; she is interested in journalism, spending most of the series making notes of their experiences. She also cares deeply for Martin and persuades Amina and Ollie that he is a good person. Her judgement seems to be misplaced briefly when Martin betrays Ollie to Lowin, but soon after her beliefs are confirmed when Martin draws the authorities away from Ollie. *Mrs. Rowlands Martin's mother, manager of The Burlington Hotel where the children conceal Ollie, throughout the series she constantly tries to keep from selling the hotel to Mr. Belcher, almost doing so in one episode. At the end of the series the events of the series cause mass bookings and make the hotel a success again. *Joe Lowin A reporter investigating the mysterious illness. He is the one who persuades Martin to betray Ollie. He has a desire to make it big and get a big story for his paper \\"The Daily News\\", he dislikes other reporters, which is shown in the way he speaks to Sarah, at the end of the series when the children give their story to Sarah first he quits the reporting business. Although in the educational section of the programme (which takes place a year later), he is referred to by Chris and Sarah as though he's become a member of staff of the Gasset. *Mr. Belcher A factory owner dumping dangerous waste into the sea, and attempting to conceal this activity. He repeatedly attempts to buy the hotel from Martin's mother, he nearly succeeds at one point, although he later comes to realise the danger of his actions when his daughter, Clare, becomes sick from the illness. He is arrested and fined at the end of the series after the authorities find out about his illegal activities, although he redeems himself by helping Ollie reach the probe before it explodes at the last minute. *Sarah Brightly A reporter from \\"The Southbeach Gazette\\" as well as the narrator of the story and one of the 3 characters in the education section of the episodes, she is Jenny's role model and an Eco Warrior. Throughout the series, she tries to find the cause of the illness, she even takes an interest when Anita starts doing magic. *Chef played by Mark Benton One of the staff working at the hotel, He seems to be fond of Mrs. Rowlands and his constant jokes are a source of annoyance to Martin. On a walk near the river he starts whistling, Ollie's ship hears him, and, thinking Ollie is summoning it, rises to find him, seeing that it isn't Ollie it utters a low growling apology and returns to the depths. After the experience the Chef tries to forget about it, but has a hard time, with everything else going on. *Jenny's Dad He initially works in Mr. Belcher's factory, but later refuses to continue due to the potential damage the job is causing to the environment and quits when Anita falls ill, even though Belcher claims to have fired him first. At the end of the series, he gets his job back, under a new and eco-friendly boss. *Clare Mr. Belcher's daughter, she spends most of the series in her father's car and in silence, when Amina falls ill she rushes to help, ignoring her father's orders to return to the car, but she becomes infected when helping the kids. Seeing her in this state, her father begins to see the error of his ways, but it isn't until she stops him from turning in Ollie that he truly sees what he did wrong, so although not the most important character, she is somewhat the most powerful character. *Z.o.t. A language probe, who resides in Sarah's computer, one of the 3 characters in the education section of the episodes, in this series he replaces the character of \\"Wordy\\" as the 'animated' educator of the show. His name apparently stands for \\"Zero in On Target\\", he can either be summoned by either Sarah or Chris tapping the space bar three times or can summon himself into existence, he has stores of information on language and whenever he accesses one of them he shouts \\"Zot\\", beaming the information onto the computer. He introduces many different characters including News Hound, Bill the Brickie, Ellie (Ollie's Sister), Gussy Gunge, Lazer Larry and the Magic E Magician. *Chris A work experience student, Sarah expected a girl but she left school and when Chris joined the school he was chosen to replace her, not the brightest of people, he and Zot have their heated moments, but he learns keenly and quickly, he even attempts to copy Zot by summoning Bill The Brickie, but fails. At the end of the series his story makes the front page of the Gasset. *Ellie The sister of Ollie. She is shown in the educational section of the show and features in a few songs, one of which is entitled \\"I'm Ellie the sister of Ollie.\\" References Category:1994 British television series debuts Category:1994 British television series endings Category:1990s British children's television series Category:BBC children's television shows Category:British television shows for schools Category:Look and Read Category:English-language television shows Category:1990s British science fiction television series ","title":"Earth Warp"},{"id":"8000247","title":"Eswatini national rugby union team"},{"id":"8000249","text":"Anthony Richard Tonkin (born 17 January 1980) is an English retired footballer who played as a defender. Career Born in Penzance, Cornwall, Tonkin began his career at Mousehole and Falmouth Town, where he finished as runners-up to Truro City in the South Western League in the 1997‚Äì98 season. His success with Falmouth attracted Yeovil Town, who signed him up in 1998, where he made 95 appearances and scored one goal in three years at the club. In 2002, he moved to Stockport County, where he spent a year before being transferred to Crewe Alexandra in August 2003 for a reported fee of ¬£150,000. After more than 90 appearances in under three years, he was released and subsequently returned to Yeovil. On 2 March 2007, he joined Grays Athletic on loan for the remainder of the season. He was released by Yeovil upon his return in May 2007. Two months later, he signed for Conference National club Forest Green Rovers, reportedly turning down Football League clubs to stay in the Southwest. He made 38 league appearances as the club finished in their highest-ever league placing, but was released at the end of the season. Tonkin joined Cambridge United on 1 July 2008. In January 2010, Tonkin joined Oxford United for an undisclosed fee. In May 2012, Tonkin was released by the club after being deemed surplus to requirements. On 25 May 2012, Tonkin joined Aldershot Town on a one-year deal which sees him join former teammate Josh Payne at the Recreation Ground.

The lake is famous for its coarse fishing (particularly pike), watersports, the (nicknamed 'Gorsey') and has the only example of a crannog in Wales. Llangorse Lake is also one of the most mentioned sites in Welsh folklore. It is a site of international conservation importance. Due to the lake's long history of human activity, it has been known by several different names during its history, both in the Welsh language and in English: other names include the lake's original Welsh name, , and Mere. The name Llangorse Lake is comparatively recent. Geography Llangorse Lake is a eutrophic glacial lake with a circumference covering an area of . The lake is long and above sea level. The lake is sited between the basins of the River Wye to the north and the River Usk to the south, and occupies a glacially scoured rock basin partly enhanced by morainic debris.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map sheet 214 Talgarth and accompanying sheet explanation The Afon Llynfi provides the main input of water into the lake and continues as the lake overflow stream. The lake has a maximum depth of 7.5m. Llangorse Lake viewed from Mynydd Llangorse Natural history The lake is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and has long been regarded as a place where fish and birds are found in unusually high numbers. Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis) mentioned the abundance of waterfowl in his topographical work, The Description of Wales in the 12th century. It is a Special Area of Conservation (under the EU Habitats Directive) as an example of a natural nutrient-rich lake with pondweeds. The supposed largest pike caught by rod in the UK was caught in Llangorse Lake in 1846 by O. Owen and supposedly weighed , but this is unsubstantiated. If true, it would have been the largest pike in the world. The largest pike in the UK was actually caught from Llandegfedd Reservoir near Pontypool and weighed . More recently the skull of a pike of unknown weight, though undoubtedly large (35‚Äì40+ lb), was found on the shores of the lake in 2004; it was taken away by the Environment Agency for age testing. The Llangasty Nature Reserve forms an important protected area around the lake's boundary. The lake is a habitat of the Scarce Blue-tailed Damselfly (Ishnura pumilio). In May 2011 hundreds of water voles were released near Llangorse Lake in an ongoing programme to try to restore their numbers. History =Crannog= The crannog The crannog is a small artificial island about from the north shore. It is constructed of massive planks of oak behind which was built a dwelling platform formed from layers of stone, soil and brushwood. It was investigated by archaeologists from the National Museum of Wales between 1989 and 1993. Finds included a high quality textile and a bronze hinge from an 8th-9th century reliquary decorated in a style similar to that seen in Ireland. The 1993 dig was joined by the TV series Time Team and featured in series one, episode four in 1994. In 2005, works were carried out to protect the island from erosion. =Dugout boat= In 1925, archaeologists discovered a virtually complete dugout boat. Radiocarbon dating indicates that it originated from the 9th century. =Fort= In 916 √Üthelfl√¶d, Lady of the Mercians, sent an army into Brycheiniog to avenge the murder of the Mercian abbot Ecbryht and his companions. The Mercian army seized and burnt the royal fort on Llangorse Lake, and took the Queen of Brycheiniog and thirty-three others captive. Llangorse Lake in literature As Lake Leucara, the lake (and surrounding area) features in the works of Raymond Williams, who wrote People of the Black Mountains detailing the lives of ordinary people in the area at intervals from 30,000 years ago through to mediaeval times. In his diary of the 1870s, Francis Kilvert noted several visits to Llangorse Lake, including a July 1878 outing in the company of his father, when the pair caught a brace of perch in an hour. Gorsey, the Afanc of Llangorse Lake The earliest known surviving literary reference to the afanc or lake monster of Llangorse is in a poem by the 15th century Welsh poet or bard, Lewys Glyn Cothi (English translation by John Rhys): :Yr avanc er ei ovyn :Wyv yn llech ar vin y llyn; :O don Llyn Syfaddon vo :Ni thynwyd ban aeth yno: :Ni'm tyn men nag ychain gwaith, :Oddiyma heddyw ymaith. :The afanc am I, who, sought for, bides :In hiding on the edge of the lake; :Out of the waters of Syfaddon Mere :Was be not drawn, once he got there. :So with me: nor wain nor oxen wont to toil :Me to-day will draw from here forth. The afanc would have been well known in local folklore at the time of the composition of the poem. Oll Lewis, an ecologist and cryptozoologist at the Centre for Fortean Zoology, has been studying the Afanc of Llangorse Lake for several years, and has proposed that it may represent sightings of the abnormally large pike of the lake. Adrian Lloyd Jones of the Welsh Beaver Project believes that afanc stories in Wales are folk memories of the presence of beavers. (The modern Welsh word for beaver is afanc).

The club was founded in 1912 as a result of a merger and was formerly known as Athl√©tic Club Arles, but in 2010, moved to the nearby commune of Avignon and adopted its current name. Arles-Avignon last played in the Championnat de France Amateur, the fourth division in French football; it previously gained four promotions in five seasons to reach Ligue 1 in 2010. Arles-Avignon played its home matches at the Parc des Sports in nearby Avignon. The team was managed by former football player Franck Dumas and captained by defender S√©bastien Cantini, who joined the club in 2012, after a five-year stint in Italy. In France, it has been commonplace to describe Arles-Avignon as an overachieving club primarily due to succeeding despite limited resources. Arles-Avignon's highest honour was winning its group in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football, in 2007. Regionally, the club has won the Division Honneur Sud-Est Ouest three times and its reserve team are the current defending champions of the M√©diterran√©e Division Honneur R√©gionale. Arles-Avignon was known locally as Les Lions (The Lions) and incorporated the nickname into a multitude of club's fixtures, most notably its crest. After merging with Avignon, the club unveiled its new crest on 4 June 2009. The crest combined both elements of each club's predecessors and inscribed on the crest is Pays d'Arles Grand Avignon, which pays tribute to the inhabitants of the city of Arles and Grand Avignon, the metropolitan area that encompasses the commune of Avignon. In 2010, the club changed its crest again to coincide with its promotion to Ligue 1. It was dissolved in 2016.  History  Athl√©tic Club Arles-Avignon was founded on 19 December 1912 under the name Athletic Club Arl√©sien as a result of a merger between three local clubs: La P√©dale Joyeuse, Arles Auto-V√©lo, and Arles Sports. The spent its early years playing in the Ligue du Sud-Est. To remain financially sound due to the onset of World War II, Arles merged with two clubs; Club Ouvrier and Sports cheminots with the new club retaining Arles' previous name. After the war, in 1954, the club reached the Championnat de France amateur under the leadership of manager Louis Pons. In 1960, Arles went through another merger, this time with local club Jeunesse Sportive Arl√©s. The merger was influenced by Honor√© Autier, a former football player for FC S√®te. In the Arles' ensuing season, the club fell back to the Ligue du Sud-Est, and after four attempts, returned to the Championnat de France amateur in 1965. In the 1970s, Arles reached the second division of French football and, in its inaugural appearance in the 1970‚Äì71 season, finished 13th in its group. The club spent another three seasons in the league before falling to Division 3 in 1974. Arles returned to Division 2 in 1977, but after two seasons, were back in Division 3. In the 1980s, the club fell to Division 4. In 1992, under the tutelage of manager Jean-Louis Sanz, Arles earned promotion to the Championnat National and were inaugural members of the new league. The club played in the league for four seasons before earning promotion to the Championnat de France amateur 2. In 1999, Arles finished first in its group and were, subsequently, promoted to the Championnat de France amateur. The appearance in the fourth division was brief and, in 2002, Arles were back in the fifth division. In 2005, Arles embarked on a magical run, which concluded with the club earning promotion to Ligue 1. From 2005‚Äì2010, the club achieved promotions in four of the five football seasons. In 2005, the club finished third in its group in the CFA 2. However, because the club's that finished ahead of them were reserve teams of professional club, Arles were allowed ascension to the CFA. In the ensuing season, Arles won its group in the CFA and were promoted back to National. After finishing the 2007‚Äì08 season mid-table, Arles surprised many by finishing third in the league, thus going up to Ligue 2. Just after earning promotion to Ligue 2, Arles confirmed that the club was leaving the Stade Fernand Fournier to moved into the Parc des Sports in nearby Avignon, a bigger and more modern venue. The club, subsequently, changed its name to its current form and adopted a new crest. The club was initially not allowed to participate in Ligue 2 after the DNCG ruled the club ineligible due to irregularities in the club's financial accounts. However, following an appeal, the DNCG reversed its decision reinstating Arles' Ligue 2 status and also the club's professional status. In the club's return to the second division after over 35 years, Arles-Avignon against stunned French football enthusiasts by finishing third in the league. The club's final position was secured on the final day. Arles-Avignon was among four clubs battling for the final promotion spot and secured the position after a win over Clermont, who was one of the clubs fighting for the final spot. In the Arles-Avignon's debut in Ligue 1, the club struggled losing its first eight matches. The club's first point in the league came in its ninth attempt in a 0‚Äì0 draw in Brest. The following week, Arles-Avignon recorded a surprising 0‚Äì0 draw with Lyon and, two weeks later, earned the club's first Ligue 1 win; a 3‚Äì2 victory over Caen. On 10 July 2015, DNCG announced that Arles-Avignon was administratively relegated to Championnat de France Amateur from Ligue 2 for failing to guarantee sufficient capital. It was subsequently dissolved during the season.

His works and designs have become famous for bringing together the formal, technical tradition of Danish design into harmony with the American desire for innovation. Several of his designs for the Reed and Barton Company are still in production today.  Career  = Childhood = Sterling silver Reed & Barton coffee serviceJohn Prip was born in New York of a Danish father and an American mother. As a child, he moved to Denmark with his family, where his father ran a silversmithing factory that had been his grandfather's. At 15, Prip began an apprenticeship while attending high school. The next five years were spent polishing stakes, sweeping up, and laboriously reproducing classical renderings. The experience taught diligence and a deeply rooted technical skill, but simultaneously imposed a restricted aesthetic. In a way it was the unlearning of these traditional forms and procedures that pushed the young silversmith into bold experiments and motivated the innovations that distinguished his career. = Early career = In 1948, Prip returned to the United States with his wife, Karen, and infant son, Peter. He came over on the same boat with a woodworker named Tage Frid, who was to become a lifelong colleague and friend. They had both been invited to teach at a new school in Alfred, New York, called the School for American Craftsmen. At the time, there were few places to study and limited knowledge of metalsmithing techniques in the United States. Prip's position was unique: his Danish training provided him with firm technical grounding, while his American environment encouraged the attitude of exploration and innovation that became a hallmark of his career. = Mid-career = Silver flatware setWhen the school moved to the Rochester Institute of Technology two years later, Jack and his family, which now included daughter Janet, moved along with it. It was during this time in the early '50s that Prip and the crafts movement were eagerly searching for their own style. Along with Frans Wildenhain, Tage Frid, Ronald Pearson, and others, Prip established a gallery in Rochester called Shop One. This gallery was a unique institution in its time, providing not only a business venture originated and managed by craftsmen, but also a forum for the presentation of top quality avant-garde craftwork. Its mission was to educate the public to the special beauty of handmade objects. In 1957, after three years with Shop One, Prip again felt the need to move on. Through some fortunate connections he was hired by Reed and Barton Company, a holloware and flatware manufacturer in Massachusetts. The title invented for the role he conceived was Artist- Craftsman-Residence. He was given a workspace, materials, and access to the 900-worker factory. It was understood that Prip had a responsibility to address himself to work that might eventually profit the company, but beyond that guidance no restrictions were imposed. Prip was to stay at Reed and Barton for three years. One indication of his success there is the fact that 20 years later several of his designs are still in production. = Late career = Prip returned to teaching at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and after three years went to the Rhode Island School of Design, where he would teach until 1981.

In 1873 he acquired Kingswood Warren House and estate at Kingswood, Surrey which he extended and improved with the assistance of architect William Basset Smith. He had become party to an 1877 lawsuit relating to Enclosure but when in 1884 his lawyers became insolvent and absconded, his involvement caused his own bankruptcy, and the house and estate were sold in 1885. The house became the headquarters of the BBC Research Department in 1948.

He died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his uncle, Frederick, the seventh Baronet. *Sir Frederick Cradock-Hartopp, 7th Baronet (1869‚Äì1937). He died childless in 1937 and was succeeded by his younger brother, George, the eighth Baronet. *Sir George Francis Fleetwood Cradock-Hartopp, 8th Baronet (1870‚Äì1949). He was childless and on his death in 1949 the line of the fourth Baronet failed. The late Baronet was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, John, the ninth Baronet. *Sir John Edmund Cradock-Hartopp, 9th Baronet (1912‚Äì1996). He was the grandson of Edmund Charles Cradock-Hartopp, youngest son of the third Baronet. He died without male issue in 1996 and was succeeded by his first cousin, Kenneth, the tenth Baronet. *Sir Kenneth Alston Cradock-Hartopp, 10th Baronet (1918‚Äì2000).

Elliott State Park is a Pennsylvania state park located in Pine Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park is surrounded by Moshannon State Forest. The park is entirely wooded with second growth forests of hardwood and oak. S. B. Elliott State park is north of Clearfield on Pennsylvania Route 153 just off exit 111 of Interstate 80. History By the mid-19th century, the demand for lumber reached Clearfield County, where white pine and hemlock covered the mountainsides. Lumbermen came and harvested the trees. The Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company and Goodyear Lumber Company owned thousands of acres in Clearfield and surrounding counties. They built railroads and roads to harvest and distribute the timber. The lumber boom era was not to last, and soon all the trees were gone. Once the trees disappeared, the people were soon to follow. The lumbermen left behind a barren landscape that was devastated by erosion and wildfires. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought the thousands of acres of deforested and burned land. The state began the massive project of reforesting the land. The forest has since recovered and is part of Moshannon State Forest. The park is named for the Honorable Simon B. Elliott. He was a member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and a conservationist who promoted the idea of replanting the forests in order to limit erosion and fires. The park was built in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The young men of Camp S-116-PA built many of the cabins, roads, pavilions, and trails that exist at the park today. They also cleared brush, cleaned streams, built roads and bridges, and planted trees as part of a reforestation effort. The CCC also placed a plaque honoring Simon B. Elliott in the woods on the northern edge of the park. Cabin 1 is one of six CCC-built cabins in the park listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Recreation Fishing at S. B. Elliott State Park is a popular recreational activity. There is a population of native and stocked trout in the small mountain streams of the park. They can only be accessed by hiking through the woods on one of the three miles (5 km) of hiking trails. The park is a trailhead for the Quehanna Trail System. This trail is a trail that passes through Moshannon State Forest. It also connects with the Susquehannock Trail system near Sinnemahoning State Park. The CCC built several cabins and pavilions that are available for camping and picnicking. There is a 25 site rustic campground at S. B. Elliott State Park. There is a modern restroom near the camping area, but there are no showers. Hunting is permitted on about of S. B. Elliott State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania State Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and common pheasant. Many more acres of forested woodlands are available for hunting on the grounds of the adjacent Moshannon State Forest. Nearby state parks The following state parks are within of S. B.

Intended primarily for infantry, other Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS, ground Luftwaffe units and paratroopers were also eligible.  Eligibility The award was bestowed in three classes: *Bronze for 15 close combat actions; *Silver for 25 close combat actions; *Gold for 50 close combat actions. Close combat actions were counted from 1 December 1942, with earlier long service on the Eastern Front counting towards the award, with 15 continuous months counting as 15 combat days; 12 months as 10 days; and 8 months as 5 days. For those who had received disabling wounds, there was discretion to make the award after 10, 20 and 40 actions. As the war continued, a number of amendments were made to the award criteria: *From 4 August 1944, only front- line actions could count towards the clasp, with rear actions against partisans reflected in the award of the Bandit-warfare Badge. *From 30 August 1944, recipients of the gold clasp were normally also awarded the German Cross in gold; with silver clasp recipients receiving the Iron Cross first class, both without the need for further justification. *From 8 October 1944, those awarded the gold clasp also received 21 days special leave. The Gold Close Combat Clasp was often regarded in higher esteem than the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross by the German infantry, and Hitler reserved the right to bestow this class personally. Of the roughly 18‚Äì20 million soldiers of the German Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS, 36,400 received the Bronze Class, 9,500 the Silver Class and 631 the Gold Class. Design and wear The clasp was worn above the upper left uniform pocket, above any medal ribbon bar. Only one badge, the highest level received, was worn. It was die-cast and made of either tombac or later zinc. The design of all three classes was the same, with a centerpiece consisting of the eagle and swastika national emblem surmounting a crossed bayonet and hand grenade with, each side, a spray of oakleaves, interspersed with a sunburst ray effect. The clasp was slightly curved and measured 9.7cm by 2.6cm. 120px Nazi era awards were initially banned by the post-war Federal Republic of Germany. In 1957 many World War II military decorations, including the Close Combat Clasp, were re-authorised for wear by qualifying veterans. As display of the swastika was banned, the clasp was re-designed to remove the eagle and swastika symbol, with members of the Bundeswehr wearing the badge on the ribbon bar, represented by a small replica of the award on a field grey ribbon. Luftwaffe version Luftwaffe ground troops and paratroopers had been eligible for the Close Combat Clasp from its creation. In November 1944 a Luftwaffe version was approved, applying the same award criteria and three classes as the existing clasp. The badge comprised a laurel wreath set behind a Luftwaffe eagle and swastika surmounting a crossed bayonet and hand grenade, all in silver. This was flanked by two sprays of oak leaves, in bronze, silver or gold to denote the appropriate class. While awards of the new clasp were authorised, and award certificates issued, there is no evidence that it was actually manufactured and presented before the end of the war. The Luftwaffe Close Combat Clasp was among the decorations re-authorised for wear by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957, the modified design omitting the swastika, but retaining the Luftwaffe eagle emblem.

It combined for the first time full-screen, six-axis, flat- shaded 3D with 3D object interaction (like bouncing on a platform). Alpha Waves was an abstract game with a moody, artistic presentation, named for its supposed ability to stimulate the different emotional centers of the brain with its use of color and music. It was developed initially for the Atari ST by Christophe de Dinechin, and later ported to the Amiga and DOS. The DOS port was done by Fr√©d√©rick Raynal, a notable game designer who would go on to develop Alone in the Dark (often abbreviated AitD), and Little Big Adventure. He has said that his work on Alpha Waves was a major inspiration for the 3D engine for Alone in the Dark. The PC version was also localized in North America by Data East, and retitled Continuum. Infogrames may have also published their own version in the US under the original title, and it was also released as a part of no less than two Infogrames compilations, on which it retained its original name. In November 2012, Christophe de Dinechin released the complete assembly language and GFA BASIC development tools source code for the Atari ST version. There is also a started PC port in C++ on sourceforge by the original author. Mechanics Alpha Waves features two main modes of play: Action and Emotion. The core gameplay in both is the same. In emotion mode, players guide one of six crafts (which are little more than geometric shapes in many cases) onto trampoline-like platforms. On these platforms, the player bounces automatically, higher, with each jump, until he reaches the maximum height possible for that platform (some are stronger than others). Every room in the game is a cube, and the walls contain doorways leading to other rooms. In this way, players have to work their way through the game's rooms, and reach different areas based on different emotions. In Action Mode, players also work against the clock. Time bonuses are awarded for entering new rooms, and keys can be collected to open new paths. There is not a particular end to the game, but the goal is simply to last as long and to discover as much as possible before time runs out. Emotion Mode allows players to explore without time constraints, but players are not allowed to cross certain game boundaries. Emotion mode was not time limited, and allowed players to explore the game environment freely. While completing the game in Action Mode was very difficult, many players simply enjoyed exploring the game territory in Emotion Mode. Version differences Alpha Waves was initially released on the Atari ST. This version is notable for allowing two players to compete simultaneously. It lacked music entirely on the Atari 520ST, because of insufficient memory to store the music samples. On Atari 1040ST and later models, the theme song played during the intro. The music was stored on the second side of the floppy disk, since any Atari ST with enough memory also had a dual-sided floppy drive. A promotional version of the program was distributed by a French magazine on single-sided floppy disks, crashing any machine with more than 512K of memory. The Amiga port was second and added a theme song at the title screen. The interface is similar, but the zone select in Emotion has been redone. Beyond this, it is very similar to the original - including the retention of the split-screen two player mode. The MS-DOS version was the last one, and contains a number of improvements. This version supported AdLib/SoundBlaster sound cards. Despite the fact that these used the more limited FM synthesis of the Yamaha YM3812, compared to the PCM synthesis of the Amiga, Alpha Waves is one of the rare exceptions where the AdLib sound quality is superior. The soundtrack was also expanded to play in-game, and each zone had its own music. Additionally some of the mobiles have been changed, level layouts tweaked, and the camera tilting toned down for easier viewing. The menus and level selection screen have been redone again, and are noticeably enhanced. The DOS version also includes a two player Action Mode (turn-based as opposed to the split-screen of the other two versions). The DOS version lacks a mechanism to regulate speed when played on systems faster than it was intended for (essentially causing it to play in fast forward on newer hardware). However, when played on a properly configured system or emulator, this can be considered the superior version, for solo play especially. Technology Other 3D games of the same era include various ports of Elite (1984-1991), Falcon (1987), Driller (1987), Starglider 2 (1988), and Hovertank 3D (1991). Alpha-Waves (1990) brought a number of innovations to the 3D gaming experience that make it a significant landmark in 3D gaming: * Depth-of-field clipping (objects disappearing in the distance) * Large (for the time) number of 3D objects displayed simultaneously * First simultaneous two-player split- screen mode on a single computer (only on the Atari ST and Amiga versions) Alpha Waves ran on 16-bit microcomputers that did not have hardware floating- point capabilities. For that reason, it performed all perspective and rotation computations using only integer arithmetics. In order to avoid using integer multiplications, which were expensive at the time, it described objects using displacements that were multiples of a base vector. For instance, a square in the Z plane would have been described as \\"+1X +1Y -1X -1Y\\". As a result, the vast majority of geometric computations were performed using only additions, not multiplications. The computation of sine and cosines was similarly done using only integer arithmetic. All angles were represented using not degrees, but 1/256 of a circle. A lookup table contained the value of the sine multiplied by 32767. Multiplying this value by a 16-bit coordinate gave a 32-bit value, and the 16-bit high-half of that result was used. Another key to performance was a highly optimized polygon-filling routine, which used a number of tricks, including an assembly version of Duff's device to achieve a high fill rate, besting the in-house self-modifying routine Infogrames was using at the time. The Atari ST and Amiga versions were written in assembly language. The DOS version was written in C. Reception Computer Gaming World stated that the game \\"plays like one would expect a Star Trek: The Next Generation \\"holodeck\\" game to play\\". The magazine said that it offered \\"some fascinating game experiences\\", but the lack of combat or two-player modem racing‚Äîand goals so uninteresting that they \\"actually detract from the game\\"‚Äîcaused it to \\"fall short in the most important department of lasting entertainment\\". The One gave the DOS version of Alpha Waves an overall score of 80%, calling it the \\"most abstract and original\\" game of Infogrames' Crystal Collection, and begins their review by noting that \\"Alpha Waves' effect is so dependent on colour and sound that you really do need a fast VGA machine with an AdLib sound card to get the most out of it. However, even with all the suitable hardware Alpha Waves doesn't have much of a lasting appeal.\\" The One furthermore expresses that \\"It's quite an entertaining way to spend a few hours, but the problem is that as nice as the idea is there simply isn't enough variety to sustain interest. After a few weeks play the only state of mind that Alpha Waves will induce is boredom.\\" In regards to Alpha Waves proposed psychological aspect, The One states that \\"Whether the light and sound frequencies actually do have some effect is difficult to tell - certainly no-one here noticed any difference.\\" Despite these criticisms, The One praises Alpha Waves as \\"very original\\", and also praises its soundtrack as \\"simple but effective\\".

The initial Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid conflict culminated in the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, and was followed by a century of border confrontation. In 1639, Safavid Persia and Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Zuhab which recognized Iraq in Ottoman control, and decisively parted the Caucasus in two between the two empires. For most of it, the Zuhab treaty was a consolidation of the Peace of Amasya of about a century earlier. Until the 18th century, the struggle between the Safavid version of Shia Islam and the Ottoman Turkish version of Sunni Islam had continued to remain an important dimension of the combative relationships between the two major empires.John Calabrese. \\"Turkey and Iran: Limits of a Stable Relationship\\", British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 25, No. 1. (May, 1998), p. 76 In the early 18th century, Persian‚ÄìOttoman peace negotiations introduced a new concept of inter-Muslim relations whereby sovereign states could co-exist as autonomous parts of the Islamic world community.Ernest Tucker, \\"The Peace Negotiations of 1736: A conceptual turning point in Ottoman‚ÄìIranian relations\\", The Turkish Studies Association Bulletin, 20 (Spring 1996), pp. 16‚Äì37 Although the further relations were guided by the mutual fear of weakness and distrust, it wasn't until 1847 when Qajar Persia and Ottoman Empire reached a substantial peace Treaty of Erzurum, starting a century of peace, after centuries of rivalry.  Emergence of a rivalry: 16th century  = Role of religion = Islam played an especially important role in defining the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid relationship. Both the Safavids and Ottomans relied on ties to Islam to help justify their individual rules. However, Islamic law prevents war of Muslims against each other, unless a religious need arises to enforce a sacred law or to check transgressions against it. Thus, for one power to wage war against the other, he would have to justify the action religiously. Selim I, sultan of the Ottoman Empire in the early 1500s, looked for such justification. Religious scholars and officials in the Ottoman Empire quickly labeled Shah Ismail, and by extension his followers, a threat to Islam for the heretical teachings they represented. As a result, Selim I ordered the execution of any sympathizers of Shah Ismail both in Constantinople and throughout Ottoman lands.Hess, Andrew C.. 1973. ‚ÄúThe Ottoman Conquest of Egypt (1517) and the Beginning of the Sixteenth-century World War‚Äù.

The area of Mesopotamia, permanently lost to the Ottomans in 1639 is shaded. The severity with which Selim I addressed the Safavid Empire reflected the threat that he felt emerging within the Ottoman borders. In 1507, Shah Ismail raided Anatolia, revealing the beginnings of the threat that the newly emerging Safavid Empire represented. Uprisings in Anatolia by followers of the Shi‚Äôa sect in the Shahkulu Uprising in 1511 solidified Selim‚Äôs fear of internal rebellion. The uprisings and Shi‚Äôa culture retained influence from Shah Ismail and the Safavids. He embraced the same rhetoric used against the Safavids send military force to crush the rebellion. = Trade embargoes = The Ottomans used trade embargoes consistently against the Safavid Empire as a way to assert dominance over their Eastern rival. The decisive Ottoman victory over the Safavids at Chaldiran in 1514 led to Ottoman rule in Asia Minor.Labib, Subhi. 1979. ‚ÄúThe Era of Suleyman the Magnificent: Crisis of Orientation‚Äù. International Journal of Middle East Studies 10 (4). Cambridge University Press: 435‚Äì51. http://www.jstor.org/stable/162212. In conjunction with invasions of Safavid lands and the capture of Baghdad, Selim I began restricting trade routes for Safavid silk traders and arresting anyone who entered the Ottoman empire from the Safavid Empire. The restriction of trade and arrests of intellectuals associated with the Safavids were only reversed under the leadership of Suleiman the Magnificent.

The committee was led by Quark and Atex. At the time, typesetting and physically cut and pasting of images was still required to assemble many pages because the specialized composition, pagination, text formatting, and graphic design systems that produced the content could not operate together to produce integrated output. PIL was designed to allow electronic integration of content and layout, so that one system could print complete pages or layouts with all the typeset text and composed images that came from heterogeneous subsystems. PIL describes the layout, and allows the use of any combination of markup languages and image formats to encode the content. It enables any publishing workflow of either sequential or simultaneous layout and content creation. PIL was successfully used to integrate many publishing systems including systems from Agfa, Atex, Autologic, Information International, Inc., Quark, Inc., and Scitex. Many languages and formats now exist to describe content for the World Wide Web, and to define documents by their logical structure, so the same content can be reformatted for multiple purposes. However, PIL exists to describe precisely a graphical design and the placement of all content within it. It is useful for those who want to define a specific visual presentation rather than the sort of fluid layout that a web browser allows. It does not directly provide any logical structure of elements such as headings, citations, captions and so on. It defines a (theoretically infinite) hierarchy of canvases with coordinate systems, tags, frames, and content of any type. These can be used as needed to draw any type of document. The complete public domain distribution of PIL includes the language specification document (including a BNF specification, example files, a programmer's guide, and C-language source code for a parser and an output engine to produce PIL. The source code is highly portable to any platform that supports C, either in the ANSI C or earlier K&R; forms.

Biography  He was born in Palmanova. When he was still a boy, his family moved to Brescia, where he saw the works of Girolamo Romani and decided to become a painter. Later, his family moved again, to Venice, where he enrolled at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia and worked with Costantino Cedini.Brief biography from the Dizionario biografico degli Italiani - Volume 10 (1968) @ Treccani. While there, he became friends with the architect Gian Antonio Selva, and went with him to Ferrara in 1787 to help decorate the Palazzo Bottoni.Brief biography by Daniele D'Anza @ Arte Ricerca (blocked link) Shortly after, he was in Padua, working as a set designer for the Obizzi family and, in 1790, was commissioned to do decorations for the Castello del Catajo. Two years later, he did similar work at the Palazzo Maffetti-Manzoni, then moved to Treviso, where he did frescoes on the ceiling of the Church of Saint Andrew in Volpago del Montello, the oratory of the Villa Bragadin in Ceggia and secular decorations for several villas in and Breda di Piave. From 1798 to 1800, he collaborated with Selva on decorations at the Palazzo Dolfin Manin in Venice. Moving on to Trieste, he collaborated with Matteo Pertsch and the sculptor Antonio Bosa (1780‚Äì1845) to provide decorations for the and the stock exchange building. In 1811, he was in Zara, working at the Palazzo del Governatore. This was followed by decorative work (now lost) at the theaters in Vipacco and Gorizia. At this time, he began to take advantage of a growing market for paintings in the homes of well-to-do non-aristocrats and, working in conjunction with a local art dealer named Tosoni, produced a wide variety of landscapes, vedute and other genres to satisfy local tastes. His canvases were expensive, but also very large. In 1831, despite his successes in Trieste, he began wandering again, returning briefly to Brescia, then settling in Milan where he took some smaller commissions, but was not very successful and died poor.

Stratonovich and popularized by British physicist John Hubbard. It is used to convert a particle theory into its respective field theory by linearizing the density operator in the many-body interaction term of the Hamiltonian and introducing an auxiliary scalar field. It is defined via the integral identity Translation available: : \\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ - \\\\frac{a}{2} x^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi a}} \\\\; \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\exp \\\\left[ - \\\\frac{y^2}{2 a} - i x y \\\\right] \\\\, dy, where the real constant a > 0. The basic idea of the HS transformation is to reformulate a system of particles interacting through two-body potentials into a system of independent particles interacting with a fluctuating field. The procedure is widely used in polymer physics, classical particle physics, spin glass theory, and electronic structure theory. Calculation of resulting field theories The resulting field theories are well-suited for the application of effective approximation techniques, like the mean field approximation. A major difficulty arising in the simulation with such field theories is their highly oscillatory nature in case of strong interactions, which leads to the well-known numerical sign problem. The problem originates from the repulsive part of the interaction potential, which implicates the introduction of the complex factor via the HS transformation.

Since February 2016, he has served as an Associate Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, that state's highest court. He is a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (2005‚Äì2008). Between his service as United States Attorney and his appointment to the Court of Appeals, Garcia was a partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. He has also served as chairman of El Museo del Barrio. Garcia previously served as Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (2003‚Äì2005), Acting Commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (2002‚Äì2003), Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement (2001‚Äì2002), and an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York (1992‚Äì2001). For his work in a number of high-profile terrorism investigations and trials as Assistant U.S. Attorney, Garcia received two Attorney General's Awards for Exceptional Service (1994, 1997), the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service (2002), and the CIA's Agency Seal Medallion (2002). Early life Garcia was born in 1961 in the Woodhaven neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens and grew up in Valley Stream where he attended Valley Stream Central High School on Long Island. Originally intending to be a journalist, Garcia earned undergraduate and master's degrees in English literature from SUNY Binghamton and the College of William & Mary, respectively. Garcia eventually decided to study law and graduated as valedictorian of the Albany Law School of Union University in 1989. Career After law school, Garcia practiced corporate law for a year at the Wall Street law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel. He then served as a law clerk for Judge Judith Kaye of the New York Court of Appeals from 1990 to 1992. =Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York (1992‚Äì2001)= From 1992 to 2001, Garcia was a prosecutor with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In that role, he was intimately involved in a number of high-profile terrorism investigations and trials. Within months of joining the Office, Garcia was assigned to the trial team prosecuting four defendants for perpetrating the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. In the ensuing trial, the four defendants were convicted on all counts. For his work on that case, Garcia received the Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service, the highest reward presented by the U.S. Department of Justice. Garcia said the case \\"would define my career in Government service.\\" In 1995, Garcia went to Manila in the Philippines to direct the investigation and prosecution of the terrorist conspiracy led by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to bomb 12 U.S. airliners flying from Asia to the United States. In 1996, Yousef and two other defendants were convicted of all counts. For his work on that case, Garcia received his second Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service. Garcia was assigned as one of the lead prosecutors in the case against four al-Qaeda operatives standing trial in New York for perpetrating the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya, which killed more than 200 people. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all 302 counts for the four defendants. For his work on that case, Garcia received the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service and the CIA's Agency Seal Medallion for his efforts coordinating with the intelligence community. =Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement (2001‚Äì2002)= From August 2001 to November 2002, Garcia served as the Senate-confirmed Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement in the U.S. Department of Commerce. In that role, \\"he was the top federal enforcer of dual-use export control laws.\\" =Acting Commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (2002‚Äì2003)= Garcia served as Acting Commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) from December 2002 to February 2003. In that position, he led the transition of the agency into the Department of Homeland Security. =Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (2003‚Äì2005)= From March 2003 to 2005, Garcia served in the Department of Homeland Security as the Senate-confirmed Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the second largest investigative agency in the U.S. government following the FBI. On January 15, 2004, Garcia announced the government had busted a Belarus-based international child pornography ring, including the arrest of more than 30 people on federal charges relating to child pornography and money laundering. On March 19, 2005, Garcia announced a record $11 million civil immigration settlement with Walmart for its use of several hundred undocumented janitorial workers. Overlapping with this period, from 2003 to 2006, Garcia was also Vice President of the Americas for Interpol, the international police organization. While vice president, he served on Interpol's executive committee, the body charged with overseeing the budget and strategic direction of the agency. =U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (2005‚Äì2008)= Garcia served as the Senate- confirmed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from September 2005 to December 1, 2008.

Chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Ethics Committee of FIFA (2012‚Äì2014) On July 17, 2012, in the wake of announced anti-corruption reforms by Sepp Blatter, the president of the world association football governing body FIFA, the organization appointed Garcia as the chairman of the investigative chamber of FIFA Ethics Committee, while German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was appointed as the chairman of the Ethics Committee's adjudication chamber. In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to respectively award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup to Russia and Qatar by the FIFA Executive Committee. Garcia delivered his consequent 350-page report in September 2014, and Eckert subsequently announced that it would not be made public for legal reasons. On November 13, 2014, Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Garcia's report. The summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups. FIFA welcomed \\"the fact that a degree of closure has been reached,\\" while the Associated Press wrote that the Eckert summary \\"was denounced by critics as a whitewash.\\" Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being \\"materially incomplete\\" with \\"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions,\\" while declaring his intention to appeal to FIFA's Appeal Committee. On December 16, 2014, FIFA's Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia's appeal against the Eckert summary as \\"not admissible.\\" FIFA also stated that Eckert's summary was \\"neither legally binding nor appealable.\\" A day later, Garcia resigned from his role as FIFA ethics investigator in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \\"lack of leadership\\" and lost confidence in the independence of Eckert from FIFA.

Their goal was to provide basic military training to all male students eligible of army service. Mandatory military training at the universities was mandated on August 8, 1951, military departments were mandated on October 1, 1951 and set up within few years at every university. Typically, for 4 years (later 2 years) one day in a week was dedicated to military training. Two military exercises (one month during the summer each) were held after 2nd and 4th year. After successful exams the students obtained minor military officer rank (', typically platoon leader) and their future mandatory military service was reduced to one year (the others served for two years). Exempted were those who took the military service prior the study, those unfit for the service for health reason and women. The departments were subordinated to the university rectors and to the Ministry of Defense for military specific tasks. They were manned by army officers, sometimes as a punishment for drinking or incompetence, sometimes by those near retirement. The institution was universally loathed by the students. During the student strike in November‚ÄìDecember 1989 (part of Velvet Revolution events) the military training stopped and it was largely ignored by students afterwards. In March 1990 the length of mandatory military service was reduced to 18 months (in July 1993 again to 12 months) and alternative civil service was established. The parliament discussed abolishing the departments during March 1990. All departments were officially liquidated on September 30, 1990.

Davidson was best known for his pioneering work on the role of gene regulation in evolution, on embryonic specification and for spearheading the effort to sequence the genome of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. He devoted a large part of his professional career to developing an understanding of embryogenesis at the genetic level. He wrote many academic works describing his work, including a textbook on early animal development. Early career Davidson began conducting research as a teenager at The Marine Biological Laboratory. After graduating from high school, he matriculated to the University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a B.A. in biology in 1958. Davidson's Ph.D. work entailed studying RNA synthesis and gene expression in early development of the anuran Xenopus laevis in the lab of Alfred Mirsky at Rockefeller University. From Rockefeller to Caltech After obtaining his Ph.D., Davidson stayed on at Rockefeller first as a research associate and then as an assistant professor. In 1971, he moved to the California Institute of Technology as an associate professor. There, Davidson took an interest in development of marine invertebrates, especially of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and in investigating the function of genomic repetitive DNA elements, both interests of which would lead to a long line of investigation that eventually led to his contemporary interest in gene regulatory networks. Career in biology Davidson has spent the majority of his scientific career investigating the molecular and mechanistic basis of animal development, i.e. how animals are built by reading the instructions encoded in the egg and, ultimately, in the genome. While at Rockefeller and very early in his career, he and Roy Britten, then at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, speculated on how the products of transcription, e.g. various RNAs or other downstream products, would need to in principle interact in order for cellular differentiation and gene regulation to occur in multicellular organisms. This research program eventually led him to investigations regarding the role of gene regulation in cell lineage and embryonic territory specification, both endeavors of which contributed substantially to many biological disciplines, including developmental biology, systems biology and evolutionary developmental biology. In 2011, he was awarded the International Prize for Biology in recognition for his pioneering work on developmental gene regulatory networks. Shortly before his death from a heart attack in 2015, Davidson co-authored a landmark review book providing a grand synthesis of the theory and experimental evidence relating to the design and function of genomic regulatory networks within the animal taxonomic clade of Bilateria.  Interest in American Folk Music  In the 1950s and 1960s Davidson traveled throughout Grayson and Caroll counties in Virginia recording traditional folk music .

H. Bruce Lockhart, in Malaya, 1909 The Bruce Lockhart family is of Scottish origins, and several members have played rugby football for Scotland, but since the early 20th century most have lived and worked in England or Canada, or else overseas, in India, Malaya, Australia, Russia, Rhodesia, Fiji, and elsewhere. Origins Sir George Bruce, a 16th-century ancestor of the Bruce Lockharts, in Culross Abbey The first of the family to combine the two names was the schoolmaster Robert Bruce Lockhart (1858‚Äî1950), born at Montreal in Upper Canada and a graduate of the University of Edinburgh, who was the son of Robert Arthur Lockhart (1832‚Äì1904) and Annabella Wilson (1833‚Äì1888), both of whom had been born in Glasgow and died in Edinburgh.Sir Robert Hamilton Bruce Lockhart, The Diaries of Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart, Volume 1 (Macmillan, 1973), p. 9\\"Robert Bruce Lockhart M.A. 1878\\" (obituary) in University of Edinburgh Journal, Volumes 15-16 (1951), p. 107: \\"ROBERT BRUCE LOCKHART, M.A. 1878, late headmaster of Eagle House, Sandhurst, previously of Waid Academy, Anstruther, Spiers School, Beith, and Seafield House, Broughty Ferry : in London, 18th November 1950, aged 91.\\" His mother was a daughter of William Wilson and Annabella Bruce (1807‚Äì1884) herself a daughter of James Hamilton Bruce (1783‚Äì1823), who was a great-great-grandson of Alexander Bruce, 2nd Earl of Kincardine. He was descended from Thomas Bruce, 1st Baron of Clackmannan, as are most Bruces, including the Chiefs of Clan Bruce. Thomas Bruce is known to have been related to Robert the Bruce (1274‚Äì1329), king of Scotland, but how is not clear.Jamie Bruce Lockhart & Alan Macfarlane, Dragon Days (2013) (full text online at cam.ac.uk), p. 11Sir Robert Douglas, The Peerage of Scotland: containing an historical and genealogical account of the Nobility of that Kingdom, (Edinburgh: R. Fleming, 1764), p. 294 Alexander Bruce (1629‚Äì1680), another ancestor Lockhart was headmaster of several schools: first the Waid Academy, at Anstruther, then Spier's School, Beith, a new school. In 1895 he founded Seafield House Preparatory School at Broughty Ferry, and in 1906 bought Eagle House School, at Sandhurst, Berkshire. For Lockhart, the name Bruce was a middle Christian name, celebrating distinguished ancestors,When he died in 1949, probate on his estate was granted to \\"LOCKHART, Robert Bruce\\": from Probate Index for 1950 at probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar, accessed 12 April 2018 and most of his sons also had it as a middle name, their surname as registered at the General Register Office remaining simply Lockhart. However, by the use of the name by almost all the men of the family, and later by all its daughters, too, the name Bruce has come to be regarded as part of the surname, in some cases leading to the adoption of a hyphen. Family character In his book Dragon Days (2013), James Bruce Lockhart sums up the family character when he arrived at the Dragon School in 1949: \\"The Bruce Lockhart family were schoolmasters, imperial soldiers, and diplomats, they taught, directed, and administered; and they played games in their spare time; muscular Christianity was their thing.\\"Lockhart & Macfarlane, Dragon Days (2013), p. 9 Family members Robert Bruce Lockhart married Florence Stewart McGregor (1864‚Äì1928), who had been born in Riverton, New Zealand.

The Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, an executive agency of DEFRA, has its central laboratories in a semi-rural part of New Haw. The laboratory is notable as being one of the principal test centres for the H5N1 virus. Geography It adjoins Byfleet, Weybridge, Addlestone, Ottershaw and Rowhill/Row Town, West Byfleet and Woodham. New Haw stands on an irregular south-west border close to Woking, the River Wey, the start of the Basingstoke Canal, and the (River Bourne, Addlestone Branch). The Wey Navigation rises through three steep locks in the relatively short New Haw section. History \\"Haw\\" is an old word for \\"lock gate\\", and it is possible that New Haw developed following the installation of the \\"new\\" lock gate in 1653, near The White Hart pub.The Grade II Listed New Haw lock-keeper's cottage (pictured) dates from 1782 but was heavily rebuilt with steel strengthening beams added above the ground floor windows after a gas explosion and fire in 1982. It appeared as Mr. Bedford's \\"Cherry Cottage\\" in the 1964 science-fiction film First Men in the Moon, based loosely on the H.G. Wells novel of the same title published in 1901. There is a little evidence of New Haw's history. The original village was a hamlet of Woking, around Crockford Park farm, bordering Addlestone. Several aeroplanes are believed to have crashed in New Haw during the early decades of the 20th century. On 25 May 1912, an Avro Type F cabin monoplane landed upside down on nearby Addlestone Moor. Photographic evidence of this accident is held by Brooklands Museum. The village centre lies around the junction of Woodham Lane and the Scotland Bridge Road roundabout and on the northwest side of the latter, until recently, a well-established motor vehicle sales business occupied an original 1930s garage, petrol station and workshop known for many years as \\"Woodham Motors\\". Although the front of the premises have been somewhat altered in recent years, the pre-war brick-built central two-story clock tower with large two-bay workshop behind survive in good condition and make an interesting local landmark. With the commuter boom of the 1950/60s, New Haw expanded further southwest down Woodham Lane towards West Byfleet and Woodham and a popular shopping area for local residents is The Broadway, where a number of shops, public houses and restaurants are located. Churches In 1873 All Saints School was founded as a school for Poor Persons, probably with a grant from John Marshall-Paine, who had previously lived at Sayes Court, Addlestone. The school opened in 1874 and included accommodation for 92 pupils. School records show that there were frequent absences during harvesting or at other times when help was needed on the farms. Conditions at the school were far from ideal. The schoolroom was often in need of repair, and during the winter of 1906 temperatures plummeted to 1 ¬∞C (35 degrees Fahrenheit), and at one time the teacher of the infants was herself only 11 years old. In 1911 the school became All Saints' Church. It is part of the diocese of Guildford.All Saints Church Information All Saints' New Haw has a thriving congregation including a range of youth activities and a full programme of events for all ages. In 2009 Bosco's and Claire's Cafe were added to the church buildings. Amenities The village has a number of open spaces. The largest is Heathervale Park, a green space bordering the Basingstoke canal. Fullbrook School offers local residents athletic facilities, including a gym, football pitches, and tennis courts. There are a number of public houses throughout the area: the Black Prince (dating from 1937 and still largely unaltered externally) on Woodham Lane and Scotland Bridge Road roundabout, the Station (was the Claremont, then the Catherine of Aragon) next to West Byfleet railway station, and The White Hart adjacent to the Wey Navigation on New Haw Road roundabout with Woodham Lane and Byfleet Road. Education Local schools include: New Haw Junior School, Fullbrook School, the Grange Community Infant School, and the Grove nursery.The Grange Community Infant School ofsted report Transport The M25 motorway passes, without junctions for more than 3 miles, through the west of the village. The main north-south road, the A318 road in New Haw is one of few A-roads in the South East to have narrow sections for HGVs at the bridge crossing the Wey Navigation and with a sharp bend on the turn-off for Woodham. The route also has fixed and mobile speed cameras. The village's railway stations are West Byfleet and Byfleet and New Haw, which was originally called West Weybridge. These stations are on the slow Waterloo to Woking service, but West Byfleet station has access to several quicker services. Numerous bus services run through the village, most run by Travel Surrey, who also have their depot in the area. References External links * All Saint's Church webpage.

Proponents of the practice assert that lying is the primary source of modern human stress, and speaking bluntly and directly, even about painful or taboo subjects, will make people happier by creating an intimacy not possible while hiding things. Blanton's Radical Honesty technique includes having practitioners state their feelings bluntly, directly and in ways typically considered impolite.

From the website bio of the character in the first season: ‚ÄúEli Loker is Lightman's lead researcher, who is so uncomfortable with the human tendency to lie that he's decided to practice what he calls \\"radical honesty.\\" He says everything on his mind at all times and often pays the price.‚Äù In the Divergent series, the Candor faction is dedicated to practicing Radical Honesty. Writer A.J. Jacobs devotes a chapter in the book The Guinea Pig Diaries to his attempts to live according to the precepts of Radical Honesty. Author Brandon Mendelson is known as a practitioner of a modified form of Radical Honesty. At a Moth Mainstage event in 2009, radio producer and writer Starlee Kine related her experience with Radical Honesty, which she labelled a cult. Kine described a seminar where Blanton was verbally abusive and at one point urged her to sign a contract to obey him completely for the duration of the seminar. In the last book of the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld, a character named Frizz Mizuno invented a surgical brain procedure called \\"Radical Honesty\\" that renders him unable to lie. In fact, if he hears someone tell a lie when he himself knows the truth, he can't even simply not speak‚Äîhe has to reveal the truth under any circumstances. Even at the possible cost of his own life and the lives of people he cares about, he still can't lie to save them, because his brain is wired to speak the truth.Extras, Scott Westerfeld In Bones (season 6), episode 20, The Pinocchio in the Planter, the victim, Ross Dickson, was part of a fictional group called \\"The Honesty Policy\\" that practiced Radical Honesty. The episode begins exploring radical honesty as the victim being deliberately rude and belligerent, with ill effects potentially leading to his demise, and with a crass and alienating character who attended the same group. However, it also explores through several character sub-plots positive outcomes resulting from honesty inspired by encountering the concept of Radical Honesty. The phrase \\"Radical Honesty\\" is used throughout the episode. In Silicon Valley (season 5), episode 3, Chief Operating Officer, a character called Ben Burkhardt played by Benjamin Koldyke follows a leadership philosophy developed by Kim Scott called \\"Radical Candor\\" or as he calls \\"RadCan\\" which bears many of the hallmarks of a warped version of Radical Honesty. e.g., for comedy purposes, he is 'honest about lying' and withholding information from other characters when speaking with third parties. Thereby drawing those third parties into his 'honest' (at least to the third party) lies.

It is uncertain whether this game dates back to the pre-Columbian Maya civilization, or whether it developed in the post-colonial era after the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores.  Descriptions of the game  Stewart Culin described the game in the 24th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology: Games of North American Indians published in 1907.Culin, Stewart (1907). 24th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology: Games of North American Indians. Washington DC: US gov Printing Office. 846 pp. (rev. ed. 1975 ) Dover Publications. 867 pp. . (1994) University of Nebraska Press. R. C. Bell referred to the game in Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations. Both of these descriptions were based on the eyewitness accounts of others. Lieve Verbeeck, a linguist studying Mayan language, witnessed the modern version of the game being played by Mopan and Kekchi Maya in Belize: > But neither can I give you hard evidence that the corn game, as it is now > still played by the Mopan and K'ekchi' Mayans, (who are neighbours), was > known in the ancient times.

I observed the game being played by 10 men. They placed 25 grains > of corns in a row. The game lasted for 3 hours, because they played 5 > variants.  History  It is not known exactly when the game was developed or what the original rules were as very few records survived the invasion by the conquistadors between the 15th and 17th centuries. Stewart Culin organised the games in his anthology into those he thought had an influence from Europe in their creation. Bul is not listed among these, and in his opinion the game must have developed before Europeans arrived in Central America.  Rules for two players  There are a variety of ways to play the game, as Verbeeck's account shows. The game could be played by two people, or by two equal-sized teams. The overall objective is to capture and subsequently kill the playing pieces of the opposition, so the game is in essence a war game. The playing area is divided into equal spaces using rods placed parallel to each other. The two players have control of a base at either end of the play area. The players take an even number of stones or figurines (or any suitable playing piece) and place them in their respective bases. The movement of the stones is determined by the roll of four dice or bul (corn kernels). These are marked black on one side (typically with charcoal) so that they land showing either a yellow or black face. The number of marked faces showing determines how many spaces a stone can move: * 1 black ‚Äì 1 space * 2 black ‚Äì 2 spaces * 3 black ‚Äì 3 spaces * 4 black ‚Äì 4 spaces * 0 black (all yellow) ‚Äì 5 spaces Alternating turns, players roll the bul and move any of their stones the corresponding number of spaces toward the enemy base. A stone cannot move to a space already occupied by a friendly stone. If there is no other option but to do this, a player must pass. When a stone lands on the same space as an enemy stone, the enemy stone is captured and is no longer controlled by the enemy player. The enemy stone is placed beneath the capturing stone to reflect its captured state. Every time the capturing stone moves, its prisoners are moved with it. If a stone lands on an enemy stone that already has prisoners, it captures that stone and its prisoners, and these are placed beneath it. When a stone captures an enemy stone, it immediately reverses direction and begins heading back to the home base. Once a stone and its prisoners reach home, any enemy stones are removed from the game, or killed. Friendly stones are liberated or returned to the set of stones that can be played. A player wins once they kill every enemy stone.  Rules for teams  Only two teams can play, and these must be of equal size. Five or six players per team is a common team size. Seven players per team was the maximum and two per team was the minimum. The game is played with one stone for each team member. Players on a team rotate who rolls the bul and moves a stone.  Variants  The number of stones used by each player can be changed for a shorter or longer game as necessary. Players can also agree before the game that only a certain number of stones can leave the base and be in play at any one time (an example being that players can only have two stones in play outside of the base). The game length can be changed by having less spaces between the two bases. Verbeeck mentioned twenty-five dividing rods being used, but a much shorter game would be played using only nine or ten rods.

As the standards organization under ISO responsible for the development of all international financial services standards, ISO/TC 68 plays a key role in the development and adoption of new technologies in the banking, brokerage and insurance industries. Many of its current work projects involve developing ecommerce standards such as better online security for financial transactions, XML standards for financial transactions and standards to reduce the cost and delays of international financial transactions. The membership of ISO/TC 68, consists of more than 30 organizations assigned by participating national standards bodies plus additional international standards development organizations that work collaboratively toward global financial services standards development. Technical Subcommittees of ISO/TC 68 Within TC 68 there are, at present, three technical subcommittees, or SC's: ISO/TC 68/SC 2 (Financial Services, security), ISO/TC 68/SC 8 (Reference data for financial services), and ISO/TC 68/SC 9 (Information exchange for financial services).https://www.iso.org/committee/49650.html Subcommittees prepare and manage international standards within specific areas of concentration. Subcommittees review existing standards once every five years to update them. New standards are developed by subcommittees under the New Work Item process. Standards Development Process New Work Items are proposed by three or more countries that are members of ISO/TC 68. If a New Work Item is approved by a super majority of countries that are members of ISO/TC 68 the New Work Item is assigned to a Working Group under a Technical Subcommittee. Each Working Group consists of technical experts in the field appointed to represent their member countries. After a sequence of revisions to committee drafts, proposed standards developed by a Working Group must be approved by a super majority of countries that are members of ISO/TC 68 before being submitted to ISO for approval as an ISO standard. =National Role= Where appropriate, national standards setting bodies can propose existing national standards to ISO/TC 68 to become adopted as international standards with the approval of ISO/TC 68 and ISO. These standards must be submitted as New Work Items by three or more member countries of ISO/TC 68. =History of ISO/TC 68= In the late 1940s, members of the financial industry came together under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to begin developing technical standards for the banking industry to use on a world-wide basis. The original name of the organization working on banking standards was Technical Committee 68, or TC 68-Banking. Over time the scope of TC 68 expanded to include all financial services. TC 68 has continued its basic mission through industry changes and the adoption of new scientific technologies that have fostered greatly increased international commerce. One of the changes made to reflect changes to the financial industry is TC 68's name. It is now referred to as Technical Committee 68 on Banking, Securities and other Financial Services. =TC 68 Secretariat= ANSI ASC X9 holds a unique position within this ISO framework. It is the Secretariat to TC 68 and is also the leader of the official United States Technical Advisory Group (TAG) which represents the U.S. financial services industry to the international technical committee.

Biography  Albert Gallo was born on June 6, 1930, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. His parents were Albert (Umberto) and Mary Gallo (nee Nunziata). His two older brothers were Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Gallo and Joe \\"Crazy Joey\\" Gallo. A bootlegger during Prohibition, Albert Sr. did not discourage his three sons from becoming criminals. Albert Gallo joined his brothers Larry and Joey in a gang that controlled President street South Brooklyn. At one point, Albert Gallo lived in the Greenwood section of Brooklyn. In the late 1970s, Gallo told the media that he owned a furniture company. It is unknown if Gallo is married or has a family. = Profaci crime family = The three Gallo brothers became affiliated with capo Harry Fontana's crew in the Profaci crime family, then headed by boss Joseph Profaci. In 1957, Profaci allegedly asked Joe Gallo and his crew to murder Albert Anastasia, the boss of the Gambino crime family. On October 25, 1957, Anastasia was murdered by two disguised men in the barber shop of a Manhattan hotel. It is unknown if Albert Gallo participated in the Anastasia killing. Some say it was Colombo mobster Carmine Persico, who participated in the shooting of Anastasia. Eventually, Larry and Joey both became inducted members of the Profaci family. However, Albert never achieved this status in the family. Although Joey was the most explosive and strong-willed of the brothers, Larry was the organized thoughtful one who actually ran the crew. Younger brother Albert tended to stay in the background. By the end of the 1950s, the Gallo brothers had become very dissatisfied with Profaci's leadership. Profaci was maintaining a lavish lifestyle by severely taxing everyone else in his crime family. In 1959, Profaci ordered the Gallos to murder fellow crew member Frank Abbatemarco, who ran lucrative bookmaking and loan sharking operations. Abbatemarco owed Profaci $50,000 in unpaid tribute and refused to pay it out of protest. On November 4, 1959, Abbatemarco was shot inside a tavern in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn. Some accounts state that Albert, his brothers and Joseph \\"Joe Jelly\\" Gioelli killed Abbatemarco. Other reports say that Joey Gallo refused the assignment on behalf of the crew. After Abbatemarco's murder, Profaci took his rackets, leaving nothing for the Gallo crew. = First Colombo War = Albert and the Gallo crew now turned against Profaci. In February 1961, the Gallos kidnapped underboss Joseph Magliocco and capos Frank Profaci, John Scimone and Joseph Colombo. Profaci was a target also, but he managed to escape capture. To obtain their release, Profaci negotiated an agreement with the Gallos. However, after the hostage were released, Profaci reneged on the agreement and went after the Gallo crew. On August 20, 1961, Scimone, now a Profaci loyalist, lured Larry Gallo into meeting him at a lounge, where several men, including Persico, tried to kill him. This was the start of the First Colombo War. On December 21, 1961, Joey Gallo was sentenced seven to fourteen years in prison, but the conflict continued. In June 1962, Profaci died of cancer and the family leadership passed to Magliocco. On January 29, 1962, Albert Gallo and six other crew members rescued six small children from an apartment filled with smoke by a mattress fire. None of the children or mobsters were injured. In 1963, with the conviction of two more Gallo crew members, both sides accepted a peace agreement brokered by Patriarca crime family boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca. The first war was over, with the Profaci crime family becoming the Colombo crime family. = Peacetime = On January 8, 1965, Albert and Larry Gallo, along with 13 other crew members, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and were sentenced to six months in prison. In 1966, New York City's Youth Board requested that Albert Gallo and his brothers help them lower racial tensions between white and African-American youths in the East New York and Flatbush sections of Brooklyn. At one meeting with white youths, Albert Gallo sent a teenager sprawling for using a racial epithet. Brooklyn District Attorney Aaron Koota protested the use of the Gallo brothers, but New York Mayor John V. Lindsay defended the Youth Board's actions. On October 24, 1967, Albert Gallo was indicted on charges related to a ticket cashing racket at Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury, New York. In May 1968, Larry Gallo died of cancer. Joe Gallo took control of the Gallo crew from prison. = Second Colombo War = In 1971, Joe Gallo was released from prison. Later that year, boss Joseph Colombo was shot and paralyzed. Former Gallo crew member Carmine Persico now took control of the family through a series of front bosses. Convinced that the Gallos had tried to kill Colombo, the Colombo leadership went after Joey Gallo. On April 7, 1972, gunmen murdered Joey Gallo in Umberto's Clam House in Manhattan's Little Italy, starting the Second Colombo War. John \\"Mooney\\" Cutrone, a made man and close confidant of both Larry and Joey, was seen as Joey's logical successor. However, to maintain harmony in the crew, Cutrone supported Albert for capo. The untested and less experienced Albert now became boss of the Gallo crew. In August 1972, Albert Gallo learned that several members of the Colombo leadership, including Alphonse Persico (Carmine Persico's brother) and Gennaro Langella would be meeting at the Neapolitan Noodle restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The Gallo crew hired a hitman from Las Vegas to ambush and murder the Colombo leaders. However, at the restaurant, the confused hitman shot four innocent meat wholesalers instead of the mobsters. Two of his victims died. In the following months, an uneasy truce prevailed between the Colombos and the Gallos. = Cutrone defection = In 1974, the truce was shattered when Cutrone and his followers defected back to the Colombo family. Cutrone, Gerry Basciano, Sammy Zahralbam, and other Gallo members had become dissatisfied with their lack of income under Albert's leadership. Almost immediately, violence broke out between the Gallo and Cutrone factions. Gallo loyalist James Geritano wiretapped Basciano's phone, allowing them to plan an ambush. On July 1, 1974, Basciano and Zahralbam were shot and wounded on a Brooklyn sidewalk, but escaped serious injury. On August 1974, the Cutrone faction shot and killed Gallo loyalist Stevie Cirillo while he was playing craps at a charity benefit in a Brooklyn synagogue. On September 11, 1974, a sniper shot and seriously wounded Gallo loyalist Frank \\"Punchy\\" Illiano, Albert's lieutenant, near the Gallo headquarters on President street. = Leaving the Colombo crime family = In the autumn of 1974, the Mafia Commission intervened in the Gallo/Cutrone conflict. The family bosses believed that the violence was interfering with business and bringing public attention to their activities. The Commission negotiated an agreement under which Albert and his followers would join the crew of Vincent Gigante, then a powerful capo in the Genovese Family. Cutrone and his rebels would remain with the Colombo Family. Losing members, running out of money and virtually besieged in their President Street headquarters, the Gallo crew had no other choice. The Second Colombo War was over. In February 1976, the peace agreement was violated when a sniper fired two gunshots into the Gallo headquarters, slightly wounding crew member Steven Boriello. Now part of Genovese family, Albert immediately filed a formal protest to the Colombo leadership. The Colombo bosses responded by summoning Cutrone and Basciano to a \\"sitdown\\" to explain their actions. Neither man attended the meeting; they also ignored attempts by the Colombo leadership. At this point, the mob families lost patience with Cutrone and Basciano. On June 16, 1976, a gunman shot and killed Basciano while he was eating at a luncheonette. Cutrone went into hiding, but the Colombos convinced him that Basciano's death ended the problem. On October 5, 1976, a gunman shot and killed Cutrone while he was eating breakfast at a diner. Revealingly, the Colombo family did not show any signs of displeasure at the killing of Cutrone, a made man. = Genovese crime family = With all threats now extinguished, Gallo peacefully rose through the ranks of the Genovese family, most likely being officially inducted into the New York Mafia in 1976, when the books were open once again after roughly 20 years. Gallo is still listed as an acting captain. He is, however, retired, remaining a highly respected elder statesman.  References   Further reading  * Raab, Selwyn.

When it burned, the American Institute Fair was being held there. The fire began in a lumber room on the side adjacent to 42nd Street. Within fifteen minutes its dome fell and in twenty-five minutes the entire structure had burned to the ground. No lives were lost but the loss of property amounted to more than $350,000. This included the building, valued at $125,000, and exhibits and valuable statuary remaining from the World's Fair.New York Times, Other Burned Theatres, December 7, 1876, Page 10.

The Tale, like most monogatari, exists in three main forms: written, oral, and painted. The original text is sometimes attributed to Hamuro Tokinaga, and is written in 36 chapters. As is the case with most other monogatari, the text has been rewritten and revised many times over the years, and developed into an oral tradition as well. Most often, the Tale of Heiji would be chanted as a continuation of the Tale of H≈çgen, which relates the events of the closely related H≈çgen Rebellion.In the name \\"Tale of \\"H≈çgen,\\" the \\"H≈çgen\\" refers to the Japanese era name after \\"Ky≈´ju\\" and before \\"Heiji,\\" which was a time period spanning the years from 1156 through 1159. The picture scroll version of the tale, called Heiji monogatari emaki or Heiji monogatari ekotoba, dates to the 13th century. It tells the tale in color on paper, on five scrolls. Each scroll begins and ends with a written portion of the tale, describing the events depicted in a single continuous painting across the length of the scroll. Perhaps the most famous scene of these five scrolls is the Night Attack on the Sanj≈ç Palace. The emaki scrolls are now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. Rivalries The Tale of Heiji presents a conflict between old aristocratic and new military elites. The Heiji story moves beyond from the comparatively simple narration template of the H≈çgen monogatari towards a more complicated focus which suggests a need for more nuanced principles and more flexible policies which become more appropriate to desperate times.Brown et al. (1979). Gukansh≈ç, p. 392. As in the H≈çgen story, multi-level and inter-related rivalries lead to war; and the main characters are presented in traditional status order: Emperors and former Emperors first, Fujiwara ministers second, and military clan warriors third.Brown et al.

As in the H≈çgen story, the narrative structure is divided in three distinct segments: * Part 1 introduces origins of the conflicts. * Part 2 retells the course of events. * Part 3 enumerates the tragic consequences. Monogatari historiography The Japanese have developed a number of complementary strategies for capturing, preserving and disseminating the essential elements of their commonly accepted national history ‚Äì chronicles of sovereigns and events, biographies of eminent persons and personalities, and the military tale or gunki monogatari. This last form evolved from an interest in recording the activities of military conflicts in the late 12th century. The major battles, the small skirmishes and the individual contests‚Äîand the military figures who animate these accounts‚Äîhave all been passed from generation to generation in the narrative formats of the H≈çgen monogatari (1156), the Heiji monagatari (1159‚Äì1160), and the Heike monogatari (1180‚Äì1185). In each of these familiar monogatari, the central figures are popularly well known, the major events are generally understood, and the stakes as they were understood at the time are conventionally accepted as elements in the foundation of Japanese culture. The accuracy of each of these historical records has become a compelling subject for further study; and some accounts have been shown to withstand close scrutiny, while other presumed ‚Äúfacts‚Äù have turned out to be inaccurate.Brown, p. 385-386.

The control over European minorities began to collapse after 1800, with Greece was the first to break free, followed by Serbia. Egypt was lost in 1798‚Äì1805. In the early 20th century Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bulgarian Declaration of Independence soon followed. The Ottomans lost nearly all their European territory in the First Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913). The Ottoman Empire allied itself with Germany in the First World War, and lost. The British successfully mobilized Arab nationalism. The Ottoman Empire thereby lost its Arab possessions, and itself soon collapsed in the early 1920s.

The Reis Efendi, or Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Ottoman Empire. 1809  Structure  The Ottoman Empire's diplomatic structure was unconventional and departed in many ways from its European counterparts. Traditionally, foreign affairs were conducted by the Reis √ºl-K√ºttab (Chief Clerk or Secretary of State) who also had other duties. In 1836, a Foreign Ministry was created.See Foundations of the Ottoman Foreign Ministry International Journal of Middle East Studies, 1974 =Finance= After 1600 wars were increasingly expensive and the Empire never had an efficient system of taxation.Eliana Balla and Noel D.

The Porte relied on loans from merchants and tax farming, whereby local; elites collected taxes (and kept their share). The winner in a war acquired new territory‚Äîthe local leadership usually stayed the same, only they now collected taxes for the winning government. The war's loser often paid cash reparations to the winner, who thereby recouped the cost of the war.Sevket Pamuk, \\"The evolution of financial institutions in the Ottoman Empire, 1600‚Äì1914.\\" Financial History Review 11.1 (2004): 7‚Äì32. online. = Ambassadors = Ambassadors from the Ottoman Empire were usually appointed on a temporary and limited basis, as opposed to the resident ambassadors sent by other European nations.Watson, 218. The Ottomans sent 145 temporary envoys to Venice between 1384 and 1600.Yurdusev et al., Ottoman Diplomacy p. 27. The first resident Ottoman ambassador was not seen until Yusuf Agah Efendi was sent to London in 1793.Yurdusev et al., 2.Yurdusev et al., 30. Ambassadors to the Ottoman Empire began arriving shortly after the fall of Constantinople. The first was Bartelemi Marcello from Venice in 1454. The French ambassador Jean de La For√™t later arrived in 1535.Yurdusev et al., 39. In 1583, the ambassadors from Venice and France would attempt unsuccessfully to block William Harborne of England from taking up residence in Istanbul. This move was repeated by Venice, France and England in trying to block Dutch ambassador Cornelius Haga in 1612.Yurdusev et al., 39‚Äì40. = Capitulations = Capitulations were trade deals with other countries. They were a unique practice of Muslim diplomacy that was adopted by Ottoman rulers. In legal and technical terms, they were unilateral agreements made by the Sultan to a nation's merchants. These agreements were temporary, and subject to renewal by subsequent Sultans.Yurdusev et al., 41.Watson, 217. The origins of the capitulations comes from Harun al Rashid and his dealings with the Frankish kingdoms, but they were also used by both his successors and by the Byzantine Empire. In June 1580 came the first capitulatory agreement with England. England acquired privileges formerly limited to France and Venice. The Porte broadened English extraterritorial rights by successive renewals and expansions (in 1603, 1606, 1624, 1641, 1662, and 1675). The Ottoman-French Treaty of 1740 marked the apogee of French influence in the Ottoman Empire in the eighteenth century. In the following years the French had an unchallenged position in Levant trade and in transportation between Ottoman ports. Near contemporary Ottoman capitulations to European powers such as Britain and Holland (1737), the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (1740), Denmark (1756), and Prussia (1761) were to offset and balance the capitulations granted to France in 1740.Robert Olson, \\"The Ottoman-French Treaty of 1740\\" Turkish Studies Association Bulletin (1991) 15#2 pp. 347‚Äì355 online Military organization Sultan Selim III in 1789 to 1807 set up the \\"Nizam-i Cedid\\" [new order] army to replace the inefficient and outmoded imperial army. The old system depended on Janissaries, who had largely lost their military effectiveness. Selim closely followed Western military forms. It would be expensive for a new new treasury ['Irad-i Cedid'] was established . The result was the Porte now had an efficient, European-trained army equipped with modern weapons. However it had fewer than 10,000 soldiers in an era when Western armies were ten to fifty times larger. Furthermore, the Sultan was upsetting the well-established traditional political powers. As a result, it was rarely used, apart from its use against Napoleon's expeditionary force at Gaza and Rosetta. The new army was dissolved by reactionary elements with the overthrow of Selim in 1807, but it became the model of the new Ottoman Army created later in the 19th century.Stanford J. Shaw, \\"The Nizam-1 Cedid Army under Sultan Selim III 1789‚Äì1807.\\" Oriens 18.1 (1966): 168‚Äì184 online.David Nicolle, Armies of the Ottoman Empire 1775‚Äì1820 (Osprey, 1998).  1200‚Äì1500  About 1250 CE the Seljuk Turks were overwhelmed by a Mongol invasion, and they lost control of Anatolia. By 1290, Osman I established supremacy over neighboring Turkish tribes, forming the start of the Ottoman Empire. The Byzantine Empire was shrinking, but it held tenaciously onto its capital at Constantinople.R. Ernest Dupuy and Trevor N. Dupuy, The Encyclopedia of Military History (1977) pp 388‚Äì389. The Ottoman domain became increasingly powerful and by 1400 was a crucial part of the European states system and actively played a role in their affairs, due in part to their coterminous periods of development.Yurdusev et al., 21. In 1413‚Äì1421, Mehmed I \\"The Restorer\\" reestablished central authority in Anatolia. He expanded the Ottoman presence in Europe by the conquest of Wallachia in 1415. Venice destroyed the Turkish fleet of Gallipoli in 1416, as the Ottomans lost a naval war. In the reign of Murad II (1421‚Äì1451) there were successful naval wars with Venice and Milan. The Byzantine Empire lost virtually all its territory in Anatolia. However, the Ottomans failed in their attempted invasions of Serbia and Hungary; they besieged Constantinople. Christians from Central Europe launch the last Crusade in 1443‚Äì1444, pushing the Ottomans out of Serbia and Wallachia. This Crusade ended in defeat when the Ottomans were victorious at Varna in November 1444.Dupuy and Dupuy, The Encyclopedia of Military History (1977) pp 437‚Äì438. Mehmed the Conqueror (1444‚Äì1446, and 1451‚Äì1481) scored the most famous victory in Ottoman history when his army finally on 29 May 1453, captured Constantinople and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire.G. R. Potter, \\"The Fall of Constantinople? History Today (Jan 1953) 3#1 pp 41‚Äì49.Franz Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time (Princeton UP 1992) Towards the end of the 15th century, the Ottomans began to play a larger role in the Italian Peninsula. In 1494, both the Papacy and the Kingdom of Naples petitioned the Sultan directly for his assistance against Charles VIII of France in the First Italian War.Yurdusev et al., 22. The Ottomans continue to expand, and on 28 July 1499 won their greatest naval victory over Venice, in the first battle of Lepanto.Dupuy and Dupuy, Encyclopedia of Military History (1977) p 439.  1500‚Äì1800  Ottoman policy towards Europe during the 16th century was one of disruption against the Habsburg dynasties. The Ottomans collaborated with Francis I of France and his Protestant allies in the 1530s while fighting the Habsburgs.Watson, 177. Although the French had sought an alliance with the Ottomans as early as 1531, one was not concluded until 1536. The sultan then gave the French freedom of trade throughout the empire, and plans were drawn up for an invasion of Italy from both the north and the south in 1537.Inalcik, 36. The most dramatic successes came during the short reign of Selim I (1513‚Äì 1520), as Ottoman territories were nervous nearly doubled in size after decisive victories over the Persians and Egyptians. Selim I defeated the Mameluke army that controlled Egypt in 1517. He conquered Egypt, leaving the Mamelukes as rulers there under a Turkish governor general. Selim I move south and took control of Mecca and the West Arabian Coast, suppressed revolts in Anatolia and Syria, and formed an alliance with Algiers. He died in 1520 as he was preparing an invasion of the island of Rhodes.Dupuy and Dupuy, The Encyclopedia of Military History (1977) pp 495‚Äì501. =Suleiman the Magnificent= Selim I's son Suleiman I became known as \\"Suleiman the Magnificent\\" for his long string of military conquestsG√ºne≈ü I≈üƒ±ksel, \\"Suleiman the Magnificent (1494‚Äì1566).\\" in The Encyclopedia of Diplomacy (2018): 1‚Äì2 online.Metin Kunt and Christine Woodhead, Suleyman the Magnificent & His Age: The Ottoman Empire in the Early Modern World (1995). Suleiman consolidated Ottoman possessions in Europe and made the Danube the undisputed northern frontier.Rhoads Murphey, \\"S√ºleyman I and the Conquest of Hungary: Ottoman Manifest Destiny or a Delayed Reaction to Charles V's Universalist Vision.\\" Journal of Early Modern History 5.3 (2001): 197‚Äì221. The decisive Ottoman victory came at the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526. The forces of the Kingdom of Hungary and its allies, led by Louis II was defeated by Suleiman's army. The result was the three-way partition of Hungary for several centuries between the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy, and the Principality of Transylvania. Louis II was killed, thus ending the Jagiellonian dynasty in Hungary and Bohemia. Its dynastic claims passed to the House of Habsburg. Suleiman selected cooperative local leaders in the newly acquired Wallachian, Moldavian, and Transylvanian Christian territories. The role was to keep the peace, collect taxes, and in turn were protected by the Porte. Later sultans considered replacing these tributary princes with Ottoman Muslim governors but did not do so for political, military, and financial reasons.Viorel Panaite, \\"Power Relationships in the Ottoman Empire: The Sultans and the Tribute-Paying Princes of Wallachia and Moldavia from the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Century.\\" International Journal of Turkish Studies 7.1‚Äì2 (2001): 26‚Äì54. Suleiman's successes frightened the Europeans, but he failed to move north of the Danube, failed to take Vienna, failed to conquer Rome, and was unable to gain a foothold in Italy. The defeats meant that the Ottoman Empire could not take advantage of the intellectual and technical advances made in Western Europe. Instead Suleiman's empire while large, failed to keep pace with the rapid advances taking place in Europe.Subhi Labib, \\"The era of Suleyman the magnificent: crisis of orientation.\\" International journal of Middle East studies 10.4 (1979): 435‚Äì451. Online According to John Norton, additional weaknesses of Suleiman included his conscription of Christian children, maltreatment of subject peoples, and obsession with his own prestige.John D. Norton, \\"Sultan S√ºleyman's Marred Magnificence.\\" Historian (1986), Issue 11, pp 3‚Äì8. The Dutch allied with the Ottomans. Prince William of Orange coordinated his strategic moves with those of the Ottomans during the Turkish negotiations with Philip II of Spain in the 1570s. After the Habsburgs inherited the Portuguese crown in 1580, Dutch forces attacked their Portuguese trading rivals while the Turks, supportive of the Dutch bid for independence, attacked the Habsburgs in Eastern Europe.Watson, 222. =Russo- Turkish War (1676‚Äì1681)= The small-scale inconclusive war with Russia in 1676‚Äì1681 was a defensive move by Russia after the Ottomans expanded into Podolia during the Polish‚ÄìTurkish War of 1672‚Äì1676. The Porte wanted to take over all of the Right-bank Ukraine with the support of its vassal, Hetman Petro Doroshenko. A combination of Russian and Ukrainian forces defeated Doroshenko and his Turkish-Tatar army in 1676. The invaders were badly defeated by the Russians in 1677 at Chyhyryn and lost again in their attack on Chyhyryn in 1678. In 1679‚Äì1680, the Russians repelled the attacks of the Crimean Tatars and signed the Bakhchisaray Peace Treaty on 3 January 1681, which would establish the Russo-Turkish border by the Dnieper.Lucjan Ryszard Lewitter, \\"The Russo-Polish Treaty of 1686 and Its Antecedents.\\" Polish Review (1964): 5‚Äì29 online. = Great Turkish War: 1683‚Äì1699 = The Ottoman Empire in 1683; core possessions in dark green; vassal or autonomous areas in light green. The Great Turkish War or the \\"War of the Holy League\\" was a series of conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and ad hoc European coalition the Holy League (Latin: Sacra Ligua). The Turks lost.Lewitter, \\"The Russo-Polish Treaty of 1686 and Its Antecedents.\\" Polish Review (1964): 5‚Äì29 online. The coalition was organized by Pope Innocent XI and included the Papal States, the Holy Roman Empire under Habsburg Emperor Leopold I, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth of John III Sobieski, and the Venetian Republic; Russia joined the League in 1686. Intensive fighting began in 1683 when Ottoman commander Kara Mustafa brought an army of 200,000 soldiers to besiege, Vienna.Simon Millar, Vienna 1683: Christian Europe Repels the Ottomans (Osprey, 2008) The issue was control of Central and Eastern Europe. By September, the invaders were defeated in full retreat down the Danube. It ended with the signing of the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. The war was a defeat for the Ottoman Empire, which for the first time lost large amounts of territory. It lost lands in Hungary and Poland, as well as part of the western Balkans. The war marked the first time Russia was involved in a western European alliance.John Wolf, The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685‚Äì1715 (1951), pp 15‚Äì53.Kenneth Meyer Setton, Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century (Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, 1991) excerpt =Wars with Russia, 1768‚Äì1774= Following a border incident at Balta, Sultan Mustafa III declared war on Russia on 25 September 1768. The Turks formed an alliance with the Polish opposition forces of the Bar Confederation, while Russia was supported by Great Britain, which offered naval advisers to the Russian navy.Brian L. Davies, The Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774: Catherine II and the Ottoman Empire (Bloomsbury, 2016). The destruction of the Ottoman fleet in Battle of Chesma in 1770 The Polish opposition was defeated by Alexander Suvorov. He was then transferred to the Ottoman theatre of operations, where in 1773 and 1774 he won several minor and major battles following the previous grand successes of the Russian Field-Marshal Pyotr Rumyantsev at Larga and Kagula. Naval operations of the Russian Baltic Fleet in the Mediterranean yielded victories under the command of Aleksey Grigoryevich Orlov. In 1771, Egypt and Syria rebelled against the Ottoman rule, while the Russian fleet totally destroyed the Ottoman Navy at the battle of Chesma. On 21 July 1774, the defeated Ottomans signed the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca, which formally granted independence to the Crimean Khanate; in reality it became dependent on Russia. Russia received 4.5 million rubles and two key seaports allowing the direct access to the Black Sea. The supply of Ottoman forces operating in Moldavia and Wallachia was a major challenge that required well organized logistics. An army of 60,000 soldiers and 40,000 horses required a half-million kilograms of food per day. The Ottoman forces fared better than the Russians, but the expenses crippled both national treasuries. Supplies on both sides came using fixed prices, taxes, and confiscation.Virginia H.

Bailey, \\"The Economics of British Foreign Policy, 1825‚Äì50.\\" Journal of Modern History 12.4 (1940): 449‚Äì484 online. Three British leaders played major roles. Lord Palmerston in the 1830‚Äì65 era considered the Ottoman Empire an essential component in the balance of power, was the most favourable toward Constantinople. William Gladstone in the 1870s sought to build a Concert of Europe that would support the survival of the empire. In the 1880s and 1890s Lord Salisbury contemplated an orderly dismemberment of it, in such a way as to reduce rivalry between the greater powers.David Steele, \\"Three British Prime Ministers and the Survival of the Ottoman Empire, 1855‚Äì1902.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 50.1 (2014): 43‚Äì60. =Selim III= Grand Vizier advancing to Sofia (in occupied Bulgaria) in May 1788, to fight both the Austrian and Russian armies. Selim III (1789‚Äì1807) in 1789 found that the Empire had been considerably reduced due to conflicts outside the realm. From the north Russia had taken the Black Sea through the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca in 1774. Selim realized the importance of diplomatic relations with other nations, and pushed for permanent embassies in the courts of all the great nations of Europe, a hard task because of religious prejudice towards Muslims. Even with the religious obstacles, resident embassies were established in London, Paris, Berlin and Vienna.Carter V. Findley, \\"The foundation of the Ottoman Foreign Ministry: the beginnings of bureaucratic reform under Sel√Æm III and Mahm√ªd II.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 3.4 (1972): 388‚Äì416 online. Selim, a cultured poet and musician, carried on an extended correspondence with Louis XVI of France. Although distressed by the establishment of the republic in France, Ottoman government was soothed by French representatives in Constantinople who maintained the goodwill of various influential personages.Thomas Naff, \\"Reform and the Conduct of Ottoman Diplomacy in the Reign of Selim III, 1789-1807.\\" Journal of the American Oriental Society 83.3 (1963): 295-315 online. In July 1798, however, French forces under Napoleon landed in Egypt, and Selim declared war on France. In alliance with Russia and Britain, the Turks were in periodic conflict with the French on both land and sea until March 1801. Peace came in June 1802, The following year brought trouble in the Balkans. For decades a sultan's word had had no power in outlying provinces, prompting Selim's reforms of the military in order to reimpose central control. This desire was not fulfilled. One rebellious leader was Austrian-backed Osman Pazvantoƒülu, whose invasion of Wallachia in 1801 inspired Russian intervention, resulting in greater autonomy for the Dunubian provinces. Serbian conditions also deteriorated. They took a fateful turn with the return of the hated Janissaries, ousted 8 years before. These forces murdered Selim's enlightened governor, ending the best rule this province had had in the last 100 years. Neither arms nor diplomacy could restore Ottoman authority. =Loss of Egypt: 1798‚Äì1805= The brief French invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte began in 1798. Napoleon won early victories and made an initially successful expedition into Syria. The British Royal Navy sank the French fleet at Battle of the Nile. Napoleon managed to escape with a small staff in 1799, leaving the army behind. When peace with Britain came (briefly) in 1803 Napoleon brought home his Arm√©e d'Orient.Paul Strathern, Napoleon in Egypt: The Greatest Glory (2007) online The expulsion of the French in 1801 by Ottoman, Mamluk, and British forces was followed by four years of anarchy in which Ottomans, Mamluks, and Albanians ‚Äî who were nominally in the service of the Ottomans ‚Äì wrestled for power. Out of this chaos, the commander of the Albanian regiment, Muhammad Ali (Kavalali Mehmed Ali Pasha) emerged as a dominant figure and in 1805 was acknowledged by the Sultan as his \\"viceroy\\" in Egypt; the title implied subordination to the Sultan but this was in fact a polite fiction: Ottoman power in Egypt was finished and Muhammad Ali, an ambitious and able leader, established a dynasty in Egypt that lasted until 1952.M. Abir, \\"Modernisation, Reaction and Muhammad Ali's 'Empire'\\" Middle Eastern Studies 13#3 (1977), pp. 295‚Äì313 online =Russo-Turkish War (1806‚Äì1812)= French influence with the Sublime Porte led the Sultan into defying both St. Petersburg and London, and instead joined Napoleon's Continental System. War was declared on Russia on 27 December and on Britain in March 1807. The Ottomans did poorly. Constantinople negotiated for peace in the Treaty of Bucharest (1812). The Porte above all wanted to stay out of the impending conflict between Napoleon and Russia. The Russians wanted no side war and thus they made peace in order to be free for the potential war with France. The Treaty of Bucharest ceded to Russia the eastern half of the Principality of Moldavia, as well as Bessarabia. Russia obtained trading rights on the Danube. The Porte ended hostilities and granted autonomy to Serbia. In Transcaucasia, the Ottomans renounced their claims to most of western Georgia. Russia returned control of Akhalkalaki, Poti, and Anapa.John F. Baddeley, Russian Conquest of the Caucasus (1908), Chapter V The Ottomans had extricated themselves from a potentially disastrous war with a slight loss of territory. This treaty became the basis for future Russo-Ottoman relations.F. Ismail, \\"The making of the treaty of Bucharest, 1811‚Äì1812,\\" Middle Eastern Studies (1979) 15#2 pp 163‚Äì192 online. =Greek War of Independence 1821‚Äì1830= The Greek War of Independence was a successful uprising waged by Greek revolutionaries against the Ottoman Empire between 1821 and 1830. The Greeks were factionalized and fought their own civil war. The Greeks won widespread support from elite opinion in Europe, and were aided militarily and diplomatically by Great Britain, France and Russia. The Ottomans were aided militarily by Egypt.W. Alison Phillips, The war of Greek independence, 1821 to 1833 (1897) onlineJ. A. R. Marriott, The Eastern Question An Historical Study in European Diplomacy (1940) pp 193‚Äì225. online Greece came under Ottoman rule in the late 15th century. During the following centuries, there were sporadic but unsuccessful Greek uprisings against Ottoman rule. In 1814, a secret organization called Filiki Eteria (Society of Friends) was founded with the aim of liberating Greece, encouraged by the revolutionary fervor gripping Europe in that period. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolts in the Peloponnese, the Danubian Principalities, and Constantinople itself, which had a large Greek element. The first revolt began on 6 March/21 February 1821 in the Danubian Principalities, but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese (Morea) into action and on 17 March 1821, the Maniots were first to declare war. In September 1821, the Greeks under the leadership of Theodoros Kolokotronis captured Tripolitsa. Revolts in Crete, Macedonia, and Central Greece broke out, but were eventually suppressed. Meanwhile, makeshift Greek fleets achieved success against the Ottoman Navy in the Aegean Sea and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea. Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. The Ottoman Sultan called in Muhammad Ali of Egypt, who sent his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gains. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and brought most of the peninsula under Egyptian control by the end of that year. Despite a failed invasion of Mani, Athens also fell and the revolution looked all but lost. At that point, the three Great Powers‚ÄîRussia, Britain and France‚Äîdecided to intervene, sending their naval squadrons to Greece in 1827. Following news that the combined Ottoman‚ÄìEgyptian fleet was going to attack the island of Hydra, the allied fleets intercepted the Ottoman navy and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Navarino. In 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a French expeditionary force. The Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese surrendered, and the Greek revolutionaries proceeded to retake central Greece. Russia invaded the Ottoman Empire and forced it to accept Greek autonomy in the Treaty of Adrianople (1829). After nine years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent state under the London Protocol of February 1830. Further negotiations in 1832 led to the London Conference and the Treaty of Constantinople; these defined the final borders of the new state and established Prince Otto of Bavaria as the first king of Greece. =Serbian Revolution and Autonomous Principality (1804‚Äì1878)= Serbia gained considerable internal autonomy from the Ottoman Empire in two uprisings in 1804 (led by ƒêorƒëe Petroviƒá ‚Äì Karaƒëorƒëe) and 1815 (led by Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá). Ottoman troops continued to garrison the capital, Belgrade, until 1867. The Serbs launched not only a national revolution but a social one as well. Complete independence arrived in 1878. Serbian activists promoted ethnic nationalism in the Balkans, targeting both the remnants of the Ottoman Empire and the equally fragile Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Serbia followed Montenegro against the Ottomans, and one full independence from the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Serbia played a central role in the Balkan wars of the early 20th century, which practically eliminated the Ottoman presence in EuropeHarry N. Howard, \\"The Balkan Wars in perspective: their significance for Turkey.\\" Balkan Studies 3.2 (1962): 267‚Äì276. =Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29)= The Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829 was sparked by the Greek War of Independence of 1821‚Äì1829. War broke out after the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II closed the Dardanelles to Russian ships and revoked the 1826 Akkerman Convention in retaliation for Russian participation in October 1827 in the Battle of Navarino. The results included Russian victory, Treaty of Adrianople, Russian occupation of Danubian Principalities, Greek victory and independence from the Ottoman Empire =Persian Gulf= Britain planned bases in the Persian Gulf region to protect India. Yemen was the first choice, since it was a convenient port. By 1800 the Porte permitted the creation of British trading stations in Mocha, Yemen. British intrigues with local leaders troubled the Porte which in 1818 asked Muhammad Ali to pacify the region. The British government worked with Ali to take over the strategically significant port of Aden, despite opposition from Constantinople.Caesar E. Farah, \\"Reaffirming Ottoman Sovereignty in Yemen, 1825‚Äì1840\\" International Journal of Turkish Studies (1984) 3#1 pp 101‚Äì116. The Ottomans were concerned about the British expansion from India into the Red Sea and Arabia. They returned to the Tihamah in 1849 after an absence of two centuries. =Financial crisis = Economic stagnation prevailed in Ottoman lands areas in the 1840s and 1850s at a time when rapid industrialization characterized Britain and Western Europe‚Äîareas that also expanded their commerce in the Levant. The Porte had serious economic problems‚Äîstagnant tax revenue, inflation, growing expenses. Despite the sultan's fear of British penetration, it borrowed heavily from banks in Paris and London and did not set up its own banks.Frederick S. Rodkey, \\"Ottoman Concern about Western Economic Penetration in the Levant, 1849‚Äì1856.\\" Journal of Modern History 30.4 (1958): 348‚Äì353 online. =Crimean War 1854‚Äì56= The Crimean War (1854‚Äì56) was fought between Russia on the one hand and an alliance of Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire on the other. Russia was defeated but the casualties were very heavy on all sides, and historians look at the entire episode as a series of blunders.A.J.P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848‚Äì1918 (1954) pp 62‚Äì82A.J.P. Taylor, \\"The war that would not boil,\\" History Today (1951) 1#2 pp 23‚Äì31. The war began with Russian demands to protect Christian sites in the Holy Land. The churches quickly settled that problem, but it escalated out of hand as Russia put continuous pressure on the Ottomans. Diplomatic efforts failed. The Sultan declared war against Russia in October 1851. Following an Ottoman naval disaster in November, Britain and France declared war against Russia.Kingsley Martin, The triumph of Lord Palmerston: a study of public opinion in England before the Crimean War (Hutchinson, 1963). online It proved quite difficult to reach Russian territory, and the Royal Navy could not defeat the Russian defences in the Baltic. Most of the battles took place in the Crimean peninsula, which the Allies finally seized. London, shocked to discover that France was secretly negotiating with Russia to form a postwar alliance to dominate Europe, dropped its plans to attack St. Petersburg and instead signed a one-sided armistice with Russia that achieved almost none of its war aims. Diplomats at the Congress of Paris, 1856, settled the Crimean War; painting by Edouard Louis Dubufe. The Treaty of Paris signed 30 March 1856, ended the war. Russia gave up a little land and relinquished its claim to a protectorate over the Christians in the Ottoman domains. The Black Sea was demilitarized, and an international commission was set up to guarantee freedom of commerce and navigation on the Danube River. Moldavia and Wallachia remained under nominal Ottoman rule, but would be granted independent constitutions and national assemblies. However, by 1870, the Russians had regained most of their concessions.Harold Temperley, \\"The Treaty of Paris of 1856 and Its Execution,\\" Journal of Modern History (1932) 4#3 pp. 387‚Äì414 in JSTOR The war helped modernize warfare by introducing major new technologies such as railways, the telegraph, and modern nursing methods. The Ottoman Empire and Russia, with their weak industrial bases, could not keep up with the major powers, so they could no longer promote stability. This opened the way for Napoleon III in France and Otto von Bismarck in Prussia to launch a series of wars in the 1860s that reshaped Europe.Stephen J. Lee, Aspects of European History 1789‚Äì1980 (2001) pp 67‚Äì74 Ottoman losses in yellow in the Balkans after the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), from Literary and Historical Atlas of Europe by J. G. Bartholomew, 1912 =Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878)= The Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878 saw the Ottomans lose to a coalition led by the Russian Empire and composed of Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro. Russia and its allies declared war in order to gain access to the Mediterranean through the Turkish Straits. The main battles were fought on land in Anatolia/Caucasus and Rumelia. After losing the siege at Plevna, the Ottomans gave up and signed the punitive Treaty of San Stefano. That treaty built up a powerful Bulgaria. The European powers rejected that solution and met at the Congress of Berlin. Even though the Porte was not invited the powers returned half the Ottoman losses at the Treaty of Berlin in July 1878. The war originated in emerging Balkan nationalism and Orthodox Christian religion. Additional factors included Russian goals of recovering territorial losses endured during the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì56, re-establishing itself in the Black Sea and supporting the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire. As a result, Russia succeeded in claiming provinces in the Caucasus (Kars and Batum). Russia also annexed the Budjak region. The principalities of Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro, each of which had de facto sovereignty for some time, formally proclaimed independence from the Porte. After almost five centuries of Ottoman domination (1396‚Äì1878), a Bulgarian state re-emerged: the Principality of Bulgaria, covering the land between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains (except Northern Dobrudja which was given to Romania), as well as the region of Sofia, which became Bulgaria's capital. The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria-Hungary to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus.G√ºltekin Yildiz, \\"Russo-Ottoman War, 1877‚Äì1878.\\" in Richard C. Hall, ed., War in the Balkans (2014): 256‚Äì258 online. A surprising consequence came in Hungary (part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). Despite memories of the terrible defeat at Moh√°cs in 1526, elite Hungarian attitudes were become strongly anti-Russian This led to led to active support for the Turks in the media, but only in a peaceful way, since the foreign policy of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy remained neutral.Iv√°n Bert√©nyi, \\"Enthusiasm for a Hereditary Enemy: Some Aspects of The Roots of Hungarian Turkophile Sentiments.\\" Hungarian Studies 27.2 (2013): 209‚Äì218 online. =British takeover of Egypt, 1882= The most decisive event emerged from the Anglo-Egyptian War, which resulted in the occupation of Egypt. although the Ottoman Empire was the nominal owner, in practice Britain made all the decisions.Selim Deringil, \\"The Ottoman Response to the Egyptian Crisis of 1881‚Äì82\\" Middle Eastern Studies (1988) 24#1 pp. 3‚Äì24 online In 1914, Britain went to war with the Ottomans and ended their nominal role. Historian A. J. P. Taylor says that the seizure, which lasted seven decades, \\"was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia and the Russo- Japanese war.\\"He adds, \\"All the rest were maneuvers which left the combatants at the close of the day exactly where they had started. A.J.P. Taylor, \\"International Relations\\" in F.H. Hinsley, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History: XI: Material Progress and World-Wide Problems, 1870‚Äì98 (1962): 554. Taylor emphasizes long-term impact: :The British occupation of Egypt altered the balance of power. It not only gave the British security for their route to India; it made them masters of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East; it made it unnecessary for them to stand in the front line against Russia at the Straits....And thus prepared the way for the Franco-Russian Alliance ten years later.Taylor, \\"International Relations\\" p 554 20th century In 1897 the population was 19 million, of whom 14 million (74%) were Muslim. An additional 20 million lived in provinces which remained under the sultan's nominal suzerainty but were entirely outside his actual power. One by one the Porte lost nominal authority. They included Egypt, Tunisia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Lebanon.Stanford J. Shaw and Ezel Kural Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (1977) 2:236. =Entry in to World War I= Germany for years had worked to develop closer ties to the Ottoman Empire. In 1914, the old Ottoman enemy Russia was at war with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and Constantinople distrusted London for its role in Egypt.Kemal H. Karpat, \\"The entry of the Ottoman empire into world war I.\\" Belleten 68.253 (2004): 1‚Äì40. online Conquest of Constantinople was a main Russian war goal. The Porte was neutral at first but leaned toward Germany. Its old protector Britain was no longer a close ally. The Ottoman entry into World War I began when two recently purchased ships of its navy, still manned by their German crews and commanded by their German admiral, carried out the Black Sea Raid, a surprise attack against Russian ports, on 29 October 1914. Russia replied by declaring war on 1 November 1914 and Russia's allies, Britain and France, then declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November 1914.Ali Balci, et al. \\"War Decision and Neoclassical Realism: The Entry of the Ottoman Empire into the First World War.\\" War in History (2018), online There were a number of factors that conspired to influence the Ottoman government, and encourage them into entering the war. According to Kemal Karpat: : Ottoman entry into the war was not the consequence of careful preparation and long debate in the parliament (which was recessed) and press. It was the result of a hasty decision by a handful of elitist leaders who disregarded democratic procedures, lacked long-range political vision, and fell easy victim to German machinations and their own utopian expectations of recovering the lost territories in the Balkans. The Ottoman entry into war prolonged it for two years and allowed the Bolshevik revolution to incubate and then explode in 1917, which in turn profoundly impacted the course of world history in the 20th century.Kemal Karpat, 2004. This decision ultimately led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ottomans, the Armenian Genocide, the dissolution of the empire, and the abolition of the Islamic Caliphate.Yiƒüit Akƒ±n, When the War Came Home: The Ottomans' Great War and the Devastation of an Empire.

The lake is also used heavily for sports, such as kitesurfing and windsurfing in the summertime. In the winter, once the lake freezes, it is used for cross country skiing, walking trails, and kitesurfing on snow, with the famous Engadin Skimarathon crossing the lake annually.

With his four brothers, after 1823 he became an agent of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. Later he became one of the company's co-owners, exploiting the riches of the Oregon Country. He helped settle and improve the best routes for migrants along the Oregon Trail. Early life William Sublette was born near Stanford, Lincoln County, Kentucky. He was one of five Sublette brothers, who all became prominent in the western fur trade: William, Milton, Andrew, Pinkney, and Solomon. They had ties to traders in St. Louis, Missouri which had built its early wealth in the fur trade. It had several families with prominent connections, ranging from tribes on the Upper Missouri River and into the Rocky Mountains, to Spanish towns in the Southwest along the Santa Fe Trail. Fur trading Sublette was among the mountain men who journeyed into the Rocky Mountains and other Unorganized territories, which were often economically controlled by the joint British-Canadian fur companies of Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company. Both companies competed against the activities of the American Fur Company, founded by John Jacob Astor, who created a monopoly in the American West before 1830. Sublette and his brothers were based in St. Louis, which had built its early wealth from fur trading. Sublette retired from trapping after being wounded at the Rendezvous of 1832 in the Battle of Pierre's Hole. Some accounts said that he had caused the conflict. After recuperating for over a year back in St. Louis, Sublette returned to the uplands and founded Fort William, in the foothills east of the South Pass. The fort commanded the last eastern stream crossing at the foot of the last ascent to the floor of South Pass. That was the only route readily navigable by wagons over the continental divide. In 1823, William was recruited in St. Louis by William Henry Ashley, as part of a fur trapping contingent, later referred to as Ashley's Hundred. That was the beginning of a new strategy for conducting the fur trade in response to a change in United States law in 1822. Liquor had been one of the principal currencies traded to Amerindians; such trafficking had been made illegal. The new scheme set up a trapper's rendezvous, a teamster-drover team operating the freight bringing in supplies and returning with furs, and a corp of trappers making their circuit through the year to traps they had set as team members. By 1826, Sublette acquired Ashley's fur business, along with Jedediah Smith and David Edward Jackson. His brother Milton, in the mid-1830s, was one of five men who bought the Rocky Mountain Fur Company from William and his partners.Carter, Harvey L. \\"Robert Campbell\\" and Doyce B. Nunis, Jr. \\"Milton G. Sublette\\", featured in Trappers of the Far West, Leroy R. Hafen, editor. 1972, Arthur H. Clark Company, reprint University of Nebraska Press, October 1983. In 1832, Sublette was wounded in the Battle of Pierre's Hole at a rendezvous in Idaho. After further fur business ventures, he sold Fort William to the American Fur Company, who renamed it Fort John. After the US Army took it over, they renamed it again as Fort Laramie. Sublette retired to St. Louis, where he died in 1845. He was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in northern St. Louis. =Legacy and honors = *Sublette County in Wyoming was named for him * Sublette Street in Pocatello, Idaho was named for him *The city of Sublette, Kansas,Kansas Place-Names, John Rydjord, University of Oklahoma Press, 1972, p. 121 *The Sublett Range in Southeast Idaho is named for him *Sublette Park and Avenue in St. Louis are named for him.https://www.stlouis- mo.gov/government/departments/parks/parks/browse-parks/view- park.cfm?parkID=83&parkName;=Sublette See also *Jim Bridger *Kit Carson Footnotes Category:American explorers Category:Mountain men Category:Oregon Trail Category:1799 births Category:1845 deaths Category:American fur traders ","title":"William Sublette"},{"id":"8000945","text":"Ra√∫l Horacio Madero (b. Buenos Aires, May 21, 1939) is an Argentine sports physician and former football player. He served two terms as the physician of the Argentina national football team. Sporting career As a teenager, Madero was drawn initially to basketball, but decided on football when it became clear he had the talent to make it in the professional league. He played for Boca Juniors and Hurac√°n but he came into his own with the Estudiantes de La Plata team that won several national and international titles between 1967 and 1970. He was also cited for the national team. He scored only nine goals for Estudiantes, but one of these goals was a crucial header against Quilmes that helped Estudiantes avoid relegation. Madero provided firmness but also elegance as a defender, playing alongside the less- polished Ram√≥n Aguirre Su√°rez. Honours ;Estudiantes *Primera Divisi√≥n Argentina: Metropolitano 1967 *Copa Libertadores: 1968, 1969, 1970 *Copa Interamericana: 1968 *Intercontinental Cup: 1968 Medical career Madero and fellow player Carlos Bilardo retired after graduating as Medical Doctors. While Bilardo remained in football as a coach, Madero chose to specialize in sports medicine. In the late 1970s, he was team physician at Argentinos Juniors. When Diego Maradona transferred from Argentinos to Boca Juniors, Madero went with him and took part in the successful 1981 championship campaign. In 1983, newly minted national coach Bilardo asked his friend Madero to be the physician of the Argentina national football team. Madero accepted, and remained in the position until 1990. Argentina was champion of FIFA World Cup 1986 and finalist in the 1990 edition. The fitness trainer was another Estudiantes veteran, Ricardo Echevarr√≠a. After Bilardo's departure and a tenure as head of medicine with the Argentine Football Association, in 1996 Madero was made a member of FIFA's Sports Medical Committee and the FIFA Medical Assessment and Research Centre (F-MARC). In 2007, Madero was designated again as physician for the national team under coach Alfio Basile, who was Madero's teammate in the national team in the late sixties . Madero endorsed FIFA's decision to prohibit the playing of international matches at a height of 2500 m (8200 ft) and above, citing medical concerns (notably, the increased incidence of respiratory alkalosis when playing in oxygen-poor environments). In 2009, Maradona and Bilardo, now coach and manager of the national team, decided to reinstate Donato Villani as team physician, thus ending Madero's second term. Madero is also head of the Sports Medicine program in the Buenos Aires branch of the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina .

The higher the ICOR, the lower the productivity of capital or the marginal efficiency of capital. The ICOR can be thought of as a measure of the inefficiency with which capital is used. In most countries the ICOR is in the neighborhood of 3. It is a topic discussed in economic growth. It can be expressed in the following formula, where K is capital output ratio, Y is output (GDP), and I is net investment. \\\\text{incremental capital output ratio} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta K}{\\\\Delta Y} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\Delta K}{Y}}{\\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y}}= \\\\frac{\\\\frac{I}{Y}}{\\\\frac{\\\\Delta Y}{Y}} According to this formula the incremental capital output ratio can be computed by dividing the investment share in GDP by the rate of growth of GDP. As an example, if the level of investment (as a share of GDP) in a developing country had been (approximately) 20% over a particular period, and if the growth rate of GDP had been (approximately) 5% per year during the same period, then the ICOR would be 20/5 = 4.

People at the Nordic institutes, on the other hand, didn't subscribe to Sommerfelt's methods, and there was little contact between them and the structuralists until the 1960s. Together with the Slavicist Olaf Broch, Sommerfelt founded the Norwegian association for linguistics in 1924, an association that would play an important part in the introduction of new linguistic theories to Norway. Sommerfelt wrote several popular introductions to linguistics. He also wrote an introductory book on general linguistics (1947), a book read by all the linguistics students at the university of Oslo, and reprinted ten years later. Sommerfelt was also one of the editors of Norsk riksm√•lsordbog (the Norwegian Riksm√•l dictionary).

Survey markers, also called survey marks, survey monuments, survey benchmarks or geodetic marks, are objects placed to mark key survey points on the Earth's surface. They are used in geodetic and land surveying. Informally, such marks are referred to as benchmarks,A popular hobby, known as \\"benchmarking hunting\\", has grown up around the pastime of recovering (or \\"re-finding\\") these marks. In the U.S., the hobby has a website that enables hobbyists to plan and report on their efforts. although strictly speaking the term \\"benchmark\\" is reserved for marks that indicate elevation. Horizontal position markers used for triangulation are also known as triangulation stations. Types All sorts of different objects, ranging from the familiar brass disks to liquor bottles, clay pots, and rock cairns, have been used over the years as survey markers.For a comprehensive history of these marks in the United States, together with photos of all of the key variations, see the PDF of the article by CDR George E. Leigh, NOAA Corps (Ret‚Äôd.). Some truly monumental markers have been used to designate tripoints, or the meeting points of three or more countries. In the 19th century, these marks were often drill holes in rock ledges, crosses or triangles chiselled in rock, or copper or brass bolts sunk into bedrock. Today in the United States, the most common geodetic survey marks are cast metal disks with stamped legends on their face set in rock ledges, embedded in the tops of concrete pillars, or affixed to the tops of pipes that have been sunk into the ground. These marks are intended to be permanent, and disturbing them is generally prohibited by federal and state law. Survey markers in Nagoya, Japan, which bear stylized images of shachihoko, are noted for their elaborate design.Survey markers and road ledger markers in Nagoya History Survey markers were often placed as part of triangulation surveys, measurement efforts that moved systematically across states or regions, establishing the angles and distances between various points. Such surveys laid the basis for map-making across the world. Geodetic survey markers were often set in groups. For example, in triangulation surveys, the primary point identified was called the triangulation station, or the \\"main station\\". It was often marked by a \\"station disk\\" (see upper photo at left), a brass disk with a triangle inscribed on its surface and an impressed mark that indicated the precise point over which a surveyor's plumb-bob should be dropped to assure a precise location over it. A triangulation station was often surrounded by several (usually three) reference marks (see second photo at left),These marks were often set at roughly equal (120-degree) intervals from each other and were numbered in ascending order moving clockwise around the main station. each of which bore an arrow that pointed back towards the main station. These reference marks made it easier for later visitors to \\"recover\\" (or re-find) the primary (\\"station\\") mark. Reference marks also made it possible to replace (or reset) a station mark that had been disturbed or destroyed. Some old station marks were buried several feet down (to protect them from being struck by ploughs). Occasionally, these buried marks had surface marks set directly above them.Here is an account of recovering (re-finding) a buried station mark from 1890 for which the surface mark had been destroyed. This account also describes the use of reference marks to locate station marks. Database In the U.S., survey marks that meet certain standards for accuracy are part of a national database that is maintained by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS).The NGS is the successor agency to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS). Each station mark in the database has a PID (Permanent IDentifier), a unique 6-character code that can be used to call up a datasheet describing that station.Here is a sample datasheet that describes a triangulation station with three reference marks. Distances and directions from the station to these reference marks are given in the outlined box on the datasheet. Originally there were a number of references to surrounding structures, but these structures were all later reported as destroyed. A later visitor then provided some new references. The NGS has a web-based formThe NGS datasheet-from-PID form is located here. that can be used to access any datasheet, if the station's PID is known. Alternatively, datasheets can be called up by station name.Here is the NGS web-based form for getting a datasheet for a station with a known name. A typical datasheet has either the precise or the estimated coordinates. Precise coordinates are called \\"adjusted\\" and result from precise surveys. Estimated coordinates are termed \\"scaled\\" and have usually been set by locating the point on a map and reading off its latitude and longitude. Scaled coordinates can be as much as several thousand feet distant from the true positions of their marks. In the U.S., some survey markers have the latitude and longitude of the station mark, a listing of any reference marks (with their distance and bearing from the station mark), and a narrative (which is updated over the years) describing other reference features (e.g., buildings, roadways, trees, or fire hydrants) and the distance and/or direction of these features from the marks, and giving a history of past efforts to recover (or re-find) these marks (including any resets of the marks, or evidence of their damage or destruction). Current best practice for stability of new survey markers is to use a punch mark stamped in the top of a metal rod driven deep into the ground, surrounded by a grease filled sleeve, and covered with a hinged cap set in concrete.NOAA - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Survey markers are now often used to set up a GPS receiver antenna in a known position for use in Differential GPS surveying.In the U.S., even though surveys carried out primarily by GPS are becoming more common, the network of physical survey markers continues to provide an important check on the accuracy of GPS-based methods, and one that is not dependent on satellites orbiting the earth. In Brazil, a similar database is operated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statisticshttp://www.bdg.ibge.gov.br/appbdg/.

When the station opened in 1854 it was at first called Gammer LaneSuggitt, p.50; Biddle, pl.43 (which appears to be a misspelling of Gamull Lane, on which the station was located). Two years later, the line was bought by the Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway and the station was renamed Fulwood Station. Between 1863 and 1866 there was another short-lived station called Ribbleton, closer to Preston. It was not until 1900 that Fulwood Station was finally renamed Ribbleton Station. The station closed to passengers, along with the line, in 1930. The line through the station continued to be used for goods trains until 1980. After closure the Gamull Lane bridge over the line was removed. The station building still stands, as a private house with the former trackbed through its garden.

First used by English nobles during the late 18th century, the coppola began to be used in Sicily and Calabria in the early 20th century as a driving cap, usually worn when at the wheel driving the car.

Usually the first flight rises to a half-landing and then divides into two symmetrical flights both rising with an equal number of steps and turns to the next floor. The feature is reputed to have first been used at El Escorial.Wilkinson, Catherine. The Escorial and the Invention of the Imperial Staircase. The Art Bulletin, Vol. 57, No. 1 (March, 1975), pp. 65-90. One of the grandest examples, the Escalier des Ambassadeurs at the Palace of Versailles, was built by 1680 but demolished in 1752 as the palace was rearranged.images on Wikimedia Commons The Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace is a notable example, while other such staircases can be found at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Palazzo Reale di Caserta, Palacio Real de Madrid and Mentmore Towers. The advantages of an imperial staircase became apparent during the 18th century, when Matthew Brettingham revolutionised the design of the piano nobile of the London town house. Guests would proceed through a series of reception rooms arranged as a circuit. Girouard, Mark (1978). Life in the English Country House. Yale University Press. . P. 197 At large gatherings the two branches could ease the flow of guests arriving and departing, or moving between a ballroom and a supper room on the floor below. An imperial staircase is often used today for similar reasons where two streams of people are moving in opposite directions in buildings as diverse as an opera house to a railway station. This use explains why the first single flight is often wider than the following two divided flights, although narrowing flights are also an architectural trick to lengthen perspective in order to increase the impression of size. An imperial staircase should not be confused with a double staircase, an external feature and common motif seen rising to the entrances of many houses in the Palladian style, such as those at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire. Double staircases as opposed to imperial staircases are more often of just two flights (hence the name) leaving the ground symmetrically to join one common destination. Occasionally, especially in the architecture of the Sicilian Baroque, they will leave the ground as one flight and then divide, but this is less common. One may also see an imperial staircase in the form of two flights rising to join and then continue as one flight, but this is rare.

The publication focuses on the newsworthy events in St. Thomas and surrounding municipalities, such as the sports teams of Aylmer. History St. Thomas and Elgin County are served by a small city daily newspaper - The St. Thomas Times-Journal. Since July 2, 1918, this newspaper has carried that name across its masthead. It represents the amalgamation of the two daily newspapers that served St. Thomas and Elgin for many years, the St. Thomas Times and the St. Thomas Journal. The predecessors of these two dailies were started as weekly publications years before St. Thomas reached the size where the publishers felt that daily publication was warranted. St. Thomas has had newspapers since 1831 when the first weekly appeared. It was not only the first newspaper in St. Thomas but also the first to be called the Journal. George and Thomas Hodgkinson, brothers, were the publishers and editors. Their paper had been in existence only a year when a competitor called the Liberal came out in 1832, with Asahel B. Lewis as its editor. In 1833, the Rev. Donald Fraser, a Presbyterian minister only recently arrived from Scotland, became the editor of the Journal, while in 1834, two men named Kent and Kipp acquired the Liberal. Within three years, both papers were out of existence. From then until 1873, St. Thomas had many newspaper ventures, all of them short-lived, except McLachlin's Journal and Wilkinson's Times. To mention a few of the short-lived newspapers that appeared during that period: the St. Thomas Enquirer, started by John Kent (newspaperman) in 1837; the St. Thomas Chronicle, which was begun by O'Reilly and Newcombe in 1843; The Canadian Freeman, edited by L. Cunningham Kearney from 1846 to 1851; the St. Thomas Watchman made a brief appearance; then followed the Weekly Dispatch and the British Standard. The Journal was the first to appear in daily form. On Sept. 3, 1881, James S. Brierley, later publisher of the Montreal Herald, with E.E. Sheppard and William Westlake, bought out the St. Thomas Evening Journal, after buying the semi-weekly Home Journal from Archibald McLachlin, pioneer bookseller and publisher of St. Thomas. Westlake died before the first issue came out; and in 1883, Brierley acquired sole ownership of the Journal, continuing until 1906 when he sold the paper to the Arthur S. Smith of St. Thomas, who disposed of it the following year to F.W. Sutherland, now president and general manager of Sutherland Press, Limited, of St. Thomas. From 1896 until 1906, Brierley published both the St. Thomas Journal and the Montreal Herald, being president and general manager of the latter newspaper until his death. The St. Thomas Times was started as a weekly by Jonathan Wilkinson, an experienced newspaperman from Guelph, in 1871. The Times did not become a daily until Dec. 2, 1882. For many years both the Times and the Journal continued to publish weekly editions, both having wide rural circulations. In 1889, A.E. Wallace and John W. Eedy bought the Times from Wilkinson, then in 1902, L.H. Dingman, who had come to St. Thomas a few years before from Stratford, as business manager of the Journal, became owner and published of the Times. He has been actively identified in the editing and publication of St. Thomas' daily newspapers ever since. With the amalgamation of the two dailies in 1918, Dingman became president and treasurer of The Times-Journal of St. Thomas, Limited. For many years he was also the managing editor of The Times-Journal. A rather serious fire in the Journal building, only about a block east of the Times building, was a factor in bringing about the amalgamation. After the fire, for some time, both papers were printed on the Times press. Later the Times-Journal was purchased by Lord Thomson and became part of the Thomson chain of newspapers.Copied from History of St. Thomas Times-Journal, which took it from the book , the copyright for which expired at the end of 2001, given that it was one of the recognized \\"Anonymous and pseudonymous works of joint authorship\\" or \\"Anonymous and pseudonymous works\\" produced in Canada per the Canadian Copyright Act ( R.S., 1985, c.

Cribari was signed by Udinese along with Antonio Di Natale and Manuel Belleri. Cribari joined Lazio in 2005 from Udinese in temporary deal. In 2006 Lazio signed him outright for ‚Ç¨3 million. In his first two seasons, he established himself as a regular in the Biancoceleste defence, and gained a reputation as a quality and uncompromising player. Cribari was a key man in Lazio's successful season in 2006‚Äì07, when they achieved a third-place finish to qualify for the Champions League. He fractured his jaw and cheekbone in Lazio's UEFA Champions League clash with Dinamo Bucharest and was initially ruled out for over two months, but managed to return for Lazio's second leg win only two weeks later.

Early life Born in Augusta, Georgia, he was the son of Henry Harford Cumming, a cotton magnate, and Julia Ann (Bryan) Cumming. At twenty, he graduated from West Point, ranking 35th in his class of 43. In the prewar United States Army, he served mainly in the West, including two years in Louisiana as an aide to Brig. Gen. David E. Twiggs. Later he accompanied Albert Sidney Johnston's expedition to Utah Territory, where he aided his uncle, Alfred Cumming (the Governor of Utah) in the Utah War. Civil War Flag of Cumming's Brigade, 1863. In January 1861, he resigned a captaincy in the 10th United States Infantry to accept the Lieutenant Colonelcy of the Augusta Volunteer Battalion. He soon resigned that position to become major of the 1st Georgia Infantry. By June, he was the Lieutenant Colonel of the 10th Georgia Infantry Regiment and four months later its colonel, succeeding Lafayette McLaws. He served with distinction during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, including the Battle of Yorktown, the Battle of Savage's Station, and the Battle of Malvern Hill, where he was wounded. His performance earned him the temporary command of an Alabama brigade prior to the Maryland Campaign due to the illness of Brigadier General Cadmus M. Wilcox. On September 14, 1862, Cumming's brigade came up quickly to support troops under Brig. Gen. Howell Cobb, forced back from Crampton's Gap by a Federal offensive. His promptness helped keep the Union advance from its objective, Harpers Ferry. He was awarded a brigadier general's star six weeks later. Afterward, Cumming went west: first to Mobile, then in April 1863 to Mississippi as a subordinate to Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton. He led a brigade in Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson's division at Champion's Hill and in the actions outside Vicksburg. Captured and paroled with the city's garrison, he reorganized Stevenson's old brigade at Decatur, Georgia, in the fall of 1863 and led it gallantly at Missionary Ridge. He was conspicuous in many actions during the Atlanta Campaign, winning praise for several successful and unsuccessful attacks. At Jonesboro, he was disabled by another wound. Postbellum In postwar years, he farmed in Floyd County, Georgia before moving to Rome, Georgia, and then to his native city. He pursued a minor public career, including service on the American Military Commission to Korea in 1888. Cumming died in Rome, Georgia, and was buried in Summerville Cemetery.

The route opened to rail traffic in March 2008. Line under construction, looking towards Alloa  Background  Under Scottish Executive funding and to relieve congestion on the Forth Bridge, the line between Stirling and Alloa has been reopened to passenger traffic. Construction work started in 2005, with track laying commencing at the end of September 2006 and ending in March 2007. In addition, the route required new signalling, level crossings and a new Alloa railway station. Work was finished at the end of March 2008 and the line re-opened to the public on 19 May 2008, preceded by a series of pre-opening charters on 15 May 2008. The line between Alloa and Kincardine has also been rebuilt to allow coal trains from Hunterston Terminal, for example, to Longannet Power Station to avoid using the Forth Bridge.  History of the route  The line uses the formation of the former main line Stirling and Dunfermline Railway between Stirling and Alloa, and that of the Kincardine Line between Alloa and Dunfermline along the north shore of the River Forth past Longannet Power Station.  Construction  Much of the remaining track was still in place, but in very poor condition, and some sections had been removed, particularly at Kilbagie and near Blackgrange level crossing, so track laying was accomplished by conventional construction machinery such as bulldozers and excavators, rather than the rail-based equipment normally used for routine track replacement. Rail arrived by road in 60 foot lengths, was dragged from the nearest access point to its final position, and was then joined into continuous lengths by a mobile flash butt welding machine. This is a slow process compared to normal track renewal. In addition to the track, the ballast was also renewed, and beneath that, waterproofing and soil reinforcing membranes were used. A great deal of new drainage was provided. One major bridge, over the A907 at Helensfield, was completely renewed, with one new abutment to allow the road to be widened. Everything else was fully refurbished, and the steelwork of most of the bridges is now painted a distinctive maroon colour.Alloa station, with the freight line to Kincardine on the left The line as built is a single track, with passing loops at Cambus, to the west of Alloa, and Hilton, to the east. The new eastern bypass road passes over the Hilton loop on a bridge. The Cambus loop is to the east of the road into the village, while the original Cambus station was to the west. The passenger terminus at Alloa has a single terminal platform. The original loop at Kincardine has been removed and, to obtain a better alignment, the junction for the former power station sidings has been moved to the east, with a new locomotive run-round facility in the yard. The yard was used for supplies of track materials, ballast etc., but is also used as a coal loading point, so that coal from open-cast workings to the north can be transported by rail to Longannet, without passing through the village of Kincardine. It was also used in conjunction with the construction of the adjacent Clackmannanshire Bridge across the River Forth. Most of the level crossings on the route have been abolished. However several have been retained, where alternative access would be difficult and expensive to provide.  Route and potential alternatives  A deviation to the north to avoid the villages of Clackmannan and Kincardine was rejected as it would have cost many times as much as reopening the existing route. It would have used part of the former Alloa to Dunfermline main line, currently used as a cycle track and footpath, but would have required a tunnel in unknown and possibly problematic conditions in order to reach Longannet, and would have removed the possibility of providing stations at either Clackmannan or Kincardine in the future.  Reopening  The line was formally reopened on Thursday 15 May 2008. A train headed by Gresley K4 No. 61994 The Great Marquess, made four round trips from Alloa to Stirling, the first for VIPs, and the next three for paying passengers. All were fully loaded. As there are no run-around facilities for locomotives at Alloa, the return journeys were headed by a preserved Class 55 Deltic diesel electric locomotive, which remained attached to the Alloa end of the train throughout. The line opened to regular passengers with the first timetabled train to Glasgow on Monday 19 May 2008.  Usage  According to the Scottish Parliament, the usage was predicted to be 155,000 passengers per year, but part way through the first year this was revised upwards to 416,000, vastly exceeding the target.  Future expansion  The retention of the coastal route offers the possibility of providing passenger services to Dunfermline via Clackmannan, Kincardine, Culross, Valleyfield and Cairneyhill. The former direct main line from Alloa to Dunfermline (which was not proposed for closure by Dr. Beeching) is now partly obstructed by developments on the site of the old Dunfermline Upper station. There would appear to be no prospect of access to the existing Dunfermline Town (formerly Dunfermline Lower) station by this route, unless a new stretch of line were built west of Dunfermline. However, the coastal Kincardine line does give direct access to Dunfermline Town. Opening the line to passenger services was adopted by the Scottish National Party in their 2016 manifesto after a petition by Cairneyhill resident Martin Keatings to the Scottish Parliament Petitions Committee in 2015 which gained cross-party support from all 5 of the major parties at Holyrood. The line from Alloa to Dunfermline has been identified by Campaign for a Better Transport as a priority 1 candidate for reopening. There has been some discussion of the possibility of providing a service to Rosyth Ferry Terminal.  Driver training and commissioning  On 25 March 2008, the line became fully operational after signalling works over the Easter weekend to tie in the line to the existing network. On 31 March 2008, driver training began on the line to familiarise drivers with the route. In late April 2008, much of the coal freight heading for Longannet was transferred from the Edinburgh-Glasgow line via the Forth Bridge to the new railway.

These plants are known as rein orchids. They are native to western North America, especially California and the Pacific Northwest. This genus has the following characteristics: (a) a bisexual perennial nongreen plant that grows from buried tubers; fruit capsule bearing numerous minute seeds; (c) pollen that is sticky, and which is removed as sessile anther sacs; and (d) stigma fused with its style into a column. There are a total of ten species in the genus Piperia, which is named for American botanist Charles V. Piper. The genus members manifest generally cylindrical spikes or racemes. The subsurface architecture of these terrestrial wild orchids consists of a rhizome structure, from which emanate tubers. The rhizome extracts nutrients from fungal intermediates and may also store some of these nutrients. A basal rosette of leaves develops from the tuber at the surface of the soil, each of the two or three leaves being lanceolate in shape.Morgan & Ackerman, Lindleyana 5:205‚Äì211 (1990) Each leaf ranges from 10 to 15 centimeters in length and 20 to 35 millimeters in width.

It also works to create centers of pediatric cardiac competence in these countries, so these children can be treated at home. SACH was founded in 1996 and is based at the Edith Wolfson Medical Center near Tel Aviv, Israel. Mission The SACH mission is achieved in three ways: * Providing life-saving cardiac surgery and other life-saving procedures for children from developing countries at the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, Israel, near Tel Aviv; * Providing an in-depth outreach post- graduate training program for medical personnel from these developing countries in Israel. They have trained doctors from Etheiopia, Tanzania and the Palestinian Authority to become pediatric cardiologists.; * Sending staff overseas to provide this education to local medical professionals, as well as to perform surgeries side-by-side with them. They have sent numerous medical missions every year to many countries including Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zanzabar and Romania. As of April 2019, SACH has brought more than 5,000Sanusey, 4, is 4,000th helped by Save a Child‚Äôs Heart children to Israel from 59 countries including Ethiopia, Gambia, Vietnam, Jordan, Moldova, Tanzania, Russia, the Philippines, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Angola Iraq, Haiti, St. Vincent, Trinidad, Ecuador, Mauritania, Senegal, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Congo, Zimbabwe, Zanzibar, Rwanda, Somalia, Eritrea, Sri Lanka, China, Kazakhstan, Romania, Ukraine, and Syria,Sidner, Sara (May 30, 2013).

Approximately 50% of the children are from the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Iraq and Morocco, more than 30% are from Africa, and the remainder are from Asia, Eastern Europe and the Americas. In December 2010 the first child from Indonesia was brought to Israel by SACH and underwent successful surgery in January 2011. Medical personnel who have trained with SACH in Israel have come from China, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Moldova, Nigeria, Vietnam and Zanzibar, as well as from the Palestinian Authority. SACH has instructed hundreds of physicians and nurses during over 60 medical missions to China, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Jordan, Mauritania, Moldova, Nigeria, Russia, Ukraine, Tanzania, Romania, Vietnam and Zanzibar. SACH's doctors and medical personnel completely volunteer their time and services for this project, with the only costs (about $10,000 US) used to provide post-surgical care at SACH's Children's Home in Israel for an average stay of about three months. Children are brought to Israel from their home country in groups of four to six, accompanied by a nurse or, if they are under age three, by a family member. Save a Child's Heart Foundation U.S. has been certified by Independent Charities of America as one of about 2,000 ‚ÄúBest in America‚Äù charities, verification that its ‚Äúfund-raising materials and other information to the public is truthful and non-deceptive‚Äù and that it provides ‚Äúdocumented provision of substantive services.‚Äù Save a Child's Heart Foundation U.S. has received the Independent Charities Seal of Excellence, awarded to the members of Independent Charities of America and Local Independent Charities of America that have, upon rigorous independent review, been able to certify, document, and demonstrate, on an annual basis, that they meet the highest standards of public accountability, program effectiveness, and cost effectiveness. These standards include those required by the U.S. Government for inclusion in the Combined Federal Campaign. Of the 1,000,000 charities operating in the United States today, it is estimated that fewer than 50,000, or 5 percent, meet or exceed these standards, and, of those, fewer than 2,000 have been awarded this Seal. In 2018, Save a Child's Heart was honored with the UN Population Award, in recognition of its outstanding contributions to population and health. History Save a Child's Heart is the creation of Dr. Amram Cohen, and grew out of Cohen's experiences as a doctor serving with the U.S. Armed Forces in Korea in 1988, where he joined a program that helped poor local children with heart disease. The experience introduced him to a network of doctors doing similar work in developing countries, inspiring him to start his own program after moving to Israel in 1992. He brought three Ethiopian children to Israel for heart surgery in 1996, and then went on to make use of a network of professional and personal contacts to build a volunteer organization to help others for whom the operations were unavailable or too expensive. Through a foundation he established, Save a Child's Heart, Dr. Cohen and other surgeons conducted hundreds of operations on children with congenital heart diseases, mostly at the Wolfson Medical Center, where Dr. Cohen was the head of pediatric cardiac surgery and served as Save a Child's Heart's chief surgeon. Children were also brought from Nigeria, Tanzania, Congo, Moldova, Russia, Ghana, Vietnam, Ecuador, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. Dr. Cohen and his team also traveled to China and Ethiopia to operate on about 60 children and taught medical staff there and in other countries. His foundation helped bring doctors and nurses to Israel for training, with the aim of creating centers for treatment of pediatric heart disease in their home countries. Dr. Cohen died on August 16, 2001, while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. He was 47. Since Dr. Cohen's death, SACH has continued its efforts to benefit children with life-threatening cardiac problems and to teach medical personnel in developing nations the surgical techniques needed to treat these young patients. In 2006, SACH was selected as a featured charity by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Air Cares program, with the airline showing a video of the charity's work on board its flights. The airline also donated EUR10,000 and donated free air miles to SACH. In April, 2007, Israeli musician Idan Raichel traveled with Save a Child's Heart to Rwanda and Ethiopia. In May 2011, SACH received recognition for special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations In November 2011, a new children's home was inaugurated. The facility was built specifically to meet the needs of the young patients and staff and will allow Save a Child's Heart to house and treat a larger number of the children.(10/11/11).

Two of the creations are extant as of 2019. The Stonhouse Baronetcy, of Radley in the County of Berkshire, was created in the Baronetage of England on 7 May 1628 (#253) for William Stonhouse. He was the eldest son of George Stonhouse (died 1573), sometime Clerk of the Green Cloth. The second Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Abingdon. The third Baronet also represented Abingdon in the House of Commons. He disinherited his eldest son, George, and attempted to eliminate him from succession to the baronetcy. In 1670 he surrendered his patent and on 5 May 1670 he obtained a new patent (with the same territorial designation), with remainder to his two younger sons, and with the precedency of the original creation. However, upon the third Baronet's death, his eldest son successfully claimed the original baronetcy, while his younger brother John succeeded in the baronetcy created by the new patent. The line of the fourth Baronet failed on the death of the sixth Baronet in 1740 and the baronetcy passed to the fourth Baronet of the 1670 creation. The second and third Baronets of this creation had represented Abingdon and Berkshire respectively in the House of Commons. The eleventh Baronet was a physician, Anglican clergyman and preacher. The Stonhouse Baronetcy, of Amberden Hall, Debden in the County of Essex, was created in the Baronetage of England on 11 June 1641 (#303) for James Stonhouse. He was the son of Sir James Stonhouse Kt. (youngest son of the aforementioned George Stonhouse) and the nephew of the first Baronet of the 1628 creation.

They are often eaten at the end of a meal and are said to aid in digestion. The lactobacillus in nukazuke pickles may be a beneficial supplement to the intestinal flora. Since nukazuke absorb nutrients from the rice bran, they are high in vitamin B1, which helped prevent beri-beri in 17th century Edo (present-day Tokyo). Almost any edible vegetable may be preserved using this technique. Traditional varieties include eggplant, Japanese radish (daikon), cabbage, and cucumber. The taste of nukazuke can vary from pleasantly tangy to very sour, salty and pungent, depending on the methods and recipe used or region. Usually they have a crispy crunchy texture. Less common are fish nukazuke, found in the north part of Japan, using sardine, mackerel or Japanese horse mackerel. Wooden Japanese cedar tubes have been traditionally used for the fermentation; nowadays ceramic or plastic containers are also used. Preparation Rice bran is first mixed in a crock with salt, kombu seaweed, and water. Some recipes call for ginger, miso, beer or wine. The resultant mash, called nukamiso or nukadoko, has a consistency comparable to wet sand or cooked grits. Vegetables, apple peels, or persimmon peels are added to the nuka-bed every day for at least a few days until a fermenting culture has been established. At this point nuka-bed is ‚Äòlive,‚Äô meaning that it contains a culture of active single-celled organisms, mostly lactobacilli and yeast. Although nukazuke can be made from scratch, a bit of well seasoned nuka from an older batch is often used to ‚Äòseed‚Äô a fresh batch. Unless an established nuka sample is used to seed a fresh batch, the ubiquitous lactic acid-producing colonies crucial to the fermentation process must come from sources such as the skin of the starter vegetables or from human hands. Once the fermenting cultures have been established the nuka-bed usually develops a complex unique aroma that may be described as anything from \\"yeasty\\" to \\"earthy\\". At this point the starter vegetables are discarded and pickling vegetables are buried in the bed for as little as a few hours to as long as several months for very strong flavor. Some sources recommend a maximum pickling time of one month. Others suggest that pickles can be left for years in a well-kept nuka-bed. Unpleasant smells such as a \\"sour\\" or \\"stinky\\" aroma may indicate a problem with the nuka-bed. Because the process depends on colonies of live organisms, flavors and smells can vary considerably from day to day and the fermenting process slows in colder weather. When ready, nukazuke pickles are removed from the bed, washed in cool clean water, sliced and served as a side to savory meals. The nuka-bed must be stirred well daily to keep it from becoming putrescent, moldy or infested with vermin. The acidity, salt content and oxygenation provided by daily stirring keeps toxic microbes from growing in the bed. It is universally recommended that this daily stirring be done with clean bare hands. Depending on the size of the container used, the nuka-bed could be stored temporarily in the fridge for up to two weeks, when daily stirring is not possible. Sometimes weights made of metal, stone or jugs of water are used the keep the nuka-bed under pressure, drawing water from the vegetables and speeding fermentation. Nuka-beds are known to acquire subtle flavors from the surrounding environment and thus should not be stored in musty areas. Additional amounts of rice bran and salt are added from time to time, and some recommend discarding portions of the old nuka to make way for the new. Water is usually provided by the vegetables buried in the bed. With proper maintenance nuka-beds can be kept indefinitely and are often passed down from generation to generation. Old nuka-beds are valued for their nuanced flavor. Takuan (pickled daikon) is also one variation of nukazuke.Traditional takuan uses sun-dried daikon, however, mass production takuan are often prepared with sugar to cut pickling time. Ginger, beer, orange seeds, persimmon peels or apple peels can be added to the nuka-bed for flavor. Dried chili-peppers and/or fresh garlic are often added either for flavor, to keep the bed from becoming wormy, or to keep fermentation in check. When rice bran cannot be found, alternatives such as wheat bran or even cornflakes have been reported to work well. See also * * References * Katz, Sandor Ellix.

The album became a gold record in Brazil. It is the second Tit√£s album produced by Jack Endino.  Context and production  Domingo came after a period of solo projects by most of the band's members. Vocalists Branco Mello and S√©rgio Britto (the latter also being the keyboardist) had released Con el Mundo a Mis Pies under their project Kleiderman; the also vocalists Paulo Miklos and Nando Reis (the latter also being the bassist) had experienced their solo debuts (Paulo Miklos and 12 de Janeiro, respectively) and guitarist Tony Bellotto had published his first book, Bellini e a Esfinge. The solo releases were of different styles and exposed the fact that Tit√£s was formed by different minds and ideas. The band itself admits the albums always ended up leaving a member disappointed. Bellotto didn't felt represented by the electronic elements of √ï Bl√©sq Blom. Reis only sang in one song of each of the two next albums (Tudo Ao Mesmo Tempo Agora and Titanomaquia). The solo efforts did not sell well and Bellotto stated in a 1997 interview that, if any of them experienced a commercial breakthrough, they would hardly go back to the band, which didn't perform well on the radio at that time. Even returning from periods in which they could make their own decisions, the seven members gathered to try and create their eight Tit√£s album. By the time of the album's release, Bellotto described it as \\"a more opened and varied album, with a bigger diversity of musical textures, more happy and relaxed\\". He also said the album came to prove the band was still alive, since the press allegedly considered the band to be over following so many solo efforts. Reis established comparisons between this album and its predecessor Titanomaquia, which, according to him, \\"is a shadowier album. The new album is shinier, has more color, is more rhythmically diversified. Like a Sunday after a dark Saturday night\\". The band also considers its diversity to reflect the musical heterogeneity within the group. Jack Endino considered Domingo as his favorite Tit√£s album. About the creation of it, he commented: It was pre-produced at Nota Por Nota Studios in S√£o Paulo, between April and August 1995; then recorded at Be Bop Sound Studios, also in S√£o Paulo, in September of the same year; mixed at Hanzek Audio, in Seattle in October of the same year and mastered at Starling Sound, in New York City, in the same month. The album's promotional tour started on 22 December 1995 at the Gin√°sio do Ibirapuera in S√£o Paulo. In 1996, it was re-released with some bonus tracks, including remixed versions of \\"Eu N√£o Vou Dizer Nada (Al√©m do que Estou Dizendo)\\" and \\"Tudo o que Voc√™ Quiser\\" and a new song: \\"Pela Paz\\", composed as the theme song for the campaign \\"Caminhada 89 pela Paz\\" (89 Walk for Peace), by radio 89 FM.

Formed in 1991, the original line-up consisted of Neil Ash, Simon Manning, and Simon Treen. Biography Formed in August 1991 and taking their name from a song by the band The March Violets, Children on Stun appeared to enjoy a relatively large amount of success in a short period of time. Treen left within a year of the band forming. The band's first gig took place at a club called \\"The Crypt\\" in Hastings. In the same year, the band also recorded their first demo, entitled \\"Elegance\\", and also made an appearance in Mick Mercer's second book on the gothic rock genre: this boosted the band's popularity and gained them publicity. In 1992, the band supported the popular goth rock band Rosetta Stone on their UK tour. Later on that year, they released their second demo, \\"Choices\\". The band went on to release two more demos in 1993, entitled \\"Monochrome I\\" and \\"Monochrome II\\". They used the profits from these demos to release their first single, \\"Hollow\\", which became a club hit throughout Europe and the UK. The band secured a record contract with Cleopatra Records in 1994 and released the album Tourniquets of Love's Desire. This album was well received within the UK goth scene and boosted the band's popularity. \\"Towards the end of the year, the band was approached by the label M&A; and asked to produce an EP. This resulted in the Overland EP being released.\\" Kyle Whipp (formerly of Soul Inside) joined the band in 1995 as their new bass player with Manning moving to guitar. The band's first gig featuring Whipp took place at London's Camden Underworld. The EP Celebration Drug was released later on in the year and included the popular track \\"Whiskey a-go-go\\". In August of the same year, the band went on a tour of Scandinavia. As well as this, the band released another EP titled Celibacy and Anadin which included remixes by Rosetta Stone. After the release of this EP, the band ended their contract with Cleopatra. In 1996, the band began to record their new album, Mondo Weird, which was not released until 1997. The band also released the single \\"Pin ups, Soap Operas and Natural Disasters\\" in this year. A remix LP called Outrageous, Outlawed, Outspoken was released by M&A; in 1998: during the same year, the band announced that they would be splitting up. They played their final gig at the Camden Underworld on 24 May 1998. Resurrection Records also released a CD of this gig, entitled Seven Year Itch. In 2005, M&A; released a compilation called Rough Trade on a Cheap Promotion, featuring the band's b-sides, alternate song versions and demos. On 15 May 2015, Children on Stun played a sell-out reunion gig at the o2 Academy2 in Islington, London and within a few weeks announced they would be reforming. On 4 July 2015, Simon Manning died in his sleep from a heart attack. On 24 October the Stun had a charity fundraising birthday party in memory of Manning. They were joined by his long term bandmate and friend Stuart Harper [Felo-De-Se] who stood in his place. Also paying tribute were Vendemmian, whom Manning had joined for a short time and The Last Cry a favourite band of Manning's, giving their services for free. The money raised was split between the British Heart Foundation and the Sophie Lancaster Foundation. Dancing with Mr Punch a strictly limited edition CD of 100 copies, compiled by John D'Anter, containing all four early studio demos on CD was made available to attendees of the birthday memorial gig with the proceeds also going to charity. The band decide to continue with Stuart Harper joining permanently on guitar. On 22 October 2016, a second charity event [The Birthday Bash 2] was organized in their hometown of Hastings in memory of Manning. That same night a limited edition CD, This Sideshow Burlesque was released first to all attendees. Only 100 hand-numbered copies were pressed with all profits from the release going to two heart charities. The track-list contained rare live tracks from the band's early career. In 2017, after headlining the Gotham Sounds Festival in Germany and during the recording of new material, the band announced they would be splitting up again. The following year, the group made a surprise return at the Hope & Anchor in Islington, London on 4 May. The band recorded two new songs \\"All the Pain of Love\\" and \\"Echoes\\" at Savage Sounds Studio, Hastings, as part of a planned Mini-LP. In June 2018, Harper left the band and, in September 2018, Ex-Dream Disciples guitarist Gordon Young joined the group. In December that year, Children on Stun sign to Armalyte Industries. In March 2019, Echoes a five track EP of new material was released with Gordon Young producing. The track \\"Another Love, Another Beginning\\" was originally written by Whipp/Ash as part of a planned but unrecorded, second Stripper Project album. After the original split Manning formed Spares in 1999 with Alison Gann. Whipp and Ash formed The Stripper Project with Hannah Neech in 2007. 2008 saw the release of an official DVD entitled Bootleg Television, comprising three hours of archive footage from the band's personal archives, compiled by filmmaker D/Evil. Included is the band's final concert in Camden, a 45-minute rockumentary of the 'Mondo Tour', three unreleased tracks with unseen footage, a stills gallery, a rare Norwegian television interview, three songs from the band's Scandinavian tour plus a remastered copy of the rarely seen Celebration video. Only 100 are made and marked \\"limited edition\\" and signed by the band. Manning joined Grooving in Green in 2009. Spares Since its incarnation, Simon Manning and Alison Gann released several albums and EPs, and been joined by various musicians, including Jamie Smith (Libitina) and Kyle Whipp (Children on Stun/Stripper Project). =Discography= *Tired & Bizarre CD album, 2000, M&A; Music Art *End of the Line EP, 2001, M&A; Music Art *Download CD, 2003, Black Planet *Suffering Fools Gladly CD, 2004, Black Planet *Half Light Zone CD, 2006, Signet Records *After-Life three track EP (internet only release, 2008) *Beautiful Liar, 2009 The Stripper Project Whipp and Ash formed The Stripper Project with Hannah Neech in late 2007.

Justice Koontz has served at every level of court (district, circuit, Court of Appeals, and Supreme Court) in the Virginia judicial system. 2018 will mark Justice Koontz's 50th year of service as a jurist in Virginia. Prior to being made a Supreme Court Justice, Justice Koontz was an original member of the Virginia Court of Appeals, serving as its second Chief Judge for two four year terms following the death of Chief Judge E. Ballard Baker a few months after the Court was created. Prior to his appointment to the Court of Appeals, Justice Koontz served as a judge of the 23rd Judicial Circuit of Virginia and the Roanoke Juvenile Court. He attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University where he received a B.S. in Biology and was a member of the Corps of Cadets. He received his law degree from University of Richmond School of Law. Among Justice Koontz's more controversial opinions was Arlington County v. White, in which the Court determined that a local government could not extend employee health benefits to non-related persons living with the employee, including same-sex partners. Writing for the majority, Justice Koontz applied the \\"Dillon Rule\\" that prohibits local governments in Virginia from going beyond the authority delegated to them by the state government. As expressed in a concurring opinion by Justice Cynthia D. Kinser, the majority declined to address whether the County's action was an attempt to recognize same-sex marriage, as was argued in a separate concurring opinion written by Justice Leroy Rountree Hassell Sr., who was joined by two other justices. Despite the legal justification of the majority for striking down the policy, the opinion is nonetheless viewed as controversial in the Gay and Lesbian Community. Justice Koontz also authored one of the two dissents in the Supreme Court of Virginia's opinion in Atkins v. Commonwealth. When the case was subsequently reversed by the United States Supreme Court, the majority opinion in that Court quoted from Justice Koontz's dissent, along with the dissent by Justice Hassell. Specifically, the Court cited Justice Koontz's observation that \\"it is indefensible to conclude that individuals who are mentally retarded are not to some degree less culpable for their criminal acts. By definition, such individuals have substantial limitations not shared by the general population. A moral and civilized society diminishes itself if its system of justice does not afford recognition and consideration of those limitations in a meaningful way.\\" In a more recent dissent in the death penalty case of Porter v. Commonwealth, Justice Koontz, responding to the majority's use of procedural default to excuse the trial court's gross abuse of power in presiding over the trial in a different jurisdiction without a proper order of designation, observed that \\"[i]f the courts empowered to sit in judgment over those accused of typically heinous crimes fail to take the greatest care in assuring the fairness of the proceedings that result in the imposition of the death penalty, then it must inevitably follow in time that the death penalty statutes of this Commonwealth will no longer pass constitutional muster.\\" This statement was widely quoted in the media and reflects Justice Koontz's growing frustration with the manner in which the death penalty is administered in Virginia. Justice Koontz's collected opinions have been published in a seven volume set with the final volume being released in July 2017. External links *Opinion in Porter v.

This led in part to an elected European Parliament being created in 1979 and given the power to approve or reject EU legislation. Since then, usage of the term has broadened to describe newer issues facing the European Union. Voter turnout at Elections to the European Parliament fell consecutively at every election from the first in 1979 up to 2014, when it hit a low of 42.54% before finally rising in 2019. The 2014 turnout figure is lower than that of any national election in the 27 countries of the European Union, where turnout at national elections averages 68% across the EU. Opinions differ as to whether the EU has a democratic deficit or how it should be remedied if it exists. Pro-Europeans (i.e. those in favour of the EU) argue that the European Union should reform its institutions to make them more accountable, while Eurosceptics argue that the EU should reduce its powers and often campaign for withdrawal from the EU. Use and meaning of the term The phrase \\"democratic deficit\\" is cited as having first been used in 1977 by the Young European Federalists in their Manifesto,first use of the term ‚Äúdemocratic deficit‚Äù BY RICHARD ‚Äì 10/10/1977 POSTED IN: ARCHIVES Political Union. which was drafted by Richard Corbett. In 1979 it was used by David Marquand in reference to the then European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union. He argued that the European Parliament (then the Assembly) suffered from a democratic deficit as it was not directly elected by the citizens of the Community. 'Democratic deficit', in relation to the European Union, refers to a perceived lack of accessibility to the ordinary citizen, or lack of representation of the ordinary citizen, and lack of accountability of European Union institutions. =Constitutional nature of the democratic deficit= In the European Union, there are two sources of democratic legitimacy: the European Parliament, chosen by the electorates of the individual EU countries; and the Council of the European Union (the \\"Council of Ministers\\"), together with the European Council (of heads of national governments), that represent the peoples of the individual states. The European Commission (the executive branch of the Union) is appointed by the two bodies acting together. Democratic legitimacy within the EU can be compared with the dual legitimacy provided for in a federal polity, such as the USA, where there are two independent sources of democratic legitimacy, the House of Representatives and the Senate, and, to become law, decisions must be approved both by one institution representing the people as a whole and by a separate body representing the peoples of the individual states. The German Constitutional Court referred to a \\"structural democratic deficit\\" inherent in the construction of the European Union. It found that the decision-making processes in the EU remained largely those of an international organisation, which would ordinarily be based on the principle of the equality of states and that the principle of equality of states and the principle of equality of citizens cannot be reconciled in a Staatenverbund. In other words, in a supranational union or confederation (which is not a federal state) there is a problem of how to reconcile the principle of equality among nation states, which applies to international (intergovernmental) organisations, and the principle of equality among citizens, which applies within states. A 2014 report from the British Electoral Reform Society wrote that \\"[t]his unique institutional structure makes it difficult to apply the usual democratic standards without significant changes of emphasis. Certainly, the principles of representativeness, accountability and democratic engagement are vital, but the protection of the rights of minorities is perhaps especially important. The EU is a political regime that is, in one sense at least, entirely made up of minorities.\\" =European Commission= One assertion of democratic illegitimacy focuses on the role of the European Commission in initiating legislation. This criticism has, in turn, been criticised, using comparisons with the situation in national governments where few MP's bills are ever debated and \\"fewer than 15% are ever successfully adopted in any form\\", while government proposals \\"generally pass without substantial or substantive amendments from the legislature\\". The Commission is reestablished every five years. Individual members of the incoming Commission are nominated by national governments and the proposed Commission is (or is not) approved jointly and severally by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. If Parliament passes a vote of censure, the Commission must resign. Such a censure motion has been brought eight times, but never passed. In 1999, an initial censure motion against the Santer Commission was defeated, awaiting the results of an investigation. When the results of the investigation were published, the Santer Commission resigned, forestalling a second censure motion that was expected to pass with a large majority. In an attempt to strengthen democratic legitimacy, the Treaty of Lisbon provided that the nomination of the President of the European Commission should \\"take account\\" of the result of the European parliamentary elections, interpreted by the larger parliamentary groups to mean that the European Council should nominate the candidate (Spitzenkandidat) proposed by the dominant parliamentary group. However, this has also been criticized from the point of view of democratic legitimacy on the grounds that the European Union is not a country and the European Commission is not a government, also having a semi-judicial role that requires it to act as a \\"referee\\" or \\"policeman\\" rather than a partisan actor. The fear is that a \\"semi-elected\\" Commission president might be \\"too partisan to retain the trust of national leaders; too powerless to win the loyalty of citizens\\". This, too, is seen as a possibly insoluble problem resulting from the European Union's dual nature, partly an international organization and partly a federation. The Electoral Reform Society observed polling evidence from Germany which showed that support for the CDU/CSU (EPP group) ahead of the 2014 European Parliament elections was higher than support for the Social Democrats (S&D; group) and that there was little difference between their support in the opinion polls for national and European Parliament elections. This was despite another poll showing that S&D; candidate Martin Schulz was more popular among German voters than EPP candidate Jean-Claude Juncker. They concluded that \\"this does not suggest that the majority of German voters are treating the contest as a chance to choose a Commission President.\\" However, they recommended that the candidate model be kept with \\"a clearer set of rules for future elections.\\" =European Parliament= The main assertion of democratic illegitimacy focuses on the European Parliament lacking the power to determine the direction of EU Law, with the European Commission being \\"the only institution empowered to initiate legislation\\" and having a \\"near monopoly on legislative initiative\\" according to EU sources. However this is not unusual - in most Parliamentary systems the executive has a \\"near monopoly on legislative initiative\\". In Westminster, for example, the only available channel for MPs to initiate legislation is through the Private Members Bill (which is easily defeated through being deprived of time, so is only suitable for minor or uncontroversial bills, though was occasionally used by the government in the 1960s as a mechanism for cross-party legislation. See Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom). Article 225, created in the Lisbon Treaty, sought to put an end to this controversy by giving Parliament a means to request proposals to the Commission, but this puts no obligation on the Commission and is legally non-binding, with the Commission only needing to \\"inform the European Parliament of the reasons\\" for rejecting a legislative proposal. Criticism of this alleged deficit has been countered by a number of political scientists, who have compared the systems of governance in the European Union with that of the United States, and stated that the alleged powerless or dysfunctional nature of the European Parliament is now a \\"myth\\". It is argued that there are important differences from national European parliaments, such as the role of committees, bipartisan voting, decentralized political parties, executive-legislative divide and absence of Government-opposition divide. All these traits are considered as signs of weakness or unaccountability, but as these very same traits are found in the US House of Representatives to a lesser or greater degree, the European Parliament is more appropriately compared with the US House of Representatives. In that sense, it is now a powerful parliament, as it is not controlled by a \\"governing majority\\": Majorities have to be built afresh for each item of legislation by explanation, persuasion and negotiation. Legislative initiative in the EU rests almost entirely with the Commission, while in member states it is shared between parliament and executive. However, in national parliaments less than 15% of legislative initiatives from individual members of parliament become law in any form when they do not have the backing of the executive, while most proposals by the executive are passed without major amendments in parliament. The European Parliament, on the other hand, can only propose amendments, but these proposals are successful in more than 80% of cases, and even in controversial proposals, the success rate is almost 30%. In 2003, Liberal Democrat (ALDE) MEP Chris Davies said he had far more influence as a member of the European Parliament than he did as an opposition MP in the House of Commons. \\"Here I started to have an impact on day one\\", \\"And there has not been a month since when words I tabled did not end up in legislation.\\" European elections The low turnout at European elections has been cited as weakening the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament: the BBC commented that in Britain many more votes were cast in an election on the reality show Big Brother than in the 1999 European Parliament election. On the other hand, the President of the European Parliament [the 'Speaker'] compared the turnout for the European Parliament to the presidential elections in the United States: In fact, the figures that are compared, the European Parliament voter turnout from 1999 (49.51%) and the US presidential voter turnout from 1996 (49%)Voter turnout in the United States presidential elections are only marginally different, and the US voter turnout for 1996 was the lowest turnout in the US since 1924 (when it was 48.9%). The turnout in European elections proceeded to decline in every subsequent election up to 2014, when it reached a low of 42.54%. In 2019, over 50 percent of EU citizens voted in the European Parliamentary Elections, the highest voter turnout since 1994. According to Matej Avbelj (Director of the Law Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia), the EU democratic deficit can be viewed as having a formal component (which is likely to be remedied) but also a social component resulting from people's low acceptance of the EU, as evidenced by low voter turnout. Legal commentators such as Schmidt and Follesdal argue that the European Union lacks politics that individual citizens understand. This flows from the lack of knowledge of political parties and is reinforced by the lack of votes at European Union elections. =Council of the European Union= Voting in the Council (of relevant Ministers) is usually by qualified majority voting, and sometimes unanimity is required. This means that, for the vast majority of EU legislation, the corresponding national government has usually voted in favour in the Council. To give an example, up to September 2006, out of the 86 pieces of legislation adopted in that year the Government of the United Kingdom had voted in favour of the legislation 84 times, abstained from voting twice and never voted against. Development of democratic legitimacy and transparency Over time, a number of constitutional changes have been introduced that have aimed to increase democratic legitimacy: *The Maastricht Treaty introduced **the status of EU citizenship, granting EU citizens the right to vote and stand in elections to the European Parliament and municipal elections in their country of residence, irrespective of their nationality (subject to age and residency qualifications). **the legislative procedure known as the \\"co-decision procedure\\", giving the directly elected European Parliament the right of \\"co-deciding\\" legislation on an equal footing with the Council of the European Union. *The Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009 introduced **a separate treaty title confirming that the functioning of the EU shall be founded on representative democracy and giving EU citizens both direct representation through the European Parliament and indirect representation via national governments through the Council of the European Union **the establishment of the co-decision procedure as the standard (\\"ordinary\\") legislative procedure **a significant increase in the powers of the European Parliament **the right of any EU citizen or resident to petition the European Parliament \\"on any matter which comes within the Union's field of activity and which affects him, her, or it directly\\".[Article 227 TFEU]. **making meetings of the Council public when there is a general debate and when a proposal for a legislative act is voted on. These debates can be viewedvideo.consilium.europa.eu in real time on the Internet. **enhancing the role of national parliaments in EU legislation. **giving full legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which was solemnly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission in the year 2000. According to a 2019 study, the empowerment of the EP does not always lead to more public support, and \\"further enhancement of public support can be achieved only in the institutional dimension involving proposal power\\".

Close-up of flowering spike of Barbed Goatgrass Aegilops triuncialis occurring along roadsides at the base of the Carson Range, Nevada Aegilops triuncialis, or barbed goatgrass, is a winter annual grass species of the family Poaceae. It is native to many areas in Eastern and Mediterranean Europe and Western Asia. It is considered an introduced, invasive species in North America, mainly in the Western coast of the United States. In its native lands, the grass thrives in mainly rocky, serpentine soil, but also does well in grasslands and ruderal/disturbed ground as well as oak woodlands. Description Barbed goatgrass grows to be about 8 to 16 inches tall with few to many rigid, loosely erect aerial stems (culms). In late spring the plant produces rigid flower spikes consisting of three to six spikelets bearing long, stiff awns which assist in seed distribution. When the grass matures, the spikelets fall off in their entirety to germinate on the ground, and the long awns which give the plant its name assist in dispersal by animals, wind or water. As an invasive species Barbed goatgrass was introduced to North America in the 20th century from Mediterranean Europe and Western Asia. It has been found in California, Oregon, Nevada, and the New England area, but with the greatest impact in California. Barbed goatgrass was introduced to the California area with the trade of Mexican cattle in the early 20th century. The plant's unusual ability to invade nutrient-depleted, infertile soils means that it can severely damage habitats which often serve as important refugia for endemic grassland species which most other invading grasses are unable to exploit. Barbed goatgrass is a fast-growing, rapidly spreading invasive species mainly in grasslands, pastures, and ranches. It is listed as a noxious weed by California Department of Food and Agriculture. Because of its fast, invasive growing patterns, barbed goatgrass creates a monoculture, killing the other plants in its area. The invasive nature of barbed goatgrass is causing a decrease in species diversity, and a decrease in forage. Most grazing animals tend to avoid barbed goatgrass because they do not like the taste of it, allowing the grass to take over the other grasses and grains consumed by the animals. The barbs on the flower spikelets containing the seeds become attached easily to animal fur, human clothing, and vehicles which allows the seeds to become more widely dispersed over the area. Control methods The most important component in the control of barbed goatgrass is early detection. When found in small isolated areas, it can be taken care of more effectively. A recently developed method of assessing greenness in aerial color infra-red (CIR) imagery using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values to differentiate between these invasive weedy grasses and other more innocuous species may help land managers with early detection. Malmstrom, C.M., H.S. Butterfield, L. Planck, C.W. Long, and V.T. Eviner. (2017). Novel fine-scale aerial mapping approach quantifies grassland weed cover dynamics and response to management. PLOS ONE 12(10): e0181665. Barbed goatgrass matures in late spring after most other annual grasses have already senesced, and this method utilizes these differences in phenology to easily identify patches that require management. Controlled burning is one method being used by the University of California in small areas to try and control the amount of barbed goatgrass. To be most effective, multiple burns had to be put in place in the isolated area over two years to more fully rid the area of the grass. After the burns, many native species were able to live in the small area once again. Another control method, used by both the University of California and the Weed Science Society of America to control barbed goatgrass, is the spraying of glyphosate. Used over a two-year period in small areas, glyphosate was able kill barbed goatgrass and all its seedlings. Although the chemical is effective in killing barbed goatgrass, it also kills the other plants in the area. Aminocyclopyrachlor, a new experimental chemical is being used to control barbed goatgrass by the University of California's Weed Science department. It has been shown to be extremely effective, however, aminocyclopyrachlor is not a registered herbicide and as such, widespread use is not yet allowed. Mowing of the grass is another control method. It allows the grass to be cut before maturing and developing seeds to reproduce, but it is not as effective as the other methods as the deep and established root system of the barbed goatgrass is still in place and can grow again. Impact on humans Although there are many ways to control the growth of barbed goatgrass, a real solution has not been found in its widespread prevention. Barbed goatgrass cross breeds with different types of wheat, causing the grain to become infertile and unusable for harvest, which hurts the economy of the rural California areas. It can also seriously harm grazing animals by the barbs becoming embedded in their nose, mouth, and eyes, causing farmers and ranchers extra expenses. It reduces the amount of forage in the area, decreases biodiversity and overall degrades the ecosystem it resides in. Studies of the University of California also show that if climate change increased the amount of precipitation in the area, the amount of barbed goatgrass may increase, destroying even more of its ecosystem. Its rapid growth and resiliency against control methods prove that barbed goatgrass is an invasive species that could cause many more problems to the agriculture of California and possibly many other areas if it is not taken care of soon.

The scout battalions of the 297th Infantry, Army National Guard, which patrolled the western border of Alaska, recruited native Alaskan women for duty and it needed a special training program. The WAC Center assigned a team of trainers to the project. \\"The team visited Alaska, studied the problems involved, returned to Fort McClellan, drew up a course, then returned to Alaska.\\" Fifty-two female recruits participated in the course at Camp Carroll in Anchorage, and fifty-one graduated. The course taught \\"map reading, marching, communications procedures, intelligence gathering, arctic survival and bivouac, first aid, weapons (M16 rifle), and other subjects.\\" After completing the basic training, the women went to Army training schools outside Alaska for advanced individual training before being assigned for duty with the scout battalions. The course was successful and it was repeated in 1978. In 2004, a company of infantry was mobilized to serve in Iraq, serving with the Hawaii Army National Guard's 29th Brigade in 2005. In 2005 through 2008 smaller detachments were deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan. An infantry battalion was deployed to the Middle East in 2006, and another infantry company was deployed to Iraq in 2007. The Alaska Army National Guard's aviation units have seen a series of company-sized rotations to Iraq, including the loss of a helicopter and crew in January 2006.Information on all of these deployments is available at the Alaska DMVA website, for example http://www.ak-prepared.com/dmva/press-releases/11Nov06%20patch.pdf, which conveniently lists them. However the .pdf format may not be suitable for reference links if users have limited bandwidth. These deployments seem small in comparison to the units that other states have deployed. However given the small size of Alaska's population and National Guard they represent a very large percentage of the Alaska Army National Guard. When young men are deployed there is a particular impact on smaller \\"Alaska Bush\\" villages that have a subsistence lifestyle. The 49th Missile Defense Battalion (GMD) is an Alaska Army National Guard unit that is permanently on active duty at Fort Greely, as part of the 100th Missile Defense Brigade (GMD). The Alaska Army National Guard regularly sends soldiers to train in Mongolia as part of the State Partnership Program. In addition, the Mongolian Army deployments to Iraq were typically accompanied by Alaska Army Guard members. Now that the Mongolian Army has shifted its focus to Afghanistan, Alaska National Guard soldiers accompany them there. Alaska Department of Military and Veteran's Affairs, Accessed 1 July 2010. An instructor conducting a cold-weather preparedness class, January 2015 In 2007 the original insignia of the 207th Infantry Battalion was readopted for use by the 207th Regiment; the insignia was reinstated and redesignated for the 207th Regiment with the description and symbolism revised on 7 April 1997.(TIOH) In 2008, the Alaska Guard began transforming the 207th Infantry Group into the modular 297th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade. It had originally been intended to become the 207th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, prior to the National Guard Rebalance Initiative. In addition the 38th Troop Command was stood up to provide command and control for miscellaneous units. In 2013, media coverage increasingly focused on allegations of misconduct within the Alaska National Guard. These incidents included the dismissal of a senior officer in a high-profile post for failing to control or actively encouraging sexual misconduct among subordinates, as well as allegations of longstanding problems with both sexual assaults within the ranks and a command climate that suppressed reporting of these crimes and targeted whistle blowers for retaliation. By late 2013, the situation had become high-profile enough that the Alaska National Guard leadership appointed a special investigator to pursue inquiries into the pervasive problem of sexual misconduct and the organizational culture and command climate that condoned and promoted it.

Besides unagi, the same preparation is made of other long scaleless fish such as hamo (pike conger), doj≈ç (loach), catfish, anago (conger eel), and (gunnels). One can also find canned products labeled as kabayaki-style sanma (Pacific saury). Kabayaki eel is very popular and a rich source of vitamins A and E, and omega-3 fatty acids., p.144- A popular custom from the Edo period, pp.167-8, repeats a story of a certain eel purveyor from Edo who asked a calligrapher to write the Ox (day) character as a sign calls for eating kabayaki during the summer to gain stamina, especially on a particular mid-summer day called , which can fall anywhere between July 18 ‚Äì August 8 each year., p.372 describes Doyo as \\"about eighteen days from July 20th\\", though in actuality the beginning date can shift a day or two. The days cycle through the twelve animals (twelve heavenly branches) so any one or two of the dates within the eighteen-day period can fall on an Ox day. The eel kabayaki is often served on top of a bowl (donburi) of rice, and called unadon, the fancier form of which is the unaj≈´, placed inside a tiered lacquered boxes called j≈´bako. It is also torn up and mixed up evenly with rice to make , which is enjoyed especially in the Nagoya area. Kant≈ç vs. Kansai Eel kabayaki Broadly, two schools of cooking the kabayaki exist. In the Kant≈ç region (eastern Japan), the eel is slit down its back, p.140 and butterflied, so a lighter-colored stripe of the belly runs down the middle of each fillet on the skin side. The long eel is cut into shorter, squarer fillets and skewered., p.9 In Kanto, the skewered eel is first grilled, plain, into what is known as , then steamed, before being flavored and grilled again; as a result, it turns out more tender and flakier after grilling., p.144- In the Kansai region (western Japan), the eel is slit down the belly and directly grilled without being steamed, often still in their original length, and called . The outer skin could be tough and chewy, so eel cooked in Kansai style may be placed between layers of hot rice, for the steam to help tenderize it. In the Kansai area, the eel is often called mamushi,, p.9 just like the name of the common viper in Japan, Gloydius blomhoffii). Some speculate the name is a corruption of mabushi meaning \\"besprinkle\\", while others say it is a reference to the eel being rather similar to the viper in shape and vigor-endowing abilities when consumed. Etymology Several hypothesized origins for the name kabayaki are given. The name came to be generally written using the kanji Ëí≤ÁÑº meaning cattail-grilled. Resemblance to the brown plush flower spikes of the cattail plant has been suggested as etymological origin in several old writings (; the writings of ; , p.67). Food historian (1881‚Äì1958) has argued that originally the whole eel was skewered vertically and cooked that way, giving rise to the name on the resemblance to the cattail both in form and color. This is incidentally the same as one hypothesized etymology for kamaboko. Another touted theory explains the name as due to resemblance of the charred skin side to the (, .

The battle resulted in the burning of several quarters of the city (primarily Turkish, but also Greek) and massacres which resulted in the deaths of several thousand Turkish and Greek soldiers and civilians. Background Aydƒ±n was a central town of the fertile Menderes River (Meander) valley in western Turkey. Although Menderes River valley was not mandated for an occupation by Greek troops by the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, Italian Navy's movements off the coast of Ku≈üadasƒ± had oriented the Greek high command towards becoming the first power to establish an influence in this region. =Extension of occupation zone= The Greek High Commissioner Aristidis Stergiadis, who had arrived in Smyrna on 21 May, authorised on 23 May the troops commanded by Colonel Nikolaos Zafeiriou to issue orders for the occupation of Aydƒ±n, Manisa and Turgutlu. The subject of the size of the territory to be occupied by Greek forces were to be governed by uncertainty until 2 June, when Commodore Maurice FitzMaurice from the Royal Navy was appointed to determine the limits of the occupation zone. =Inter- Allied Commission= The principal source on the fighting and the massacres remains the Report of the Inter-Allied Commission of Inquiry of October 1919. This report was ordered by the Paris Peace Conference acting on a July 1919 letter by the Ottoman sheikh ul-Islam and prepared by four generals of the Allied powers following their on-the-spot checks and presented to the Conference in October. In Aydƒ±n, the Inter-Allied Inquiry Commission had held several meetings for a week in early September 1919, in the city of Aydƒ±n self, in √áine in the Italian zone, to hear the statements of Turkish refugees from Aydƒ±n, and in Nazilli in the zone occupied by the forces of the Turkish national movement, where it interrogated refugees, including Greek refugees, also from Aydƒ±n. Active stage After its occupation of Smyrna, the Greek army had started to advance into inner Western Anatolia from the first day of their landing at Smyrna and the incursion had extended into the Menderes valley in the second week of the occupation. Aydƒ±n, the central city of the region, was occupied on 27 May. The rapid advance of Greek troops into the country had increased the agitation of the population. Throughout the Aydƒ±n region the population was armed, Turks as well as Greeks. The Greek Command also erred in tolerating the action of armed Greek civilians, armed by Greece since February, who, under the pretext of assisting the Greek troops, began looting and committing all manner of excesses. =Initial Armed conflicts, 27 June= The group of efe led by Y√∂r√ºk Ali during the battle The warfare around Aydƒ±n started by an ambush on 27 June of a Greek patrol by irregular Turkish forces led by Y√∂r√ºk Ali Efe at Malga√ß train station, south of Aydƒ±n. =Conflicts in downtown, 28 June = According to the Inter-Allied Inquiry Commission's report, in the course of reconnaissance patrols around Aydƒ±n, some of the villages were burned down by Greek detachments. They were repulsed in Malga√ß and the efe pursued the troops till the outskirts of the city of Aydƒ±n. On 28 June, the attackers began to use 105-mm guns. Some of the fires that broke out in the quarter of Cuma, one of Aydƒ±n's Turkish quarters, in the morning of 29 June started during this engagement. Other fires also broke out in this quarter at various isolated points. A large number of Turkish men, women and children who were trying to leave the burning quarter were killed for no reason by the Greek soldiers, who were guarding all the exits that led from this quarter to the northern part of the town. The report observes that there was no doubt that the Greek Command and troops ran amok. The Greeks evacuated the town in the night of 29 June and early hours of 30 June after having committed numerous attacks and other crimes. A large number of Greek civilians hoping to escape by accompanying the troops as they retreated were prevented from doing so by the Command. A subsequent fire in the Greek quarter was started by Turkish gangs under their leader Y√∂ruk Ali, once they took control of the city. The gangs entered the quarter in the morning of 30 June and burnt it down after having looted the houses, killing the occupants. Irrespective of age or sex, a number of Greek inhabitants encountered by the gangs as they roamed through the town were ruthlessly killed. Around 2000 or 3000 inhabitants were robbed but not killed. They had managed to take refuge in the French convent before the gangs arrived, after which they sought the protection of Colonel ≈ûefik Bey, Commander of the small Ottoman Division present in the city. =Reoccupation, 4 July= The Greek troops, with the help of reinforcements sent by General Konstantinos Nider, headed by lieutenant Colonel Stavrianopoulos recaptured Aydƒ±n on 4 July. The reoccupation of Aydƒ±n was ordered by the Greek High Command in spite of the express orders of the representative of the Entente. The Greek authorities acted on orders received from Venizelos in Paris on 2 July. These orders prevented the representative of the Entente from intervening in the matter. Once in Aydƒ±n, they set fire to the Turkish quarter situated in the western part of the town, where there were also some Greek factories. According to the Inter-Allied Inquiry Commission report, all the fires that were started between 29 June and 4 July most probably had destroyed two thirds of the city of Aydƒ±n, which had a population of 20,000, including some 8000 Greeks. Most of the villages situated along the railway track between Balacƒ±k and Aydƒ±n were also destroyed by fires started in the course of the military operations that took place in the region. The occupation of the vilayet of Aydƒ±n by the Greek forces had caused significant material losses to crops and property, some attributable to looting, theft and the destruction of livestock. Considerable losses were also suffered due to the burning of houses, villages and the town of Aydƒ±n. =Aftermath= Before the Greek army returned to Aydƒ±n, most of the Turkish population had already left the town and surrounding area, with the Turkish soldiers, in order to take refuge in the Italian zone or in the Nazilli-Denizli region, where they remained till the end of the war. On the other hand, the Greek population of the town was either massacred by the Turks (the dead bodies founded by the Greek army after the retake of the town), or taken to captivity in the interior of Anatolia. Colonel Georgios Kondylis with his regiment took orders to hunt the Turkish and did so by passing the Meander river and entering the Italian zone. =End of hostilities= The city of Aydƒ±n remained in ruins until it was re-captured by the Turkish army on 7 September 1922, at the end of the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). Casualties It has not been possible for the Inter-Allied Inquiry Commission to ascertain the total number of Greek or Turkish victims. The representative of the Greek Government, who gave evidence before the Commission on 7 September, estimated the number of Greek victims to be in the region of 2000. Some 900 bodies had already been recovered by that time. An English witness put this number at about 400. A French officer conducting an on-the-spot investigation several days after the events took place put the number of victims at 1500 to 2000 Greeks and 1200 to 1500 Turks, however acknowledging that estimating the number of Turkish victims was a very difficult task. Results Inter-Allied Inquiry Commission valued the losses resulting from the burning of Aydƒ±n at approximately eight million Pounds sterling (1919 currency terms). When the Turkish inhabitants abandoned their houses and fled from the districts occupied by the Greeks, they also abandoned their crops, leaving them unharvested. The indirect losses were estimated to be at one million two hundred thousand Pounds by the Commission. The total losses (direct and indirect) in 2005 values using the UK Retail Prices Index were in the order of 283,160,000 Pounds sterling (about five hundred million United States dollars roughly).

The route connects US 82/SR 39/SR 50 in Georgetown with US 17/SR 25 in Brunswick, via Lumpkin, Preston, Americus, Vienna, Hawkinsville, Eastman, Helena‚ÄìMcRae, Hazlehurst, Baxley, and Jesup. The highway is concurrent with US 280 and US 341 for most of its length (the latter one at its eastern terminus). Route description SR 27 begins at an intersection with US 82/SR 39/SR 50 (Middle Street) in Georgetown, within Quitman County. SR 27/SR 39 travel concurrently to the northeast. Then, the two highways diverge with SR 27 continuing through rural areas of the northeastern part of the county. The highway enters Stewart County, before entering Lumpkin. There it intersects US 27/SR 1\\\\. Three blocks later is the southern terminus of SR 1 Conn. (Chestnut Street). Farther to the northeast, in Richland, is an intersection with US 280/SR 520 (Richland Bypass). At this intersection, US 280/SR 27 begin a concurrency to the east. After leaving town, the concurrency enters Webster County. They curve to the southeast and enter Preston, where SR 41 briefly joins the concurrency. Farther along, US 280/SR 27 enter Sumter County. They enter Plains. In town is an intersection with SR 45 (Bond Street). The two highways stairstep their way to the east-northeast toward Americus. Just before entering town, first SR 49 (Salters Mill Road), and then US 19/SR 3 (South Martin Luther King Boulevard), join the concurrency. The five highways enter the city limits and curve to the northeast. Next to the Perlis Plaza Shopping Center, they intersect SR 30\\\\. At this intersection, US 280/SR 27/SR 30 east/SR 49 turn to the right, while US 19/SR 3/SR 30 west (North Martin Luther King Boulevard) continue to the northeast. The four highways intersect SR 377 (South Lee Street). Just past Oak Grove Cemetery, SR 49 departs the concurrency on Tripp Street. Next to Pine Pointe Shopping Center, SR 27 departs the concurrency to the east on Vienna Road and passes Shipp Lake and Pat Crumpton Lake, before intersecting SR 195\\\\. After that, it crosses over the Flint River into Dooly County. The highway travels to the north of Bartenfield Lake and enters Vienna. Just inside the city limits, it intersects SR 90\\\\. The two highways travel concurrent into the main part of town, to an intersection with US 41/SR 7 (3rd Street). At this intersection, SR 90 leaves the concurrency to the south, while SR 27 continues to the east-southeast. It passes George Busbee Park and meets the western terminus of SR 215 (East Union Street). Here, SR 27 curves to the north-northeast and leaves town. It curves to a more northeasterly routing and has an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75). Then, it curves to a nearly due-east orientation. After a bend to the northeast, the highway enters Pulaski County. There are two portions of SR 27 that are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: * The segment from Richland to Americus, concurrent with US 280 * The segment from Hawkinsville to its eastern terminus, concurrent with US 341 History =1920s= SR 27 was established at least as early as 1919 from Hawkinsville to a point northwest of Brunswick. It was also designated south-southwest and curved to the southeast to end at SR 40 northwest of St. Marys. At this time, SR 28 was established from SR 39 in Georgetown to SR 7 in Vienna. By the end of 1921, SR 50 was established on its current path in Georgetown, becoming SR 27's new western terminus, since SR 39 was shifted southeast and out of the city. The eastern terminus of SR 27 was then indicated to be at SR 25 in Brunswick. SR 27 had a segment northwest of Brunswick, which meant that it intersected itself. It was then proposed south-southwest to SR 40 in Kingsland. By the end of 1926, US 341 was designated on SR 27 from Hawkinsville to Brunswick. The separate segment from north-northwest of Brunswick to Kingsland was redesignated as US 17/SR 25\\\\. Nearly the entire Sumter County portion of the Preston‚ÄìAmericus segment of SR 28, as well as the portion of US 341/SR 27 east of US 17/SR 25, had a \\"completed hard surface\\". A portion of US 341/SR 27 straddling the Wayne‚ÄìGlynn county line had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\". Nearly the entire Dooly County portion of the Americus‚ÄìVienna segment of SR 28 had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. Four segments of US 341/SR 27 also had this type of surface: the entire Telfair County portion, nearly the entire Appling County portion of the Hazlehurst‚ÄìBaxley segment, from Baxley to just east of the Appling‚ÄìWayne county line, and the northern part of the Jesup‚ÄìBrunswick segment. A portion of SR 28 east-southeast of Preston, as well as nearly the entire Wayne County portion of the Baxley‚ÄìJesup and the central portion of Glynn County segments of US 341/SR 27, was under construction. By the end of 1929, US 341/SR 27 had a completed hard surface west-northwest of Jesup. East of Lumpkin and in the Preston area, SR 28 had a sand clay or top soil surface. Southeast of Baxley, US 341/SR 27 also had this type of surface. Three segments of US 341/SR 27 were under construction: from Hawkinsville to Eastman, from McRae to Lumber City, and the entire Appling County portion of the Hazlehurst‚ÄìBaxley segment. Two segments of US 341/SR 27 had completed grading: nearly the entire Lumber City‚ÄìHazlehurst segment and nearly the entire Appling County portion of the Baxley‚ÄìJesup segment. =1930s= By the middle of 1930, SR 28 was extended northeast to Hawkinsville. The entire Glynn County portion of US 341/SR 27 had a completed hard surface. A portion of SR 28 east-southeast of Preston, as well as the McRae‚ÄìLumber City segment and Wayne County portion of the Baxley‚ÄìJesup segment of US 341/SR 27, had a sand clay or top soil surface. A portion of SR 28 west-northwest of Preston was under construction. By the end of the year, a portion of US 341/SR 27 east-southeast of Baxley had a sand clay or top soil surface. SR 28's segment between Richland and Preston, as well as the Dooly County portion of the Eastman‚ÄìMcRae segment of US 341/SR 27, and a portion of those highways northwest of the Wayne‚ÄìGlynn county line, was under construction. By the end of 1931, US 280 was designated on SR 28 between Richland and Americus. Three segments of US 341/SR 27 had a completed hard surface: from Hawkinsville to Eastman, from northwest of McRae to Hazlehurst, and from east-southeast of Hazlehurst to Baxley. Two segments of those highways were under construction: from Eastman to northwest of McRae and a portion east-southeast of Hazlehurst. In April 1932, the Hazlehurst‚ÄìBaxley segment of US 341/SR 27 had a completed hard surface. By the beginning of August, their segment between Eastman to McRae was also completed. In September, the Vienna‚ÄìHawkinsville segment of SR 28 had a sand clay or top soil surface. Late in 1934, the northern half of the Appling County portion of the Baxley‚ÄìJesup segment of US 341/SR 27, as well as a small portion east of the Appling‚ÄìWayne county line, had a completed hard surface. In the second quarter of 1935, two segments of US 341/SR 27 had a completed hard surface: from Baxley to just east of the Appling‚ÄìWayne county line and nearly the entire Wayne County portion of the Baxley‚ÄìJesup segment. A small portion east- southeast of the Appling‚ÄìWayne county line had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the beginning of October, the entire Wayne County portion of the Baxley‚ÄìJesup segment had a completed hard surface. A portion just west of the Appling‚ÄìWayne county line was under construction. By the end of the year, from Baxley to a point southeast of Jesup, US 341/SR 27 had a completed hard surface. Near the end of the year, from Richland to just west of the Webster‚ÄìSumter county line, SR 28 was under construction. The year ended with two additional changes to SR 28\\\\. From northwest of Preston to east-southeast of it, the highway had a completed hard surface. From Richland to northwest of Preston, it had a sand clay or top soil surface. In the first quarter of 1937, a portion of SR 28 in the southwestern part of Hawkinsville had a completed hard surface. It was under construction from just east of the Dooly‚ÄìPulaski county line to southwest of Hawkinsville. In the third quarter of the year, the entire Jesup‚ÄìBrunswick segment had a completed hard surface. At the end of the year, the entire length of SR 28 was redesignated as a western extension of SR 27\\\\. From the Dooly‚ÄìPulaski county line to southwest of Hawkinsville, the highway had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The western half of the Lumpkin‚ÄìRichland segment was under construction. In 1938, from east- southeast of Preston to east of the Webster‚ÄìSumter county line, SR 27 was under construction. By the middle of 1939, US 25 was extended southward, onto the Jesup‚ÄìBrunswick segment of US 341/SR 27\\\\. The western part of the Lumpkin‚ÄìRichland segment had a completed hard surface, while the central part of it had completed grading, but was not surfaced. A portion east of Americus was under construction. In the third quarter of the year, this segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. At the end of the year, a portion just west of the Dooly‚ÄìPulaski county line was under construction. =1940s to 1990s= In the first quarter of 1940, the entire Preston‚ÄìAmericus segment had a completed hard surface. In the third quarter of the year, the western half of the Quitman County portion of the Georgetown‚ÄìLumpkin segment was under construction. During the second half of the next year, a portion east- northeast of Vienna had a completed hard surface. The western half of the Quitman County portion of the Georgetown‚ÄìLumpkin segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The western part of the Webster County portion of the Richland‚ÄìPreston segment was under construction. In 1942, from just east-northeast of Richland to Preston, the highway had a completed hard surface. Between the beginning of 1945 and November 1946, a portion from just west of Richland to Preston was hard surfaced. By February 1948, four segments were hard surfaced: from Georgetown to a point west-southwest of Lumpkin, the Lumpkin‚ÄìRichland segment, a portion east-southeast of Americus, and the entire Pulaski County segment. Also, the eastern part of the Sumter County portion of the Americus‚ÄìVienna segment had a sand clay or top soil surface. By April 1949, the entire Georgetown‚ÄìLumpkin segment was hard surfaced. Between August 1950 and January 1952, the eastern half of the Dooly County portion of the Americus‚ÄìVienna segment was hard surfaced. In 1953, the entire Dooly County portion (except the extreme western part) was hard surfaced. Between June 1955 and July 1957, the entire highway from Georgetown to Brunswick was paved. In 1972, SR 39 was extended northward on the westernmost portion of SR 27, as it travels today. Between the beginning of 1981 and the beginning of 1987, SR 782 was proposed between US 25/US 341/SR 27 and SR 27 Alt. In 1989, a southwestern bypass of Eastman, designated as SR 841, was proposed from US 341/SR 27 west of the city to US 23/US 341/SR 27 southeast of it. In 1993, US 341/SR 27 through Eastman was shifted southward out of the main part of the city onto the path of SR 841\\\\. Their former path was redesignated as US 341 Bus./SR 27 Bus. Between the beginning of 1987 and the beginning of 1997, US 23/US 341/SR 27 through Jesup was shifted northeast onto the path of SR 27 Alt. and SR 782 Major intersections Special routes =Eastman business loop= State Route 27 Business (SR 27 Bus.) is a business route of SR 27 that exists entirely within the central part of Dodge County. The route is almost entirely within the city limits of Eastman. It begins just west of Eastman, at an intersection with US 341/SR 27.It travels to the northeast on Fish Road, concurrent with US 341 Bus./SR 46\\\\. Then, they curve to a due-east direction, onto Hawkinsville Highway. They enter the city limits of Eastman and curve to the southeast, onto Ogden Street. They turn left onto 5th Avenue and travel to the northeast. At an intersection with US 23/SR 87/SR 117 (Oak Street), SR 46 departs the concurrency, and US 23/SR 87/SR 117 join it. At Griffin Street, SR 87/SR 117 departs the concurrency. The three highways continue to the southeast and intersect US 341/SR 27 (Terry Coleman Parkway). Here, US 341 Bus. and SR 27 Bus. end, and US 23 joins the US 341/SR 27 concurrency. SR 27 Bus. is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. In 1989, a southwestern bypass of Eastman, designated as SR 841, was proposed from US 341/SR 27 west of the city to US 23/US 341/SR 27 southeast of it. In 1993, US 341/SR 27 through Eastman was shifted southward out of the main part of the city onto the path of SR 841\\\\. Their former path was redesignated as US 341 Bus./SR 27 Bus. =McRae loop route= State Route 27 Loop (SR 27 Loop) was a loop route of SR 27 that existed in the north-central part of Telfair County. In 1977, it was established from US 23/US 341/SR 27 in Helena, through the northern part of Helena and McRae, to an intersection with US 23/US 341/SR 27 in McRae. In 1987, SR 27 Loop was decommissioned. =Jesup alternate route= State Route 27 Alternate (SR 27 Alt.) was an alternate route of SR 27 that existed in the north-central part of Wayne County. It existed entirely within the city limits of Jesup. Between June 1960 and June 1963, it was established from US 23/US 341/SR 27 in the northwest part of the city to an intersection with US 23/US 25/US 301/US 341/SR 23/SR 27 in the southeastern part of the city. It had a sole segment and a southwestern one-block concurrency with US 25/US 301/SR 23. In 1989, US 23/US 341/SR 27 was shifted northeast, replacing nearly the entire length of SR 27 Alt. =Brunswick spur route= State Route 27 Spur (SR 27 Spur) was a spur route of SR 27 that existed in the south- central part of Glynn County and completely within the city limits of Brunswick. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, it was established and hard surfaced on 1st Avenue, extending west-southwest from US 84/US 341/SR 27 (Newcastle Street). In 1981, it was decommissioned.

Kinser. Early and Family Life In 1973, Hassell graduated from Norview High School in Norfolk, Virginia, where his classmates voted him \\"most likely to succeed\\". Hassell attended the University of Virginia for his undergraduate degree, earning a BA in 1977 (and earlier achieving the coveted distinction of residing in a room on the Lawn or original campus designed by Thomas Jefferson. Hassell then attended Harvard Law School, where he edited the Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review and received his J.D. in 1980. Career After law school and following admission to the Virginia State Bar, Hassell worked for the Richmond branch of McGuire Woods, where he was made a partner in seven years (1987). He also served as co-counsel to the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority and as chair of the Richmond School Board. Governor Gerald Baliles appointed Hassell, although only 34 years old, to the Virginia Supreme Court in 1989, and he was seated with legislative approval. In 2002, after the legislature allowed the justices to choose their Chief Justice, his peers selected him. Hassell thus became the first African‚ÄìAmerican Chief Justice of Virginia when sworn into that office on February 1, 2003. As Chief Justice, Hassell advocated for an independent judiciary as well as greater access to legal services for all Virginians. He also established a commission to reform Virginia's outdated mental health laws. Hassell also served as jurist-in-residence at the Regent University School of Law, and on the school's Board of Visitors.

New Kilbowie was built for Clydebank Juniors in 1939. In 1964, Clydebank merged with East Stirlingshire and entered the Scottish Football League. A record attendance of 14,900 was set by a visit of Hibernian in February 1965. Floodlights were first used in a match against Sunderland in the same month. The merger collapsed after a legal battle, but Clydebank entered the league in their own right in 1966. Clydebank were promoted to the Premier Division in 1977. A covered plastic-seated stand was built, which was funded by selling star player Davie Cooper for ¬£100,000 to Rangers. To avoid having to apply legislation affecting stadium safety, the club installed wooden benches that reduced the capacity to 9,950. This was below the 10,000 limit at which the legislation started to apply and technically made Kilbowie the first all- seater stadium in the United Kingdom. Clydebank played their last competitive game at Kilbowie against Hamilton Academical in 1996 (1-3). The last ever game at Kilbowie was a testimonial match later that summer for Ken Eadie, against Rangers (2-3). The ground was sold by club owners, the Steedman family, in 1997. Clydebank endured several seasons groundsharing at Cappielow in Greenock and Boghead Park in Dumbarton. Land was purchased on Great Western Road on the outskirts of the town to construct a new stadium for the club, but the necessary approval was never obtained. The sale of Kilbowie Park was the catalyst for the club's decline, which was finally ended in 2002. The club was purchased from its administrator by Jim Ballantyne, who moved it to Airdrie, North Lanarkshire and renamed it Airdrie United. This was done to replace the Airdrieonians club, which had been liquidated earlier in 2002. Clydebank F.C. was reformed as a junior club by the United Clydebank Supporters and it now plays at Holm Park in Yoker. Kilbowie was purchased by Vico Properties plc, who developed a retail scheme and restaurants on the ground.

In 1983, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, becoming the first African American and (being 32) the youngest person of any race to sit there. In the middle of his seventh year on the court, he resigned (due to illness) and was succeeded by Leroy Rountree Hassell, Sr.. who later became the court's first black chief justice. Judge Thomas now practices law in Richmond, Virginia as part of the Hunton & Williams LLP law firm. In 1995, he received the NAACP's Lifetime Image Award. In 2005, Thomas was named a member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland. The members of the Court include lawyers and former jurists from around the world. CAS is an independent arbitral institution created in 1983 to settle sports-related disputes involving drug violations and rules of international sports federations. It hears cases arising from most world-class sporting competition and has global jurisdiction. The Court has offices in Lausanne, Switzerland; Sydney, Australia; and New York City, and establishes ad hoc offices in Olympic host cities, as required. In 2006, Thomas was appointed to the Board of Visitors of the College of William & Mary, a position to which he was reappointed in 2009.

It is located some 45 km north of Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, on the banks of Lake Kiementas. It is the capital of an elderate. The town, according to a local legend founded by Duke Giedrius, is first mentioned in written sources in 1338 when Grand Duke Gediminas signed a peace treaty with the Teutonic Knights. For a long time it was the centre of Giedraitis family estate. History It is known that since 1777 the town had a parish school. A hundred years later it was reorganized to a grammar, and later to middle school. Today the high school is named after Antanas Jaro≈°eviƒçius, a painter who in 1912 published an album of Lithuanian crosses. The school building houses a small museum about local history. In 1410 Church of St. Bartholomew the Apostle was built. It was rebuilt in 1809 in the Classicism style by Bishop of Samogitia J√≥zef Giedroyƒá (), whose princely family originated from Giedraiƒçiai. In 1838, after his death and according to his wishes, J√≥zef Giedroyƒá's heart was inlaid into one of the walls. In the mid-19th century a new bell tower was built. It is interesting because of unusual design: stone walls are decorated with red bricks. In 1920 the town witnessed fights between Lithuanians and Poles led by Lucjan ≈ªeligowski. After the Polish-Lithuanian War, ≈ªeligowski staged a fake rebellion by Polish army units and captured Vilnius on October 9, 1920. His troops were advancing further, but were stopped near Giedraiƒçiai and ≈†irvintos on November 17‚Äì21. League of Nations interfered and the fighting stopped, but the disputes over the Vilnius region were not resolved. Today the town commemorates the Lithuanian victims with a monument which has survived the Soviet regime. On ornament from the monument, a sword and a trumpet, is used in the coat of arms of the town. During the occupation of Lithuania by Germany and its rule under German military, on July 7, 1941 and at the beginning of August 1941, a death squad of Lithuanian collaborators, ordered by German military administration, murdered Jews of the town in mass executions.http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search//page/1/item/26/ Transport Molƒótai Aero Club (ICAO airport code: EYMO) is located some 7 km north of Giedraiƒçiai.

Taccola is known for his technological treatises De ingeneis and De machinis, which feature annotated drawings of a wide array of innovative machines and devices. Taccola's work was widely studied and copied by later Renaissance engineers and artists, among them Francesco di Giorgio, and Leonardo da Vinci.  Life and career  Mariano Taccola was born in Siena in 1382. Practically nothing is known of his early years of training or apprenticeship.Lawrence Fane, p.136 As an adult, he pursued a varied career in Siena, working in such diverse jobs as notary, university secretary, sculptor, superintendent of roads and hydraulic engineer.Lon R. Shelby, p.466 In the 1440s, Taccola retired from his official positions, receiving a pension from the state. He is known to have joined the fraternal order of San Jacomo by 1453 and presumably died around that date.Lawrence Fane, p.137  Work and style  Taccola left behind two treatises, the first being De ingeneis (Concerning engines), work on its four books starting as early as 1419.Lon R. Shelby, p.467 Having been completed in 1433, Taccola continued to amend drawings and annotations to De ingeneis until about 1449. In the same year, Taccola published his second manuscript, De machinis (Concerning machines), in which he restated many of the devices from the long development process of his first treatise. Drawn with black ink on paper and accompanied by hand-written annotations, Taccola depicts in his work a multitude of 'ingenious devices' in hydraulic engineering, milling, construction and war machinery. Taccola's drawings show him to be a man of transition: While his subject matter is already that of later Renaissance artist-engineers, his method of representation still owes much to medieval manuscript illustration.Lawrence Fane, p.138 Notably, with perspective coming and going in his drawings, Taccola seemed to remain largely unaware of the ongoing revolution in perspective painting.Lawrence Fane, p.139 This is the more curious, since he is the only man known to have interviewed the 'father of linear perspectivity' himself, Filippo Brunelleschi. Despite these graphic inconsistencies, Taccola's style has been described as being forceful, authentic and usually to be relied upon to capture the essential.Lawrence Fane, p. 137ff.  Influence and rediscovery  The work of Taccola, named the 'Sienese Archimedes', stands at the beginning of the tradition of Italian Renaissance artist-engineers, with a growing interest in technological matters of all kinds. Taccola's drawings were copied and served as a source of inspiration by such as Buonacorso Ghiberti, Francesco di Giorgio, and perhaps even Leonardo da Vinci. Of special historical importance are his drawings of the ingenious lifting devices and reversible-gear systems which Brunelleschi devised for the construction of the dome of the Florence cathedral,Lawrence Fane, p.140 at the time the second widest in the world. Interest in Taccola's work, however, practically ceased some time after his death until the late 20th century, one reason perhaps being that his treatises circulated only as hand-copied books, with at least three of them remaining extant today.Lawrence Fane, p.143 Taccola's original manuscripts, whose style turned out to be more sophisticated than those of its copies, were rediscovered and identified in the state libraries of Munich and Florence in the 1960s, giving impetus for the first printed editions of both De ingeneis and De machinis in subsequent years.

It was written by Geoff McQueen, who had previously worked on LWT's The Gentle Touch. Woodentop followed Police Constable Jim Carver (Mark Wingett) on his first day, mentored by Woman Police Constable June Ackland (Trudie Goodwin). The production was seen as innovative for the use of natural lighting, hand-held cameras and an authentic portrayal of British policing. Thames Television commissioned 12 further episodes for transmission in 1984. Woodentop was directed by Peter Cregeen, who had played a part in Z-Cars and Juliet Bravo. The cast included Peter Dean as Sergeant Wilding who went on to play Peter Beale in EastEnders. 1984-1987: \\"The Originals\\" The first episode of The Bill was broadcast at 21:00 hours, on 16 October 1984. From the pilot episode, the actors who portrayed Carver, Ackland, Litten and Morgan (renamed to Edwards) were retained. The character of Detective Inspector Roy Galloway was also retained from the pilot, but was recast to be played by John Salthouse. Several new characters were introduced, such as Sergeant Bob Cryer (replacing Sergeant Bob Wilding from the pilot), Detective Sergeant Tommy Burnside (later changed to Frank) and Chief Superintendent Charles Brownlow. Early episodes of The Bill had a duration of fifty minutes, with thirty-five being produced over the first three series of The Bill. The fifty-minute episodes were broadcast post watershed, allowing the programme to include scenes of nudity, drug use, violence and swearing. The Bill's production base changed from the first two series where it was filmed in Wapping, east London, due to an industrial dispute at an adjoining premises. During March 1987, filming for the third series went ahead in Ladbroke Grove, west London. In 1989, the location changed to Merton, South London, a production base they used till the series ended. The early series was considered to be realistic of how the police operated, with Geoff McQueen's focus on the mundane and the ordinary aspects of a police station, such as filling in forms and paperwork. The investigations displayed in each episode would vary from muggings and domestics, to bomb scares and armed robbery. 1988-1998: Change to the half-hour format During 1988, the decision was made by Thames Director of Programmes to extend the show to a half-hour episode twice a week. The programme was also moved to pre-watershed rather than post, significantly curbing bad language and violence. The new format aired on 19 July 1988. During 1989, Peter Cregeen left ITV to work for the BBC and was replaced by Michael Chapman. Meanwhile, the owners of the set of Sun Hill Police Station set in Barlby Road, decided to renovate the building. This caused Thames Television to look for a new area to host the filming of the police station and selected a disused hospital in Clapham, but this did not go ahead. Instead, Thames settled for an old wine warehouse in Merton industrial estate, near Wimbledon, South London. In 1993, the continued success of the programme led to ITV commissioning three weekly episodes which began at the start of the year. In 1994, the show celebrated its 10th anniversary in October. The special anniversary episodes that week followed Detective Inspector Sally Johnson in court charged with manslaughter after a drug user had died during a police raid. In July that year, the creator and writer Geoff McQueen, died at the age of 46. In 1995, Detective Sergeant Don Beech joined the ranks of Sun Hill, later causing the removal of the CID team in 2000. During 1997, The Bill underwent a series of changes. The Bill's ratings were challenged by BBC One who introduced a number of docusoaps such as Driving School. Michael Chapman, having been Executive Producer since 1989, handed over to Richard Handford. The new Executive Producer introduced a different title sequence, changing the previous theme music and removing the \\"plodding feet\\" at the end credits, with a new one-hour-long format introduced in August that year. 1998-2002: hour-long episodes return After 1998, the original foundations of Geoff McQueen's writing was relaxed to include some characters' private lives, but still remained that an incident would not be seen without a member of cast involved. The old title sequences were entirely removed, in favour of displaying things that are seen to be associated with policing, such as reflective jackets, a suspect being interviewed, and a map in the CAD room. The theme tune was also revamped, with a change from the irregular time signature. During 2000, the programme witnessed one of the largest cast changes in its history. This was partly due to Detective Sergeant Don Beech's corrupt activities which led to the storyline known as the Don Beech Scandal. The scandal was brought about by Beech entering into a corrupt business relationship with a local crime boss, Howard Fallon, who frequently paid Beech to delay investigations and lose evidence. Unknown to Beech, fellow Detective Sergeant Claire Stanton was an undercover officer from the Complaints Investigation Bureau (CIB) who had infiltrated Sun Hill CID to expose suspected corruption. Don Beech also killed Detective Sergeant John Boulton who was in a relationship with Claire Stanton. After killing Boulton, Beech fled to Australia giving way to two spin-off programmes, Beech on the Run and Beech is Back. Don Beech's actions led to the departure of seven characters and the introduction of six new characters. During 2001, Sergeant Bob Cryer was forced into early retirement after he was mistakenly shot during an armed siege by Constable Dale Smith, who was at the time attached to SO19. Cryer was replaced by Sergeant Craig Gilmore. The title sequence was changed to include static photos of the cast and the music was remixed to include the \\"Overkill\\" theme tune, last featured in 1988. The series was also broadcast in widescreen ratio, for the first time. 2002-2007: serial format  During 2002, Executive Producer Richard Handford left the show at the start of the year, being replaced on a temporary basis by Chris Parr. In February, Paul Marquess become the show's producer. Paul Marquess who had previously worked on Brookside, changed the format of The Bill to a serial one, rather than the previous stand alone episodes which included a soap opera narrative. 2002 gave way to several major storylines and the axing of characters, such as the murder of Chief Inspector Derek Conway, when the panda car he was driving was petrol bombed in March that year. Following Conway's death, a memorial fund was organised and a large sum of money was donated by Superintendent Tom Chandler, which prompted Constable Des Taviner to donate an even large sum of money which he had confiscated off a group of youths. While a petrol bombing attack was underway on the police station, Des Taviner discovered that the money was forged. Taviner managed to get hold of a petrol bomb, and threw it into a temporary office in the station yard, where the money was being kept in an attempt to destroy the evidence. Unknown to Des, contractors had left their gas canisters in the office. The canisters ignited leading to the Sun Hill Fire, which caused the death of six characters. During 2003, a live episode of The Bill was broadcast to commemorate the 20th anniversary since the pilot episode, Woodentop. The live episode centred on a siege in the yard, involving a drunken man taking Detective Constable Juliet Becker hostage with a knife, after Constable Cathy Bradford had failed to search the man. Juliet Becker later died of her injuries. During September 2005, a second live episode was broadcast to celebrate the 50th anniversary of ITV1. The second live episode centred on Sun Hill Police Station under siege, after a grief-stricken father laid siege to the station after the driver of the car that killed his son was found to be not guilty. During 2005, a second fire at Sun Hill was caused by Police Community Support Officer Colin Fairfax crashing a van laden with explosives into the front office of Sun Hill Police Station, as a revenge attack after he had been dismissed for his racist behaviour towards Constable Leela Kapoor. This storyline caused the death of three characters. While the series remained fairly grounded in the early days of the new serial format, gradually more sensational and soapy storylines were introduced, many of these aimed to boost the show's ratings. The earliest of these took place in 2002 where viewers witnessed a gay kiss between PC Luke Ashton and Sgt. Craig Gilmore. More of these particular scenes would follow, for example with the lesbian kiss between DS Debbie McAllister and DC Juliet Becker. The show later went on to tackle same-sex marriage in the police force, with the partnership registry of PC Lance Powell and Sgt. Mark Rollins in 2005. The Bill under Marquess featured a male on male rape storyline in 2003, where the victim was DC Mickey Webb, and later in 2005 Sgt. June Ackland revealed she was raped in her teens by a 13-year-old boy. Other sensational aspects of the show were the manner in which characters were killed off - such as the death of PC Cass Rickman at the hands of a serial killer, and that of Superintendent Tom Chandler who shot himself after raping his wife DS Debbie McAllister. Chandler was replaced by Adam Okaro, a black Superintendent played by Cyril Nri. The misguided PC Gabriel Kent became the most prominent character in the darker and sensational storylines, joining the series in early 2003 and lasting out the remainder of the Marquess era as an increasingly unhinged individual. Arguably the most controversial storyline during the Marquess period was the relationship between PC Kent and what viewers assumed was his birth mother, Sgt. June Ackland. PC Kent often stretched viewer credibility with the crimes which he was willing to commit in order to keep his secrets, including deliberately killing his colleague PC Kerry Young while managing to avoid the evidence ever pointing back to him. Another sensational storyline of Marquess's tenure came when the station suffered another explosion in February 2005, three years after the previous, this time caused by disaffected PCSO Colin Fairfax, who drove a van into the front of the station, killing DC Ken Drummond, (who was in the back of the van), SRO Marilyn Chambers and PC Andrea Dunbar (an undercover journalist). A few months after the episode aired, Paul Marquess was signed away by Endemol, the makers of Big Brother, to head their new drama division. His replacement was Johnathan Young, whose name has appeared on the credits since September 2005. Under Johnathan Young's tenure, a second live episode was broadcast on 22 September 2005 to mark the ITV Network's 50th anniversary. The episode was written by Graham Mitchell and, again, co-produced and directed by Sylvie Boden. The Serial format remained in place for the first few months of Johnathan Young era but gradually the serial format was drifted away. 2007-2009: crime based stories During 2006/ 2007 Johnathan Young began retooling the programme which led to noticeable changes in The Bill. Whilst personal storylines remain, they are of less abundance than before, and more time is spent on crime-based Stories. The episode titles were reintroduced beginning with Episode # 490 which was titled Sweet Revenge - broadcast on 21 March 2007, which saw the serial format dropped. A spokesperson for the programme commented on how the titles summed up the 'essence' of an episode. Sensational storylines have also been dropped since 2007. The deaths of officers are far less frequent and the focus of the more dramatic storylines is largely on the crimes being dealt with, and not on the personal lives or conduct of the officers. Arguably the most memorable storyline of the Young era so far was DC Zain Nadir's undercover operation. By mid-2007, The serial format remains in place, the storylines are generally more self-contained and are often dealt with in two or three episode blocks and there is little to no sensational stories or stories about the characters' private lives. An example of this might be the recent Closing The Net two-part storyline and Witness, a storyline which spanned out over eight episodes . The Bill has more frequently featured self-contained episodes, focusing on one or more crime storylines wrapped up in one hour. In this way, the programme more closely resembles the earlier period helmed by Richard Handford. Jonathan Young also axed a few characters in his first few months in the job; * PC Lance Powell * PC Steve Hunter * SRO Julian Travel * CAD Officer Dean McVerry On 3 January 2007 to bring in the new year, the episode opening titles were revamped once again, paying homage to the original 1984 titles. The 2007 ones have shots of London, interspersed with police work and shots of Sun Hill Police Station. The break bumpers and music were also updated. Because of the more compact and less serialised format adopted under Johnathan Young, episode titles were reintroduced, beginning with Episode # 490 which was titled Sweet Revenge - broadcast on 21 March 2007. A spokesperson for the programme commented on how the titles summed up the 'essence' of an episode. 2009‚Äì2010: grittier drama In 2009, the show moved to 9:00 PM with only one episode a week, and the format also received significant changes; the new show was much more focused on the crime rather than the officers, personal stories vanished and incidental music was introduced. The show moved post-watershed, after being pre-watershed for twenty-one years, in order to feature grittier, more action-packed scenes. This was arguably one of the most serious revamps in the show's history. The result of the once a week move was a significant cutdown of the cast. During 2009, nine on-screen characters were written out: * PC Beth Green - Departed in \\"Leap of Faith: Part 2\\" on 18 February 2009. She joined Witness Protection. * PC Arun Ghir - Departed on \\"Decision Time\\" on 19 February 2009, after he was suspended following an incident and later resigned from the force. * PC/ Sgt Diane Noble - Returned to Sun Hill as a sergeant, the third uniformed sgt after Rachel Weston's promotion, following a sabbatical but later announced she was transferring to Barton Street the 3rd uniformed sergeant's job was not replaced. * DC Kezia Walker - Departed in Conviction: Judgement Day; she left Sun Hill to join a People Trafficking unit after being asked by Superintendent John Heaton. Her position in CID was not replaced. * DS Stuart Turner - Departed in Conviction: Judgement Day; she left Sun Hill to join a People Trafficking unit after being asked by Superintendent John Heaton. His former position of DS was given to DC Stevie Moss. * Inspector Rachel Weston - Departed in Conviction: Judgement Day; she left Sun Hill to join a People Trafficking unit after being asked by Superintendent John Heaton. Sergeant Dale Smith replaced her as Inspector. Smithys position was not replaced. * Superintendent John Heaton - Departed in \\"Conviction: Judgement Day\\"; he left Sun Hill to join a People Trafficking unit. DCI Jack Meadows took over as Sun Hill's Superintendent, Jack's former position of DCI was not replaced and DI Neil Manson took over the reins as head of CID. * PC Sally Armstrong - Departed in Unforgiven on 17 December 2009; the reasons behind Sally's departure are not given. * PC Millie Brown ‚Äì Departed in \\"On the Streets: Part 2\\" on 29 December 2009; like PC Sally Armstrong, Millie's reasons for departing are not revealed. Long-running veteran character PC Tony Stamp was sacked by the show's producers; they said that Stamp did not 'fit in with the show's new dynamic'. Actor Graham Cole said he was devastated to leave the show. Tony Stamp last appeared in the episode \\"Rescue Me\\" on 5 November 2009; the character left to join Police Training school Hendon as an advanced driving instructor. Stamp's position at Sun Hill was replaced by new area car driver PC Kirsty Knight. The show began high definition broadcasts on 1 July 2009 with episode number 682, titled \\"Conviction: Cover Up\\". Two episodes later, the episode numbers were reset to 001, on the third episode of a six-part story, and also, due to episodes being aired out of production order, meaning that the episode numbers 684‚Äì689 and 691-693 went unused even though episodes 690 and 694‚Äì697 had already been broadcast. =2010: Cancellation= After less than a year in its new format, with declining ratings, on 26 March 2010, it was announced that ITV would not be commissioning further episodes beyond the current series, citing the new format failing to arrest the ratings decline. However, fans started fighting back, with online petitions, Facebook groups and media attention, in order to get ITV to reconsider. The final episode of The Bill was aired on Tuesday, 31 August 2010, followed by a special tribute show named \\"Farewell The Bill\\".

Furtu or Ibn Furtu (sometimes also called Ibn Fartuwa) lived in the sixteenth century. He was the grand Imam of the Bornu Empire and the chronicler of Mai Idris Alooma (1564‚Äì1596). He wrote two chronicles in Arabic, K. ghazawat Barnu (\\"The Book of the Bornu Wars\\") in 1576 and K. ghazawat Kanei (\\"The Book of the Kanem Wars\\") in 1578. The first book describes in geographical order the military expeditions of Mai Idris Alooma: 1. against the Sao-Gafata in the region of the Komadugu Yobe; 2. against the town of Amsaka south of Lake Chad; 3. against the town of Kano west of Bornu; 4. against the Tuareg of A√Ør; 5. against the Margi and against Mandara south of Lake Chad; 6. against the Ngizim west of Bornu and 7. against the Sao-Tatala at the edge of Lake Chad and against some towns of the Kotoko. Except a few details on the military achievements of the five predecessors of Idris Alooma he focusses his attention on the expeditions of his Sultan during the first twelve years of his reign. The book on the Kanem wars deals with seven consecutive expeditions against the Bulala from ca. 1573 to 1578. Information on earlier events at the beginning and the end of the book concern the destruction of the national relic called Mune by Dunama Dabbalemi (1203‚Äì1242), the expulsion of the Sayfawa from Kanem by the Bulala and the temporary reoccupation of the ancient capital of Kanem Njimi by Idris Katakarmabe (1487‚Äì1509). Some classical poems and quotations from lexicographical books bear witness of the solid education of the author. His somewhat contrived style is characterized by its archaism.

In 1975, it was nominated for the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel and the Nebula Award for Best Novel and won the Mythopoeic Award.  Plot introduction  The setting is in a parallel world where William Shakespeare was not the Bard but the Great Historian. In this world, all the events depicted within Shakespeare's plays were accounts of historical fact, not fiction. As some of the plays depicted anachronistic technology, Anderson extrapolated that this world was more technologically advanced than in reality. However, the fairies of A Midsummer Night's Dream are also part of this world. The novel takes place in the era of Cromwell and Charles I, but the characters deal with the English Civil War which is coeval with an Industrial Revolution. The fairy element provides a plot tension with the more advanced technology. Although various plays are alluded to, the plot is chiefly shaped by A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest. As part of the homage to Shakespeare, the nobler characters speak in blank verse and at least one sonnet, printed as prose.  Plot summary  Prince Rupert is taken by the Roundheads; held captive at a country house, he falls in love with his captor's niece, Jennifer. One of his troopers, Will Fairweather, followed him to the house where he was held captive; with the help of Jennifer, Will brings him to Oberon and Titania, who offer magical aid. Rupert and Jennifer exchange magic rings that will aid them as long as they are true to each other. Rupert sets out with Will to find the books that Prospero sank, in order to aid King Charles. Rupert, fleeing Roundheads, finds refuge in a magical inn, The Old Phoenix, which proves to be a nexus between parallel worlds. Inside the tavern, he meets Valeria Matuchek, who is from an alternate history twentieth- century America. (Originally, the character had been a child in Anderson's Operation Chaos and a teenager in its sequel, Operation Luna, but is now an adult.) Holger Carlsen is another guest, born in a world where the Matter of France is history, and later trapped in \\"our own\\" twentieth-century America (the hero of Anderson's Three Hearts and Three Lions). Valeria explains what will happen in the English Civil War in \\"our\\" timeline, including the king's execution, strengthening Rupert's determination to change events here. He finds a Spanish ship that will transport him; it is carrying an ambassador and his wife. Jennifer's Puritan uncle discovers her on her return, when she resolves to use the ring to find Rupert. She is brought, captive, to a port, where the ring enables her to steal a boat and set sail. The ambassador's wife uses a magic potion to seduce Rupert, and the rings fail. Rupert cannot find his way to the island, and Jennifer is stranded at sea. Despairing, Rupert takes to the library at Milan to try to work out where to find the island and books. Jennifer's plight becomes desperate from thirst, but Ariel (from The Tempest) finds her and brings her to the island. Rupert works out the location, and Jennifer and he are reconciled. They retrieve the books and magically bear them back to England. Charles I has taken up a position near Glastonbury Tor for reasons he does not understand. Rupert attempts the magic; Will Fairweather is possessed by a spirit of England and stirs up the magic of the land. The Roundheads are defeated, and Charles I wins the English Civil War. At the Old Phoenix, Valeria believes that even if \\"romantic reactionaries\\" like Charles I won the English Civil War here, there is still the prospect of technological advance in North America. However, the fairies believed differently‚Äîthey supported the Cavalier cause to delay the disenchantment of this world. Rupert and Jennifer return the rings to Oberon and Titania, and retire to a peaceful married life. Reception Lester del Rey found Anderson's invention to be \\"a lovely conceit\\" and reported the novel to be \\"a fantasy I can recommend with pleasure.\\"\\"Reading Room\\", If, August 1974, pp.147 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reviewer Diana Yates described the novel as \\"an intriguing 'what-if' story ... that could never be considered historical but is indeed fanciful.\\"\\"Book Review\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, October 26, 1978, p.29 Trivia The Old Phoenix appears in several of Poul Anderson's short stories as a nexus between worlds. One of the guards sent to escort Jennifer when she is being used as bait in a trap for the catching of Prince Rupert is named \\"Nehemiah Scudder\\". That was the name of the First Prophet in Heinlein's \\"If This Goes On‚Äî\\".

Bred by Perry Belmont, he was owned by trainer A. J. Joyner, who sold him in early 1908 to Herman Brandt for $3,500. Later that year, Brandt sold the colt to trainer Sam Hildreth. For Hildreth, he was ridden by jockey Cal Shilling and earned back-to-back United States Horse of the Year awards. His major victories came in long races, something his trainer specialized in. In the 1909 Lawrence Realization Handicap, the horse set a world record for a 1-5/8 mile race. His race record in 1909 was fifteen starts with fourteen wins and one second. His only loss came to a filly named Affliction. Lightly raced in 1910, he won two races and finished second in his other two starts. In a deal described by The New York Times as the \\"biggest sale in years,\\" in February 1910 Hildreth sold Fitz Herbert for $40,000 to Charles Kohler, owner of Ramapo Stock Farm in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. Due to the legislated ban on parimutuel betting by the state of New York, a few weeks later Fitz Herbert and other horses owned by Kohler were shipped to stables at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse in France where he was conditioned to compete in steeplechase racing.

It ran for twelve miles from a point on the main line known as Olcott (or Dixon Junction), that was located in Solano County between Sacramento and Rio Vista Junction. Wrm.org: Sacramento Northern Railway Virginia.edu: history The line was built as the Sacramento Valley West Side Electric Railway (SVWSER) in 1914 and commenced operation on January 1, 1915. It was originally intended by its planner, Melville Dozier, to be operated as Vallejo and Northern and would run up the west side of the Sacramento Vallejo from Dixon Junction, through Dixon and then continue north to Woodland and terminate in Marysville. Only the track portion from Dixon Junction to Dixon was ever built. The line was operated by the Oakland, Antioch and Eastern. The SVWSER only survived a few years due to the interurban only serving the small Dixon community of 1,000 residents. In August 1917, permission was granted to abandon the line.

Registrars are only permitted to provide the code to the registered owner of the domain as it appears on a whois query. The code is officially called an AuthInfo Code and an Auth-Info code by ICANN and registry operators. It is alternatively called an auth code, a transfer key, a transfer secret, an EPP code, EPPT authentication code, or EPP authorization code. See Extensible Provisioning Protocol. :\\"This is official notification that the RRP Protocol has been decommissioned from the Com/Net Production Environments during scheduled maintenance on October 28, 2006... All Transfer requests submitted after October 28 will require AuthInfo in order to initiate a transfer request. In the scenario where the domain name does not have an AuthInfo assigned the Losing Registrar must assign an AuthInfo code before the Gaining Registrar can initiate the transfer request.\\" The code supports transferring any domain in the above top-level domains from one Registrar to another. If the code is not provided, then those domains generally cannot be transferred. The code helps identify the domain name holder; it does not constitute transfer approval. Transfers take place within ten days, but usually less than five days. When getting a new registrar, it is prudent to locate the auth-info code and procedure early. Registrars may assume your only interest in the code is so you can take your business away, and might impede your getting your code when you have only a few days left before losing your domain. They might call the code something else (foiling searches), leave it off FAQs, and ignore your emails, and resellers may be even less helpful. Find out in the beginning and keep this important information safe and secure (at the risk that they'll change the method but at least you'll have a starting point). Internic can be used to file complaints if needed, but ICANN does not resolve individual customer complaints. No centralized Internet authority effectively resolves end-user problems. Due diligence before selecting a registrar is important. However, each registrar handles the Transfer-Out process differently, and in some cases will only supply the code at the time it is needed. Because registrars discourage transfers out, it may be necessary to pretend to start the process in order to learn the particular details. In order to successfully transfer a domain, it is vital to remember how to log in with the registrar, and to ensure that the registered admin contact email is current and working. There is typically a transfer domain lock mechanism within the administration interface at the registrar, which must be unlocked for a successful transfer. Registry operators may have their own provisions in agreements with registrars; those agreements may be posted on operators' websites. Registrars may also use additional Transaction Auth Codes, e.g. to validate transactions such as allowing a domain to be pushed into one account from another account, within the registrar.

The label's roster included Mantronix, Just-Ice, Nice & Smooth, T La Rock, EPMD and Stezo; freestyle vocalists Nocera and Kariya (\\"Let Me Love You for Tonight\\"); and R&B; singer-songwriter Joyce Sims.  History  Sleeping Bag Records was founded by avant-garde cellist, composer, and underground disco artist Arthur Russell and William \\"Will\\" Socolov. In 1983, Juggy Gayles began promoting singles for the company. Later, he became a partner. The label's corporate logo was a drawing of a koala. Sub-label Fresh Records was founded in 1985. Kurtis Mantronik, in addition to being the musician of the hip-hop duo Mantronix, worked for the label in an A&R; capacity. After folding in 1992, the Sleeping Bag catalog sat in limbo for several years. In 1996, the label and its catalog were purchased by Warlock Records, which has since been re-releasing its titles with the Sleeping Bag and Fresh logos alongside the Warlock Records logo. The building in Manhattan where the label had its headquarters was torn down in the 1990s, and a luxury apartment building now stands in its place. In 2006, the label became one of many imprints‚Äô catalogs that became Traffic Entertainment Group, which has been releasing new versions of the classic albums in Sleeping Bag‚Äôs catalog with their original artwork intact.  In popular culture  * EPMD rhymed about its record-signing experience with sub-label Fresh Records in the song \\"Please Listen to My Demo\\" from its 1989 Unfinished Business album. * Label partner Juggy Gayles was crank-called by the Jerky Boys on \\"The Hucklebuck\\" track from 1999's Stop Staring at Me! album.

Durcovici was a victim of Romania's Communist regime, under which he was imprisoned; he died while in jail. He was known for being a zealous bishop who visited each parish within the confines of his diocese and known for his efforts in preaching the Gospel to all that he could. He likewise was known for his staunch commitment to the values of the Gospel and for his allegiance to the Church which led to his false arrest and imprisonment at the hands of the communist regime. Durcovici was a professor of seminarians and taught his students subjects such as canon law. His zeal as a priest led to his appointment in Bucharest as a rector for seminarians and his renown in Romania led to his episcopal appointment as a bishop. The beatification process for the late bishop commenced in the 1990s and culminated in 2013 after Pope Francis approved his beatification; Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the 2014 beatification on the pope's behalf in Durcovici's old diocese. Life =Childhood and education= Anton Durcovici was born on 17 May 1888 as the second of two children in Bad Deutsch Altenburg to Franz Durcovici (1858-05.02.1893) and Maria Mittermeier; he was baptized in the Assumption church on the following 21 May. He left for the Romanian Kingdom together with his widowed mother and his brother Franz; the three settled in Ia≈üi in 1895. His father had died from acute tuberculosis in 1893. His father contracted this as a result of his time as a soldier back in the 1878 Bosnian campaign. His mother sought work as a washerwoman and as a seamstress. His mother's aunt named √ñsterreicher (who became widowed in 1895) lived in Ia≈üi where she owned a restaurant. In 1894 she invited her niece to help her with her work so she moved herself and her two children there. In 1895 he began school and learnt the Romanian language. From 1896 to 1898 he lived in Ploie≈üti where he and his brother attended school and in 1898 relocated to 81 Izvor Street in the nation's capital. From 1898 Durcovici attended the S. Andrei high school (1898‚Äì1901) that the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Bucharest managed and it was there that he met the Benedictine monk Lucius Fetz who became impressed with Durcovici and his academic results. He attended the S. Iosif school from 1901 to 1906. On 25 May 1899 he received his Confirmation from the Archbishop of Bucharest Francisc Xaveriu Hornstein. He became an altar server at this time and attended morning Mass before being given a snack and sent to school. It was not long until Fetz interceded to the Archbishop of Bucharest who admitted him to ecclesial studies on 1 September 1901. On 23 October 1906 he received his diploma from Fr. Augustin Kuczka after passing his baccalaureate which listed subjects such as Greek and mathematics. He mastered the Romanian and Greek languages but also studied Hungarian in addition to the traditional Italian language and Latin; he also studied the French language. It was later in 1906 that he continued his studies in Rome (at the behest of the Archbishop of Bucharest) where he attended the Saint Thomas pontifical college and the Propaganda Fide college where he earned degrees in canon law as well as in philosophical and theological studies; this included two doctorates. From 1910 to 1911 he served as the prefect of studies at the Propaganda Fide college. He used the week before starting his studies in Rome to explore both Rome and Saint Peter's Basilica before beginning his studies on 4 November 1906. In 1910 he was given a Doctor Divinitatis while he obtained a canon law degree in 1911 from the Pontifical Gregorian. His ordination was postponed due to his age since Durcovici had not reached the required age needed for ordination. But signs seemed to change since Cardinal Girolamo Maria Gotti and the college rector Monsignor Giovanni Bonzano demonstrated signs that both were impressed with Durcovici and his work ethic. This led to a 20-month age waiver being granted to him which would allow for him to be ordained. =Priesthood= Durcovisi received his ordination to the priesthood on 24 September 1910 from Cardinal Pietro Respighi in the Lateran Basilica. On 29 July 1911 he left Rome to return home but before this went on a pilgrimage to Loreto and then travelled onwards to Austria where he celebrated his first Mass in his native village alongside his mother and brother. He returned to Romania on 11 August 1911 where he was appointed as a schoolteacher for seminarians in Bucharest and then as a parish administrator in Tulcea. Durcovici was made a professor of religious education at the S. Iosif high school. Romania's entrance into World War I on the Allied side saw him sent to an internment camp in Moldovia ‚Äì being an Austrian citizen ‚Äì, until being freed on the orders of King Ferdinand I. From 1918 to 1922 he taught students in addition to ministering in the Giurgiu parish and it was around this time that he founded the \\"Unio Apostolica Cleri\\" to promote vocations and brotherhood among priests. In 1931 King Charles II granted him the Order of the Star of Romania. Durcovici became the rector to seminarians in Bucharest in 1924 and held the office until April 1948 following his episcopal appointment. =Episcopate= Pope Pius XII appointed Durcovici as the Bishop of Ia≈üi in October 1947 and he received his episcopal consecration on 5 April 1948 from the nation's apostolic nuncio. The co-consecrators were Alexandry Theodor Cisar and Marco Glaser. His episcopal ordination had been postponed for five months ‚Äì it should have been celebrated in November 1947 ‚Äì but the communists were opposed to his nomination though soon relented. His consecration took place in the Saint Joseph Cathedral in Bucharest. He had become an opponent of the post-World War II communist regime who attempted to have him accept a decrease in papal control over Romanian Catholics. Durcovici was placed under surveillance in 1947 and the communists kept a dossier on him (number 84569) and hoped to indict him on some sort of charge. The authorities collected 57 statements from peasants from thirteen villages who were dissatisfied with Durcovici due to his refusal to introduce the Hungarian language into the churches. This enabled the communists to fabricate charges against him. The Securitate soon arrested him (and his colleague Fr. Raffael Friedrich) on 26 June 1949 while he was visiting the congregation of Pope»ôti- Leordeni. He was arrested in the streets while he was going to impart the Confirmation sacrament at a parish near the capital which saw him beaten as he was forced into a waiting car. =Imprisonment and death= He was held in Jilava from June 1949 to 10 September 1951 and then transferred to Sighet prison together with his fellow bishop √Åron M√°rton and Alexandru Cisar; he was the target of torture and deprivations. He was put into Cell 13 with no light and heat. In mid-November 1951 he was moved to isolation so he could die alone and so his death would be unknown to others. He was also stripped naked and exposed to the winter weather as well as being denied food and water which led to his death in his cell in the evening on 10 December 1951 as a result of the mistreatment and malnutrition. He was buried in an unmarked grave. Witness accounts state that Durcovici received final absolution through a cell door from a fellow priest prisoner. The communist authorities attempted to erase all evidence of his time in prison and most documents were all removed so as to hide his imprisonment. Beatification The beatification process was launched under Pope John Paul II on 28 January 1997 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Durcovici as a Servant of God and issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) edict that would allow for the cause to commence. The diocesan investigation was launched in Durcovici's old diocese on 25 March 1997 and was later closed on 11 September 1999 after the investigation concluded its assigned work. The C.C.S. later validated the investigation in Rome on 29 October 2010 while receiving the Positio dossier from the postulation from assessment in 2012. Theologians confirmed the cause on 22 February 2013 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 24 September 2013. Pope Francis confirmed on 31 October 2013 that Durcovici had died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) and confirmed that Durcovici would be beatified. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the pope's behalf in Romania on 17 May 2014. The apostolic nuncio Francisco- Javier Lozano Sebast√≠an and the Archbishop of Bucharest Ioan Robu both attended the beatification as did 23 thousand people. Cardinal Amato referred to Durcovici in his address as having possessed a \\"merciful temperament\\" while Pope Francis ‚Äì in the beatification apostolic letter ‚Äì referred to him as a \\"zealous priest\\". The Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta released a statement for the beatification calling for the unification of all Romanian people irrespective of faith. He issued the statement in light of the beatification which he hoped would inspire unification of all peoples. The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Isidor Iacovici.

Since the end of the 19th century it has been one of the most famous and busiest shopping streets in Germany. Before World War II it was also known for its grand buildings, but most of them were destroyed and not rebuilt. The western part of the Zeil is a pedestrian zone between two large plazas, Hauptwache in the west and Konstablerwache in the east. These two plazas serve as major intersections for underground trains, trams and buses. The eastern part of the Zeil, called \\"New Zeil\\", connects Konstablerwache with the Friedberger Anlage. The Zeil underwent a major renovation from spring 2008 until summer 2009. The pedestrian zone was extended to the west as far as the B√∂rsenstra√üe. This brought drastic changes for motorists because the route via Hauptwache, which is an important north-south connection for individual traffic, was closed.

They were the remnants of the medieval free nobility (edelfrei) and the ministeriales. What distinguished them from other knights, who were vassals of a higher lord, was the fact that they had been granted Imperial immediacy, and as such were the equals in most respects to the other individuals or entities, such as the secular and ecclesiastical territorial rulers of the Empire (margraves, dukes, princes, counts, archbishops, bishops, abbots, etc.) and the Free Imperial cities, that also enjoyed Imperial immediacy. However, unlike all of those, the Imperial knights did not possess the status of Estates (St√§nde) of the Empire, and therefore were not represented, individually or collectively, in the Imperial Diet.Gagliardo, J. G., Reich and Nation: the Holy Roman Empire as Idea and Reality, 1763-1806, Indiana University Press, 1980, p. 12-13They tended to define their responsibilities to the Empire in terms of feudalized obligations to the Emperor, including personal service and strictly voluntary financial offerings paid to the Emperor himself.Gagliardo, p. 13 To protect their rights and avoid vassalage to more powerful nobles, they organized themselves into three unions (Partheien) in the late 15th century and into a single body in 1577, and fought to win recognition. This status, beholden only to the Emperor himself rather than through a more powerful noble, meant the Imperial Knights were \\"immediate subjects\\" (their fealty was unmediated by another lord). As such, the Imperial Knights exercised a limited form of sovereignty within their territories. The Imperial Knighthood was a regional phenomenon limited to southwestern and south-central Germany‚ÄîSwabia, Franconia and the Middle Rhine area‚Äîzones which were highly fragmented politically and where no powerful states were able to develop. In northern and northeastern Germany, as well as in Bavaria and the Archduchy of Austria, the local nobles, facing larger states and stronger rulers, were incapable of developing and maintaining their independence. They formed the territorial nobility.Hillay Zmora, \\"The Formation of the Imperial Knighthood in Franconia: A Comparative European Perspective\\", in The Holy Roman Empire, 1495‚Äì1806, Edited by R. J. W. Evans, Michael Schaich, and Peter H. Wilson, Oxford, 2011, p. 283‚Äì284. The immediate status of the Imperial Knights was recognized at the Peace of Westphalia. They never gained access to the Imperial Diet, the parliament of lords, and were not considered Hochadel, the high nobility, belonging to the Lower Nobility.  History  = Origins = The Free Imperial Knights arose in the 14th century, the fusion of the remnants of the old free lords (Edelfrei) and the stronger elements of the unfree ministeriales that had won noble status. Around 1300, the manorial economy suffered contraction due to the fluctuation in the price of agricultural foodstuffs. Ministeriales who were in a stronger economic position were better able to survive the weakening of their basis as landowners. The vast majority languished in poverty, resorting to selling lands to the Church, or to brigandage. The minority of ministeriales rich enough to weather the crises soon came to be identified with the remnants of the free nobility, and were thus seen as constituting one noble order. By 1422, some of these nobles had achieved jurisdictional autonomy under the Emperor (‚Äòimmediacy‚Äô), and the corporation of free imperial knights was born. The other ministeriales that did not manage to receive the status of immediate vassals of the Emperor were gradually transformed into a titled nobility of free status: the Freiherren (Barons). By 1577, the Imperial Knights achieved the status of a noble corporate body within the empire: the corpus equestre. In the Peace of Westphalia, the privileges of the Imperial Knights were confirmed. The knights paid their own tax (voluntary) to the Emperor, possessed limited sovereignty (rights of legislation, taxation, civil jurisdiction, police, coin, tariff, hunt; certain forms of justice), and the ius reformandi (the right to establish an official Christian denomination in their territories). The knightly families had the right of house legislation, subject to the Emperor's approval, and so could control such things as the marriage of members and set the terms of the inheritance of family property. Imperial knights did not, however, have access to the Imperial Diet. Concerning the rights of Free Imperial Knights, Joseph Friederich von Ledersheim wrote in 1715 (De jure et privilegiis nobilium liberorum et immediatorum, Von des H. R√∂m. Reichs Freyen unmittelbahren Ritterschafft Discursus): Section XII: ‚Äú‚Ä¶they possess forestry rights (ius forestae)‚Ä¶the right of hunting (ius venandi); the right to establish an archive (ius archivi, a right of sovereignty); the capacity to make laws (facultatem leges atque statuas condendi); to send ambassadors (ius mittendi legatos) not only to the Emperor but to other kings and princes and those of whatever status; the right to establish pacts (ius constituendi foederae), of conducting war (bellum movendi), of constructing fortifications and walling forts (fortalitia extruendi et arces muniendi); without the need for permission they are able to call and hold assizes‚Ä¶.they acknowledge no court but that of the Emperor, even though they hold no fiefs of the Emperor; the privilege against new fiefs being erected, the right to arbitration (ius Austregarum) no less than other states of the Empire have, even if they hold certain mediate fiefs from another prince.‚Äù Section XV: ‚Äúthey enjoy the freedom of religion (pace religionis fruuntur) and therefore of establishing the Protestant Religion in churches and schools not only in their own hereditary territories but also in those fiefs held from another state‚Ä¶they are able whenever they wish to abolish and introduce either religion [Catholic or Protestant] if they hold the position of vogt over the possessions.‚Äù All matters relating to the Imperial Knights' legal status as immediate vassals of the Emperor (house laws, debt, etc.) were managed by the Imperial Aulic Council. = Organization = Estates of Imperial Knights (Mainz) Lacking access to the Imperial Diet, in 1650 the immediate knights organized themselves into three circles (Ritterkreise): the Franconian, Swabian, and Rhenish Circles. The Circles in turn were divided into cantons (Ritterkantone), each of which exercised a high degree of autonomy. Each canon possessed a directorate (Direktorium), led by a director (Ritterhauptmann), who was elected by life, and a council (Ritterr√§te), whose members were elected for fixed terms. The director and councilors were knights themselves, but the daily activities of the Direktorium were carried out by legal experts (Konsulenten) and committees (Aussch√ºsse) staffed by non-nobles.Klaus Epstein, The Genesis of German Conservatism (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1966), 617‚Äì18. The Knights as a group were governed by the General Directorate (Generaldirektorium). This exercised the jus retractus, the right to buy back any land sold to a non-knight for the original price within three years, and the just collectandi, the right to collect taxes for the upkeep of the knightly order, even on estates that had been sold to non-knights. The knights also had the right to tax their subjects directly, and also possessed the feudal rights to the corv√©e and the bannum. The knights' reputation for heavy taxes (the maligned Rittersteuer) and high judicial fines rendered them an anachronism in the eyes of imperial reformers. From 1577 on, the Imperial Knights met in a congress called the Generalkorrespondenztag (\\"General Correspondence Diet\\"), but the Circles and especially the Cantons became somewhat more important as their proximity meant that their interests were more closely aligned. Some immediate imperial fiefs, however, fell outside the structure of the Circles and their Cantons. The autonomous barony (Freiherrschaft) of Haldenstein (in modern-day Switzerland) is an example. By the late eighteenth century, the organization of the circles was as following: The Franconian Circle from Des heiligen R√∂mischen Reichs ohnmittelbahr = Freyer Ritterschafft Der Sechs Ort in Francken, 1720 Franconian Circle (six cantons) * Odenwald (seat: Kochendorf near Heilbronn) * Steigerwald (seat: Erlangen) * Altm√ºhl (seat: Wilhermsdorf near Emskirchen) * Baunach (seat: Nuremberg) * Rh√∂n-Werra (seat: Schweinfurt) * Geb√ºrg (seat: Bamberg) Swabian Circle (five cantons) * Danube (seat: Ehingen) * Hegau-Allg√§u-Bodensee (seat: Radolfzell) * Kocher (seat: Esslingen) * Kraichgau (seat: Heilbronn) * Neckar- Schwarzwald (seat: T√ºbingen) (Note: The semi-autonomous District Ortenau was affiliated with canton Neckar-Schwarzwald. District Ortenau served as the chief organizational connection to the empire for the Alsatian immediate nobility that had been absorbed by the French reunions of the seventeenth century.) Rhenish Circle (three cantons) * Upper Rhine (seat: Mainz) * Middle Rhine (seat: Friedberg) * Lower Rhine (seat: Koblenz) = Immediate and mediate status = Whether or not an individual, an institution, or an area was directly subject to the Emperor's authority defined the status of ‚Äòimmediate‚Äô and ‚Äòmediate‚Äô subject of the Empire (reichsunmittelbar, reichsmittelbar). The distinction was not restricted to noble subjects of the Emperor; for example, a number of high officials in the imperial courts and the chancery were immediate, whether noble or not. Arising from the feudal connection between tenure of land and jurisdiction, the status of immediate subject was further distinct from that of a state of the Empire. There were many immediate territories that were not states of the Empire, and there could be states that were not immediate. Examples of tiny immediate territories include villages (Gochsheim and Sennfeld near Schweinfurt), and some farms in Upper Swabia. The status of immediate subject of the Emperor could be held by an institution: the family of Thurn und Taxis held the imperial post as an immediate fief from the Emperor. Mediate entities were subjects arranged under an intermediate jurisdiction between the entity itself and the Emperor. = Role in the Empire = The Imperial Knights were called very often to war by the emperor and therefore won significant influence in the Military and the Administration of the Empire and also over the more powerful nobles. Every Canton had its own Ritterhauptmann or Captain and kept detailed records of noble families and properties. The Imperial Knights were exempt from imperial taxes and were not required to quarter troops. After the Protestant Reformation, most Imperial Knights remained Catholic and their families made up a substantial fraction of noble Catholics in much of the Empire outside Austria and Bavaria. This eventually led to the Imperial Knights exerting significant influence in the selection of several prince-bishops and prince- archbishops, giving them some influence in the Imperial Diet and the College of Princes. = Decline = Over time the title of Imperial Knight became a title of nobility rather than occupation. Many Imperial Knights even as early as the 16th century are more famous for their scholarly, artistic, or diplomatic work than their military achievements. During the demise of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803, the Knights' estates, which were generally enclaves, were seized by the great territorial states like Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg in the so-called Rittersturm. In 1806, the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine gave the great states unilateral powers and the Imperial Knights' possessions, hitherto completely independent under the Emperor, formally became part of the territories of the higher rulers, by whose territory they were surrounded. They, for the most part, took the title of Freiherr and submitted themselves to their new lords. = Numbers and membership = Estates of Imperial Knights (Fulda) Exact numbers of Free Imperial Knights are difficult to assess. It is often stated that there were 350 knightly families in all three Circles, owning around 1,500 estates (around 200 German square miles, or about 4,400 English square miles), with a total population of 350,000‚Äì450,000 inhabitants. These figures, however, are drawn from claims for compensation made after the upheavals of the French Revolution, and are more accurate for their description of geographical extent than of the total membership in the order. There were at least 400 families possessing land and many more of knightly rank that did not possess land, the so-called Personalisten. With these latter included, the total number of knightly families rises to perhaps as high as 500. The discrepancies in the numbers stem from the list of membership for the Lower Rhenish canton being incomplete and from the absence of Personalisten from the claims of compensation.Godsey (2004), p. 8 From early on, the membership of the corporation of Imperial Knights controlled access to admission to its Circles and Cantons. There were two kinds of membership possible within the order: personal and landed. Landed members were families enrolled in a Circle and Canton who owned an immediate fief, and thus were subordinate to the Emperor directly. The personal members (Personalisten) were non-landed members ‚Äì regularly admitted ‚Äì who had not yet acquired estates under knightly jurisdiction. As a result, the Personalisten were not included in claims made for compensation. Consequently, the numbers of landed families were probably closer to 400, with the Personalisten adding another 100, bringing the total number of knightly families to around 500 at the time of the corporation's dissolution.

In 2011 & 2019, he coached the Finnish national team to win the gold medal in the IIHF World Championship. He was the head coach of Jokerit in the Kontinental Hockey League during seasons 2016-2018 before returning to coach the Finnish national team. Playing career During his playing career, Jalonen appeared in two SM-liiga games for JyP HT in the 1985‚Äì86 season. He also played for JYP, J√§√§ahmat and Lohi in lower divisions. Coaching career Jalonen started his coaching career with SM-Liiga sides, managing Ilves from 1992 to 1995, and Lukko during the 1996‚Äì97 season. Afterwards, he took over Mestis side Vaasan Sport for the 1997‚Äì98 season. After a one-year stint with Sport, Jalonen spent three seasons abroad. First, he coached HC Alleghe in Italy and then two seasons in the United Kingdom, with the Newcastle RiverKings and Newcastle Jesters in the British Ice Hockey Superleague, respectively. For the 2001‚Äì02 season, Jalonen returned to Finland and signed with HPK. He went on to spend six seasons with HPK, and led the team to remarkable success with placing third in the SM-liiga in 2001‚Äì02, 2002‚Äì03 and 2004‚Äì05. His era in H√§meenlinna reached a climax in 2005‚Äì06, when he led HPK to win the first Kanada-malja in the franchise history. The same year, he was awarded with the Kalevi Numminen trophy for being the best coach in the league. In his last season with HPK in 2006‚Äì07, Jalonen added yet another SM-liiga bronze medal to his record. After his years in HPK, Jalonen started coaching the Finnish national team, first in the role of an assistant coach under Doug Shedden in 2007‚Äì08, and then as the head coach from 2008-09 onward. In 2010, Jalonen's team won the Olympic bronze medal in Vancouver, and in 2011 he coached the Finnish national team to the nation's all-time second World Championship title. In the final game, Finland beat arch rivals Sweden with a score 6‚Äì1. While Jalonen remained as the head coach of the national team until the end of 2012‚Äì13 season, the national team failed to win additional medals under his tenure . During the 2012‚Äì13 season Jalonen signed with KHL side SKA St. Petersburg, replacing Milos Riha during the season. He went on to lead the team to conference finals in the Gagarin Cup. He stayed with SKA the following season, 2013‚Äì14, but the team's run ended in a loss in conference semi-finals. For the 2016 World Juniors that were organised in Finland, Jalonen was hired to coach the Finnish U20 team. He successfully coached the Finnish team to World Junior Championship on home ice, beating Russia with a score 4-3 (OT) in the final at Hartwall Arena. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, Jalonen returned to the KHL with the Jokerit. Jokerit made the playoffs but were knocked out in the first round of the Gagarin Cup. In 2017 Jalonen was re-elected Finnish national team as head coach to replace Lauri Marjam√§ki after the 2018 World Championship.

An Artist of the End of Utopia\\", A. Turowski, M. ≈ölizi≈Ñska, Poland, Lodz 2014 was a Polish avant-garde artist, painter, sculptor, scenographer, and architect. Personal life Teresa ≈ªarnower√≥wna was born in Targ√≥wek, Warsaw in either 1895 or 1897 (sources cannot agree) in a Polonized (assimilated) Jewish family. She had a brother, David ≈ªarnower. She had an affair with a fellow artist and mountaineer Mieczys≈Çaw Szczuka until his death in 1927. In 1937, she left Poland to live in Paris, Spain, Portugal, and Canada, and eventually arrived in the US, where she would remain until her early death. She died 30 April 1949 at her apartment on 15 West 67th Street. The New York Times reported she \\"died unexpectedly\\" at age 48. It is said that she died soon after receiving a letter from her brother, who wrote that he had survived World War II and was in Russia. In her New York flat, a letter was found at her side, of which she had managed to write only one sentence: \\"The joy that you are alive will probably kill me...\\" However, this is unconfirmed. Other sources suggest that she committed suicide after many years of loneliness and financial hardship.Teresa ≈ªarnower√≥wna Artistic style and career ≈ªarnower√≥wna is known for being a very versatile artist. She created sculptures and geometric abstract compositions painted on canvas or made in the form of color linocuts and drawings. She produced photo-montages, book covers, typography designs and propaganda posters, and participated in architectural projects. Her work was generally influenced by Russian Constructivism and the Dutch De Stijl movement. Her early paintings have been lost, but according to surviving descriptions, they depicted geometric, typographic compositions composed of diagonal lines, which introduced dynamism. Similarly, her abstract sculptures designed on the basis of the opposition between concave and convex planes have not been preserved. What works that were preserved can be found in the Museum of Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. From 1915 to 1920, ≈ªarnower√≥wna studied at the Warsaw School of Fine Arts in Edward Wittig's sculpture studio. There she met Henryk Sta≈ºewski, Maria ≈Åucja Nicz-Borowiakowa, and Szczuka. The four of them would later constitute the core of the Polish Constructivist avant-garde during the inter-war period, and she is considered a pioneer in the field. Originally, she focused on sculpture. In 1920, her diploma work Akt won a prize in a sculpture competition organized by the Ministry of Art and Culture. In 1921, she made her debut in the Spring Salon of the (Society for Fine Arts Promotion) in Warsaw. She collaborated with Szczuka, and together they displayed their works at the 1923 Wystawa Nowej Sztuki (Exhibition of New Art) in Vilnius, and in Berlin's Der Sturm gallery. During the same time period she created Spatial Construction Sketch, which was followed by the Typography Compositions and New Compositions series in 1924. After 1924, she became less interested in painting and sculpture and turned her attention to socially useful art, such as typography, graphics, book and newspaper design, posters, photomontages, and architectural design. Szczuka and ≈ªarnower√≥wna were the only artists to engage in political photomontage in Poland at the time. In 1926, she participated in the International Exhibition of Modern Art in Bucharest and in the First International Exhibition of Architecture in Warsaw, where she showed her projects of modern co-operative blocks of apartments, prepared together with Szczuka. While none of these projects were ever built, they became part of the history of Polish avant-garde architecture. One of them called Garden Homes in Garden Cities (1927) was an interesting reference to Le Corbusier's idea of linking architecture with its environment. Szczuka and ≈ªarnower√≥wna were co-creators of the \\"Grupa Kubist√≥w, Konstruktywist√≥w i Suprematyst√≥w Blok\\" (Cubists, Constructivists, and Suprematists group), the first Polish constructivist artistic group in Warsaw. ≈ªarnower√≥wna co-edited the group's magazine, Blok, Czasopismo Awangardy Artystycznej (Blok, The Magazine of Artistic Avant-garde), as well as Szczuka's magazine, D≈∫wignia (The Lever), from his death until July 1928. Both magazines serve as the primary source of information about her work as most of her original works are lost. Blok disbanded in 1926 due to artistic differences amongst its members. After Szczuka's death in 1927, ≈ªarnower√≥wna completed many of his works, including the cover for Anatol Stern's (1899‚Äì1968) poem Europa in 1929. During her time in the U.S., she had a solo exhibit, called 16 Gouaches, at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century Gallery in 1946. This particular exhibition was recently partially reconstructed by the Museum of Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Shortly thereafter she took part in The Jewish Museum's inaugural exhibition in 1947.  Political art and views  ≈ªarnower√≥wna had left-wing views, and many of her posters, print designs, and photomontages were a mixture of political propaganda and avant-garde art. Through her brother David, a doctor and an avid member of the Polish Communist Party, she was acquainted with Marxist ideology and became involved in the revolutionary movements taking place during the inter-war period. In 1928, she designed a whole series of election posters for the left-wing Workers and Peasants Unity party along with party leaflets. She also designed the graphic layout of a number of magazines: The Forge, a Worker Youth Monthly (1927), Literary Monthly (1929), and the publication of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist International section, Czerwony Sztandar (The Red Banner, 1931). In 1931 she signed the manifesto against torture of political prisoners. However, shortly thereafter ≈ªarnower√≥wna ceased her artistic activities. It was not until many years later, influenced by news from Europe during World War II, that she returned to art while living in New York. In 1942, she created a cycle of photo- montages for the book The Defense of Warsaw and later worked on a monumental bias-relief sculpture devoted to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising (it was never completed).

The Meyer-Schuster rearrangement When catalyzed by base, the reaction is called the Favorskii reaction. Mechanism Meyer-Schuster Rearrangement The reaction mechanismLi, J.J. In Meyer-Schuster rearrangement; Name Reactions: A Collection of Detailed Reaction Mechanisms; Springer: Berlin, 2006; pp 380‚Äì381.() begins with the protonation of the alcohol which leaves in an E1 reaction to form the allene from the alkyne. Attack of a water molecule on the carbocation and deprotonation is followed by tautomerization to give the Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Edens et al. have investigated the reaction mechanism.Edens, M.; Boerner, D.; Chase, C. R.; Nass, D.; Schiavelli, M. D. J. Org. Chem. 1977, 42, 3403‚Äì3408. () They found it was characterized by three major steps: (1) the rapid protonation of oxygen, (2) the slow, rate- determining step comprising the 1,3-shift of the protonated hydroxy group, and (3) the keto-enol tautomerism followed by rapid deprotonation. In a study of the rate-limiting step of the Meyer‚ÄìSchuster reaction, Andres et al. showed that the driving force of the reaction is the irreversible formation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds through carbonium ions.Andres, J.; Cardenas, R.; Silla, E.; Tapia, O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110, 666‚Äì674. () They also found the reaction to be assisted by the solvent. This was further investigated by Tapia et al. who showed solvent caging stabilizes the transition state.Tapia, O.; Lluch, J.M.; Cardena, R.; Andres, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 829‚Äì835.

Helv. Chim. Acta 1926, 9, 672. ()Li, J.J. In Rupe rearrangement; Name Reactions: A Collection of Detailed Reaction Mechanisms; Springer: Berlin, 2006; pp 513‚Äì514.() This alternate reaction is called the Rupe reaction, and competes with the Meyer‚ÄìSchuster rearrangement in the case of tertiary alcohols. The Rupe rearrangement Mechanism of the Rupe rearrangement Use of catalysts While the traditional Meyer‚ÄìSchuster rearrangement uses harsh conditions with a strong acid as the catalyst, this introduces competition with the Rupe reaction if the alcohol is tertiary. Milder conditions have been used successfully with transition metal-based and Lewis acid catalysts (for example, Ru-Cadierno, V.; Crochet, P.; Gimeno, J. Synlett 2008, 1105‚Äì1124.

This method of booting can be used by routers, diskless workstations and centrally managed computers (thin clients) such as public computers at libraries and schools. Network booting can be used to centralize management of disk storage, which supporters claim can result in reduced capital and maintenance costs. It can also be used in cluster computing, in which nodes may not have local disks. In the late 1980s/early 1990s, network boot was used to save the expense of a disk drive, because a decently sized harddisk would still cost thousands of dollars, often equaling the price of the CPU. Hardware support Contemporary desktop personal computers generally provide an option to boot from the network in their BIOS via the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE). Post-1998 PowerPC (G3 G5) Mac systems can also boot from their firmware to a network disk via NetBoot. Old personal computers without network boot firmware support can utilize a floppy disk or flash drive containing software to boot from the network. Process The initial software to be run is loaded from a server on the network; for IP networks this is usually done using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). The server from which to load the initial software is usually found by broadcasting a Bootstrap Protocol or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) request. Typically, this initial software is not a full image of the operating system to be loaded, but a small network boot manager program such as PXELINUX which can deploy a boot option menu and then load the full image by invoking the corresponding second-stage bootloader. Installations Netbooting is also used for unattended operating system installations. In this case, a network-booted helper operating system is used as a platform to execute the script-driven, unattended installation of the intended operating system on the target machine. Implementations of this for Mac OS X and Windows exist as NetInstall and Windows Deployment Services, respectively. Legacy Before IP became the primary Layer 3 protocol, Novell's NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) and IBM's Remote Initial Program Load (RIPL) were widely used for network booting. Their client implementations also fit into smaller ROM than PXE. Technically network booting can be implemented over any of file transfer or resource sharing protocols, for example, NFS is preferred by BSD variants.

O'Meara was indicted on 32 counts of conspiracy, wire and mail fraud in connection with the failed Running Horse development. , Department of Justice Press Release, August 4, 2010 The indictment alleged: * Based on representations made to them by O'Meara, Jack Nicklaus and members of the Nicklaus Design team appeared at a press conference in January 2006 at the proposed Running Horse golf course and, relying on O'Meara's representations, the PGA Tour publicly scheduled a PGA Tour event called \\"The Running Horse Classic\\" that was to have taken place in October 2007 with a purse of $4,500,000. * O'Meara spent all money loaned to him by commercial investors and eventually defaulted on $10,000,000 in commercial loans, began marketing the Running Horse development as an investment opportunity, and solicited over $16,000,000 in private investor funds at a time when O'Meara knew, but failed to disclose, that the project was in poor financial condition and faced numerous, substantial obstacles to completion. * O'Meara diverted some private investors' funds for his own personal gain. * O'Meara and others acting on his behalf falsely stated that: the development had acquired all property necessary to complete the golf course and adjoining residential development; the golf course was close to completion; investors' principal was guaranteed and they would receive high rates of return on their investments; and, that Jack Nicklaus Design and the PGA Tour were confident that the golf course would be completed in time to host the Running Horse Classic in 2007. * The Running Horse development ultimately failed, and commercial and private investors lost their investments. * No residential units were ever built in the development, and the on which the Running Horse Golf and Country Club was to have been located remained largely undeveloped at the time of the indictment.

Fearing that the Sultan would make use of the Serbs to oust them, they decided to execute leading Serbs throughout the Sanjak. A total of 72 noble Serbs were assassinated, and their heads were put on public display. Notable victims were Aleksa Nenadoviƒá and Ilija Birƒçanin. The event triggered the First Serbian Uprising, aimed at putting an end to the centuries of Ottoman occupation. Background In 1788, Koƒça's frontier rebellion saw most of ≈†umadija occupied by the Serbian Free Corps, a volunteer militia loyal to the Austrians. Belgrade was besieged by Austrian forces in late 1789, occupied until 1791 when it was handed back to the Ottomans after concluding peace. In 1793 and 1796 Sultan Selim III proclaimed firmans (decrees) which gave more rights to Serbs. Among other things, taxes were to be collected by the obor- knez; freedom of trade and religion were granted and there was peace. Each village had a knez and 10 villages had an obor-knez. Selim III also decreed that some unpopular Janissaries were to leave the Sanjak of Smederevo (also known as the \\"Belgrade Pashaluk\\") as he saw them as a threat to the central authority of Had≈æi Mustafa Pasha, the governor. Many of those Janissaries were employed by or found refuge with Osman Pazvantoƒülu, a renegade opponent of Selim III in the Sanjak of Vidin. Fearing the dissolution of the Janissary command in the Sanjak of Smederevo, Osman Pazvantoƒülu launched a series of raids against Serbians without the permission of Selim III, causing much volatility and fear in the region. Pazvantoƒülu was defeated in 1793 by a Serbian contingent at the Battle of Kolari. In the summer of 1797 the sultan appointed Mustafa Pasha on position of beglerbeg of Rumelia Eyalet and he left Serbia for Plovdiv to fight against Pazvantoƒülu and his rebels. During the absence of Mustafa Pasha, the forces of Pazvantoƒülu captured Po≈æarevac and besieged the Belgrade fortress. Mustafa Pasha planned to raise taxes in order to pay for the operations against the Janissary rebels, however, he was persuaded by the Serbian knezes to rely on them on mustering a force of the local population. The Serbians were able to collect 10,000 fighters. At the end of November 1797 obor-knezes Aleksa Nenadoviƒá, Ilija Birƒçanin and Nikola Grboviƒá from Valjevo brought their forces to Belgrade and forced the besieging Janissary forces to retreat to Smederevo. By 1799 the Janissary corps had returned, as they were pardoned by the Sultan's decree, and they immediately suspended the Serbian autonomy and drastically increased taxes, enforcing martial law in Serbia. On 15 December 1801 Mustafa Pasha was assassinated by Kuchuk Alija, one of four Dahije (the renegade Jannissary leaders in the Sanjak of Smederevo). The Dahije henceforth ruled the Sanjak independently of, and in defiance to the sultan. Had≈æi-√êera and Had≈æi-Ruvim with conspirators. The tyranny endured by the Serbs caused them to send a petition to the Sultan, which the Dahije learnt of. According to Leopold von Ranke, the Dahije started to fear that the Sultan would make use of the Serbs to oust them; to forestall this they decided to execute leading Serbs throughout the sanjak. In fact, the Dahije learnt of a conspiracy between the Serbians and Mustafa Pasha's associates (who wanted revenge) to rise against the Dahije, forged in 1803. A letter to an Austrian officer inviting for conflict, most likely written by Had≈æi-Ruvim, was intercepted. History Serb knez beheaded. The Dahije sent secret orders to their muteselims to kill each of their knez on the given day. It seems that Mehmed-aga Foƒçiƒá was tasked with overseeing the operation. The victims were obor-knezes, knezes, buljuba≈°as and other chosen people. Most of the knezes were killed on 23 January, while Had≈æi-Ruvim was killed on 29 January. By 25 January, the Dahije decided that noble Serbs were to be beaten, so that what was left would become real \\"rayah, to serve the Turks well\\". Other Ottoman lords then began to attack chosen nobles in their districts. Karaƒëorƒëe survived attempts. According to contemporary accounts, heads were put on public display at the Valjevo town square to serve as an example to those who might plot against the rule of the Dahije. By 4 February, 72 decapitated heads were brought to Belgrade. List of victims Memorial in Valjevo. *Stevan Andrejeviƒá Palalija, knez of Begaljica in the Grocka nahiya.

Biography Edward was born on 6 December 1765. O'Reilly's grandfather was Eoghan O'Reilly of Corstown, County Meath.Dictionary of Irish Biography Edward's father moved to Harold's Cross, Dublin, where he practised as an apothecary. The History of the City of Dublin, Vol. II, p. 934, by John Warburton (1818) states- \\"Edward O'Reilly was educated in Dublin, where he had never heard Irish spoken. He applied himself to the study of the language by accident. In the year 1794 a young man of the name of Wright, who was about to emigrate from his native country, had a number of books to dispose of, which chiefly consisted of Irish MSS. They had been collected by the industry of a man of the name of Morris O'Gorman, who was clerk to Mary's-lane Chapel, and the person from whom Dr. Young, Bishop of Clonfert, and General Valancey, had learned Irish. This man's library, which filled five large sacks, Mr. O'Reilly purchased from Wright, and on examination found himself possessed of a collection of the rarest MSS., for one of which he has since refused fifty guineas. Master of this valuable repository, he commenced the study of the language, and by persevering application has acquired a deep knowledge of the ancient language of the country.\\" Edward O'Reilly undertook the compilation of the work for which he is best remembered, his Irish-English Dictionary published in 1817. He was appointed assistant secretary to the Iberno-Celtic Society on its foundation the following year with the purpose of preserving and promoting Irish literature. His work during the 1820s included a Dictionary of Irish Writers and catalogues of Irish manuscripts in Dublin libraries including Trinity College. He was one of the earliest collectors of Irish music and his collection is called \\"The Farmer and O'Reilly Collection\\". In May 1830, he was contracted to advise on Irish nomenclature for the early Ordnance Survey maps but spent only four months on this work before his death. Never a formal employee of the Survey, he was probably paid for his professional services. John O'Donovan replaced him in October 1830.  Death  Edward O'Reilly died on Friday 26 August 1830 at Harold's Cross, Dublin. The executor of his estate was his cousin Fr. Eugene O'Reilly, parish priest of Navan, County Meath. His Library of Irish manuscripts was sold in the same year by his executor and many volumes were purchased by the Royal Irish Academy.  Family  Edward's older brother Andrew O'Reilly (1756 - 4 August 1862) was a United Irishman, the Paris correspondent for The Times and the author of the book \\"Reminiscences of an emigrant Milesian\\".

According to his autobiography, Burgess composed the book in just six weeks. He wrote it after his return to England from Malaya in a burst of literary activity that also produced Devil of a State, A Clockwork Orange, The Right to an Answer and several other works. Plot introduction The doctor of the title is Edwin Spindrift, PhD, an unhappily married professor of linguistics who has been sent home from Burma to England suffering from a mysterious brain ailment. While Edwin is confined to a neurological ward, undergoing a battery of diagnostic tests, Mrs Spindrift amuses herself with some disreputable new friends at nearby pubs. Sometimes, to Edwin's distress, she sends these friends to keep her husband company during visiting hours, rather than come herself. Most of the novel is a dream sequence: while he is anaesthetised for brain surgery, Edwin's anxiety over his wife and the company she keeps turns into a fantasy in which Edwin leaves the hospital and encounters his wife's friends, with whom he has various adventures. Background and sources Shortly before he wrote The Doctor Is Sick Burgess suffered an obscure mental breakdown that ended his career as a teacher in Malaya. He came back to Britain convinced that he had a brain tumour. He based some of the events in this novel on his experience of confinement in the Neurological Institute in London. The character Doctor Railton, who is put in charge of Edwin's case, is a fictionalised version of Sir Roger Bannister, who performed neurological tests on Burgess.

Murphy (1887‚Äì1964) (future chairman of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States 19xx-1952), where they were both in the Harvard Glee Club, Harvard Quartet and the Pi Eta Society. Having filled positions in several important churches in Boston, Brookline, and Fairhaven, he went to New York in 1910 as soloist of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church (Manhattan). After further study under Isidore Luckstone, he was engaged (1911) as a member of the Metropolitan Opera.

As was the case with The Incredible Hulk Returns, this television movie also acted as a backdoor television pilot for a series, in this case, for Daredevil (which was not produced). It was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The Trial of the Incredible Hulk was directed by and starring Bill Bixby. Also starring are Lou Ferrigno, Rex Smith and John Rhys-Davies. Despite the film's title, writer/executive producer Gerald Di Pego has stated that the idea of having the Hulk actually go on trial was never even discussed. Plot On the run again after the events of the previous TV movie, a disenchanted and overwhelmed David Banner is working up north under the name David Belson. A bully pushes him around and David is tempted to fight him, but knowing he will just turn into the Hulk again, he walks away. Later, David makes his way towards a large city with the hopes of renting a room and staying incognito. Unbeknownst to him, the city he arrives in is under the control of a powerful underworld crime boss named Wilson Fisk but is also protected by a mysterious black-clad crimefighter known as Daredevil. When two of Fisk's men come onto the commuter subway train after having committed a jewel robbery, one of them takes an interest in a woman also riding the train, but she rejects him. David witnesses the assault and transforms into the Hulk, which results in the usual disruption and chaos. A short while later, David is arrested by the police and wrongfully charged with the crime. While awaiting trial, blind defense attorney Matt Murdock is assigned to David's case. David is uncooperative, but Murdock has faith that he is innocent and is determined to prove so. One night while asleep in jail, David has a nightmare about his upcoming trial and dreams about transforming into the Hulk on the witness stand. The stress of this causes him to transform in reality, and the Hulk goes berserk and breaks free of the prison. Subsequent events see David Banner team up with Daredevil who reveals his identity as Matt Murdock. Matt tells David about his origins which David initially has trouble accepting. Daredevil also reveals that he has an ally on the police force who provides him with information relating to criminal activity. Daredevil goes to investigate a tip provided by his informant, but the tip was planted by Wilson Fisk, and Daredevil is badly injured in an ambush by Fisk's men. David rushes to save Matt but he is too late. but he transforms and the Hulk saves Matt in time from Fisk and his men, who flee the scene. Matt, barely conscious, traces the Hulk's face as he transforms back to David, thus learning David's secret. Meanwhile, Fisk has the witness to events on the subway abducted from protective custody in order to have her killed, but she charms Fisk's assistant, who saves her. Fisk plans a major meeting of underworld crime bosses in order to propose the consolidation of their operations into a syndicate with himself as chairman. Using his training as a medical doctor, David treats Matt's injuries and spreads a cover story about Matt's injuries being the result of falling down stairs. While Matt's self- confidence is seriously shaken, David's confidence has been restored by seeing how Matt has embraced his unique gifts, which are also caused by exposure to radiation. After a little coaxing from David, Matt begins to recover and retrain his body. Soon enough, the two return to work and go to save the captured woman. The two engage Wilson Fisk and his men and ultimately succeed in besting him, without the Hulk appearing. Fisk and his assistant escape, but the prisoner is freed. David and Matt part ways as friends. David continues his search of a cure for himself, and Matt remains in the city to protect it.

He is the jury foreman in the dream sequence. It is not, however, the first cameo appearance by a Marvel creator. Jack Kirby had already made an uncredited cameo appearance in the 1979 Incredible Hulk episode \\"No Escape\\". Reception Though it did not succeed in giving birth to a Daredevil television series, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk garnered very high ratings. Viewers were less enthusiastic about it than The Incredible Hulk Returns. The most common criticisms were the absence of the Hulk himself from the final act and the misleading title (the \\"trial\\" only takes place in a dream sequence). In a retrospective review for the Radio Times Guide to Films, film critic Narinder Flora awarded the film two stars out of five, calling it \\"tame action fare\\" with \\"all the hallmarks of an idea that has run out of steam\\".Flora, Narinder (2014).

As a sideline to recording and producing bands Mattias Olsson writes articles (music-related) for several Swedish magazines. Early life He was born in Hong Kong to Swedish parents. In 1981 he moved to Stockholm. Starting as a drummer at eight years old he started off playing in big bands, pop and classical ensembles. Career When he was 17 he joined progressive rock band √Ñnglag√•rd. √Ñnglag√•rd consisted of musicians from Eker√∂ as well as Waxholm. The band was heavily influenced by bands such as King Crimson, Yes and Genesis but also listened to less famous bands such as Shylock, Cathedral and Yezda Urfa. √Ñnglag√•rd quickly became known for their instrumentation skills and their dynamic range often reminiscent of classical music. When the band started the current trend in progressive rock was to use the newest digital equipment. √Ñnglag√•rd decided instead to use old classic prog equipment like the Rickenbacker bass, Minimoog and the Mellotron. √Ñnglag√•rd recorded two studio albums in the 1990s, Hybris (1992) and Epilog (1994). They also recorded a live album called Buried Alive (1996). The title was a joke from Mattias, the worst title for a live album must be ...Buried Alive. After a long hiatus, the band released their third album Viljans √ñga in 2012. He also did some sessions with White Willow and P√§r Lindh. After √Ñnglag√•rd, he joined Swedish pop band Pineforest Crunch who have so far recorded three albums: Make Believe, Watergarden and Panamarenko. The band's influences ranged from R.E.M, American Music Club to King Crimson and the Sundays. Pineforest Crunch had a very strong D.I.Y ethos and recorded six demos before getting signed to Abbas' old label Polar. The band had a hit from the first album, \\"Cup Noodle Song\\". The single was a hit in Sweden and Japan and led to intensive touring. The second album, Watergarden, was recorded in England with Radiohead producer Jim Warren. Watergarden mixed orchestral textures with Mellotrons and experimental guitars. Parallel with Pineforest Crunch, he started playing drums and occasional keyboards with Reminder. He has since then played in numerous projects and is now active as a record producer. He has recorded albums with Deadwood Forest, Devi, Clockwork, AK-Momo, Nanook of the North, Vijaya and others. =Theatre and film= Together with musician and composer Matti Bye, Mattias Olsson has written music for both film and theatre. In 2009 they wrote music for productions at both Dramaten and Stadsteatern in Stockholm. They have also played together at silent movie festivals and showings both in Troms√∂ and Stockholm. They have written and played music for Berlin, Nanook of the North and Fritz Langs Metropolis. =Studio= Mattias Olsson runs his own studio outside of Stockholm called Roth H√§ndle Studio. The studio started as a simple home studio using an Akai Dps-12 and a handful microphones. There was no plan to become a producer but as bookings started to appear albums started getting recorded. The small home studio is where the Swedish pop band Andreas & Jag started recording three albums. Andreas & Jag was Mattias Olsson and Andreas Morland. Other bands that recorded at the home studio are Pineforest Crunch and Nanook of the North. The first real location was at Finnboda Varv just outside Stockholm. At this studio location bands like Kit le fever and Clockwork recorded early EPs. The Studio has a collection of musical artifacts including claviolines, pipe organs, Stylophones, Mellotrons, Celesta, Orchestrons and Talentmakers. In 2010 the location in Sundbyberg closed and the studio went into storage for a brief while before being relocated to Sollentuna. Personal life Mattias Olsson is married to √Ösa Carild and has three children.

The Register, originally the South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register, and later South Australian Register, was South Australia's first newspaper. It was first published in London in June 1836, moved to Adelaide in 1837, and folded into The Advertiser almost a century later in February 1931. The newspaper was the sole primary source for almost all information about the settlement and early history of South Australia. It documented shipping schedules, legal history and court records at a time when official records were not kept. According to the National Library of Australia, its pages contain \\"one hundred years of births, deaths, marriages, crime, building history, the establishment of towns and businesses, political and social comment\\". All issues are freely available online, via Trove. History The Register was conceived by Robert Thomas, a law stationer, who had purchased for his family of land in the proposed South Australian province after being impressed by the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. The first issue (printed by William Clowes & Sons, Duke-street, Stamford-street, Lambeth, London),The Register's Fiftieth Anniversary South Australian Register 3 June 1887 p.6 accessed 6 June 2011 appeared in London on 18 June 1836 with his friend and partner, George Stevenson, as editor. Thomas embarked for South Australia aboard the later that year, arriving on 10 November 1836 with his family and equipment to set up a printing plant. It was six months before the first colonial edition of The Register was printed on 3 June 1837 in a small mud hut on Town Acre No. 56 Town Acre No. 56 had been purchased by Robert Thomas. in Hindley Street, near what is now named Register Place. (The colloquialism \\"mud hut\\" would seem to be an understatement for a substantial pis√© building in which was operated a demy Stanhope press, an ancient wooden press, and racks holding \\"half a ton of bourgeois and brevier type, a good fount of small pica for printing official documents, and a quantity of general jobbing type\\" with all the other requirements for editing, setting up, printing and distributing an admittedly small circulation newspaper.) From the start, the paper asserted a strongly independent stance. Stevenson's style was vigorous and provocative, making himself and The Register several enemies. His opposition to Colonel William Light's choice of site for the new capital and J.H. Fisher as Resident Commissioner, led them and others to found the Southern Australian in direct competition with The Register. The paper's antagonism of Governor Gawler led to The Register losing government business notably the South Australian Government Gazette. The printers Thomas & Co. had disengaged themselves from editorial content in June 1839 in a vain attempt to protect their monopoly and lost about ¬£1,650 a year. His protest that he was authorised by the British Government to do its printing failed and, insolvent, he sold the paper for ¬£600 to James Allen (previously editor of the South Australian Magazine) in 1842, as Stevenson withdrew from journalism. Thomas also published the weekly Adelaide Chronicle and South Australian Literary Record (10 December 1839 ‚Äì 18 May 1842). John Stephens, who had in 1843 founded The Adelaide Observer, in 1845 purchased The Register.Publication notice South Australian Register 25 June 1845 accessed 26 September 2011 Previous issue of 21 June Publication notice lists James Allen as proprietor. Anthony Forster became part owner in 1848; With the death of Stephens in 1850, his share was taken over by John Taylor. Forster's share was taken over by Joseph Fisher in 1853, then sold to John Howard Clark in 1865.\\"Fisher, Joseph\\" Australian Dictionary of Biography Online accessed 2 June 2011 The paper, having been printed sporadically previously, became weekly in June 1838 and later twice-weekly from February 1843. By 1840, The Register employed a staff of 21 and had reached a circulation of 900. On 1 January 1850, it became a daily publication, and three years later the paper was bought back by Thomas's son William Kyffin Thomas as part of South Australia's first media syndicate with Anthony Forster, Edward William Andrews and Joseph Fisher. They also purchased its weekly sister publication, The Adelaide Observer, and established The Evening Journal (January 1869 ‚Äì September 1912) which morphed into The Journal (October 1912 ‚Äì July 1923) which then became The News. Its Saturday edition was called the The Saturday Journal (July 1923 ‚Äì April 1929). The Register outlasted many competitors throughout its long history, holding a monopoly on the market at various stages, but it ultimately met its match in The Advertiser. The Advertiser, founded in 1858, first emerged as a serious challenger to the paper in the 1870s. The defining move which swung Adelaide readership from the conservative Register to the more egalitarian Advertiser was the latter's dramatic price reduction from 2d. to 1d., and hiring an army of canvassers, on commission, to peddle the paper. The Register was slow to respond, the Advertiser started putting its circulation figures on the masthead. By the time the Register cut its price the die was cast. The Advertiser bought out The Register and closed it down in February 1931 after the Great Depression had severely reduced its fortunes, forcing it to become largely pictorial.

History In the 1949 elections, the Democratic List of Nazareth gained 1.7% of the vote and two seats in the Knesset. It was represented by Seif el-Din el-Zoubi and Amin-Salim Jarjora. The party was sponsored by Mapai, as Ben Gurion was keen to include Israeli Arabs in the functioning of the state in order to prove Jews and Arabs could co-exist peacefully and productively, and during the 1950s several other Israeli Arab parties associated with Mapai appeared. As a result of the association, the party was part of the coalitions that formed the first and second governments during the first Knesset.

Goguryeo won an overwhelming victory over the numerically superior Sui forces at Salsu River. History An old portrait of Eulji Mun-deok, the field marshal of Goguryeo during the second Goguryeo-Sui war In 612, Emperor Yang of Sui invaded Goguryeo with well over one million men. Unable to overcome the stalwart Goguryeo defense at Liaoyang/Yoyang, he dispatched 300,000 troops to Pyongyang, the capital of Goguryeo. Goguryeo General Eulji Mundeok defended against the Sui forces for months, inflicting damage while feigning retreat deep into Goguryeo territory, where an attack at the Salsu River (Cheongcheon River) was prepared and waiting. Eulji Mundeok had cut off the flow of water with a dam in advance, and when the Sui troops reached the river, the water level was shallow. When the unsuspecting Sui troops were halfway across the river, Eulji Mundeok opened the dam, causing the onslaught of water to drown thousands of enemy soldiers. The Goguryeo cavalry then charged the remaining Sui forces, inflicting enormous casualties. The surviving Sui troops were forced to retreat at a breakneck pace to the Liaodong Peninsula to avoid being killed or captured. Many retreating soldiers died of disease or starvation as their army had exhausted their food supplies. This led to an overall campaign loss of all but 2,700 Sui troops out of 300,000 men. The Battle of Salsu is listed among the most lethal \\"classical formation\\" battles in world history. With victory over Sui China at the Salsu River, Goguryeo eventually won the Goguryeo‚ÄìSui War, while the Sui dynasty, crippled by the enormous loss of manpower and resources as a result of its Korean campaigns, started to crumble from within and was finally brought down by internal strife, to be replaced soon thereafter by the Tang.

Unterdiessen, Bavaria. The Via Claudia Augusta is an ancient Roman road, which linked the valley of the Po River with Rhaetia (modern Southern Germany) across the Alps. The route still exists, and since the 1990s increased interest in long-distance hiking and cycling have made the German and Austrian stretches of the Via Claudia Augusta popular among tourists, with the result that modern signage (illustration) identifies the revitalised track. Since 2007, the Giontech Archeological Site, in Mezzocorona/Kronmetz (Italy) serves as the Via Claudia Augusta International Research Center with the support of the Foundation Piana Rotaliana and the Government of the City of Mezzocorona/Kronmetz.Melchiori, Leone (2008), Studi di archeologia romana nella Piana Rotaliana, InMezzo, p.8Fellin, Umberto (2008), 2000 anni di storia, Alto Adige, p.28 History In 15 BC, the Roman general Nero Claudius Drusus, the stepson of Augustus, got orders from his stepfather to improve the passage through the Alps for military purposes and to increase Roman control over Rhaetia and Noricum.Noricum is modern Austria. The project of converting a pack-animal trail to serve wheeled vehicles was completed sixty years later in 46-47 AD by the son of Drusus, the Emperor Claudius. People and goods could pass between the Adriatic and the broad valley of the Po to Tridentum (modern Trento), then northward following the Adige River up to Pons Drusi, the \\"bridge of Drusus\\" which developed into Bolzano. Thence it continued towards Maia (near Merano), and over the Reschen Pass. From the pass it descended through the valleys of the Inn River and the Lech, just beyond Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg), with an extension to Burghoefe ( Sumuntorium ), now Mertingen near the Danube river and not far from the present-day town of Donauw√∂rth; here the Via Claudia Augusta branched into the then important Roman military road running from West to East on the south side of the Danube river (via militaris iuxta riva danuvii or shorter via iuxta danuvii). This then important road is called by modern-day German historians Donaus√ºdstrasse. It served to secure the Roman northern frontier, which was marked until the end of the first century by the Danube river. Two milestones have been found, one at Rabland, a frazione of Partschins, near Merano in the South TyrolIdentified in 1552 and conserved in the Bolzano Civic Museum. and the other in Cesiomaggiore, near Belluno. Both are inscribed with the far terminus of the Via Claudia Augusta, Augusta Vindelicorum (modern Augsburg). The milestones indicate that two routes joined at Tridentium before crossing the Alpine pass: one found its starting point at the vicus of Ostiglia, near the Po, the other, its site less securely identified by archaeologists and historians, at the Adriatic port of Altinum, (near the Venetian Lagoon). On its way to Tridentium, that route crossed the Via Annia, which linked Adria to Aquileia, the Via Popilia, which linked Altinum with Rimini, the Via Aurelia, between Padua and Feltre passing through Asolo, and the Via Postumia, the road linking Genoa and Aquileia. This road was initiated by Drusus as a military artery of conquest and defence, and Emperor Claudius continued its development as a cultural and commercial artery with permanently populated posting stations where fresh horses would be available. Some grew into considerable settlements and were fortified during the later Empire. Others can be identified only by the findings of archaeologists. In the 2nd century AD, a second Alpine pass was opened to wheeled traffic, the Brenner Pass.

He was the last Archdeacon of the undivided St. Thomas Christians of Malabar. After the death of Archdeacon George of the Cross on 25 July 1640, Parambil Thoma Kathanar was elected and enthroned as new Archdeacon, when he was less than 30 years old. He led the Church to the Coonan Cross Oath on 3 January 1653 and to the subsequent schism in Saint Thomas Christians Church. After the Coonen Cross Oath, he was elected as a Bishop by Malankara (Yogam) Association and consecrated as a Bishop at St. Mary's Church Alangad, by laying hands of 12 priests on 22 May 1653. Only two Southist churches of Kaduthuruthy and Udayamperoor and a very few people elsewhere refused to recognise him as Bishop. Any how, the archdeacon began to exercise powers of episcopal order, though he openly tried to regularize his episcopal consecration as a Bishop from the Church of Antioch. His episcopal consecration as a Bishop was regularized in the year 1665 by Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel the Patriarchal delegate of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch.(The exact date and place of this event is anonymous). Palliveettil Mar Chandy, Kadavil Chandy Kathanar, Vengoor Geevargese Kathanar and Anjilimoottil Ittithomman Kathanar were the advisors of the bishop Thoma. Early Church history Thomas the Apostle arrived to Kerala to preach the gospel to the Jewish community. Some of the Jews and locals became followers of Jesus of Nazareth. They were known as Malabar Nasrani people and their church as Malankara Church. They followed a unique Hebrew-Syriac Christian tradition which included several Jewish elements and Indian customs. In Malankara (Present day Kerala) Thomas did not appoint any bishops, but an elder (Mooppen in Malayalam) was selected to lead the people. The parish leader was called Edavaka Mooppen and the church as a whole had a Malankara Mooppen. This was the tradition till 1599, when the Malankara Church of St. Thomas Christians in India, formally became part of the Roman Catholic Church by the Synod of Diamper (Udayamperoor). After the Synod of Diamper three Jesuit archbishops ruled their church until 1652. The archdeacons continued to function under these Archbishops. The Malayalam versions of the canons of the Synod of DiamperFive of the Malayalam versions were available in 1952. use the title Malankara Moopen for the archdeacon throughout the report except in three places where they use the Latin word archidiaconus.Daniel, K. N. Canons of the Synod of Diamper, prepared using five of the available Malayalam versions.Antonio de Gouvea (1606) Jornada do Arcebispo Aleixo de Menezes quando foy as Serra do Malaubar. There is no chance for the Malankara Church to use this Latin word. Portuguese were not familiar with the Malayalam wording Malankara Mooppen and so they might have used archidiaconus. The Malayalam name Jathikku Karthavian, given by some historians was not used in the Malayalam version of the canons. Early life Kuravilangad is a town located in the Kottayam district of Kerala, South India. The town is situated in the Meenachil Taluk, about 22 km north of Kottayam. Pakalomattom family was one of the oldest families at Kuravilangad. Thomas who later became the first Mar Thoma, was born at Parambil house of this family. As Malankara Mooppen Pakalomattom Parambil Geevarghese Kathanar, the Arkkadiyakkon (Archdeacon) died in 1637. His relative Parambil Thomas Kathanar was then appointed by Archbishop Stephen Britto as the next Archdeacon. Thoma Kathanar and his followers swore the Coonen Cross Oath, that \\"they would no longer obey Archbishop Garcia or any prelate from the society of Jesus, nor would ever again admit the Jesuits into Malabar or into their churches\\". After the Coonen Cross Oath, on 5 January 1653, the elders of the church met at St. George church Edapally and proclaimed Archdeacon Thoma as the Governor of the Church. Four very efficient trustworthy and responsible priests, Kalliseril Anjilimoottil Itty Thomman Kathanar, Kaduthuruthy Kadavil Chandy Kathanar, Angamaly Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar and Palliveettil Chandy KathanarMar Chandy Palliveettil were selected as his advisors.Mathew N. M. History of the Marthoma Church, Vol. I. Page 183. All the three, except Kalliseril Anjilimoottil Itty Thomman Kathanar, later defected to the Catholic faction of the St Thomas Christians. Four months after Coonen Cross Oath, on 22 May 1653, twelve kathanars (priests) ordained Thoma Kathanar as the first Bishop of Malankara See by the act of laying hands on him together. The Catholic faction argued that his consecration by 12 priests was irregular, from the fact that his consecration as a Bishop is said to have been regularized by Gregorios Abdal Jaleel ( a delegate of the Patriarch of Antioch), in the year AD 1665, but the place and date yet anonymous. They chose the name Mar Thoma as they considered him the successor of St. Thomas the disciple of Jesus Christ. This action was not accepted by two Southist churches-one at Kaduthuruthy and another at Udayamperoor. Later on Bishop Sebastiani (He was ordained as a Bishop on 15 Dec. 1659) could convince many of the Kathanars, including three trustworthy and responsible priests, Kaduthuruthy Kadavil Chandy Kathanar, Angamaly Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar and Kuravilangad Palliveettil Mar Chandy Kathanar and also many other churches and important laymen that the consecration was irregular. Realizing this and also due to the political and monetary pressure exerted by the Carmelite fathers through the Portuguese and the native kings, many of the churches, Kathanars and laymen now withdrew their allegiance to Mar Thoma. They asked him to give up his dignity of Bishop, which was irregular, but he continued to wear the habit of Bishop and even started giving minor orders and blessing of Holy Oil etc., which acts, only a Bishop is entitled to do. Thus two parties are formed in the Malankara Church-one party under the Bishop Mar Thoma I and the other party under Bishop Palliveettil Mar Chandy called by the Europeans as Alexander de Campo (Chandy Parambil). Both of them claimed to have Apostolic briefs of appointment as Bishop. To resolve the issue and as suggested by the Archdeacons party, the case was referred to the King of Cochin. On 20 September 1661, the King of Cochin asked both parties, to present the Apostolic Briefs in his court. The Apostolic Commissary could produce Apostolic briefs from the Pope of Rome, while the Archdeacon's party failed to produce any briefs. On 9 October 1661, Bishop Sebastiani, tried to capture the Bishop Mar Thoma, with the help of the Portuguese General Captain Ignatius Sarmento, one Kurupp of Purakkad and the Cochin prince Godavarma II, from Mulunthuruthy Church, but he and his party escaped, during the previous night, wearing munds (loin cloths), swords, rollers in hands and special hats on their heads, just like gentile soldiers, so that they could not be recognized by the Nair soldiers.The Grave Tragedy of the Church of St. Thomas Christians and the Apostolic Mission of Sebastiani by Paul Pallath Page 159 Rise of Dutch power The Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC in old-spelling Dutch, literally \\"United East Indian Company\\") was established in 1602. By 1652, VOC trading posts were established in Malabar Coast in India. On 7 January 1663, Cochin was attacked and the king of Cochin surrendered to the Dutch on 20 March 1663. Regularization of consecration By 1665, Cochin was under Dutch control. That year Gregorios Abdal Jaleel, a delegate of the Patriarch of Antioch came to Malankara as per the request of Mar Thoma and regularized his Metropolitan consecration. Last days The last days of Mar Thoma I was comparatively peaceful period for the Puthencoor faction of the Malankara Church. Valiya Mar Thoma, Mar Thoma I, died on 25 April 1670 and was laid to rest in St Mary's Church Angamaly.

Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary DutY Assignments TDY), but only as part of their respective units. =Federal= For much of the final decades of the 20th century, National Guard personnel typically served \\"One weekend a month, two weeks a year\\", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity. The current forces formation plans of the US Army call for the typical National Guard unit (or National Guardsman) to serve one year of active duty for every six years of service. More specifically, current Department of Defense policy is that individual Guardsman will be given 24 months between deployments of no more than 12 months each. =State= When not activated for a Federal mission, the governor through the State Adjutant General commands Guard forces. The governor can call the Guard into action during local or statewide emergencies, such as storms, drought, and civil disturbances, to name a few. History The Arkansas National Guard traces its roots to the creation of the Territorial Militia in 1804. Interest in the Militia in Arkansas generally waxed and waned throughout the 19th century as various national emergencies arose and passed. Organizations existed at the county and city level, but regimental designations above the company level did not become stable until the closing years of the 19th century. During much of this time local militia companies were supported by private funds. Arkansas provided troops for the War with Mexico, the American Civil War, and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War during the 19th century. In each case, in answer to the governor's call, local militia companies would turn out and be formed into regiments or battalions for induction into federal service. The militia was also heavily engaged in the violence that characterized the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Federal Government slowly began to provide increasing funding and direction to the state militias with the organization formally changing its name from the Arkansas State Guard to the Arkansas National Guard following the passage of the National Defense act of 1903. Arkansas National Guard troops participated in the Mexican Expedition in 1916‚Äì1917 and returned home briefly before being mobilized again for World War I. When the Arkansas National Guard units were mustered into Federal Service for World War I, their state designations were removed and they were renumbered in accordance with a national System. These new Regimental numbers are still represented today in the Arkansas Army National Guard by the 153rd Infantry Regiment, formerly the 1st Arkansas Infantry, and the 142nd Field Artillery Regiment, formerly the 2nd Arkansas Infantry. The Arkansas National Guard experience a massive expansion between World War I and World War II, with the first permanent armories being built and troops now directed to drill four times per month and to participate in a two-week encampment in the summers. Arkansas provided many units for World War II. The 142nd Field Artillery, now redesignated as the 936 and 937th Field Artillery Battalions participated in the European Campaigns, while the 206th Coast Artillery and the 153rd Infantry served in the Aleutian Islands. In 1947, as a result of the creation of the United States Air Force as a separate branch from the United States Army, the Arkansas National Guard was split into the Arkansas Army National Guard and the Arkansas Air National Guard. Both organizations work for the Adjutant General of Arkansas. The Adjutant General may be either a member of the Air National Guard or the Army National Guard. The 936th and 937th Field Artillery Battalions, along with several other Arkansas Army and Air National Guard units were mobilized again for service in the Korean War. Throughout the Cold War Arkansas National Guard units underwent multiple re- organizations in response to the nation's Cold War strategy. No Arkansas National Guard Troops participated in the Vietnam War, but the state was called upon again to support Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The years following the first Persian Gulf War saw a dramatic increase in the use of National Guard units for service overseas to support various peace-keeping operations. During the 1980s Arkansas Nation Guard units made multiple training rotations to Honduras during a period of increased Marxist activity. In the 1990s, Arkansas National Guard troops began participating in peace- keeping operations in Bosnia and assisted in the enforcement of a no-fly zone in Iraq by participating in Operation Southern Watch. Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the National Guard transitioned from the nation's strategic reserve to a part of the operational force. In the immediate crisis following the attacks, National Guard troops were deployed to provide security at airports, nuclear plants, and other critical infrastructure in the state and around the nation, as part of Operation Noble Eagle. Arkansas troops participated in operations to support peace-keeping operations in the Sinai and Kosovo to free up regular Army troops for combat, but the state has also contributed multiple troops for the Global War on Terrorism. Every major unit in the Arkansas National Guard has now deployed at least once in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the state's 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team became the first National Guard brigade to deploy to Iraq for a second time when it deployed in 2008. Throughout its service during times of war, the Arkansas National Guard has continued to perform its role of providing service to the citizens of the state during times of disaster. The Guard has responded to numerous tornadoes, floods and fires, in addition to being called upon to provide security and quell violence in times of civil disturbance. The Guard has also provided support to neighboring states, most notably Louisiana during Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike.

The direct selling arm is branded NYR Organics. The company was founded in 1981 in Covent Garden, London. History The first Neal's Yard Remedies shop was opened in 1981 by Romy Fraser in Neal's Yard in Covent Garden as Neal's Yard Apothecary, intended as an alternative pharmacy; the company adopted the present name in 1986 when a franchised off-shoot opened in Oxford to avoid the assumption it was a registered pharmacy. It sells dried herbs, homoeopathic products, essential oils, Bach flower remedies, and a similar range of toiletries. Fraser founded the business as an extension of Neal's Yard Wholefoods, the first such shop in London, which was run by Nicholas Saunders who offered to split the premises and guarantee her bank loan. Other retailers were making requests to stock Fraser's products by 1984. Fraser opened a factory in a former builder's yard in Balham, South London around the same time to cope with demand, moving to a larger factory in 1993. She brought in a managing director in 1999 to concentrate on product development. In 2005, Fraser reduced her stake in the private company from 70% to 15%, selling the difference for at least ¬£10 million to Peter Kindersley, according to the Financial Times. Kindersley, a former publisher, was by this time the owner of Sheepdrove Organic Farm and heavily committed to the associated movement, At this point, the company had a turnover of ¬£12 million. (By 2008, Kindersley owned 90% of the stock, but gave 15% of the company to 280 employees in September.) Also in 2005, the company moved its headquarters from Battersea, South London to a new factory facility at Peacemarsh, near Gillingham, Dorset, which employed 222 people in 2018. In April 2009, the company launched their direct selling arm, NYR Organics which constituted 25% of sales by 2011. It had 5,000 sellers in the UK by 2013 and expanded operations to Ireland. As of 2013, the company had 60 retail stores internationally. By its own account, most of its company's sales in 2018 were to buyers in Asia and the United States. In 2015, the company received an award for innovation in the supply chain category of The Guardian's Sustainable Business Awards. Neal's Yard Remedies is co-owned by Peter, Barnabas, and Anabel Kindersley. Denise Bonner serves as the global head of NYR Organic. From 2000 to 2014, Dragana Vilinac, originally from Sarajevo, was connected with the company, initially as a consultant and then as its head herbalist. By 2015, the company's products were being stocked in 21 countries. Romy Fraser received an OBE \\"for services to the health and beauty industry\\" in the 2008 New Year's Honours. She no longer had any connection with the company by 2014. Neal's Yard Remedies was the first company to be certified by the Soil Association, the organic charity, and the first to be certified as carbon neutral; they use Fairtrade Foundation ingredients.  Disputed health benefits of products  In April 2008, the BBC reported on the company's claims the homoeopathic preparations they offer can help to prevent and treat serious fatal diseases such as malaria. It was reported that this practice was \\"highly dangerous and it puts people's lives at risk.\\" Later in the year, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that the product \\"Malaria Officinalis 30c\\" was \\"clearly intended to be viewed as a treatment or preventive\\" and the company's actions were \\"potentially harmful to public health and misleading\\", and ordered that the product be withdrawn from sale; Neal's Yard acknowledged there was no proof the product worked and withdrew it from sale on 17 April 2008. In May 2009 The Guardians Ethical Living blog invited Neal's Yard Remedies to participate in an installment of the \\"You Ask, They Answer\\" online discussion series, and received assurance from the company of their willingness to participate. A later posting from a Guardian editor stated that Neal's Yard was \\"working on replies\\". Following the posting of questions about the efficacy of their remedies, and comments of a sceptical nature towards Neal's Yard alternative medicines, the company declined to participate in the discussion, and the thread was closed. The refusal of Neal's Yard Remedies to answer any of the questions was criticised by public relations experts. In October 2013, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an import alert regarding the barring of shipments of the company's Cocoa Eye Shadow from entry into the U.S. due to microbiological contamination. In March 2018, Neal's Yard Remedies was notified that their products Covent Garden Superfood Organic Greens Complex and Covent Garden Superfood Organic Cocoa Blend violated the California Health & Safety Code (Proposition 65) because the company had failed to provide required warnings that the products contained lead and cadmium, respectively, and thereby posed a potential health risk to consumers. In July 2018, the company was ordered to pay a settlement of $27,000.

The character became a show heroine, and her 1993 gang rape led by Todd Manning is considered one of soap opera's \\"most remembered and impactful\\" storylines. Character creation =Casting and writing= Marty was conceived as a short-term role. The series had just scripted the death of character Megan Gordon Harrison (Jessica Tuck) from the life-threatening disease lupus. Not wanting viewers to think that lupus is always fatal, they decided to introduce Marty as a character who survives the disease. \\"The character was planned to be part of just one story line\\", said then-executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan. \\"But [Haskell] is such a wonderful actress that we wanted to write more for her.\\" Marty was soon characterized as representing \\"the destructive, privileged, college girl ‚Äì sexually promiscuous and with a serious drinking problem\\". She is at first positioned as causing significant problems for character Reverend Andrew Carpenter (Wortham Krimmer). She develops a crush on him, but he does not respond to her romantic advances. For revenge, she spreads a rumor that he is gay and is having a sexual affair with underage, gay teenage boy Billy Douglas (Ryan Phillippe). Scandal erupts, but Andrew's reputation is eventually restored. When head writer Michael Malone decided to write a gang rape storyline, he started to transition Marty from being primarily bad to being primarily sympathetic. Through further development, the writers \\"explained her cynicism and self-destructive behavior as the result of her being orphaned: Her parents had died when she was quite young, leaving her to be raised by a selfish aunt.\\" The series continued Marty's redemption, and she eventually became the show's main heroine through seeking justice for her gang rape. =Portrayals= Haskell (pictured in 2012) compares herself to Marty.Haskell stated of Marty, \\"She's strong and tough, and she really doesn't trust anyone. She just wants to love and be loved, but that hasn't worked for her yet.\\" Haskell compared Marty to herself. \\"I always think if she'd had the life I had, we'd probably be very similar\\", she said. In 2006, Chambers stepped into the role (Haskell was unavailable at the time due to her real-life pregnancy). When asked if she thought \\"fans had a little trouble separating how the character was written this time around from the fact that this is a new face playing the character\\", she said. \\"Whenever you do a recast, it's always going to be a little bit of a struggle. It's unfortunate that they picked up with Marty 15 years in soap time down the road.\\" Chambers stated, \\"I think the fans were ready to pick up 15 years ago with the character with her traits and that's not what was given to them.\\" Haskell later returned as Marty on June 11, 2008.One Life to Live recap (6/11/08) ‚Äì ABC.com When asked what was it like to start portraying the character again, she stated, \\"It's great. I was a little nervous. It's been a long time... But I've gotta say that everyone's made it so easy there. They've been very accommodating.\\" She said, \\"It's like going home.... And now the role is even more complex. What a gift. It's a great character. She's not your run-of-the-mill character. Her life has been up and down. Now it's even more complicated.\\" Frank Valentini, the show's executive producer, helped to come up with a schedule for Haskell's return, since she was initially busy taking care of her newborn child. \\"[He] knew that from the beginning. When he contacted me I was like, 'This is the deal.' He knew this wasn't a full-time thing for me this time\\", she said. \\"And the way they shoot the shows now, it's easier. It wasn't like when I was there before and you had all day for one show.\\" Haskell stated they had \\"a fantastic nanny who's been with me since the baby was born. And Thorsten's mom is also nearby, so when I'm gone for the day, both of them are here.\\" Haskell said she decided to return to the series for a longer stint because she trusted Valentini and knew Ron Carlivati was back in charge as head writer. \\"And I knew that he was aware of the character. That was one of the concerns about the previous head writer [Dena Higley]\\", stated Haskell. \\"She really didn't seem to. But you know, I feel safe there and it's not my first time around, so if I've got questions or ideas, we'll all just figure them out together.\\" Haskell felt that an amnesia-stricken Marty was a good idea, and was interested in working with Trevor St. John (current Todd) and Michael Easton as John McBain. Haskell asked Valentini to send her information about what her character had done since she last portrayed the role. \\"...[H]e said, 'Oh, you don't have to worry about that. She doesn't remember.' Okay! Great! You don't even know how much help that was for me\\", stated Haskell. She said she did \\"put a lot of thought into\\" how her character would be now, but that \\"it comes back to you, it really does. The most prep I did was learning my stinking lines. That was where I was the most out of practice. Gotta get that muscle going again.\\" Storyline =1992‚Äì97= Marty Saybrooke is the scion of one of Llanview's oldest and most prestigious families. Orphaned at an early age, \\"poor little rich girl\\" Marty grows up alone in her family's mansion and is the sole heiress to her parents' fortune. Marty comes to be a troubled young woman who resorts to binge-drinking to garner attention. Marty is introduced as the roommate of the ailing Megan Gordon Harrison during her stay at Llanview Hospital. Both Megan and Marty are diagnosed with lupus, but Marty has chosen to ignore the consequences of her hard-partying lifestyle, which has exacerbated the symptoms of her dangerous disease. Despite her rough exterior, it is clear that deep down, Marty has a wounded heart. After Megan passes away, Marty becomes close to one of her neighbors, Megan's mother Victoria \\"Viki\\" Lord Buchanan. She also becomes infatuated with Reverend Andrew Carpenter. When Andrew rebuffs Marty's advances, the spurned young woman launches a smear campaign across Llanview, using her knowledge of classmate Billy Douglas' homosexuality against him, claiming that Andrew is gay and has been having \\"illicit relations\\" with young Billy. The rumor is squelched, and Marty's credibility is severely tarnished. Marty's life is forever changed when she meets cocky Llanview University defensive back Todd Manning and has a one-night stand with him. \\"Ladies' man\\" Todd learns he has met his match when the flighty Marty rejects him the next day. Todd still pursues her, but Marty does not give in to his boorish and chauvinistic advances. A bitter resentment and rivalry develops between the two, particularly after Marty agrees to be Todd's tutor. Todd fails a crucial course due to lack of studying, and irrationally blames Marty for his failure, while still stung by her romantic rejection of him. His anger having reached a boiling point, Todd begins to plot the ultimate revenge on Marty. On May 13, 1993, when Marty becomes drunk at the \\"Spring Fling\\" party on campus, she is gang raped by ringleader Todd and two of his fraternity brothers, Zach Rosen and Powell Lord III. Marty eventually reports the rape, and Todd is arrested along with Zach, Powell, and Powell's distant cousin Kevin Buchanan (whom Marty mistakenly believes has also raped her). Placed on trial, the four men are represented by attorney Nora Hanen Gannon, ex-wife of District Attorney Hank Gannon and mother of Kevin's girlfriend Rachel Gannon. Nora believes Todd and the others are innocent and is clearly winning the trial, especially after Marty remembers that Kevin had nothing to do with the attack and exonerates him, which damages Marty's case even further. Kevin, however, grateful for Marty's confession, decides to help Marty. He and Jason Webb (Dorian Lord's boyfriend at the time) find another young woman named Carol Swift, who reveals that Todd raped her as well. Disgusted, Nora intentionally causes a mistrial. A furious Todd declares revenge on Marty. He corners her in an alley and threatens to rape her again, but Luna Moody comes to Marty's rescue and scars Todd's face in the process. Powell witnesses the incident and tells the police. In addition, Marty manages to trick Todd into confessing to the rape, which she tape records. Todd is sent to jail, determined to get revenge on Marty, Nora, and Powell (whom Todd will learn years later is his biological cousin). Later Todd briefly escapes from jail, again threatens to rape Marty at gunpoint, resulting in Marty's boyfriend, Suede Pruitt's, attempting to come to her rescue and being killed during his struggle with Todd. Marty's life remains turbulent even after Todd is convicted of his crimes; after finishing medical school, she revisits the past in a brief, foolhardy flirtation with Andrew Carpenter, who is tempted away from his new wife Cassie. Then, Marty grows close to Luna's brother Dylan Moody. After the fugitive Todd saves Marty, Jessica Buchanan, C.J., and Sarah Roberts from a car crash, he is pardoned and set free, enraging his former victim. Nonetheless, over time, Todd and Marty forge a strange kind of understanding and attempt to gain some closure. Todd encourages Marty to confront her aunt, Kiki, who is her guardian. Kiki, a society friend of Dorian's, has been raiding Marty's immense trust fund to finance her jet-set lifestyle. Marty travels to Ireland, where her aunt is staying, and succeeds in severing ties with her. While in Ireland, Marty meets and falls in love with poet and former Irish terrorist Patrick Thornhart, who is trying to escape some former criminal \\"associates\\". However, back in Llanview, a young AIDS patient whom Marty has cared for is dying. Todd travels to Ireland and lends Marty his private jet to fly back while he helps her newfound love, only to be mistaken for Patrick and allegedly killed by the assassins. Todd's pregnant wife, Blair Cramer, harbors great resentment toward Marty for her part in Todd's \\"death\\". Upon her return to the States, Marty works with Patrick to help Bo Buchanan and the Llanview Police Department foil the plans of the Irish terrorist cell the \\"Men of 21\\". After an ill-advised marriage to the paralyzed Dylan, Marty admits her true love for Patrick and they finally reunite. Unfortunately, while still single, Patrick has already spent the night with a lonely Blair and conceived a child. Tragically, Blair loses the baby in a car accident, but Todd, now back from the dead, blames Patrick for Blair's loss, and contacts another of Patrick's old foes, IRA terrorist Mahoney. On the day of Patrick and Marty's wedding, Mahoney shoots Patrick, who appears to die in Marty's arms at Todd's penthouse. Marty sobs as she clutches her husband's body and tells Todd that Todd is not a man, but a curse. While in the ambulance with Patrick, however, Marty is shocked to discover Patrick is, in fact, still alive. Together, Marty and Patrick flee the country to live happily ever after, telling only friends Nora, Bo, and Mel Hayes of their fate, fearing reprisal from Patrick's enemies. In her cryptic letter, the newly-pregnant Marty tells Bo and Nora that they are expecting a daughter. =2004‚Äì07= Years later, Marty briefly reappears in early 2004 to testify on Todd's behalf when he is on trial for supposedly raping Blair; she explains that she is now openly living in California as a practicing psychiatrist working with sex offenders, and tells the court that she believes Todd is a \\"changed man\\". Despite never forgiving Todd for her rape, Marty believes that Todd is so traumatized, that he will never commit the crime of rape again. She urges Blair, who is unaware that she is suffering from a brain tumor, to reconsider her recollection of the night Todd \\"raped\\" her. Marty makes no mention of Patrick or their child, or how they have eluded the terrorists hunting the Thornharts. The following year, Marty appears again, as a hallucination of Todd's, taunting him after his rape and torture at the hands of Margaret Cochran. This spectre comments on the irony of \\"Margaret [raping] Todd\\", due to Marty's birth name also being Margaret. Marty returns to Llanview on November 17, 2006 (now played by Christina Chambers). Marty is shocked to learn that her son, high school quarterback Cole (her child by Patrick), is being accused of attacking Todd and Blair's daughter, Starr. Marty reveals that she has just recently moved back to Llanview and has set up her practice, and that she and Cole are still reeling from Patrick's mysterious death. Todd, Blair, and Marty are all determined to keep their children apart. Marty serves as psychiatric consult in the court case against the nefarious Dr. Spencer Truman, declaring him mentally unfit and thus sparing him a prison sentence, outraging Todd, Blair, and Llanview Chief of Detectives John McBain, whose father was killed by Spencer in Atlantic City. Later, when Spencer is killed while attempting to abduct and rape a hospitalized Blair, McBain is determined to find the culprit. Marty, meanwhile, begins having disturbing visions of being in Blair's hospital room on the night of the murder, and seeing a scalpel. Marty confesses her fears of having killed Spencer to her therapist, but can not fully remember what her mind has blocked out from that fateful night. When the lovestruck Miles Laurence is determined to win Marty's heart, he takes extreme measures, stealing Marty's audiotaped \\"confession\\" from her therapist's office and blackmailing her with it, forcing Marty to marry him in order to retain custody of her son. Marty finally tells John McBain about her precarious situation, and John becomes determined to exonerate Marty, find Spencer's true murderer, and end Miles' sick game with Marty's life. Before John can learn the truth, however, the evidence against Marty becomes overwhelming, and she is arrested as the prime suspect in Truman's murder. John and Marty struggle to uncover the hazy details surrounding the night Spencer was killed, and eventually Marty remembers that she was never able to strike Spencer; instead, he assaulted her and left her in a vacant hospital room, leaving her with a head injury. Soon thereafter, John deduces that Lindsay Rappaport is the real murderer, and Marty is released from prison. After being exonerated, Marty is determined to move forward with her life and end her marriage to Miles. A guilt-ridden Miles, having seen the error of his ways, helps the process along by confessing in open court to having blackmailed Marty into their marriage. Weeks later, Marty's marriage is annulled. Cole and Jessica Buchanan urge Marty to consider a romantic future with John McBain, but a bashful and unsure Marty refuses to consider it. Regardless, Marty seeks John out, and the two spend an afternoon walking the Llanview docks. At the close of the evening, Marty impulsively kisses John. Marty instantly apologizes, but an intrigued John tells her not to be sorry. They share a romantic kiss again soon after. John and Marty continue to bond during the custody trial for Tommy McBain, but after Marcie McBain goes on the run with her adoptive son, John leaves Llanview to pursue his sister-in-law, along with Todd Manning. After John starts a barfight in Decatur, Georgia, he and Todd are arrested. Marty and Blair go down to Decatur and bail them out. Marty and Blair insist on joining John and Todd as they search for Marcie in the hopes of preventing the two enemies from killing each other. After the group hits the road, John's car breaks down, and the quartet is forced to get a room at a local motel. Initially there is only one room available but Todd uses his \\"charm\\" and money to obtain a room from one of the other guests. Marty and John spend the night together in the first room. During the evening, John opens up to Marty about the murder of his former fiancee, Caitlin Fitzgerald, and explains that Lee Ramsey, the FBI agent pursuing Marcie, holds a grudge against him because of Caitlin's death. Marty in turn confides in John about Patrick's murder. She reveals that Patrick was killed by old enemies from Ireland, and that his old friend Simon Ryerson came to her door to give her the news. Having bonded by unburdening themselves, John and Marty end up making love. After Cole is abducted back in Llanview by a mysterious man in a \\"Death\\" costume, another unseen figure shows up at John and Marty's motel room and grabs her just as she gets a call from Starr on Cole's cell phone. Marty and Cole are taken to Ireland and held hostage by none other than Patrick's \\"old friend\\" Simon, who was actually the terrorist who killed Patrick. Simon is determined to get an incriminating \\"list of names\\" which Patrick kept from his days with the \\"Men of 21\\", but is frustrated to discover that Marty has no knowledge of the list; in reality, Patrick hid the list on a microchip inside one of his own poetry books. John finds the chip, and he and Lee Ramsey pursue Marty and Cole overseas and make contact with Simon in Ireland. They set a time and meeting for an exchange: Marty and Cole for Patrick's microchip. Things seem to be going as planned, until Ramsey fires upon the van which contains Marty and Cole in an attempt to apprehend the terrorists. The van spins out of control and goes careening over a cliff. Racing to the bottom of the rock quarry, John struggles to free Marty from the wrecked van, but she insists that he find Cole first, saying she has no life without her son. John reluctantly leaves her side and is able to rescue Cole, who was thrown from the van in the crash, but watches helplessly as the van explodes. Marty is presumed dead, and the bereaved John and Cole return to Llanview. In the aftermath of Marty's death, her loved (and not-so-loved) ones deal with her loss in their own way: John discovers her posthumous Christmas gift, a dartboard with Todd's face on it; Cole undertakes grief counseling with friend Langston Wilde; and Todd quietly orders a lavish flower arrangement for her memorial service, without leaving his name. =2008‚Äì11= In the spring of 2008, John becomes suspicious about Ramsey's shady activities since becoming Police Commissioner of Llanview. Banding together with fellow police officers Antonio Vega and Talia Sahid, John works to expose Ramsey as a dirty cop and avenge Marty's death. During the course of their investigation, the trio learn about a mysterious woman Ramsey is keeping hidden away in his high-rise penthouse, tended to by a private nurse. John becomes convinced that this woman is key to unraveling the mystery behind Ramsey's double dealings. As it happens, John's suspicions are correct: Ramsey masterminds the theft of the crown jewels of Mendorra from Lindsay Rappaport's art gallery in order to fence them and pay for his houseguest's costly medical care. It becomes clear that the mystery woman is not merely bedridden, but also mentally impaired due to her unknown ailments. Meanwhile, John's curiosity deepens when he discovers X-rays in Ramsey's office which detail the severe physical trauma of an unidentified female patient. John has a surveillance device planted inside Ramsey's penthouse. John, Antonio, and Talia stake out the building, waiting for Ramsey or his guest to come into audio range of their \\"bug\\". On June 11, 2008, the officers listen in as Ramsey speaks to the woman, who says only two words on tape before the surveillance device goes out of range: \\"help me\\". As John struggles to identify the familiar voice, it is revealed that the mystery woman being cared for by Lee Ramsey is none other than Marty. Ramsey is working with con artist Tina Lord, the Crown Princess of Mendorra, who he plans to sell the Mendorran crown jewels to in order to provide for the crippled Marty's medical treatment. During an exchange between Ramsey and Tina for the jewels, two thugs hired by Jonas Chamberlain enter the penthouse. While Tina hides in another room, Ramsey is murdered by the two thugs, who are then shot and killed by John when he arrives on the scene. Seizing the opportunity, Tina flees the penthouse, distracting John from going upstairs and finding Marty. Later, Todd arrives, having followed Tina, and discovers Marty, who has been left with amnesia after the explosion in Ireland and has no idea who Todd is. Todd brings Marty to his new home, where he keeps her as his 'guest,' hiding the traumatized woman from her family and friends while telling her that she has no family or friends. Marty has a photograph of herself with John, whom she feels a connection to, and when Marty asks about who the man in the picture is, Todd feeds Marty several lies, telling her that John is the man who left her to die. Todd begins to feed Marty a slanted, selective version of their shared history, claiming that they were friends in college, and colorfully embroidering the truth to claim that John stole his wife and family from him. When Marty pressures Todd for more information about the past, Todd tells Marty that she was gang raped in college, while not letting on that he was involved. Marty comes to rely on Todd as a caretaker during her slow rehabilitation, and finds herself growing close to the man he represents himself to be. Todd begins telling Marty that she is his only confidant during his estrangement from Blair and his daughter Starr. When Blair becomes suspicious of Todd \\"mystery woman\\" in his house, he claims that the unidentified woman is his new girlfriend and that their connection is \\"deeper than sex.\\" Todd nonetheless allows himself to enjoy his and Marty's \\"friendship\\" while he deceives her. On August 18, 2008, Marty has a nightmare, in which she begins remembering her rape.One Life to Live recap (August 18, 2008) ‚Äì ABC.com Later that night, she dreams of John, who warns her that Todd is lying to her. When Todd learns that his niece, Jessica, who has had a mental breakdown in the wake of her husband's death, is operating under an alternate personality \\"Tess\\", he's cornered into a stalemate where \\"Tess\\" threatens to reveal that he's hiding Marty if he reveals that Jessica has had a psychiatric meltdown. \\"Tess\\" then backed-up Todd's lies to the unsuspecting Marty. Over time, Marty and Todd's relationship intensifies, and Marty begins to express romantic feelings for her \\"caretaker\\" On the outs with his family and increasingly delusional, Todd kisses Marty passionately then pulls away. Todd begins to fantasize about a \\"clean slate\\", free of all the \\"mistakes of the past\\". In a manic outburst, Todd offers Marty a shocking proposition: Run away with him, and raise his daughter's unborn child. Todd claims that his daughter, Starr, wants him to have her baby, when in reality Starr wants nothing to do with her father. Starr intends to give the baby up for adoption to Marcie McBain. Marty is shaken by Todd's request to run away and start a family with him, but, still unknowing of the truth, she agrees; however, when Marty continues to dream about John McBain and regains her ability to walk, Todd fears that his lies will be exposed. As Marty grows physically stronger, the unstable Todd grows eager to whisk Marty away to their \\"new life\\" before she can remember the truth. Meanwhile, John continues to investigate the \\"mystery woman\\" Blair told him about and begins to suspect that Marty may be alive and imprisoned by Todd. Growing increasingly obsessed with the idea of \\"erasing their past\\", Todd describes himself as 'falling in love' with Marty and proposes marriage to her. Marty refuses, saying she needs to understand who she was before she can move forward into the future. But, when Marty accesses the internet on Todd's laptop and begins to research her past, Todd convinces her to abandon her search for her previous life, 'let go of the past', and move on with him. Marty's memories are stirred when she babysits Jessica's daughter Bree and flashes back to caring for an infant (her son, Cole). Marty pleads with Todd to help her understand what the strange images of a child mean, but Todd lies, insisting that Marty never had children and that she is thinking only of \\"the son she never had\\", further encouraging her to join him in raising his daughter's soon-to-be-stolen child. When Starr goes into labor on October 31, 2008, Todd and Marty finalize their plans to leave Llanview forever, with Todd buying them a large home in New Mexico and making plans for Marty and he to marry. Todd also sends Marty's private nurse, con artist Lee Halpern, to assist in his plan to steal Starr's baby; Marty remains unaware of any wrongdoing. When Todd buys Marty a new wardrobe, she models his purchases and the situation culminates in Marty telling Todd that she's falling in love with him and wants make love. As things heat up, he flashes back to the night of the rape. Unaware of the true impact or significance of her words, or how Todd has manipulated her, Marty tells him that he is 'not the man he once was,' and that she is 'healed and new, not the woman she used to be.' She insists that all that matters in the present is their \\"love.\\" And on November 6, 2008, Todd and the amnesiac and housebound Marty have \\"consensual\\" sexual intercourse. After the act, Todd has second thoughts about stealing his daughter's newborn. Before rushing to the hospital, he tells Marty he will be back soon, leaving her to write in her new diary about her \\"passionate night\\" with Todd and their newfound \\"love.\\" As Marty lies in her bed, John McBain comes crashing through her bedroom window on a rope. When John comes in, Todd appears in the doorway. Confronted with his lies, Todd has to confess everything that he did to Marty. Marty bitterly informs Todd that he has essentially raped her all over again. John beats Todd up and Todd is charged with kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and rape. Todd and Marty are taken to the hospital. While there, Cole sees Marty who she still doesn't recognize. He's the first to tell her that she had children and that he is her son. When alone with Nora, Marty angrily tells Nora that she \\"willingly\\" had sex with Todd but she is horrified by what has been done to her. Marty starts to feel nauseous at the thought of having had sex with the man who was the ringleader in her gang rape. Nora advises her to take the morning-after pill to prevent pregnancy due to her sexual encounter with Todd. She does, and later tells Todd with satisfaction. In December 2008, T√©a Delgado (Todd's former wife) returns to defend Todd in the subsequent rape trial, and this time Nora, Todd's lawyer from the college gang rape, is the prosecution. The rape charges, as well as the other charges, are dropped when in a scathing cross-examination T√©a corners Marty into saying that, regardless of her mental state and diagnosable brain damage done to her in the car accident that caused her amnesia, Marty had invited Todd's \\"lovemaking\\". Devastated when the rape and kidnapping charges are then dropped, an unraveling Marty sets a plan in motion; professing to still \\"love\\" Todd ‚Äî who still delusively believes that even cognizant of their history that Marty could still \\"love\\" him ‚Äî Marty lures Todd to a private New Year's celebration for two. On the roof of the Palace Hotel on January 2, 2009, she urges him to do the one thing that will make her happy: jump. Todd steps off the edge, and plummets into the water below. His ex-wife Blair drags him out of the river.One Life to Live recap (1/2/09) ‚Äì ABC.com One Life to Live recap (1/2/09) ‚Äì Soaps.com Later, Marty's other rapists, Powell Lord and Zach Rosen returned to town. During a series of events, Marty is recaptured by Powell who claims that he's 'helping her' and who blames Todd for having destroyed all of their lives. After Marty and Todd are rescued from Powell Lord, by John McBain, Marty finally remembers her past. Marty and John finally get together, and she soon discovers that she is pregnant with John's child. However, John is having dreams about finding Natalie in his bed and Natalie's feelings for John resurface just as Marty and John learn they are having a baby. Tragedy strikes, however, when Marty suffers a miscarriage after being pushed down a flight of stairs by a mystery assailant, who is later revealed to be Eli Clarke. Shortly after, John leaves Marty for Natalie. Several months later, Cole is led to believe that Eli Clarke has murdered Starr and their daughter Hope, which results in Cole shooting Eli, killing him. Marty tries to take the blame, but Natalie soon squanders that plan and Cole is sent to prison. It is discovered that Starr and Hope had escaped Eli, but then had been kidnapped by Hannah O'Connor, a troubled young woman whom Marty had taken in to keep the girl from being sent into foster care. Hannah had become obsessed with Cole and had kidnapped Starr in order to kill her so that she (Hannah) could have Cole all to herself, but James Ford managed to thwart her plans. Both shocked and furious that she had never noticed that Hannah wasn't getting any better, Marty disowns her, coldly informing Hannah that she is unfixable and that it was a mistake to ever trust her before she is dragged away by the police. Marty vows revenge against a now-pregnant Natalie, who claims the baby is John's. Meanwhile, Todd tricks Starr into signing a restraining order forbidding Marty any visitation to Hope, Marty's grandchild, leaving Marty even more devastated. Marty becomes suspicious of Natalie's friendship with Jessica's fiance and John's friend, Brody Lovett and wonders if perhaps Natalie's unborn child is really Brody's ‚Äî not John's. Upon obtaining a copy of Natalie's amnioplasty results, which claim that Brody is the father of Natalie's child, Marty uses it as an opportunity to exact her revenge. She confronts Natalie and attempts to blackmail her into springing Cole from jail, threatening to tell John about the DNA test if she does not. However, after discovering that John has proposed to Natalie, Marty seemingly promises not to do so, but in fact plans to tell Jessica at the ceremony and have her inform John. To this end, she crashes the ceremony, but her plan derails when Jessica is rushed to the hospital due to pregnancy complications. In the ensuing argument between herself and Natalie, Marty falls and strikes her head. Natalie subsequently takes Marty to the Buchanan lodge, holding her at gunpoint and planning to leave her stranded at the lodge with no way to get help, and also to ensure that Marty loses her job as a psychologist after informing the cops that Marty stole her medical records. However, when Natalie's water breaks before she can leave, Marty turns the tables on her, turning a deaf ear to Natalie's pleas and departing, leaving the laboring Natalie alone with no way to send for help. However, Marty has a pang of conscience and returns to help Natalie give birth. John tracks her and Marty to the lodge and walks in moments after Natalie has given birth to a baby boy. When Marty holds Natalie's baby, she suffers a complete nervous breakdown, believing it to be her and John's baby. At the hospital, it becomes clear to all that Marty is completely insane, as she is convinced that it was Natalie and not Eli who pushed her down the stairs. After bursting in on John and Natalie, sobbing that the baby is hers and that Natalie is trying to steal it, Marty is committed and sedated. The truth about Natalie's baby eventually comes out, and a betrayed John calls off their engagement. As he begins dating Kelly Cramer, a seemingly recovered Marty is released from St. Anne's; soon after, she confesses to her psychiatrist, Dr. Buhari, that she switched Natalie's paternity test results ‚Äî and that John is indeed the father of little Liam. However, instead of going to Natalie and John with the truth, Marty keeps it to herself in the hopes that she will be able to reconcile with John. Showing that she is still deranged, Marty threatens both Natalie and Kelly, prompting John to feign interest in a reconciliation with Marty just so he can keep an eye on her. In May 2011, Marty becomes even more unhinged and sees not only Natalie but Kelly as a threat to her reunion with John. When Marty arrives at John's to prepare him dinner, she has a confrontation with Kelly, who pick up a knife in defense. Off screen Marty stabs Kelly twice, who is later discovered bleeding in the bathroom by John. Later, Natalie, having acquired Marty's session tape, confronts Marty on the roof of the Angels Square Hotel. After a brief struggle Marty ends up hanging on for dear life, saved by Natalie. Marty thanks Natalie for saving her life, but then pushes Natalie off of the roof. Natalie miraculously survives the fall and is discovered by John and Brody. When Brody goes to the roof searching for Marty, Marty knocks him out and leaves, taking Liam with her. Todd shares the news with Marty that her husband Patrick is still alive. He then takes her to the airport where he tells her that she's going to see her husband, but before Marty leaves she tells Todd that she forgot to tell John that Liam is his son. Marty gets Todd to promise that he will indeed tell John the truth, and afterwards Marty leaves town with Patrick on the plane. =Post Cancellation History= In 2012 During an appearance on General Hospital Marty's son and granddaughter die in a car crash. During a 2019 appearance by Nora Buchanan on the same soap opera it is revealed that Marty suggested to Kevin Collins that he hire Nora for his legal defense. Reception and impact Marty's impact on daytime television has been substantial. The 1993 gang rape storyline inspired feminist studies, and Haskell won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress for the role in 1994. In 2009, she won for Outstanding Lead Actress. Though the rape storyline was well-received, it was also criticized. Opinions were given that it polarized \\"the gap between rapists and the raped\\". There was concern that the show departed from the rape paradigm by not only insisting the essential \\"goodness\\" of Powell Lord, who had also raped Marty, but that it implied peer pressure \\"could be an adequate (or even physiologically possible) excuse for rape\\". Analyst Mary Buhl Dutta reasoned the storyline invokes \\"rape myths\\" cataloged by scholar Martha R. Burt, such as \\"only bad girls get raped\\", \\"women ask for it\\", and \\"women 'cry rape' only when they've been jilted or have something to cover up\\". Burt said such myths \\"deny or reduce perceived injury, or ... blame the victims for their own victimization\\". At the time of Haskell's return to the role in 2008, Marty was called \\"one of those tentpole characters [characters who hold enormous sway with viewers] that everyone who has watched One Life to Live at some point remembers\\".

These 'cast' reproductions were, in an era before commercial photography, an integral educational tool in teaching people the history of art and antiquities. Together with his brother, Emilio, the Caproni brothers supplied art schools, major universities and museums in the United States and abroad with quality reproductions. The firm operated under their ownership between 1892 and 1927, the year the company was sold and a year before Pietro's death. Before World War II major United States museums had cast collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. Although Caproni did not supply these museums with their casts, he did supply other museums with their casts, and they included: *the William J. Battle Collection at the University of Texas, *the George Walter Vincent Smith Museum, Springfield, Massachusetts, *the Portland Art Museum, Portland, Oregon. University collections which the Caproni firm installed included those at Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University, Cornell University, and Emory University. Art schools such as the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts used Caproni casts as models for their art students to draw from. Additional installations of Caproni Casts were in leading hotels, theaters, and concert halls. The Loews theatre chains of the early 19th century featured Caproni casts, as did Symphony Hall, Boston and the atmospheric theaters designed by John Eberson. Rising sculptors of the time sought the expertise of the Caproni studios when creating some of the country's best known civic sculpture. Among them was Cyrus Edwin Dallin, whose Appeal to the Great Spirit and Paul Revere, both of which are standing in Boston, were modelled in the Caproni studios' basement. Other known artists who worked with the Caproni Brothers include Daniel Chester French, Loredo Taft, and Leonard CraskeGloucester Fisherman which was made famous on TV commercials for 'Gordon's of Gloucester' fishsticks in the 1970s and 1980s. Caproni worked with these sculptors to model the original plasters before these major pieces went to a bronze foundry. When Pietro Caproni arrived in Boston in the 1870s he was apprenticed to Paul A Garey, whose plaster statuary company dated back to 1834. Pietro and Emilio bought the company in 1892 and quickly starting building a new studio and workspace at 8 Newcomb Street in Roxbury. In 1896 they purchased two brownstone buildings on 1920 Washington Street, and connected all three buildings with a gallery space to showcase their work. By 1900 the two brownstone buildings facing Washington Street were re-faced to appear as one building and an enclosed bridge connected them to the Newcomb Street building behind. The company issued catalogues most every year between 1892 and 1915. Hard-cover catalogues were published in 1901 and 1911, the latter being the largest and most complete catalogue ever published by the company and was used by schools as a guide to identifying antiquities. After 1915 soft-cover catalogues were published in 1922 and 1928. The company changed ownership, and names, frequently between 1928 and 1950's, most of its owners falling into receivership due to lack of sales and interest in what were widely perceived as 'only copies'. Lino Giust bought the Washington Street buildings in 1970 and operated them as the Giust Gallery until his retirement in 1995. Today the buildings are condominium homes. Caproni casts can be identified by a metal hallmark imbedded into the base of the cast. Early casts have brass hallmarks bearing \\"PP CAPRONI & BROTHER PLASTIC ARTS, BOSTON, MA.\\" In later years the medium changed to aluminum. In 1932 the company changed names to 'Caproni Galleries, Inc' and was a supplier to Disney for the plaster figurines of all the Disney characters. Amadeo Nardini, owner of a casting company which specialized in ecclesiastical subjects, bought the company around 1940 and ran it as \\"Caproni Galleries of Amadeo.\\" Pietro was born in Barga, Italy and left Italy for Boston in the late 1870s. His first marriage to Jane M. Stayner produced four children and the marriage ended in divorce. His second wife and later widow, Gertrude Brinkhaus, was an advocate of art in Public Schools and later saw through her husband's wish to bequest a Maternity Wing to the Barga Hospital, at the time the largest private gift to the Italian people, as acknowledged by Benito Mussolini. Pietro and Gertrude are buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. The Sleeping and Awakening Lion statues are based on Antonio Canova's design for the Tomb of Pope Clement XIII in Rome. In 1993, Robert Shure purchased the entire Caproni Collection and the business rights to the Giust Gallery. Until 2003, the Washington Street address was still rented from Mr. Giust although most of the pieces were cast at a new location offsite since 1993. In 2006, a small gallery was set up at 105 Salem Street in Woburn Massachusetts where the pieces are all made by hand continuing to use traditional methods of plaster casting and are shipped all over the world. The new owner, Robert Shure, a plaster cast and bronze expert, restoration expert, and sculptor in his own right, has recovered many more original vintage Caproni casts and greatly enlarged the collection. The company is now flourishing and has supplemented the cast collections of many locations including the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and The Jerusalem Studio School in Israel. They have also recently added the full sized Victory of Samothrace back into the collection and a copy now occupies the Darwin D. Martin House (designed by Frank Lloyd Wright) in Buffalo, New York as a replacement for the original one placed there by Mr. Wright. Art schools and ateliers across the USA and beyond now use their anatomical casts for their drawing/sculpting classes. Discerning designers and collectors of historical casts are also among those who collect these museum quality castings. The collection can be seen online at www.giustgallery.com.

Giovanni was a student of painting and assistant under Francesco Albani, being, evidently, adept at the depiction of water scenes. He produced faithful copies of his master‚Äôs paintings. His surviving independent works include an Ascension (1651; Bologna, Certosa) and in the church of Buon Ges√π, Bologna, a frescoed St Bernardino and two sibyls. Giovanni Maria Galli-Bibiena died on 21 June 1665 in Bologna, but he had laid the foundations of an artistry which was continued by his descendants, who dedicated themselves to architectural work and set design for the theatre. Using the highly ornate style of late baroque sculpture and architecture, the members of the Galli-Bibiena family produced a series of theatrical and other designs that are exceptional for their intricate splendour and spacious proportions achieved by detailed perspective. From about 1690 to 1787, eight Bibienas designed and painted for many of the courts of Europe with intricate settings for operas, weddings, and funerals. The Habsburgs were their most generous patrons. The works of the Galli-Bibiena family in theatrical scenery were not executed in durable material. Also, because their decorative works for court functions were necessarily temporary, few of their creations have survived; however, the richness and splendour of their works can be judged from drawings made at the time, which have been preserved in great numbers and are found mainly in collections at Vienna, Munich, Dresden and Montreal.  Sons and daughter  Maria Oriana Galli- Bibiena (1656-1749), Italian portrait painter, born at Bologna, was daughter of Giovanni Maria Galli. Maria studied with Carlo Cignani and Marcantonio Franceschini, and she specialized in portraits and history pictures. She married the younger landscape painter Gioacchino Pizzoli (1661‚Äì1773), and later, their son Domenico Pizzoli (1687‚Äì1720) also became a painter. Maria, at age 93, had outlived her famous brothers and died in Bologna in 1749. Ferdinando Galli Bibiena (18 August 1656 - 3 January 1743), born at Bologna, was the first son of Giovanni Maria Galli. He studied painting from Carlo Cignani and architecture from Giulio Troili. He worked for the duke of Parma 30 years, on the villa and garden of Colorno, but also worked for the theatre. In 1708, at Barcelona, he arranged decorations for wedding festivities of the prince, future Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor; Ferdinando went to Vienna and worked on designs of scenery and decorations for court festivities and the opera. Returning to Bologna in 1717, he was elected a member of the Clementine Academy. Beginning in 1731, he built the Mantua royal theatre (which burned in 1781). He wrote several books, including: L'Architettura civile (1711; \\"Civil Architecture\\" and various titles) and Varie opere di prospettiva (1703‚Äì1708; \\"Various Works of Perspective\\"). :: Francesco Galli Bibiena (12 December 1659 - 20 January 1739), \\"Galli-Bibiena, Francesco\\" (biography), Encyclopedia of Austria, 2006, aeiou-Austria webpage: aeiou-FrancescoGBibiena: has dates, work for Leopold I, designed Gro√üe Kom√∂diensaal. Italian architect and designer, was born at Bologna as the second son of Giovanni Maria Galli. He studied under both Lorenzo Pasinelli and Carlo Cignani. After working at Piacenza, Parma, and Rome, he then became the ducal architect at Mantua. After living in Genoa and Naples, Francesco Galli Bibiena was called by Emperor Leopold I to the Vienna Hofburg, where in 1700, he built a large theatre, the Gro√üe Kom√∂diensaa' (\\"Grand Hall of Comedies\\"), which became the Court Theater (Burgtheater). After a short stay in Italy and in Lorraine, he was invited by Emperor Joseph I, back to the Hofburg, to work as the \\"First Theatrical Engineer\\" and as a scene-painter/decorator from 1709-1712. Francesco was architect of the great theatre in Nancy, France; of the Teatro Filarmonico at Verona (Verona Philharmonic Theatre, which some have called the finest theatre in Italy); and of the Teatro Alibert in Rome. In 1726, Francesco returned to Bologna, where he directed the Clementine Academy.  Grandsons  Alessandro Galli Bibiena (15 October 1686 Parma - 5 May 1748 Mannheim), Italian architect and painter, was the eldest son of Ferdinando and was born at Parma. In 1719, Alessandro became architect and painter at the court for the elector of the Electorate of the Palatinate (in Germany). Among the major works of Alessandro, were the right wing of the castle and the opera house (which both burned in 1795) and also the Jesuit church at Mannheim. Some German documents use the name \\"Alessandro Galli di Bibiena\\". \\"Museum Haus Cajeth - Galerie & Buchhandlung\\" (Heidelberg), Hans-Martin Mumm, Heidelberg, Germany, October 2004, webpage: Cajeth-House-gallery.

From 1723 to 1747, he worked as \\"His Majesty's First Theatrical Engineer\\" for Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, where he decorated all of the Habsburg celebratory festivities. Together with his younger brother Antonio, he designed theater decorations and for festivities in Vienna, also Linz, Graz, and Prague (1723 \\"Costanza e Fortezza\\" at Hradƒçany castle). In 1753, he moved to Berlin in the court of Frederick the Great of Prussia, where he died three years later. Antonio Galli Bibiena (1 January 1700 Parma - 28 January 1774 Milan), Italian architect, born in Parma, third son of Ferdinando, had been a pupil of Giuseppe dal Sole and later of Marcantonio Franceschini. Antonio became the architect of the Virgilian Academy at Mantua (Italy), and architect of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. He was also employed at the Hofburg court of Vienna. Antonio died in Mantua in 1774, at age 74. Giovanni Carlo Galli-Bibiena ( 11 August 1717 Bologna - 20 November 1760 Ajuda, Lisbon), architect/designer, the son of Francesco, designed the staircase of Palazzo Savini and a chapel, the Cappella di San Antonio in San Bartolommeo di Porta Ravegnana in Bologna, and the decorative scheme for the high altar of the San Petronio Basilica, Bologna, for the Bolognese Pope Benedict XIV. From 1752-55, he designed and built the √ìpera do Tejo in Lisbon, but the opera house was destroyed seven months after completion by the 1755 earthquake. He died five years later.  Greatgrandsons  Carlo Galli Bibiena (1728‚Äì1787), son of Giuseppe Galli Bibiena, was born in Vienna. This last member of the theatrical Bibienas traveled farther from home than the rest of the family. Carlo Galli Bibiena worked in 8 countries, including: Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands (1746‚Äì1760), London (1763), Naples (1772, where Carlo published five opera sets); Stockholm (1774); and St. Petersburg, Russia (until 1778).

During the reign of his elder brother Swargadeo Siva Singha, he held the post of Charing Raja or the heir apparent to the throne. Most of the chronicles recorded that Swargadeo Rudra Singha expressed his desire at his death-bed that all his five sons Siva Singha, Pramatta Singha, Mohan Maladev Gohain alias Barjana Gohain, Rajeswar Singha and Lakshmi Singha successively became king, after him.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

The Kalugayan Borpatrogohain, the Dihingia Borgohain and the Dihingia Naobaicha Phukan took up the cause of Tipam Raja, and assembled the attendants and servitors employed in the interior of the royal household in one place, and made up their minds to install the Tipam Raja as king. After Swargadeo Siva Singha had died, the Tipam Raja left his feet and took his bath. He then armed his adherents with swords, shields, spears, arrows and bows, and asking them to remain ready for action he himself waited in full preparedness.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

Chengmung Burhagohain and Rupchandra Borbarua said to Tipam Raja: The Burhagohain asked the Charing Raja to seize the hands of Tipam Raja, which he did accordingly. The Charing Raja had a sword in his hand. The Tipam Raja asked him to throw off the sword, and he snatched away his hand from the Charing Raja's grip. The Burhagohain advised the Charing Raja not to part with the sword. The Tipam Raja requested his followers to give him a dao(a sharp weapon), but the Burhagohain intercepted and threatened by saying that the man who would give him a dao would have even his son in the womb hacked and quartered. Saying so Chengmung Burhagohain then took out Charing Raja and his three brothers as well as the Tipam Raja, but they were confronted at the michang or ante-chamber by the bevy of household attendants. Chengmung Burhagohain then said to Rupchandra Borbarua: Just at that time Laidhan, who was a Changmai-ligira or an attendant of the royal cooked, gave the Burhagohain a sword which he pointed at the miscreants and they dispersed. The Burhagohain‚Äôs party then came out to the gate-house, and there also they were confronted by the rebels who were also dispersed after some altercation. The party then reached the courtyard of the palanquin-bearers.

The Ahom monarchs always maintained very friendly relationships with their tributary kingdoms. One of such tributary kingdoms was Rani, a place in southern part of Kamrup District, mostly inhabited by Karbis and Garos. Its rulers had a long association with the Ahoms since the days of Ahom-Mughal conflicts.Gait E.A.

He utilized his peaceful reign in the construction of temples and buildings. He constructed the famous Rang Ghar, an amphitheater made of bricks and had two roofs, for the purpose of animal fights and other amusements during the festivals like Bihu. Even though his father Swargadeo Rudra Singha constructed an amphitheater during his reign, it was made of wood and bamboo. The Rang Ghar is reputed as the oldest existing amphitheater in Asia. Pramatta Singha also caused the gatehouses of Garhgaon to be built in bricks.

The temple is known as Rudreswar Temple and hence the village was named Rudreswar.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

An interesting story circulates around the death of Swargadeo Pramatta Singha. The king used to complain about severe headache from time to time. It was said that he had a vision in his dream that if he offers prayers in the holy shrine of Islam, his headache would get cure. Therefore, one Muslim cleric was selected and arrangements were made for his journey to Mecca. The cleric was instructed to offer prayers for the king's well being and good health. As instructed, the cleric went to Mecca and prayed for the king's good health and long life. He returned to the capital Rangpur after a gap of two and a half years, but before he reached the capital, the king died due to illness.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati page 248 Family and issues Swargadeo Pramatta Singha was survived by two sons, named Molou Gohain and Madhab Gohain.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha first edition 1975 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati page 231 Legacy Entrance of Hayagriva Madhab mandir In Hajo, there is local lore that Swargadeo Pramatta Singha, while on his visit to the Hayagriva Madhava Temple, witnessed a pair of Bulbul birds fighting in the temple premises. Therefore, he ordered to hold Bulbul bird fights every year in Magh Bihu, a tradition which the people of Hajo continued till recent years (banned by the supreme court recently). According to historical chronicles, there are no records of Swargadeo Pramatta Singha visiting the temple of Hayagriva Madhava; rather it was his younger brother Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha who had paid a visit to the temple during a royal tour in 1756 CE.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

Swargadeo Pramatta Singha was known as a kind and lenient ruler. His seven years long reign, though uneventful, was peaceful and prosperous.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta page 185 The buildings and temples built by him still bear witness of his prosperous reign.

The bacterium is sensitive to the majority of antibiotics, such as the penicillins, ampicillin, cephalosporins, quinolones, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim.

History  Los Hermanos Rosario is an emblematic Merengue music band from the Dominican Republic. The orchestra was founded on 1 May 1978, Labor Day in Salvale√≥n de Higuey, a town on the edge of the eastern part of the Dominican Republic. At that time, the 7 brothers debuted with the municipal authorities in a ceremony in their native town. Shortly thereafter, Los Hermanos Rosario began a quest in search of artistic success. They developed their activities initially in their native town and in some cities in the east of the country. An important start for the brothers was being hired by a teacher, Chiquit√≠n Payan, to enliven activities at Casa de Campo, a Resort in La Romana, a town in their country. In 1980 the band recorded their first single \\"Maria Guayando\\" which quickly caught the attention of the public. So they decided to move to the capital city Santo Domingo and released their first album thus resulting in great success. This first album contained these hit songs: \\"Las Locas\\", \\"Vengo Acabando\\", \\"Bonifacio\\" y \\"El L√°piz\\". In 1983 the group suffered a tremendous loss when the leader, pianist and musical director, Pepe Rosario, died. This situation forced Los Hermanos Rosario to suspend their activities for a while and even caused the members to think of ending their musical career. However, the orchestra was able to bounce back from their loss. After the loss of a brother, a mentor, and an outstanding musician, the brothers rose out of the ashes and placed themselves at the top of the artistic scene. In 1987, they launched a new album titled \\"Acabando\\" which contained songs that have surpassed the time barrier. These title songs include: \\"Borr√≥n y Cuenta Nueva\\", \\"Adolescente\\" and \\"La Luna Coqueta\\". A successful career started, and Los Hermanos Rosario continued reaching new heights of popularity. Hits such as \\"Otra Vez\\", \\"Fuera de Serie\\" and \\"Insuperables\\" made the band one of the most listened to musicians in the Dominican Republic. Songs such as \\"Rubia de Fuego\\", \\"Ingrata\\", \\"Mi Tonto Amor\\", \\"Bomba\\", \\"Cumand√©\\", \\"Loquito Por Ti\\", \\"Dime\\", \\"Esa Morena\\", \\"Br√≠ndame Una Copa\\", \\"Desde Que la V√≠\\", \\"Mil Horas\\" and \\"Pecadora\\" kept the band under the spotlight. The song \\"Pecadora\\" was included in the soundtrack of the 1991 film Tacones Lejanos, a Spanish production directed by Pedro Almod√≥var. The group launched another album in 1993 titled \\"Los Mundialmente Sabrosos\\". The first single of this album, \\"Amor, Amor\\", reached number one on the Tropical music charts in the United States, Puerto Rico, The Dominican Republic, Central America, Venezuela and Colombia. \\"Amor, Amor\\" situated Rosario Brothers in Billboard Magazine and with the second single, titled \\"Morena Ven\\", they manage to become the first act within the Merengue genre, situating in the top 10 of Billboard Magazine (a position reached so high only by Juan Lu√≠s Guerra). That song became an anthem in the Spanish world, consolidating them as the most valued and popular Dominican ensemble abroad. \\"The Wretched\\", \\"Oh, woman\\", \\"Slave of your love\\" and \\"Good luck\\" make the list of records which were also hit songs of that work. In 1995 Los Hermanos Rosario launched the album that would be the most internationally successful of their career to this date, \\"Los Due√±os del Swing\\" (in English: \\"The Owners of Swing\\"). This disc, with excellent speed and quality, with the single \\"La Due√±a del Swing\\" (in English: \\"The Mistress of Swing\\"), placed on top of all the Latinos Hit Parades. This album was honored by Billboard magazine as Tropical Music Album of the year: it became one of the most popular merengue record in the history of this style, with essential reference for all Latin music clubs in the world. Together with \\"The Owner of Swing\\", the theme \\"A day in New York\\" became quite a musical event, and the same happened with \\"kleptomaniac\\", \\"Video Clip\\", \\"Candy\\", \\"Hot Women\\", \\"oleyl\\", \\"Oh, how lonely\\" and \\"Woman banned\\". After that topping album, the band released their first Billboard charts number-one hit Latin music album \\"Y Es Facil\\" (1997), followed by \\"Bomba 2000\\" (2000) and \\"Swing A Domicilio\\" (2002), which continued an unstoppable way of recording with topics which have been true musical events: \\"The Rompecintura\\", \\"The Weekend\\", \\"Feel\\", \\"It freed me\\", \\"To your recollection\\" and \\"I like\\". During his career, the group has taken their music all over the Americas and Europe: the Carnegie Hall, Madison Square Garden, Lincoln Center, Radio City Music Hall, the Polyhedron of Venezuela, Latin American Festival of Milan, Rome Festival, London, Madrid, Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, Berlin, etc. are just some places and capitals of the world where have performed Los Hermanos Rosario. They have been awarded many times with the popular \\"Congo de Oro\\" (Golden Congo) at the Carnival of Barranquilla, in Colombia, and their award of \\"Super Congo de Oro\\" (Super Golden Congo), in Puerto Rico, generated a veritable craze with their music, becoming a source of inspiration for many merengue interpreters of neighboring islands, who found in Rosario Brothers an input to develop their careers along the lines of the famous Merengue Bomba genre. The Canary Islands surrendered to their feet, and with Andy Monta√±ez this act has recorded and performed for most people in occasions like Carnivals, with certifications by Guinness Book of Records. After an inadvertent removal of the recording studio in 2003 for a legal dispute with his former record label Karen Records, which remained without a new record for 5 years, Los Hermanos Rosario came back on track with their new album in 2007 titled \\"Aura\\", which was released under the label \\"J&N; Records\\" and \\"Sony BMG Music Entertainment\\". This album contains 13 tracks, which already began to play in major radio stations across America a song entitled \\"Al√≤\\", a lilting Bachata Merengue merged with authoring and arrangements by Sandy MC, Jorge and Rafael Rosario, and is destined to become another success of Rosario Brothers. This recording session was entirely made in the Dominican Republic, and for this the Rosary Agency gave the services of the best technicians, composers, musicians and arrangers of their country. With the album \\"Aura\\" the band confirmed their qualities and commitments to the merengue genre, blending the typical style with other musical elements and innovative colors in wearing.

Told in reverse chronological order and narrated from shifting perspectives, the story spans more than thirty years in the lives of four sisters, beginning with their adult lives in the United States and ending with their childhood in the Dominican Republic, a country from which their family was forced to flee due to the father‚Äôs opposition to Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo's dictatorship. The novel's major themes include acculturation and coming of age. It deals with the myriad hardships of immigration, painting a vivid picture of the struggle to assimilate, the sense of displacement, and the confusion of identity suffered by the Garc√≠a family, as they are uprooted from familiarity and forced to begin a new life in New York City. The text consists of fifteen interconnected short stories, each of which focuses on one of the four daughters, and in a few instances, the Garc√≠a family as a whole. Although it is told from alternating perspectives there is particular focus throughout the text on the character of Yolanda, who is said to be both the protagonist and the author's alter ego. Background and historical context The years between 1956 and 1970 were a period of oppression and instability in the Dominican Republic as the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo came to an end with his assassination in 1961, only to be followed by military rule, revolution, intervention by the United States, and further dictatorship. Central control over the military, the economy, and the people meant that only a select few were allowed to leave the island. Critic William Luis describes the situation of immigrants from the Dominican Republic to the United States during the revolution: \\"The displacement of Caribbean people from their islands to the United States, for political or economical reasons, has produced a tension between the culture of the country of origin and that of the adopted homeland, one representing the past and the other future of the immigrant\\". The Garc√≠a family is an example of this phenomenon. In How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in altering the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in the Dominican Republic, and is forced to face the challenges which come along with being an immigrant family in a foreign land. Julia Alvarez herself was not born in the Dominican Republic, but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. Clearly in the novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, it is evident that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems that normal North American girls do. Even though How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents was written in the United States, there are significant historical ties between the novel and the author‚Äôs country of origin. Alvarez wrote an essay entitled \\"An American Childhood in the Dominican Republic\\", in which she reveals some information about her own life. This is evidence that it may have served as the basis for the novel. For example, she mentions that it was Mr. Victor, of the US embassy and a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who persuaded Carlos Garc√≠a to join the resistance against Trujillo, and later helped him in leaving the country, and obtaining a job with an international cardiovascular team. This is a parallel to the novel in which Carlos Garcia obtains work as a doctor in New York. Julia Alvarez emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with her parents and three sisters as political refugees from the Dominican Republic. The novel is a variation of her real-life experiences, which have perhaps been slightly altered. The majority of her literature is constructed from multiple viewpoints and a strongly concealed political undercurrent is present in her literature. In this case, that undercurrent is her family fleeing the Trujillo revolution, something she did as a child. The novel encompasses the impact living under a regime can have on a family, and the way it shaped the four girls' upbringing. It is also an attempt to understand memory, the past, and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents. Plot summary The novel is written episodically and in reverse- chronological order. It consists of fifteen chapters in three parts: Part I (1989‚Äì1972), Part II (1970‚Äì1960), and Part III (1960‚Äì1956). Part I is centered on the adult lives of the Garc√≠a sisters; Part II describes their immigration to the United States and their adolescence, and Part III recollects their early childhood on the island, in the Dominican Republic. The Garc√≠as are one of the Dominican Republic's prominent and wealthy families, tracing their roots back to the Conquistadores. Carlos Garc√≠a, a physician and the head of the family, is the youngest of 35 children his father sired during his lifetime, both in and out of wedlock. Laura, Carlos's wife, also comes from an important family: her father is a factory owner and a diplomat with the United Nations. Many members of the extended family live as neighbours in large houses on an expansive compound with numerous servants. In the early 1950s the Garc√≠a girls are born. Carla, Sandra, Yolanda and Sof√≠a enjoy a happy, protected childhood and are brought up by their parents, aunts and uncles to preserve the family traditions. Their countless cousins serve them as playmates. =Part I= The first part of the novel establishes Yolanda at the centre of the story as she narrates the opening and closing chapter: \\"Antojos\\" and \\"The Rudy Elmenhurst Story\\", respectively. In third person, Yolanda's return to Dominican Republic as an adult is described in the context of a family birthday party and a road trip. Their unity as sisters as \\"The Four Girls\\" is introduced in the third chapter, which is communally narrated. They celebrate Carlos, the patriarch's, birthday, and Sof√≠a introduces her baby son to his grandfather, helping to repair the father and daughter's relationship somewhat. During Sof√≠a's chapter, \\"The Kiss\\", it is revealed that Carlos discovered a packet of love letters addressed to his daughter, enraging him and leading to a conflict which ends in Sof√≠a running away to her German lover. A major focus in this section is the romantic relationships between the four sisters and their partners. Sof√≠a is married to a \\"world-class chemist\\"; Carla and Sandra are in long-term relationships; and Yolanda is in love with her psychiatrist and has previously broken up with a man named John. Part I closes with \\"The Rudy Elmenhurst Story\\", narrated by Yolanda. This describes Yolanda's first real relationship, and the tension between her upbringing and American relationships: \\"I would never find someone who would understand my particular mix of Catholicism and agnosticism, Hispanic and American styles.\\" =Part II= Part II details the family's collective experience of living in the United States as immigrants. The girls first attend a Catholic school in New York and later boarding school, and assimilate fairly well to their new environments, although meeting with a few set-backs along the way. Their time in the US begins with the opening chapter, \\"A Regular Revolution\\", and delivers the girls' (collective) opinion that \\"We didn't feel we had the best the United States had to offer. We had only second-hand stuff, rental houses in one redneck Catholic neighborhood after another\\". While during their first few months in New York they regularly pray to God that they will soon be able to return to their homeland, they quickly start appreciating the advantages of living in a \\"free country\\" so that even being sent back to the Dominican Republic for the summer becomes a form of punishment for them. A major turning point in the novel comes with Laura's discovery of a bag of Sof√≠a's marijuana, and her subsequent punishment of being removed from her boarding school and forced to spend a year in the Dominican Republic with family. This event is representative of the girls' transformation into Americans and away from the Dominican culture and Laura and Carlos' conflicted relationship with the assimilation. Laura \\"still did lip service to the old ways\\", and Carlos makes a point of educating the accents out of the girls, thus showing the tension between the cultures. Carla becomes the victim of racism in the third chapter, \\"Trespass\\", with school boys telling her to \\"Go back to where you came from, you dirty spic!\\" Later she is subjected to a child molester who masturbates in his car while pulling up at the curb and talking lecherously to her through the open window. The second part of the novel finishes with the chapter \\"Floor Show\\", in which the Garc√≠a family goes to a Spanish restaurant and Sandra witnesses the host's wife amorously attempting to kiss her father on the way to the bathroom. Overall, Part II presents the unexpected aspects of living in the United States and becoming Americans, and explores the tensions that develop with the immigrant experience. =Part III= The Dominican Republic, in relation to the rest of the Caribbean The five chapters in Part III, the concluding section, focus on the Garc√≠a family's early years in the Dominican Republic, and are the most political of the novel. The first chapter, \\"The Blood of the Conquistadores\\", opens with an account of two of Trujillo's agents coming to the family home looking for Carlos. His revolutionary politics and work against the Chapitas made the family a target, and this chapter explicitly details the danger of their situation. The issues in past chapters appear superficial in comparison to the life-or-death nature of the conflicts that the Garc√≠as face earlier in their lives. The family escapes persecution, but is forced to emigrate immediately, establishing their motive for relocating to New York. The second chapter, \\"The Human Body\\", describes what happens to Mundin, Yolanda and Sofia in the dirty shed near the house. Yolanda plays with her boy cousin, Mundin, and in exchange for a Human Body doll and a modeling clay, shows him her genitals. Sofia also follows suit. ' \\"Go on,\\" Mundin ordered impatiently. Fifi had caught on and lowered her pants and panties to her ankles. I gave my sister a defiant look as I lifted up my cowboy skirt, tucked it under my chin, and yanked my panties down (Alvarez, 235).' As Part III progresses, the narrative switches to describing their upper-class life on the island, and filling details of the lifestyle the family was born into. The story of the voodoo practicing Haitian family maid is elucidated: she escaped Trujillo's massacre of Haitians and came to work for Laura, although much of her family was not so lucky. In the last three chapters Carla, Yolanda and Sandra narrate stories from their childhood surrounded by the extended family, and the girls' relationship with the United States begins. \\"An American Surprise\\" tells of their early ideas of New York City, \\"where it was winter and the snow fell from heaven to earth like the Bible's little pieces of manna bread.\\" The reader realizes that the innocence of childhood and idealized vision of their soon-to-be adopted country, given the reverse-chronological narration of How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents, are left behind with the Garc√≠a's home in the Dominican Republic. Characters =Sofia= Sofia, \\"Fifi\\", is the youngest of the four girls, and is the maverick out of her sisters. She gains the attention of the reader multiple times throughout the book, as her stories are different in nature from those of the other Garc√≠a girls. In the book Alvarez quotes \\"Sofia was the one without the degrees. She had always gone her own way\\". Out of her sisters, she was the plain one but had consistent boyfriends and was always being asked advice about men from the other three girls. In the first chapter, \\"The Kiss\\", readers are told the story of her rebellious marriage to a \\"jolly and good natured\\" German man in Colombia during a rebellious vacation with her current boyfriend. After her marriage to him, her relationship with her father deteriorates significantly until her son is born. The family reunites to celebrate her father's birthday and son‚Äôs christening, although Sofia still feels the same antagonism she felt towards him beforehand. =Sandra= Sandra is the second daughter in the novel, the pretty one who could \\"pass as an American, with soft blue eyes and fair skin\\". We see the loving and caring part of her personality emerge in \\"Floor Show\\" where at a very young age she decides that if her family got into a really bad financial situation, she would attempt to get adopted by a rich family, get an allowance \\"like other American girls got\\" which she would then pass onto her family. The spot-light falls on her again when she goes away to a graduate program and her parents receive a letter from the dean saying Sandra has been hospitalized after an extreme diet, revealing that she is anorexic. She dreams of being an artist. She broke her arm. =Yolanda= Yolanda is the third oldest and most imaginative of the four girls. She plays the most important role in the novel as Alvarez's alter ego. She is a schoolteacher, a poet and a writer. Her nicknames, which reflect and represent the different aspects of her personality, consist of \\"Joe\\", \\"Yosita\\", \\"Yoyo\\" and simply \\"Yo\\", which is also the title of the sequel to How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents. Each of these nicknames are the product of one of Yolanda's multiple personalities. There is important significance in her character as \\"Yo\\", Spanish first person pronoun, the \\"I\\" of the narrator. The nickname \\"Yoyo\\" is reminiscent of the toy that goes up and down, back and forth, similar to Yolanda‚Äôs bouncing from culture to culture, from one extreme to another. The last, \\"Joe\\" represents the American version of Yolanda. Her ultimate return to the Island \\"represents her desire to displace herself from the North American Joe to the Yolanda of her family and youth.\\" These nicknames \\"act to properly define and name the many diverse facets of her complex personality\\". Her character is that whose voice and words are most frequently heard throughout the novel; she is the most developed character and her identity is the most explored of the four girls. She is best friends with her cousin Mundin. =Carla= Carla is the eldest of the four daughters. As is common for the oldest sibling, she is somewhat seen as the mediator between the four sisters in the novel. \\"As the therapist in the family Carla likes to be the one who understands everything\\" and \\"has a tendency to lace all her compliments with calls to self- improvement\\". However to her sisters, this creates a somewhat dominating character at times reminiscent of their mother. Her criticism goes farther when she writes an autobiographical paper calling her mother mildly anal- retentive. In Carla‚Äôs first and perhaps most prominent story in the novel, \\"Trespass\\", as she is walking home from school in New York, a man exposes himself to her and attempts to lure her into his car. Alvarez uses Carla's character to display the language difficulties faced with only having \\"classroom English\\", and how communication barriers affect immigrants. Style and structure Alvarez defies the Aristotelian notion of a well-knit plot, as the story is told in reverse chronological order through a series of fifteen chapters, with no linear, unifying storyline. In Julia Alvarez: A critical companion, Scholar Silvio Sirias argues that \\"a well-constructed plot has an underlying structure that promises the reader that the author is in control, and that any event she is telling will eventually make sense\\". Sirias then goes on to explain how Alvarez's initial exposure of the girls to the reader in their somewhat adjusted, adult states enables her to first evoke certain assumptions in the reader and subsequently shatter these assumptions with the disclosure of the Garc√≠a family's troubled past. Scholar Julie Barak argues that the reverse chronological order Alvarez employs is actually a unique stylistic technique which adds \\"to the reader's uncertainty and instability, [allowing for the recreation] of the Garcia girls' own ambiguities\\". Scholar William Luis observes a strong resemblance between the structure of Julia Alvarez‚Äôs How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents and Alejo Carpentier's Viaje a la Semilla as both employ the tactic of backwards narration and consequently lay claim to two beginnings and two endings. Alvarez has also been said to follow the stylistic traditions established by novels such as Pedro Juan Labarthe's The Son of Two Nations: The Private Life of a Columbia Student (1931), Marcio Veloz Maggiolo's El pr√≥fugo (1962), Humberto Cintr√≥n's Frankie Cristo (1972), and Richard Ruiz's The Hungry American (1978). Despite the overtly North American stylistic qualities the book appears to boast at first glance, each of the aforementioned authors are of Hispanic descent. Julie Barak emphasizes the significance of \\"one other stylistic idiosyncrasy of the work that adds to the sophistication of [Alvarez's] artistry\\" as there is a marked transition from third to first person narration for each girl in the last section of the novel. Luis describes this shift as a pivotal moment after which the events assume a chronological order and time accelerates, illuminating life in such a manner that it suddenly makes sense. The manner in which Alvarez alters the narrative voice is a stylistic expression of the extent to which each one of the girls \\"wants to be in control of her own version of her history... These first person narratives in the last section become, in effect, a defense offered by each girl in her own words, an explanation of who they have become in the present, of why they 'turned out' the way they have.\\" The transition of narrative voice \\"changes the dynamic of the reader-character-author triad\\" and allows for the reader, who has been kept at a distance by the third person narrator, to relive \\"the memory with the character, closely connected to her, developing a strong empathy with a unified character\\". Jacqueline Stefanko rationalizes Alvarez‚Äôs decision to alternate amongst the varying voices of all four Garc√≠a girls, wither her assertion that \\"the amnesia produced by the diasporic cultures of Latinas gets negotiated within the text through polyphony\\". After significant observation, Stefanko has concluded that \\"as hybrid selves who cross and recross borders of language and culture, these Latina writers create hybrid texts in order to 'survive in diaspora,' to use Donna Haraway's term, seeking to heal the fractures and ruptures resulting from exile and dispersal\\". Through her creation of How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents Alvarez has intentionally fictionalized her own life story in a polyphonous manner which extends beyond the boundaries of traditional style and genre, thus setting herself apart from the average author both stylistically and structurally. Major themes =Fragmentation of self= Perhaps one of the most prominent themes in How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents is that of the fragmented concept of the self. The fragmentation of one's personal identity is a serious issue suffered by all four Garc√≠a girls throughout the course of the novel. Their immigration has left them as multiple beings, torn between their Dominican and American identities. As a college student, Yolanda encounters a boy named Rudy Elmenhurst, who is relentless in his attempts to pressure her into bed with him. When he can bear frustration no longer, Rudy lashes out and ends their relationship, leaving Yolanda devastated and hoping for his return. The inner turmoil evoked in Yolanda by this traumatic episode is evident through her realization of \\"what a cold lonely life awaited [her] in this country. [Yolanda] would never find someone who would understand [her] peculiar mix of Catholicism and agnosticism, Hispanic and American styles\\". Julie Barak, of Mesa State College, has described this passage as a poignant and elegant reprisal of the recurrent sense of being divided selves and speaking divided languages found throughout the majority of the text. The Flamenco dance in the \\"Floor Show\\" chapter evokes similar feelings of desolation in Sandra, as Mrs. Fanning's drunken interruption of the distinctly Hispanic dance performance makes \\"a parody of it, a second-rate combination of cultures that Sandi cannot find fulfilling. She is searching for a unified self, something noble, true, beautiful. Just as she gets close to it, however, it is ruined, dissolving into a gauche pastiche too similar to her own divided life in the States\\". Latin American literature scholar, Jacqueline Stefanko, along with several of her peers, has made pointed mention of the significant implications Yolanda‚Äôs multiple nicknames hold for her fragile and fragmented sense of self. Stefanko observes that \\"as Yolanda's names proliferate on the page, we begin to see the multiplicity of her identity [and] realize the struggle Yolanda must engage in to not be fragmented in a society that marginalizes her\\". Scholar William Luis reinforces the notion that Yolanda‚Äôs shattered identity stems largely from the \\"multiple names used [to refer to her]. She is Yolanda, Yoyo, Yosita, Yo and, last but not least the English Joe. And above all, she is 'Yo,' the Spanish first person pronoun, the 'I' of the narrator.\\" Julie Barak finds the wording of Yolanda‚Äôs note to her husband, John, explaining why she must leave him, quite significant with reference to her divided self-concept. Yolanda began \\"I'm going home to my folks till my head-slash-heart clears. She revised the note. I'm needing some space, some time, until my head-slash-heart-slash-soul- No, no, no she didn't want to divide herself any-more, three persons in one Yo.\\" =Quest for clarification of identity= The search for a clear and distinct personal identity is thematically quite closely related to that of the fragmented self. The quest undertaken by the Garc√≠a sisters for the clarification of their confused identities, however, is an attempt to achieve a solution to the problem posed by the fragmented self, and thus warrants separate categorization. Scholar William Luis reminds readers of Alvarez that \\"Yolanda's search for her Dominican identity must be understood within the context of the 1960s in the United States\\". As they begin to grow, the girls resent their parents who appear oblivious to their need to \\"fit in America among Americans; they needed help figuring out who they were, why the Irish kids whose grandparents had been micks were calling them spics\\". Luis uses the term \\"onomastic displacement\\" with reference to the multiple nicknames that fragment Yolanda's concept of a whole and unified self. This continuous onomastic displacement incites in Yolanda the desire to question her divided identity, to seek unity, clarity and a coherent understanding of her circumstances. Yolanda achieves this clarity through the act of writing and even as a young girl she revels in the completion of her speech for the Teacher's Day address because \\"she finally sound[s] like herself in English!\\" Unlike her sister Sandi, \\"whose artistic predilections were crushed as a child, Yolanda faces and works through her identity problems in her writing\\". Barak views Yolanda's writing as a process that can be used to reunite the fragments of her identity; as an aid in the acceptance of \\"her own 'hybrid' nature... bringing both her worlds and all her selves into balance\\". It is thus only through writing, the expression of Yolanda's most intricately personal thoughts and revelations, that the protagonist can retain the hope of restoring her unified personal identity. =Assimilation= Assimilation is a particularly difficult process for Hispanic Americans because they have \\"old countries that are neither old nor remote. Even those born in North America travel to their parents' homeland, and constantly face a flow of friends and relatives from 'home' who keep the culture current. This constant cross- fertilization makes assimilation a more complicated process for them than for other minority groups\\". Julie Barak confirms Gonzalez Echevarria‚Äôs assertions regarding Latin American immigration and continues on to demonstrate how the privileged, wealthy existence led by the Garc√≠a girls in the Dominican Republic serves to further complicate their process of assimilation. The girls are vastly unaware of their good fortune until they are faced with the economic hardships of immigration in the United States. How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents confirms the suspicion widely expressed in circles of Latin American literature that North Americans choose not to differentiate between political and economic exile. Alvarez pointedly demonstrates the North American tendency to undervalue cultural diversity by highlighting instances of American ignorance toward distinctions between different Hispanic-Caribbean groups. The Garc√≠a girls are quite conflicted upon their arrival in the United States as they find that distinct cultural groups are lumped together under one broad \\"immigrant\\" category and newcomers are encouraged to assimilate silently to the American norm. Yolanda‚Äôs conflict with her father regarding the potentially controversial speech she has prepared for the Teacher‚Äôs Day Address provides a classic example of the manner in which the Garc√≠a girls are pressured to conform to the norm. Yolanda feels as though she has sacrificed her principles and sold out to the hyper-sensitive authorities when her father forces her to discard her empowering, rebellious achievement of artistic self- expression for \\"two brief pages of stale compliments and the polite commonplaces on teachers. A speech wrought by necessity and without much invention\\". Julie Barak affirms that \\"although this incident is in many ways a defeat for both Yolanda and her mother, it does teach them the lesson of conformity that is so important to living peacefully in America. Yolanda learns to fit in, to do the expected\\". The girls go on to attend the best schools, lose their Spanish accents and acquire the same psychological disorders as their upper-class American counterparts. Sandra battles anorexia, Carla and Yolanda both have failed marriages, Yolanda and Sandra are both institutionalized for psychiatric issues at one time or another, and Sof√≠a is impregnated out of wedlock. =Fear= How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents is rife with the constant presence of fear which manifests itself in a seemingly endless variety of outlets. Alvarez depicts quite vividly the fear evoked in the girls' mother, Laura, near the chronological beginning of the book, as she \\"sees the black V.W. [the trademark of Dominican dictator Trujillo‚Äôs henchmen], and her heart plummets right down to her toes\\". Even after the Garc√≠a family has spent several years in the United States, safe from the threat of Trujillo's retribution, a relentless paranoia continues to plague Carlos, their father, \\"who still lives in fear of the SIM and who is afraid to speak of 'revolt' out loud\\". This initial fear of Carlos' punishment for his role in the attempted assassination of Trujillo is what originally prompted the Garc√≠a family‚Äôs flight from the island and spawned the myriad other fears that would later plague their lives. The conflicted life the daughters would come to lead in the sexually liberated United States would be haunted by the fear of pregnancy and eternal damnation should they allow themselves to be seduced. The Cuban Missile Crisis also becomes a significant source of fear for the girls. In a very brief chapter entitled \\"Snow\\", Alvarez reveals the impact of this widespread cultural paranoia through the character of Yolanda, who mistakes her first experience of snowfall for \\"the beginning of a much anticipated nuclear attack\\", causing a panicked outbreak of general hysteria in her classroom. As they continue to grow and mature, the girls have many disappointing encounters which leave them fearful of the loneliness that must await them in this foreign country where they struggle hopelessly to fit in and be understood. Even as a grown woman, returning to her Dominican roots, Yolanda finds she can never truly escape the fear that has hovered over her for as long as she can remember. This is evident in the very first chapter, \\"Antojos\\", as Alvarez reveals the panic evoked in the adult Yolanda at the sudden realization that she is stranded in a guava field in the Dominican Republic, where women do not go about unchaperoned at night. Alvarez evokes Yolanda's fear as she reports that \\"the rustling leaves of the guava trees echo the warnings of her old aunts: you will get lost, you will get kidnapped, you will get raped, you will get killed\\". As scholar Julie Barak has put it, \\"the vocabulary of fear that accompanies them is not only a part of their Spanish, but also of their English vocabulary\\" and the Garc√≠a family can therefore never hold legitimate hopes of escaping the fear. =Memory= William Luis argues that How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents \\"is an attempt to understand memory, the past and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents\\". Memory plays a significant role in the text, as a means by which the girls can return to the past of their childhood in the attempt to make sense of their present-day realities. The youngest child, Sof√≠a carries with her only a single memory of her brief childhood on the island, in which the Garc√≠a's Haitian maid, Chucha, says a voodoo goodbye to the girls before they leave for the United States. Sof√≠a feels segregated and deprived \\"because she has only this one memory to help her reconstruct her bicultural, bilingual self. Though this lack of memory makes her the least divided of her sisters in many ways... the most disturbed, the most rebellious against her circumstances.\\" Ironically enough, Chucha‚Äôs voodoo prediction itself is largely concerned with the concept of memory, as she insists that after leaving the island the girls \\"will be haunted by what they do and don't remember. But they have spirit in them. They will invent what they need to survive\\". Julie Barak confirms this notion of memory as both a positive and negative force in the Garc√≠a girls‚Äô constant struggle to unearth their true identities. Literary significance and reception When How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents was published in 1991, the book \\"made a resounding splash on the literary scene\\" according to Jonathan Bing in the 1996 Publishers Weekly review of the novel. Although it was her first novel, Alvarez gained significant attention for the book, including a part in the New York Public Library's 1991 exhibit \\"The Hand of the Poet from John Donne to Julia Alvarez\\". The Women's Review of Books also lauds the author, stating that \\"With this first novel, Julia Alvarez joins the rank of other Latina writers such as Nicholasa Mohr and Helena Mar√≠a Viramontes\\". The novel was generally critically acclaimed, with Cecilia Rodr√≠guez Milan√©s of The Women's Review of Books writing that \\"How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents is a noteworthy book, demanding our attention.\\" The Publishers Weekly article notes that \\"the novel provided a keen look at the island social structure they [the Garc√≠a family] wistfully remember and the political turmoil they escaped\\". Since 1991, the book has become widely read and referenced; a well-known part of the canon of Latino literature. Julia Alvarez was awarded the status of Doctor Honoris Causa, Humanidades, by Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica Madre y Maestra, Santiago, Dominican Republic on January 24, 2006 for How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents. In 1999, Library Journal reported that a \\"select cadre of librarians representing New York City's three public library systems have released their hand-picked list of '21 new classics for the 21st century'\\" and the novel was included on the list. A number of scholarly articles and papers have been written on Alvarez's book since its publication, including \\"A Search for Identity in Julia Alvarez's How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents\\" by William Luis and Joan Hoffman's \\"She Wants to be Called Yolanda Now: Identity, Language, and the Third Sister in How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents\\", which was featured in the Bilingual Review.

Ohel Jakob (from Hebrew: \\"Jacob's Tent\\") is a synagogue in Munich, Germany. It was built between 2004 and 2006 as the new main synagogue for the Jewish community in Munich and is located at the Sankt-Jakobs-Platz. The synagogue was inaugurated on 9 November 2006 on the 68th anniversary of the Kristallnacht. The building is part of the new Jewish Center consisting of the synagogue, the Jewish Museum Munich and a community center. Building Ohel Jakob was designed by architects Rena Wandel-Hoefer and Wolfgang Lorch who were awarded the contract after an Architectural design competition on 6 July 2001. The architects had previously completed the New Synagogue in Dresden. The topping out ceremony was celebrated on 25 October 2005. The opening ceremony was led by Charlotte Knobloch, president of Central Council of Jews in Germany and head of Munich's Orthodox Jewish community. The building is a cubic concrete structure clad with travertine stone in its lower part and topped by a glass cube. The glass roof represents a tent (Ohel), symbolizing Moses' 40-year-journey through the desert. The main portal was manufactured in Budapest and features Hebrew letters depicting the Ten Commandments. The interior walls are paneled with warm cedar decorated with golden psalms. The synagogue can seat 550 worshippers. It cost about ‚Ç¨57 million (around US$72 million) to build and funding was provided by the city of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Munich's Jewish community and private donations. Munich's original main synagogue was destroyed in June 1938 and stood a few blocks away from the new synagogue, on ground that is now a parking ramp. In 2003, German authorities uncovered a plot by a group of neo-Nazis to bomb the ceremony to lay the cornerstone for the building. Security concerns also led to the decision to house a memorial, to the more than 4,000 Jews of Munich who were killed in the Holocaust, in a tunnel between the synagogue and the Jewish community center.

The EZW (literally: Protestant Centre for Questions on World Views) is a subdivision of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Located in Berlin, it professes to function as a centralized research, documentation and information center on new religious movements. Hummel is also the author of many books about new religious movements. Hummel studied Protestant theology and received his Ph.D. in 1963 for the thesis \\"Die Auseinandersetzung zwischen Kirche und Judentum im Matth√§usevangelium\\" (literally The dialog between church and Judaism in the gospel of Matthew). Subsequently, he worked as a pastor in Schleswig Holstein. From 1966 until 1972 he led the Lutheranian theological college in Orissa, India. Back in Germany he received a request to research Indian guru movements at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg. He received the right to lecture with his work \\"Indische Mission und neue Fr√∂mmigkeit im Westen. Religi√∂se Bewegungen in westlichen Kulturen‚Äú, (literally: Indian mission and new piety in the West: religious movements in western cultures) that was published by Kohlhammer Verlag. From 1981 until 1994 he was director of the EZW. In his work he disagreed with the concept and explanatory model of Jugendreligion (literally youth religion) for new religious communities, as it was popularized by among others the German author Friedrich-Wilhelm Haack (1935‚Äì1991). In the beginning he fully rejected the controversial use of the German word \\"sekte\\" (that is translated sometimes with \\"cult\\" but also as \\"sect\\" in English), but in his later works he recognized the justification of the concept in differentiated use. He asserted that some of the groups monitored by the EZW had developed both in the society as well as in interfaith dialogue in a positive way, i.e. that they had decreased their original potential for conflict. This assertion was both respected and rejected. It would be especially applicable for the Jehovah's witnesses, the Unification Church, and ISKCON/Hare Krishnas. In spite of this, the Unification Church is still very critical about his assessment of the church.

He first studied under Lorenzo Pasinelli; but he was afterwards instructed in the school of Carlo Cignani. His knowledge of architecture and perspective was considerable; but he excelled in figures. Francesco worked at Piacenza, Parma, and Rome, and then became ducal architect at Mantua. After a stay in Genoa and Naples he was called to Vienna, where he built a large theatre. He worked successively for the Emperors Leopold I and Joseph I, and was invited to Madrid by Philip V, who appointed him his principal architect. He died in 1739. Francesco was known for his theatrical achievements in scenic design. He was the first member of the Bibiena family to build theatres as well as to design sets. In 1700 he completely renovated the theatre in Hofburg, Vienna, for Emperor Leopold I. The large theatre was known as the Gro√üe Kom√∂diensaal (\\"Grand Hall of Comedies\\"), which later became the Court Theater (Burgtheater). The opera house, however, burned down in 1747. The Hoftheater's architecture greatly influenced theatre design in Germany and Austria throughout the first half of the eighteenth century. After a short stay in Italy and in Lorraine, he was invited by Emperor Joseph I, back to the Hofburg, to work as the \\"First Theatrical Engineer\\" and as a scene- painter/decorator from 1709-1712. He was also the architect of the great theatre at Nancy, France; of the Teatro Filarmonico at Verona, which some called the finest theatre in Italy; and of the Teatro Alibert in Rome. In 1726, Francesco returned to Bologna, where he directed the Clementine Academy. Although his father, Giovanni Galli da Bibiena, had a distinguished career, it was Francesco and his older brother Ferdinando that established the family's artistic reputation and its fortune.

Prior to that time, the California Army Guard originated from the state militia established by the Constitution of California in 1849. On April 4, 1850, the first California Legislature in San Jose adopted enabling legislation formally establishing a militia of volunteer or independent companies. The law required every free, white, able-bodied male citizen of the State to perform military duty or to pay a $2 fee for nonperformance of this duty. Such payment exempted the person from duty except in case of war, insurrection, invasion, assistance to the sheriff, or a requisition of the militia. It provided that a judge of the superior court of a county should cause a suitable person to open a book, and enter the names of persons who apply and are able to perform military duty. After required notice, the volunteers were to be organized, and their officers and non-commissioned officers selected by election. The volunteer or independent companies were to be armed and equipped as in the Army of the United States. The units were to adopt a constitution and by-laws as well as rules and regulations for the government of its personnel and determination of fines and penalties to enforce them. The legislature then provided for the organization of these enrolled state militia, volunteers or independent companies into four divisions, each commanded by a major general and consisting of two brigades, with a statewide adjutant general responsible to the Governor of California. From 1852, the Quartermaster General of California was subsumed under the office of Adjutant General of California, when William H. Richardson resigned and Quartermaster General William Chauncey Kibbe became adjutant general by a law of 1852. The first unit, known as the First California Guard (officially Company A, First Regiment, Light Artillery), was formed from volunteers in San Francisco, California under Captain Henry Morris Naglee on July 27, 1849, as a territorial militia. It was the first company organized under state authority. Under these regulations, 307 volunteer or independent companies were organized in the early years of the states history to oppose the Indians, hunt down bandits, quell riots or Vigilantes, protect officials, intervene in mining claim disputes and other civil disturbances. During 1850, Governor Burnett called out the militia two times. The first was prompted by incidents involving the Yuma Indians at the confluence of the Gila and Colorado rivers on April 23, 1850; in response, the Governor ordered the sheriffs of San Diego County and Los Angeles County to organize a total of 100 men for the Gila Expedition to \\"pursue such energetic measures to punish the Indians, bring them to terms, and protect the emigrants on their way to California.\\"[Peter H. Burnett, ‚ÄúGovernor‚Äôs Annual Message to the Legislature, January 7, 1851,‚Äù in Journals of the Senate and Assembly of the State of California, at the Second Session of the Legislature, 1851-1852, (San Francisco: G.K. Fitch & Co., and V.E. Geiger & Co., State Printers, 1852), pp. 16-17.] The second instance occurred in October 1850, when Governor Burnett ordered the sheriff of El Dorado County to muster 200 men. The commanders were instructed to \\"proceed to punish the Indians engaged in the late attacks in the vicinity of Ringgold, and along the emigrant trail leading from Salt Lake to California.\\"[Burnett, ‚ÄúGovernor‚Äôs Annual Message...,1851‚Äú, p. 18.] From 1850 to 1851 the Mariposa Battalion was raised to fight the Mariposa War in the Sierras. In 1851, the Garra Revolt occurred in San Diego County and the Governor called for troops, the Fitzgerald Volunteers were raised in San Diego to defend the County and conducted an expedition to Warners Ranch. Also two companies of Rangers were organized in San Francisco from members of the three militia companies that existed in that city then: First California Guard, Washington Guard and Empire Guard. However, by the time transportation to San Diego was arranged the revolt had been suppressed, and the now idle volunteers caused more trouble in San Diego than the Indians. In 1853, a company of California State Rangers was organized for the purpose of capturing the famous bandit Joaquin Murrieta. At the same time Los Angeles County formed two companies, Los Angeles Rangers and the Los Angeles Guard. In 1854 the Monte Rangers were formed. During 1855 in San Bernardino County the San Bernardino Rough and Ready Cavalry was formed, replaced in 1856 by the San Bernardino Rangers. These units were raised to support the local authorities in combating Indian raids and the influx of criminals into Southern California, driven out of the northern part of the state by vigilantism in San Francisco and the Gold Country. \\"Following the great uprisings in San Francisco, there was a general exodus of crimmals to the interior. A San Francisco paper thus sounds the note of warning: :\\"The recent hanging and banishing of the friends and companions of these villains in San Francisco caused a stampede for the interior and southern portion of the state, where they formed themselves into organized banditti, robbing and murdering indiscriminately. Neither sex nor age were regarded by these desperate gangs of marauders. ... the law was found to be inefficient to punish the bloody outrages which were daily being committed; the people in the lower counties, in Los Angeles, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, and later still in Carson Valley, have been obliged in self-defence to follow the example of San Francisco ...\\" In 1854, the six companies in San Francisco, were formed into a battalion. In 1855, the militia was again reorganized. Provision was made for six divisions and 12 brigades. More extended military rolls were to be kept by the county assessors of each county. In 1855, six California militia units were raised or mobilized in Humboldt and Klamath Counties for defense of the inhabitants in the Klamath and Salmon River War. In 1856, Tulare Mounted Riflemen, a California State Militia unit of Tulare County, fought the Yokut in the Tule River War. In the winter in early 1858, a number of militia companies were raised for the Utah War, which was settled in by that spring before they could become involved. In 1858-59, Captain Isaac G. Messec and his company, the Trinity Rangers fought the Klamath & Humboldt Expedition against the Whilkut or Redwood Indians. In 1859, the Kibbe Rangers under William Byrnes and local posses fought the Pitt River Expedition against the Achomawi (Pit River) and Atsugewi (Hat Creek) tribes. In 1860 the Independent City Guard and another company of volunteers from Sacramento, and the Nevada Rifles from Nevada City joined the Washoe Regiment and fought in the Carson River Expedition in the Paiute War. =Civil War= As the secession crisis developed in early 1861, several Volunteer Companies of the California Militia had disbanded because of divided loyalties and new ones with loyal Union men were sworn in across the state under the supervision of County sheriffs and judges. Many of these units saw no action but some were to form the companies of the earliest California Volunteer Regiments. Others like the Petaluma Guard and Emmet Rifles in Sonoma County suppressed a secessionist disturbance in Healdsburg, in 1862. Union commanders relied on the San Bernardino Mounted Rifles to hold the pro southern San Bernardino County for the Union in late 1861 as federal troops were being withdrawn and replaced by California Volunteers. Notable as the only active pro-Southern militia unit, the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles was organized on March 7, 1861, in Los Angeles County. It included more than a few Californios in its leadership and its ranks including the County Sheriff, one of his Undersheriffs and several of his deputies. A. J. King another Undersheriff of Los Angeles County (and former member of the earlier \\"Monte Rangers\\") and other influential men in El Monte, formed another secessionist militia the Monte Mounted Rifles on March 23, 1861. However, the attempt failed when A. J. King marched through the streets following news of the Battle of Fort Sumter with a portrait of the Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard and was arrested by a U.S. Marshal. State arms sent from Governor John G. Downey for the unit were held up by Union officers at the port of San Pedro. Due to the activities of secessionists within companies and disappearance of arms with the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles, the Legislature passed a law giving the Governor the power to recover from any company its arms and equipment to prevent traitors from getting possession of state arms. In 1862, the crisis of the American Civil War compelled the militia to be reorganized. Volunteer companies were to be reorganized, classified, assigned to militia battalions and regiments and staffs were to be provided to them. Administration was improved, bonds required, military duty exacted, enrollments and assessments created, muster rolls defined, activation of the militia determined, disciplinary procedure adopted, courts-martial provided, compensation fixed, arms and equipment provided, and prior conflicting acts repealed. During the Civil War 88 militia companies had been formed to serve, if required, in their respective localities, or to respond to a call from the governor. However, by the end of the Civil War only two of the six Divisions were active and only six of the twelve Brigades of which only the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Brigades were organized into battalions and regiments. =Later 19th Century= In 1866, the Legislature for the first time employed the term \\"National Guard\\" as the title of the organized uniformed troops of the State of California. The statute provided for the organization of the National Guard, General and Special Staffs, formations of companies, service, arms and equipment, created a Board of Organization, formed a Board of Military Auditors, adopted a system of instruction and drill, described in detail the duties of the Adjutant General, created privileges and exemptions, allowances and expenses, limited the issuance of arms to troops only, provided for military musters and active service. =Early 20th Century= The Militia Act of 1903 organized the various state militias into the present National Guard system. Between the wars the 79th Infantry Brigade existed in the state, with the 159th and 184th Infantry Regiments. The California Army National Guard played an important role in World War II. One of the most illustrious California military units, the 40th Infantry Division, fought against the Imperial Japanese in the Pacific. California's 184th Infantry Regiment also fought in the Pacific Theater. The 40th Tank Company took part in the defense of Luzon, but was forced to surrender at Bataan. CA National Guard units also found themselves in the European theater of the war. The 144th Field Artillery Group and 159th Infantry Regiment both fought in one of the most infamous battles of the war, the Battle of the Bulge. Soon after World War II the 49th Infantry Division was organized in the state, but it disappeared after later reorganization. On February 1, 1976, the 49th Infantry Brigade, California Army National Guard, was redesignated the 49th MP Brigade at Alameda, California.Secretary of Defense William Cohen talks with soldiers from a California Army National Guard unit = Post World War II = As the Vietnam War escalated, increased personnel requirements in Southeast Asia necessitated mobilizations and deployments of Army National Guard units. California was not exempt from this. Both 1st Squadron, 18th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 40th Aviation Company received mobilization orders. Despite being trained at Fort Lewis, Washington, the 18th Armored Cavalry never went to Vietnam. Instead, their gear was equipped to units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. The 18th Armored Cavalry was sent back to California, though many of its members went on to serve in Vietnam. Units and members of the California Army National Guard have served in: World War I, World War II, Korean War, the Vietnam War, Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, Sinai Peninsula, Qatar, Germany, Spain, Panama, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait, during the L.A. Riots, on the US/Mexico Border mission, during Hurricane Katrina humanitarian efforts, in airports and seaports around California, in various military bases across the US in support of Homeland Security, and more.  Modern Day Mission  = Global War on Terror = California Army National Guard units have played an active role in the Middle East since the U.S. military increased its involvement in the region. In September 2017, about 300 Army National Guard soldiers of the 184th Infantry Battalion deployed to Jordan to take part in Operation Spartan Shield. Modesto's 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry Regiment is one of the most active California Army National Guard units, having been mobilized or deployed to Kosovo, Iraq, and Jordan within the past decade. Black Hawk helicopter from the 140th Aviation Regiment drops water on a camp fire, November 14, 2018 Most recently, March 2019 saw the return of the CA ARNG's 40th Infantry Division from a 9-month tour in Afghanistan. This was the second rotation of troops to return from Afghanistan, and the 40th Infantry Division's first combat deployment since the Korean War. = Natural Disaster Relief = California has been hit with several major natural disasters in recent years. As with any state guard, one of the California Army National Guard's primary tasks is to ensure the safety of its citizens in times of crisis. According to the CA ARNG's website, the Guard is \\"committed to improving, preparing and protecting our communities, state and nation\\". In dealing with the recent Camp Fire, California activated 700 soldiers in different support roles. Fires are some of the most common and devastating natural disasters in California, causing units like the 140th Aviation Regiment to be used to support fire department efforts. Military police officers and soldiers are also utilized in massive evacuation efforts such as those taking place during the Camp Fire.

It is named after the Swiss ophthalmologist Victor Morax. The organisms are short rods, coccobacilli, or as in the case of Moraxella catarrhalis, diplococci in morphology, with asaccharolytic, oxidase-positive, and catalase-positive properties.Ala'Aldeen, D. A. A. (2007). \\"Neisseria and moraxella\\". In Greenwood, David; Slack, Richard; Peitherer, John; & Barer, Mike (Eds.), Medical Microbiology (17th ed.), p. 258. Elsevier. . M. catarrhalis is the clinically most important species under this genus. Roles in disease The organisms are commensals of mucosal surfaces and sometimes give rise to opportunistic infection. * M. catarrhalis usually resides in respiratory tract, but can gain access to the lower respiratory tract in patients with chronic chest disease or compromised host defenses, thus causing tracheobronchitis and pneumonia. For example, it causes a significant proportion of lower respiratory tract infections in elderly patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis. It is also one of the notable causes of otitis media and sinusitis. It causes similar symptoms to Haemophilus influenzae, although it is much less virulent. Unlike Neisseria meningitidis, which is a morphological relative of M. catarrhalis, it hardly ever causes bacteremia or meningitis. * Moraxella lacunata is one of the causes of blepharoconjunctivitis in human. * Moraxella bovis is the cause of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis, known colloquially in the United Kingdom as New Forest eye. As a strict aerobe, M. bovis is confined to the cornea and conjunctiva, resulting in a progressive, nonself-limiting keratitis, ulceration, and ‚Äì ultimately ‚Äì rupture of the cornea. The disease is relatively common, infecting cattle only. Treatment is the use of either subconjunctival injection of a tetracycline, or topical application of cloxacillin, the former being more effective. The bacterium can be transmitted by flies, so fly control may be necessary on farms throughout the summer. Rupture of the eye is more serious, and requires immediate enucleation, though the procedure itself carries a good prognosis.

Italian designer, became the most distinguished artist of the Galli da Bibiena family. \\"Bibiena, Galli da, Family\\" (history), Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, 18-November-2006, Britannica.com webpage: EB- Bibienas. Life He was born in Parma, the second son of Ferdinando Galli Bibiena. In 1708, Ferdinando was called to Barcelona by Charles III of Habsburg to help organize and decorate his wedding to Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, Queen of Prussia and Giuseppe accompanied him. Later Giuseppe traveled with his father to the courts of Charles VI the Holy Roman Emperor (reigned 1711-1740) who hired Fernando to be the court's scenographer and painter. There, when his father left in 1717, he became the chief organizer of the court festivities and official functions and named \\"His Majesty's Second Theatrical Engineer\\". It was not until 1723 that Giuseppe was officially promoted to \\"His Majesty's First Theatrical Engineer\\" and kept the position until 1747. After receiving his position in court, Giuseppe became involved in decorating all the Habsburgs' celebratory festivities. He did parties, weddings, funerals, painted in monasteries and various countries. He also did work for religious venues as in Melk Abbey (Pulpit and High Altar) and in Prague when he built a decorative arch in 1729 for the celebration of John of Nepomuk. His younger brother Antonio Galli Bibiena was also hired by the Vienna court and worked alongside Giuseppe. Together Antonio and Giuseppe designed theater decorations and for festivities in Vienna, also Linz, Graz, and Prague (1723 \\"Costanza e Fortezza\\" at Hradƒçany castle). The death of Charles VI in 1740 made a significant shift in Giuseppe Bibiena's career. Charles VI's daughter and successor Maria Theresa did not see theatre as representative of her reign as her father did. Especially after her marriage to Francis I, his French tastes overturned Italian prominence in the Vienna court. Giuseppe stayed in Vienna, organized Maria Theresa's wedding and festivities and still continued to find various jobs in the area, but his significance in the Vienna court diminished. This caused Giuseppe to take various jobs outside Vienna. In 1753 Giuseppe was hired by Frederick the Great of Prussia in his court in Berlin. There Giuseppe spent the last three years of his life and died at the age of 61 on March 12, 1757. Works ::* in 1722, Giuseppe Galli Bibiena worked in Munich ::* in 1723, he designed religious venues in Prague ::* in 1735, he designed the Pulpit and High Altar for The Abbey Church, Melk Abbey ::* in 1742, he designed the decorations for the Vienna state opera ::* in 1744, he designed the interior of the Margrave's Opera House at Bayreuth ::* in 1747, Giuseppe was employed at the opera in Dresden, Saxony ::* in 1750, he renovated the Dresden opera (which burned in 1849) ::* in 1751, Giuseppe received occasional orders from Friedrich the Great ::* in 1753, worked permanently for Friedrich the Great in Berlin. Style Giuseppe's innovation in theatre and in architecture embodied the Baroque/Classical style of the time period. His designs focused on detail, majesty, grandeur, and demonstrated a classical theme which was considered ‚Äútrue art‚Äù in the society of that time. Because of this, Giuseppe thrived as an artist. Although most of Giuseppe's designs were made to be temporary and are no longer accessible, many of his drawings were published. His efforts to combine architecture and painting through the perspective can easily be seen in three series of engravings: Alcina (in 1716), Costanza e Fortezza (1723 \\"Constancy and Fortitude\\"); and Architetture e prospettive (1740 \\"Architecture and Perspective\\"). The baroque style and attention to detail made the Bibiena style of scenography stand out. The multifaceted backdrops gave the audience a more realistic experience and added to the overall aesthetic of the play or opera. They not only impacted the scenery designs inside the theatre but also the architecture of the theatre itself.

Retrieved January 5, 2007.), one of a few species known as paperwhite, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region, from Greece to Portugal plus Morocco and Algeria. The species is considered naturalized in the Azores, Corsica, Texas, California and Louisiana.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families The white flowers are borne in bunches and are strongly fragrant. It is frequently grown as a house plant, often forced to flower at Christmas. Paperwhites are part of the genus Narcissus which includes plants known as daffodils. Description The stems are mid-green and grow upright. Mature height is usually 1‚Äì1.5 ft (30‚Äì45 cm), though this varies by variety. Several white flowers are borne at the top of each stem and are strongly scented.Ker Gawler, John Bellenden. 1806. Botanical Magazine 24: pl. 947. Cultivation Many cultivars are available and are easy to force into bloom indoors. Unlike other Narcissus species, paperwhites do not require chilling to promote bloom. The bulbs begin to grow as soon as they are planted, with flowers appearing in 3‚Äì4 weeks. Narcissus papyraceus thrives in moist, peat moss based potting mix. Plants can also be grown in containers of water. Cool temperatures between and indirect light will help to prolong the bloom time.

The beams are mixed together and focused onto a photomixer device which generates the terahertz radiation. It is technologically significant because there are few sources capable of providing radiation in this waveband, others include frequency multiplied electronic/microwave sources, quantum cascade laser and ultrashort pulsed lasers with photoconductive switches as used in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The advantages of this technique are that it is continuously tunable over the frequency range from 300 GHz to 3 THz (10 cm‚àí1 to 100 cm‚àí1) (1 mm to 0.1 mm), and spectral resolutions in the order of 1 MHz can be achieved. However, the achievable power is on the order of 10‚àí8 W.  Principle  Two continuous wave lasers with identical polarisation are required, the lasers with frequency œâ1 and œâ2 are spatially overlapped to generate a terahertz beatnote. The co-linear lasers are then used to illuminate an ultra fast semiconductor material such as GaAs. The photonic absorption and the short charge carrier lifetime results in the modulation of the conductivity at the desired terahertz frequency œâTHz = œâ1 \\\\- œâ2. An applied electric field allows the conductivity variation to be converted into a current which is radiated by a pair of antenna. A typical photoconductive device or 'photomixer' is made from low temperature GaAs with a patterned metalized layer which is used to form an electrode array and radiating antenna.  High resolution spectrometer  The photomixing source can then form the basis of a laser spectrometer which can be used to examine the THz signature of various subjects such as gases, liquids or solid materials. The instrument can be divided into the following functional units: * Laser sources which provide a THz beatnote in the optical domain. These are usually two near infrared lasers and maybe an optical amplifier. * The photomixer device converts the beatnote into THz radiation, often emitted into free space by an integrated antenna. * A THz propagation path, depending on the application suitable focusing elements are used to collimate the THz beam and allow it to pass through the sample under study. * Detector, with the relatively low levels of available power, in the order of 1 ¬µW, a sensitive detector is required to ensure a reasonable signal to noise ratio. Si bolometers provide a solution for in-coherent instruments. Alternatively a second photomixer device can be used as a detector and has the advantage of allowing coherent detection.

History  Prior to 1969 the school was known as Menomonee Falls High School. The school colors were purple and white, the mascot was the Indians, the school newspaper was known as \\"The Harmony\\" until 1961 when it became The Chieftain, and the yearbook was The Periscope. The class of 1969 was the last graduation class from Menomonee Falls High. In 1969 when a second high school was built to serve the growing population, the original high school was renamed Menomonee Falls North and the new school was known as Menomonee Falls East. The school colors were Blue and Gold, the mascot was the Titans, the yearbook was the Javelin. The school district returned to having one high school in the 1983‚Äì84 school year, with Menomonee Falls North High School becoming Menomonee Falls North Middle School. The class of 1984 was the last class graduating from Menomonee Falls North High. In 2010, the freshman class was added to the high school, instead of being a part of the junior high. That same year, the village voted to update and expand the facilities. Updates included a new gym, and administration and science wings totaling 71,600 square feet. On December 9, 2019, the Menomonee Falls School Board voted 5‚Äì2 to retire the \\"Indians\\" nickname and mascot at the conclusion of the 2019‚Äì20 school year. This was met with much controversy as the new naming selection process was deemed as unfair by many in the community.

He lives in France.Future Sound of London : Music News Feature  Clash Music Background Cobain was born on 16 May 1967 in Bedford. He left Bedford for Manchester in his late teens to study at a time when alternative music in that part of Britain was taking off; the dance music scene in particular was becoming more and more popular, not just in Manchester but all over the country and in the States too. Cobain, drawn to the city by bands like The Chameleons and The Smiths, embraced this atmosphere and joined a band he had seen rehearsing in a studio and stayed with them for a year; after his spell with that band he met Brian Dougans. Music After meeting Dougans they both started discussing their shared interest in electronic music and began to work together on small projects; Cobain then left the college to build his own studio on an Enterprise Allowance Course and he and Dougans began to release tracks under aliases such as Mental Cube and Art Science Technology, some of these early singles would be compiled onto Earthbeat (1992). His first big collaboration with Dougans was on \\"Stakker Humanoid\\", which went on to be a chart hit at a time when acid house in particular was becoming popular. The pair then released their first single as The Future Sound of London (FSOL) \\"Papua New Guinea\\" which also became a hit in clubs across Britain and the States. They signed with Virgin Records but remained independent artistically, something they have always fought for and achieved; Cobain puts this down to them already having a few hits under their belts (\\"Papua New Guinea\\" in particular) before they signed with the major label. Cobain has always been the more vocal member of the band and always speaks for them in interviews with Dougans sometimes interjecting on a certain point; Cobain has said that FSOL is a combination of opposites, the roles of masculine and feminine are central to the FSOL ethos and Cobain has said that in the band he represents the melody and softness as opposed to Dougans representing technology, machines and programming; it is the marriage of these forces, Cobain says, that makes FSOL work the way it does, especially with the Amorphous Androgynous of the new millennium where progressive rock and psychedelica were embraced. The new incarnation of Amorphous Androgynous is very much Cobain's new vehicle for the expression of his energy whilst still releasing their more electronic-based music as FSOL. He has stated that he is influenced philosophically by Laozi, Buddha and Jiddu Krishnamurti and that he likes the bands Secret Chiefs 3, Mercury Rev and Simian among many others.PopMatters Music Interview  Song of the Mellow Hippo: An Interview with Future Sound of London References External links * *An in-depth interview with him from 2006 Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bedford Category:British dance musicians Category:English new-age musicians Category:English experimental musicians Category:Intelligent dance musicians Category:Remixers Category:Breakbeat musicians ","title":"Garry Cobain"},{"id":"8002920","text":"Chris Wilson (born July 10, 1982) is a Canadian football defensive end who is currently a free agent.

Location The town is located in Mwatate sub-county, approximately , north-west of Mwatate, where the county headquarters are located. This is about west of Voi, the largest town in the county. This is about south-east of Nairobi, the capital and largest city in Kenya. Bura is located about north-west of the post-city of Mombasa, on the Indian Ocean coast. The coordinates of Bura, Taita-Taveta County are: 03¬∞27'11.0\\"S, 38¬∞18'44.0\\"E (Latitude:-3.453050; Longitude:38.312222).  Overview  Bura is situated in the Taita Hills. The geography is quite diverse, extending from the grassy fields, swamps and acacia forest of the plains, to dense patches of forest surrounded by semi-terraced farms on the steep hillsides. The climate of the area is strongly affected by its proximity to the ocean. The climate varies with the altitude. The lowlands are generally hot and dry, while the hills receive more rainfall and cooler temperatures. The most extensively grown agricultural crops are corn and beans. Those who live in the dry lowland areas like Zare, Bura Station(Ng'ambwa) and Mwashuma grow millet, as it is drought resistant and does well in poor soil. Rice is grown in swampy areas like Barawa and Nyolo. On the cool hillsides like Bura Mission, Saghaighu, Tungulu, Mlambenyi and Dawida one finds banana groves. Those who are able to irrigate their land produce most of the vegetables grown in the area. These crops include tomato, cabbage and green pepper and they are marketed primarily in Mombasa. Other small-scale crops include cassava, sweet potato, citrus, pea, mango and sugar cane. Most farmers cannot afford farm machinery. They farm with hoes and hands.  History  The people of Bura are predominantly of the Taita (Dawida) ethnic group, speaking the Dawida language as their mother tongue. The ancestors of the Bura Taita were said to have migrated from Lewa in Tanzania, in search of land for grazing and cultivation. They settled initially in the hills to grow crops, while maintaining plots of land in the lower region for others. Family members migrated seasonally to care for the farms and graze livestock. Game meat was plentiful and honey was harvested using traditional methods. Several forces have largely destroyed the systems that the Bura people established to meet their needs while caring for their natural surroundings. In the late 1800s, Catholic missionaries came from the coast and confiscated 1000 acres of the best agricultural land. The Catholic Missionaries then built a Church which is currently over a century old but a new church has since been built to the right of the old one. Many farmers moved away from their productive farms in search of land in the dry and bushy lowlands when this happened. Others resisted the Mission, and eventually it returned parts of the land that it had taken. The Mission was most generous with those who converted to Catholicism, urging them to settle on the best pieces of land surrounding the Mission, disregarding original settlers. In the 1960s and 1970s, tourism began to emerge as Kenya's leading industry. Jomo Kenyatta, the president, generously offered a huge tract of land in this area to a European friend. This became the Taita Hills Wildlife Reserve and the Salt Lick Lodge. Hunting and killing of wild animals was criminalized, but little was done to protect the farmers from the animals. The result is that animals such as elephant and buffalo freely roam the lowlands destroying crops, uprooting fruit trees and endangering lives. The resulting insecurity keeps farmers from undertaking certain activities such as planting trees. It also means that large amounts of labor are required to guard crops, particularly at night. The 1970s was a period of land demarcation. Private ownership of land became the rule and land was consolidated to settle families on individual tracts. Families could no longer depend on small tracts (shambas) in several areas as they had in the past. Consolidation means that a family must now depend on one piece of land to meet its needs. If that piece fails, the family faces hunger. Cooperation between family members has been affected; as nuclear families and their private land has replaced extended families managing larger and more diverse pieces of cornrnunal land. Conflicts have arisen as some acquired land in the most productive areas while others were consolidated on their least productive lands. Environmental degradation has increased as people are forced to cultivate on marginal land and destroy areas of ecological importance.  Infrastructure  There are three health centers in the location including Sagaighu, Bura Station(Ng'ambwa) and the Mission. The first two are government operated, while the latter is a private clinic run by the church. There is a police base near the Mission, and another outpost at the Chiefs camp. The predominant religion is Catholicism. but the Anglican Church has a small following and plans are underway for the construction of an Anglican church. There are many schools, primary, secondary, and a teacher's college. Bura Primary school has 272 students from pre-school to class eight. Bura Location has many schools and other institutions. There are ten primary schools, three high schools, a vocational center for the disabled, a polytechnic school and a private teachers' training college. There are plans underway to construct another secondary school in the lower region. Bura is served by a station on the branch railway to Voi.

Built in 1749 CE by Ahom king Pramatta Singha, in memory of his father Swargadeo Rudra Singha, the temple is a fine example of a mixed style of Ahom-Mughal architecture. Rudreswar Devaloya in North Guwahati Rudreswar Devaloya in North Guwahati History In the latter part of his reign, Swargadeo Rudra Singha announced his desire to expand Assam westward as far as the river Karatoya in present- day West Bengal and Bangladesh, which was considered the frontier of the ancient Kamarupa kingdom. Some sources also indicate that his ambition was to include a portion of the sacred Ganga river within his domain. Since Bengal was under the rule of the Mughals, he began to prepare for a massive military expedition against the Mughal Empire. An army of approximately 400,000 soldiers gathered in Guwahati, in which various tribes from the hills and plains came together, including the king of Cachar and the king of Jaintia from present day Meghalaya. His efforts were in vain. Before his preparations were completed he was seized with a mortal illness and died in August 1714 in his camp at Guwahati. His body was taken to Charaideo, in present-day Sivasagar District, for burial as per ancient Tai-Ahom custom.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta page 180-181. According to some sources, Rudra Singha was cremated according to Hindu customs in North Guwahati, while some denote only one of his small fingers was burnt in this way.Sarma Siva Mahatirtha Asom published by Utpal Hazarika on behalf of Bani Mandir first edition 2007 Guwahati pp 93-94. His second son, Pramatta Singha, after ascending to the throne, decided to construct in Guwahati a temple to Lord Shiva in memory of his father. The site of his father's death was selected for the construction of the temple.Neog Dr. Maheswar Pavitra Asam or The Sacred Assam 4th edition 2008 Kiran Prakashan, Dhemaji page 264-265. The temple was completed in 1749. After the completion of the temple, Pramatta Singha established a Shiva Linga in the temple and named it Rudreswar Shiva Linga, after his father Swargadeo Rudra Singha. The temple was named Rudreswar Devalaya and hence the village on which the temple was constructed is also known as Rudreswar. The king made arrangements for priests and people to maintain the temple and a donated large area of land in the name of the temple. Design and structure The temple was constructed using the architectural design of both Ahom and Mughals. The design of the temple is an imitation of the Mughal mausoleum. The temple has underground chambers whose entrances are present at the front side of the temple. Rudreswar Temple entrance to underground chambersIt is not known precisely why these underground chambers were constructed, but, one can assume it was constructed for storing foods and other necessary items required for daily functioning of the temple. The Manikut (literally the jewel hut) or the chamber where the Shiva linga was present, is constructed above the underground chambers. Drainage system along with air ventilation system can also be seen in the structure of the temple. The temple was surrounded by a brick wall from all sides. The wall had two stone inscriptions of Ahom period which are presently preserved in museum. There is pond near the temple which is known as Konwari pukhuri or pond for the princess (Konwari in Assamese language refers to princess or queens of the kings). According to local people, the pond was used for bathing by the queens and princesses of Ahom king Rudra Singha when he was camping here for the military expedition of Bengal and hence the pond got its name. Konwari Pukhuri near Rudreswar TempleTowards east from Konwari Pukhuri, another pair of ponds existed known as Hiloidari Pukhuri or the ponds of the artillery-men and musketeers(Hiloidari in Assamese language means musketeers or soldiers engaged in artillery).Notice of ASI in English in Rudreswar Temple Upper terrace of Rudreswar Temple Present day After the fall of Ahom Kingdom and establishment of British rule in Assam, the temple lost much of its lands and other privileges. It suffered greatly in the 1897 Assam and 1950 Assam‚ÄìTibet earthquakes. The temple's upper structure suffered tremendous damages. The local people, in a bid to preserve the temple, constructed the Manikut or the chamber where main religious function is held, roughly by woods and tins, to continue their religious functions. Later the temple came under the preservation of Archaeological Society of India (ASI) and the Government of Assam is also taking several steps for the restoration of the temple but still the construction is not yet complete.

The film is set in Incheon in South Korea. A murder is committed, and the cops search for the killer. Opening up in monochrome but with occasional flashes of colour, the first action scene is a disorientating strobe-like affair. From there the movie proceeds in color, with many innovative editing techniques, including slow-motion, jump cut, step-printed slow motion, \\"jump dissolves,\\" still frames, and layering images on top of one another.

It is spread by direct contact or by flies serving as vectors. It is the most common ocular disease of cattle (mostly beef). IBK is similar to human pink eye and causes severe infection of the conjunctiva, edema, corneal opacity, and ulceration. This disease is highly contagious and occurs worldwide. Younger animals are more susceptible, but recovery with minimal damage is usual, if they are treated early. Cause Moraxella bovis is a Gram-negative rod-shaped aerobe. This bacterium is an obligate intracellular parasite of the mucous membranes, and can usually be isolated from the respiratory tract, vagina, and conjunctiva of healthy animals. Transmission of IBK is through direct contact with mucous membranes and their secretions and indirect contact where flies act as a mechanical vector. Asymptomatic carrier animals can also be source of infection. Predisposing factors Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is implicated in cattle with no pigmentation around the eyelids and cattle with prominently placed eyes. Exudate from the sun-burnt skin around the eyes can contain bacteria and attracts flies. UV light also directly damages the corneal epithelium, leading to a breakdown in host innate immunity. Dust, dried-up plants, tall vegetation, and oversized or incorrectly placed ear tags may cause mechanical damage to the eye and facilitate bacterial colonization. The disease may be complicated by concurrent infection with viruses such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (bovine herpesvirus 1) or adenovirus, bacteria such as Mycoplasma boviculi or Listeria monocytogenes, or infestation by Thelazia, a nematode. Vitamin A deficiency is also implicated. IBK is most prevalent in summer and early autumn. A recent Meat and Livestock Australia report \\"estimates that the disease costs Australian beef producers AU$23.5 million annually in lost production and treatment costs\\". Clinical signs and diagnosis The bacteria invade the lacrimal glands of the eye, causing keratitis, uveitis, and corneal ulceration. Cattle show signs of pain, increased lacrimation, excessive blinking, and conjunctivitis. More severe cases may show systemic signs such as anorexia and weight loss. Chronic untreated cases can become blind. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical signs, but the bacteria can be cultured from lacrimal swabs, or visualised on smears of lacrimal secretions. Treatment and control Shade, insect repellent-impregnated ear tags, and lower stocking rates may help prevent IBK. Early identification of the disease also helps prevent spread throughout the herd. Treatment is with early systemic use of a long-acting antibiotic such as tetracycline or florfenicol. Subconjunctival injections with procaine penicillin or other antibiotics are also effective, providing a \\"bubble\\" of antibiotic which releases into the eye slowly over several days. Anti- inflammatory therapy can help shorten recovery times, but topical corticosteroids should be used with care if corneal ulcers are present. M. bovis uses several different serotyped fimbriae as virulence factors, consequently pharmaceutical companies have exploited this to create vaccines. However, currently available vaccines are not reliable.  Vaccination  A vaccine, known as \\"Piliguard\\", is available in Australia. The vaccine contains three strains of Morexella bovis (SAH38, FLA 64, EPP 63) pilli antigen. This stimulates antibody production against the bacterial pilli to prevent their attachment and invasion of the conjunctiva. The company claims the vaccine reduces the incidence and severity of the disease in an individual animal which directly reduces animal suffering and production loss on top of limiting the spread of disease through the herd. This, in turn, reduces the amount of antibioitcs and fly repellent needed during high-risk seasons. The vaccine is marketed in multidose vials and has an adjuvant to create a long-term subcutaneous depot. This means no booster shot is necessary, but severe local reaction can be seen in people who accidentally inoculate themselves. Calves as young as one week old can be treated and no meat, milk, or export slaughter withdrawal is needed.

The roadway follows Manistique Lakes Road from Gould City at a junction with US Highway 2 (US 2) near Lake Michigan north to M-28 near McMillan. The northern section of the highway is also called County Road 135 (CR 135) in Luce County. From 1929 until 1960, the road was part of the state highway system as M-135. The northern end of the highway always contained a section that ran concurrently with M-98, another state highway in the area. For a period in the 1950s, M-135 had a different northern terminus separate from M-98's endpoint. A few years before both highways were removed from the highway system, M-135 was moved to use M-98's terminus with M-28. Since the 1970s, M-135 has been a part of the county-designated highway system and assigned the number H-33, a moniker it has borne since. Route description H-33 begins at an intersection with US 2 just west of Gould City. From there the route travels due north through woodlands on Manistique Lakes Road, passing by Mitten and South Manistique lakes. The road crosses Norton and Strom creeks near South Manistique Lake before entering the community of Curtis. In that town, H-33 intersects the eastern end of H-42. North of Curtis, H-33 passes Manistique Lake as the road crosses the Mackinac‚ÄìLuce county line. North of the line, H-33 has also been designated CR 135 by the Luce County Road Commission. Continuing north, the roadway enters the community of Helmer where it meets a junction with the eastern terminus of the eastern H-44 (CR 98, Ten Curves Road) near North Manistique Lake. The roadway also crosses Locke Creek, which flows into that lake. After H-33 leaves Helmer, it continues northward to a junction with North Road Lake Road (CR 438) and Sampsell Road (CR 417). Manistique Lakes Road turns to the east, replacing North Round Lake Road, and H-33 follows suit. The road continues to a junction with M-28 just south of McMillan near East Lake. There H-33 terminates near farms and several small business. History In 1929, M-135 was designated, creating the concurrency along the last several miles of M-98. In late 1949 or early 1950, M-28 was realigned to take an angled route southeasterly out of McMillan. The east‚Äìwest section of the previous M-28 routing was added to M-98 while the north‚Äìsouth segment was added to M-135. By the middle of 1958, M-135 was shifted to follow M-98, removing the roadway section added to its routing previously; this change made M-98 and M-135 concurrent north of Helmer all the way to M-28 once again. M-135 was removed from the state trunkline system in late 1960 or early 1961, and the designation was decommissioned at that time. The M-135 designation has not been reused since. The routing was then assigned as County Road H-33 after October 5, 1970, The road has retained that designation ever since.

Samuel Oughton (1803 ‚Äì December 1881), Baptist missionary to Jamaica 1836‚Äì1866, and colleague of William Knibb, was an abolitionist who became an outspoken advocate of black labour rights in Jamaica during the gradual abolition of slavery in the late 1830s and thereafter. He was briefly imprisoned in Jamaica during 1840. Originally associated with James Sherman's Independent Congregational Surrey Chapel, and from time to time invited back by Sherman, he was closely associated with the Baptists in Jamaica, who were largely organised along Congregational lines and among the predominantly African-Caribbean population, following their founding by George Lisle, a former slave from America. Early life in Jamaica Samuel Oughton's work for the Baptist Missionary Society in Jamaica, soon became well known. Arriving in 1836 from the Surrey Chapel in London, his posting was initially to help Thomas Burchell, a relative by marriage. However, by 1839 he was invited by the largely African congregation in Kingston to be their pastor at the prominent East Queen Street chapel. This was a key time in the emancipation of Jamaican slaves. After \\"legal abolition\\" began in Jamaica with the home government's Emancipation Act of 1833, conditions were little better for many Africans in Jamaica for some decades; particularly under the dreaded \\"indentured apprenticeship\\" system of forced labour, which was taken to extremes by the Planters, some masters and their overseers compelling the use of treadmills. The abuses of indentured apprenticeship were finally abolished on 1 August 1838, following a campaign led by Joseph Sturge, with support from the Baptists, the Anti-Slavery Society, and longstanding abolitionists such as William Allen. Even so, emancipation was no paradise; the planters frequently harassed tenants (see Free Villages, and sought to drive down wages when they could. Oughton once famously remarked to his flock in the parish of Hanover: For a time (during 1840) he was imprisoned by the Jamaican authorities for his outspoken views against liberties being taken by magistrates against African women. Back in Britain, Joseph Sturge of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society passed on Oughton's descriptions of the horrendous labour practices suffered by Africans in Jamaica, which Oughton continued to communicate whilst in prison. Joseph Sturge made representations to the Colonial Office on his behalf and Samuel Oughton was eventually discharged after a period released on bail. He records \\"simple but ardent expressions of delight and affection\\" from \\"our poor dear people\\", who welcomed him back to East Queen Street chapel with renewed hope. In 1841 Oughton was able to write: \\"my affection for the people, and theirs for me, seems to grow stronger by the day\\". The Baptist returns at about this date show Samuel Oughton, assisted by George Rowse, to be responsible for three \\"sub stations\\", two \\"day schools\\", two \\"Sunday schools\\", and, besides Rowse, two further teachers - Miss Simpson, and W.Spraggs. Oughton's moral code In the 1844 elections Oughton was active in promoting African candidates, and most of his congregation were of African origin. He stayed at East Queen Street chapel as pastor for the next twenty years, although not without incident since he promoted a form of moral code that he applied to everyone, including the emancipated citizens whose status he had been invited to improve. The legal status of one Baptist chapel was often slightly different from another since they had grown up in many ways. At one time George Lisle's chapel was his personal responsibility, and he was imprisoned for an outstanding debt on its construction. The more appropriate scheme of ownership was through some form of trust deed. Whilst Oughton supported the congregation's right to appoint trustees at one Chapel where this issue arose, the wish of his own congregation to do likewise at the East Queen Street Chapel became a cause of controversy since it had a different constitution. Oughton also faced a problem because all its trustees but one had died before dutifully appointing others, and so it became inquorate. Just as he had exposed wrongdoing by the magistrates, and been prepared to suffer imprisonment for a time, he would not be party to illegal ownership arrangements at his chapel whatever the price. A number of his congregation would have been happy with this however, and put pressure on the remaining trustee to exceed his legal authority. Oughton's firm moral standards upset them; he again had to pay the price of unpopularity, just as when he had upset sections of the white population earlier. In the 1860s Oughton departed from religion and education slightly, though in his inimitable moralistic way. He wrote two books in which he tried to promote a theory, originally popular with some French and English thinkers in \\"The Enlightenment\\" period, that a population must 'want' artificial things to create drive and hard work, and therefore increasing wealth. In such a seductively warm and fertile island as Jamaica, Oughton contended, this might not happen; people might content themselves after reaching a certain standard of living. The Jamaican Baptists and emancipation The Baptist missions on Jamaica were closely involved in emancipation and reform. The mission was founded by the African George Lisle a former slave from America. Their churches on Jamaica promoted the slave Samuel Sharpe (1801‚Äì32) to Deacon at the Burchell Baptist Church in Montego Bay, and later the African Paul Bogle (1822‚Äì1865), believed to have been born free, to Deacon in Stony Gut, north of Morant Bay. There was progress, too in encouraging political and social involvement of women. Positions of responsibility such as \\"assistant class leader\\", \\"class leader\\", and above, were open to all who had the necessary reading and writing skills; men and women. One of the Baptist's cherished principles was of church self- government in which everyone was entitled to vote in elections and petitioning, which provided the first opportunity for many in the community to have their voice heard. This was one of the earliest routes through which the labouring poor began to have political influence. Progress was sometimes painfully slow, however, particularly for those who sought immediate self- government. At Samuel Oughton's chapel, Eleanor Vickars, an African assistant class-leader whose father is believed to have been a deacon, successfully stood for election as class-leader but did not meet the literacy requirement necessary for confirmation of her appointment. Samuel Oughton had to decide between the Baptist's cherished principles of self-government or upholding the literacy entry requirements arising from the hope that education would be \\"the great leveller\\". In the event, he avoided setting a precedent and called for both beliefs to be upheld equally, a route that did successfully lead to self- determination by African congregations. It has been noted that female literacy was strongly encouraged by the Baptist Missionary Society. In 1841 the Baptist Herald and Friend of Africa was able to report thirty-six female teachers and over 2,000 girls in day schools. Back in Britain a training school for female teachers was also established; at Kettering. Family Samuel's first wife was Hannah, a niece of Hester Burchell, who was the wife of Thomas Burchell. Samuel Oughton's second wife, Sarah (1819‚Äì1882), was sister of the wealthy British doctor and baptist, Nathaniel Rogers MD. Samuel Oughton died in London in December 1881 and is buried along with Sarah, each with a memorial plaque, in the Rogers' Family Mausoleum at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington. *A daughter, Lavinia Oughton, married Nonconformist author E.

At the 2016 census, the locality of Orroroo had a population of 610 while its urban centre had a population of 537. The Wilmington-Ucolta Road passes through here, intersecting with the RM Williams Way which leads to the Birdsville and Oodnadatta Tracks. The Peterborough‚ÄìQuorn railway line extended from Peterborough to Orroroo also in 1881 and Quorn in 1882, connecting with the new Central Australia Railway from Port Augusta. These railways have now been abandoned. Orroroo is situated near Goyder's Line, a line drawn up in 1865 by Surveyor General Goyder which he believed indicated the edge of the area suitable for agriculture. History Prior to European settlement, Orroroo was the home of the Ngadjuri Aboriginal people whose domain was the area to the east of the Flinders Rangers. The name Orroroo was thought to be an form of onomatopoeia in imitation of wind blowing through acacia trees. According to J. Gray, it actually meant 'early start', referring to the fact that the Ngadjuri, who usually camped at Pekina Creek, would move to camp at the Orroroo river the night before hunting for kangaroos, which would come up to the river at that point and thus allow them to make an early start at dawn for the hunt.* Aboriginal origins, but the true meaning of the word is uncertain. The name was first used by an early pioneer who conducted a nearby coaching house which served travellers on the Burra-Blinman track. In 1844, the first Europeans to settle, John and James Chambers, took up the Pekina Run which covered 320 square miles. They did not receive any rain during the 17 months that they lived there. As a result of this drought, they sold the Pekina Run for ¬£30. Charlie Easther settled in Orroroo during 1864 and opened up an eating house that became a popular stopping point for the drovers and bullockies who travelled through the area. The town was surveyed in 1875, when Solly's Hut, a clay-pugged log structure, was constructed as the town's first house and is now used as a museum. In September 1875, the town was officially named by George Goyder following the suggestion made by Charlie Easther . The first land sales were made in May 1876. The town was granted its own local council, the District Council of Orroroo, in 1887 (taking effect in 1888(, and the town's council offices were constructed in 1888. The District Council of Orroroo would survive until 1997, when it was merged to create the District Council of Orroroo Carrieton. On 24 August 1923, 230-volt electricity was connected to the town by Cr Martin Redden, Chairman of the District Council, in the presence of a large crowd. On 4 July 1962, the power house engines were shut down to change to AC power which gave the houses standard 240-volt power. Pekina Creek dam circa 1906 An early irrigation scheme was formed after damming the Pekina Creek and creating the Pekina reservoir. Water from here was supplied to over 50 dairy farms. Orroroo had its own flour mill, several bakeries, carriage manufacturer and a butter factory, which still stands. Orroroo is the service centre for a predominantly farming community with the main products being wheat, sheep, cattle, pigs and a kangaroo processor. A local curiosity is nearby, called \\"Magnetic Hill\\", which is a gravity hill optical illusion.Magnetic Hill - Peterborough - South Australia Railways The town was connected by the Peterborough‚ÄìQuorn railway line to Peterborough and Quorn in September 1881, and was served by a Class 1 station and a large Goods Shed. During 1962, concrete grain silos were built in the Yard. these provided the bulk of traffic until the railway was closed in 1987 Orroroo was the last attended station on the railway; staff were withdrawn and the station operated as \\"unattended\\" from August 1981. Passenger services were discontinued during 1969, when the South Australian Railways withdrew the railcar service. Grain continued to be hauled by rail from Orroroo until 1987, when all rail services were withdrawn by Australian National. Steamtown, a railway preservation group based at Peterborough, operated passenger trains for tourists to Orroroo and Eurelia until 2002. The railway line was eventually removed in 2008.Mills S \\"Harvest time for the Eurelia rail line\\" Flinders News - 19 September 2008 10 October 2008 Road transport Orroroo is on the south-north RM Williams Way (route B80) connecting Clare to Hawker and the west-east route B56 connecting the Port Augusta to Broken Hill. Origin of the name \\"Orroroo\\" \\"Orroroo\\" was officially named by a C.J. Easther, an early settler in the region. The Register of 16 November 1926 gives two still further alternatives, stating that Orroroo was the name of an Aboriginal girl who lived on nearby Pekina station, and that the town was for some reason named in honour of this girl, but also noting that others have suggested the name derivates from an Aboriginal word meaning 'dust', 'drift', or 'a windy locality'. It is true that in the Advertiser of 9 January 1903, it is said that orroroo means wind in \\"the native language\\".Advertiser, 9 January 1903 In the Advertiser of 15 August 1908, a still further derivation is suggested by a Gustav Degenhardt, who claims the name comes from the Aboriginal name for a nearby creek, Oorooroo.Advertiser, 15 August 1908 Degenhardt resided in Orroroo from at least as early as 1880 (five years after Easther named the town), so it may be that he had first-hand knowledge of Easther's reasons for so naming the town.South Australian Government Gazette, 12 February 1880 Orroroo Fire Service The Orroroo Country Fire Service (CFS) is the volunteer fire service of Orroroo.

Biography Bloy was born in Birchington, England as the son and grandson of Anglican priests. His family moved to the U.S. when he was age seven. He attended high school in Arizona and continued his studies at the University of Arizona before transferring to the University of Missouri. He hoped to become a diplomat and entered the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. However, he later decided to enter the clergy and enrolled in the Virginia Theological Seminary. In 1929, Bloy graduated from the seminary, married Frances Forbes Cox and became pastor of All Saints' Church in Reisterstown, Maryland where he served four years. At his ordination, he became the fifth generation of clergy in his family. In 1933, Bloy and his wife moved to La Jolla, California where he joined the staff of St. James Church. He became Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in Los Angeles in 1937 and held the post for 11 years until he was named bishop of Los Angeles. At the time of his consecration, the diocese had 70,000 members and when he retired, the membership had doubled and he had overseen the creation of 42 new churches and a diocesan budget that grown 400 percent. After the Watts Riots, the bishop helped provide funding for youth of the area to establish an auto repair shop. In 1958, he was instrumental in establishing an extension campus in Los Angeles of the Church Divinity School of the Pacific (CDSP) for students unable to study at the school's Berkeley campus. When CDSP was unable to continue funding the extension in 1962, Bloy had the Diocese assume control of the school and in 1970 merged it with the Claremont School of Theology. The resulting institution was renamed Bloy House and continues to provide training for Episcopal clergy. Bloy taught himself Sanskrit and became an authority on Eastern religions. He also enjoyed astronomy and fishing. In planning for his retirement, he and his wife purchased a home in the hills overlooking Pasadena so he could stargaze from his yard, however Mrs. Bloy died within two weeks of his retirement date. The Bloys had no children.

David Cronenberg appears in a cameo as a priest. Lambert co-wrote the story for the film with Brad Mirman, who also wrote the screenplay. The film was theatrically released in most of Europe, Asia and Australia, but went straight to DVD in the US. It was also occasionally aired/streamed on television.  Plot summary  Detective John Prudhomme, a Cajun transferred to Chicago, and his partner Hollinsworth are assigned to investigate the savage murder of a man whose left arm has been sawed off and taken. A message, \\"He Is Coming\\", is found written in lamb's blood on the victim's window. After another victim is discovered with a missing right arm, the detectives realize they are dealing with a serial killer. The third victim to be found has had his head removed. After studying the roman numerals found carved into the victims by the killer, Prudhomme realizes that when combined with the victims' names (Matthew and Peter and James), these numerals are citing Bible verses related to the resurrection of Jesus. Prudhomme theorizes that the killer plans to use the body parts he has taken to reconstruct the \\"Body of Christ\\" in time for Easter. This explains why each victim is 33 years old (Jesus was 33 at his death) and why the killer is ensuring that the victims are conscious when he kills them (Christ was conscious when he suffered). An FBI profiler named Wingate arrives and offers additional insights into the killer's mental state. Armed with this new information, Prudhomme and Hollinsworth are able to predict the killer's next target. When they interrupt the killing and give chase, Hollinsworth is tasered by the killer and dropped off a building, critically damaging his leg, which must be amputated. The amputated leg is later stolen by the killer. The killer leaves a message for Prudhomme, chiding him for interfering with the last killing and saying that for penance, Prudhomme's wife Sara must die. Prudhomme rushes home to find a mutilated corpse, but it is revealed to be Sara's visiting sister, and Sara herself is safe. With Hollinsworth hospitalized and unable to help him, Prudhomme turns to detectives Scholfield and Moltz, with whom he has had a contentious relationship, for help. The team finds a fifth victim in a slaughter house, missing his leg, meaning that the killer needs only a torso to complete his work. Scholfield discovers an FBI record of a similar murder several years earlier in Tennessee-- Prudhomme is irate that they did not get these FBI records from Wingate, who had promised to send all the FBI's information. When Prudhomme goes to the FBI's office, he finds Wingate, who is a different man than the apparent profiler his team has been working with. Knowing that the fake Wingate is the killer, Prudhomme and his team lay a trap and arrest the impostor for impersonating a police officer. The impostor's name is Demus, and he mocks the police because they cannot connect him to any murder. The judge for the case sets bond at only $20,000, which Demus pays. Although officers shadow the released Demus to the Chicago Union Station, in the restroom Demus escapes by changing clothes and crawling under the stalls. Prudhomme's team is able to connect Demus's fingerprints to the earlier murder in Tennessee, meaning they can now arrest him for murder if they find him. They discover that he had been in a mental institution for several years, only having been released two months ago. Meanwhile, Demus kills his sixth victim, taking the torso. Prudhomme theorizes that Demus may be hiding somewhere they already looked, and in the house of the first victim, they find the gruesome remains of his victims, arranged on a cross like a crucified Christ. Looking over Demus's notes and materials there, Prudhomme realizes that to complete his work, the killer plans to take the heart of a baby born from a woman named Mary on Easter, which is the following day. Moltz identifies a newly born baby from a Mary, and they rush to that hospital, where they find Demus with the baby. Moltz is wounded and Prudhomme chases Demus to the rooftop. He shoots Demus and catches the baby. Demus falls from the rooftop to his death. Some time later, Prudhomme visits a recovering Hollinsworth, who is learning to walk on a prosthetic leg and promises to return to the job better than ever.

According to director Russell Mulcahy's DVD commentary Resurrection was originally rated NC-17, which is why several scenes of violence and gore, like the leg cutting scene, were excised to achieve an R rating. The \\"Uncut version\\" of the film was never released and is presumed lost to this day.  Release  Resurrection was released in the fall of 1999 on cable television in the United States. In other countries such as France, Spain and Switzerland, it was shown in theatres. In France it was a modest success, with nearly 400,000 film admissions.

They are considered to be gods offering both protection and fertility and were placed outside of gates for protection against demons travelling between realities. Description Dol hareubangs are carved from porous basalt (volcanic rock) and can be up to three metres high. The statues' faces feature grinning expressions, bulging eyes without pupils, a long, broad nose, and slight smile, and their hands rest on their bellies, one slightly above the other. In sets of two, one has a higher left hand, and the other a higher right hand. The hat is commonly described as phallic or mushroom-like. Etymology The name dol hareubang derives from the Korean word for \\"stone\\" (dol Îèå), plus the Jeju dialect word hareubang (ÌïòÎ•¥Î∞©), meaning \\"grandfather\\" or \\"senior\\" (harabeoji [Ìï†ÏïÑÎ≤ÑÏßÄ] in Standard Korean), and was coined in the mid-20th century. Other earlier names for the statues include beoksumeori, museongmok, and useongmok. Beoksumeori, meaning shaman head, is used in the former area of Jeongui Hyeon (county), museongmok in Daejeong Hyeon and Jeongui Hyeon, and useongmok only in Jeju Hyeon. Historically, the Tamna Chronicles called them ongjungseok (ÏòπÏ§ëÏÑù/ÁøÅ‰ª≤Áü≥), but this usage is unknown today. History A dol hareubang in the National Museum of Korea in Seoul There are three main theories as to the origin of dol hareubangs: either that they were introduced by visitors from the sea, that they are a counterpart to the jangseungs (totem poles) of mainland Korea, or that they spread with shamanic mushroom culture. Jangseungs are also called beoksu in southern Korea, and this similarity with the name beoksumeori lends credence to the second theory. According to the Tamnaji a work dealing with the geography of Jejudo, the first dolhareubang was manufactured in 1754. Dol hareubangs produced from 1763 to 1765 once stood outside the eastern, western, and southern gates of the Jeju City fortress as guardian deities. In 2014, a Korea Aerospace University Professor Woo Sil-ha found a Chinese seokinsang (Áü≥‰∫∫ÂÉè, stone man statue) strikingly similar to dol hareubang in the Jianping Museum, Chaoyang, Liaoning, China. The seokinsang which is of Chinese Liao dynasty (907‚Äì1125) was discovered in December 2011 in Heishui, Jianping County, Liaoning, China. The Professor said that the origin of dol hareubang requires re-examination. Dol hareubangs today A dol hareubang at Hyeopjae Beach on Jeju Island Dol hareubangs have become the symbol of Jeju Island, and replicas of various sizes are sold as tourist souvenirs. The statues are sometimes sold as sources of fertility, and small replicas are sometimes given to women with fertility problems. The origin of this may have more to do with Jeju Do's present-day status as a \\"honeymoon island\\" than tradition.

An Irish immigrant widow woman of many titles, Margaret was also commonly referred to as the \\"Angel of the Delta,\\" ‚ÄúMother Margaret,\\" ‚ÄúMargaret of New Orleans,\\" the \\"Celebrated Margaret\\", \\"Head Mame\\", and \\"Margaret of Tully.\\" A Catholic, she worked closely with New Orleans Sisters of Charity, associated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans. She opened up four orphanages in the New Orleans area in the 19th century. Many years later in the 20th and 21st centuries, several of the asylums Margaret founded as places of shelter for orphans and widows evolved into homes for the elderly. A woman of great charity, Margaret became famed for her lifelong championing of the destitute. Some people considered her a living saint worthy of canonisation. Born into poverty and orphaned at a young age, she began her adult life as a washwoman and a peddler ‚Äì yet she died a businesswoman and philanthropist and received a state funeral. Statue commemorating \\"Margaret\\" in the Lower Garden District of New Orleans  Early life  A replica of the cottage in which Margaret Haughery (n√©e Gaffney) was born. Margaret was born in a stone cottage in Ireland in 1813, the fifth child of William and Margaret O'Rourke Gaffney.Jenkins, Regina Randolph. \\"Margaret Haughery.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 15 March 2020 Margaret's parents were from Tully South, in the parish of Carrigallen, County Leitrim. Her father had a small farm and was possibly a tailor. in Ireland, 1816 was called \\"the year without a summer\\" and 1817 \\"the year of the malty flour\\". The year 1818 was one of high emigration due to a succession of wet summers followed by extreme winters. William, his wife Margaret, and three of their six children ‚Äì including Margaret (then five), older brother Kevin and baby sister Kathleen ‚Äì left Ireland for the United States. The three eldest children were to remain temporarily with their uncle Matthew O'Rourke in Ireland, until such time as they could be sent for. The final parting was so distressing that friends drew the children staying in Ireland aside, and before the divided family left Ireland they knelt to receive the curate's blessing.Hackett, Raymond and Reilly, Michael. \\"Carrigallen Parish-A History\\", 1996  Emigration to America  The high seas journey by steamer took six months to reach America, as severe storms affected the ship's progress. Ship records reflect that the passengers despaired of ever reaching dry land again. At-sea provisions became so scarce that one passenger recalled that each person was allowed just one cracker a day. Almost all luggage was destroyed including the Gaffneys' trunk, whose lid Margaret's father then used to rock his young children. Eventually the ship reached Chesapeake Bay, then finally Baltimore. During the long voyage, a Welsh woman with the surname Richards became acquainted with the Gaffney family. Shortly after the Gaffney family disembarked in Baltimore, Maryland, baby Kathleen died. Like all small tenant farmers of his era, Margaret's father William was ill-equipped for city life. His job opportunities were limited. Nevertheless, he secured employment as a carter at the Baltimore docks and soon sent money to his brother-in-law O'Rourke for the upkeep of his three children remaining in Ireland. He had almost saved enough to send for them when in 1822 a yellow fever epidemic ravaged Baltimore, claiming Margaret's parents, William and Margaret, who died within days of each other. They are buried in St. Patrick's cemetery in Baltimore. All household effects were burned, as was the custom, to prevent spread of the infection, with the exception of a prayer book, which was found twenty-seven years later and returned to the family. Margaret, now nine, was homeless and soon alone as her older brother Kevin disappeared and was never heard from again. It is thought he may have gone out west. Mrs. Richards, who had made the overseas crossing with the Gaffney family heard of Margaret's plight. She had lost her husband to yellow fever. She took Margaret into her home. There Margaret remained for some years, where she worked for her keep. In fact she may have been little more than a servant. Margaret received no formal education, and never learned to read or write. When old enough, Margaret went into domestic service, which was common for Irishwomen in Baltimore at that time.  Marriage and move to New Orleans  On 10 October 1835, at age 21, Margaret married Irish-born Charles Haughery at a ceremony in Baltimore Cathedral. To escape the cold weather up north, Margaret persuaded him that a change in climate might be therapeutic for his poor health. They left Baltimore on the ship Hyperion and reached New Orleans on 20 November 1835. Like other New Orleanians of the time, the young family suffered from rampant epidemics of yellow fever and cholera. For a time Charles's health showed a slight improvement but it was short-lived and medical advice recommended a sea journey. Charles decided to go to Ireland, his native land. This trip was delayed by several months pending the birth of the couple's first child, a girl. They named her Frances. Eventually, Charles made the voyage but after some months Margaret received word that he died shortly after reaching his destination. Within a few months infant Frances became seriously ill and died. This was the second time that Margaret's family was wiped out, yet she was just 23 years of age. As she herself said, \\"My God! Thou hast broken every tie: Thou hast stripped me of all. Again I am all alone.‚Äù At that time, the city was divided into three municipalities: the first being the French Quarter and Faubourg Trem√©, the second being Uptown (then meaning all settled areas upriver from Canal Street) and the third being Downtown (the rest of the city from Esplanade Avenue on down river). Despite her tragedies, or because of them, Margaret was determined to do something in her life to help the plight of widows and orphans ‚Äî something she understood very well. The Sisters of Charity under the guidance of Sister Regis Barrett managed the Poydras Orphan Asylum (established by Julien de Lallande Poydras). Margaret would donate any extra money from her work at the laundry of the St Charles Hotel to the orphans. Eventually, she left her position at the hotel to work for the sisters as manager of the orphan asylum.\\"Margaret Haughery\\", The Historic New Orleans Collection When the orphans were without food she bought it for them from her earnings. The Female Orphan Asylum of the Sisters of Charity built in 1840 was financed from Margaret's work. Businesswoman During the yellow fever epidemic in New Orleans in the 1850s Margaret went about from house to house, without regard to race or creed, nursing the victims and consoling the dying mothers with the promise to look after their little ones. Eventually, She helped open the St. Theresa's Orphan Asylum on Camp Street. St. Theresa's Church was also practically built by Margaret, in conjunction with Sister Regis. With money Margaret saved from her wages, she purchased two cows to supply milk for the children. She bought a small milk cart and sold the fresh surplus milk in the Vieux Carr√© (French Quarter). Soon she started a dairy with nineteen cows. The dairy prospered and was expanded. Margaret increased her stock and began selling cream and butter. Within two years Margaret had a dairy herd of forty cows and a profitable business. She became known among all classes as a businesswoman who sold her produce through the community from her handcart. She also underwrote the St Vincent de Paul Infant Asylum at Race and Magazine, which opened in 1862. Although Margaret provided for the orphans, fed the poor, and gave generously to charity, her resources continued to grow. An industrious and resourceful woman determined to feed the orphans, at one point in time Margaret found employment at a bakery. Later on she loaned money to a baker but soon discovered that the business of Monsieur d' Aquin was on the verge of bankruptcy. She had become the main shareholder in the business. Margaret realised the only way she could recover her money was to take control of the bakery and operate it.Rogers, Rosemary. \\"The Mother of Orphans\\", Irish America, June/July 2016 Known simply as Margaret's Bakery, the bakery business quickly became a success, and it is from this that she made the greater part of her fortune. For years she continued her rounds with the bread cart, which replaced the milk cart. Margaret provided for the home market and her produce was exported. All the asylums in New Orleans were supplied with bread from her bakery at such a low price as to be virtually free. Improvements to the bakery were always a priority. It became the first steam bakery in the south, providing employment for many. The bakery situated in New Lev√©e Street was so successful that even the destruction so widespread in the South as a result of the Civil War had no effect on it. Although she provided for orphans, fed the poor, and gave enormously in charity, her resources grew dramatically and Margaret's thriving bakery became famous. Margaret Haughery & Company, was the first steam bakery in the South. The bakery sold \\"Margaret's Bread\\" and she became the \\"Bread Woman of New Orleans\\". Eventually, she owned a popular store in the city called the Klotz Cracker Factory, associated with the Klotz Bakery. The winos and beggars of the city used to converge on Lev√©e Street. Margaret would not turn them away by. She always gave them a loaf of bread but cut it in half so that they could not sell it to buy alcohol.  Civil War  The Civil War had a profound effect on New Orleans and greatly increased the number of orphans and people in need. Margaret made efforts to lessen the hardships by helping those who suffered from the wartime food shortage. To the hungry citizens of occupied New Orleans, Haughery gave wagonloads of bread and flour, fresh from her bakery. When, in 1862, the Union Army occupied New Orleans and put it under martial law in 1862, Commander, Union General Benjamin Franklin Butler, set up barriers and curfews. No one was to pass these barriers or be outside past the curfew. Margaret continued to distributed food and milk to the needy beyond the barriers. General Butler admonished her to stay behind the lines and that she would be shot or hung if she crossed them again. She asked the general if it was President Abraham Lincoln's will to starve the poor? General Butler replied, \\"You are not to go through the picket lines without my permission, is that clear?\\" \\"Quite clear,\\" answered Margaret. To which Butler responded, \\"You have my permission.\\" During Reconstruction, she supported the Union efforts to keep peace in Louisiana as evidenced by the ceremonial sword she donated to US General C. Colon Augur, and which is part of the Louisiana State Museum's collection.  Life in New Orleans  Photoportrait in her latter years After the Civil War, during the Reconstruction Period she earned enough to build the big steam factory for her bread. By this time everybody in the city knew her. The children all over the city loved her; the businessmen were proud of her; the poor people all came to her for advice. She used to sit at the open door of her office, in a calico gown and little shawl, and give a good word to everybody, rich or poor. Fashion-gowned women, bankers, tradesmen and merchants sought Margaret's counsel. Seated in the doorway of the bakery in the heart of the city, she became an integral part of its life, for, besides the poor who came to her continually, she was consulted by the people of all ranks about their business affairs, her wisdom having become proverbial. \\"Our Margaret\\" the people of New Orleans called her. The locals said she was masculine in energy and courage but gifted with the gentlest and kindest manners. When Irish-born Margaret first disembarked into Antebellum New Orleans during the cotton-boom era of commerce, she along with other waves of new Irish immigrants sought work and opportunity in Louisiana. The city of contrasts was dubbed the city of fever and fortune, a port of pestilence and prosperity. Moving away from wharf work, Irish immigrant male labourers took jobs that slaves were judged too valuable to do, such as canal ditch-diggers, levee-builders and rail-hands laying tracks through swampland. During construction of the city's New Basin Canal (shipping canal), the Irish accepted the hazardous and backbreaking work for a $1 a day wages. Although no official death-toll records were kept, an estimated 20,000 (+/-) workers perished during the project, most buried on the spot. Many widows and orphans were left. Poor and living in slums, the Irish were particularly susceptible to a series of epidemics that periodically swept the city. The Great Famine of Ireland peaked and those fleeing Ireland found cheap passage to port-city New Orleans. Irish immigrants were drawn to Louisiana's Catholic traditions, first established when France and Spain ruled the territory, prior to the Louisiana Purchase. By 1860, 14 percent of New Orleans' population was Irish. The city was home to the third-largest Irish population in the country. Irish women were a unique female immigrant group, vulnerable to ethnic and cultural stereotyping, as single women often travelled and lived together in groups, atypical to the pre-existing framework for Southern ladies. During Margaret's perilous and yet fruitful lifetime spent in New Orleans, mosquito-borne yellow fever epidemics remained a constant threat; during one three-year period alone, in 1853‚Äì55 the viral illness claimed 13,000. Margaret also braved and survived the 1856 Last Island Hurricane and the 1849 Mississippi River levee breach upriver from the city, the worst flooding the city had ever seen. The Sauv√©'s Crevasse flood left 12,000 homeless.  Orphanages built  Some of the New Orleans orphanages Margaret the \\"Mother of Orphans\\" built were St. Elizabeth Orphan Asylum on Napoleon Ave., the Louise Home on Clio Street for girls, St. Vincent Infant Asylum (at Race and Magazine Streets), and an asylum and church on Erato Street that became St. Theresa of Avila Church. She donated to the Protestant Episcopal Home as well and gave to Jewish charities in New Orleans. In her will she gave to the Seventh Street Protestant Orphan Asylum, the German Protestant Orphan Asylum, the German Orphan Catholic Asylum, the Widows and Orphans of Jews Asylum, and to the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, and many others. The Sisters of Charity withdrew from Poydras Street at the end of 1836 and moved to a new location in New Lev√©e Street, to what was considered a haunted house. It was vacant for many years and in a very poor state of repair. According to records, this was the first Catholic orphan asylum in New Orleans. It was Margaret's intention just to help the sisters get established. However, it was here that she found her true calling. She showed great energy and business acumen and was made manager of the institution. She confounded everybody by proving this location habitable, none more so than the landlord who promptly put the building up for sale. So, within two years, they were again seeking a home. Margaret knew of a house on a deserted plantation not far away and managed to persuade the owner to give it rent-free. She succeeded in fulfilling her ambition to get the children out of the city and into the Louisiana countryside. They were taught to read and write, but also to sew; they were given general preparation for entering the outside world. It was Margaret's great ambition to provide a permanent home for the orphans and in 1840 work on the St. Theresa's Asylum on Camp Street commenced. The site was donated by F. Saulet. Largely Margaret herself funded the project, but with help from a few others who gave donations as a result of her persuasion. Nevertheless, it took ten years to clear the debt and Margaret still supported the orphan asylum at the plantation at this time. Around the mid-19th century, yellow fever was again rampant. The yellow scourge swept New Orleans. The epidemic of 1853 rendered thousands of children homeless. Margaret visited the homes of the sick Protestants, Catholics and Jews, blacks and whites alike, the Louisiana Creole people, New Orleanian \\"Americans\\" and immigrants. Such were the numbers of orphans she encountered that she embarked on a new project in the form of (as she called it) a baby house. All her profits were channelled into this new endeavour, which soon took form in the shape of the imposing St. Vincent Infant Asylum at Race and Magazine streets, which opened in 1862. It took sixteen years to clear the debt, a burden shouldered mainly by Margaret. Other homes opened in the 1850s and 1860s included the Louise Home for working girls at 1404 Clio Street and the St. Elizabeth House of Industry at 1314 Napoleon Street. During the yellow fever epidemics in New Orleans, she visited the homes of the sick and dying, without regard to race or creed or religion, aiding the victims and consoling the dying mothers with the pledge to care for their children. It is estimated that the amount Margaret gave to charity in one form or another was in the region of $600,000.  Dress  Despite the vast sums at her disposal, philanthropist, businesswoman and social worker Margaret spent little on herself, and was reputed never to own more than two dresses ‚Äì a plain one for everyday use, while on special occasions she wore a plain silk dress and mantle. At all times she wore a Quaker bonnet, which became something of a trademark.  Illness and death  At the age of 69 Margaret contracted an incurable disease, the exact nature of which is not recorded. She lingered many months under the care of her friends, the Sisters of Charity. People of all classes and denominations visited her in this her last illness. The aristocratic of New Orleans knelt at her side. Pope Pius IX sent his blessing and a crucifix, which was presented to her by Father Hubert Thirion, Louisiana, a young French priest. Margaret died on 9 February 1882. Her body was taken to St. Vincent Infant Asylum, where it was embalmed and laid in state. The funeral took place on the following Saturday morning. Her death was announced in the newspapers with blocked columns as a public calamity, and the city newspapers were edged in black to mark her death. Her obituary was printed on the front page of The Times-Picayune newspaper, the main paper in the city.  State funeral  The funeral cortege assembled at the asylum included 13 priests, headed by Archbishop Napol√©on-Joseph Perch√© (third Archbishop of New Orleans). New Orleans Mayor Benjamin Flanders led the funeral procession and two Lieutenant Governors of Louisiana were pallbearers, George L. Walton and W.A. Robertson. Thousands, including prominent politicians, businessmen, and other members of the clergy, attended her funeral. Orphans from all the city's asylums were present, black and white, along with the historic Mississippi fire brigade (of which she was an honorary member) and nuns of numerous orders, as well as close friends and admirers. The streets, sidewalks, balconies, and windows were thronged with mourners. These included three generals, clergymen of all denominations, and city representatives. The cortege passed the New Orleans Stock Exchange at noon. Members suspended proceedings, left the room and came down to the sidewalk. St. Patrick's Church (New Orleans, Louisiana) was so thronged that the pallbearers had great difficulty getting the remains through the centre aisle. Requiem Mass was celebrated by Most Reverend Monsignor Allen with Archbishop Perch√© reading the prayers after Mass. Her friend Father Hubert gave the sermon. She was buried in the same Saint Louis Cemetery No. 2 tomb with her great friend Sister Francis Regis, the Sister of Charity who died in 1862 and with whom Margaret co-operated in all her early work for the poor. Margaret's will was filed for probate on the following Monday. In her will she left everything to charities, without distinction of religion, for widows, orphans, and the elderly. She left all her wealth to charities with the exception of the bakery, which she bequeathed to her foster son, Bernard Klotz. When Margaret died and her will was read, the people found that, with all her giving, she had still saved a great deal of money, and she left every cent of it to the different orphan asylums of the city; each one of them was given something. Whether the orphanages were for white children or black, for Jews, Catholics, or Protestants, made no difference; for Margaret always said, \\"They are all orphans alike.\\" Margaret's will was signed with a cross instead of a name as she never learned to read or write. Her signature was a poignant reminder of her humble beginnings, great business successes and mark on humanity, despite her inability to read or write.  Margaret Statue  \\"Margaret\\" Statue, New Orleans The people of New Orleans said, \\"She was a mother to the motherless; she was a friend to those who had no friends; she had wisdom greater than schools can teach; we will not let her memory go from us.\\" So the idea of erecting a public monument to Margaret in the city arose spontaneously. Almost immediately a committee was appointed to oversee the erection of a statue in Margaret's honour. A site was purchased between Camp, Prytania and Clio streets. Alexander Doyle, a young sculptor, was commissioned. The statue was fashioned from old photographs, first moulded in clay. This was sent to Italy where it was reproduced in Carrera marble. The statue was returned to New York from Italy after a time, but the commissioners of the monument declined to accept it, owing to imperfections in the marble. The sculptor at once procured another block and assured the commission that a perfect statue, according to model, would be shipped so as to reach New Orleans by May 1884. The monument was unveiled on 9 July 1884, two years after her death, by children from every orphanage in the city. Ex-Governor Francis T. Nicholls delivered a speech, and also present were the lady commissioners, the executive committee, New Orleans Mayor J. Valsin Guillotte, members of the city council and many others. The statue cost $6,000 which was donated in nickels and dimes ‚Äì \\"No large sums would be accepted.\\" The statue bears one word only, her name, Margaret. The statue of her was sculpted to resemble how she looked, sitting in her own office door, or driving in her own little cart. (Doyle was to carve other prominent monuments in New Orleans.) The little park in which Margaret's statue is erected is officially named Margaret Place. It has often been stated that this is the first public monument erected to a woman in the United States. It is the statue of a woman, sitting in a low chair or the era, with her arms around a child, who leans against her. Margaret wears thick shoes, a simple gingham dress, with her perennial shawl draped around her shoulders, and a bonnet; she is stout and short, and her face is a square-chinned Irish face; but her eyes look at you like your mother's. The small park is located where Camp and Prytania Streets meet in New Orleans. The poignant and beloved statue of a middle-aged woman seated in a chair with a small child nearby bears a plaque of one word: \\"Margaret.\\" At the time, Margaret's statue was thought to be the first monument to be erected in the United States in honour of a woman. As one leading New Orleans newspaper editorial put it, ‚ÄúShe was the most deservedly eminent, the most justly famous, of all the women of New Orleans, of our generation or of any other, in the whole history of the city.‚Äù Many still hail Margaret's sculpture as the first American statue of a notable woman. Officially, it is the second US monument to honour a woman, as the 1879 monument on Dustin Island in New Hampshire to Hannah Dustin (who in 1697 killed nine of her sleeping Indian captors and escaped) antedates Margaret's monument by five years, and was privately erected by her family on private property. However, Margaret's monument is the first publicly erected statue of a woman in the United States, the first monument to an American female philanthropist, and the only known statue to a baker.  Renewed interest in Margaret  An Ireland-based group called the \\"Margaret of New Orleans Tully Committee\\" is reconstructing Margaret's Irish birthplace cottage, using original stone. The group is dedicated to raising awareness about Margaret and her life's work. A full- length documentary film about Irish-born American heroine, Margaret, is currently in production, Who is Margaret Haughery? And why don't you know who she is? It will contain interviews with historians, including the author of the 1996 biography: Margaret: Friend of Orphans, Mary Lou Widmer. The documentary is introduced by former United States Ambassador to the Vatican, Corinne Claiborne \\"Lindy\\" Boggs. In 2009 the Leitrim Youth Theatre Company, Carrigallen, Ireland, mounted the first known live-theatre production of Margaret's life story. The stage performance \\"Our Story of Margaret of New Orleans\\" featured original music and songs. The Ogden Museum of Southern Art obtained a Jacques Amans original portrait of Margaret.  Other  Of the three older Gaffney family children left behind in Ireland (Thomas, Mary and Annie) when young Margaret and her parents, along with an infant and one brother, in 1819 set sail for America; for the rest of Margaret's life of tragedy and triumph ‚Äì of service and charity to others, orphans and windows in particular ‚Äì she only reunited with her remaining foreign-soil siblings once, when elder brother Thomas visited her in New Orleans in 1857. Although first entombed at St. Louis Cemetery No. 2 with Sister Regis, the Sisters of Charity communal tomb was later moved to a circa 1971 mausoleum vault at St. Louis Cemetery No. 3, located on Esplanade Avenue in New Orleans. Margaret along with her dear friend Sister Regis, and each Sister of Charity who died prior to 1914, are listed on two plaques; Margaret's St. Louis Mausoleum final resting place is an unmarked Vault numbered 18A, located on Mary Magdalene Corridor.Save Our Cemeteries, New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans, Louisiana Archbishop Perch√© in his 1882 eulogy to Margaret said, \\"I have already been asked whether Margaret Haughery, who lived and labored so long and well amongst us, was a saint. It is not for me to make a pronouncement. But, if you put this same question to yourselves, dear brethren, you may find an answer similar to that which a little boy once made when a sister in our Sunday school enquired that somebody define a saint. 'I think' said the child, remembering the human figures in stained glass windows, 'that a saint is one who lets the light shine through.'‚Äù References Sources *LSU, Louisiana Leaders, Notable Women in History, Margaret Haughery *Civil War Woman: Margaret Haughery *Strousse, Flora.

The park is surrounded by Moshannon State Forest. Parker Dam State park is north of Clearfield on Pennsylvania Route 153 just off exit 111 of Interstate 80. The park was constructed during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps. They built many of the facilities that are in use today at Parker Dam State Park. History The park takes its name from William Parker, who leased lumbering rights from John Otto. Parker built a splash dam on Laurel Run at the site of the present lake. Lumbering began as early as 1794 in Clearfield County, harvesting the white pine and hemlock which covered the mountainsides. The tall white pines fetched a high price in Baltimore for use as masts. Logs were floated all the way to Baltimore by way of the Susquehanna River. Logging picked up in force during the 1850s when the Susquehanna Boom was built across the West Branch Susquehanna River at Williamsport. The boom stopped the floating logs for sorting and cutting at the sawmills. Later, railroads and roads were built by the lumber companies to harvest and distribute the timber. The railroads replaced the floating of the logs down the creeks and into the West Branch. The lumber boom era was not to last, and soon all the trees were gone. Once the trees disappeared, the people were soon to follow. The lumbermen left behind a barren landscape that was devastated by erosion, flooding and wildfires for twenty years. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought the thousands of acres of deforested and burned land. The state began the massive project of reforesting the land. The young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps led the reforestation effort. They also built miles of road, many bridges, cleared streams and built the facilities at Parker Dam State Park. Ecology Tannin-dyed wetlands from the Beaver Dam Trail Parker Dam State Park and the surrounding Moshannon State Forest provides a habitat for a wide variety of wild creatures. There are many warblers and ravens to be seen in the dark coniferous forests. The rarely seen ovenbird and American redstart make their home in the deciduous forest. Turkey, beaver, white-tailed deer, coyotes and foxes can be spotted along the ridges, in the hollows and in the fields of the park. Bobcat, porcupine and elk also make their home in the woods of Parker Dam State Park. Elk are rarely seen in Pennsylvania, but there is a large herd that has thrived in the most remote and wooded parts of Clearfield, Cameron, Elk and Clinton counties. 1985 Tornado Animation of GOES 6 satellite taken May 31st, 1985. The Parker Dam tornado occurred out ahead of the main line that day. The storm can be seen forming around the northern tip of the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia and moving eastward across Pennsylvania. A tornado struck Clearfield County during the 1985 Barrie tornado outbreak that occurred on May 31 of that year and destroyed a great portion of the forest in Parker Dam State Park. The tornado was rated F4 on the Fujita scale with winds in the park of up to 260 M.P.H. At the time of the tornado, not many people were in the park, although a couple of campers and boy scouts were on hand to tell the story of survival. This tornado escaped the news, due to no loss of life and its location. It was the longest-lived tornado of the outbreak that day in the state, staying on the ground for 69 miles, and stretching across the counties of Clearfield, Clinton, and Centre, and was one of four F4 tornadoes to touch down in Pennsylvania that day. The state used this as an opportunity to teach about how forests will regrow if left untouched after a tornado. Mud Run Road dissects the tornado damaged area.

Brown (1873), a case decided by the United States Supreme Court. She was African-American. Career Brown was a US Senate employee \\"in charge of the ladies' retiring room\\". Historical significance On February 8, 1868, Brown boarded a train to travel from Alexandria, Virginia to Washington, D.C. She entered \\"what they call the 'white people's car.'\\" As she was boarding, a railroad policeman told her to move to a different car. He told her the car she had entered \\"was for ladies,\\" and \\"no damned n----- was allowed to ride in that car; never was and never would be.\\" She replied, \\"This car will do.\\" The railroad police officer and another employee grabbed Brown and, after a violent struggle that lasted six minutes, in which she was beaten and kicked, threw her on the boarding platform, dragged her along the platform and threatened to arrest her. She asked, \\"What are you going to arrest me for? What have I done? Have I committed robbery? Have I murdered anybody?\\" Brown's injuries were so severe that she was bedridden for several weeks and spit up blood. Senators Charles Sumner and Justin Morrill called for a formal investigation, and Senator Charles Drake agreed. A resolution was passed on February 10, and Senate committee heard testimony later that month. Brown sued the railway company for damages and was awarded $1,500 in damages in the district court. The railway company appealed, and the case eventually went before the US Supreme Court. On November 17, 1873, in an opinion delivered by Justice David Davis, the Court held that racial segregation on the railroad line was not allowed under its Congressional charter, which stated \\"no person shall be excluded from the cars on account of race.\\" Davis dismissed the company's \\" separate but equal\\" argument as \\"an ingenious attempt to evade a compliance with the obvious meaning of the requirement\\" of the 1863 charter and decided in favor of Brown.Railroad Company v. Brown, 84 U.S. 445 (1873); US Supreme Court Case, Justia.com The Court held that white and black passengers must be treated with equality in the use of the railroad's cars: Brown recovered from her injuries and remained a Senate employee until 1881.

Jangseungs were traditionally placed at the edges of villages to mark for village boundaries and frighten away demons. They were also worshipped as village tutelary deities. In the southern regions of Jeolla, Chungcheong, and Gyeongsang, jangseungs are also referred to as beopsu or beoksu, a variation of boksa (Î≥µÏÇ¨/ÂçúÂ∏´), meaning a male shaman. In the Jeolla region, jangseungs are often made of stone bearing some resemblance to the dolhareubangs of Jeju Island. The passing of Korea (1906) by the American Protestant missionary Homer Bezaleel Hulbert. In Seoul, 18th century Joseon Dynasty King Jeongjo ordered jangseungs erected in the area near Sangdo to ward off evil spirits when he made a royal procession to Suwon, where his father's tomb was located. Since then, the district has been called Jangseungbaegi and has given its name to the Jangseungbaegi Station on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway's Line 7. Jangseungs are usually adorned with inscriptions describing the personae of the carved figures along the front of the poles. \\"Male\\" jangseungs usually bear inscriptions in Hangul or Hanja reading \\"Great General of All Under Heaven,\\" or Cheonha-daejanggun (Hangul: Ï≤úÌïòÎåÄÏû•Íµ∞, Hanja: Â§©‰∏ãÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç) and are decorated with headpieces resembling those worn by Korean aristocrats or scholars. \\"Female\\" jangseungs, on the other hand, wear less elaborate headpieces and usually bear inscriptions reading \\"Female General of the Underworld,\\" or Jiha- yeojanggun (Hangul: ÏßÄÌïòÏó¨Ïû•Íµ∞, Hanja: Âú∞‰∏ãÂ•≥Â∞áËªç) or \\"Great General of the Underworld,\\" or Jiha-daejanggun (Hangul: ÏßÄÌïòÎåÄÏû•Íµ∞, Hanja: Âú∞‰∏ãÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç).  Place  Depending on the location or affiliation, Jangseung can be divided into village guardian, temple guardian, and public guardian. The village guardian is the god of dongje, and has the functions of village guardian, mural, expelling the harmful ghosts, fire prevention, and gathering happiness for the village. The temple guardian post has the function of protecting the temple from the invisible evil spirits. The temple guardian is the boundary mark of the temple. The public guardian is a milestone and a street god to protect the safety of the gate, barracks, and roads and sea roads.

Bly made his argument by comparing examples of verse by European and South American poets and some medieval Arabic poems (which he likes) with Modernist and contemporary American examples (which he dislikes). He criticized most American poetry from 1917-1963, beginning with the generation of Modernist poets that included T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D. and Marianne Moore; then he also vehemently attacked the postwar generation of American poets, specifically citing Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, Randall Jarrell, John Ciardi, Charles Olson, Karl Shapiro, John Berryman, and Delmore Schwartz, all of whom he claimed were negatively influenced by the previous generation. The only American poets from these groups whom he exempted from his critique were Hart Crane and Theodore Roethke. Bly criticized Eliot's idea of the objective correlative as emblematic of everything wrong with the Modernist approach to poetry. He wrote that these poets \\"have more trust in the objective, outer world than in the inner world\\" and that this made their poetry essentially soulless. He contrasted the Modernists' \\"scientific\\" approach with the poetry and ideas of European poets like Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and Rainer Maria Rilke. Bly believed that \\"Eliot and Pound conceive maturity [in a poet] as a growth of outwardness\\" which Bly believes is dehumanizing. In sharp contrast, he noted that Rainer Maria Rilke advised that a poet should focus on their inner lives and always strive to \\"go into yourself,\\" and this was the aesthetic path that Bly insisted was the only path that poets could take in order to write worthwhile poetry. Some of the great, European and South American poets who Bly believed followed this path in their writing and were the models that American poets should be imitating (instead of the Modernists) included Pablo Neruda, St√©phane Mallarm√©, C√©sar Vallejo, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Antonio Machado, Lorca, and Rilke. Some of the scholarly and stylistic approaches to poetry that he criticized over the course of his essay included The New Criticism, the Metaphysical Poets, Imagism, and Objectivism, all of which he viewed as superficial, overly outward looking, and materialistic.

The Pudding Shop is the nickname for the Lale Restaurant in Sultanahmet, Istanbul, Turkey. It became popular in the 1960s as a meeting place for beatniks and, later on, hippies and other travellers on overland route between Europe and India, Nepal, and elsewhere in Asia: the \\"hippie trail\\". The restaurant got its colloquial name as a result of \\"word of mouth\\" from numerous foreign travellers that could not remember the name of the restaurant but did remember the wide and popular selection of puddings sold there and thus referred to it as the \\"pudding shop\\".Hewton, Terry. \\"Pining for past pudding in Istanbul\\" The Advertiser 18 March 1998:1-3. Retrieved via Lexis Nexis, 23 January 2008. Background Brothers ƒ∞dris and Namƒ±k √áolpan opened the restaurant in 1957. Later, most of its customers were tourists, the Pudding Shop eventually developed into a popular rest stop, a place where people could gather, discuss their travelling experiences, and delight in fairly priced, traditional Turkish food. Among the restaurant's variety of well-known dishes and desserts was tavuk g√∂ƒüs√º, a seldom found pudding made from pounded chicken breast, rice flour, milk, sugar topped with cinnamon.Leigh, Rowley. \\"Food and drink and silver and spice and all things nice\\" The Guardian (London) 16 November 1996: 52. Retrieved via Lexis Nexis, 23 January 2008. The restaurant still offers this dish, catering to customers with appetites for traditional Turkish cuisine. During the 1960s, customers could enjoy their meals inside, where there were large booths and couches surrounded by piles of books and the audible music of contemporary rock bands playing lightly in the background. Decoration was minimal; on the plain white walls hung occasional prints of paintings and photographs without a real theme. Towards the left side of the restaurant's interior, the entire wall was composed of glass, creating a greater sense of space for the small location. The lack of decor did not in any way make the restaurant appear meek or glum. The garden was another area to relax and eat with the grand view of the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia in the distance. Here many customers played their instruments, sang, and conversed about their travels in the fresh air. Adem √áolpan, son of ƒ∞dris √áolpan, remembers how \\"it was the time of the Vietnam War\\" and how many of the travellers just \\"lived for the moment‚Ä¶ didn't think much of tomorrow.\\" In its first few years, the Pudding Shop was the only place in the area where direct transportation to Asia and tourist information on Turkey were readily available. With this knowledge, the √áolpan brothers put up a bulletin board inside the restaurant so that travellers could schedule rides with their fellow travellers and communicate with friends and family members. This board was very useful to the tourists, and eventually became notorious for the variety of personal messages that were posted alongside the transportation notifications. These included love and apology letters; one of the board's most well-known posts was an open love letter from \\"Megan\\" to \\"Malcolm\\" in which she asked for his forgiveness and apologised for \\"the business down in Greece.\\"Milton, Giles. \\"The pudding that just fell to earth\\" Evening Standard (London) 3 May 1995:27. Retrieved via Lexis Nexis, 23 January 2008. A few other messages from the 1960s travellers are still posted on the board today serving as nostalgic homages to its past. Outside the restaurant, there is now a large sign that says \\"The World Famous Pudding Shop\\" and inside there are no longer servers but a self-service cafeteria and a large menu illuminated by neon lights. Today The old bulletin board still hangs but is no longer flooded by messages between family members, friends, and lovers. Today, it is covered instead, with less romantic and more practical messages between travellers. The garden where travellers once congregated for meals, or after meals to play their instruments has been removed. Some individuals believe that the major change that the restaurant has undergone since its hippie hey-days is due to the fame that it has acquired. In 1978, the Pudding Shop was featured in the popular book and film Midnight Express, which contributed to the growing reputation of the restaurant.

The Allgemeiner Deutscher Nachrichtendienst (ADN), German for General German News Service, was the state news agency in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). It supplied news content to GDR newspapers and news broadcasters.  History  The ADN was established in October 1946 as a GmbH (limited liability company) with the support of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. In 1953, the GDR's ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) ordered ADN GmbH dissolved and converted into a government agency with a monopoly on national and international news coverage. Although the ADN was officially subordinate to the Council of Ministers, the SED maintained a careful watch over it as the most important means of disseminating news to the public. In 1956, ADN assumed control over formerly independent photographic agencies in Berlin under the name ADN Zentralbild (ADN-ZB ‚Äì German: Central Picture). According to the ADN statute of 1966, its task was to report news in light of the ruling party's program, resolutions of the party's Central Committee and regulations issued by the GDR Council of State and Council of Ministers. Until the end of the 1970s, ADN compiled and distributed news via teleprinters. The ADN began converting to electronic text processing and transmission in 1979, using technology purchased from the Kyoto-based Omron Corporation. Up to 1989, ADN employed approximately 1,400 people. It did not survive for long after German reunification in 1990. In May 1992, reduced to a staff of 254 and unable to compete with West German news services, the firm was sold to the Deutsche Depeschendienst (German Telegraphic Service). The collection of approximately one million historical photos preserved by ADN Zentralbild, some dating back to the earliest years of photography, were acquired by the German Federal Archives in Koblenz.  Coverage  The ADN exercised a monopoly over the wire-service business in the GDR, supplying news dispatches, reports, articles and photographs to nearly all newspapers and radio and television broadcasters in the GDR. While newspapers and other periodicals also maintained their own staffs of reporters and editors, ADN set the overall standards for media in the GDR. Coverage was divided into two categories, Inland (domestic) and Ausland (foreign). Ausland coverage included the political and economic situations in other countries, including the Federal Republic of Germany. All other areas, including politics, the economy. culture, education, science and sports, were considered Inland. There was a separate reporting service for news related to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the economic community of socialist states. ADN maintained domestic bureaus in each of the GDR's fifteen governmental districts, or Bezirke, including East Berlin, as well as a network of foreign offices in socialist and capitalist states. The ADN's foreign correspondents not only covered international news but also supplied the GDR government with confidential reports and news analysis from the countries to which they were assigned.

It is found naturally in Europe and Siberia, and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. While especially associated with birch, it is also found with spruce, pine and other trees in mixed woodland. The messy, dirty appearance, seen in the photograph, is characteristic of the species and gives it its English name and the Latin species epithet, turpis. It seems to collect debris on top and the gills acquire a dirty brownish stain due to discoloured milk. Taxonomy and naming This very variable mushroom demonstrates a common phenomenon in mycology as there is much disagreement over naming. The three main scientific designations: *Lactarius turpis Fr., *Lactarius necator (Bull.:Fr.) Karsten, and *Lactarius plumbeus (Bull.:Fr.) S. F. Gray, are usually, but not always, considered to be synonyms for same species. The epithets necator and plumbeus were both coined by Pierre Bulliard as Agaricus necator (1791) and Agaricus plumbeus (1793), but there is and was confusion as to which mushrooms were meant. The name turpis, derived from the Latin term turpis \\"ugly\\", was originated by Johann Anton Weinmann and taken over by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. Plumbeus too referred to the milk-cap's appearance, derived from the Latin for plumbeus \\"lead-coloured\\". Description L. turpis Marcel Bon: \\"The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North-Western Europe\\" Hodder & Stoughton ., also available in English. The cap is normally in diameter. At first it has an involute margin and a somewhat depressed centre. The upper surface is olive brown or yellow-green and is often sticky or slimy in the middle. When young it has velvety zones and may be shaggy at the rim. Later it becomes funnel-shaped and the colour darkens to blackish. The gills are dirty white, stained olive-brown by old milk, which is initially white on contact with the air. They are somewhat decurrent. With potassium hydroxide or ammonia there is a purple reaction. The stipe is up to about tall by in diameter and it is similar in colour to the cap, but much lighter. It may have shallow pits (scrobiculae). The flesh is a dirty white and tends to turn brown. The taste (especially the milk) is acrid. There is little smell. The spores are about 7x6 ¬µ and are ornamented with a pattern of ridges. Edibility This species is reported to contain the mutagen necatorin (=7-hydroxycoumaro(5,6-c)cinnoline), and so it cannot be recommended for eating. Boiling reduces the concentration of this compound, but does not effectively eliminate it. Probably due to the acrid taste, most western European authorities classify this mushroom as inedible or poor. However, it has popularly been used (after boiling) as a spice in mushroom dishes in northern and eastern Europe and Siberia (see Mushroom picking in Slavic culture). It is commercially available preserved in salt.See site of YeniseyEcoproduct, Krasnoyarsk Considered a choice mushroom in Russia, one of the best for pickling (salt only, no vinegar).

The collision had no survivors. Aircraft and crews The TWA plane, flown by Captain J. W. Quinn and co-pilot Robert K. Childress, with air hostess (flight attendant) Patricia Ann Stermer, was a regularly scheduled flight bound for Dayton, Ohio, en route to Cleveland. Ten passengers were aboard.Lebanon Daily News, Monday, January 12, 1955The Holland Evening Sentinel, Monday, January 12, 1955 The DC-3 was piloted by Arthur \\"Slim\\" Werkhaven of Sturgis, Michigan, with co-pilot Edward Agner of Battle Creek, Michigan, and was being flown from Battle Creek en route to Lexington, Kentucky. They were to pick up Mr. and Mrs. Fredrick Van Lennep. Mrs. Van Lennep, the former Frances Dodge, was an officer of the firm that owned the plane and founded the Dodge Stables at Meadow Brook Farm, later moving Dodge Stables to Castleton Farm in Lexington. The plane would have carried the Van Lenneps to Delray Beach, Florida.

The right wing of the Martin 2-0-2 struck the left wing of the DC-3, which caused the right wing of the Martin to separate and the DC-3 experienced fuselage, rudder, and fin damage. Following the collision, both aircraft crashed out of control, hitting the ground about two miles apart. The wreckage of one of the aircraft fell along Hebron-Limaburg Road, two miles northeast of Burlington, Kentucky. The crash had no survivors from either aircraft. Aftermath The control tower, operated by the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA), reported that it had no record of a flight plan for either aircraft. A CAA spokesman said that radio messages from the TWA plane shortly after takeoff indicated the pilot was \\"alarmed and excited\\".The Middletown Journal, January 12, 1955 The spokesman also said the pilot was cleared for takeoff and to make a right turn out. TWA later filed a $2 million damage suit against the Castleton Corporation of Kentucky.Aviation Daily, American Aviation Publications, 1955 The probable cause was determined to be operating the DC-3 in a controlled zone with unknown traffic, i.e. no clearance received and no communication with the airport tower.CAA Report See also * Aviation safety * List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft References External links *Cincinnati / Northern Kentucky International Airport *AirDisaster.com Accident Database 1955 TWA Martin 2-0-2 crash Category:1955 in Kentucky Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Kentucky Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Kentucky Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1955 Category:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport Category:Mid-air collisions Category:Trans World Airlines accidents and incidents Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Douglas DC-3 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Martin 2-0-2 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving mid-air collisions Category:January 1955 events ","title":"1955 Cincinnati mid-air collision"},{"id":"8003459","text":"Los Danzantes de Levanto is a typical dance from the Amazonas Region, Peru.

Playing career Rowlands was born in Brithdir, Bridgend, the son of a Glamorgan Constabulary Police Inspector. After attending Cowbridge Grammar School, on his father's transfer to Aberdare, Rowlands entered the second year at Aberdare Boys' Grammar School and went on to captain both the rugby (1953‚Äì54) and cricket teams (1954 and 1955). He won a Welsh Secondary School Cap in 1955, playing against England at Cardiff. He graduated from University of London and served National Service with the 1st Battalion of The Welch Regiment from 1958 to 1960. Rowlands played for Aberaman and then London Welsh.http://www.aberdareonline.co.uk/content/public/history/sporting%5Fgreats/the%5Fvalleys%5Fgreat%5Fsportsmen/ He transferred to Llanelli for one season in 1958, before Cardiff signed him in September 1961. He played 147 games for the Welsh capital side until 1967. In March 1962 he gained his first of five caps for Wales when he played in the winning side which beat France. He made his debut for the Barbarians at Leicester in March 1962, later captaining the side in 1966. Rowlands represented the British and Irish Lions on 19 occasions, including all three tests in the 1962 Tour of South Africa, where he scored a try in the final international. He also played in the non-cap Lions match with Kenya. He played his last rugby for Newport RFC in 1973/74. Post playing Rowlands finished playing in 1967, and immediately became a committee member at Cardiff RFC. He was chairman for the 1974 season and continued to serve Cardiff until 1986. Whilst serving on the Cardiff committee, he became a member of the Welsh Rugby Union. Rowlands was appointed as one of the WRU's two representatives on the International Rugby Board in 1983 and became the IRB's first general secretary in 1988. Under Rowlands guidance, its headquarters moved from Bristol to Dublin, Ireland. This was key in turning the Rugby World Cup into one of the leading sporting events in the world, which Rowlands was at the heart of as one of its directors. Rowlands decided to retire at the end of the 1995 Rugby World Cup. However, IRB chairman Vernon Pugh and the RWC chairman Leo Williams persuaded Rowlands to take on the Chief Executive's role at the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. He resigned all positions with the IRB and the RWC after the tournament ended. In 2004 Rowlands beat WRU Secretary David East in the contest to succeed Sir Tasker Watkins as Welsh Rugby Union president.BBC SPORT  Rugby Union  Welsh  WRU appoint new president Outside rugby Rowlands was married to Jean, with whom he had one child named Joanne. In his retired years, he lived with his wife in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. As he played his rugby in amateur days, Rowlands worked in sales and marketing for Arthur Guinness Ltd and the Taunton Cider before becoming a full-time professional at the IRB. In his retirement Rowlands had roles as Patron of Aberaman RFC, President of Rhiwbina RFC, the Welsh Academicals and the Welsh Deaf Rugby Association.

A common and widely distributed species, it is found in North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and North America. It was first described scientifically by Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer in 1774 as an Agaricus, and later transferred to the genus Lactarius in 1821 by Samuel Frederick Gray. A variety, L. torminosus var. nordmanensis, is known from the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. L. torminosus officially became the type species of Lactarius in 2011 after molecular studies prompted the taxonomic reshuffling of species between several Russulaceae genera. A mycorrhizal species, L. torminosus associates with various trees, most commonly birch, and its fruit bodies (mushrooms) grow on the ground singly or in groups in mixed forests. The caps of L. torminosus mushrooms are convex with a central depression, and attain a diameter of up to . A blend of pink and ochre hues, the cap sometimes has concentric zones of alternating lighter and darker shades. The edge of the cap is rolled inward, and shaggy when young. On the underside of the cap are narrow flesh-colored gills that are crowded closely together. The cylindrical stem is a pale flesh color with a delicately downy surface and brittle flesh; it is up to long and thick. When cut or injured, the fruit bodies ooze a bitter white latex that does not change color upon exposure to air. The variety nordmanensis, in contrast, has latex that changes from white to yellow. Lactarius torminosus can be distinguished from similar species like L. pubescens or L. villosus by differences in morphology and coloration, or by microscopic characteristics like spore shape and size. Although it is valued for its peppery flavor and eaten after suitable preparation in Russia and Finland, the species is highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including ergosterol and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral. Taxonomy and phylogeny German naturalist Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer was the first to describe the species, placing it in the genus Agaricus in 1774. Seven years later in 1781, Jean Bulliard described a species he called Agaricus necator and illustrated it in the first volume of his Herbier de la France; this name and the synonym Lactarius necator, resulting from Christian Hendrik Persoon's 1800 transfer to Lactarius, are both considered to refer to L. torminosus. Otto Kuntze, for his part chose to put it in Lactifluus, while Paul Kummer thought Galorrheus was the appropriate placement; until the recent resurrection of Lactifluus, both genera had been long considered to be unnecessary segregates of Lactarius. According to Index Fungorum, another synonym is Samuel Frederick Gray's Lactarius necans. Gray also gave the species its modern name when he transferred it to Lactarius in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British Plants. The specific epithet torminosus means \\"tormenting\\" or \\"causing colic\\", in reference to the gastrointestinal distress associated with consuming the raw mushroom. Early English vernacular names were Gray's \\"bellyach milk-stool\\" (1821), and James Edward Smith's \\"bearded pepper agaric\\" (1824). More recent common names include \\"shaggy milkcap\\", \\"powderpuff milkcap\\", \\"pink-fringed milkcap\\", \\"bearded milkcap\\", and the British Mycological Society-recommended \\"woolly milkcap\\". According to Hesler and Smith's 1979 classification of the genus Lactarius, L. torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), subsection Piperites. Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow.Hesler and Smith (1979), p. 237. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L. torminosus falls into a group that includes L. torminosulus, and that these two species are closely related to a group that includes L. tesquorum, L. scoticus, and L. pubescens. A multi-gene molecular analysis published in 2008 demonstrated that species then distributed in the genera Lactarius and Russula actually consisted of four distinct lineages. The subsequent reorganization of Russulaceae species‚Äîa taxonomic change needed to make Russula and Lactarius monophyletic‚Äîrequired that a new type species be defined for Lactarius, since the previous type, L. piperatus, belonged to the clade that will be transferred to genus Lactifluus. A proposal to conserve Lactarius with L. torminosus as the type was accepted by the Nomenclatural Committee for Fungi and passed at the 2011 International Botanical Congress. The change minimizes \\"taxonomic disruption\\", allowing most of the common and well-known Lactarius species to retain their names. Description Young fruit body showing the tomentose cap margin and forked gills The cap is initially convex, but as it matures the center forms a depression and the outer edges rise until it assumes the shape of a shallow funnel; its final width is typically between . The cap margin is strongly curled inward; when young, it is tomentose (covered with a thick matting of hairs), forming a veil-like structure that partly covers up the gills. This tomentum diminishes with age. The cap surface is at first similarly tomentose, but eventually, the hairs wear off, leaving the surface more or less smooth. The surface starts off somewhat sticky with clear concentric rings of darker shade (a zonate pattern); these rings, especially the outer ones, usually fade in maturity. The cap color is pinkish- orange to pale dull pink, becoming orange to whitish toward the margin as the pink gradually fades. The white to flesh-colored flesh is firm and brittle, but becomes flaccid in age. The latex that is produced when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured is white to cream, and does not change color with prolonged exposure to air, nor does it stain the gills. It has an acrid taste, with a slight to pungent odor. The gills are subdecurrent (running only a small way down the length of the stem), close to crowded together, narrow, and sometimes forked near the stem. Their color is whitish, becoming pink-tinged, turning pale tan with age. The adult stem is long, thick, fragile, more or less equal in width throughout, and cylindrical or narrowed at the base. Its surface is dry, and either smooth to pruinose (covered with a very fine whitish powder on the surface). The color ranges from pale light pink to yellowish-tinged or slightly pinkish-orange to orange-white, sometimes spotted. The interior of the stem is firm, beige white, and filled with a soft pith, but it eventually becomes hollow. Occasionally, white mycelium is visible at the base of the stem where it meets the ground.Bessette et al. (2009), pp. 257‚Äì58. The fruit body formation of L. torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In this type of development, the hymenium forms early on the underside of the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow. =Microscopic characteristics= The spore print of L. torminosus is cream to pale yellow, and the spores 8‚Äì10.2 by 5.8‚Äì6.6 Œºm, roughly spherical to broadly elliptical in side view, and hyaline (translucent). Only the ornamentation on their surface is amyloid; it is partially reticulate (network-like) with interrupted ridges roughly 0.5‚Äì0.7 Œºm high, and a few isolated warts. Spores have a conspicuous apiculus, demarcating where it was once attached to the basidia via the sterigma. The basidia are four-spored, hyaline and club-shaped to cylindrical, measuring 30‚Äì47.7 by 7.3‚Äì8.2 Œºm. Pleurocystidia are present only in the form of macrocystidia embedded and originating in the hymenium and just below it, they reach 40.3‚Äì80.0 by 5.1‚Äì9.5 Œºm. Macrocystidia are abundant in the hymenium. Characterized by their spindle-shaped to ventricose (swollen on one side) form that gradually tapers in width, they have granular hyaline contents. Gill edge cystidia (cheilocystidia) are smaller: 30‚Äì52 by 4.5‚Äì8.0 Œºm. The cap cuticle is made of gelatinized, interwoven hyphae arranged more or less parallel to the cap surface (a form known as ixocutis); the thin-walled, threadlike hyphae of this layer are 2.5‚Äì7.3 Œºm wide. =Variety nordmanensis= Lactarius nordmanensis was described by Alexander Smith in 1960 to account for a North American species closely resembling L. torminosus in appearance, but with a slightly larger range of spore sizes (9‚Äì11 by 6.5‚Äì8 Œºm). In contrast to the unchanging latex of L. torminosus, L. nordmanensis has whitish latex that slowly changes to pale yellow upon exposure to air; the latex also stains mushroom tissues and paper yellow. Hesler and Smith reduced L. nordmanensis to the status of a variety under L. torminosus in 1979. Lactarius torminosus var. nordmanensis has been recorded from California, Idaho, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the United States, Quebec in Canada, and Switzerland. The variety resembles Lactarius pubescens var. betulae, but differs in its longer pleurocystidia, larger spores with slightly different spore ornamentation, and strongly burning acrid taste.Hesler and Smith (1979), pp. 277‚Äì78. The holotype specimen of L. torminosus var. nordmanensis was collected by Smith in 1956 near Nordman, Idaho. =Similar species= The woolly cap margin, pinkish tones in the cap, acrid latex, and association with birch are reliable field characteristics to help identify L. torminosus. However, there are several hairy Lactarius species with which it is often confused, and sometimes examination of microscopic characteristics is necessary to distinguish between them. The closely related L. torminosulus is a dwarf version of L. torminosus, an arctic species associated with the birches Betula nana or B. glandulosa. Immature fruit bodies of L. scrobiculatus resemble L. torminosus, but they have a white latex that soon turns yellow upon exposure to air, and their stems have shiny depressed spots. The caps of the poorly known species L. cilicioides are not zonate, and its spores are smaller. L. pubescens is physically quite similar, but can be distinguished by its paler color and smaller spores (6.0‚Äì7.5 by 5.0‚Äì6.5 Œºm). L. controversus has a cap margin that is not as hairy, whitish to cream-colored gills, and larger spores measuring 7.5‚Äì10 by 6‚Äì7.5 Œºm. L. mairei has a coloration similar to L. torminosus, but is rarer and typically found associated with oak trees on calcareous soil. Known only from North Carolina and western Canada,Bessette et al. (2009), p. 249. L. subtorminosus was named for its similarity to L. torminosus. It can be distinguished by its mild-tasting latex and smaller, roughly spherical spores measuring 5.5‚Äì7 by 5.5‚Äì6.5 Œºm.Hesler and Smith (1979), p. 227. A comparison between Lactarius torminosus (left) and Lactarius pubescens (right) Edibility and toxicity The intensely peppery taste of the raw mushroom can blister the tongue if sampled in excess. Some authors have reported the species as outright poisonous, or causing \\"mild to fatal gastroenteritis\\". In a 1930 publication, Hans Steidle reported that although the mushroom was not toxic to \\"unicellular and cold-blooded organisms\\" when ingested, the liquid extract and the pressed juice of the fruit bodies, when injected under the skin of a frog, resulted in disturbed breathing, paralysis, and eventually death. Symptoms that are typically experienced after consuming raw mushrooms include nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea starting about one hour after ingestion. This combination can lead to dehydration, muscle spasms, and circulatory collapse. The gastroenteritis will usually resolve without treatment in a couple of days. Despite these reports of toxicity, L. torminosus mushrooms are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by parboiling, soaking in brine for several days, or pickling, after which they are valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. Mushrooms are harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.20%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.09%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.01%. Chemistry Structure of the sesquiterpene velleral The compound thought to be responsible for the toxicity of raw L. torminosus is the pungent-tasting velleral present at a concentration of 0.16 mg/g mushroom. Velleral is a breakdown product of stearyl-velutinal. Broken lactifers‚Äîspecialized hyphal cells that produce the mushroom's latex‚Äîleak the precursor chemicals whose breakdown products act as the defensive agents toxic to humans, effectively deterring certain vertebrates that might consume the mushroom. The lactarane-type sesquiterpene lactone 15-hydroxyblennin A is one of several sesquiterpenes produced by the species. Other lactaranes are found in various Lactarius species, such as blennin A in L. deliciosus and L. blennius, and lactarorufin N in Lactarius rufus. Fungal sesquiterpenes are commonly produced as toxins to defend against predation, and as a result some have chemical properties that may have applications in medicinal chemistry. Fruit bodies of Lactarius torminosus contain a number of sterols, of which ergosterol (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds that contribute to the odor of the mushroom. Many of these are alcohols and carbonyl compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms. Ecology and distribution In V√§sterbotten, Sweden Lactarius torminosus is a mycorrhizal species, and as such plays an important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon- colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed. The species is found in northern temperate and boreal climates, penetrating sometimes into subarctic regions. It has been recorded from North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and is common in North America, where it sometimes grows with aspen (Populus species). The North American distribution extends north into the Yukon and Alaska and south to Mexico.

The functionality of this toolset is incorporated into an RPG ILE program by means of a service program that contains all of the procedures required to read input from a browser, generate and send the appropriate response back to the browser. CGIDEV2 is commonly used to generate static or interactive HTML/DHTML pages but it can also produce CSV, XML, Excel-XML and other text based files. CGIDEV2 was developed by Mel Rothman while he was with IBM Rochester. It was released to the public in 1999. The product was maintained and promoted by Mr. Rothman and Dr. Giovanni B. Perotti of IBM Italy, who have added enhancements, documentation and code samples to the package. When Dr. Perotti left IBM, the company at first refused to allow him to maintain the product, then later relented. Because the product is written in RPG ILE and comes with complete source, end users have also been able to contribute enhancements to the package and modify it for their specific requirements. In addition to Perotti and Rothman, CGIDEV2 has been enhanced, promoted, or discussed in detail by Brian May, Jon Paris, Susan Gantner, and Brad Stone. Unlike most web solutions for the iSeries, CGIDEV2 is neither a terminal emulator or an SQL based solution. CGIDEV2 effectively extends widely used RPG programming language with specific procedures for the web. This permits an iSeries programmer to continue to use all of the familiar tools and techniques that they are accustomed to as they develop interactive programs for the web. A particular feature of the CGIDEV2 toolkit is that it allows the programmer to isolate the HTML in one or more external template files from the executing CGI program, with special tokens in the HTML templates being replaced at run-time via toolkit procedures. This separation of the HTML code from the CGI program promotes the efficient and consistent development and subsequent maintenance of enterprise scale business applications. Criticism: While CGIDEV2 is a popular choice as a web development languages for RPG programmers on IBM iSeries systems, CGIDEV2 lacks in some features offered by other web development languages such as session management and the ability to design programs using object oriented design principles. IBM's ambiguous commitment to the CGIDEV2 product and to the iSeries in general is also an issue to some users.

Francis and his father, William R. Stokes, formed two generations of a Portland design and architectural tradition lasting for over 80 years, from 1882 though the 1960s. The combined design work of the Stokes family had a major impact on the architecture of Portland. The William Resor Stokes legacy The work of Francis Marion Stokes continued, and expanded, that of his father William R. Stokes, who arrived in Portland in 1882. In 1883 William joined Richard Zeller in creating the firm of Stokes and Zeller, working as both architects and builders. For forty years, the firm designed churches, schools, hospitals, fraternal buildings and commercial structures with special attention to residences and apartment buildings.Gaston 1911: Vol. 3 page 285 William Stokes worked until 1920, concentrating on buildings on the east side of Portland. Career Residence Tudor at 2737 NE Alameda Francis Marion Stokes was trained in architecture at the Oregon Agricultural College in Corvallis. His training continued under his father's direction during the years he spent as a clerk and architect for Stokes and Zeller. By 1916, Francis was president of Stokes and Zeller, a position he held until 1937. He enlarged the geographical scope of the firm, designing buildings throughout Portland. His designs were more cosmopolitan than those of his father, and used many building styles for over 270 buildings completed during a career that spanned five decades. Most of his work was completed during the 46 years he lived in the Francis Marion Stokes Fourplex, at the time known as the Kuhn Apartments building. Works Dr. F.H. Dammasch Home at 1834 SE 22nd Ave Williams & Company building at 2045 NE M.L.K. Blvd (formerly NE Union Ave) Many of Francis Marion Stokes' buildings are listed on the City of Portland Historic Resource Inventory. They include the Williams & Company Building, 2045 NE M.L.K. Blvd (1936), the F.H. Dammasch Home (1926) at 1834 SE 22nd Avenue, the Sellwood Masonic Lodge at 7126 SE Milwaukie (1930), and the Residence Tudor (1923) at 2737 NE Alameda. At least two of his buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places: the St. Johns Post Office, a Georgian-style building constructed at 8720 N Ivanhoe in 1932, and the Francis Marion Stokes Fourplex, which was also his home from 1929 until his death in 1975 at age 91.

Architecture The St. Johns Post Office is an example of a small community post office constructed in the 20th Century Georgian style (also Colonial Revival-style) typical of Depression Era federal architecture. The building exhibits classical symmetry and proportion, yet is a transitional building in that it lacks the archaeological detail of classically inspired federal architecture of the Beaux-Arts tradition. The building's Georgian style is suggested in the detailing of the arched Palladian windows and termination of the facade with a molded frieze and cornice. The building is also unique among small Oregon post offices in that it was designed by a local architect, Francis Marion Stokes, who designed several architecturally prominent buildings in the Portland area, several of which are included in the city's historic resource inventory. Art The building's lobby features two murals with both a local and state significance. They are titled \\"Development of St. Johns\\" and were completed in 1936 by John Ballator under the auspices of the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture. The murals depict the development of the neighborhood with significant historical events and prominent citizens. Ballator was an artist from Topeka who was born in Portland in 1909.

Distribution  Pandanus spiralis occurs in Queensland, The Northern Territory and the extreme north of Western Australia. The plant is most commonly found growing along watercourses or coastal fringes and dune systems.  Description  Pandanus spiralis is a shrub or small tree up to 10 metres in height. It has long, spiny leaves organised in a spiral arrangement. The plant bears a large, pineapple-like cluster of fruit that turn orange-red when ripe. Wildlife including birds take advantage of the spiny leaves by living in the tree for protection. They also favor its fruit.  Uses  The leaves of P. spiralis can be used to weave neckbands and armbands. The fibre of the leaves can be used as string for dillybags. Other uses include baskets, mats, and shelters. In addition, mashed leaves can be used to cure headaches when tied around the head. The Burarra people use the plant to make fish traps. The fruit's seeds can also be ground to make flour.

Reference is made to James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who is accused of sending the 'Specials' or Ulster Special Constabulary, to 'shoot the people down'. This is a reference to the large number of Catholics who were killed by the Special Constabulary in the conflict. In Christy Moore's version the lyrics in this verse are \\"the Black and Tans from London came to shoot the people down\\" Reference is also made to Seaforde Street in the Short Strand area of east Belfast, which was often the scene of armed encounters between the IRA, British forces and loyalist gunmen. Alternative versions of the song contain a reference to the Falls Road area instead of Seaforde Street. Other lyrics specific to the 1920s are references to armoured cars and Crossley Tenders armoured trucks which were used by the Northern Ireland Security forces at the time. The British use of such heavy weaponry is contrasted with the poor arms possessed by the IRA, who are nevertheless, 'ready to defend ourselves no matter where we go'. The Song Includes the original war cry of the Belfast Brigade, \\"No surrender! Is the war cry of the Belfast Brigade.\\" In some versions of the song, there is an allusion to the politics of the Irish Civil War of 1922-1923, 'We're out for our Republic and to hell with your Free State'. The Belfast Brigade in fact largely supported Michael Collins during the civil war, although many of them changed their opinion when it became clear that the Partition of Ireland would be permanent. In other versions of the song, this internal Republican disagreement is not mentioned, the words being changed to, 'Orangemen may live in dread'. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), the Connolly Column, an Irish volunteer unit of the 15th International Brigade, sang the song while fighting against Francisco Franco's nationalists. In the 1970s, with the onset of The Troubles, another version of the song emerged about the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade. The lyrics were changed to 'the British Army came to Belfast to shoot the people down...'

Just before it meets its fellow it presents a slight enlargement, named by Georg Ludwig Kobelt (1804‚Äì1857) the bulb of the corpus cavernosum penis.

He won the javelin throw event at the 1936 Olympics and placed third in the shot put. St√∂ck was the son of a butcher. He was born in Kaiserswalde in 1911, a small village now located in Poland, and grew up in the Province of Posen. He was a versatile athlete and, besides throwing events, competed in decathlon and won the javelin and pentathlon events at the 1935 World Student Games. Domestically, he won the German javelin title in 1938 and placed second in 1933‚Äì1947. He never won the German shot put title, due to a strong competition from Hans Woellke, and placed second four times. At the 1938 European Championships, St√∂ck won a silver medal in the shot put, surprisingly beating Woellke, but placed only seventh in the javelin throw. St√∂ck had a degree in philology and, since 1938, worked as a teacher. Earlier in 1933, he became a member of the Nazi paramilitary organization, Sturmabteilung, and, in 1944, was promoted to Sturmbannf√ºhrer. After World War II, he continued competing until the early 1950s and then worked as a sports administrator. He served as chef de mission of the Unified German Olympic team in 1956 and 1960 and as deputy chef de mission in 1964. His past military activity was raised only after his death in 1985. Among other things, it was found that he falsified his birth year from 1911 to 1910. St√∂ck was married and raised an athletic family. His daughter, Jutta St√∂ck, became an Olympic sprinter, while his son- in-law, Peter Hertel, was a 1966 world champion in rowing. His grandson, Ole Hertel, was a competitive shot putter and discus thrower.

Career In 1926, he founded his eponymous publishing house in New York City which quickly became one of the largest self-contained publishing houses in the United States. Although several contemporary American works were issued in the 1930s, Kalmus' enterprise increasingly concentrated in publishing classical works that had entered the public domain in the US, making them widely available in inexpensive reprint editions. After moving the firm to Miami in 1971, Kalmus sold the study score, vocal, piano and chamber music titles to Belwin-Mills (1976), though the original company remained independent and continues to publish orchestra, band, and chamber music from its new headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. Divisions and imprints of the Boca Raton firm include The Well-Tempered Press, Masters Music Publications, and Klavier Records. In January 2008, the Cleveland, Ohio music publisher Ludwig Music Publications was purchased and Masters Music division was renamed LudwigMasters Publications. Legacy The Belwin-Mills controlled portion, subsequently taken over by Columbia Pictures Publications, Warner Brothers Publications and ultimately Alfred, continues to publish music with the Kalmus name under the Kalmus Classic Series imprint, the vast majority consisting of inexpensive reprints of old editions now in the public domain.

They were designated as National Heritage Fellows in 1989 by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. The group won the 1998 Grammy for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album. As a quintet, they featured briefly in the 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?. History The initial iteration of the group was under the direction of the church's assistant pastor, J. R. Carrethers, and consisted of his sons Rufus and Harold plus their neighbor John Battle. In 1925, the group became a quartet when Lattimer Green joined. During the 1930s, Green left the group and William Malone and Samuel McCrary joined, but they retained the name of Fairfield Four, although it had expanded its membership beyond a quartet. Following their initial radio broadcast on WSIX, the group gained recognition outside of Nashville. In 1942, the group won a contest that resulted in an appearance on 50,000-watt radio station WLAC, with a hook-up to the CBS network. This performance was so successful that the group continued to perform on WLAC for the next decade, and group members became celebrities within the gospel music genre. During the 1940s, the membership of the group continued to evolve. Their first recording session was held in 1946 at Nashville's Bullet Records and over the next 15 years, the group released over 100 recordings on the Bullet, Delta, Dot, Champion, and Old Town record labels. By 1949, Sam McCrary assumed leadership of the group and they continued to record and tour with various membership changes. \\"The group split up in 1950, and Hill, Freeman, and Lewis moved to Greenville, Alabama, where they founded a new quartet, the Skylarks. McCrary, however, kept the Fairfield Four name and added tenors Willie Love and Willie \\"Little Axe\\" Broadnax to the group.\\" In 1954, McCrary left the group to become a minister. More personnel changes ensued, but by the late 1950s the group's popularity had waned, along with the decline of interest in a cappella gospel singing. The group disbanded in 1960. In 1980, the group re-formed to participate in a special \\"Quartet Reunion\\" program in Birmingham, Alabama, and they performed again in 1981 at a Smithsonian Institution program on \\"Black American Quartet Traditions\\". The revitalized group has continued to perform from the 1980s to the present. In 1993, the group participated in the Gaither Homecoming video and music recording series. They are featured in Turn Your Radio On and Old Friends. The group gained more popular recognition after appearing on John Fogerty's 1997 album Blue Moon Swamp, singing on the track \\"A Hundred and Ten in the Shade\\".

He was Chief Whip of the Irish Party from 1907 until his death in 1917. Pat O'Brien in 1895 Biography Second son of James O‚ÄôBrien of Tullamore, Co. Offaly, he never married. He trained as a mechanical and marine engineer but subsequently moved to Liverpool where he set up a business as a coal merchant. In his early days he was a Fenian and was imprisoned as such. After moving to England he became active in the Land League and in the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain, and was again imprisoned in his capacity as secretary of the Commercial Branch of the Land League in Liverpool. He became known to Parnell who chose him as candidate for North Monaghan at a by-election in February 1886 after Timothy Healy, who had won the seat in 1885, elected to sit for South Londonderry. O‚ÄôBrien was reluctant to stand but yielded to Parnell's instructions to be in Monaghan the following morning. He went to catch the steamer for Ireland without returning home for his coat, but borrowed one which was several sizes too large from a friend he met in the street. In this he appeared at the Party convention. O‚ÄôBrien was very active in the Plan of Campaign in 1887‚Äì90. He was imprisoned 5 times in 1888 and 1890, being given sentences totalling nearly 18 months. He always had a camera with him on Land League campaigns, and took photographs of scenes of eviction which he exhibited on a barge in the Thames opposite the House of Commons to members on the Terrace and crowds on Westminster Bridge. J. P. Hayden described the circumstances of his first encounter with O‚ÄôBrien on 1 January 1888, at a protest meeting at Four Roads, Co. Roscommon. O‚ÄôBrien and James Gilhooly were both speakers, the latter under warrant of arrest under the Coercion Act. In order to protect Gilhooly, Hayden as chair introduced O‚ÄôBrien as Gilhooly and Gilhooly as O‚ÄôBrien. Gilhooly was taken away surreptitiously from the meeting after his speech. The police subsequently followed O‚ÄôBrien thinking he was Gilhooly, and arrested him the next day in Athlone. They had to release him. However he was arrested as himself a few days afterwards for his speech at Four Roads. At the time of the Split over Parnell's leadership in December 1890, O‚ÄôBrien was in prison, but on his release he declared for Parnell. He was made whip of the Parnellite party after Parnell's death in October 1891. At the following election in 1892 the Parnellites did not contest North Monaghan, where a split in the Nationalist vote would probably have given the seat to the Unionist candidate. O'Brien fought Limerick City as a Parnellite instead, but was defeated. He won election as a Parnellite at Kilkenny City in 1895 by the narrow majority of 14 votes and thereafter held this seat unopposed. \\"United Ireland\\" O'Brien as caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, May 1907 When the Irish Party reunited in 1900, O‚ÄôBrien became one of its whips and remained so until his death. He played a key role in the passage of the Home Rule Act 1914 when many voting ambushes were attempted by the opposition. Along with fellow Parnellites Willie Redmond and J. J. Clancy, O'Brien was one of the small circle of political intimates of the leader of the Irish Party, John Redmond. He often spent holidays at Redmond's home at Aghavannagh, Co. Wicklow, and moved there at Redmond's invitation during his last illness. His death from a stroke in July 1917 only a month after Willie Redmond (John Redmond's brother) was killed serving with the 16th (Irish) Division on the Western Front on 9 June 1917 was a devastating blow to John Redmond. Stephen Gwynn recorded of Redmond at O'Brien's funeral that 'Then, and then only in his lifetime people saw him publicly break down; he had to be led away from the grave'.

Uses Sanicula europaea was used in Europe for healing wounds and cleaning. Filtered leaf extracts of sanicula europaea have shown some antiviral properties, inhibiting the replication of type 2 Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV-2). Infusions of sanicle, made with water or wine, were commonly used in France to cure dysentery, ulcers and kidney injuries. To this list Culpeper added that sanicle heals tumours in any part of the body, and alleviates gonorrhoea, bowel pain and more. The roots have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally (as tea) or externally (as ointment) for treatment of disorders of the skin, respiratory tract, locomotor system, gastrointestinal tract, and infections.

They are found in the corpora cavernosa penis. They are involved in the process of erection. Anatomy On entering the cavernous structure from the deep artery of the penis the arteries divide into branches, which are supported and enclosed by the trabeculae. Some of these arteries end in a capillary net-work, the branches of which open directly into the cavernous spaces; others assume a tendril-like appearance, and form convoluted and somewhat dilated vessels, which were named by Rosenm√ºller \\"helicine arteries\\". Clinical significance These arteries have two unique features: an intimal cushion and valves. Sympathetic stimulation maintains a tonic contractile state of the intimal cushion, smooth muscle lying in the center of the artery. This keeps the artery coiled and little blood flow occurs, instead routing to arteriovenous shunts to the deep dorsal vein. Parasympathetic stimulation removes the tonic state and allows vasodilation of the intimal cushion. Blood now pools in the corpora cavernosa, resulting in erection. The valves prevent backflow in the now-tortuous route through the cavernosa. This parasympathetic relaxation response is mediated by a release of nitric oxide (NO). NO binds to the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP in turn triggers relaxation of the smooth muscle and results in dilation of blood vessels. This signal is terminated when cGMP is broken down by the enzyme cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme that is targeted by sildenafil and other drugs that treat erectile dysfunction. By preventing PDE5 from breaking down cGMP, the effects of NO are amplified and vasodilation occurs, thus resulting in increased penile erection.

Released in 1998, it is the band's 15th album, and the first album the band recorded without founding member Maddy Prior. Gay Woods provides most of the lead vocals, although the other three members of the band all do the lead singing on at least one song each. Liam Genockey, who had played drums on the band's previous two albums also departed, so most of the songs employ minimal or no percussion, although Woods plays tambourine or bodhran on several songs, and Dave Mattacks, formerly of Fairport Convention, mans a drum kit on three songs. The overall result is an album that has a very strong folk flavour, with rather less rock elements than on previous albums, and one that has much in common with Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again. The tunes tend to be simpler and the performances more subdued, and in some ways the album is a return to the sound the band had on its first three albums. The album also has a strong Irish influence, with songs such as \\"The Old Turf Fire\\", \\"Erin\\", \\"The Bonny Irish Boy\\", and \\"The Parting Glass\\" all being of Irish origin. Woods' vocal style is distinctly different from Prior's, being more earthy and often more 'in character'. Unusually, the album has no instrumental pieces. Peter Knight summed up the album with the comment that \\"Horkstow Grange was very much the sound of four musicians marking their territory and coming out with something different to what's gone before.\\" Perhaps because of the many differences between this album and Steeleye's core sound, this album was not well received, with many fans suggesting that it was somehow not Steeleye Span without Maddy Prior. Much of the criticism from fans focused on Woods, perhaps because her singing is so prominent on the album and because she had become the band's frontwoman. The album's highlight is probably \\"The Parting Glass\\". Its minimal instrumentation allows Woods to demonstrate the strength of her voice. Other highlights include \\"The Old Turf Fire\\" and \\"I Wish That I Never Was Married\\", both also sung by Woods. \\"One True Love\\" is also the first Steeleye Span song to feature Tim Harries on lead vocals. The album's title refers to a traditional English song, first collected by Percy Grainger, one of the early proponents of collecting traditional music. The song is about a quarrel between John Steeleye Span and one of his servants. The song was the inspiration for the band's name, but they only got around to recording the song 28 years after first forming. The track \\"Australia\\" is dedicated to Nigel Pegrum, the band's former drummer, who moved to Australia.

No segment of SR 99 is included within the National Highway System, a network of highways identified as being most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense. History SR 99 was designated in 1923. It was originally routed along its current alignment from its present southern terminus at US 224, at the time known as SR 17, to its junction with what is today the concurrency of US 20 and SR 18 in Monroeville, but in 1923 was a part of SR 2. In 1937, the highway was extended north from Monroeville through its present northern terminus at SR 4, and then continuing northwest from there along Skadden Road, and north along Bardshar Road before coming to an end at its intersection with US 6 in the western end of Sandusky. By 1966, SR 99 was shortened to its present routing when the portions of the highway along Skadden Road and Bardshar Road north of SR 4 were removed from the state highway system, and jurisdiction of these roadways was turned over to Erie County.

It is native to the eastern United States. The Delmarva fox squirrel was removed from the endangered species list in November 2015. Background The Delmarva fox squirrel (Sciurus niger cinereus) was an endangered subspecies of the fox squirrel. Its historical range included the Delmarva Peninsula, southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, but its natural occurrence is now limited to parts of the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia. In these areas the Delmarva fox squirrel's habitat has been degraded and its survivability rates have decreased. It has, however, been successfully reintroduced in other parts of its historical range. Like all fox squirrels, the Delmarva fox squirrel has a full, fluffy tail. The Delmarva fox squirrel is frosty silver to slate gray with a white belly and can grow to be long, including up to of tail. They weigh around three pounds. The Delmarva fox squirrel like many squirrel species, use trees to elude predators. Their preferred habitat is mature forest of both hardwood and pine trees with an open understory. An open understory within the forest is needed for the squirrels to successfully feed on nuts and seeds of the many trees such as oaks, hickories, sweet gum, walnut, and loblolly pine during the fall season when these trees are dispersing their seeds. In the summer and early fall they often feed on mature green pine cones. Other less important food sources include buds, fruit, insects, and grain. These fox squirrels prefer to make their dens in the hollows of trees. However, they will also make a nest of leaves and twigs in the crotch of a tree, in a tangle of vines on a tree trunk, or near the end of a large branch. Mating occurs in late winter and early spring. Gestation is about 44 days, with most young born between February and April. Litters average 1‚Äì6 young, which the female raises by herself. Over the past several years the populations of Delmarva fox squirrels have been declining rapidly and in 1967 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed them as an endangered species. Conservation Delmarva fox squirrel in Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge The Delmarva fox squirrel was listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1967. A recovery plan was developed in 1979 and revised in 1983 and 1993. A principal strategy for species recovery is protection of its habitat. The Delmarva fox squirrel was listed as an endangered species in 1967 because only 10% of its historical population was remaining. The cause of their significant decline in individuals was due to overhunting and habitat loss or destruction. Habitat destruction has been influenced by timber harvesting and farm land production. Housing developments, roads and increased commercial property are some other major factors for the continued loss of habitat. Along with human induced causes, predation plays a large role in the decline of numbers. Red and gray foxes, weasels, minks, eagles and other animals are the cause of high predation rates as the Delmarva fox squirrel‚Äôs habitat is within their range. Many efforts have been made to restore habitat and increase the number of Delmarva fox squirrels within their historical range. In 1979, the first recovery plan was developed to protect the habitat and increase the population of the Delmarva fox squirrel. In completing this plan, the biologists projected that the habitat would become more suitable to the lifestyle of the squirrels as well as other animals that share the same habitat. The plan consisted of 11 sites in Maryland that attempted to reintroduce between 8 and 42 individuals within a 1‚Äì3 year process. At each site the same number of males and females were released to assess the reproduction rates and survivability of each sex. Many tests were done after reintroduction by live trapping and recruitment within 9 of the overall 11 sites. In a more recent conservation effort many private and publicly owned lands were used to serve as habitat restoration areas. Private lands within the Delmarva fox squirrel range constitute for ~87% of the entire historical range of the DFS, while only 13% is of public land. A relationship between both public and private land owners allowed habitat restoration to occur in the 1990s. Different techniques were used by the Chesapeake Bay/Susquehanna River Ecoteam on public lands to monitor and reintroduce the Delmarva fox squirrel. Many private land owners also contributed to the restoration process by allowing biologists to assess their land. Within the recovery plan made in the late 1970s, the idea of translocations was a prominent tool used to increase the population of the Delmarva fox squirrel. The most recent effort allowed for trapping and relocation of the Delmarva fox squirrel to different habitats that would allow them to survive. The major goals were to reduce the probability of extinction, restore ecological diversity, and broaden the involvement of many areas in conservation effort. Eighty-three squirrels were used in this effort and they were all radio-collared for post-release tracking. The radio collars let biologists study the range and movements of the squirrels and tracked the distance traveled within a certain time period. The Delmarva fox squirrel conservation effort has been an increasing success. The population within the historical range has increased and the many efforts have allowed for the habitats to become better suited for the Delmarva fox squirrel. Many issues have threatened the Delmarva fox squirrel with extinction, but continued work to restore habitat must be done in order for this species to have a sustainable population and for the Delmarva fox squirrel to remain off the Endangered Species List.

The Great Rumpus Cat is a fictional character from T.S. Eliot's 1939 book Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats and in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1981 musical, Cats. The Great Rumpus Cat appears in the poem \\"Of the Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles.\\" The poem describes a contentious encounter between a Peke and a Pollicle dog which eventually leads to the participation of other dogs and a great deal of barking, heard throughout the park. The Great Rumpuscat nonchalantly intervenes and scatters the dogs merely by his threatening appearance and a single great leap. The Great Rumpuscat is described as having blazing eyes, great jaws, and a fierce and hairy presence. Of the dogs in the poem, the Pollicle is referring to many types of dogs, whereas the Pekes, Poms, and Pugs all correspond to actual breeds. The Pollicle is a dog who is a stray and wilder than pets. In Cats, the Jellicles put on a small play when their leader, Old Deuteronomy, arrives. The story is about how Rumpus Cat stopped two neighboring dog clans, the Pekes and Pollicles, from fighting. Steven Wayne played the part in the original London West End production, doubling as George, and Kenneth Ard, doubling as Macavity created the part on Broadway. It appears, as his costume in the film version suggests, that he is considered a type of superhero in the Jellicle society. In the film version, Rumpus Cat is played by Frank Thompson who also plays Admetus. In the 2016 Broadway Revival The Rumpus Cat is played by Christopher Gurr who also plays Bustopher Jones and Gus the Theater Cat. The rumpus cat is a replacement to Growltiger in this revival.

It lies approximately north-west of Norwich city centre and has a population of 11,132, according to the 2011 Census. Norwich International Airport is located In the parish.  History  Hellesdon has signs of very early settlement. A variety of flint instruments have been unearthed in and around Hellesdon, thought to date back at least 4,000 years. A collection of bronze axe heads were found near Hellesdon Hall, and a skeleton dating from around 600 AD was discovered next to Hellesdon Lodge in Low Road. The Dictionary of British Place-names indicates that the name Hellesdon comes from H√¶gelisdun (the spelling of the location c.985), meaning 'hill of a man named H√¶gel', with the spelling having changed to Hailesduna by 1086. H√¶gelisdun is recorded in tradition as the location where King Edmund was killed by Viking invaders in 869, although there is no consensus on the location of this event. Hellesdon was one of several manors owned in the fifteenth century by Sir John Fastolf, the original of Shakespeare's Falstaff, and as with other of his properties, his death in 1459 led to something close to a private war between the Paston family and John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk for its possession. In the 1880s, the railway reached Hellesdon, linking it to nearby Norwich, bur Hellesdon railway station closed in the 1950s. In 1915 Mann Egerton built H1s, Spads and Type B seaplanes in Hellesdon. In the 1920s, construction of the Norwich ring road began, making Hellesdon much more accessible. From 1930‚Äì64, motorcycle speedway team the Norwich Stars raced at the old Firs raceway. Ove Fundin was World Speedway Champion on a number of occasions in the early 1960s. The stadium was sold for housing in 1964, bringing the Norwich Stars speedway team to an end. The area has now developed into a major suburb of Norwich.  Amenities  Hellesdon has a number of small independent shops. A large Asda superstore opened in 1983, and a petrol filling station was added to the store site in 1990. The area also has a B&Q; store, six schools (one high school, two junior schools and three infant schools), and Norwich International Airport. The high school, Hellesdon High School, is a leading-edge academy. Norwich airport is owned by the Rigby Group, and flights travel to destinations throughout Europe, as well as the British Isles. There is a library, and a community centre for use by local clubs such as Hellesdon Horticultural Association and the Hellesdon Community Choir. The local football team, Hellesdon FC, play at the community centre. The community centre was used to hold the World Cycle Speedway championships in 1987. There are two pubs in Hellesdon, The Whiffler and The Chestnut Tree, which was formally called The Bull. The roundabout adjacent to The Chestnut Tree is still referred to as ‚ÄúThe Bull roundabout‚Äù and some residents objected to the name change as The Bull had a long history in the area. The former pub The Man On The Moon is now the Hellesdon doctor's surgery. Another former pub, The Bignold Arms, is now a fish restaurant and takeaway, and \\"The Firs\\" is now a Tesco Express. The Falcon became a Co-op Daily, but this closed in 2019. The building is now an office location. There are several other leisure destinations including Funky's roller skating club and a snooker hall. There are also several parks and green spaces although the golf course has been sold for further residential housing developments, potentially increasing the village population significantly. Hellesdon has a large psychiatric hospital (Hellesdon Hospital) but many of the former ward buildings are no longer occupied and the upper level of the site is destined to be sold for housing development. Situated next to the hospital, is the East of England Ambulance Service Norwich Office, which includes its AOC (Ambulance Operations Centre), Helledson Response Post and a Training Centre, along with a vehicle workshop. The parish church of St Mary dates from the 15th century and is a grade II* listed building. John Middleton (Norfolk Museums Collections).

It was published in 1922 by Porter Grainger and Everett Robbins. The song features a lyrical theme of freedom of choice and a vaudeville jazz‚Äìstyle musical arrangement. It was first recorded, as \\"'Tain't Nobody's Biz-ness if I Do\\", in 1922 by Anna Meyers, backed by the Original Memphis Five. Recordings by other classic female blues singers, including Sara Martin, Alberta Hunter, and Bessie Smith soon followed. In 1947, the song was revived by the jump blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon as \\"Ain't Nobody's Business\\". It was the best-selling race record of 1949 and inspired numerous adaptations of the song. In 2011, Witherspoon's rendition was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame as a \\"Classic of Blues Recording\\". Composition and lyrics The early versions of \\"Ain't Nobody's Business\\" feature vocals with piano and sometimes horn accompaniment. They are performed as moderate-tempo blues and have an extended sixteen-bar introduction: The remaining verses are eight bars in length, with the first four describing a situation, such as \\"If I go to church on Sunday, then cabaret on Monday\\", and the last four concluding with the refrain \\"Tain't nobody's biz-ness if I do\\". The song's eight-bar chord scheme was a model for subsequent \\"bluesy\\" Tin Pan Alley songs and R&B; ballads in an AABA form.

His finger-style acoustic guitar version uses a simple I-IV-V chord progression and different lyrics, including the refrain \\"It ain't nobody's business but mine\\". In the post‚ÄìWorld War II blues era, the jump blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon revived the song as \\"Ain't Nobody's Business\\". He performed it in the West Coast blues style with understated backing by piano, guitar, bass, drums, and a three-piece horn section. The song was recorded in Los Angeles on November 15, 1947, and released by Supreme Records in September 1948. It entered the record chart on March 5, 1949, and reached number one. Witherspoon's song was the best-selling R&B; record of 1949. Recognition and influence In 2011, Witherspoon's \\"Ain't Nobody's Business\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame.

About  A custom build Chopper bicycle While the term \\"chopper\\" is generally used to describe a motorcycle or bicycle that has had some of its original parts replaced with custom parts, today's definition has grown to include custom motorcycles and bicycles that are low to the ground, usually with extended forks creating a long front end.

There are various cycling groups and clubs around the world that feature chopper bicycle riders, such as the Choppercabras, Chopaderos, DHC Den Haag Cruisin', Freakbike Militia, Cranksters, SCUL, and C.h.u.n.k. 666. Such groups encourage all chopper bicycle riders to join them on rides celebrating different events and holidays. Because the frame of a chopper bicycle and a chopper motorcycle can be strikingly similar, and of a high enough quality/durability, it is relatively common to have an empty space, or 'engine bay', in the frame, in which a motor can be inserted into the frame at a later date, among other tweaks and conversions. Depending on the quality of strength of the frame, and the engines size and output, this can result in blurring between the classifications of bicycle, moped, and/ or motorcycle.

It also serves the nearby villages of Westwood and Winsley, and Turleigh hamlet. It is situated next to the Kennet and Avon Canal and located almost adjacent to the Avoncliff Aqueduct, so it is popular with walkers and cyclists who wish to travel along the canal path or the picturesque walks around the station. The station has two platforms, each long enough for coaches, with a waiting shelter and original lamp-posts, and is served by Great Western Railway. Residents have voluntarily decorated the station with many pots of flowers and, to mark its 100-year anniversary on 9 July 2006, decorated the station with bunting and dressed in Victorian clothing for the celebrations. History Opened on the Wessex Main Line by the Great Western Railway as Avoncliff Halt on 9 July 1906, it remained part of that company during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed to the Western Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The suffix 'Halt' was dropped from 5 May 1969. When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Railways. The station was a request stop until July 2010, when all stops became mandatory. Services A generally hourly service is provided by Great Western Railway, northbound to Bath and Bristol and southbound to Bradford on Avon, Trowbridge and Westbury, with some trains continuing to Weymouth and Southampton. The service is less frequent on Sundays. Other GWR services and South Western Railway services between and , pass through the station but do not stop.

The song was produced and written by Dan Hartman, arranged by Norman Harris, and mixed by Tom Moulton. It was a hit on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart, where the song spent a week at No. 1 in September 1980.  Development  Originally, Hartman envisioned either Bette Midler or Patti LaBelle as singing \\"Love Sensation\\". However, after seeing Holloway perform at a nightclub, he approached her instead to sing the vocals. In various interviews, Holloway recalled that Hartman had her perform the song 29 times over a two-day recording session. She lost her voice as a result, and only recovered by putting Vicks VaporRub in her coffee.  Samples  Since the rise of the remix culture during the 1980s, \\"Love Sensation\\" has been heavily sampled with large portions of the song incorporated into other works. The original 1989 release of \\"Ride on Time\\" by Black Box sampled Holloway's \\"Thank you baby, 'cause you're right (sic) on time\\" lyric before a rerecording as well as instrumental portions by the Salsoul Orchestra, and Hartman received writing credit. In 1991, \\"Good Vibrations\\" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch lifted a sample of Holloway's singing. She received singing credit on the No. 1 song, giving Holloway her highest U.S. pop chart hit. Holloway even made an appearance performing the chorus in the music video. \\"Good Vibrations\\" itself has been frequently sampled with the inclusion of Holloway's contribution. Parts of the song have been sampled and re-used in songs such as: *\\"I Wanna Have Some Fun\\" (1988) by Samantha Fox *\\"Ride On Time\\" (1989) by Black Box * \\"I Don't Know Anybody Else\\" (1989) by Black Box/Martha Wash. *\\"Grand Piano\\" by Mixmaster *\\"Dance 2 Trance\\" (1990) by Dance 2 Trance *\\"Good Vibrations\\" (1991) by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch *\\"We All Feel Better in the Dark\\" by the Pet Shop Boys *\\"Move\\" (1993) by Moby *\\"Take Me Away\\" (1991) by Cappella *\\"Take Me Away\\" by 2 in a Room (using the same sample as Cappella) *\\"(You Got Me) Burnin' Up\\" with Cevin Fisher *\\"Take Me Away\\" (2008) by Chase & Status *\\"Blind Faith\\" (2011) by Chase & Status *\\"Love Sensation\\" (2006) by Eddie Thoneick & Kurd Maverick *\\"Just Like A Queen\\" by Ellis Dee *\\"Overtime\\" (2013) by Cash Cash *\\"Bootleg Fireworks (Burning Up)\\" (2012) by Dillon Francis *\\"Day and Night\\" feat.

It is located in the territory of the commune of Montvalezan, in the Savoie department, at above sea level and top height, and faces south with fine views across the valley to nearby Les Arcs. It was developed in the early 1950s on the site of an old hamlet, and was linked with the nearby Italian resort of La Thuile in 1984 via two fairly long drag lifts through the Little St Bernard Pass. Compared to its neighbour, Val d'Is√®re, La Rosi√®re is relatively small, with of piste. The ski area of l'Espace San Bernardo (which includes La Thuile) caters for all abilities: as of early 2008, it provides 6 green and 23 blue slopes for beginners, and 32 red and 6 black runs for the more advanced skiers. A notable feature on the higher pistes is the Redoute Ruin√©e, a border fort built by France in the early 1890s after the loss of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany in 1870, as part of a general strengthening of the borders. It was heavily reinforced between 1936 and 1940 as part of the Alpine Line, in anticipation of invasion from Italy. In June 1940, during the Battle of France at the start of World War II, a small force of 47 men resisted several attacks from Italy, before being allowed to leave with the flag after the Armistice with Germany. The fort suffered heavy damage when French forces attempted to retake it towards the end of the war. It is now ruined, and public access to the interior is prohibited for safety reasons. Hannibal is thought to have marched his elephants through this area on his passage through the Alps.

Plot A pastor adopts a young blind girl whom his daughter, Charlotte, names \\"Gertrude\\". The title refers to Beethoven's Sixth Symphony (also known as the Pastoral Symphony) which the pastor takes Gertrude to hear. It also refers to the pastor's own symphony with Gertrude. His wife, Am√©lie, resents Gertrude because the pastor dedicates more attention to Gertrude than to their five children. She tries to prompt him to a recognition of the true nature of his feelings for the young woman in his care. Her ability to \\"see\\" is contrasted with the \\"blindness\\" of the pastor in this regard and the reader is invited to judge him on his intellectual dishonesty. As a religious man, the pastor takes the Bible very seriously and tries to preserve Gertrude's innocence by protecting her from the concept of sin. Because the pastor is really the main character in Gertrude's limited world, she feels herself to be in love with him and to some extent he has similar feelings toward her. When his eldest son Jacques, who is about the same age as Gertrude, asks to marry her, the pastor becomes jealous and refuses despite the fact that Jacques is obviously in love with her. Gertrude eventually gets an operation to repair her eyesight and, having gained the ability to see, realizes that she loves Jacques and not the pastor. However, Jacques has renounced his love for her, converted to Catholicism and become a monk. Gertrude attempts suicide by jumping into a river, but this fails and she's rescued and contracts pneumonia. She realizes that the pastor is an old man, and the man she pictured when she was blind was Jacques. She tells the pastor this shortly before her death. Adaptations The work was made into a film in 1946 by Jean Delannoy, with Mich√®le Morgan in the principal role as Gertrude. A version was produced for Australian television in 1958.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MlFVAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=nJUDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4647%2C900469 Thematic analysis The story deals with the idea of blindness; although Gertrude is evidently blind physically, the pastor himself is blind in his morality, seemingly unaware of the full extent of his sinfulness in his obsession for Gertrude. As well as blindness, sin is a prevalent concept in the novel. The pastor treats the love that Jacques feels for Gertrude as a sin without taking into account that he himself, as a married man and a religious figure, has profound emotional sentiments for a young girl whom he adopted almost as a daughter. He also fails to take into account the fact that as a pastor he would inevitably be viewed by his congregation to be someone who should present himself as an example of strong virtues and high moral values.

One viewpoint, from IBM IBM SOA pages, Definition of SOA Governance and others, is that SOA governance is an extension (subset) of IT governance which itself is an extension of corporate governance. The implicit assumption in this view is that services created using SOA are just one more type of IT asset in need of governance, with the corollary that SOA governance does not apply to IT assets that are \\"not SOA\\". A contrasting viewpoint, expressed by blogger Dave Oliver Dave Oliver's Blog, What is SOA Governance? and others, is that service orientation provides a broad organising principle for all aspects of IT in an organisation ‚Äî including IT governance. Hence SOA governance is nothing but IT governance informed by SOA principles. The focus of SOA governance is on those resources to deliver value to the business. SOA systems require IT support processes as well as organizational processes that will also involve the business leaders. SOA needs a solid foundation that is based on standards and includes policies, contracts, and service level agreements. The IT community is expected to use services to quickly automate new and changing business processes. To do so, services should be produced with several design qualities, such as composability, loose-coupling, autonomy, data representation standardization. In addition, a SOA governance infrastructure should be in place to support the service delivery life-cycle, which includes a registry of services to enable service discovery. Consequently, SOA increases the need for good governance as it will help assign decision-making authorities, roles, and responsibilities and bring focus to the organizational capabilities needed to be successful.  Definition  The definitions of SOA governance agree in its purpose of exercising control, but differ in the responsibilities it should have. Some narrow definitions focus on imposing policies and monitoring services, while other definitions use a broader business-oriented perspective. Anne Thomas Manes defines governance as: ‚ÄúThe processes that an enterprise puts in place to ensure that things are done [...] in accordance with best practices, architectural principles, government regulations, laws, and other determining factors. SOA governance refers to the processes used to govern adoption and implementation of SOA.‚Äù Anne Thomas Manes, The Elephant Has Left The Building, 1 July 2005 The specific focus of SOA governance is on the development of services that add value to the business, effective SOA governance must cover the people, processes, and technologies involved in the entire SOA life cycle from business point of view and connectivity and reuse from IT point of view, thus aligning business with IT. To quote Anne Thomas Manes again: ‚ÄúSOA is about behavior, not something you build or buy. You have to change behavior to make it effective.‚Äù Philip J. Windley, SOA Governance: Rules of the Game , InfoWorld.com, 23 January 2006 Gartner defines SOA Governance as ‚ÄúEnsuring and validating that assets and artifacts within the architecture are acting as expected and maintaining a certain level of quality.‚Äù Gartner, Magic Quadrant for SOA Governance, 2007 ISO 38500 describes a framework with six guiding principles for corporate governance of information technology and a model for directors to govern IT with three main tasks: evaluate, direct and control. ISO 38500 differentiates between \\"Governance\\", \\"Management\\" and \\"Control\\".  Scope  Some typical governance issues that are likely to emerge in a SOA are: * Delivering value to the stakeholders: investments are expected to return a benefit to the stakeholders - this is equally true for SOA. * Compliance to standards or laws: IT systems require auditing to prove their compliance to regulations like the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act. In a SOA, service behavior is often unknown. * Change management: changing a service often has unforeseen consequences as the service consumers are unknown to the service providers. This makes an impact analysis for changing a service more difficult than usual. * Ensuring quality of services: The flexibility of SOA to add new services requires extra attention for the quality of these services. This concerns both the quality of design and the quality of service. As services often call upon other services, one malfunctioning service can cause damage in many applications. Some key activities that are often mentioned as being part of SOA governance are: * Managing the portfolio of services: planning development of new services and updating current services * Managing the service lifecycle: meant to ensure that updates of services do not disturb current service consumers * Using policies to restrict behavior: rules can be created to which all services must conform, ensuring consistency of services * Monitoring performance of services: because of service composition, the consequences of service downtime or underperformance can be severe. By monitoring service performance and availability, action can be taken instantly when a problem occurs. * Managing how and by whom services are usedWohl Associates, SOA Governance An IBM White Paper, October 2006 (http://www-01.ibm.com/software/solutions/soa/Amy_Wohl_SOA_Governance_Analyst_White_Paper.pdf) See also *Governance Interoperability Framework  References  Category:Service-oriented (business computing) Category:Information technology governance ","title":"SOA governance"},{"id":"8004445","text":"Shield of the Petulantes seniores, an auxilia palatina unit under the command of the magister peditum. Pattern according to Notitia Dignitatum. Petulantes was an auxilia palatina of the Late Roman army.  History  It is possible they fought in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge for Emperor Constantine I (312). This assumption is based on the fact that Constantine had possibly had them portrayed on his triumphal arch in Rome. In the 4th century, the Petulantes were in the army of the Caesar of the West Julian. The unit amounted to 500 men, but, in order to obtain a tactically valid unit, they were often united with the Celtae.MacDowall, p. 21. As part of Julian's army, the Petulantes took part in the victorious Battle of Strasbourg (357). When Julian, camped in Lutetia, received the order from his cousin the Emperor Constantius II to send some troops (including the Petulantes) to the east, the troops revolted, because Julian had promised to keep them near their families. One of the standard-bearers of the Petulantes, Maurus, put the crown on Julian's head, proclaiming him Augustus (361).Ammianus Marcellinus, xx.4.18. Together with the Celtae, the Petulantes fought against the Alamanni near Sanctium, in Raetia.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxi.3.2-3. In 365, the Augustus Senior of the west, Valentinian I, and the Augustus Iunior of the east, Valens, divided the army in two parts, and it is possible that in this occasion the Petulantes were divided into two units, the seniores and the iuniores. The Notitia Dignitatum, an early-5th century document, lists the Petulantes seniores among the auxilia palatina, the elite units, under the command of the magister peditum of the west.The similarity of the emblem of the Petulantes (a twin-dragon) with those of the other auxilia palatina (Cornuti, Brachiati and Celtae) could be interpreted as the legions being raised together (Speidel, p. 47). The same document gives the Petulantes iuniores under the command of the magister militum per Illyricum, with a different shield pattern.Notitia Dignitatum, in partibus Orientis, ix.

The program's scenario resembles a medieval castle, in order to give a fairy tale atmosphere to it. The whole choosing process includes getting to know the \\"toads\\"' bedrooms, presented by close friends of theirs, asking the \\"toads\\" several questions, and even getting them to sing the \\"prince\\" or \\"princess\\" a song, with new lyrics written by themselves, often begging them a chance.

Plot The Stooges play the roles of unsuccessful actors who have decided to end it all by jumping off a skyscraper. On top of the building, they discover three girls with an unsuccessful dancing act who have also decided to jump. The Stooges immediately fall in love with the girls. The six distraught lovers are still planning to jump when they suddenly hear piano music playing. They leave the ledge to go find the source of the music. On a lower floor they discover a piano-playing millionaire who is looking for a talented act. He promises them a significant amount of money if they are good. Their act is a success with the millionaire, who doubles their salaries and says, \\"The way I throw my money around, I bet you think I'm crazy!\\" As if on cue, two men in white coats come to take him back to an asylum.

The 42-year-old comedian had suffered a series of minor strokes over the previous 16 months prior to filming, and his performances had been unpredictable. By the time of Rhythm and Weep, he had lost a considerable amount of weight, and lines had creased his face. While director Edward Bernds devised ways to cover his illness, Jules White simply gave most of Curly's lines to Larry. In fact, Curly was so ill during production that he could no longer remember what few lines he had. Moe's son-in-law Norman Maurer was present during filming, and recalled Curly was hurting. \\"He was having trouble with his coordination,\\" recalled Maurer. \\"He was supposed to pop pills in his mouth during the (doctor's office) scene, but the scene was switched to Moe putting the pills into Curly's mouth because of Curly's physical problems.\\"Lenburg, Jeff; Howard Maurer, Joan; Lenburg, Greg; (1982).

Xenobots - European title) is an MS-DOS computer game in which the player controls a group of giant robots and battles other giant robots. The game was developed by Novalogic and published by Electronic Arts. Gameplay Gameplay consists of deploying a group of robots to an area and engaging enemy forces. Both sides will typically have a number of robots and a base to protect. Damaged robots can return to the base for repairs. As robots take damage they will become harder to control and use as various systems fail. The user can take direct control of one of the robots in field at will, or leave them autonomous in field and provide only strategic goal-driven control from the base. Robots There are three types of robots available in the game. *Humanoid is the main fighting robot. It is the strongest robot available and can deliver and take the most damage. *Scorpion is the infrastructure maintenance robot. It is slow, fragile, and weak in close combat, but it carries a single-shot missile (its scorpion stinging tail) that is the heaviest weapon in the game. Only Scorpions can lay down or dismantle the power grid. *Scout is the fast agile robot used for recon. It is lightly armed but has the longest range when running on batteries, and is capable of laying mines.  Power grid  A unique feature of Ultrabots is the power grid consisting of microwave relays that extend power away from the base dome. Robots straying too far from the base dome or relays have to rely on their batteries only, which don't last long and don't offer enough range to reach the enemy base. Much of strategy in the game relies on the power infrastructure, with Scorpions extending lines of relays toward the enemy that Scouts discover far from grid, under protection of Humanoids, to prepare a full attack on the enemy base. Reception Computer Gaming World called Ultrabots \\"a very novel and worthwhile experience\\".

He is best known for The Hinges of History series, a prospective seven-volume series in which the author recounts formative moments in Western civilization. Biography Born in New York City to Irish-American parents and raised in Queens and the Bronx Cahill studied ancient Greek and Latin at Regis High School in Manhattan. He continued his study of Greek and Latin literature, as well as medieval philosophy, scripture, and theology, at Fordham University, where he completed a B.A. in classical literature and philosophy in 1964, and a pontifical degree in philosophy in 1965. He went on to complete his M.F.A. in film and dramatic literature at Columbia University in 1968. In anticipation of writing The Gifts of the Jews, Cahill studied scripture at Union Theological Seminary in New York, and spent two years as a Visiting Scholar at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he studied Hebrew and the Hebrew Bible. He also reads French and Italian. In 1999, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Alfred University in New York. Cahill has been a contributor to Irish America magazine. Cahill has taught at Queens College, Fordham University, and Seton Hall University; served as the North American education correspondent for the Times of London, and was for many years a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times Book Review. Prior to retiring to writing full-time, he was the director of religious publishing at Doubleday for six years. He and his wife, Susan, also an author, divide their time between New York and Rome. Cahill's book, A Saint on Death Row: The Story of Dominique Green, is a departure from The Hinges of History series. It is both the story of Dominique Green, a young man from Houston who was on Death Row in Texas, and of the effect that knowing him had on Cahill. Arrested at age eighteen in the fatal shooting of a man during a robbery outside a Houston convenience store, Green acknowledged he took part in the robbery but insisted he did not pull the trigger. Cahill first heard about Green from Judge Sheila Murphy who was working on the appeal of the case. She requested that he visit Green, which he did in December 2003. So impressed was Cahill with Green that he joined the ultimately-unsuccessful fight for Green's life, even enlisting Green's hero, Desmond Tutu, to make a historic visit to Dominique and to plead publicly for mercy. Green was executed at the age of 30 on October 26, 2004, after spending twelve years on Death Row. Green made a final statement before his execution: \\"There was a lot of people that got me to this point and I can't thank them all. But thank you for your love and support. They have allowed me to do a lot more than I could have on my own. I have overcome a lot. I am not angry but I am disappointed that I was denied justice. But I am happy that I was afforded you all as family and friends. I love you all. Please just keep the struggle going. I am just sorry and I am not as strong as I thought I was going to be. But I guess it only hurts for a little while. You are all my family.

The edifice was completed in 2001 and designed by architects Rena Wandel-Hoefer and Wolfgang Lorch. It was built on the same location as the Semper Synagogue (1839‚Äì1840) designed by Gottfried Semper, which was destroyed in 1938, during the Kristallnacht. The boundary wall of the New Synagogue incorporates the last remaining fragments of Semper's original building. The outer walls of the synagogue are built slightly off plumb, intended by the architect to convey the feeling that the Jewish community has always been slightly set off from the German city. The synagogue is also a contrast to the city center with which it is juxtaposed. It is set on a slight rise just at the edge of Dresden's baroque center, which was completely flattened by allied bombing during the war. The center is being rebuilt with buildings whose exteriors (and in the case of the more significant buildings, also interiors, though not construction materials,) are precise replicas of the baroque royal city that long made Dresden famous. The synagogue stands beside this careful reproduction of the past, but it is not a replica of the historic Semper Synagogue. It is a modernist statement that contrasts with its neighbors. Inside, the sanctuary building is a cube (all service functions are located in the companion building set at the other end of a stone plaza.) Within this cube is set a square worship space, curtained off on all four sides by an enormous draping of curtains made of chain-mesh in a golden metal, evoking an echo of the scale of the Temple at Jerusalem. The building was shortlisted by the jury for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2003.EU Press release, May 22 2003 On New Year%27s Eve (Silvester in German) in 2012, the mail box was broken at the entrance to the synagogue in Dresden and a blasphemous inscription was spray-painted on the external wall, which was interpreted as an anti-Semitic act.

The difficulties involved in crossing the immense distances between galaxies are often overlooked in this type of science fiction. M31 (Andromeda Galaxy) Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy in the Local Group, imaged in ultraviolet light The Andromeda Galaxy has appeared in a number of science fiction works, as a source of alien life forms that invade the Milky Way galaxy, or as a setting for alien worlds and territories. Examples include the following: =Literature= * The novel Andromeda Nebula by Ivan Yefremov is named after the Andromeda Galaxy, even though the galaxy itself is only mentioned once, towards the end of the book. * Much of the fighting in the Revelation Space universe by Alastair Reynolds is caused by one race attempting to prepare the Milky Way for the impending collision with Andromeda, and attempting to wipe out any other race (including humanity) to prevent them interfering. * The Andromeda Galaxy plays an important role in the German space opera Perry Rhodan, from the third cycle on. =Comics= * In Superman: Birthright, writer Mark Waid describes Krypton as a megagravity planet circling an M3 star in the Andromeda Galaxy. * In Marvel Comics, the Skrull empire consists mainly of \\"about a thousand worlds\\" in the Andromeda galaxy. The Nova Corps of Xandar, and the Symbiotes of Klyntar are also from the Andromeda galaxy. * In Schlock Mercenary, the Fleetmind Artificial Intelligence character known as Petey (also P.D., Post-Dated Check Loan, Sword of Inevitable Justice, The Rogue) is currently prosecuting a war against the Paan'uri in their home galaxy of Andromeda. =Film and television= * In the 1961 BBC television series A for Andromeda, co-authored by astronomer Fred Hoyle, a radio signal is received from the direction of the Andromeda Galaxy. The signal contained instructions for building a super-computer, as well as the code needed to make it run. A year later the sequel series The Andromeda Breakthrough was released. * In The Galaxy Being, the debut episode of The Outer Limits (1963 TV series), an engineer for a small radio station somehow makes contact with a peaceful alien creature from the Andromeda Galaxy, who gets transported to Earth by accident. * In the 1968 Star Trek episode \\"By Any Other Name\\", the starship Enterprise is hijacked by Kelvans, aliens from an empire spanning the Andromeda Galaxy; their home galaxy was approaching an uninhabitable state and thus they aimed to conquer our own.

PokƒÅn episode \\"The Spell of Dreams is Magic That Lasts One Day,\\" Aiko has Uma use the magical Happy Chalk to draw a galactic train that could take them to the Andromeda Galaxy as one of Aiko's attempts to gain a human body since she has heard about something like this happening there before. Uma draws up the galactic train and they end up riding it to the Andromeda Galaxy even getting there faster when Uma drew a turbo boose enough for a trip due to the effects of the Happy Chalk lasting until the end of the day's first use. Upon landing on a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy, Uma, Pachira, Liru, and Aiko head to the area near Andromeda Tanashi where a robot would gain a real body or vice versa. It turns out that it takes a full day in order for the body changing to occur. The princesses leave and Aiko now knows that what she heard about the Andromeda Galaxy was true all along. * The Guardians of the Galaxy films take place primarily in the Andromeda Galaxy. * In Ben 10: Ultimate Alien, the overall plot of the first season is stopping the Osmosian warlord Aggregor from gaining the powers of 5 aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy: Bivalvan, a hydrokinetic molluscan humanoid; Galapagus, a peaceful aerokinetic turtle; P'andor, an armored energy being constantly unleashing radiation and heat; Andreas, an armadillo-like being with the ability to cause earthquakes and tunnel through the ground rapidly; and Ra'ad, a jellyfish-like being with high power in controlling electricity.

The plot involves an invasion of the Milky Way Galaxy and Terran Federation by aliens from Andromeda. The Big Finish Productions audio drama, Warship takes place between the two seasons. =Games= * In the Star Fleet Universe games, the Andromedans (who may or may not have been Kelvans; see Star Trek above) launch a devastating war on the Milky Way, using the Lesser Magellanic Cloud as a stepping-stone. * In the Sega video game series Phantasy Star, the instruction booklet of the first game states that the Algol Solar System is located deep in the Andromeda Galaxy (while the real Algol is only about 90 light years away from us). * In Star Trek Online, the alien race known as the Iconians are revealed to have a Gateway network and a Dyson Sphere in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is where they have been hiding since fleeing their homeworld in the Milky Way. Once their invasion of the Milky Way begins, the sphere teleports itself there. * In Ben 10 Ultimate Alien: Cosmic Destruction, the five Andromeda aliens (listed above) are playable forms for Ben as Water Hazard, Terraspin, NRG, Armodrillo, and AmpFibian. * In the Space Quest series, there are recurring characters, who are the alter egos of the creators, called the Two Guys from Andromeda. * In Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, the Andromeda Galaxy is referenced when a message regarding the \\"closing\\" of the Milky Way Galaxy server is issued to all Eternal Sphere players.

The game is a spin-off of the original Mass Effect trilogy, set 600 years following the events of Mass Effect 2. In the game, each race participating in the initiative sends a large ship, called an Ark, on a 600-year voyage to Andromeda. Each ship contains the races' best and brightest volunteers, suspended in cryosleep. The player takes control of one of the customizable Ryder twins and becomes the \\"Pathfinder\\", responsible for making decisions in how the humans will settle the new galaxy, and how humanity will help find the other races' missing arks. =Music= * The Andromeda galaxy has also featured heavily in the central theme of Enigma's sixth album A Posteriori, in which a collision involving the Milky Way is prophesied to occur in the distant future. The most explicit reference to this appears at the album's close with a doom-laden yet mysterious statement, suggesting a collision of the galaxies will give rise to a \\"new, gigantic cosmic world\\" being born. * M31 appears in the song \\"Out of the White Hole\\" of the album Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator by Ayreon. * In the story of the ship named Iron Savior, as told by the band Iron Savior, in the Andromeda Galaxy there is a region of space called the Realm Of Steel, with a Machine World at its center. Both the Realm Of Steel and the Machine World are feared by the rest of the galaxy. *\\"Andromeda\\" is the title of the first released single from the 2019 album Titanic Rising by American musician Weyes Blood. Large Magellanic Cloud * In the comedy film My Stepmother Is an Alien (1988), the Clouds of Megallan is a galaxy 92 light-years from Earth, and the home world of the alien Celeste Martin. * In Olaf Stapledon's 1937 science fiction novel Star Maker, there is a group of aliens that live in the Large Magellanic Cloud called the Symbiotics, a super-intelligent symbiotic race composed of telepathically linked arachnoid beings and whale-like ichthyoid beings. The \\"Symbiotics\\" are the most advanced intelligent life in the Milky Way Galaxy and its satellite galaxies. The reason is because they combine the manipulative tool-using intelligence of the arachnoids with the contemplative meditative and mathematical intelligence of the ichthyoids. The \\"Symbiotics\\" travel in starships equipped with tanks of water for the ichthyoids and piloted by the arachnoids. They conduct vast terraforming projects, terraforming planets in numerous different planetary systems. They also construct large artificial planetoids, hollow spheres filled with water inhabited on the inside by the icthyoids and on the surface by the arachnoids. They have the most advanced and powerful telepathic powers of any race in our galaxy and its satellites and are thus able to stop the War of Galactic Empires within the Milky Way Galaxy by telepathically attacking the military forces of the various Galactic Empires and causing them to have doubts about imperialism. This causes the various Imperial military forces to become totally disorganized. The Galaxy is led into a new era of galactic peace supervised by the democratic and communistic Galactic Community of Worlds, which emerges after the fall of the Galactic Empires. The Large Magellanic Cloud * The Large Magellanic Cloud is the destination of the spacecraft Yamato in the first season of the 1970s anime series Space Battleship Yamato (known as Space Cruiser Yamato or Star Blazers to Western audiences). The LMC is the host galaxy for the destination, Iscandar, and the home planet of the alien force attacking Earth, Gamilas. The Yamato must use an untested faster-than- light drive to make the 296,000 light year round trip in one Earth year. (Note: in the 1974 original, the one-way distance was given as 148,000 LY; in the reimagined Space Battleship Yamato 2199, this is corrected to 168,000 LY to reflect more-recent measurements.) * In Scientology, these are said to be literal clouds. They are involved in the fictional story of Helatrobus. * In Marvel Comics, the Large Magellanic Cloud is home to the Kree empireSilver Surfer Vol. 3 #4 (October, 1987) but its territory may extend into other galaxies. * In Arthur C Clarke's novel Rendezvous with Rama, the giant spaceship Rama is at the end directed towards the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its journey through the solar system was apparently just to use the Sun to refuel and as a gravitational slingshot. * In The Forever War, a 1974 science fiction novel by Joe Haldeman, a significant battle takes place on a 'collapsar' portal planet in the Large Magellanic Cloud. * In James Blish's series Cities in Flight, hero John Amalfi and the New Earth planet escape to the Greater Magellenic Cloud to avoid unjust prosecution for an atrocity. * In the Robert Silverberg novel Collision Course, a wayward space ship trying to fly back to Earth gets lost in \\"null-space\\" and ends up emerging into normal space within the Large Magellanic Cloud; the captain suggests they find a permanent home there as their chances of getting home are extremely remote and they are fortunate to have dropped into normal space within a galaxy. Ultimately, they are returned to the Milky Way by sympathetic, superior aliens. The Milky Way galaxy is easily visible, evoking a feeling of loneliness and separation when the crew realize they're looking at their home galaxy. * In the game Infinite Space, the main character flees to the Large Magellanic Cloud after the civilizations of the Small Magellanic Cloud are taken over by an invading empire. Most of the second half of the game is spent in this galaxy. * In the Deadlands: Lost Colony roleplaying game, the Faraway system is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. * In Halo, the parasitic Flood was said to have come from Large Magellanic Cloud on ancient cargo ships. In the novel Halo: Silentium, Forerunners (who called it \\"Path Kethona\\") were revealed to have chased the surviving Precursors to the Magellanic Cloud during a Forerunner war and ruthlessly killed off nearly the entire species. The Forerunners that committed this act were ashamed and lived the rest of their lives on a planet in the Magellanic Cloud. * In the soundtrack of the game Starbound, there is a song titled \\"Large Magellanic Cloud\\". * In The Mixed Men fix-up by A. E. van Vogt, the culture clash between imperial Earth and the local colonies propelling the plot happens in the Large Magellanic Cloud. * In Beyond the Aquila Rift by Alastair Reynolds a faster than light travel accident sends the protagonist not merely beyond the titular \\"Aquila Rift\\" (~400 light years off course), but to the Large Magellanic Cloud (~150,000 light years off course). Dealing with the reality that hundreds of years have passed outside of FTL travel (and that they have no way to send him home) is a key point of the story. * In The Magellanic Journey, a 2019 science fiction novella by Eder Nogueira, a crew of space pirates led by a former scientist discovers a secret wormhole on Mercury that leads to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Travelling through several planetary systems in the galaxy, the crew encounters some extraterrestrial creatures, including a primitive sapient species that worships the Milky Way, and the remnants of an extinct galactic empire. * In Gateway, a novel by Frederik Pohl, distances on long interstellar journeys can be measured by imaging the Magellanic Clouds, as the rotation allows for the distance from them to be measured. Small Magellanic Cloud In the nearby galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud, a massive star has exploded as a supernova, and begun to dissipate its interior into a spectacular display of colorful filaments. * The Small Magellanic Cloud is the site of the climax of Robert A. Heinlein's novel Have Space Suit‚ÄîWill Travel, in which the spectacular view of the Milky Way is admired. * In two Star Trek books from Pocket Books ‚Äì The Lost Era: The Sundered and Titan: The Red King, the Small Magellanic Cloud is home to the Neyel, an offshoot of humanity who dominated several species native to the Cloud. * The Small Magellanic Cloud is the location of an Alderson disk onto which the surface of Cold War-era Earth is transplanted in Charles Stross's short story \\"Missile Gap.\\" * In the Star Fleet Universe, the Small Magellanic Cloud (referred to in that setting as the Lesser Magellanic Cloud) is home to a number of starfaring empires; such as the Baduvai Imperium, the Eneen Protectorates and the Maghadim Hives. All of these empires were conquered by the Andromedans, who then used the Cloud as a jumping off point into the Milky Way. The Cloud was eventually liberated from Andromedan rule in Operation Unity; a coalition of task forces sent by the Federation, Klingons and other Alpha Octant powers.Magellanic History (ADB, 2006) * Iain M. Banks' novel The Player of Games is partially set in the Empire of Azad in the Small Magellanic Cloud. * In Dan Simmons' Hyperion series, the planet Earth is thought swallowed up by a black hole but is actually transported to somewhere within the Lesser Magellanic Cloud. * In Edmond Hamilton's Star Kings series, a race of powerful telepaths called H'Harn originated in the Small Magellanic Cloud and has made two attempts to conquer the Milky Way Galaxy. * Salo, the space traveler stranded on Titan in Kurt Vonnegut's The Sirens of Titan, hails from the fictional planet Tralfamadore, located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. M33 ('Triangulum Galaxy') Picture of the Triangulum Galaxy. * In the novel Voyage of the Space Beagle by A.E. Van Vogt, the starship Space Beagle is sent out by Earth to investigate alien life forms. When it reaches the M33 galaxy in Triangulum, it encounters an enormous disembodied life form called The Anabis that covers the entire galaxy. \\"The Anabis\\" turns planets into jungle planets because it lives off the life force of living beings when they die and jungle planets have the highest rate of ecological energetics. Since \\"The Anabis\\" has destroyed civilized planets in this way, the crew of the starship devises a way to defeat this being. * In the fictional Star Trek universe, the Triangulum Galaxy is where the USS Enterprise-D is warped to after a being known as The Traveler uses his knowledge to influence the ship's warp drive. M33 is said to be approximately 2.7 million light years away from the United Federation of Planets territories, or about three hundred years' travel time for the Federation's most advanced vessels. The galaxy was first encountered in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Where No One Has Gone Before\\". * In the Star Fleet Universe, the Triangulum Galaxy was once dominated by a now-defunct precursor empire; the civil war, which tore the Old Empire asunder, left two major successor states (the loyalist Imperium and the rebel Frigian Kingdom) picking up the pieces. Another elder species, the Helgardians, appeared in M33 at the same time; in the modern era, an array of younger powers (such as the Mallaran Empire) would emerge on the back of Helgardian-traded warp technology.Timeline of the Triangulum Galaxy, Star Fleet Battles Module E2, (ADB, 2001) * The second season finale of seaQuest DSV featured the seaQuest being transported to the planet Hyperion, over eleven million light years away from Earth in the Triangulum Galaxy. * On Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda the Systems Commonwealth had territory in the Triangulum Galaxy in addition to the Andromeda and Milky Way Galaxies. The new homeworld of which, Tarazed, was located in this Galaxy. * In the Belgian comic book series Yoko Tsuno written by Roger Leloup, M33 is the home of the blue-skinned Vineans, whom the main characters befriend. About a third of the stories take place in this galaxy. * In the Orion's Arm universe, the Triangulum galaxy is home to an extra-galactic civilization, having sent a powerful warning message about a massive artificial object heading towards the local group several million years ago. * In the 2004 Iain M. Banks novel The Algebraist, the Triangulum Nebula was the starting point of the Long Crossing, a 30-million-year journey undertaken by the Dweller civilization to return to the world of Nasqueron where much of the novel is set. * In the Crysis video game series, the alien antagonists, named the \\"Ceph\\", originate from this galaxy. * The 2000 computer game Gunman Chronicles takes place in M33, where humanity has established multiple colonies and has the ability to trigger supernovae. * In March 2012 the news satire website The Onion reported that a fleet of warships from the planet Zarklan 12 in the Triangulum Galaxy has arrived at Earth to intervene in the Syrian War on the side of the Syrian rebel alliance. \\"Supreme Emperor and Dynastic Overlord Thuu'l\\", the Onion reported, is disturbed by Earth's apathy toward the massacres of innocent Syrians. * The promotional posters for the movie E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial give the phrase \\"three million lightyears from home\\", leading many to believe that the title character hails from M33. Furthermore, the Easter egg of E.T.'s race appearing in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace have many Star Wars fans pointing to M33 as the \\"galaxy far, far away\\". * In the 2016 Al DesHotel novel 235, The Triangulum Galaxy was a destination for exploration by the Alaytion Empire by the Emperor Kaajii Morrell.

M51 ('Whirlpool Galaxy') * The Whirlpool Galaxy or M51 was used as the basis for the galaxy in which the story of the Homeworld series of games takes place. The original Homeworld game takes the player on a journey from the galaxy's outer rim to its core; this is accurately illustrated by the background images as the game campaign progresses. * The Whirlpool Galaxy appears in the video game ≈åkami, where it is summoned by the main character, Amaterasu, to create a whirlpool in the ocean that she uses to travel to an aquatic palace. *The three teenage alien protagonists of the Roswell (TV series)‚Äîitself a spin-off of the Roswell High novels‚Äîare said to come from the Five Worlds of the Whirlwind Galaxy. * The Whirlpool Galaxy or M51 appears in the novels The Genesis Quest and Second Genesis by Donald Moffitt. In the novels, future humans beam the sum of human knowledge towards the Virgo supercluster, which is received and understood by aliens in the intervening M51 galaxy. The information, 37 million years after transmission, is used for the aliens to reconstruct mankind long after they ceased to exist in the Milky Way galaxy. *The M51 Galaxy is mentioned in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers as the home of Master Vile, the father of Rita Repulsa. M81 * In the fictional Star Fleet Universe, M81 is the home galaxy for a number of star-faring species, including the Tholians (who conquered that galaxy and ruled it for many centuries), the Nebuline (one of the Tholians' former enemies, whose remaining nebula-bound colonies laid the groundwork for M81 piracy.Pirates of M81 Galaxy, Captain's Log #41, (ADB, 2010)), the Seltorians (the last of a series of enforcer species for the Tholians; their Revolt virtually exterminated the Tholians as a people, and their subsequent Tribunal fleets pursued exiled Tholians to other galaxies, such as the Milky Way), and the Bolosco (some of whom established themselves in the Omega Octant of the Milky Way). M83 * The French synthpop band M83 is named after this galaxy. * The band Clutch makes reference to M83 in their song Spacegrass off their self-titled album. > \\"Hey kid, are you going my way? > Hop in, we'll have ourselves a field day. > We'll find us some spacegrass, > Lay low, watch the universe expand. > Skyway, permanent Saturday. > Oh, by the way, Saturn is my rotary. > Hop in, it'll be eternity > Till we make it to M83.\\" M86 * In the TV show Andromeda, M86 is cited as being the origin of the Magog invasion of the three galaxies in the season 2 opener \\"The Widening Gyre\\". Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte Galaxy * Part of the Lensman series by E. E. Smith takes place in Lundmark's Nebula. This is a clear reference to astronomer Knut Lundmark whose particular area of specialization was the study of galaxies, and may refer to the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte Galaxy. p. 66, p. 121. ‚Äî albeit this hypothesis would be contradicted by the series establishing material stating that \\"Lundmark's Nebula\\" and the Milky Way Galaxy collided \\"edge-on\\" during the \\"planet-forming era, as well as by stated discrepancies in the books regarding distances and structures compared to the real Wolf- Lundmark-Melotte.\\" *The Doctor Who novel Synthespians‚Ñ¢ by Craig Hinton refers to the New Earth Republic of the 101st Century and beyond, which spearheads a programme of colonisation, sending sleeper ships to the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte galaxy and Andromeda.http://www.whoniverse.net/discontinuity/pd66 Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy * Doctor Who novel The Eyeless is set in this Galaxy, which is referred to as the Seventh Galaxy. In other stories the Seventh Galaxy is mentioned as the location of Skaro, home planet of the Daleks. Other galaxies Fictional galaxies * Murray Leinster's novel The Last Spaceship has escapees from our galaxy founding a new civilization in a remote galaxy. * The Stargate movie and television series feature several fictional galaxies, including the Kaliem galaxy (a vague reference to the constellation Caelum, perhaps), in which the planet Abydos is located in the film (this was later retconned to be in the Milky Way), and the Ida galaxy, home of the Asgard alien species. The Ori in Stargate SG-1 come from another unnamed galaxy that's in a different supercluster of Galaxies, and use the Supergate to travel to the Milky Way galaxy. *In Marvel Comics, the Shi'ar Imperium is within a region referred to as the \\"Shi'ar Galaxy\\" and is controlled by the Shi'ar race. As this region is said to be situated close to the Skrull and Kree Empires mentioned above, and is one of the three main alien empires of the Marvel Universe, the home of the Shi'ar empire may actually be the Triangulum Galaxy or one of the many dwarf galaxies within the Local Group. The Black Galaxy is the home of Ego the Living Planet. *Star Wars is set \\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\\". *In the Superman film series, Krypton is said to be located in the \\"Xeno Galaxy\\". *In the Doctor Who series, the Face of Boe is said to be the oldest living inhabitant of the Isop galaxy. The insectoid inhabitants of the planet Vortis were also from the Isop galaxy. Representatives of the six \\"Outer Galaxies\\" meet in The Daleks' Master Plan. *In Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy, Terra Venture and the Lost Galaxy Rangers travel to the 'Lost Galaxy', a galaxy that seems to exist outside our dimension and which can only be reached by portal. After many adventures in this galaxy Terra Venture and the Rangers escape the Lost Galaxy through a portal opened by reciting the Lost Galaxy Spell backwards. * In the book Skylark of Valeron (part of the Skylark of Space series by E. E. Smith), the protagonists visit another galaxy after being rotated through the fourth dimension and visit a number of different galaxies in the last book in the series, Skylark DuQuesne. * The finale of the 2007 anime series Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann features the titular mecha as being larger than a galaxy, and capable of wielding small galaxies as deadly projectiles. * In the Mel Brooks film Spaceballs Captain Lone Starr hails from the 'Ford' galaxy, in reference both to Harrison Ford and the automobile Ford Galaxie. * Insomniac Games' popular video game franchise 'Ratchet & Clank' features three fictional galaxies called the Solana Galaxy, the Bogon Galaxy, and the Polaris Galaxy. * In the 1956 book Islands of Space (part of the Arcot, Wade, and Morey stories by John W. Campbell) the protagonists are lost in space and ask the astronomers of a planet in another galaxy to help them find the Milky Way by looking for a spiral galaxy with two small satellite galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. *In Episode 1.21 of The Outer Limits, \\"The Children of Spider County,\\" the alien/human hybrids are said to be from the Krell Galaxy (an allusion to the fictional extinct extraterrestrial race, native to Altair IV, in the s.f. film classic Forbidden Planet). * In Space Battleship Yamato (also known as Star Blazers), the final major battle before reaching Gamilas/Iscandar is said to occur in what the characters call \\"The Rainbow Galaxy\\". However, onscreen, this looked more like a group of planetary masses than an actual galaxy. Presumably, the name comes from the different color of the different planets. This designation was only used in the English language Star Blazers. In the original Japanese Yamato, it was properly called the Rainbow System. * In the lore of space MMORPG EVE Online humanity has colonized a distant galaxy named \\"New Eden\\", where the game takes place. * Dimension X in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles stories is in some TMNT versions thought to be a galaxy.

McDonald taught briefly at St. Dunstan's College and was a pastor in Kings County for nine years. Later, McDonald would be named Rector of St. Dunstan's, a position he held for seven years. In 1891, following the death of Bishop Peter McIntyre, McDonald was immediately appointed Bishop, after serving as Coadjutor bishop since 1890. Bishop McDonald's tenure was seen as a period of growth for the Diocese of Charlottetown. Many new churches were built throughout Prince Edward Island, St. Dunstan's College became affiliated with Universit√© Laval in Quebec City in 1892, and the Notre-Dame Convent for Girls flourished. In 1896, construction began on the new St. Dunstan's Basilica (the one before the present basilica that stands today). The new basilica was built out of stone and considered one of the most magnificent churches east of Quebec. In 1908, after many years of service, McDonald's health began to fail, and he was left an invalid. At this time, Father James Morrison, Vicar General of the Diocese, stepped in to take care of diocesan administration. Bishop McDonald finally succumbed to his ill health and died at his Charlottetown residence in 1912. His funeral took place at St. Dunstan's Basilica and his remains were interred in his native home of St. Andrew's.

It is not known how Bruna received his musical training, but in 1631 he was appointed organist of the collegiate church of St. Mar√≠a in his hometown of Daroca, later rising to choirmaster in 1674. He remained there until his death in 1679. Thirty-two of Bruna's organ works have survived, mostly in the tiento form. Many, known as tientos de medio registro, are for divided keyboard, a typical feature of Spanish organs.

In addition, she recorded frequently with her son Pery Ribeiro, from her marriage with composer Herivelto Martins. She died as a victim of internal bleeding, probably caused by cancer. Life and career Dalva de Oliveira in TV¬¥s program Discoteca do Chacrinha, 1965. Dalva was born in Rio Claro, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Her father was a carpenter and semi-professional musician, playing clarinet and saxophone with a group called Os Oito Batutas (the Eight Batons). He died when Dalva was just eight years old, and, as a result, Dalva and her three sisters were placed into an orphanage, where Dalva remained for three years. At the orphanage, Dalva learned to play piano and organ, as well as choral singing. Dalva left the orphanage due to an illness, and went to live with her mother in the city of S√£o Paulo. In 1933, while still a teenager, Dalva began working as a singer, touring (together with her mother) with a group led by Ant√¥nio Zovetti. Thereafter, Dalva spent a year as a regularly featured singer on R√°dio Mineira in the state of Minas Gerais. Hoping to achieve success on a larger stage, Dalva and her mother moved to Rio de Janeiro. At first, Dalva had to work in a factory, while her mother worked as a cleaning woman. In 1936, however, she was hired by R√°dio Mayrink Veiga, the most powerful broadcaster in Rio at that time. Dalva began working with Herivelto Martins and Francisco Sena, whose singing duo Preto e Branco (Black and White) was already popular. In 1936, Dalva and Herivelto married. The three renamed the group Trio de Ouro (Golden Trio). The trio performed and recorded together until 1948. In 1949, Dalva separated from Herivelto. The couple's separation and divorce was prolonged, bitter, and public. Their dispute and mutual accusations were featured not only in press coverage, but in the lyrics of songs recorded by each of them. When she left Herivelto, one part of the public viewed Dalva as a fallen woman; another part, as a rebel and hero. Dalva was quoted as saying: \\"I had everything: a home, husband, children, career, and I left that security in order to gain my freedom, to regain myself as a woman.\\" Author Maria Hupfer wrote of her: \\"Dalva became the idol of the prostitutes, mistresses, and homosexuals, and was excoriated by housewives and family men.\\" Selected filmography * Berlin to the Samba Beat (1944) * Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film) (Brazilian dubbing) Snow White Speaking (1938) * Pinocchio (1940 film) (Brazilian dubbing) The Blue Fairy (1940) * Fun and Fancy Free (Brazilian dubbing) Singing Harp (1947)  See also  * Dalva e Herivelto: uma Can√ß√£o de Amor References External links * Dalva¬¥s Biography at Collectors * Category:1917 births Category:1972 deaths Category:People from Rio Claro, S√£o Paulo Category:Brazilian contraltos Category:Brazilian female singers Category:20th- century Brazilian singers Category:20th-century women singers Category:Deaths from bleeding ","title":"Dalva de Oliveira"},{"id":"8004836","text":"Location of Hajd√∫-Bihar county in Hungary G√∂rbeh√°za is a village in Hajd√∫- Bihar county, in the Northern Great Plain region of eastern Hungary.

It is native to Madagascar and naturalised in Mauritius and the Seychelles. Description The trunk features aerial prop roots.\\"Screw pine.\\" ¬© Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. Retrieved on 2009-04-27. The leaves are linear and spiny, with a spiral arrangement on the tree. The leaves are also dried out and rolled, and used to make mats in Kerala, India; and Hawaii. Care must be taken when handling the leaves because of their sharp spines. The fruit of Pandanus utilis is edible, although not flavorful to humans and must be cooked prior to consumption. It attracts mammals such as, in North America, squirrels.  Introduction  Within the family Pandanaceae, the genus Pandanus is thought to compose the largest group of plants.M. H. Zimmerman, et al., \\"Vascular Construction and Development in the Stems of Certain Pandanaceae,\\" Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 68:1 (January 1974): 21-41 It is estimated that there are somewhere between 500 and 1,000 species within this genus. Pandanus utilis (pan-DAY-nus YOO-tih- liss), otherwise known as the common screwpine, is one such plant within this family. The origin of P. utilis has traditionally been thought to be Madagascar, but more recently the Mascarene Islands have been suggested as a possible place of origin. A long history of cultivation and transport to many parts of the world makes the origin difficult to trace. However, it is known to be grown in Senegal, Benin, Tanzania, Madagascar, R√©union, Maldives and Mauritius. P. utilis has been introduced to many tropical and subtropical regions, including Central America, the Caribbean, the United States (southern Florida, Puerto Rico), Brazil, India, and Indonesia. Pandanus utilis was discovered by French naturalist Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent. Although they were given a common name of pine, they are monocots, more closely related to grasses, orchids and palms than to conifer trees such as pines. Their name is derived from the spiral arrangement of their leaves around the branches.  Morphology  Pandanus utilis is a palm-like evergreen tree, ranging in height up to . They are found in tropical areas and have an upright trunk that is smooth with many horizontal spreading branches with annular leaf scars. Old leaf scars spiral around the branches and trunk, like a screw. The anatomy of Pandanaceae stems can be distinguished from other monocotyledons by the presence of a compound vascular bundle. This bi- or tripolar vascular bundle has two or three distinct conduction strands encased by a common bundle sheath. At the end of each branch is a spiral cluster of long, linear leaves with a pectinate (comb-like) edge tapering to a long point at the apex. This margin is filled with small reddish colored teeth. The leaves are simple without lobes and can be up to long and broad. They are without petioles and are broadly clasped at the base. The leaf venation is parallel running longitudinal. The blue/green to dark green leaves is rather stiff with a waxy texture. The leaves of P. utilis have a spongy tissue with numerous fibers arranged in bundles. These bundles can contain over 150 fibers. As with other member of the genus Pandanus, P. utilis lacks secondary growth. The secondary growth of most trees is the production of wood to aid in support of the trunk. Without this supportive structure, the P. utilis grows many pale brown prop roots at the base of the trunk. These adventitious roots arise from the stem above the soil level and help support the plant. These roots not only anchor the tree but also keep it upright during times of heavy winds and rain in tropical regions. Prop roots can be in diameter. P. utilis is dioecious, with the female and male reproducing structures occurring on different plants. Individual plants are either male producing microspores or female producing megaspores. This plant being unisexual allows it to cross-fertilize with other screwpines. The male plants produce fragrant colorful flowers in long spikes. These long spikes are with 8‚Äì12 stamens inserted pseudo-umbellately on slender columns long. The female plants produce fruits resembling pineapples or oversized pine cones changing from green to yellow/orange when ripe. The female structure has a 3‚Äì8 celled ovary crowned by a sessile stigma. This species is naturalised in several of the Mascarene islands, where it coexists with a great number of other indigenous and endemic Pandanus species. It can usually be distinguished from these however, by the tip of the free portion of each drupe of its fruit-head, which usually does not have an areole. The tip is usually also cleft between the stigmas. The fruit-heads are very variable, but usually stand out by being up to 20 cm wide and containing 100-200 drupes.  Ecology  P. utilis grows well near the sea, being salt-tolerant. It is a strictly tropical tree that will not survive frost. It grows in full sun to partial shade but prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight. Seeds take two to three months to germinate.  Use and Management The screw pine has been shown to have many uses. In coastal areas, it has been used for erosion control due to its numerous aerial roots. These roots help bind the sand dunes along the coast from eroding water and wind. The leaves of P. utilis are used in different cultures for thatching and the production of numerous materials. In areas like Madagascar, R√©union and Mauritius, the leaves are used to make ropes, baskets, mats, hats, place mats, nets, thatched roofs for homes and even paper. The waxy covering over the leaves makes them especially attractive for baskets and roofs with their natural water-resistant surface. The fruits form a starchy food and can be eaten after being cooked.  Chemical Composition  Pandalisines A and B are two novel indolizidine alkaloids from this plant.  Pests and Diseases  Few diseases have been recorded on members of the Pandanaceae within Papua New Guinea or worldwide. With the exception of a single suspected virus disease causing yellow mottling on the leaves and an MLO disease causing decline in P. utilis in Florida all diseases recorded on Pandanus have been caused by fungal pathogens.D.L.

The film celebrates the 1920s French Foreign Legion. Foreign Legion Major Foster (Hackman), a war-weary American haunted by his memories of the recently ended Great War, is assigned to protect a group of archaeologists at a dig site in Erfoud in Morocco from Bedouin revolutionaries led by El-Krim (based on Moroccan revolutionary Abd el-Krim). The song \\"Plaisir d'amour\\", a tune about lost love and regret, is heard repeatedly through the film, serving as the film's theme song.  Plot  Soon after the Great War, Major Foster (Gene Hackman), the commander of a detachment of the French Foreign Legion, suffers the haunting memories of leading an army of 8,000, now reduced to 200. He has become an alcoholic as a result, and his only friend is his faithful Sergeant, Triand (Rufus). Foster arrives in Paris to assume a new command: to return to the Rif (Morocco) to re-establish French authority, as the Bedouin and Berber tribes have begun to revolt against French rule. Foster is also ordered to escort archaeologists from the Louvre, who are uncovering an ancient city near Erfoud, buried by a sand storm 3,000 years ago. The site is the final resting place of a Berber saint, \\"The Angel of the Desert\\". Foster was chosen for the assignment, as he is the only French officer alive who served in Morocco before the war. He had helped to develop diplomatic ties with the tribes, especially with El Krim (Ian Holm), the de facto leader of the scattered Rif tribes. Foster had vowed to El Krim that there would be no further archeological excavations. Foster's force is assembled. Among those who volunteer, willingly or unwillingly, is \\"the Gypsy\\" Marco Segrain (Terence Hill), a charming jewel thief famous for a three-year crime spree on the Riviera until French authorities managed to apprehend him. Gypsy befriends three other recruits: the Russian giant Ivan (Jack O'Halloran), formerly a member of the elite bodyguard of the deposed Russian Imperial family; \\"Top Hat\\" Gilbert Francis (Andr√© Penvern), a fashionable man and musician who lacks the physical traits needed in a soldier; and Fredrick Hastings (Paul Sherman), a romantic young English aristocrat who missed the Great War. The four friends are soon disillusioned by the harsh realities of life in the Legion. A fatal fight breaks out among the men while traveling to Morocco over an insult to Maj. Foster's honor, to which Sgt. Triand takes exception. Foster does not hesitate to harshly discipline his men, especially Marco, who frequently disobeys orders, though he does care for his legionaries. During the voyage, Marco charms Mme. Picard (Catherine Deneuve), daughter of a murdered archaeologist. During their land journey to the Legion fortress, the train carrying the Legionnaires and the archaeological team is stopped by El Krim and his men. El Krim greets his old friend Foster but also declares that he is determined to unite the Berber tribes to drive the French out of Morocco. El Krim gives a \\"gift\\" to Foster to take back to the Premier of France: the archeologists of an earlier dig, who have been blinded and whose tongues have been cut out. He warns Foster not to continue with the excavation. Training in the desert is so harsh, it pushes Top Hat to commit suicide. Later, at the digging site, Hastings is kidnapped while on guard duty and tortured to death by one of El Krim's men, whom El Krim excuses as being merely over-zealous. Marco retaliates. Instead of disciplining him, Foster merely defends him, using El Krim's previous excuse for the actions of his own man. Eventually, the tomb of the Angel of the Desert is found, and her golden sarcophagus is excavated. Foster offers it to El Krim as a token of peace, but El Krim rallies the warriors of the Bedouin tribes to fight a climactic battle. With the Legionnaires being heavily outnumbered, the digging site is eventually overrun. Ivan is killed, but Marco fights on, single-handedly fending off a flank attack. When Foster is killed, El Krim immediately calls off the fight, sending the surviving Legionnaires \\"to tell the world what happened\\" and out of respect for his dead friend. There are two endings: the TV version ends with Marco taking up Mme Picard's offer to desert. The theatrical ending shows Marco (after having been promoted for his bravery in battle) staying behind and training more Legionnaire recruits, welcoming them by reiterating Foster's warning: \\"If the Legion doesn't get you, the desert will. If the desert doesn't, the Arabs will. And if the Arabs don't, then I will. I don't know which is worse.\\" =Additional scenes= In the TV version, there were several scenes that were not included in the theatrical or in the video/DVD versions of the film. One pivotal extra scene occurs when the excavation work has commenced and it is discovered that two of the Legionaries, both of them German recruits, have deserted. The sadistic second-in-command of the company, Lt Fontaine and his equally vicious crony the Corporal lead a patrol to capture them. They catch up with the two Germans and Fontaine orders the patrol to shoot them. The noise attracts a large group of Bedouin tribesmen and, disregarding the warnings from his men, Fontaine orders his men to open fire, igniting a battle. The Corporal is shot dead and Fontaine breaks down in fear and kills himself. Marco displays his courage and natural flair for leadership by rallying the survivors of the patrol and successfully beating off the attackers. In the video release, this scene was omitted but brief shots of Fontaine and the Corporal were taken from this scene and edited into the climactic battle at the digging site so it appears that both men died there instead.

Most of the finance was provided by Lew Grade's ITC Company on the basis of Terence Hill's popularity. It was Hill's second film aimed at the American market. Filming started 23 August 1976. It was mostly shot in Spain. Gene Hackman was injured during filming after he was thrown off a horse. This caused filming to be suspended.author=Columbia only agreed to distribute in the US because they wanted to distribute Grade's The Eagle Has Landed. In most markets, March played theatres in a double-bill with Eagle.

It falls in the Kottayam district of India, the city of letters. It is a densely populated place of Kaduthuruthy Gram Panchayat. The population is around 3,500, in an area about two square kilometers. It is a twin \\"thuruthu\\" comprising the main land Ezhumanthuruthu and another small thuruthu called Pulithuruthu. The adjoining place to the east is the famous Ayamkudy and to the west is the popular water-logged place of upper Kuttanad known as \\"Mundar estate\\". The populace of Ezhumanthuruthu is 90% agriculture labourers and small or medium farmers. One can reach Ezhumanthuruthu straight from nearby town Thalayolaparambu by road of 5 km or from Kaduthuruthy town. The nearest railway station is Kaduthuruthy railway station. It is about 6 km away from this place. Long ago, it was surrounded by rivers. Now any one can access through road. Mythology Ezhumanthuruthu has a well-known history of its origin. During the 18-19th century due to Tipu Sultan's invasion of Malabar area, Brahmins of Palaghat and their soldiers eloped towards south. On their route, some families settled at this small place. One of the Namboothiripad was believed to have divine powers. He used to bathe early morning in nearby river. One day a mango tree fell down on his route causing obstacle to his way. He murmured three times \\"Ezhumave\\". \\"Ezhu\\" means stand up and \\"mave\\" means mango tree in Malayalam. After this incident the mango tree stood up and cleared the way for the Namboothiripad. Thereafter, the place was known as Ezhumanthuruthu and the house of the Namboothiripad as Ezhumavil Mana. Correct meaning of \\"Ezhu\\" is seven, hence Ezhumanthuruthu means island of seven mango trees. The former one is someone's belief only. In legend it was said that the Pandavas travelled through this place during their twelve years' \\"ajnathavasam\\". There said to be lies a stone bridge beneath the north side Kariyar river which they constructed for crossing the river. The architects of Ezhumanthuruthu The present day developments, enjoyed by the people of this place is the result of hard work of Sri. Godan Namboodiripad, popularly known as Godan thirumeni. He contributed land to build up the only one upper primary school. When all the LP Schools lost 5th standard, Ezhumanthuruthu LPS retained it because of this Thirumeni. His efforts were immense to develop the school. Due to his hard work and timely intervention, a public telephone booth was commissioned after dragging the over head line of 4 km line which was very difficult to get sanction from the authorities during that period. A post box was also brought into Ezhumanthuruthu and hang on the wall of the then LP School in 1960s. He was instrumental for the progress of this small island. He died on 2 January 2007 at his elder son Babu's residence at Ahmedabad when he was 85 years old. Public places There are a U.P. School, a branch of co-operative Bank, a co-operative milk society, Netaji Smaraka Gramina Grandhasala public library and a post office (B.O). Government U.P. School This school is established in 1918(?)Education department record shows that the school was officially affiliated in 1921 by Mr. Baker, a British national to provide basic and elementary education to the village folk. There was no connectivity with other places. The land was surrounded with water hence small kids can't go for their schooling. In the beginning of the 20th century, the place was surrounded by Kariyar, Kalathode and Mathankari river. This place was an island (thuruthu in Malayalam), hence an isolated place; travelling to other places was very difficult. Primary and basic education was not accessible to the poor downtrodden folk. Untouchability prevailed then. There was a foreign landlord (Mr. Baker) lived in the place looking after the now turned \\"surplus land\\" (michabhoomi) alias \\"sayippin kari\\". He built a single shed school for providing primary education. After independence from the Travancore Rajas and British Raj, The school had been taken over by the government of Kerala and classes were run up to 5th standard in a newly constructed building near to the old building. The land had been donated by a generous man popularly known as Parackal Pappu. He died in 1998. Thereafter in the 1970s there was a popular demand to upgrade the school to Upper primary i.e. up to 7th standard, again shortage of land was an issue. Sri. Godan Namboothirippad donated some land and the upgradation committee of the school purchased the rest to fulfill the need. In the \\"People's Plan\\" project, a new block has been built. The school celebrated its 90th anniversary. Now it is planning for celebrating the century colourfully. Many former students of this school had been reached great heights in their life. Now a forum has been constituted for its 100th anniversary. It is an appeal to all Ezhumanthuruthu residents, living locally and abroad, to come forward to dignify their role in the ceremony. To communicate with the forum an e-mail id has been created. It is also available in the social media, Facebook, (Ezhumanthuruthu Ups). An adhoc committee has been formed under the chairman ship of Mr.Thankamai, the retired headmaster of the school. The history of Ezhumanthuruthu is very interesting for the new generation to know how their forefathers had lived there, struggled there for survival. The book is under preparation. The shathabdi(centenary) celebration is planned for a year-long event to link people of every walk of life. On 27 March 2016, a committee has been formed for the development of the school \\"Govt. UP School Development committee\\" under the patronage of Kaduthuruthy MLA, shri Mons Joseph and President of kaduthuruthy Grama Panchayath. The working committee chairperson is Ward member Mrs. Shyla Aravind, Convenor Dr. Pushpan and Treasurer school Headmaster Mr. Suvarnan T.K. 25 member committee has been formed and more intellectuals and well-wishers staying abroad will be nominated. In the initial sitting the committee has taken decision to start LKG and UKG and English medium classes. =About the library= This library is organised and coordinated by a group of youngsters in the 1990s who arranged benefit shows, collected books and received donations for buying books. Several distinguished people give out their contribution. The library got registration in the state library council. It is now one of the assets for the young generations. Thousands of books are there in the stack. Those who are interested to contribute the development of this library are highly solicited. The name has been given as a memorial of the living legend Netaji Subash Chandra Bose. Places of worship There are some places of worship. The Kunnumel Kavu devi temple is situated on top of a small hill. The deity is a devi and many people from neighbouring places visit every day. This is managed by local SNDP branch. It is often believed that this devi roams in the night hours to see her devotees and to enquire about their well-beings. There was a history in last century that during the tragic flood, people seek asylum on top of the hill because all other surrounding areas were inundated by water. It was a nice scenery from top of the hill to watch the Mundar estate towards Vaikom. Another temple is known as Poonkavil Sri. Balabdra devi. The deity is goddess Baala Bhadra. It is a popular belief among the village folk that devi Baalabhadra looks after the well being of every girl child. Also worshiping and offering the famous Neyyvilakku and Lemon chain by adolescent girls speeds up their wedlock. Another place of worship is the Chelakkapally ammavan. He was a strong warrior of the then Rajhas, fought and martyr. Due to his martyrdom people worship in this temple. Another famous temple is the thrikayil temple. The lord Siva and Ayyappa are the deities and many people visit this temple every day. It is managed by the NSS Karayogam. Vallickeril Gandharva Kshetram is another temple and the Muthappan kavu is also a place of worship. In the yard of Ezhumavil Mana, there is another deity named \\"Sankaranarayanan\\". This was actually installed in the Nadumittam of this mana. After some time this mana was reconstructed and the deity was left in the yard. The deity is popularly known as \\"Mittathu thevar\\" meaning \\"god in the yard\\". Years earlier, one day a \\"bright light appeared in the Nalukett. At that time no namboodiries were there. There were only antharjanams (ladies of Nambudiri family). They found this light quiet unusual and installed in the nalukettu only.\\" Inland water tourism Ezhumanthuruthu is emerging as a hub for the \\"Monsoon tourism\\" and \\"Inland water tourism\\". Several foreigners used to visit the nearby place \\"Mundar estate\\" which has a unique feature that during heavy monsoon and subsequent flood, it is a marvelous experience for people to have a ride on the inundated area. This place is otherwise called as a part of the \\"Upper Kuttanad\\". During paddy-harvesting season it is a nice experience to visitors to watch the village folk engaged in harvesting rice. The Koithupattu, traditional folk song sung by elders is now near extinction. The villagers have a craze on performing boat race during Onam season as a mark of enthusiasm on the arrival of fresh rice, welcome for Onathappan and so on. Ezhumanthuruthu is emerging as a tourist hub of Kaduthuruthy Grama Panchayath. Govt. of Kerala has a project to deepen the river extending towards Vaikom to attract the foreign tourists. House boats and home stay arrangements are available.

He was a right- handed batsman, usually opening the innings, and an occasional wicketkeeper. He played mostly for the Cambridge and Cambridgeshire sides, the North and the United All-England Eleven. In 1859, Carpenter went to North America as a member of the first-ever overseas tour undertaken by the England team and, in 1862‚Äì63, was in the England team to Australia and New Zealand. When travelling to Australia, the team travelled from Liverpool to Melbourne on the SS Great Britain.https://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/11289 He umpired in two Test matches between England and Australia in the 1880s. His son Herbert played for Essex. Carpenter's known first-class career spanned the 1855 to 1876 seasons. He scored 5,220 runs in 141 matches with an average of 24.39, making four centuries with a highest score of 134. A noted fielder, he held 190 catches and made two stumpings. At the end of the 1859 English cricket season, Carpenter was one of the twelve players who took part in cricket's first-ever overseas tour when an England cricket team led by George Parr visited North America. He also toured Australia with Parr in 1863. In the early 1860s, Carpenter and his Cambridgeshire contemporary Thomas Hayward were rated the finest batsmen in England. Richard Daft was among those ranking them as equal first, but George Parr reckoned Carpenter the better of the two.Simon Wilde (1998) Number One: The World's Best Batsmen and Bowlers.

It has grammar schools and high schools along with 2 churches. One of the churches was set on fire in 2004, and was closed for repairs. After about a year the church was reopened. Every year in June summer festival is held to celebrate the culture, customs and the people of the town. Festivities include a ritual during which people sing songs and drop a burning wreath, made of pine cones and flowers, from the bridge on the river. Additional customs follow. Such as setting rafts on the San river. These rafts are double bottomed and develop whirlpools randomly and are very difficult to steer and navigate. They are made out of wooden logs and have a small covered area where the food is stored and kept from getting wet. Rafts leave San river from Ulan√≥w and float to Gda≈Ñsk. This tradition is kept to commemorate the log trade that was a big part of the culture of the town around 100 years ago. People drop baskets of flowers with a candle in the middle on the river. Torches are lit as the wooden hand made rafts continue and are not allowed to return to shore until the torches are burnt out. The mayor of the town overlooks the ceremonies from the boat. The ceremonies end with the cannon shot in the air and the fireworks. The mayor of Ulan√≥w was Andrzej BƒÖk, who was elected in 2005. He died in 2008 and his successor is Stanis≈Çaw Garbacz. History The town of Ulan√≥w was founded in 1616 by a nobleman Stanislaw Ulina. Due to the location at the confluence of the San river and the Tanew, Ulan√≥w was a river port, with a harbour and boat building shops. The town prospered until the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655‚Äì1660), when it was ransacked and destroyed. Following the first partition of Poland, Ulan√≥w was in 1772 annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained within Austrian Galicia until late 1918. In the 19th century, it was a private town, and belonged to several noble families. World War One brought widespread destruction, followed my mass exodus and reduction of the population of Ulan√≥w. As a result, it lost its town charter in 1934, remaining a village until 1958. =Jews of Ulan√≥w= Ulan√≥w was once a multicultural town with Jewish population of about 40%. Around World War I, the Jewish population was halved. Many died during World War I because of hard work and lack of sufficient food. Their homes and businesses were looted during the war. Anti- Semitism was increasing and in 1905 the Jews were falsely charged with denigrating the cross that stood in the road. The Jewish population was decimated in World War Two and none remain today .

History Seafarers' Memorial located at the center of Bangladesh Marine Academy Campus World scenario was changing fast after the WWII (1939‚Äì46). Pakistan along with East Bengal (Bangladesh) became independent in 1947 from British rule. Thereafter, the then Pakistan Government looked into developing various industrial training facilities. As such a scheme for establishing a marine academy beside Bay of Bengal had been sanctioned in 1952. Juldia Point (valleys of Juldia-Rangadia) at the Karnaphuly river-mouth at Bay of Bengal was chosen for the planned academy. Interesting to note that the reason was to create a ‚Äòship-like environment‚Äô due to geographical location the Juldia Point was considered as it was almost like a ship but not floating! Such suitable facility/location was unique in the country and was not available from Suez to South-East Asian countries except India. (Project Plan ‚Äì Development of Marine Academy, Phase ‚Äì II [1973-1980]) Building basic infrastructure commenced. The establishment budget was Taka 31.19 lakhs in 1952, then increased to Taka 53 lakhs in 1959 and finally to Taka 58.3 lakhs in 1961. The initial project was completed with the aim of training 22 Nautical Cadet Officers and 22 Marine Engineering Cadet Officers. The new-built ‚ÄòMercantile Marine Academy‚Äô went into functioning from 3 September 1962. Afterwards, during our Great Liberation War 1971 the then Pakistan Government shifted the Academy's function to Karachi leaving this Academy abandoned. Immediately after liberation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman resumed it as Marine Academy with appointing Capt. (Merchant Marine) M L Rahman as the Commandant (first Bangalee Commandant). Bangabandhu also took a project titled \\"Development of Marine Academy (1973-1980)\\" and could raise the Academy at the forefront of maritime professional excellence in South Asia.

Early years Married in 1860 in South Africa, Thomas and Ann Bailey had four children, Mary, Abraham, Susannah and Alice, before Ann Bailey's premature death in 1872, when young Abe was only seven years old. Bailey's mother, Ann Drummond McEwan, was Scottish by birth while his father, Thomas Bailey, was from Yorkshire. Abe Bailey was sent to England to be educated, first at Keighley and later at Clewer House. After the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, a corps of imperial volunteers from London was formed in late December 1899. The corps included infantry, mounted infantry and artillery divisions and was authorized with the name City of London Imperial Volunteers. It proceeded to South Africa in January 1900, returned in October the same year, and was disbanded in December 1900. Bailey was appointed a lieutenant of the mounted infantry division on 3 January 1900, with the temporary rank of Lieutenant in the Army, but the appointment was later cancelled. Politics In October 1902, Bailey stood unopposed as a Progressive Party candidate for the Barkly West constituency of the Cape Colony Legislative Assembly. The constituency had been represented by Cecil Rhodes until his death earlier the same year. Business Via his business interests and his ties to Cecil Rhodes, Abe Bailey acquired substantial mining and land properties in the former Rhodesia. By the 1930s he was one of the world's wealthiest men. Appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1911, he was created Baronet in 1919, one of a number of \\"Randlords\\" knighted for their services to the British Empire. Cricket Bailey played three first-class matches for Transvaal.. He played an important role in 1912 Triangular Tournament. He first proposed the idea on a trip to England in 1907, stating: \\"Inter-rivalry within the Empire cannot fail to draw together in closer friendly interest all those many thousands of our kinsmen who regard cricket as our national sport, while secondly it would probably give a direct stimulus to amateurism.\\" It was immediately embraced by MCC, who were then lords of all they surveyed, and 1909 was the first year designated for it. But the administrators could not agree and by the time 1912 was alighted on, world cricket was in conflict. But infighting and a poor performance from the South African team ensured that the idea of a tri-nation tournament remained a one- off occurrence. Art collection These interests, as much as his aspirations to the titles and the lifestyle of the English landed gentry were influential in the formation of his personal art collection. This collection was mostly displayed in his London home and moved for safe-keeping to the north of England during the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945). On his death in 1940 the terms of his will placed his collection under the protection of a special trust established in his name and bequeathed it to the South African nation. Bailey was one of the very few South African Randlords to leave a bequest of this nature to South Africa. At his specific recommendation, this collection was placed under the curatorship of the South African National Gallery in Cape Town, where it first went on display in 1947. Numbering over 400 items, including paintings, prints and drawings, the \\"Sir Abe Bailey Bequest\\" is the largest bequest held at the South African National Gallery to this day. It also constitutes one of the largest collections of British sporting art held by any public art museum in the world. The \\"Sir Abe Bailey Trust\\" is actively involved in its maintenance, and conservation work on the collection.

He also saw Franklin D. Roosevelt when his paralytic illness struck, and worked closely with six American presidents. Biography Keen was born in Philadelphia on January 19, 1837, the son of William Williams Keen Sr. (1797‚Äì1882) and Susan Budd. He attended Philadelphia's Central High School. He studied at Brown University, where he graduated in 1859. He graduated in medicine from Jefferson Medical College in 1862. During the Civil War, he worked for the U.S. Army as a surgeon. After the war, he spent two years studying in Paris and Berlin. Keen started lecturing surgical pathology in Philadelphia. He was president of the Philadelphia School of Anatomy from 1875 to 1889. He became known in the medical community around the world for inventing several new procedures in brain surgery, including drainage of the cerebral ventricles and removals of large brain tumors. In 1888 Keen also performed one of the first successful removals of a brain tumor. Keen was the leader of a team of five that performed a secret surgical operation to remove a cancerous jaw tumor on Grover Cleveland in 1893 aboard Elias Cornelius Benedict's yacht Utowana. Keen and four assisting doctors made their way to the yacht by boat from separate points in New York with Cleveland and Bryant boarding in the evening for the night aboard before sailing the next morning. With calm weather the surgery was done shortly after noon as the ship transited Long Island Sound with the removal of the tumor and five teeth, as well as much of the upper left palate and jawbone. On 5 July Cleveland arrived at Gray Gables to recuperate and was fishing in Buzzards Bay by the end of July. Keen married in 1867 to Emma Corinna Borden. They had four children: Corinne, Florence, Dora, and Margaret. He died in Philadelphia on June 7, 1932, at the age of 95 and is interred at The Woodlands Cemetery. Keen's grandson, Walter Jackson Freeman II, became a doctor who specialized in lobotomies. Keen was a theistic evolutionist. In 1922, he authored the book I Believe in God and in Evolution.Anonymous.

In addition to possessing a solid backhand block, Ma Lin also uses the reverse penhold backhand (RPB), an innovative stroke utilizing the underside of the blade which allows a penholder to produce topspin from both wings. The most dangerous weapon Ma Lin has in his arsenal, however, is his consistent forehand loop, which he often uses to end a point decisively. He is also considered a master at serving and his serve is considered one of the best in the world, earning the nickname \\"Ghost Service\\". It involves the ball bouncing back to the net instead of going straight off the table.

He has won the four World Cup trophies (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006), more than any other player in history, but has lost three times in the World Championship finals (1999, 2005, 2007). Ma Lin has been criticized often for his lack of mental resolve, crumbling in crucial moments. Despite his victories in 1999, he performed poorly in the national trials and was denied a berth in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

It was a terminus for transporting airmail in the eastern United States and instigated the first long distance night airmail service across the nation.  Background  The Post Office planned to do night airmail in the early 1920s. It was then using Mineola, New York's Hazlehurst Field on western Long Island for daytime airmail. They also used Belmont Race Track in Elmont, New York, just west of Mineola. These flights were over New York City and in poor weather presented dangerous conditions. The New York air fields were often in fog and smoke, so were inadequate for night flights. The ideal area for night lift-offs and landings would be a level field of land clear in all directions most of the time. The area could be then improved to make a terminal facility that could operate 24 hours a day. Government officials for the United States Post Office scouted for such an area in the eastern United States. Silent film showing beacon lights along route for night airmail service (46 seconds)  Description  The officials for the United States Postal Service found level ground acreage just outside of New Brunswick, New Jersey, that would work for a new 24 hour flight field. John R. Hadley Sr. owned the 144 acre farm in Piscataway Township, New Jersey. He leased seventy-seven acres of his farm to the US Postal Service on November 1, 1924. There were certain improvements made by the US government to make it satisfactory. The land was first cleared to make airplane runway strips. Then radio antenna towers were built and field boundary lights installed. There were powerful floodlights and revolving beacons added so it could conduct night flying. It became known as Hadley Field, after the name of the farmer that owned the property.  History  Postmaster General New with air mail for night flight from Hadley Field July 1, 1925 The airmail operations were completely moved from Hazlehurst Field in New York to Hadley Field in New Jersey by December 15, 1924. The first night flight service for airmail was from Hadley Field and instigated on the evening of July 1, 1925. There were 500,000,000-candlepower arc floodlights that lit Hadley Field for a mile in a semi-circle. There was additionally a searchlight that was on a hangar that revolved six times a minute. There were more than 15,000 spectators that watched pilots Dean Smith and J.D. Hill fly out into the evening sky destined for Cleveland, Ohio, where the mail would be forwarded to Chicago by other planes and pilots. The people were witnesses to the significant inaugural transcontinental night airmail service between the two largest American cities, New York and Chicago. The route was lighted with beacon lights to direct and guide the pilots for night flying. Smith described in his book his initial night flight for the new air mail service as a harrowing experience. He explains that the newsreel cameras were filming while he climbed in the De Haviland model DH-4 airplane. He recounted his take-off from Hadley Field, with eighty-seven pounds of mail, as something out of the ordinary. The engine suddenly throttled down on its own at about a hundred feet altitude as though someone had pulled back on the controls. This was not as desired as the airplane was still climbing to a cruising altitude. He then describes how he managed with difficulty to turn the airplane around and went back to Hadley Field. It was discovered upon examination by the mechanics that there was a mechanical malfunction of the carburetor. It was fixed in two hours with no delay in the schedule and he took off again for his first stop at Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Mail truck & de Havilland airmail plane Later, while in flight engine failure forced him to land in a field at Kylertown, Pennsylvania. Smith was delayed a couple of hours while obtaining another plane to use to continue his airmail delivery to Cleveland. He describes this leg as not any better than his first flight leg. He had run out of gas less than twenty minutes from the airport at Cleveland. He crashed landed upside down in a farmer's vineyard with a broken airplane, but unhurt himself. The farmer asked Smith if this was his normal way of landing. J.D. Hill was the first to get his mail through. He lifted off from Hadley Field at 9:48 P.M. (local time) and arrived at Cleveland at 3:04 A.M. (local time) the next morning, for a total time of a little over 9 hours. The mail was transferred to another plane piloted by Warren Williams who took off at 3:28 A.M., some twenty minutes later. Williams got the mail to Chicago at 6:19 A.M. The first flights of night airmail in and out of Hadley Field were deemed a success. The first plane to arrive at Hadley Field in the new night airmail service carried flowers for Colonel John Coolidge from Vice President Charles G. Dawes and arrived at Hadley Field at 2 A.M. on July 2, 1925. Airmail that arrived at Hadley Field by plane was transported by truck and train to New York City.  Demise and legacy  Once the airmail routes in the United States were established, the service was then done by private carriers instead of the government. Hadley Field closed it operations in 1968 and the property was sold to a real estate developer. A shopping mall was put on the land. There is a historical marker there explaining about Hadley Field. It is listed in Abandoned & Little Known Airfields' database.

History  The original Alloa station was opened by the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway (S&DR;) on 28 August 1850 when the line from to Alloa was opened. In 1850 the main station building was to the west of Greenfield Bridge and south of the rails, it consisted of a ticket office leading onto a platform and an island platform with a \\"passenger shed\\" on the north of the running lines, both \\"arranged as to accommodate parties intending to travel on either the main line or the Tillicoultry branch\\". There was a goods yard, with a large shed, to the north and sidings both sides, on the east of Greenfield Bridge was a two-road engine shed and turntable. Passengers for Stirling were able to continue via ferry along the River Forth to Stirling under their own arrangements, the S&DR; advertised times and fares between Alloa and Dunfermline but made no mention of a ferry. The station became both a junction and a through station on 3 June 1851 when the branches to and Alloa Harbour with a terminal at opened. The station was called Alloa North (and sometimes North Alloa) between 1875 and 1882 after which the North was dropped. Subsequent links were added southwards to via the Alloa Railway in 1885. The network was finally completed in 1906 with the opening of a second line to Dunfermline via and Longannet along the northern bank of the Forth estuary. This line carried a passenger service until July 1930. Freight services ceased on 6 April 1981. A number of alterations were undertaken in 1885 to accommodate the Caledonian Railway using the station when the Alloa swing bridge and branch opened. Prior to these improvements the local newspaper described the NBR station as a \\"small and dingy-looking erection which has ... for many years been an eye-sore to the town's people, and quite inadequate for the traffic; and although it has been improved upon from time to time, these improvements have only made its incapacity to meet the requirements of modern tastes and the greatly increased traffic the more apparent.\\" To accommodate the CR at its station the NBR firstly opened a new goods station on 21 September 1885 to the east of Glasshouse Loan on the Harbour branch in order to create some space at the passenger station, it also undertook some alterations to the station itself prior to a major rebuilding scheduled for the following few years. The CR opened its own goods station at a site on the western side of Glasshouse Loan, directly opposite the NBR one. The CR set up its own passenger booking office at Alloa station, in what had formerly been the parcel office. The rebuilt station opened on 22 November 1887, there was a new station building on the east side of Greenfield Bridge with a gated entrance from the bridge onto a forecourt. The booking hall was described as a \\"fine spacious room\\" with offices for both Companies, and access to the parcel office \\"fitted up with one of the modern hydraulic hoists\\". A wide staircase went down to the platform where there were four waiting rooms; general, ladies, ladies' first-class and gentlemen's first-class. There was a refreshment room, telegraph office, \\"commodious lavatories\\" and railway administration offices. The wide island platform, with two inset bays at its west end extended a long way westward under Greenfield Bridge and had extensive awnings. = Closure = During the mid-1960s the lines around Alloa were progressively closed. The passenger service to Tillicoultry was the first to go on 15 June 1964 (with total closure following on 25 June 1973, with the ending of coal-mining at Dollar). The line across the swing bridge to Larbert followed in January 1968. The station itself together with the main former S&DR; line from via through Alloa and on to Dumfermline Upper was then closed to passengers on 7 October 1968. Freight services continued until 1979, though the nearby Alloa marshalling yard to the west remained open until 1988 (latterly used only by the trip freights to the yeast factory at Menstrie). Following the full closure of Alloa station, a leisure centre was built on the site, though a narrowed formation and a single track was kept for freight services. The remainder of the original S&DR; through the station towards the east continued in use for colliery traffic until 1979 (this has since been lifted) and the Kincardine branch until 6 April 1981. This latter route was left derelict but intact for some years and has since been reopened, along with the station (see below). = Re-opening = Ticket issued on the first day of use by the general public The new station building was designed by IDP Architects. In 2008, the railway reopened, with a new Alloa station situated to the east of its predecessor, due to the earlier construction of the leisure centre. A passenger-operated self-service ticket machine was installed in July 2008; the illustrated ticket was issued at Stirling station. Under Scottish Executive funding, the line between Stirling and Alloa was reopened to both passenger and freight traffic, with a key benefit being a reduction in congestion on the Forth Railway Bridge. Construction work started in 2005, with track laying commencing at the end of September 2006. It was originally projected that the station would reopen to passenger traffic in the Summer of 2007 but this date was then put back to allow for the upgrading of a level crossing. The official opening took place on Thursday, 15 May 2008. Passenger use of the new railway station has greatly exceeded forecasts and since re- opening the service has been improved by increasing evening and Sunday frequencies from two-hourly to hourly and by adding the peak hour service to Edinburgh in 2009. In its first year the station was used by 400,000 passengers, against a forecast of 155,000.  Facilities  The station has a nearby car park with 64 spaces but is not permanently staffed.http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/ALO.aspx The completion of electrification of the railway between Polmont Junction, Stirling, Dunblane and Alloa during 2018 allowed the introduction of electric- powered rolling stock for services from 9 December 2018.  Services  A forming a train to Glasgow Queen Street The current service gives an hourly train to Stirling and Glasgow seven days a week, with an additional peak hour commuter service to Edinburgh running six days a week. The journey time to Stirling is timetabled to take 9‚Äì10 minutes. Services are usually operated by a Class 385, or a .

Grove Press) Cain's Book is a 1960 novel by Scottish beat writer Alexander Trocchi. A roman √† clef, it details the life of Joe Necchi, a heroin addict and writer, who is living and working on a scow on the Hudson River in New York. The book alternates between Necchi/Trocchi's attempts to score and flashbacks to his experiences as a child in Glasgow, and later as a young man in London and Paris. It is also an account of what it means to be a junky and an outsider from society. On occasion it can descend into ranting about the hypocrisy and stupidity of drug prohibition and the general inequities of the world. It describes with an eye for detail the rituals of heroin, the cooking up and the search for a suitable vein. It gets more and more fragmented as it draws to a close with Trocchi realizing that he is incapable of a maintaining a conventional narrative. In being consumed with his addiction, Trocchi strives to document his alienation and his desire to use his creativity against the existentialist fear of being washed away by history with no sign of his life remaining. > When I write I have trouble with my tenses. Where I was tomorrow is where I > am today, where I would be yesterday. I have a horror of committing fraud. > It is all very difficult, the past even more than the future, for the latter > is at least probable, calculable, while the former is beyond the range of > experiment. The past is always a lie clung to by an odour of ancestors. The title of the book gives a clear indication of Trocchi's intentions. He casts himself as beyond society, above laws and morals and wars and guilt. He did not see himself as just a junkie but rather a crusader, the mind-expanding quality of drugs, as he saw it, outweighed any other argument against them. But as Trocchi's later life was to show, his own addiction prevented him from finishing any other book-length project. In 1963 in the UK, Cain's Book was one of many books and magazines seized by the police at a bookseller's shop in Sheffield. Its publisher, John Calder, sought a separate trial for Cain's Book distinguishing it from the hundreds of others that had been confiscated, intending to prevail on the book's literary merit as Penguin Books had done four years before in the trial of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Cain's Book had been published without restriction in the US and France. In April 1964 the UK edition went to trial for obscenity, with six defense witnesses, including author Kenneth Allsop, testifying to its literary value. Three magistrates found against Calder. The case is notable in that the court's judgement was the first in the UK to condemn a book for obscenity not for sexual content but for \\"the lifestyle it advocated.\\" Alistair McCleery wrote, \\"The case gave a new lease of life to the use of obscenity charges against literary works where it could be argued that illegal behavior or behavior detrimental to social norms was being promoted.\\" In response to the unfavorable verdict Trocchi held a public burning of his book, with fireworks.

It delved into the backstories of several prominent characters on the show, and was purportedly written by town witch Tabitha Lenox. Much of the information in Hidden Passions has never been confirmed on- screen, and the book is not considered to be canon because the show has since contradicted it several times. Selected information unique to the novel Hidden Passions provides \\"facts\\" never referenced in the series, like the names of the parents and ancestors of several of the older generation of characters. It is established that Sam Bennett is one of at least four male siblings (the show has only mentioned his younger brother Hank) with parents named Benjamin Bennett and Margaret Joyce, Gwen Hotchkiss's father Jonathan was the nephew of an English earl, and that Tabitha was responsible for a fire that killed Grace and Faith Standish's father Zachary Sutter (their mother was named Mercy Standish). Hidden Passions also explores storylines never mentioned on the show and which do not fit within established continuity. According to the book, Julian Crane and his friend Tommy Biddles had a contest in college to see who could sleep with the most women; it was during this contest that Julian met and fell in love with Eve Johnson. (According to the show, Julian was the same age as Ivy, Sam and T.C., and wed Ivy immediately following high school.) T.C. Russell developed an addiction to pain killers after being accidentally run over by a car, whose passengers were (unbeknownst to TC) Julian and T.C.'s future wife Eve. When Pilar Lopez was fourteen, she left her family in Mexico and moved in with her uncle Carlos and aunt Marta (who lived in New Mexico) so she could get a better education and was only a couple of years older than Ivy, whereas in the show she had worked for the Winthrop family since Ivy was a small child. Information contradicted by the show In Hidden Passions, Alistair Crane hired a man named Wilkes to kill Julian's newborn son with Eve. Wilkes in turn hired a man named Jack to carry out the deed. Jack was uncomfortable with the idea and chose to switch the boy with the body of a deceased crackbaby. Julian and Eve's son went into foster care. The Cranes, including Alistair, were unaware of this. On the series it has been implied that Alistair knew full well about the fate of his missing grandson and that he masterminded the whole thing. In the book, Katherine Barrett Crane died of kidney failure a few years after her daughter Sheridan was born. On the series it was revealed that she and Martin Fitzgerald had faked their deaths and were living under assumed names in Puerto Arena, Mexico. The book established that Eve was the only child of Warren Johnson and Tanya Lincoln, a wealthy couple in Boston. In the series Eve's parents were a poor couple from the south named Warren Johnson and Ruby Lincoln; after Warren's death Ruby married a man with the surname Sanbourne and the two adopted a daughter named Liz. Rebecca Hotchkiss's maiden name in the book is Osburn while on the show it said she is descended from a long line of Osborn women. Rebecca's maiden name has never been stated on-air.

It was founded by members of the Welholme Methodist Church on grass courts in Welholme Road, Grimsby. In order to protect the membership from personal liability the club was formed into a Limited Company (Company number 00179077) on 16 January 1922. The land in Weelsby Avenue was purchased in April 1922 and so the tennis facility on this site predates the surrounding houses that were built in about 1930. Although the Tennis Centre is a Limited Company, its constitution requires that any profits are used to improve the facility. Elected Directors serve for a period as defined in the Memorandum and Articles of Association. Early development of the site Clubhouse of the Grimsby Tennis Centre The former pavilion was of timber; electricity was only installed in 1960 to replace gas lighting. The former bar, towards the right-hand side of the photograph, was erected and opened in 1959 as an addition to the pavilion and it was enlarged a mere 4 years later. Some land at the rear of the former pavilion was purchased in 1961 and land adjacent to the drive was bought as a turf nursery in 1955. A tennis practice wall was built in 1972 and the squash court was built in 1973. It was the second Squash (sport) court in the town and was erected to meet the rising need. Now the boom in squash has subsided the court is used for mini tennis and racquetball. Two hard courts were built in 1984 after the former red shale courts had given good service. In fact they had given more than good service. Each time they were used they had to be dragged and sifting out the large pieces of 'clinker' became a regular occupation. After all of this work it was inevitable that you would travel home with red socks and red legs caused by the fine dust. Change from grass Major development involving erection of a new clubhouse, floodlights, construction of the car park and replacing the grass courts with Tennisweave synthetic grass carpet took place in 1989 after months of careful planning. This high specification artificial grass surface, unlike many synthetic carpet courts, uses very little sand, which therefore provides a good foothold. To finance the ¬£100,000 project, two grass courts nearest to Weelsby Avenue were sold for housing. Leading to success The success of the development produced results on the court and in 1991/92 the Men's teams were particularly successful. The First Team won the Lincolnshire Men's First Division for the first time in the Club's history and the Men's Third Team were promoted to the Third Division. Players in the squad were: Trevor Kelly, Tim Smith, Andrew Lashbrook, Allan Thompson, Jamie Thompson (15), Duncan Proctor. Further progress and development at the site was made in 1993 with the successful application for a Sports Aid Grant which allowed the laying of two all-weather synthetic grass courts to replace the worn out hard courts. The new synthetic grass is different from that already laid with more sand providing a higher bounce during wet weather in particular. In 1994/5, for the first time in its history, the North Kelsey League allowed a Grimsby team to enter the League and Welholme had the honour. 1996/7 saw a Men's veterans team successfully enter a new Lincolnshire Veterans' League, coming second by the width of a sideline at the first attempt. The Peaks Parkway was completed and opened to traffic in October, 1998 and the eastern boundary of the Club was made more secure. March 1999 saw the Men's Veteran's Team finally achieve their reward for some difficult matches and long journeys by winning the Lincolnshire Veterans' League. Lottery funding Directors of the Club embraced the Lawn Tennis Association's Club Vision programme and began work on development of the Club. There are practically no tennis facilities for the disabled and part of the development of the club would address this issue in North Lincolnshire. Detailed and lengthy submissions were made to the Sports Aid Foundation, the National Lottery, the Football Trust and Foundation for Sports and the Arts. Support for the bid was forthcoming from the LTA and a huge redevelopment of the Club started in August 2003. The development, costing ¬£250,000 saw the whole site under construction work. All of the courts were replaced; four synthetic grass courts so enjoyed by players of all abilities, two floodlit acrylic courts as used in the US Open, which are especially good for wheelchair tennis, and a state of the art Club House with ample luxurious accommodation. =Project leader= The project was led from start to finish by Andrew Lashbrook, who was subsequently offered position by the charities funding the work. The grand opening was on 12 April 2003. Change of name In recognition of the scale of the development and the place of the facility as the leading tennis and squash venue in Grimsby, Cleethorpes and the area of North Lincolnshire, the Club changed the name to Grimsby Tennis Centre. The name derived from Grimsby Tennis Club which used to be the premier location for the sport in North Lincolnshire and which hosted many Lincolnshire Closed Tournaments at their grounds in College Street, Grimsby before the memberships dwindled and the land was eventually sold for housing development. Many notable players started their tennis careers at the College Street courts; Shirley Bloomer, Eric King and several local players of high repute in Lincolnshire and beyond:- Bernard Finneran, Matt Sheader, Bill and Connie Moran. Peter Brown and many more. The traditions of the old Club are maintained in the new facilities at Grimsby Tennis Centre.

He terrorized Bucharest between 1970 and 1971. Authorities had made over 2,500 arrests before he was apprehended. Ion R√Æmaru killed four women and attacked more than 10 others. The women were attacked with an axe, bitten on the breasts and thighs and raped after they were already dead. . Biography =Early life= R√Æmaru's parents married in Caracal and had three sons, Ion being their eldest child. His father, and his mother argued almost daily; the couple eventually separated and his father moved to Bucharest, taking a job as a night tram driver. After his death years later, Florea, his father, was discovered to have been a serial killer (see below). Ion was born in Corabia. His early life was a troubled one: he repeated the ninth grade, provoked a public scandal in his home town when he was found to be having a sexual relationship with the minor daughter of his teacher, and, at age 18, was convicted of aggravated theft. Nevertheless, during high school, he always received a perfect grade in conduct. =University= He entered the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1966 with a grade of 5.33 (out of 10). He repeated his second year there. At the time of his arrest, R√Æmaru was in the course of repeating his third year. Although he entered a university, one of his professors described him as shy and semi- literate, with a very poor vocabulary and an extremely narrow range of interests. His roommates reported that he behaved strangely, so they avoided him. When he became enraged, he would harm himself; he was found to have over 20 cuts on his arms and legs. From adolescence, R√Æmaru had an uncontrollable libido. For instance, a university classmate reported that one night, at the dormitory, R√Æmaru did not sleep at all, but instead prowled outside a room where he knew a girl had come to visit a classmate. Doctors diagnosed him with esophageal spasm, reactive nervous syndrome and mental problems in 1967. =Crimes= Bucharest was shaken by a series of crimes committed in the latter half of 1970 and the first months of 1971. An unknown individual would use a hammer, a small axe, an iron bar or a knife to attack restaurant waitresses who were alone and returning from work. He struck after midnight during unusual weather conditions such as snowstorms, driving rain, high winds, freezing cold or fog. Many women would not go outside after 9:00 pm except in large groups or with men. Their terror was heightened by the police's reluctance to release details, leading to wildly exaggerated rumours. After a few crimes, the police realized that they were dealing with a serial killer; a yearlong investigation, with the help of victims who had survived, led to R√Æmaru's arrest on 27 May 1971.Elena Udrea, prima victimƒÉ a lui R√¢maru However, the clue which led directly to R√Æmaru's arrest was a medical diagnosis sheet. On 4 March 1971, a group of six doctors found that he had \\"suspected periodic epilepsy\\"; the doctors' note was found beneath the body of Mihaela Ursu, whom he murdered in especially brutal fashion two months later. Between her fingers she had strands of his hair that were used to identify him (some have suggested that he went to the doctors to eventually be able to claim insanity at trial). Because the note was wet and bloody, only the letterhead from the Bucharest Students' Hospital was visible. At this point the criminal began acting more randomly, not attacking waitresses exclusively and even going after two women who were together. On 15 May specialists determined that the note had been produced in Octavian Ieni»ôte's office in March 1971. He had seen 83 students that month, of whom 15, including R√Æmaru, had not deposited their diagnoses with university officials. The police closely monitored each suspect and three officers went to his dormitory on 27 May; he was not home but while they searched his room he came back at 1:00 pm. In his sack he had an axe and a knife; tests on the hair and bite marks he left and the testimony of witnesses left no reasonable doubt as to his guilt. The 16 gravest offences of which R√Æmaru was convicted are, chronologically: *8/9 April 1970 ‚Äì Elena Oprea ‚Äì premeditated murder (not raped because a neighbor scared him away) *1/2 June 1970 ‚Äì Florica Marcu ‚Äì rape (knocked unconscious in front of her house, carried to Sf√¢nta Vineri cemetery, pushed hard off the fence there, raped, stabbed and had her blood sucked while walking home with him, saved by a truck driver) *19/20 July 1970 ‚Äì OCL Confec»õia store ‚Äì theft of public property *24 July 1970 ‚Äì Margareta Hanganu ‚Äì aggravated theft *22/23 November 1970 ‚Äì Olga BƒÉrƒÉitaru ‚Äì aggravated attempted murder, rape and aggravated theft *15/16 February 1971 ‚Äì Gheorghi»õa Sfetcu ‚Äì aggravated attempted murder and aggravated theft *17/18 February 1971 ‚Äì Elisabeta Florea ‚Äì aggravated attempted murder *4/5 March 1971 ‚Äì FƒÉnica Ilie ‚Äì aggravated premeditated murder, rape and aggravated theft *8/9 April 1971 ‚Äì Gheorghi»õa Popa ‚Äì aggravated murder, rape and aggravated theft (48 stab wounds to the head, chest, groin and legs, five blows to the head, ribs crushed by stomping, genitalia bitten out) *1/2 May 1971 ‚Äì Stana Saracin ‚Äì attempted rape *4/5 May 1971 ‚Äì Mihaela Ursu ‚Äì aggravated murder, rape (he was interrupted in the act and left unsatisfied, leading him to seek a new victim) *4/5 May 1971 ‚Äì Maria Iordache ‚Äì aggravated attempted murder (attacked two hours after Ursu; escaped when he dropped the metal bar with which he was beating her while she was running) *6/7 May 1971 ‚Äì Viorica Tatu ‚Äì aggravated attempted murder *6/7 May 1971 ‚Äì Elena Buluci ‚Äì aggravated attempted murder *May 1971 ‚Äì Iuliana Funzinschi ‚Äì aggravated theft of public property and aggravated theft of private property. After the murder of Popa, a waitress, the authorities went on high alert, launching \\"Operation Vulture\\", named after the street where she had been murdered. 6,000 men from various law-enforcement agencies patrolled the streets of Bucharest each night, as well as 100 cars and 40 motorcycles. Medical personnel, night bus and tram operators, hotel and bar employees ‚Äì all were mobilized, not to mention great numbers of Securitate, Police and Interior Ministry staff. 2,565 arrests were made and over 8,000 individuals were asked for identification, but R√Æmaru would commit one more murder and attempt to commit several more before being arrested. Authorities rated R√Æmaru's modus operandi as ferocious and cruel, based on his propensity for cutting off clothes, biting off flesh, dragging his victims, and hacking away at them with his weapons, also raping them while they were unconscious. R√Æmaru was judged to be aggressive, impulsive and sadistic. He showed signs of vampirism; for instance, he poked several holes into the flesh of Florica Marcu, who later related how he sucked blood out of them. Cannibalism was also present; he would bite women's vaginas, pubic areas and breasts, and the missing pieces of flesh were no longer found at the crime scenes. Additionally, he had necrophiliac tendencies, continuing his rapes after his victims had died and also beating and stabbing their corpses. =Investigation, trial and execution= After his arrest, R√Æmaru remained completely silent, staring expressionlessly into space. The investigators went into an office to decide on a plan; they introduced a police officer who pretended to be a thief into his cell and got him to talk. After two months of interrogations, R√Æmaru admitted to 23 very serious crimes. In fact, he had been arrested for only three murders; the rest (another murder, six attempted murders, five rapes, one attempted rape, and seven thefts of various degrees) he or his father confessed to. On one hand, he tried to convince the authorities that he was not responsible on the grounds of insanity, and that he did not realize the women would die; on the other hand, he insisted he was guilty, asking to be taken to the scenes of his crimes. During police lineups, victims brought in to identify him would tremble when their eyes met his, despite there being no danger to them now. Allegedly, for the public at large, R√Æmaru's name itself inspired a vague dread; r√ÆmƒÉ/r√¢mƒÉ means \\"earthworm\\" in Romanian. The authorities believed that suggestive remarks from his father, who knew all about his son's crimes, had led him to commit violence. During the investigation, his father was arrested three times but released because close relatives could not be forced to testify against other family members. After Ion's last crime, when he robbed a cashier, his mother visited him and found the money under his pillow. His father made him go to the crime scene and showed him what he had done. He then took the money and placed it in his Caracal home, intending to use it to buy a new house. His father was first brought in to the police station during one of Ion's silent phases; the son merely gave his father an ugly look, prompting the latter to say \\"How should I know what you did? How?\\" But he had reason to suspect it, as he had been washing his son's bloody clothes after the attacks. After Ion robbed the cashier, Florea confiscated the ax and knife and it was with these that he was secretly returning when he was arrested. R√Æmaru, whose trial drew significant public attention, thought he had convinced investigators of his insanity defense. He was apparently shocked when he read the report stating that his judgment was not impaired by mental illness, that he did not suffer from hallucinations, delirium, or similar conditions. He immediately changed his plea, recanting his previous confessions in their entirety; thenceforth, he refused to answer even his lawyer's questions. Eventually, R√Æmaru was sentenced to death, with the courtroom erupting in applause when the penalty was pronounced. He appealed, but the Supreme Tribunal upheld the sentence. On 23 October 1971, R√Æmaru was taken to Jilava prison in a van. He had to be dragged to the place of execution from the moment he left the van. Until he was dead, he was in a rage and vigorously tried to escape. The three officers charged with shooting him tied him to a post in the prison yard. Asked, in accordance with the law, if he had any last wishes, he said no. The men noticed him become more agitated, trying to bite off his clothes and twisting around the post. He yelled, \\"Call my father, so he can see what's happening to me! Make him come! He's the only guilty one!\\" and \\"I want to live!\\" Because of his constant movement, it was difficult to aim accurately and in the end, his backside was riddled with bullets (as he had turned all the way round). He was buried in the town cemetery; his grave remains unmarked.R√¢maru, primul criminal √Æn serie al Rom√¢niei moderne Possible motives A psychologist, Tudorel Butoi, viewed tapes of R√Æmaru's interrogations several years after his execution. In Butoi's opinion, R√Æmaru's crimes were a form of compensation for the inferiority complex he had felt since his youth: he was relatively poor, a social misfit, and had had dysfunctional relations with women. At the time, R√Æmaru was labelled a \\"wolf-man\\", and Butoi theorizes that he suffered from a form of clinical lycanthropy. As evidence, he cites his solitary nocturnal prowling and stalking, the instinctual animalistic energy he drew from unusual weather conditions, and how he considered his victims as prey. R√Æmaru would figure out his victims' route, following them home several nights in a row, and attack them when they were almost home. Butoi rejects R√Æmaru's claim to have tried to engage a woman in ordinary conversation one night as \\"merely dissimulations, perverse excuses\\". =A family affair= R√Æmaru's father Florea was also a serial killer. In the summer of 1944, a string of four murders rocked wartime Bucharest. Each victim (all were female) lived in a basement apartment, where the criminal would enter at night during a storm and bash their heads with a blunt object. Each time, the killer left fingerprints and footprints from military boots of size 42 or 43. On 23 October 1972, a year after his son's execution, Florea R√Æmaru died at age 53 after falling off a train. This was officially an accident, but some authors suggest he might have been eliminated by Securitate agents, though the reason for this alleged assassination remains unclear.Hurdubaia; Mutar, \\"Secretele...\\" His body was brought to the Medico-Legal Institute, where the man's height of 174 cm and his shoe size of 42 attracted attention: the 1944 fingerprints matched his. Both their first victims even had similar names: Florea first killed Elena Udrea, while his son Ion killed first Elena Oprea. Butoi, the psychologist, theorised that a gene predisposing one to violent crimes was passed from father to son, as the murders happened under remarkably similar circumstances.Cum erau executati condamnatii Notes References * Cristina Hurdubaia, \\"R√Æmaru a ≈£opƒÉit printre gloan≈£e, pe dupƒÉ st√¢lp\\" (\\"R√Æmaru Jumped through Bullets behind the Post\\"), 16 August 2004, Jurnalul Na»õional * Ofelia Herghelegiu, \\"R√¢maru, vampirul din Bucure≈üti\\" (\\"R√¢maru, the Vampire of Bucharest\\"), Timopolis * Adina Mutar, \\"Secretul lui Ion R√¢maru\\" (\\"Ion R√¢maru's Secret\\"), Ziarul * Adina Mutar, \\"Mo≈ütenirea lui Ion R√¢maru\\" (\\"Ion R√¢maru's Inheritance\\"), Ziarul Category:Romanian serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Romanian rapists Category:Executed serial killers Category:People executed by Romania by firing squad Category:People executed by the Socialist Republic of Romania Category:People from Corabia Category:1946 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Executed Romanian people Category:Necrophiles Category:People convicted of murder by Romania Category:Romanian people convicted of murder ","title":"Ion R√Æmaru"},{"id":"8005628","text":"Location of Hajd√∫-Bihar county in Hungary S√°p is a village in Hajd√∫-Bihar county, in the Northern Great Plain region of eastern Hungary.

Allylic strain (also known as A1,3 strain, 1,3-allylic strain, or A-strain) in organic chemistry is a type of strain energy resulting from the interaction between a substituent on one end of an olefin with an allylic substituent on the other end.Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty Modern Physical Organic Chemistry University Science Books, 2006. If the substituents (R and R') are large enough in size, they can sterically interfere with each other such that one conformer is greatly favored over the other. Allyic strain was first recognized in the literature in 1965 by Johnson and Malhotra. The authors were investigating cyclohexane conformations including endocyclic and exocylic double bonds when they noticed certain conformations were disfavored due to the geometry constraints caused by the double bond. Organic chemists capitalize on the rigidity resulting from allylic strain for use in asymmetric reactions.  Quantifying allylic strain energy  The \\"strain energy\\" of a molecule is a quantity that is difficult to precisely define, so the meaning of this term can easily vary depending on one's interpretation. Instead, an objective way to view the allylic strain of a molecule is through its conformational equilibrium. Comparing the heats of formation of the involved conformers, an overall ŒîHeq can be evaluated. This term gives information about the relative stabilities of the involved conformers and the effect allylic strain has on equilibrium. Heats of formation can be determined experimentally though calorimetric studies; however, calculated enthalpies are more commonly used due to the greater ease of acquisition. Different methods utizilized to estimate conformational equilibrium enthalpy include: the Westheimer method,Eliel, E. L.; Allinger, N. L.; Angyal, S. J.; Morrison, G. A. Conformational Analysis Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York, N. Y., 1965. the homomorph method, and more simply‚Äîusing estimated enthalpies of nonbonded interactions within a molecule. Because all of these methods are approximations, reported strain values for the same molecule can vary and should be used only to give a general idea of the strain energy. = Olefins = Calculated rotational energies for different conformations of 3-methyl-1-butene. Allylic 1,3-strain is most prevalent in 1c, making this conformation the highest in energy. The simplest type of molecules which exhibit allylic strain are olefins. Depending on the substituents, olefins maintain varying degrees of allylic strain. In 3-methyl-1-butene, the interactions between the hydrogen and the two methyl groups in the allylic system cause a change in enthalpy equal to 2 kcal/mol. As expected, with an increase in substituent size, the equilibrium enthalpies between rotamers also increases. For example, when examining 4-methyl-2-pentene which contains an additional allylic methyl group compared to 3-methyl-1-butene, the enthalpy of rotation for the highest energy conformer increases from 2 kcal/mol to 4 kcal/mol. = Cyclic molecules = Various strain interactions shown in red. (Other hydrogens left off for simplicity) Nonbonded 1,3-diaxial interaction energies are commonly used to approximate strain energy in cyclic molecules, as values for these interactions are available. By taking the difference in nonbonded interactions for each conformer, the equilibrium enthalpy can be estimated. The strain energy for methylidenecyclohexane has been calculated to be 4.5 kcalmol‚àí1 using estimations for 1,3-diaxial strain (0.9 kcalmol‚àí1), methyl/hydrogen allylic strain (1.3kcalmol‚àí1), and methyl/methyl allylic strain (7.6 kcalmol‚àí1) values. The strain energy in 1,8-dimethylnaphthalene was calculated to be 7.6 kcalmol‚àí1 and around 12-15 kcalmol‚àí1 for 4,5-dimethylphenanthrene. Allylic strain tends to be greater for cyclic molecules compared to olefins as strain energy increases with increasing rigidity of the system. An in depth summary of allylic strain in six membered rings has been presented in a review by Johnson, F. 1,8-dimethylnaphthalene and 4,5-dimethylphenanthrene  Influencing factors  Several factors influence the energy penalty associated with the allylic strain. In order to relieve strain caused by interaction between the two methyl groups, the cyclohexanes will often exhibit a boat or twist-boat conformation. The boat conformation tends to be the major conformation to the strain. The effect of allylic strain on cis alkenes creates a preference for more linear structures. = Substituent size = The strength of allylic strain increases as the size of the interacting substituents increases. The size of the substituents interacting at the 1 and 3 positions of an allylic group is often the largest factor contributing to the magnitude of the strain. As a rule, larger substituents will create a larger magnitude of strain. Proximity of bulky groups causes an increase in repulsive Van der Waals forces. This quickly increases the magnitude of the strain. The interactions between the hydrogen and methyl group in the allylic system cause a change in enthalpy equal to 3.6 kcal/mol. The strain energy in this system was calculated to be 7.6 kcal/mol due to interactions between the two methyl groups. = Substituent polarity = Polarity also has an effect on allylic strain. In terms of stereoselectivity, polar groups act like large, bulky groups. Even though two groups may have approximately the same A values the polar group will act as though it were much bulkier. This is due to the donor character of the polar group. Polar groups increase the HOMO energy of the œÉ-system in the transition state. This causes the transition state to be in a much more favorable position when the polar group is not interacting in a 1,3 allylic strain.  Hydrogen bonding  A represents the conformation that would occur in most situations due to allylic strain. However, as shown in B a hydrogen bond can form that is energetically favorable and cancels the disfavorable allylic strain. Thus, B is the most stable conformation. With certain polar substituents, hydrogen bonding can occur in the allylic system between the substituents. Rather than the strain that would normally occur in the close group proximity, the hydrogen bond stabilizes the conformation and makes it energetically much more favorable. This scenario occurs when the allylic substituent at the 1 position is a hydrogen bond donor (usually a hydroxyl) and the substituent at the 3 position is a hydrogen bond acceptor (usually an ether). Even in cases where the allylic system could conform to put a much smaller hydrogen in the hydrogen bond acceptor‚Äôs position, it is much more favorable to allow the hydrogen bond to form. = Solvents = Solvents also have an effect on allylic strain. When used in conjunction with knowledge of the effects of polarity on allylic strain, solvents can be very useful in directing the conformation of a product that contains an allylic structure in its transition state. When a bulky and polar solvent is able to interact with one of the substituents in the allylic group, the complex of the solvent can energetically force the bulky complex out of the allylic strain in favor of a smaller group. = Conjugation = Conjugation increases the allylic strain because it forces substituents into a configuration that causes their atoms to be in closer proximity, increasing the strength of repulsive Van der Waals forces. This situation occurs most noticeably when carboxylic acid or ketone is involved as a substituent of the allylic group. Resonance effect on the carboxylic group shifts the CO double bond to a hydroxy group. The carboxylic group will thus function as a hydroxyl group that will cause a large allylic strain to form and cancel the stabilization effects of the extended conjugation. This is very common in enolization reactions and can be viewed in the figure below under \\"Acidic Conditions.\\" In situations where the molecule can either be in a conjugated system or avoid allylic strain, it has been shown that the molecule's major form will be the one that avoids strain. This has been found via the cyclization in the figure below. Under treatment of perchloric acid, molecule A cyclizes into the conjugated system show in molecule B. However, the molecule will rearrange (due to allylic strain) into molecule C, causing molecule C to be the major species. Thus, the magnitude of destabilization via the allyic strain outweighs the stabilization caused by the conjugated system. Molecule A undergoes cyclization after treatment with perchloric acid. Due to the allylic strain in molecule B, the molecule was found not to exhibit conjugation stabilization and was stabilized in the formation shown in C. Thus, allylic strain outweighs the stabilization effects of a conjugated system. = Acidic conditions = In cases where an enolization is occurring around an allylic group (usually as part of a cyclic system), A1,3 strain can cause the reaction to be nearly impossible. In these situations, acid treatment would normally cause the alkene to become protonated, moving the double bond to the carboxylic group, changing it to a hydroxy group. The resulting allylic strain between the alcohol and the other group involved in the allylic system is so great that the reaction can not occur under normal thermodynamic conditions. This same enolization occurs much more rapidly under basic conditions, as the carboxylic group is retained in the transition state and allows the molecule to adopt a conformation that does not cause allylic strain. The keto form (left) cannot undergo enolization under normal acidic conditions, due to the formation of allylic strain (middle). Thus, under normal thermodynamic conditions, the molecule cannot undergo bromation (right). Application of allylic strain in organic reactions and total synthesis right =Origin of stereoselectivity of organic reactions from allylic strain= When one is considering allylic strain, one needs to consider the possible conformers and the possible stereoelectronic demand of the reaction. For example, in the conformation of (Z)-4-methylpent-2-ene, the molecule isn't frozen in the favored conformer but rotates in the dihedral angle around 30¬∞ at <1kcal/mol cost. In stereoselective reactions, there are 2 effects of allylic strain on the reaction which is the sterics effect and the electronic effects. The sterics effect is where the largest group prefer to be the farthest from the alkene. The electronic effect is where the orbitals of the subsituents prefer to align anti or outside of the orbitals depending on the reaction. right =Hydroboration reaction= The hydroboration reaction is a useful reaction to functionalize alkenes to alcohols. In the reaction the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group fulfill 2 roles in directing the stereoselectivity of the reaction. First, the bulky size of TMS helped the molecule to preferably adopt a conformation where the TMS is not close to the methyl group on the alkene. Second, the TMS group conferred a stereoelectronic effect on the molecule by adopting an anti conformation to the directing orbitals of the alkene. For the regioselectivity of the reaction, the TMS group can stabilize the developing partial positive charge on the secondary carbon a lot better than a methyl group. =Aldol reaction = In the highly versatile and widely used Evans‚Äô Aldol Reaction, allylic strain played a major role in the development of the reaction. The Z enolate was created to avoid the allylic strain with oxazolidinone. The formation of a specific enolate enforces the development of relative stereochemistry throughout the reaction, making the aldol reaction a very predictive and useful methodology out there to synthesize chiral molecules. The absolute stereochemistry is then determined by the chirality of the oxazolidinone. There is another aspect of aldol reaction that is influenced by the allylic strain. On the second aldol reaction, the product which is a 1,3 dicarbonyl is formed in high diastereoselectivity. This is because the acidity of the proton is significantly reduced because for the deprotonation to occur, it will have to go through a developing allylic strain in the unfavored conformation. In the favored conformation, the proton is not aligned properly for deprotonation to occur. left center =Diels-Alder reaction= In an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction, asymmetric induction can be induced through allylic 1,3 strain on the diene or the dienophile. In the following example, the methyl group on the dienophile forced the molecule to adopt that specific 6-membered ring conformation on the molecule. center In the model studies to synthesize chlorothricolide, an intramolecular Diels Alder reaction gave a mixture of diastereomers. But by installing the a bulky TMS substituent, the reaction gave the desired product in high diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity in good yield. The bulky TMS substituent helps enhance allylic 1,3 strain in the conformation of the molecule. center =Total synthesis of natural products= In the seminar paper on the total synthesis of (+)-monensin, Kishi and co-workers utilized the allylic strain to induce asymmetric induction in the hydroboration oxidation reaction. The reaction is regioselective and stereoselective. The regioselectivity of the reaction is due to the significant positive character developed at the tertiary carbon. The stereoselectivity of the reaction is due to the attack by the borane from the least hindered side to which is where the methyl group lies at. center  References   External links  * Advanced Organic Chemistry Lecture Notes (Evans, D.

Morrison played in the League of Ireland for Sligo Rovers and had three separate seasons for his hometown club Derry City. He also played for English sides Sheffield Wednesday, Hull City, Sheffield United, Stockport County and Bradford City, as well as Dunfermline Athletic in Scotland. Career After playing as a youth with Derry City in the League of Ireland, he began his senior career with Sheffield Wednesday during which he had a loan spell with Hull City. After 55 league appearances and eight goals in just under five seasons with the club he joined their rivals Sheffield United in 2003. He departed Sheffield United just five months later after refusing to sign a new contract after playing only eight league matches and joined Stockport County. He left Stockport after just over a year and joined Bradford City after an initial loan period. However, Morrison fell out of manager Colin Todd's plans and made only 32 league appearances for the club before being sacked in May 2006 due to breaches of discipline. He did though endear himself to Bantams fans by scoring a last gasp winner against former club Sheffield Wednesday in a Yorkshire derby in February 2005 that kept the club in the play off hunt before ultimately falling short . Morrison joined Dunfermline Athletic in July 2006 after a successful trial and scored his first goal for the club in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Rangers in August 2006 He has been capped by Northern Ireland at Under-21 level and was last called up to the senior team in 2001 but was not capped. Morrison completed a week-long trial with Chinese side Qingdao Zhongneng in February 2007 and was offered a contract. The move was cancelled and Morrison was initially offered a new one-year extension but rejected this. Morrison signed a new contract extension with The Pars a month later. After almost two years with the Pars, Morrison was returned to Derry City by manager Stephen Kenny, whom he played under while at Dunfermline. However, in September 2008, only a few months after his return to the Brandywell, Morrison was released from his contract by mutual consent. In 2009, Owen Morrison was unveiled as one of two new players, the other being Stephen Parkhouse, joining Sligo Rovers upon the return of Paul Cook to the club.

GDS was established as an executive agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and since 1 April 2009 has been a constituent part of The Food and Environment Research Agency, a newly formed executive agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The first, and only, Chief Executive of the GDS agency was Robert Bettley-Smith FRICS, appointed on the agency's creation in 2005. While the agency has pointed out that it was not set up due to increased CBRN terrorism in particular, it accepts that the driving force behind the agency's creation was the increased threat the UK faced from terrorism as a whole and the need to strengthen the level of the nation's preparedness across the board. History The CBRN Resilience Programme was established in October 2001, as part of the Government's Capability Programme, with the main aim of ensuring that, in the event of a terrorist attack, the response from both central and local government and the emergency services would be quick and effective enough to minimise the impact on people, property and the environment. The programme, as well as forums and sub-groups within it, is chaired by the Home Office. Partners and stakeholders in the programme represent bodies throughout local and central government and the public and private sectors. The decision to form the agency was developed through the CBRN Resilience Programme. Throughout 2003 and 2004, national guidance on the decontamination of both people and the environment was published by DEFRA. In December 2003, a Government-sponsored report as to whether the UK needed a national organisation to help in the recovery phase of any accident identified that the need existed. Local authorities had already been responsible for the clean-up in the aftermath of such crises (this responsibility would be set out in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004) and would remain so. The new organisation would exist to aid those efforts, not assume responsibility for them. In March, 2004, the Government announced that it was actively considering setting up a UK-wide service to provide advice to those bodies undertaking decontamination and clean-up after a release, deliberate or accidental, of hazardous materials. In January 2005, the then Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment, Elliot Morley, MP, announced that the Government had spent the last year working out the potential costs and benefits of such a service and now intended to set one up. On 21 July 2005, the then Secretary of State, The Rt Hon Margaret Beckett, MP gave a written statement to the House, announcing the creation of the agency and the appointment of its Chief Executive. It came into existence on 1 October that year. Although without any powers itself, the new agency would provide its assistance to the whole of the UK. In Wales, where CBRN resilience remained undevolved, the Welsh Assembly Government was consulted and its support announced. In Scotland, where CBRN policy had been devolved, the Scottish Executive was actively involved in the agency's establishment and provided ¬£250,000 to its formation. Initial funding from other stakeholders included ¬£950,000 from the agency's parent department, DEFRA, and ¬£55,000 from the Northern Ireland Office. DEFRA's contribution was part of ¬£5.22m transferred from the Cabinet Office to fund the research required to set the agency up in the first place. GDS spent its first few months identifying where in the private sector there lay specialist expertise and experience on which to call in an emergency. Late in 2005, the agency held a stakeholder event where it publicised its 'open for business' status and the fact that it had developed a framework of suppliers of specialist knowledge and skills. Role The UK Government Decontamination Service's functions revolve around it ensuring that the country is prepared for CBRN and HAZMAT events and is able to cope efficiently during their aftermath. They do not take responsibility for clean- up or decontamination themselves, rather making sure that those with the responsibility (local authorities, emergency services, other government bodies) have access to the specialist knowledge, skills and equipment they may need to carry out such work. They assess the ability of such specialist private sector companies to carry out decontamination operations and are also available to co-ordinate all parties concerned in the event. The agency regularly validate and test the contingency arrangements which are in place with local authorities. Through this work, they are able to act as the Government's advisor on the state of readiness of the country to face such accidents. They also regularly review gaps in the UK's national capability to respond to them. The agency exists as a central portal for local authorities and central government, connecting those needing information with those organisations best able to provide it. In general, advice is given by specialist, third-party companies rather than the agency itself. Despite its name, the GDS is keen to point out that, while recovery and re-occupation of buildings and environments after incidents is part of its responsibility, the more immediate concerns of human decontamination is the remit of the Department of Health and the national health services. GDS state that one reason they have been set up is that Government has recognised it would not be cost effective to have all local authorities research and maintain the level of expertise required to efficiently respond to a CBRN threat. They state this is also the reason why the service is UK-wide, rather than having the home countries maintain separate services.

MN 310 travels north through the city as 5th Avenue NW. It passes just west of the Roseau County Fairgrounds before leaving the city and continuing north through rural northern Minnesota. A few miles north of Roseau, the route crosses the Roseau River, then bends slightly to the east to avoid crossing it twice. North of the Roseau River, the highway crosses the Sprague Creek before entering the Lost River State Forest.

Location  The hamlet is northeast of the county town of Trowbridge. It is only accessible via Whaddon Lane which connects the hamlet to Hilperton. The River Avon and the Kennet and Avon Canal, half a mile apart, define the natural boundaries of the hamlet. The river separates Whaddon from the village of Holt, and the canal separates it from Hilperton and Semington.  History  Archaeological finds at the current location of the hamlet indicate occupation as early as the Iron Age, lasting into Roman times. Under the name of Wadone, the village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, being held by a Saxon called Alvric, supporting two plough teams, and also having meadow and pasture. The Saxons used wood both for building and their utensils, so they have left little evidence in the archaeological record, other than a possible fragment of late Saxon pottery found at the site. At that time, Whaddon included Paxcroft, now part of Hilperton; the total population would probably have been between 15 and 25 people. The village was then located on the major road going from Trowbridge through Hilperton to Whaddon and then alongside the river Avon to Melksham. By 1428, the population of Whaddon counted 10 householders; then it rose to 36 people in 1801 and further to 63 in 1821. For a long time, Whaddon was a separate parish; but in 1894 it was merged with Semington parish, and since then the population of Whaddon on its own has not been recorded. It was not until the late 20th century that Whaddon was united with its more obvious neighbour, Hilperton.  St. Mary's Church  The church of St. Mary the Virgin was built by the 12th century and still contains a blocked 12th century north doorway and a reconstructed 12th century south doorway with a decorated tympanum. Later in the 14th century the church was altered, and the door is made of two 14th century oak panels with heavy hinges. In 1676-8 the church was rebuilt, and c.1778 pulled down and rebuilt again. The present chancel was built in 1879 because damage to the foundations, caused by the work of 1778, was responsible for cracks in the walls and roof damage. It is Grade II* listed.

It is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List due to its ever-shrinking habitat. Macaca pagensis formerly included the overall darker Siberut macaque as a subspecies, but this arrangement is polyphyletic,Roos, C., T. Zieglerb, J. K. Hodgesb, H. Zischlera, and C. Abegg. 2003.

Both were formerly considered subspecies of the southern pig-tailed macaque.  Description  Pagai Island macaque males are generally larger than females. The males' body lengths range from 45‚Äì55 cm and females' body lengths are around 40‚Äì45 cm. Tail length is 13‚Äì16 cm for males and 10‚Äì13 cm for females. Males are also heavier, weighing around 6‚Äì9 kg while females weigh 4.5‚Äì6 kg. Their backs have a dark brown coloration, and chestnut to pale ochre on the sides of the neck, the front of the shoulders and the undersides of this species. Legs are brown and their arms, reddish brown. The faces of Mentawai macaques are furless and black- skinned with brown eyes. They have cheek pouches to carry food while foraging.  Habitat and ecology  The macaques' natural habitat is rainforest, but they can also be found in riverine and coastal swamp-forests. They live high above the forest floor in the canopy, forage between 24 and 36 meters and may sleep as high as 45 meters. The primary food of the species is figs. They may split into splinter groups to forage for food and to sleep. They will eat alongside groups of Mentawai langurs. M. pagensis groups consist of around five to 25 individuals. Typically, a group consists of a single male with adult females and their offspring. The male decides where to go and communicates this to the rest of the group with high-pitched cries. Roaming, solitary Pagai Island macaques may challenge the dominant male for his position, leading to aggressive fights. The natural predators of the species are the crested serpent eagle and the reticulated python. When these predators are spotted, the macaques will alert the rest of the group with a short, gruff bark.  Reproduction  Females show fertility and willingness to mate by displaying their swollen and reddened genitals. Females crouch to initiate mating. The gestation period is between five and six months. A single offspring is born during the night. The mother eats the placenta and licks the infant clean before morning. The mother and young share a close bond into adulthood.  Population and threats  The species' primary habitat is on the Mentawai Islands 150 km off the west coast of Sumatra. They populate three of the four major islands in the chain (North Pagai, South Pagai and Sipura). Due to deforestation by immigrants from the Indonesian mainland, the species is now listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list. The primary reasons behind deforestation on the island are the clearing of large areas of land for cash crop and oil palm plantations, as well as commercial logging. As a result, the water levels in the forest rivers fluctuate to a much greater degree than before. The alternating flooding and low water levels has also caused an increase in the population of malarial mosquitoes.

Born in Calgary, Alberta, Wicks graduated from McLean High School in Haney, British Columbia, Canada in 1930. He was one of the first employees of the BC Plywoods Company (now defunct), and in 1940 he joined the BC Electric Railway Co., where he worked as a streetcar operator within the Vancouver transit system. He joined the Social Credit movement in 1943 and became actively involved in its organisational efforts. From 1946 to 1948, Wicks was elected Vice-President of the Social Credit Association of Canada, British Columbia Section. He also took on the position of Chairman of the Vancouver and District Social Credit Council in 1948. In 1949 Lyle Wicks became the founding President of the British Columbia Social Credit League. He was re-elected to this position until the time of his resignation in October 1952. As president, Wicks recruited W.A.C. Bennett to the nascent party after Bennett bolted the British Columbia Conservative Party to sit as an independent MLA in March 1951. In the 1952 convention to elect the party's leader, both Wicks and Bennett were nominated for the party's leadership. Wicks and Bennett both withdrew in favour of Reverend Ernest George Hansell, an Alberta Social Credit MP hand-picked by Alberta Premier Ernest Manning to lead the British Columbia party. Following the June 1952 provincial election, which was unexpectedly won by Social Credit, Wicks called a new leadership convention at which only Social Credit MLAs could vote thus ending the influence of the Alberta party. The leadership vote was won by Bennett. Wicks was elected MLA for the Dewdney constituency in the 1952 election; in August he was appointed Minister of Labour in Bennett's cabinet. The first session of the Social Credit Party took place in 1953. In September 1956 Wicks was appointed Minister of Railways, a portfolio he held until March 1959, at which time he was appointed Minister of Commercial Transport. He also served as the acting Minister of Agriculture for several months in 1959. During his political career, he played an active role in the establishment of the Albion Ferry on the Fraser River, the development of Alouette Park, the establishment of the Maple Ridge and Mission Hospitals, the completion of the north shore highway connecting Agassiz to Hope, and in the construction of the Agassiz- Rosedale Bridge. He was made an Honorary Chief of the Kwakuitl Indian Nation in Harrison Hot Springs, BC in 1958. Wicks was defeated in the 1960 general election by future British Columbia Premier Dave Barrett. From 1961 to 1973 he served as a member of the Board of the Public Utilities Commission, which was abolished in 1973. Lyle Wicks died in 2004.

It was planned by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway as to get access to the mineral deposits on the line of route, but also as a tactical measure to keep the rival Caledonian Railway out of Fife. There were serious difficulties at the time of opening about a commitment to lease the railway, but it finally opened throughout in 1852. There was a branch to Tillicoultry, and the Devon Valley Railway built a line from there to Kinross.. A predecessor line, the Alloa Railway, had been developed as a horse-operated waggonway in the eighteenth century, bringing coal from the hinterland to Alloa and Clackmannan harbours; in its day the line was technologically advanced, but it was eclipsed by the modern Stirling and Dunfermline line. The Alva Railway built a short branch line from Cambus, on the Stirling and Dunfermline line, opening in 1863. Finally the Caledonian Railway built a viaduct over the Forth at Alloa, and the Caledonian and the North British Railway (which had taken over the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway) collaborated in operating the new short cut; much passenger and goods traffic ran over the bridge; the route was shared, with each company having running powers over the other's line. All these lines closed in the period following 1950 when rail travel was waning, but the section between Stirling and Alloa has reopened in 2008, and carries a regular passenger service.A specially chartered steam train passes Bogside signal box in 1959. History =Before railways= Dunfermline and Stirling had long been centres of commerce, and of regional government, and of industry. Intermediately, the town of Alloa, also situated close to the Forth, was an important industrial centre, known for brewing, glass manufacture, woollen goods, and collieries. On the north side of the tract of land following the Forth the Ochil Hills present a natural barrier to northwards travel, being closest at the Stirling end. =The Alloa Railway= Alloa railway system, 1766 The Earls of Mar owned extensive lands in the hinterland of Alloa, and for some centuries coal had been produced from pits on the estate. An extensive system of waggonways, initially wooden railed, later wood with iron facings, was installed from about 1768 to move the coal, using horsepower and gravity, from the pits downhill to the Forth. =A frenzy of railway authorisation= In 1842 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened its main line, and intercity railway travel was possible in Scotland. The line was immediately profitable, and showed that an inter-city railway could be a commercial success. The English railway network was growing in density and thoughts now turned, not merely towards connecting to the English system, but to the formation of a Scottish network too. The easy availability of money resulted in a very considerable number of Scottish lines being proposed in the following years, and in the 1845 Parliamentary session many were authorised. Among them were the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway, planned to cross Fife from a ferry pier at Burntisland to Perth, and to a ferry pier on the Tay opposite Broughty Ferry. Also authorised was the North British Railway (to build from Edinburgh to Berwick, and the Scottish Central Railway, to build from the Edinburgh and Glasgow line near Castlecary to Perth, and the Caledonian Railway, to build from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle. The fragmented nature of these authorisations resulted in an immediate search for alliances, and even before much construction had taken place, some companies' boards thought it essential to seek to control as much territory as possible, by friendly alliance or by takeover. Many of these alliances were quickly agreed, and in many cases without much strategic thought. =Authorisation of the S&DR;= The Stirling and Dunfermline Railway system in 1852The Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway (successor to the Edinburgh and Northern Railway) was authorised to make a branch from Thornton (near present-day Glenrothes) to Dunfermline. Dunfermline was an ancient seat of government and industry, but it was the minerals, especially coal, in the area which encouraged the building of a line. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway too saw that potential, and promoted a nominally independent company, the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway, which would capture the Alloa coalfield and develop other mineral locations at Dunfermline and elsewhere on the line of route The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway sought to expand northwards and formed an alliance with the Scottish Central Railway, and submitted a Parliamentary Bill for the 1846 session for a Stirling and Dunfermline Railway. As well as opening up a considerable area of agricultural land, the line would give the E&GR; access to areas of mineral extraction along the line of route, and beyond Dunfermline as well. Coal was the dominant mineral, but some blackband ironstone was being extracted and limestone was being fired on the northern shore of the Forth. A Special Meeting of E&GR; shareholders was held on 12 May 1846 to give approval to the merger and the promotion of the Stirling and Dunfermline line.Falkirk Herald and Stirlingshire Monthly Advertiser, 14 May 1846 A 35-year lease contract had been agreed, paying 4% rent on the construction cost of the S&D; after 35% of receipts for operating expenses.Dundee, Perth, and Cupar Advertiser: Friday 12 September 1845 The Stirling and Dunfermline Railway was authorised on 16 July 1846. As well as the main line between the places in the name, branches were authorised to Tillicoultry and to Alloa Harbour. The authorised capital for over 24 miles of railway was ¬£390,000. In 1847 and again in 1848 a number of diversions of the route, and of local tramways, were authorised.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The planned merger of the E&GR; and the Scottish Central Railway \\"on equal terms\\" would give the E&GR; the necessary access to Stirling; however during 1847 the Scottish Central reconsidered its alliance, and it decided that the Caledonian Railway, with which it was to connect near Castlecary, would be a better partner, and it rejected the intended link with the E&GR.; Suddenly the E&GR; found that it had no railway link to the S&DR;, and the S&DR; found itself isolated. =Opening= Locomotives in the yard at Stirling in 1948A line from Dunfermline to Charlestown Harbour was already in existence, and the S&D; line was constructed from east to west, taking advantage of the facility. The first section, from Dunfermline to Oakley, opened on 13 December 1849. There were ironstone and coal deposits at Oakley, and in 1845 the Forth Iron Works started construction of its plant there. It began production the following year.Extract from Mining District Report, 1847, on Scottish Mining Website http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/107.htmlDescription of Carnock Parish in 1862; edited extract from Westwood's Directory for the Counties of Fife & Kinross, published 1862, on Genuki website at http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/sct/FIF/parishes/Carnock/ The line was extended to Alloa on 28 August 1850. On 3 June 1851 a branch to Alloa Harbour, already connected to the Alloa Railway, was opened, together with the Tillicoultry branch. In addition a passenger station was opened at the harbour; it was named Alloa Ferry, opening the same day. There was a long established ferry service crossing the Forth at this point, and the Scottish Central Railway had opened a branch from its main line to South Alloa, meeting the ferry on the south side, on 12 September 1850.Gordon Stansfield, Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine 2002, The Tillicoultry branch had been delayed because of difficulties in constructing a bridge over the River Devon at Glenfoot. Although the final section to Stirling was relatively short, the opening of that part of the line was much delayed by a dispute. The Stirling and Dunfermline company had never intended to operate the line itself, and had contracted with its sponsor, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, that the latter would lease the line and operate it on its completion. Since that time the E&GR; had failed to acquire the Scottish Central Railway, which lay between the two lines, and the SCR had become hostile. The E&GR; had other priorities and now saw that operating a remote section of line would be a considerable liability, and it declined to do so. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway had undertaken to lease and work the line on the assumption of merging with the Scottish Central Railway, but this arrangement had fallen through. As the day of opening of the S&DR; approached, it became obvious that the E&GR; intended to evade its obligations to lease and work the line. On 6 April 1849 the Engineer Miller issued a certificate that the line was complete (to Oakley) but the E&GR; declined to lease it as had been agreed.Caledonian Mercury, 1 October 1849 Faced with legal action to force compliance, the E&GR; used the letter of the contract it had made with the S&DR;, insisting on completion of the S&DR; as authorised, and declining to accept any deviation at Stirling to accommodate a connection with the SCR. (The SCR was prepared to accept the S&DR; crossing the Forth at Stirling on its bridge there, and using their station, but the E&GR; insisted on separate facilities being provided. Nonetheless \\"Dunfermline Line Junction\\" at Stirling was a recognised location south of Stirling station into the 1970s.) The S&DR; had not the resources to operate the line itself and applied for legal sanction to oblige the E&GR; to comply with its obligation, and the E&GR; used every device to avoid compliance. In particular in demanded that the S&DR; build an independent line crossing the Forth at Stirling, and station facilities there (in accordance with the original Parliamentary authority), even though the SCR had indicated that it was prepared to allow the SCR to use its bridge and terminal. Eventually on 1 July 1852 the line was opened throughout to Stirling. The passenger service at Alloa Ferry was closed on the same day, having been little used. A connection between the S&DR; and the SCR lines was soon made south of the river at Stirling and the unnecessary S&DR; terminal station fell into disuse.Peter Marshall, The Scottish Central Railway: Perth to Stirling, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1998, Even now the E&GR; refused to operate the line, and the S&DR; had to acquire three locomotives and the rolling stock to do so itself.Marshall states that the E&NR; and the SCR together worked the line; it is likely that this is correct, but that they made their willingness conditional on the S&DR; actually procuring the locomotives. Nonetheless the railway was open, and a normal train service was in operation. =Company takeovers= The Stirling and Dunfermline Company was vested in the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&GR;) by Act of 28 July 1858. The E&GR; was already a significant player: it opened its main line in 1842. Having started as an inter-city line the E&GR; had been collaborating with the Monkland Railways and others in handling coal and iron in the west of Scotland, which became a dominant traffic. Now it had access to Dunfermline, and the west Fife coalfield. The E&GR; itself was taken over by the North British Railway on 1 August 1865. The Scottish Central Railway was absorbed by the Caledonian Railway in 1865. =The Alva Railway= Alva was a significant manufacturing town, especially of woollens and textiles, located north of the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway, under the Ochil hills. The Alva Railway was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 22 July 1861; it was to be a 3¬Ω mile branch to Alva from Cambus on the S&DR; main line, with an intermediate station at Menstrie. It opened on 11 June 1863.Carter, page 330, and Awdry, page 116; Thomas and Turnock say 3 June. There was an important distillery at Glenochil, near Menstrie.William Scott Bruce, The Railways of Fife, The Melven Press, Edinburgh, 1980, The Alva Railway merged with the E&GR; by Act of 23 June 1864, with effect from 31 July 1864. The line had a busy passenger service, nine daily departures in 1922 and 10 in 1949 with a late Saturdays- only service from Alloa to Alva and back. The Alva branch closed to passenger trains on 1 November 1954, but a general goods service continued until 1964, with company trains to Menstrie continuing until January 1965. =Alloa docks enlarged= In 1875, the NBR agreed to provide new sidings to the newly enlarged Alloa docks, but complications with the adaptation of the Alloa Coal Company's high level tramway delayed their connection for two years.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, =The railway across the Forth= Piers of the dismantled Alloa Forth bridge The Alloa Railway was built to connect Alloa to the south via a bridge over the River Forth. The Company authorised to do this was acquired by the Caledonian Railway before it opened the line in 1885. The line was connected to the North British Railway and used their station in . =The Devon Valley Railway= Proposals to link Stirling and Kinross through Tillicoultry had been formulated early in the history of railways in the region, and when the Tillicoultry branch of the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway was authorised, promoters planned a railway from Tillicoultry to Kinross. As such it would complete a line from the Clyde to the Tay. This became the Devon Valley Railway which was authorised by Parliament on 23 July 1858, but although parts of the line were quickly completed, difficult conditions in the central section meant that it was not until 1 May 1879 that it opened throughout. It was absorbed by the North British Railway on 29 June 1875.Thomas and Turnock, page 36 =The Kincardine line= The Caledonian Railway was constantly trying to penetrate the Fife area to get access to east coast harbours and the coalfields. In an attempt to forestall one such scheme, the North British Railway itself obtained authorisation for a coastal line from Alloa through Clackmannan to Kincardine. It opened on 18 December 1893, and was extended to Dunfermline on 30 June 1906.Thomas and Turnock, page 38 Passenger services, 1895 In an 1895 edition of Bradshaw, there were 12 westbound and 11 eastbound trains between Stirling and Dunfermline, as well as some short working between Alloa and Stirling. Some trains omitted all or most stops between Dunfermline and Alloa. Nine trains left Alloa for Tillicoultry and beyond, and six left Alloa for Larbert. The Alva branch had 12 round trips, most of them continuing from Cambus to Alloa. Five trains, six on Saturdays, left Alloa for Kincardine. None of these services operated on Sundays.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, Closure In the period following 1950 the increased use of road transport for passenger and goods led to a steep decline in the use of the lines, and passenger trains on the Alva branch ceased to run from 1 November 1954. A limited service to Menstrie continued until complete closure on 2 March 1964. The S&DR; Tillicoultry branch, by then regarded as part of the Devon Valley line, closed to passengers on 15 June 1964 and to goods traffic on 25 June 1973. NBR route passenger trains over the Alloa Viaduct were withdrawn from 29 January 1968,Thomas and Turnock page 312; 16 March according to Paterson, pages 85 and 86. and through goods train operation ceased in May 1968. A limited goods service to supply coal to the stationary steam engine that operated the Forth Swing Bridge from Alloa continued until May 1970. Passenger services on the Stirling to Dunfermline main line were closed on 7 October 1968; through goods services were closed on 10 October 1979. West of Dunfermline, the line through Dunfermline Upper station served Oakley Colliery until 1984. The line remained in place as far as Oakley until 1993, but was subsequently lost to road development within Dunfermline. Just eight years later, studies began for the reopening of the western end of the line from Stirling to Alloa, as part of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link.

Originally called a \\"destroyer leader\\" or frigate, in 1975 she was redesignated a cruiser in the Navy's ship reclassification. The ship entered service in 1963 and participated in the Vietnam War. Service history Worden was laid down on 19 September 1961 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; launched on 2 June 1962; sponsored by Mrs. William R. Smedberg III; and commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts on 3 August 1963, Captain Scott Lothrop in command.United States Navy. Dictionary of American Naval Fighting ships ‚Äì Worden IV Following her commissioning, Worden spent a two-month fitting-put period at the Boston Naval Shipyard. The guided missile frigate departed Boston on 12 October, bound for Bermuda for shakedown training. She then proceeded to Hampton Roads and sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 28 October for her home port, San Diego, California, arriving there on 13 November. Following a trip to Dabob Bay and Seattle, Washington for sonar measurements, Worden became the flagship of her squadron. In January 1964, Worden fired a series of missiles at the Pacific Missile Range for systems qualifications tests. She continued operations in the San Diego area until she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in March for a post-shakedown availability which was completed in early May. From 18 May to 26 June, the ship participated in underway training at San Diego. Wordens first fleet exercise took place from 10 to 17 July, a major anti-air warfare exercise. On 11 August 1964, the frigate sailed for the western Pacific for a Far East deployment. After refueling at Midway and Guam, the ship arrived in Subic Bay, Philippines, on 30 August and became an active participant in 7th Fleet activities. Worden visited Yokosuka, Japan, in late October and early November, then continued operations in Southeast Asia until the end of 1964. On New Year's Day, 1965, Worden entered the port of Hong Kong for a period of rest and recreation. After a brief visit to Yokosuka, Japan, the frigate set course for the United States on 24 January. The ship arrived at her home port on 17 February and remained in port through 5 March when the ship commenced a three-month restricted availability at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. On 2 June 1965, Worden returned to San Diego for evaluation of a newly installed radar system. She continued to operate in her home port area and participated in Fleet Exercise \\"Range Bush\\" off the coast of southern California during the period 18 through 24 November 1965. She ended the year making preparations for deployment to the western Pacific. USS Worden, early in her career. The frigate departed her home port on 7 January 1966 for Subic Bay, Philippines, via Pearl Harbor and Guam. She arrived at the Philippines on 30 January and, the following day, set course for the Gulf of Tonkin and operations with the 7th Fleet. On 4 February, Worden assumed \\"Tomcat\\" duties west of Hainan Island. After an eight-day visit to Sasebo, Japan, Worden departed on 1 March and returned to the Gulf of Tonkin to assume plane-guard duties for the aircraft carrier . On 19 March, the frigate received a helicopter detachment on board; and, the following day, a rescue helicopter from Worden pulled a downed F-4 Phantom pilot from the water three miles from the beach. Another such rescue was effected on 23 May. Worden conducted operations in the Gulf of Tonkin until 17 June when she completed her commitment and proceeded to Yokosuka, Japan, for a short upkeep period prior to the return trip to California. The frigate arrived at San Diego, on 10 July. During the period 11 September to 21 October, the ship fired a series of missiles at the Pacific Missile Range, as part of a missile test project. As of 31 December 1966, Worden was moored at Naval Station San Diego, preparing for future operations involving the project. January 1967 was spent providing services for continued missile tests, and the frigate remained in port during February, training and preparing for an upcoming deployment. On 13 March, Worden took part in the second \\"Comtuex\\" of the year, then returned to San Diego. Worden began a six- month deployment to the western Pacific on 8 April when she sailed for Japan via Pearl Harbor. On 26 April, the frigate arrived at Yokosuka, Japan. May began with Worden en route to Subic Bay via the Okinawa missile range. On 14 May, the ship reached Danang, South Vietnam, and served on a search and rescue station until mid-September with intermittent periods of upkeep and liberty at Subic Bay, Hong Kong, Sasebo, and Yokosuka. During a visit to Hong Kong on 13 August, a Greek freighter lost control and rammed Worden on the starboard side inflicting minor damage. As the frigate departed Hong Kong for Subic Bay, she sighted and rescued a dugout canoe with three Philippine nationals who had been adrift for three days. On 14 September 1967, Worden departed the search and rescue station the last time for Yokosuka via Subic Bay. The ship departed Japan on 23 September for Pearl Harbor, thence to San Diego, arriving on 6 October. Worden remained in port until 16 November when she conducted local operations and type training. With the exception of a dependent's cruise and an off-load of ammunition at Seal Beach, Worden remained in port at San Diego for the month of December and thus ended the year. The early days of 1968 found Worden at San Diego, completing plans and preparations for yard overhaul, her first since commissioning. On 9 January, the frigate sailed to the San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard where she entered drydock. The major shipyard jobs were completed toward the middle of April. On 6 May, the ship began sea trials, and the overhaul was officially completed on 13 May 1968. Upon returning to San Diego two days later, Worden conducted various exercises and evaluations in preparation for an upcoming western Pacific deployment. On 1 July, the frigate commenced six weeks of refresher training. The ship spent the month of September conducting missile firings and antisubmarine warfare exercises. During the period 1 to 10 October, Worden joined in Exercise \\"Beat Cadence\\", a simulation of the Tonkin Gulf task organization. After a brief tender availability, Worden departed San Diego en route to Subic Bay, Philippines, via Pearl Harbor, arriving on 22 November. Three days later, the ship departed Subic Bay and became involved in a search and rescue (SAR) incident when a helicopter with nine Navy men on board ditched in the approach to the harbor. All of the men were rescued, and the helicopter was towed by boat to a nearby beach. underway replenishing with , 1986. Worden then steamed to Danang, South Vietnam, for SAR briefings and anti-PT boat exercises before assuming duties as commander of the task unit at the northern SAR station. The frigate shifted to the southern SAR station on 5 December and remained on station without incident until 29 December when relieved the ship. Worden then proceeded to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for an overnight logistics stop en route to Sasebo, Japan, for repairs. The New Year, 1969, found Worden en route to Sasebo, Japan. After stopping at Keelung, Taiwan; and Subic Bay, Philippines; the ship returned to the northern SAR station, Danang, South Vietnam, on 25 January 1969. She remained on station through 18 February when she departed for Subic Bay; then to Singapore and Hong Kong. The frigate returned to her station on 14 March for a week of service before departing the last time for Subic Bay, arriving on 23 March. For the remainder of the month, she conducted task group operations. Worden returned to Subic Bay on 4 April, then began a cruise which took her to Sydney (14 to 21 April); Wellington, New Zealand (25 to 27 April); and Pago Pago, American Samoa (1 May). The ship arrived at San Diego, on 8 June and conducted a Secretary of the Navy guest cruise and a material inspection through 30 June. The frigate conducted local operations throughout July and August. On 22 September, she set sail for Acapulco, then transited the Panama Canal. Wordens ultimate destination was Bath, Maine, where, on 10 November 1969, she was decommissioned at Bath Iron Works. =1970‚Äì1979= USS Worden and the Seattle skyline, 1986. The lengthy yard period which followed was the product of a Navy-wide program to enhance the anti-air warfare capability of all guided missile frigates which included the installation of the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) and two Terrier missile directors, (AN/SPG-55). Worden was recommissioned at the Bath Iron Works 18 months later on 16 January 1971. On 6 February, the ship departed for the transit to her new home port of Long Beach, California. After a period of refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and liberty at Acapulco, Worden arrived at Long Beach on 19 March 1971. During the next two months, the ship underwent an intensive training period off the southern California coast in connection with the modernization program. On 7 July 1971, the frigate entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an eight-week period of post-shakedown availability. The ship began preparations for her fourth overseas deployment beginning on 7 September following her departure from the shipyard. In late August, Worden crew members learned the ship was to be permanently assigned to the 7th Fleet with a home port change to Yokosuka, Japan. This major policy decision was designed to alleviate the burden of long family separations. Worden got underway on 20 October 1971 for her new home port. She stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor before arriving at Yokosuka on 11 November. During the last six weeks of the year, Worden conducted special operations in the Sea of Japan and enjoyed a month-long holiday rest. The frigate sailed from Yokosuka on 3 January 1972 for special operations in the Sea of Japan. Returning to Yokosuka on 17 January, the ship prepared for the first cruise in three years to the Gulf of Tonkin. These preparations took her to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and Subic Bay, Philippines. On 6 February, Worden left the Philippines and proceeded west to assume duties in the Gulf of Tonkin. The frigate operated on the northern SAR station, then moved closer to the North Vietnamese coast off Thanh Hoa until 11 March when she proceeded back to her home port, Yokosuka, Japan. After a month of operations off Japan and Okinawa in connection with amphibious Exercise \\"Golden Dragon\\", Worden moved south to help counter a North Vietnamese major offensive. She assumed duties as an escort for the carrier . The first major air strike on Haiphong since 1968 took place on 15 April. During the strike, Worden was damaged by two AGM-45 Shrike anti- radiation missiles inadvertently fired by United States support aircraft. One crew member was killed, and nine others were seriously injured; they were airlifted by helicopter to the amphibious assault ship for treatment. Worden proceeded to Subic Bay for a 10-day repair period. The frigate returned to the Gulf of Tonkin until 11 May and operated as an escort for the aircraft carrier . She took a break from 8 to 11 May and assumed a search and rescue station off Thanh Hoa during the first mine-laying strikes on North Vietnam. On 16 May 1972, Worden began a restricted availability at Yokosuka, Japan, followed by missile tests at Okinawa. On 20 June, she returned to duties at the southern SAR station, operating off Cape Mui Ron for the next month. After a brief visit to Yokosuka, Worden returned to the Gulf of Tonkin on 9 August and served as escort for the carriers and Kitty Hawk. Worden moved to the middle search and rescue station off Vinh on 1 October, then to the southern station shortly after. On 17 October, Worden departed for Hachinohe, Japan, and Navy Day festivities. The ship went into drydock at Yokosuka on 25 October for replacement of both propellers. Worden again returned to the Gulf of Tonkin on 18 November where she operated until 5 December. After a visit to Taiwan, the frigate finished out the year at Yokosuka, Japan, in a standdown period. Operations in the Gulf of Tonkin and in-port periods characterized Wordens employments during 1973. Support of Task Force (TF) 77 and TF 78 was interspersed with needed repair availabilities in Yokosuka, Japan, and Subic Bay, Philippines, and relaxing port visits to Hong Kong and Taiwan. On 28 January 1973, the Vietnam cease fire was announced, and Worden joined TF 78 at Subic Bay. During the sweeping of Haiphong harbor, she functioned as Rear Admiral Brian McCauley's flagship as well as the helicopter support platform, the repair and logistic facility for the minesweeping units, and task force antiair warfare and surface defense. For later operations, the frigate served on antiair picket station and as the Positive Identification and Radar Advisory Zone (PIRAZ) station. Besides the inherent responsibility for aircraft control and identification and air surveillance, Worden functioned as search and rescue asset coordinator and platform for the pre-positioned helicopter. After the combat and post-hostility period had ended, Worden began stressing new phases of operations: antisubmarine warfare and engineering readiness. The last underway period of the year, 30 November to 3 December, was spent conducting ship antisubmarine tactics with the destroyer and the submarine . Worden returned to Yokosuka to a Christmas holiday upkeep period and a rest from the activities of the past year. Wordens first exercise of the new year 1974 was \\"Aswex 3‚Äì74\\" (Taeknando III) with the Republic of Korea Navy, conducted from 14 to 17 January. After a brief return to Yokosuka, she participated in joint Exercise \\"Fly-A-Way\\" off Okinawa, returning to her home port on 8 February. The warship remained in Yokosuka until 25 February in upkeep status, then sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, for surface missile exercises. The missile exercises marked the first multi-ship missile exercise in the western Pacific of the post-Vietnam era. Worden followed these exercises with a port visit to Keelung, Taiwan, and tender availability at Sasebo, Japan. On 29 March, the frigate departed Sasebo for operations with Midway in the Sea of Japan. She also joined the destroyer in a search and rescue exercise simulating a North Korean surface unit. Worden returned to Yokosuka on 7 April to begin a lengthy upkeep period in preparation for her representation of the United States at the Shimoda Black Ship Festival on 15 May. On 10 May 1974, a major earthquake occurred on the Izu Peninsula causing extensive damage to the Shimoda area. As a result, the Black Ship Festival was cancelled, and Worden continued upkeep with a brief underway period for type training. The ship got underway on 25 May and joined Midway and the task group to conduct air operations in the Yokosuka and northern Japan operations areas. While underway, Worden joined the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force in joint Exercise \\"Aswex 5‚Äì74.\\" On 4 June, Worden was detached from Midway and proceeded independently to the Okinawa missile range to conduct missile firing tests followed by a port visit to Keelung, Taiwan. While in port, eight first class NROTC midshipmen embarked in Worden to participate in the six-week \\"Westpactramid 1‚Äì74.\\" On 27 June, Worden returned to Yokosuka to begin a short upkeep period to prepare for the American-Japanese midshipmen exchange cruise. The frigate sailed from Yokosuka on 17 July in company with Midway and the task group for air operations off northern Japan. After a brief stop in Yokosuka, Worden departed on 22 July for Kure, Japan, to participate in the midshipmen exchange cruise. The final phase of the cruise took place in port at Yokosuka on 30 and 31 July and included spirits and social events. Worden remained in Yokosuka until 2 August, when she sailed for task group operations along the northern coast of Japan. On 15 August, she began a period in port at Yokosuka and, in late August, sailed for the eastern Pacific, nearer the United States than she had been since deploying to the Pacific in October 1971. During this period, Worden remained in the company of a Soviet and Kynda II-class cruiser. USS Worden Mark 10 missile launcher and missile house for Terrier or RIM-67 Standard missiles. Worden departed the area on 4 September for Hong Kong, thence to Yokosuka, Japan. Upon arrival on 25 September, Worden underwent upkeep, then sailed to Sasebo to embark Japanese officers for training. Worden made rendezvous with Midway and conducted an operational readiness inspection en route to Yokosuka. Arriving in port on 11 October, the ship began an upkeep period and was drydocked on the 25th. Three days of underway training late in November signaled the approaching end of the upkeep period. Following a Thanksgiving celebration, the ship got underway for Manila, Philippines, arriving there on 4 December. Four days later, she joined Midway and steamed for northern Japan, conducting Operation \\"Command Diamond\\", a major Air Force and Navy exercise off Okinawa on 16 December. Worden arrived in Yokosuka on 19 December and entered a holiday period which closed the year 1974. The frigate departed the naval ship repair facility at Yokosuka on 13 January 1975 en route to Subic Bay, Philippines. During this two-week at-sea period, she conducted antiaircraft and antisubmarine warfare operations with Midway. The ship arrived on 27 January for a week at Subic Bav and participated in Operation \\"Readex\\" before returning to Yokosuka on 19 February.

To quote from the Ship's Command History, The hospitality and friendly reception was overwhelming. The \\"Dial a Sailor\\" lines were flooded with calls, the Chief Petty Officers were treated to a party at the naval base (HMAS Leeuwin) nearby. Fremantle put a big spread on for the crew, and the Wardroom (Officers) was treated to a cocktail party by the Australian- American Association of Fremantle at the Town Hall.

After changing her homeport to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Worden played a key role in the naval and air campaign in the first Gulf War. Soon after Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, Worden was tasked to deploy to the Middle East. Wordens combat capabilities had recently been updated with the New Threat Upgrade, a massive remodeling of the ship, from food service space rehabilitation to a main propulsion system overhaul and weapon system upgrades.GlobalSecurity.org.CG-16 Leahy class. Worden set sail for the Persian Gulf and upon arrival took over duties as anti air warfare commander in the northern Persian Gulf.

He is known more widely as the donor of stained glass windows to both Anglican churches and nonconformist chapels. He edited several medical books, authored poems and letters to newspapers, chaired baptist and related meetings, and gave lectures to Mechanics' Institutes and similar educational institutes in London and North Yorkshire. One of Dr Rogers' most sought-after public lectures in the late 1830s was a two-evening lecture on Mythology of the Ancients. This was given at the Southwark Literary Society, the Finsbury Institution for Sunday School Teachers and Senior Scholars, the Croydon Literary and Scientific Institution, the Scarborough Mechanics Institute, and the Stepney Meeting Sabbath Sunday School Institute. Nathaniel Rogers' first wife was Alice Dixon, daughter of the wealthy Charles Dixon; he married again in 1856 to Alice Casterton, widow of Henry Burnstead and daughter of William Casterton of Dalston. Amongst his philanthropic works were donations to restore the Pulteney Monument at Westminster Abbey, a stately monument of different coloured marble; and stained glass windows at St. Paul's Cathedral, Acton Parish church, the Abney Park Chapel, and Union Chapel, Islington. One of the Canons at St. Paul's described Rogers' window with considerable praise: there is a glorious light, as if shining in from the heavens. The two angels are standing as if midway between heaven and earth; and the disciples are standing in different attitudes below, gazing upwards. To my mind it surpasses all that have yet been taken up. This beautiful stained glass window, given by Dr Rogers, was made by a Munich firm. It was placed at the east end of St. Paul's Cathedral. Nathaniel Rogers' window at Acton Parish Church was also well received, being described at the time as a beautiful stained glass window... in the south side of the parish church. Unlike the window at St. Paul's, this was, however, a family tribute. It was donated in memory of his father and mother who had married in the church. The window represented 'Charity', its text reading Charity believeth all things, hopeth all things, and endureth all things. Rogers was, by faith, a Baptist, supporting their meetings and involvement in the non-denominational London Missionary Society. As missionaries, the Baptists were particularly strong in Jamaica. Shortly after the death of William Knibb he was invited to chair a meeting of the Malton Sunday School Baptists, when his support for Knibb and his Anti-slavery work became plain: We sympathise especially with our sable brethren in Jamaica; for great has been the loss in losing Knibb. To say that he was perfect would be to flatter humanity at the expense of truth... for perfection belongs not on earth but in heaven. Throughout his life, Nathaniel Rogers was interested in his family history, believing himself to be descended in some way from the Protestant martyr of the same name, John Rogers. Though he claimed such descent, it is unclear whether he uncovered any evidence. However, he funded the restoration of more recent ancestral memorials, such as to James Rogers of Dagenham, born in 1741. Rogers died in 1884 in Exmouth, aged 76. Twenty years before his death, he designed a small white marble temple of the Corinthian order with pedimented stone roof, at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington. Dr Rogers's Family Tomb it proclaimed, in an inscription over the iron grilled entrance gate. This was the only mausoleum ever permitted by the largely Congregational Board of the non-denominational cemetery, given their distinctly Puritan leanings against any such grandeur in death in their garden cemetery and stood on the principal axis between the Abney Park Chapel and historic gated entrance to Abney Park. Its paired windows were carefully positioned to permit the original axial vista to co-exist with the mausoleum, by way of a small north-south 'through-view'. The Rogers' mausoleum is now grade II listed by English Heritage. It is the resting place of Rev. Samuel Oughton and his wife, the Baptist pastor, missionary and reformer, as well as a number of other Rogers' family members.

On August 31, 2006, Al-Turki was sentenced to 28 years in prison on twelve felony counts of false imprisonment, unlawful sexual contact, theft and criminal extortion.Saudi Man Gets Prison Time in Housekeeper Slavery Case in Colorado, Fox News. August 31, 2006. On February 25, 2011, he was re-sentenced from 28 to eight years for his good behavior in prison. Al-Turki maintains his innocence and blames anti-Muslim sentiment for the charges that led to his 2006 conviction and sentence in a case that has strained relations between the U.S. and the Saudi government. Background Born and raised in Saudi Arabia, Homaidan Ali Al-Turki moved to the United States with his family in 1995, after receiving an academic scholarship from the Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh to pursue a PhD in linguistics from the University of Colorado at Boulder. After successfully earning a master's degree with honors, Al-Turki was completing a linguistics doctorate program at the University of Colorado, specializing in Arabic intonation and focus prosody. A father of five, Al-Turki and his wife Sarah Al-Khonaizan were active members of Denver's Muslim community. Additionally, Al-Turki operated Al-Basheer Publications and Translations, a well-known Arabic language translation and publishing house based in Aurora, Colorado. Arrest Legal problems for Homaidan Al-Turki and his wife began on November 18, 2004, when they were arrested with their Indonesian housekeeper by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents because of questions regarding his student visa validity. Al-Turki operated a publishing-translation business and authorities suspected it might violate student visa prohibitions of employment.Karen Abbott.Saudi man prevails in hearing on bail , Rocky Mountain News, July 29, 2005 Accusations against the couple by their housekeeper appeared while she was in police custody. In interviews with law officers, the woman claimed she suffered four-years of captivity, exploitation and abuse at the hands of the Al-Turki family. =Bail hearing= On July 29, 2005, Colorado U.S. District Judge Walker Miller overruled a magistrate who declared Al-Turki a flight risk, allowing release while charges against him are pending if $400,000 cash bail is posted. The entire $400,000 must be deposited to guarantee appearance at future court proceedings. Defense attorney John Richilano contacted Al-Turki's brother in Saudi Arabia with news of Miller's ruling. The brother, who is a doctor, said the family would help raise money. Defense attorney Dan Recht estimated the couple's total cost of freedom while charges are pending was $1 million, including: Al-Turki's $400,000 bail in Arapahoe County District Court, provided by the Saudi government: $400,000 in federal court: $25,000 to $50,000 bond to immigration court: and his wife's $150,000 bail. An FBI agent working the case testified that Al-Turki borrowed over $200,000 for his business from three friends who attended his mosque but had repaid only about $53,000 of it. Miller further ordered that Al-Turki be placed on electronic monitoring, avoid all potential witnesses in the case except his wife, remain in Colorado and not seek deportation through the U.S. immigration agency. District Court trial Arapahoe County District Court initiated criminal trial proceedings against Homaidan Al-Turki and Sarah Khonaizan on February 16, 2006, with the defendants both entering not-guilty pleas. Prosecutor Ann Tomsic began the state's case by explaining how the couple brought the young Indonesian woman to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia to work as a housekeeper when she was a teenager. The affidavit states her domestic services included child care, cooking, and cleaning for 12-hours a day, seven days a week without time-off from 2000 to 2004. While not working, she was confined to an unheated basement and repeatedly sexually assaulted by Homaidan Al-Turki. Tomsic added that the woman was allowed out of the house alone only to remove trash, bring in mail and clean the yard. Prosecutors claimed the couple intentionally created a climate of fear and intimidation through aggravated sexual abuse, which was intended to cause the victim to believe disobedience would result in serious harm. The couple also allegedly threatened the victim with abuse of law and the legal process, confiscating her Indonesian passport and visa for the purpose of obtaining labor for little or no pay. =Defense argument= Defense attorney John Richilano argued the federal government only filed fraudulent sex-slave charges after failing to make a terrorism case against Al-Turki. They claimed Mr. Al-Turki was under FBI-investigation on possible terrorism links before his arrest. Federal court documents filed by the defense show that the Denver Joint Terrorism Task Force had Al-Turki under a \\"full fledge investigation\\" suspecting \\"he is closely aligned to terrorists and may be providing material support to terrorism.\\" Evidence also indicated a federal investigation of proceeds from Al-Basheer Publications. They highlighted an incident from April 2005 in Illinois, when state police stopped Al-Turki on Interstate 80 near LaSalle. A message on the national crime information computer warned the officers \\"terrorist organization member - caution, do not alert this individual to this notice.\\" His lawyers claim school documents in his car were removed, copied and faxed by the Illinois State Police to the Denver FBI. The U.S. Attorney's Office responded by maintaining that the terrorism investigation was totally unrelated to the victims allegations.Rick Sallinger, Saudi in Aurora For Possible Terror Link , CBS Denver, October 22, 2005 =Cultural bias argument= A strategy utilized by the defense contended that Turki's Arabian cultural norms are alien to most Westerners, and hence, vulnerable to prejudice and cultural bias. For example, court documents filed by Al-Turki's lawyers illustrated that \\"there are Saudi Arabian customs regarding a host family's retention of funds for their domestic servant until she leaves their service.\\" In his testimony, Al-Turki denied any wrongdoing and said authorities had targeted him because of his religion. He insisted that the woman was treated the same way any observant Muslim family would treat their daughter and defended his actions to District Judge Justin Mark Hannen, saying that: However, Prosecution lawyer Natalie Decker adamantly contested the accuracy of this statement, stressing that the trial proceedings had nothing to do with the defendants beliefs or ethnicity and instead \\"has to do with what he did to her (the maid) for five years\\" and that Mr. Al-Turki's actions represented \\"a clear-cut example of human trafficking.\\" The prosecution also pointed out that the alleged victim, the Indonesian maid, is also a Muslim. Responding to rising accusations of cultural bias, prosecution attorney Ann Tomsic requested that Judge Hannen should strive to treat Al-Turki as he would any American citizen who committed similar crimes. Tomsic further emphasized that \\"the world is listening, and the court needs to make a statement that in the United States, or at least in...(Colorado), this kind of slavery will not be tolerated.\\"Barbara Ferguson & Samir Al-Saadi, Turki Blames Anti-Muslim Sentiment in US, Arab News. September 2, 2006 =Conviction and sentencing= After two and a half weeks, Homaidan Ali Al-Turki's criminal trial concluded on June 30, 2006. In the end, a jury of citizens from Arapahoe County convicted him on twelve felony counts of unlawful sexual contact with force, one felony count of theft of services over $15,000, and two misdemeanor counts of false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit false imprisonment. On August 31, 2006, he received a sentence of twenty-eight years-to-life in state prison by Judge Mark Hannen. =Appeal attempts= On January 22, 2009, it was announced that the Colorado Court of Appeals upheld Homaidan Al-Turki's conviction, ruling that the trial court correctly set certain limits during jury selection and that the jury's findings were supported by evidence.Colorado Court Upholds Conviction of Saudi Arabian Man, KRDO.com, January 26, 2009 Following the decision, family spokesman Fahd Al-Nasar, announced to the Saudi Gazette that six American law firms had been retained and they planned to appeal the verdict with the Colorado Supreme Court. Nasar added he was surprised to hear the Appeal decision only two weeks after the initial hearing, since he assumed this type of case required a minimum of at least four to six weeks. The Al-Turki family indicated they were hopeful that diplomatic efforts from the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C. would assist in influencing the legal outcome.Turki‚Äôs case to be taken to Colorado Supreme Court , Saudi Gazette. January 2009 Post-conviction After reaching an agreement with prosecutors, Al-Turki's wife, Sarah Khonaizan, pleaded guilty to reduced charges in both state and federal courts. She was sentenced to home detention and probation in the federal case and two months in jail for the state case. On September 1, 2006, she was transferred to the custody of federal immigration officials and according to her attorney, Forrest Lewis, she agreed to not fight deportation proceedings.Suthers reassures Saudis:Feds back Suthers' trip to explain case of captive nanny, Rocky Mountain News Sarah arrived in Riyadh on September 22, 2006, with her two children and immediately issued a press statement, signed by Hamad Al-Khonaizan, Sarah's brother, blaming anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S. for Al-Turki's prosecution. According to the statement, the primary factor behind her husband's imprisonment was his successful efforts at preaching Islamic dawah. After the state conviction, federal charges of forced labor, document servitude and harboring an illegal immigrant were dropped. In its motion, the U.S. Attorney's office said that dropping the federal charges was done in hopes of sparing the victim from having to testify again about \\"the most intimate personal matters.\\"\\"Sex-slave case apparently over: Prosecutors ask to drop federal charges against Saudi man\\" Rocky Mountain News, September 8, 2006 Judge Walker D. Miller added the U.S. attorney's decision to drop federal charges was \\"in no way a statement regarding the strength of the government's case.\\"Sarah Burnett, Sex-slave case apparently over, Rocky Mountain News, September 8, 2006 While incarcerated, Mr. Al-Turki claims he was offered a bargain-deal by U.S. authorities which included deportation to Saudi Arabia and employment as an undercover FBI operative. In a video interview posted on YouTube, Al-Turki states he is being mistreated in prison as well as his wife, who he further contends had her hijab (head scarf) forcibly removed from her head during the trial. According to cultural norms in Saudi Arabia, the removal of a woman's head scarf is considered an extreme insult. Fact as stated to the US Supreme Court Statement of facts from United States Supreme Court Brief, references are to volume and page numbers in the actual trial transcript: =Statement of the Case and Facts= In June 1999, Mr. Al-Turki and his wife/co-Defendant [Sarah Khonaizan] brought Z.A., a 17-year-old Muslim girl from a village in Indonesia, to Saudi Arabia to work for them as a domestic servant at a salary of 600 Saudi riyals (approximately $150) per month (Record 18:60-61, 71-75, 99-100, 102). In September 2000, the Al-Turkis brought Z.A. to the U.S. (Record 18:124). She was admitted to stay until March 9, 2001, as a \\"personal or domestic employee.\\" The Al-Turkis kept Z.A.'s passport but failed to renew it, while repeatedly warning her that if she left them she would be arrested (Record 21:28). They also strictly controlled her communications, disallowing her to write letters to her friends (Record 21:80; 22:49; 23:28, 132-134). Mr. Al-Turki misrepresented Z.A.'s visa status and employment situation to his friends (Record 25:88-89, 262, 307). He also falsely told his secretary at his bookstore that Z.A. was married to a driver in Saudi Arabia (Record 25:184-85). Z.A. was instructed to say that her salary was $800 per month(Record 18:122). In August 2004, she was told that if she was contacted by authorities she should tell them that she had two days off every week, and that her salary was sent to Indonesia (Record 21:73-74,99). On November 18, 2004, following FBI investigations of Mr. Al-Turki, Z.A. was arrested for overstaying her permit. Mr. Al-Turki and his wife were also arrested for harboring an illegal alien. Initially, Z.A. told authorities what she had been instructed to say by the Al-Turkis regarding her employment situation. Eventually, however, she told the truth, including the fact that she had been paid only $1500 during her entire stay in the United States. She also revealed that Defendant had sexually abused her on a regular basis. [Based on minimum wage, the value of Z.A.'s services during the last three years of her work for the Al-Turkis was $96,044.92 (Env. #6, People's Exh.87a 5162).] At trial, Z.A. provided a detailed account of Mr. Al-Turki's sexual misconduct. According to her, about once every two weeks, Mr. Al-Turki would go to her room in the basement at night and sexually molest her, including digitally penetrating her and forcing her to perform oral sex on him (Record 19:21-22, 26, 65, 97, 99, 102; 21:41). During the last incident of sexual abuse, which occurred approximately two weeks before Z.A.'s arrest, Mr. Al- Turki, for the first time, had sexual intercourse with Z.A., who was still a virgin (Record 21:44-46). Afterwards, Z.A. confronted Mr. Al-Turki with a blood-stained tissue, expressing fear that she would become pregnant (Record 21:45). Three days later, Mr. Al-Turki told Z.A. not to worry, that he would not have sexual intercourse with her again, and that she should tell him if she missed her period (Record 21:48). Z.A. kept a diary describing Mr. Al- Turki's sexual abuses. However, prior to Z.A.'s arrest, Mr. Al-Turki told her to destroy it, which she did (Record 21:75-76; 23:109-10). Two married Muslim women described Mr. Al-Turki's similar acts of sexual misconduct against them, including touching their genitalia and breasts (Record 24:160-71, 180-99). Mr. Al-Turki's theory of defense, which is repeated in his petition, was that Z.A., under pressure from the FBI and motivated by the desire to get authorization to stay and work in the U.S., had fabricated the allegations (Record 18:44, 50-51, 53-55; Env. #8, Instruction 32). However, Z.A. had disclosed Mr. Al-Turki's abusive conduct to a friend of hers, a Mr. Al- Resheid, more than a year before any contact with the authorities (Record 19:105-06) . [ Mr. Al-Resheid, a subpoenaed witness for the prosecution, left the U.S. on August 16, 2005, and never returned (Record 20:52-54).] Z.A. never asked for assistance to stay in the U.S. (Record 25:171). Moreover, under the 2000 Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, Z.A. automatically qualified for \\"continued presence\\" status, which allowed her to stay and work in the U.S. (Record 25:119-20, 122,125-26), and the process to establish her \\"continued presence\\" status started long before she revealed the sexual abuse (Record 25:125). Finally, the FBI agent who helped Z.A. with filling out her necessary forms signed them on April 4, 2005, three days before her revelation (Record Env. #7, Deft's Exhs. E, F; 25:172-88). Mr. Al-Turki was convicted of false imprisonment, conspiracy to commit false imprisonment, felony unlawful sexual contact (12 counts), criminal extortion, and theft (Record 4: 872-99). He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 20 years to life for the unlawful sexual contacts, an eight-year consecutive term for theft, and shorter terms on the remaining charges to run concurrently with the theft sentence (Record 4:901-02; 5:1250-55; 29:73-76; Supp. Record 31-34). On appeal, Mr. Al-Turki challenged his convictions on various grounds. In an unpublished opinion, the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed Mr. Al-Turki's convictions. People v. Al- Turki, 06CA2104,January 22, 2009 (Petition, App. 1a-29a). The Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari review. Al-Turki v. People, 2009 WL 2916999 (Colo. No. 09SC326, September 14, 2009) (Petition App. 30a-31a). On April 5, 2010, the United States Supreme Court denied Mr. Al-Turki's Petition for Certiorari. International reaction The Homaidan Al-Turki case sparked controversy and high-profile attention from Muslims worldwide, particularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where local media portrayed him as a victim of bias against Muslims and said he would not have been convicted of these crimes had he been tried in his native country. For example, in a show of support, the Saudi government provided Al-Turki with $400,000 to post bond. In November 2006, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers travelled to Saudi Arabia where he visited King Abdullah, Crown Prince Sultan, and Al-Turki's family in an attempt to clear up \\"misperceptions\\" about the U.S. judicial system and ease the Saudi royal family's concerns over whether Homaidan Al-Turki was treated fairly.Carlos Illescas, Saudi king hears Aurora sex-slave case. Denver Post, November 18, 2006 Suthers went there at the request of the U.S. ambassador in Saudi Arabia, who had the State Department contact Colorado Governor Bill Owens. The trip was sponsored and paid for by the U.S. State Department. Even years after the case was closed, the issue continues to arouse powerful emotions in Saudi Arabia and affect the delicate balance of Saudi-US foreign relations. Saleh Bin-Humaid, chairman of the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia (Shoura Council), brought up Al-Turki's case during an official meeting with the US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff in Riyadh on March 26, 2009, when he urged Americans to review the topic. According to a public statement from Bin-Humaid, \\"The Saudi people sympathize with Homaidan Al-Turki and they closely follow up his case.\\" Further proceedings =Reduction of sentence= After a hearing before District Judge J. Mark Hannen in the Colorado District Court in Arapahoe County on February 25, 2011 Al-Turki's sentence was reduced to 8 years to life, making him eligible for parole soon. The Court cited his good behavior in prison. The hearing was granted due to a decision in another case which held that excessive minimum sentences had been imposed on some sex-offenders. A letter from the Saudi ambassador to the United States was considered by the court. Parole may be conditioned on Al- Turki's progress in the prison system's rehabilitation programs for sex- offenders. =Denial of request to serve remainder in home country= On March 12, 2013, Al-Turki's request to be sent to his home country to serve out his sentence was denied by the Colorado Department of Corrections on the grounds that state law requires sex offenders to undergo treatment while in prison and that al-Turki had declined to participate. The assassination of Colorado Department of Corrections executive director Tom Clements at his residence in Monument, Colorado on March 20, 2013 prompted attention to the case of Al- Turki. On March 21, 2013, the Department of Corrections announced that Homaidan al-Turki had been moved into an isolation cell for his own protection. On March 22, 2013, Evan Spencer Ebel, a prison parolee, was connected as the probable suspect in Clements' shooting after he was killed in a shootout with police in Decatur, Wise County, northern Texas. The Northeast Denver Islamic Center Imam Abdur-Rahim Ali objected to the media attention on Al-Turki in the ongoing investigation into Clements' murder.

Definition  Let A be a commutative ring with an ideal I. A divided power structure (or PD-structure, after the French puissances divis√©es) on I is a collection of maps \\\\gamma_n : I \\\\to I for n = 0, 1, 2, ... such that: #\\\\gamma_0(x) = 1 and \\\\gamma_1(x) = x for x \\\\in I, while \\\\gamma_n(x) \\\\in I for n > 0. #\\\\gamma_n(x + y) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\gamma_{n-i}(x) \\\\gamma_i(y) for x, y \\\\in I. #\\\\gamma_n(\\\\lambda x) = \\\\lambda^n \\\\gamma_n(x) for \\\\lambda \\\\in A, x \\\\in I. #\\\\gamma_m(x) \\\\gamma_n(x) = ((m, n)) \\\\gamma_{m+n}(x) for x \\\\in I, where ((m, n)) = \\\\frac{(m+n)!}{m! n!} is an integer. #\\\\gamma_n(\\\\gamma_m(x)) = C_{n, m} \\\\gamma_{mn}(x) for x \\\\in I, where C_{n, m} = \\\\frac{(mn)!}{(m!)^n n!} is an integer. For convenience of notation, \\\\gamma_n(x) is often written as x^{[n]} when it is clear what divided power structure is meant. The term divided power ideal refers to an ideal with a given divided power structure, and divided power ring refers to a ring with a given ideal with divided power structure. Homomorphisms of divided power algebras are ring homomorphisms that respects the divided power structure on its source and target.  Examples  *The free divided power algebra over \\\\Z on one generator: ::\\\\Z\\\\langle{x}\\\\rangle:=\\\\Z\\\\left [x,\\\\tfrac{x^2}{2},\\\\ldots,\\\\tfrac{x^n}{n!},\\\\ldots \\\\right]\\\\subset \\\\Q[x]. * If A is an algebra over \\\\Q, then every ideal I has a unique divided power structure where \\\\gamma_n(x) = \\\\tfrac{1}{n!} \\\\cdot x^n.The uniqueness follows from the easily verified fact that in general, x^n = n! \\\\gamma_n(x). Indeed, this is the example which motivates the definition in the first place. * If M is an A-module, let S^\\\\bullet M denote the symmetric algebra of M over A. Then its dual (S^\\\\bullet M)^\\\\vee = \\\\text{Hom}_A(S^\\\\bullet M, A) has a canonical structure of divided power ring. In fact, it is canonically isomorphic to a natural completion of \\\\Gamma_A(\\\\check{M}) (see below) if M has finite rank. Constructions If A is any ring, there exists a divided power ring :A \\\\langle x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\rangle consisting of divided power polynomials in the variables :x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n, that is sums of divided power monomials of the form :c x_1^{[i_1]} x_2^{[i_2]} \\\\cdots x_n^{[i_n]} with c \\\\in A. Here the divided power ideal is the set of divided power polynomials with constant coefficient 0. More generally, if M is an A-module, there is a universal A-algebra, called :\\\\Gamma_A(M), with PD ideal :\\\\Gamma_+(M) and an A-linear map :M \\\\to \\\\Gamma_+(M). (The case of divided power polynomials is the special case in which M is a free module over A of finite rank.) If I is any ideal of a ring A, there is a universal construction which extends A with divided powers of elements of I to get a divided power envelope of I in A.  Applications  The divided power envelope is a fundamental tool in the theory of PD differential operators and crystalline cohomology, where it is used to overcome technical difficulties which arise in positive characteristic. The divided power functor is used in the construction of co-Schur functors.

The hotel is owned and managed by Maybourne Hotel Group, which also owns Claridge's and The Connaught in Mayfair, London. History =1800s and early 1900s= Located on the corner of Piccadilly and Berkeley Street, it was the base for drivers of mail coaches travelling to the West Country and hence named the Gloucester coffee house. As a result, it started to expand and became a hotel for travellers both to and from London who were travelling on the mail coach services. With the coming of the railways, in 1897 the building was formally renamed The Berkeley Hotel, a location trusted by the parents of debutantes to keep an eye on the reputation of their daughters. In 1900, Richard D'Oyly Carte bought the hotel, and his family remained in control for the next century. In the 1920s The Berkeley became one of the first London hotels with air conditioning, and in the 1930s double glazing. Ferraro, the maitre d'hotel of the Berkeley Grill, was a fixture of London nightlife in the 1920s and 1930s and appears in several novels of the period, such as Dennis Wheatley's Three Inquisitive People, written 1932 but not published till 1940. He also is mentioned in P. G. Wodehouse‚Äôs 1931 novel, ‚ÄòBig Money‚Äô, some of which takes place at the Berkeley. =Late 1900s and 2000s= In 1972, the hotel moved to a new building designed by British architect Brian O'Rorke on Wilton Place, Knightsbridge. Incorporating restored features from the original building, it is also unique in that it boasts London's only rooftop swimming pool. Although the Savoy Hotel in the Strand also has pool open to the sky, that pool is located in an atrium on the third floor. In the winter months Health Club & Spa transforms its roof-top terrace into a pine-filled forest cinema. Hotel guests and visitors alike are treated to winter classics on the big screen while nestling between warm down-feather Moncler blankets and hot water bottles. In 2005, The Savoy Group, including The Berkeley, was sold to a group of Irish investors. The sale of The Savoy Group, led to the Savoy Hotel and Savoy Theatre being sold off and renamed as the Maybourne Hotel Group.Walsh, Dominic. \\"Savoy Group changes name after deal\\", The Times, 25 January 2005 Recently released plans for developments at The Berkeley show that the swimming pool on the roof will be closed and a new spa will be opened Bamford Hay Barn Spa, and additional rooms will be added to the roof area. Restaurants and bars In 1998, Pierre Koffmann moved his Michelin starred \\"La Tante Claire\\" from the area of Chelsea to the hotel, serving his signature dish of pig's trotter stuffed with morel mushrooms. The original Chelsea site was taken over by Gordon Ramsay, who opened the signature Restaurant Gordon Ramsay there. Replaced at the hotel in 2003 by the Gordon Ramsay-run \\"Boxwood Caf√©\\", after its closure Koffmann returned in April 2010 to open the signature \\"Koffmann's\\" restaurant at the hotel. Koffmann's at The Berkeley closed on 31 December 2016. Marcus Wareing heads the Michelin 1 star-rated \\"Marcus\\", which in 2010 replaced Gordon Ramsay's Michelin-starred P√©trus restaurant. The Collins Room is home to the Pret a Portea, and serves afternoon tea. The Blue Bar was designed by Dublin architect David Collins, and is decorated entirely in Lutyens Blue, a colour he created in honour of Edwin Lutyens.http://www.independent.ie/travel/travel-destinations/weekend-away- berkeley-hotel-london-1385947.html In 2004, an album entitled The Blue Bar was released through Warner Dance, featuring a mix of ambient techno and electronica regularly played in the bar.
