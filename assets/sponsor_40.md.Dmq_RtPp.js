The lake is located on the east side of Lake Village, Arkansas in Chicot County. It is not only the largest oxbow lake in North America, but the largest natural lake in Arkansas, formed 300 years ago by the meandering of the Mississippi River. The name Chicot, French for \\"stumpy,\\" refers to the many cypress stumps and trees along the lake banks. The lake is approximately wide and long from end to end, forming a traditional \\"C\\" shape (when viewed from overhead, with top being north and bottom being south and the open end of the \\"C\\" facing east). The Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism operates Lake Chicot State Park on the northern end of the lake, Chicot County also operates a county park on the eastern side of the lake across from Lake Village. Located at the State Park are a bait shop, fish cleaning station, and pier. The bait shop also has boat rentals. At the state park visitors' center, there are cabins for rent and camping spots. There is also a wildlife museum, featuring creatures found in and around Lake Chicot. Activities Fishing In 1968 the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Chicot County Rural Development Authority began to restore Lake Chicot to its original state. When the dam at Cornerly Bayou was destroyed in a flood in 1927, silt and mud came pouring into the southern end of the lake. The pollution of the southern part of the lake eventually killed off the bass population. The upper part of the lake was protected by a dam, so it remained clean and protected. The groups decided to drain the water off the polluted section of the lake to compress sediment on the bottom, and plant vegetation that would provide a stable environment for fish species. The southern part of Lake Chicot was restocked, and has become a flourishing ecosystem. Fish species that can be caught in the lake include: Bluegills, channel catfish, largemouth bass, hybrid striper bass, crappie, redear sunfish, and bream. Boating Chicot State Park provides a very good marina for people to launch their boats. The park, which is located on the northern part of the lake, also provides boat rentals. If you do not own a boat, you can rent a 15-foot bass boat with a 9.9 HP motor. Fishing and Camping gear can easily be found at the State Park's store. A couple other popular boat launches include: Jack R. Rhodes Lake Front Park in downtown Lake Village and the Chicot County Park. Lake Chicot State Park There are 122 campsites and 14 cabins located in Lake Chicot State Park. They meet the needs of large gatherings with indoor pavilions. This park is positioned right in the path of the Mississippi Flyway, so it naturally provides an amazing bird watching opportunity. A fun activity to do at the park is hiking. The Delta Woodlands Trail is 1 mile long and classified as easy. It is surrounded by bottomland hardwoods, and squirrels love to play in the pecan trees around the trail. Birds and colorful flowers thrive throughout the bountiful area.  Physical geography  In the 1820s the land around Lake Chicot(also known as \\"Old River Lake\\") began to be filled with American settlers. Cotton farms worked by slaves were very common in the land surrounding the lake. A cotton plantation, on the shores on Lake Chicot, was named Sunnyside Plantation. It was created in the 1830s, and became the home of an Italian immigrant colony. In the mid 1800s Chicot County's population was 9,234, and of that number 7,512 were slaves. The biggest Civil War battle in Chicot County was fought on June 6, 1864 on the shores of Lake Chicot. In the Battle at Ditch Bayou, Union and Confederate soldiers engaged in battle on the southern shore of the lake. The Union eventually won the battle. By moving the Confederates out of the Mississippi River, travel became much safer and easier. This was considered one of Arkansas' final Civil War battles.

It features eleven electric blues songs that were recorded from March 1966 to June 1967, throughout five different sessions. King played with two in-house bands: Booker T. & the M.G.'s and the Memphis Horns. Although the album failed to reach any music chart, it did receive positive reviews and is now regarded by critics as one of the greatest blues albums ever made. The guitar play on Born Under a Bad Sign influenced many guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Born Under a Bad Sign was inducted into both the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2012, it was ranked at number 491 on Rolling Stone list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Recording and music In 1966, King signed with the Memphis-based label Stax Records. The 43-year-old musician had already recorded music for other labels, but outside of his 1961 song \\"Don't Throw Your Love on Me So Strong\\", he had yet to find any commercial success. Throughout five sessions from March 1966 to June 1967, King recorded several songs at Stax Studios with two in-house bands: Booker T. & the M.G.'s and the Memphis Horns. Although Jim Stewart is credited as the producer, trumpeter Wayne Jackson said Steve Cropper and Al Jackson Jr. ran the recording sessions. Many of the songs recorded during these sessions were released as singles, and in August 1967, the singles were compiled and released as King's debut album with Stax, titled Born Under a Bad Sign. Born Under a Bad Sign is an electric blues album, with influences of soul and funk. The album's music comprises simple chord progressions, which Jackson noted was due to inexperience. \\"We didn't know how to play it any better!\\" said Jackson. King played primarily on the three highest guitar strings and only used a select few phrases throughout the album. In the liner notes for the 2002 reissue of Born Under a Bad Sign, critic Michael Point wrote how King was able to distinguish his guitar play despite only using a few phrases: \\"His simple but subtle reconfigurations were accomplished through inflections, emphasis, and timing, not via sprinting through scales.\\" The sharp guitar sound heard throughout the album can be partially attributed to King's unorthodox style of play. King was left-handed, but chose to play a right-handed Gibson Flying V and not restring it. King pulled strings from above instead of pushing from below, the standard string bending technique. As a result, he was able to bend several strings simultaneously, which allowed for multi-timbral phrasing. When asked about King's style of play, Jackson said: \\"Albert's guitar was always out of tune with everything else, but he was such a strong man he would just bend the notes back in!\\" Side one of Born Under a Bad Sign features six short songs, which are all under three minutes long. Side two features longer, more ballad-like songs. \\"Personal Manager\\" in particular contains one of the few guitar solos on the album. Arguably the most famous song from Born Under a Bad Sign is the album's title track, which was written by William Bell and Booker T. Jones. Bell wanted to write a song about astrology and came up with an unconventional ten-bar guitar line (as opposed to eight-bar and twelve-bar blues) during a jam session. Music historian Rob Bowman called \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" \\"one of the most smokingly intense blues recordings of the modern era\\". Release and reception Born Under a Bad Sign was released in August 1967 by Stax Records. It failed to reach any music chart, although three songs from the album‚Äî\\"Laundromat Blues\\" (1966), \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", and \\"Crosscut Saw\\" (both 1967)‚Äîdid reach the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart. Rob Bowman believes this was because the rhythm and blues market emphasized 45 rpm singles as opposed to albums. A critic from Billboard magazine awarded the album a \\"Special Merit Pick\\" label, and wrote: \\"Albert King has a way with the blues, a realistic, soulful style which hits the mark as all 11 cuts in his latest Stax album demonstrate.\\" Born Under a Bad Sign was reissued in 2013 by Stax and Concord Records. The reissue features remastered versions of every song from the original release, as well as four alternative versions, one untitled instrumental piece, and additional liner notes. Neil Kelly of PopMatters felt the additional song were enough to warrant a repurchase, and highlighted the instrumental piece. Kelly said: \\"Booker T and the MG's never sounded better, even on a one-off jam that was never supposed to be issued.\\" =Legacy= Decades after its release, Born Under a Bad Sign status continues to grow, and it is now considered one of the greatest blues albums ever made. The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide gave Born Under a Bad Sign a perfect score, where author David McGee described it as \\"a blues monument\\". Leland Rucker echoed McGee's remark in the MusicHound Blues: The Essential Album Guide book, writing \\"King's Stax debut Born Under a Bad Sign is an undisputed classic.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic highlighted the musicianship between King and the M.G.'s, and wrote: \\"it's astounding how strong this catalog of songs is\\". Erlwine noted how influential the guitar play on the album was. \\"[King] unleashed a torrent of blistering guitar runs that were profoundly influential, not just in blues, but in rock & roll\\". Journalist Sean McDevitt agreed with this statement, and wrote \\"Born Under a Bad Sign directly influenced legions of guitar players who studied its every subtlety and nuance\\". Among these guitarists are Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, most of whom covered songs from Born Under a Bad Sign. Clapton's band Cream sampled the guitar solo from \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" for the song \\"Strange Brew\\", and covered \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" for their 1968 album Wheels of Fire. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band also covered \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" for the 1967 album The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw. Born Under a Bad Sign has been recognized by several music institutions as an influential album. It has been inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame, in 1985 and 1999 respectively. The 2002 reissue received a Blues Music Award for \\"Historical Blues Album of the Year\\". In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked Born Under a Bad Sign at number 491 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The list states: \\"King's first album for the Stax label combines his hard, unflashy guitar playing with the sleek sound of the label's house band, Booker T. and the MG's.\\" Michael Point believes Born Under a Bad Sign was critical to the modernization of blues music, and catapulted King into mainstream popularity. King went from playing on the Chitlin' Circuit as a relatively unknown musician, to large rock arenas such as the Fillmore and Fillmore East. These performances attracted both black and white audience members, including a large following of hippie fans. Track listing Track listing taken from the 1967 vinyl release of Born Under a Bad Sign.

He is the chairman emeritus, former chairman and CEO of the Nestl√© Group, and former chairman of Formula One. Early life Brabeck-Letmathe was born in Villach, Austria, into a family with its origins in Iserlohn-Letmathe in north-western Germany. He studied economics at the University of World Trade (today Vienna University of Economics and Business). Early career at Nestl√© He joined Nestl√© in 1968 in Austria as a salesman, later becoming a specialist for new products. His career within the group included a span of almost 10 years in Chile (1970‚Äì1980), first as national sales manager and later as director of marketing. In 1981, he was appointed managing director of Nestl√© Ecuador and in 1983, president and managing director of Nestl√© Venezuela. In October 1987, he was transferred to Nestl√©'s international headquarters in Vevey. As senior vice-president in charge of the Culinary Products Division, he had worldwide responsibility for that business area. On 1 January 1992, Brabeck-Letmathe was appointed executive vice-president of Nestl√© S.A., with global responsibility for the Strategic Business Group encompassing food, Buitoni pasta, chocolate and confectionery, ice cream, pet food, as well as industrial products (aromas). At the same time, he had worldwide responsibility for marketing, communications and public affairs. In particular, during his time as executive vice-president, he conceived and implemented the unique branding policy of Nestl√©, characterized by a strict hierarchy of strategic brands on the global, regional and local level. CEO of Nestl√© On 5 June 1997, he was elected to the board of directors, and appointed chief executive officer of Nestl√© S.A. On 6 April 2001, the board of directors elected him as vice-chairman, and in April 2005, chairman of the board.

Retrieved 23 March 2011 Views on water charges Brabeck-Letmathe (credited as Peter Brabeck) appeared in the 2005 documentary We Feed the World and while speaking on the subject of water, he said \\"It's a question of whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population. And there are two different opinions on the matter. The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That's an extreme solution. The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value.\\" He added, \\"Personally, I believe it's better to give a foodstuff a value so that we're all aware it has its price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water.\\" Following controversy on social media about these remarks, he stated that he does believe that water for basic hygiene and drinking is indeed a human right. He went on to say that his remarks were intended to address overconsumption by some while others suffered from lack of water and further that his remarks were taken out of context by the documentary.\\"Addressing the Water Challenge\\" Other responsibilities Brabeck-Letmathe was on the board of directors of Credit Suisse Group, L'Or√©al, and ExxonMobil.

The R√∂mer is located opposite the Old St. Nicholas church and has been the city hall (Rathaus) of Frankfurt for over 600 years. The R√∂mer merchant family sold it together with a second building, the Goldener Schwan (Golden Swan), to the city council on March 11, 1405 and it was converted for use as the city hall. The Haus R√∂mer is actually the middle building of a set of three located in the R√∂merberg plaza. The R√∂mer is not a museum as it is occasionally used by the city for various purposes, for example as a Standesamt or civil registration office; the wedding rooms are located in the first and second floor of the Haus L√∂wenstein. The former old town quarter between the R√∂mer and St. Bartholomew's Cathedral will be redeveloped as the Dom-R√∂mer Quarter until 2016, including several reconstructions of historical buildings that were destroyed during World War II. Extensions The building complex has been continuously extended over the years, with eventually eleven houses connected to each other, resulting in a rather confusing interior. At the beginning of the 19th century, Frankfurt historian Anton Kirschner remarked that the Frankfurt city hall had \\"stairs, yards, halls and rooms in a labyrinthian mixture\\". In 1435, the city bought the Frauenrode house, in 1510 the Viole house and in 1542 the Schwarzenfels house, which were all architecturally connected to the main complex. Then, in 1596 the city council bought the Wanebach house, which stood next to the Goldener Schwan, as well as the building to the left of the Haus R√∂mer, the Haus L√∂wenstein, and had both of them connected to the R√∂mer. These construction projects were very complicated, since the floor heights of L√∂wenstein and R√∂mer were radically different. Seufzerbr√ºcke In 1843, the Frauenstein house and the Salzhaus were added. Finally, in 1878 the city bought the Alt-Limpurg house to the right of the Haus R√∂mer for 214,000 marks. The current neogothic front with a balcony was built from 189 more imposing, but mayor Franz Adickes decided against Kaiser Wilhelm's suggestion and had the front designed in a more welcoming manner. At the same time, the houses Frauenrode and Viole were demolished to make way for streets through the city centre. They were replaced by a newly erected building to the east. This new building is divided into two wings by the Braubachstrasse. These two wings (the north wing and south wing) are connected by a bridge. The Frankfurt citizens, who paid their taxes in the north wing, named the covered bridge the Seufzerbr√ºcke (the \\"Bridge of Sighs\\") in reference to the other Bridge of Sighs in Venice. The two towers in the south wing attracted nicknames as well: the larger one was called Langer Franz (Tall Franz) in homage to the city's tall mayor and the smaller one the Kleiner Cohen (Small Cohen) after a popular song of the time. On the night of March 22, 1944, the R√∂mer, along with the rest of the centre of Frankfurt, was largely destroyed in one of the heaviest Allied bombing attacks of the Second World War. When the building was rebuilt after the war, the Alt-Limpurg, the R√∂mer, and the L√∂wenstein houses, whose roof structure had in part withstood the attack, were restored in a simplified form. The completely destroyed houses Frauenstein and Salzhaus were rebuilt in a simplified style. The L√∂wenstein house has an open stairwell. The R√∂mer was re-inaugurated in 1955 by president Theodor Heuss. This wall relief was added when the R√∂mer was rebuilt The balcony Entrance of the R√∂merhalle, 1553 In the following decades the fa√ßade was restored two additional times, in the years 1974 and 2005, and the houses on the R√∂merberg regained the neogothic look of 1900. The interior has also been redesigned. In 1988 the renovated city council meeting hall was completed. Architecture The entire three-storey building complex occupies about 10,000 square metres and consists of nine houses, encircling six courtyards. The front, with today's main entrance, faces the R√∂merberg plaza. Other streets around the R√∂mer are the Limpurgergasse to the south and the Buchgasse and the Berliner Stra√üe to the north. The Braubachstra√üe divides the south and north wings. =Fa√ßade= The exterior features of the set of buildings reflect a wide breadth of Frankfurt and Germany's history, even though they were designed at the beginning of the 20th century. The famous three-peaked fa√ßade has medieval elements of design. The left-hand corner of the Alt-Limpurg displays the so-called Frankfurtia, the female embodiment of the city. In the middle, the Haus R√∂mer shows the four kaisers of the Holy Roman Empire, two city coats of arms, a clock face, and a placard describing the most important facts about the building. The four kaisers are Frederick Barbarossa (the first king to be elected in Frankfurt), Louis the Bavarian (who gave convention rights to the city and allowed an expansion of the city), Charles IV (who made Frankfurt the location of the Kaiser selection vote), and Maximilian II (the first kaiser to be crowned in Frankfurt cathedral). Like the neogothic fa√ßade, the balcony was added after the rebuilding in 1900, replacing a wooden roof. The balcony was and is used as a public stage for state visits and sporting events - for example, the soccer world champions in the Women's World Cup in 2003 and the runners up in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Another approach was chosen for the design of the fronts of the two north-east houses (the Wanebach and the Salzhaus). In contrast to the other houses in the complex, instead of reconstructing the old Wilhelminean front, the architects created a completely new design using a combination of medieval timber framing and modern styles. The mosaics in the timber frames feature the motif of a phoenix, a symbol for modern Frankfurt's new start after the war. =Rooms=R√∂merhalle and Schwanenhalle These two halls are the oldest remaining rooms in the building and are virtually unchanged after 600 years. At one point, the first Frankfurt book fairs took place in these rooms and gold and silversmiths sold their merchandise there. After the Second World War, the rooms continued to be used for this purpose because the massively built structures had survived the war practically undamaged. The two halls are located on the ground floor of the houses R√∂mer and Goldener Schwan, and they can be entered directly from the main entrance on the R√∂merberg. Kaisersaal Perhaps the best-known room of the R√∂mer, the Kaisersaal, or Emperor Hall, is located above the R√∂merhalle on the second floor and is a major tourist attraction. During the Holy Roman Empire, coronation banquets took place there. Today, the Kaisersaal is well known for its unique and unparalleled collection of 19th century portraits of all of the emperors, including works by Eduard Von Steinle of Albert I and Ferdinand III.

Biography Arnold was born at Annaberg, in Saxony (Germany), where his father was schoolmaster. In 1682 he went to the Gymnasium at Gera, and three years later to the University of Wittenberg. He made a special study of theology and history, and afterwards, through the influence of Philip Jacob Spener, the father of pietism, became tutor in Quedlinburg. His first work, Die Erste Liebe zu Christo, appeared in 1696. It went through five editions before 1728, and gained the author a high reputation. In the year after its publication he was invited to Gie√üen as professor of church history. He disliked academic politics and academic life so much that he resigned in 1698, and returned to Wittenberg. The next year he began to publish his largest work, his Unparteyische Kirchen- und Ketzer-historie (‚ÄúImpartial History of the Church and of Heresy,‚Äù Frankfurt, 1699‚Äì1700), two hefty volumes in which some thought he showed more sympathy towards heresy than towards any established Church, or especially the clergy (cf. Otto Pfleiderer, Development of Theology, p. 277). This book is described by Tolstoy (The Kingdom of God Is Within You, chap, iii.) as ‚Äúremarkable, although little known.‚Äù In this major revision of church history, Arnold directed his sharpest criticism against those who wrote deeply biased apologetic ‚Äúorthodox‚Äù histories instead of trying to understand where substantial religious differences actually came from. In his view, ‚Äúheresy making‚Äù was usually the defensive reaction of those in authority, rather than a true indictment of unconventional thinkers. He thought that the worst calamity in Church history was its establishment as the accepted and orthodox faith by the Roman Emperor Constantine in the fourth century. Arnold evinced a remarkable sympathy for a huge variety of ‚Äúheretics.‚Äù This ‚Äúimpartial history‚Äù exercised a wide influence on the German Enlightenment and won approval from such thinkers as Johann Wolfgang Goethe in addition to Leo Tolstoy. His next work, Geheimniss der g√∂ttlichen Sophia, showed that he had developed a form of mysticism including a female image of wisdom (sophia) as a kind of divinity. Soon afterwards, however, his marriage and his acceptance of a pastorate marked a sharp change of views, and he produced a number of noteworthy works on practical theology. He was a thoroughly learned and prominent Pietist Lutheran, with a wide range of influence, and at least in his early career a radical Pietist, vehemently opposed to the unbending ecclesiastical structures of his time. His sacred poems also made a substantial contribution to the treasury of hymns within the Lutheran church, and a poem of his was used by Johann Sebastian Bach (‚ÄúVergiss mein nicht,‚Äù BWV 505).

He takes the two- man space shuttle, leaving 625 alone and helps H√§msterviel escape from prison. Stitch is then assigned to recapture H√§msterviel. H√§msterviel and Gantu burst into Jumba's lab and force Jumba to create an evil twin of Stitch, Leroy, to defeat the Galactic Alliance. Stitch arrives and after a fight, he is defeated when Pleakley appears at an inopportune moment, distracting Stitch long enough for Leroy to lock him in a glass capsule. H√§msterviel reveals his plans to clone an army of Leroys to take over the Galactic Alliance. Before leaving for Turo, H√§msterviel locks Jumba, Pleakley and Stitch in Pleakley's ship, and sends the vessel into a black hole. On Earth, Lilo decides to contact Stitch. Lilo realizes that the only intergalactic videophone on the planet available is in Gantu's ship. There, she finds 625 and asks to use the videophone. However, 625 says it is broken. Lilo then names 625 \\"Reuben\\". He thereafter consents to help Lilo. Once the videophone is fixed, Lilo contacts the BRB-9000. Leroy impersonates Stitch, using shape-shifting to disguise himself, but fails because he does not have Stitch's tiki necklace. H√§msterviel then commands Leroy to go to Earth and capture all of the other experiments to destroy them. Lilo, sensing Stitch is in trouble, asks Reuben for help in fixing Gantu's ship. As Jumba, Pleakley, and Stitch head towards the black hole, Stitch escapes and frees the others. However, the navigational computer is locked on course for the black hole and will teleport them to a volcanic planet where they will be vaporized, but if they can disrupt the event horizon by throwing a small object into the black hole, it will send them somewhere else. Pleakley pulls out the rock that Lilo gave him and asks if this will work. After Jumba says it is too heavy, Stitch takes a bite out of it, then crawls out the front of the vehicle and throws it at the black hole. There is a flash and the vehicle is sucked in. On Earth, a Leroy clone obtains Lilo's scrapbook of \\"cousins\\" and quickly captures all of them (including Mertle). Lilo and Reuben arrive at Turo, but they are too late; H√§msterviel has taken over, making the Grand Councilwoman his receptionist, and orders Gantu to lock them up. Gantu imprisons Lilo and Reuben, but decides to release them after H√§msterviel fires him. After a close call with several Leroy clones, they are trapped. All is lost until the G.A.C.C. van suddenly appears. With no time to explain, Lilo, Reuben and Gantu all climb in and head for Earth. On Earth, the original Leroy has herded all the experiments into a large stadium where \\"Alohapalooza\\" is about to take place. The BRB-9000 appears and H√§msterviel prepares to obliterate all of the experiments, until a timely appearance by Lilo, Stitch and the others and destroy the BRB's primary cannon. H√§msterviel reveals that he brought along his Leroy army as backup. Stitch rallies his \\"cousins\\" and the battle begins. Despite some initial victories by the experiments, it soon becomes apparent that the adversaries are better than them. Jumba remembers that he programmed a secret shutdown command into Leroy: if he plays Elvis Presley's \\"Aloha 'Oe\\", the others will deactivate. Stitch appears on-stage in his Elvis attire and plays \\"Aloha 'Oe\\" with Lilo and Reuben accompanying him, causing the Leroys to have violent seizures and shut down. With his plan foiled again, H√§msterviel is recaptured and sent back to prison. Back at the Galactic Alliance HQ, they are proclaimed \\"Heroes of the Alliance\\". Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley ask to be allowed to return to Earth with Lilo. The Grand Councilwoman grants this and asks Gantu if he would like to be reinstated as the Captain of the Armada. Gantu agrees on the condition that Reuben be assigned as his galley officer. Back on Earth, Lilo sets up for one last picture. Mertle arrives with Gigi (during the battle, Mertle was with Gigi and was astounded when she found that Gigi was able to talk, being one of Jumba's experiments). Lilo's last picture in the album is of all of the experiments still on Earth, Mertle, Jumba, Pleakley, Nani, David and herself. Meanwhile, Leroy and all of his clones, who have recovered from their seizures, are dancing to the song \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" (H√§msterviel angrily taps his foot to the beat). As the credits roll, a full list of Jumba's experiments 001 through 626, and the names they were given by Lilo (and other characters in some instances during Lilo & Stitch: The Series), scrolls along the left side of the screen.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 40% based on 5 reviews. Skyler Miller of AllMovie gave the film a rating of 3¬Ω out of 5 stars, praising the voice acting, Elvis Presley songs, and \\"[the] fast-moving plot that mixes frenetic action, sentimentality, and a few laughs.\\" Miller wrote, \\"While [Leroy & Stitch is] not nearly as engaging or emotionally rich as the original [Lilo & Stitch] film that inspired it [...] all in all, Leroy & Stitch is a fitting wrap-up to an enjoyable animated series.\\" CinemaBlend.com gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 stars, stating the film is \\"just another direct-to-video sequel of Disney with no unusual stuff in it,\\" and further uplifted and preferred the original film. The website Common Sense Media (CSM) gave the film's quality 4 out of 5 stars and applicable for ages 5 above based on 10 reviews from both parents and children. In 2019, Petrana Radulovic of Polygon ranked Leroy & Stitch ninth out of twenty-six films on her list of direct-to-video sequels, prequels, and \\"mid-quels\\" to Disney animated films, one rank higher than Stitch! The Movie. Despite criticizing Leroy & Stitch for focusing more on the aliens and space over the \\"charming\\" characters like with Stitch! The Movie, she ranked the finale film higher than the pilot film because of all the now-united 626 experiments' \\"wacky and really specific powers\\", stating that \\"[w]e get to see what they've all been up to after acclimating to life on Hawaii[...], and see them in action in the final battle.\\" In a similar list in 2020, Lisa Wehrstedt of Insider ranked Leroy & Stitch seventh out of twenty-five films on her list. Werhstedt wrote, \\"For fans who were really involved with the series [...], this film acts like the perfect finale.\\" However, she also criticized it for \\"los[ing] a bit of the human charm of the original and the previous [released] sequel.\\" Soundtrack Lilo & Stitch Hawaiian Album is the soundtrack to Disney's Leroy & Stitch. The majority of the Leroy & Stitch soundtrack are Elvis Presley records, while other parts of the soundtrack include music inspired by Gustav Holst's \\"The Planets\\". The soundtrack also contains score pieces from the original Lilo & Stitch film (which was composed by Alan Silvestri) and from Lilo & Stitch: The Series's pilot film Stitch! The Movie (which was composed by Michael Tavera, who was also the composer for The Series). =Track listing=See also * How to Train Your Dragon, a 2010 DreamWorks Animation film also written and directed by creators Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois * Lilo & Stitch: The Series, an animated television spin-off of the animated feature film Lilo & Stitch that preceded Leroy & Stitch * Walt Disney Television Animation NotesReferencesExternal links  * * Leroy & Stitch at Keyframe - the Animation Resource Category:2006 films Category:2006 animated films Category:2006 direct-to-video films Category:2006 television films Category:2000s American animated films Category:American animated television films Category:American buddy films Category:American children's animated comic science fiction films Category:American films Category:American sequel films Category:Animated buddy films Category:Disney television films Category:Disney direct-to-video animated films Category:Films about children Category:Films about cloning Category:Films based on television series Category:Films set in Hawaii Category:Lilo & Stitch Category:Disney Television Animation films ","title":"Leroy &amp; Stitch"},{"id":"2280079","title":"Official names of the Soviet Union"},{"id":"2280082","text":"The Independent Grouping for Reflection (, GIR) was a political party in the Central African Republic.

Around 1821, under the pseudonym of \\"Nimrod\\", Apperley began to contribute a series of articles to The Sporting Magazine that covered horse races, hunt meets and other sporting events. His references to the personalities of the people he knew or met at such events helped to double the circulation of the magazine within a few years.

Created by Namco's Project Soul division, he first appeared in Soul Edge, later appearing in both console and arcade versions of Soulcalibur III, as well as on various merchandise related to the series. He is voiced in Japanese by Jin Yamanoi in Soul Edge and Masaya Takatsuka in Soulcalibur III. Li Long is an assassin, who failed in a mission to kill the leader of a Japanese pirate faction. Taken in by an innkeeper and his daughter, he fell in love with the girl only for her to be apparently killed. Desiring revenge, he battles wandering swordsmen and steals their weapons, while searching for the cursed sword Soul Edge. After being severely beaten by its wielder and now on the run pursued by assassins sent by his former employer, he reflects on who he is with doubt, until he meets a woman reminding him of his lost love. Reinvigorated, Li Long now searches to discover who he is. As a character, Li Long was positively received, and described as \\"the most dramatic\\" of the characters in Soul Edge. His replacement by another character later in the series, Maxi, has been criticized by the media, with several sources stating a preference for him. Conception and creation Several character concepts were considered before deciding to design Li Long as a polite young man As a character introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long's weapon, a pair of nunchaku with mounted blades, were selected before other elements of the character. One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development, they were designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game. Li Long's design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, many ideas were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts. Another idea considered was for him to fight using kung fu, instead of solely with his nunchaku. Due to a ban of nunchaku weapons in the United Kingdom, his weapon was changed to a three-section staff for European releases of Soul Blade, with a section of staff replacing the chain in terms of appearance. Li Long was initially considered for inclusion for Soulcalibur, however the developers instead decided to focus on creating a new character using the same weapon for the title, resulting in Maxi. Later, due to the character's popularity, Li Long was selected to be included in home and arcade versions of Soulcalibur III. In an interview, Soulcalibur IV director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated many fans had requested for the character to reappear in the series, though added no plans had been made to release the character as downloadable content for the title. =Design= In Soul Edge, Li Long appears as a tall, Asian male with his brown hair tied in a knot atop his head with long, thick sideburns. His facial contours, expressions and hairdo were designed to be sharp, intended to suggest the \\"assassin\\" side of his character, as well as imply the image of Chinese culture in the character. A large light brown jacket with green trimming covers his arms, while a large belt wraps around his midsection. Dark brown pants ending in white trimming cover his legs, and blue and white stripped shoes cover his feet. His alternate character model varies significantly, featuring a shaved head, blue and gray vest with an open collar, small gold belt, green pants, and blue and red striped shoes. Li Long stands tall. When considering his appearance for Soulcalibur, different designs were considered, including one with a heavily bandaged eye and scarred appearance intended to imply his fate at the end of Soul Edge, and another modeled after his appearance in Soul Edges opening sequence, featuring a wide-brimmed hat, though both designs were rejected as the developers felt they made the character appear too thin. Elements from both were reused for Soulcalibur III, retaining the hat while giving his left eye a damaged appearance. Elements of his previous design were retained, with the addition of a green vest and bracers, and the lengthening of the tail of his coat to his mid-thighs. His alternate character model from Soul Edge was added as his alternate in the game, featuring minimal changes save for opening the vest to have his chest be bare. In video games Introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long is an assassin sent by the Emperor of China to kill a pirate lord, but failed. Badly injured, he was rescued by a fugitive female ninja named Chie and eventually fell in love with her. One day, her former comrades pursuing Chie caught up with them and she was believed to be dead. Told falsely the swordsman Heishir≈ç Mitsurugi was responsible, he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade. Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats, repurposing some for his own use. Upon finding and defeating him, he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie, and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge. He located its wielder, Cervantes, but was beaten severely. Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye, he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his Chie's former clan leader. Traveling by night under a false name, he was taken in by a girl that reminded him of Chie. When the assassins eventually found him, Li Long stood his ground and defeated them. Remembering the feel of fighting for something other than revenge, he set out to find himself, not knowing that Chie was actually alive and, after giving birth to their son, had set out to find him. =Gameplay= Li Long's fighting style in Soul Edge has been described as accessible to novices of the game, while also usable by experienced players. His Reverse Scales attack consists of three swift horizontal attacks one after another, while his Flaming Fangs attack is similar, only vertical, requiring opponents to guard the attacks differently. Other attacks also consist of variations of existing moves with a different conclusion, such as his Combined Wind and Sand-Dust attacks, which both give similar visible cues but with the latter ending in a lower strike. Others moves such as Violent Cannon make use of feints, appearing to attack from one angle but striking from another. In Soulcalibur III, Li Long represents the game's \\"nunchaku\\" fighting style available to player-created characters through the game's character creation mode. Though the style utilized several elements from Maxi, many elements were altered, including attack commands, stance, and a separate series of weapons. With the character's inclusion in the arcade edition of Soulcalibur III, alterations were made to further define Li Long's fighting style as unique, modifying several attacks to utilize two nunchaku simultaneously as a result.  Promotion and reception  In addition to artwork, many promotional items for Soul Edge featured Li Long's likeness, including toys, window shades and table coasters. A two-page promotional comic was also released by Namco for the character, featuring Mitsurugi attempting to assist him in winning Chie's heart. In a 2002 poll by Namco prior to the release of Soulcalibur II regarding their favorite character from the series, Li Long placed last, part of a three-way tie with 1% of the poll's results. MAXIMUM, on the other hand, described him as \\"one of the most dramatic characters in the game\\", citing visible similarity to actor Bruce Lee's use of nunchaku. Retronauts in their retrospective of the series cited Li Long as an aspect of Soul Edge not included in later titles they missed. Comparisons have been drawn between the character and later series character Maxi, with sources such as 1UP.com stating preference for the former. GameDaily staff writer Eugene Huang shared the sentiment while naming him as one of his favorite characters, describing his attacks as \\"focused around efficacy and efficiency\\" and praising the character as having a compelling backstory.

It is the successor to the Psion Series 3 and a light version of Psion 5mx. It is software-compatible with the 5mx and has the same processor but is more lightweight (200 g vs 354 g of 5mx) and substantially smaller (157 √ó 79 √ó 17 mm). In comparison with the Series 5/5mx, the Revo has a smaller screen (480 √ó 160 vs 640 √ó 240 of Series 5/5mx) and also lacks a flash-card slot and a backlight. The Psion Revo comes in two main variants, Psion Revo and Psion Revo Plus, having 8 and 16 MB of RAM respectively. It is powered by a 36 MHz ARM 710T microprocessor. Among other things, the hardware is equipped with a short-distance IrDA wireless infrared communication system and a touchscreen. Like its bigger counterpart Series 5mx, it comes with a small suite of office and communications programs built into the ROM chips. Other programs are user-installable by using a \\"dock\\" to send Revo programs from a PC. SONICblue produced a rebadged version of the Psion Revo Plus called the Diamond Mako, which they distributed in the United States and in Canada. Along with Enfour, Psion produced two versions of the Revo for the Chinese market called the 618C (Traditional Chinese) and 618S (Simplified Chinese). An open-source project OpenPsion, formerly PsiLinux, aims to port Linux to the Psion Revo and other Psion PDAs. See the OpenPsion site or the site of Revol, which is an optimized version of OpenPsion for the Revo. Conan Shortly before the demise of Psion in the commercial PDA market work had begun on a successor to the Revo, a 3rd-generation PDA known by its codename of Conan. The Conan ran Epoc Release 6 and was to feature support for Bluetooth and a backlight, although the former wasn't functional in the development builds.A photo report of the Psion Conan.

Unlike the Series 5mx, which used 2 user- replaceable AA batteries, the Revo is powered by 2 built-in rechargeable AAA 700 mAh NiMH batteries, which typically need to be replaced after about 3 years of service. After backing up all data, the batteries can be accessed by closing the unit, peeling off the Revo logo (using a screwdriver or similar if necessary), moving the 2 small pins that are behind it, and lifting up the silver part of the casing. The batteries are wrapped in black tape, which can be removed starting from the left, taking care not to break the thermistor that it also encloses. It may not be possible to separate the batteries from their connectors without damaging the latter, which would then need to be replaced. Injury could result if separation is attempted with a blade. Replacement batteries must be taped in just as securely, otherwise resets could occur due to intermittent power loss. After replacing, the unit should be charged uninterrupted for at least 6 hours, so that the hardware can re- calibrate (as per instructions for a new unit).

History of development  The original PC Tools package was first developed as a suite of utilities for DOS, released for retail in 1985 for $39.95., PC TOOLS, AT LAST! Powerful disk utilities from the people who brought you Copy II PC, InfoWorld, September 2, 1985 With the introduction of version 4.0, the name was changed to PC Tools Deluxe, and the primary interface became a colorful graphical shell (previously the shell resembled PC BOSS and was monochrome.) By version 7.0 of the package in 1991 several Windows programs had been added to it. Though the 7.0 version sold well, it was criticised in computer trade publications for being overcomplicated and riddled with bugs. It was widely considered to have been rushed to publication, despite the objections of many of Central Point Software's employees. PC Tools PRO (Version 9) for DOS was the last stable version released by Central Point Software before acquisition. In June 1994 Central Point was acquired by their top competitor Symantec. The package MORE PC Tools was released by Symantec's Central Point Division in October 1994, Symantec, Vertisoft ship system utilities, InfoWorld, October 31, 1994 and included additional utilities: Backtrack, CrashGuard Pro (ex-Central Point Recuperator), DriveCheck, DriveSpeed. After that the product line was ultimately discontinued. PC Tools was the main competitor to Norton Utilities, which Symantec had acquired in 1990. Symantec now uses the PC Tools brand name --acquired from an Australian security vendor in 2008PC World, Symantec buys PC Tools--for low-cost antivirus and antispyware softwarepctools.com The PC Tools brand was retired on December 4, 2013 and the website now refers visitors to products in Symantec's Norton product line.  Utilities included  * PC Shell ‚Äî a file manager, capable amongst other things of displaying the contents of data files used by various popular database, word-processor, and spreadsheet packages * PC-Cache ‚Äî a licensed disk cache of HyperCache from the HyperDisk Speed Kit * PC-Secure - a file encryption utility * Central Point Anti-Virus -- an antivirus program. * Central Point Backup ‚Äî a backup utility for archiving and restoring data to and from disc or tape. In earlier releases, this utility was officially named \\"PC Backup\\". Innovative features included compression during backup and floppy disk spanning, and optional use of the Central Point Option Board for 33% faster disk writing. * DiskFix ‚Äî a utility for repairing on-disc file system data structures of a disc volume * DiskEdit ‚Äî a Disk editor * Unformat ‚Äî a utility that attempts to reverse the effects of a high-level format of a disc volume * Undelete ‚Äî a utility that attempts to recover a deleted file * Mirror ‚Äî a tool for storing the File Allocation Table to permit recovery of high-level formatted disks in combination with Unformat * Compress ‚Äî a disc volume defragmentation utility * FileFix ‚Äî a utility for repairing corruption to the data files used by various popular database, wordprocessor, and spreadsheet packages * Commute ‚Äî a remote control utility * VDefend ‚Äî a memory-resident computer virus detection utility * SysInfo ‚Äî a system information utility, incorporating diagnostics from 1993 onwards. The diagnostics were licensed from the Eurosoft product Pc-Check * Central Point Desktop (CPS) ‚Äî an alternative Windows desktop shell, supporting nested icon groups, file manager, resource monitoring dashboard, virtual desktops, launch menus and many other featuresA short review of CP Desktop for Windows The Mirror, Undelete, and Unformat utilities were licensed by Central Point to Microsoft for inclusion in MS-DOS 5.0.

Having studied at the universities of Munich and Erlangen, he was apprenticed to the law in the Bavarian State service (1846‚Äì49). He next (1849‚Äì50) studied languages and literature at Bonn, and in 1851 was appointed professor of aesthetics and of the history of literature at Vienna. In 1852, however, he gave up this post and retired to his estate of Schellenberg, near Kaiserslautern. The pious sentimentality of his romantic epic Amaranth (1849; 42nd ed., 1898) had already gained him enthusiastic admirers, and this work was followed, in 1850, by M√§rchen and by Gedichte (1852) and the tragedy Sieglinde (1854). He next settled on his estates near Kronach, and here wrote the tragedy Thomas Morus (1856), the historical dramas Philippine Welser (1859) and Der Zunftmeister von N√ºrnberg (1860), of which the first two met with great success. Elected member of the Bavarian Second Chamber for the district in which he lived, he removed to Munich in 1862. In 1868 he published the novel Hermann Stark, deutsches Leben, and in 1871 Das Lied vom neuen deutschen Reich (\\"Song of the New German Reich\\", which contains several hundred patriotic sonnets). In 1872 he took up his residence at Meran, but passed the last years of his life at a sanatorium for nervous disorders near Bayreuth, where he died on 6 July 1891.

Floer's first pivotal contribution was a solution of a special case of Arnold's conjecture on fixed points of a symplectomorphism. Because of his work on Arnold's conjecture and his development of instanton homology, he achieved wide recognition and was invited as a plenary speaker for the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Kyoto in August 1990. He received a Sloan Fellowship in 1989. Life He was an undergraduate student at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum and received a Diplom in mathematics in 1982. He then went to the University of California, Berkeley and undertook Ph.D. work on monopoles on 3-manifolds, under the supervision of Clifford Taubes; but he did not complete it when interrupted by his obligatory alternative service in Germany. He received his PhD (Dr. phil.) at Bochum in 1984, under the supervision of Eduard Zehnder. In 1988 he became an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley and was promoted to Full Professor of Mathematics in 1990. From 1990 he was Professor of Mathematics at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, until his suicide in 1991. Quotes \\"Andreas Floer's life was tragically interrupted, but his mathematical visions and striking contributions have provided powerful methods which are being applied to problems which seemed to be intractable only a few years ago.\\" Simon Donaldson wrote: \\"The concept of Floer homology is one of the most striking developments in differential geometry over the past 20 years. ... The ideas have led to great advances in the areas of low- dimensional topology and symplectic geometry and are intimately related to developments in Quantum Field Theory\\" and \\"the full richness of Floer's theory is only beginning to be explored\\". \\"Since its introduction by Andreas Floer in the late nineteen eighties, Floer theory has had a tremendous influence on many branches of mathematics including geometry, topology and dynamical systems. The development of new Floer theoretic tools continues at a remarkable pace and underlies many of the recent breakthroughs in these diverse fields.\\" Selected publications *Floer, Andreas.

These magazines are targeted to gay and bisexual men, although they may also have some female readers, and may include male-male and occasionally male-male-female content and/or male-female content. Such publications provide photographs or other illustrations of nudity and sexual activities, including oral sex, anal sex, and other various forms of such activities. These magazines primarily serve to stimulate sexual thoughts and emotions. Some magazines are very general in their variety of illustrations, while others may be more specific and focus on particular activities or fetishes. Prior to the 1970s, gay pornography was not widely distributed due to censorship laws. Non-pornographic \\"beefcake magazines\\" were widely available, and were generally purchased by gay men. From the late 1980s, a number of gay magazines and newspapers featured homoerotic nude or partially clothed male models but were not classified as pornography, for example Gay Times and QX Magazine.

Biography=Comic books= Grant has a long history scripting for both major publishers such as Marvel Comics and DC Comics, as well as smaller companies such as First Comics and Dark Horse Comics. Beginning in the early 1980s, Grant wrote a number of works for Marvel. In addition to bringing the Punisher back into the forefront of the Marvel Universe after a several-year lull, Grant has written The Avengers, The Incredible Hulk, and fill-in runs on comics such as What If?, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and Marvel Team-Up. Grant wrote a conclusion to Steve Gerber's Omega the Unknown series in two issues of The Defenders at the end of which most of the original series' characters were killed. While Gerber seemed unhappy with Grant's conclusion, it nevertheless tied up the loose ends of the comic series. In 1982, Grant, Mark Gruenwald, and Bill Mantlo co-wrote Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions,DeFalco, Tom \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 208: \\"Plotted by Mark Gruenwald, Steven Grant, and Bill Mantlo, and penciled by John Romita Jr., Contest of Champions eventually saw print in June 1982\\" the first limited series published by Marvel Comics. Grant and artist Mike Zeck produced a Punisher limited series in 1986 and an original hardcover graphic novel of the character three years later. Grant's creator-owned character, the female ninja Whisper, debuted at Capital Comics in 1983, though the company's publishing arm folded after only two issues and a promotional poster of the series were published. Several months after First Comics picked up two other Capital publications (Nexus and the Badger), they published a one-shot entitled Whisper Special which led to Whisper being featured in the anthology series First Adventures and eventually to her own ongoing series in June 1986. During this time, Grant wrote American Flagg!, he was personally selected by Howard Chaykin to take over scripting the title after Chaykin's departure, a fill-in run on Shatter, a short-lived comic book of his own creation called Psychoblast and a few issues of Classics Illustrated at First. At Dark Horse Comics, Grant wrote several limited and ongoing series in the short-lived Dark Horse shared superhero continuity, including the entire two- year run of the series X. His creation Enemy, published by Dark Horse, was optioned and produced as a Fox pilot, but ultimately did not air. He wrote numerous stories for DC Comics in the 1990s and created new versions of Manhunter and the Challengers of the Unknown. He continued to periodically write for Marvel Comics, his last major contribution being X-Man in collaboration with Warren Ellis and Ariel Olivetti. Among his other creator- owned works of the 1990s were the superhero comic Edge, with Gil Kane, published by Malibu Comics/Bravura, and the crime series Damned with Mike Zeck, published by WildStorm. His two long-running columns exposing the inner workings of the comics industry, \\"Master of the Obvious\\" and \\"Permanent Damage\\", ran from 1999‚Äì2010 at the Comic Book Resources website. Since 2005, Grant has written several works for IDW Publishing including original comics featuring the characters from the television show CSI. He wrote a one-shot featuring an updated version of his character Whisper and created a crime series, 2 Guns, about undercover cops, for Boom! Studios. At Avatar Press, he produced two creator-owned mini-series, Mortal Souls and My Flesh Is Cool, as well as adapted Frank Miller's original Robocop screenplays to comics format, which deviated considerably from the filmed versions. =Novels= In addition to comic book work, Grant has written a number of Hardy Boys novels for young adults under the pen-name Franklin W. Dixon, as well as Tom Swift, Race Against Time, and various \\"choose-your-own-adventure\\" type books, a posthumous collaboration with science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. =Film= Grant's 2 Guns has been made into a major motion picture from Universal Studios starring Denzel Washington, Mark Wahlberg, Bill Paxton and Paula Patton.

The Seven Valleys follows the structure of the Persian poem The Conference of the Birds. The Four Valleys ( Chah√°r V√°d√≠) was also written by Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the two books are usually published together under the title The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys. The two books are distinctly different and have no direct relation. In February 2019 an authorized translation of both titles was published by the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre in the collection The Call of the Divine Beloved.BWNS. A collection of Baha ºu'll√°h's mystical writings published. 6 February 2019.  Seven Valleys  The Seven Valleys was written around 1860 in Baghdad after Bah√° ºu'll√°h had returned from the Sulaymaniyah region in Iraqi Kurdistan where he spent two years anonymously with various Sufi sheikhs using the pseudonym Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. The work was written in response to questions posed by Shaykh Muhyi'd-Din, a judge, who was a follower of the Q√°dir√≠yyih Order of Sufism. About the time of writing to Bah√° ºu'll√°h, he quit his job, and spent the rest of his life wandering around Iraqi Kurdistan. This work has been called by Shoghi Effendi Bah√° ºu'll√°h's \\"greatest mystical composition\\", and in the West was one of the earliest available books of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, first translated directly to French in 1905, and English in 1906.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° explained in one of his talks that The Seven Valleys is a guide for human conduct, that one should search out one's \\"own imperfections and not think of the imperfections of anybody else\\", to \\"strive to be free from imperfections\\" and that \\"nothing is more fruitful for man than the knowledge of his own shortcomings\\".Savi 2008. The style of The Seven Valleys is highly poetic, though not composed in verse. Nearly every line of the text contains rhymes and plays on words, which can be lost in translation. As the recipient was of Sufi origin, Bah√° ºu'll√°h used historical and religious subtleties which sometimes used only one or a few words to refer to Qur ºanic verses, traditions, and well-known poems. In English, frequent footnotes are used to convey certain background information. The book follows the path of the soul on a spiritual journey passing through different stages, from this world to other realms which are closer to God, as first described by the 12th Century Sufi poet Farid al-Din Attar in his Conference of the Birds. Bah√° ºu'll√°h in the work explains the meanings and the significance of the seven stages. In the introduction, Bah√° ºu'll√°h says \\"Some have called these Seven Valleys, and others, Seven Cities.\\" The stages are accomplished in order, and the goal of the journey is to follow \\"the Right Path\\", \\"abandon the drop of life and come to the sea of the Life-Bestower\\", and \\"gaze on the Beloved\\". In the conclusion of the book, he mentions: :\\"These journeys have no visible ending in the world of time, but the severed wayfarer‚Äîif invisible confirmation descend upon him and the Guardian of the Cause assist him‚Äîmay cross these seven stages in seven steps, nay rather in seven breaths, nay rather in a single breath, if God will and desire it.\\" =The Valley of Search= The valley of search is described as the first step that a seeker must take in his path. Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that the seeker must cleanse his heart, and not follow the paths of his forefathers. It is explained that ardour and patience are required to traverse this valley. =The Valley of Love= The next valley is the \\"Valley of Love\\". Bah√° ºu'll√°h describes how love burns away reason, causing pain, madness and single minded endeavour. He writes that the fire of love burns away the material self, revealing instead the world of the spirit. =The Valley of Knowledge= The knowledge referred to in this valley is the knowledge of God, and not one based on learning; it is explained that pride in one's knowledge and accomplishments often disallows one to reach true understanding, which is the knowledge of God. It is explained that the seeker, when in this valley, begins to understand the mysteries contained within God's revelation, and finds wisdom in all things including when faced with pain and hardship, which he understands to be God's mercy and blessing. This valley is called the last limited valley. =The Valley of Unity= The next stage is the valley of unity, and it is explained that the seeker now sees creation not by its limitations, but sees the attributes of God in all created things. The seeker, it is written, is detached from earthly things, is not concerned with his own self and has no ego; instead he praises God for all of creation. =The Valley of Contentment= The next valley for the seeker is the valley of contentment, where it is explained that the seeker becomes independent from all things, and even though he may look poor or is subjected to suffering, he will be endowed with wealth and power from the spiritual worlds and will inwardly be happy. Happiness is explained to be the attribute of the true believer, and it cannot be achieved by obtaining material things, since material things are transitory. =The Valley of Wonderment= In the valley of wonderment the seeker, it is written, is struck dumb (mute) by the beauty of God; the seeker becomes conscious of the vastness and glory of creation, and discovers the inner mysteries of God's revelation. Being led from one mystery of creation to the next, it is explained that the seeker continues to be astonished by the works of God. =The Valley of True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness= The final valley is the valley of true poverty and absolute nothingness, and it is the furthermost state that the mystic can reach. The seeker is poor of all material things, and is rich in spiritual attributes. It is explained that it is the state of annihilation of self in God, but not an existential union: the essences of God's self and the mystic's self remain distinct, in contrast to what appears to be a complete union in other traditions.

It was founded in 1969 under the co- directorship of Arthur Mitchell and Karel Shook. Milton Rosenstock served as the company's music director from 1981 to 1992. The DTH is renowned for being both \\"the first Black classical ballet company\\",Encyclopedia Columbia Encyclopedia. and \\"the first major ballet company to prioritize Black dancers\\". History Arthur Mitchell, the first African-American principal dancer in a major ballet company (New York City Ballet), was sent to Brazil by the United States government to start up the National Ballet of Brazil. While on his way to the airport, he was shocked to hear news of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. In conjunction with the civil rights movement, Dr. King's death inspired Mitchell to forgo his plans in Brazil. Instead, he would found a classical ballet school for the children of Harlem, the poor and predominantly black New York neighborhood where he was raised. Luckily, Karel Shook, the first ballet teacher and a former ballet master at Dutch National Ballet, agreed to join him in founding the school. At the time, Shook was the best and only teacher of European descent willing to train African Americans in classical technique. In the beginning, space at Church of the Master was used to hold classes. Soon afterwards, Mitchell would make a down payment on a disused garage at 466 West 152nd Street and convert it into the headquarters that still house the company today. Initially founded only as a school, Dance Theatre of Harlem as a company of African American ballet dancers was born out a necessity to match funds that had been contributed towards the school's existence. The only way to accomplish this was by earning revenue through performances. Following the original blueprints set forth by his mentor George Balanchine, Mitchell groomed the school's top talent as a group of performers. Though officially incorporated in 1969, Dance Theatre of Harlem would make its official debut with a public performance on January 8, 1971 at New York Guggenheim Museum, with three chamber ballets choreographed by Mitchell. During that opening season, the company's repertory was supplemented with several ballets by Balanchine and Jerome Robbins; in support of Mitchell's vision and company's future, Balanchine had given Mitchell access to all of his ballets. DTH would make its European debut at the Spoleto Festival in 1971. The company produced its first full season in 1974. That same year, the company debuted at Sadler's Wells Theatre. In 1984, Dance Theatre of Harlem premiered its most famous work, Creole Giselle (restaged by Frederic Franklin), which was set in the 1840s Louisiana Bayou. In 1988 DTH embarked on a five-week tour of the USSR, playing sold-out performances in Moscow, Tbilisi, and Leningrad, where the company received a standing ovation at the famed Kirov Theatre. In 1992, the company toured to South AfricaOxford Dictionary of Dance. in the \\"Dancing Through Barriers\\" tour that gave birth to the outreach program of the same name that still continues to operate. South African Suite, a collaboration with the Soweto String Quartet, was created after the company's visit to South Africa and became a staple in the repertoire of the company for years to come. In 1997 the company's dancers went on strike to demand better wages and performing conditions. After much deliberation, the company unionized and joined the American Guild of Musical Artists (AGMA). During the company's 30th anniversary season, Dance Theatre of Harlem and Mitchell were inducted into the National Museum of Dance and the Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 2000 The Dance Theater of Harlem participated in Symphony Space's \\"Wall to Wall Balanchine\\" concert in conjunction with City Ballet's Balanchine centennial. In mid-2004 the Dance Theatre of Harlem Company was put on hiatus due to severe financial constraints within the organization. In 2006 President George W. Bush honored Dance Theatre of Harlem at the White House for an evening of performances given by the DTH Ensemble and former company members. In February 2009 Dance Theatre of Harlem celebrated its 40th anniversary. From 2009 to 2012, The Dance Theatre of Harlem Ensemble, a second company that developed from the professional training program of the DTH school, toured nationally and internationally, under the auspices of Dance For America. In 2011, Virginia Johnson, a founding dancer and former prima ballerina of the company, was named Artistic Director with Arthur Mitchell becoming Artistic Director Emeritus. In 2012, following an eight-year hiatus, Johnson returned Dance Theatre of Harlem to full company status. Since the return of the Dance Theatre of Harlem as a full company, Johnson has commissioned world premieres from Helen Pickett, John Alleyne, Tanya Wideman-Davis and Thaddeus Davis, Darrell Grand Moultrie, and Robert Garland. The new Dance Theatre of Harlem company has also presented ballets by George Balanchine, Nacho Duato, Donald Byrd, Ulysses Dove, Christopher Huggins and Alvin Ailey, among others. The company has held its subsequent seasons at The Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center and at New York City Center. DTH's archives, created and processed with assistance from the Dance Heritage Coalition, hold many important documents from the company's history. These include photographs of the visit of Nelson Mandela to the DTH, a handwritten score by Karel Shook, and designs by Salvatore Ferragamo. In 2013, the DTH archives received a Sustaining Cultural Heritage Collections grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support the improvement of sustainable preservation measures for the DTH archival collection.

The company's Dancing Through Barriers Ensemble does outreach throughout the US.Where Are All the Black Swans?, New York Times, May 6, 2007 (accessed May 6, 2007). It accepts pre-school children up to senior citizens. The school offers specializations in children's movement, European ballet, choreography, and musicology. Dance Theatre of Harlem now has a Pre-Professional Residency program at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., for dancers aged from eight to 18. If accepted, the students meet every Saturday, October through April, and work with DTH resident choreographer Robert Garland. The program includes four levels from beginner to advanced for both ladies and gentlemen of the DC metro area. In April, the program culminates with a performance on the Kennedy Center's Concert Hall stage as a part of the Millennium Stage series. Though the company ceased performing in 2004 due to budgetary constraints,Deficit Threatens Dance Troupe In Harlem (accessed May 13, 2012). during that hiatus the Dancing Though Barriers Ensemble continued its community outreach as the only performing entity of the organization. From 2012 to 2017 Roberto Villanueva served as the director of Dancing Through the Barriers, greatly expanding the program's presence throughout New York.

Like Jalayirid puppet Jahan Tem√ºr, his ancestors were fallen out of favor in Ilkhanate. Yoshmut lost a qurultai to Abaqa in 1265 and died on 18 Jul 1271. Yoshmut's son and Ilyas' grandfather Sogai were executed for treason against Arghun in 1289. Ilyas was raised to the throne around May 1339 by the Chobanid Hasan Kucek and was given title Suleiman Khan. He then married Sati Beg, who had previously been Hasan Kucek's puppet Ilkhan despite being very younger than her. Suleiman was present at the battle on the Jaghatu against the Jalayirids under Hasan Buzurg in June 1340; the Chobanids emerged victorious. Around 1341 the Sarbadars, in an attempt to foster an alliance with the Chobanids, accepted Hasan Kucek as their suzerain, and also recognized Suleiman as Ilkhan. He lost a battle against Eretna near Sivas later. In 1343 Hasan Kucek was murdered and a rivalry broke out for the succession between Sati Beg's son Surgan, Yagi Basti and Malek Asraf. When Malek Asraf defeated Surgan and accused Suleiman of murdering Hasan. Suleiman amassed a part of Hasan Kucek's treasury as well, which led to Surgan, Sati Beg and Suleiman concluding an alliance. Suleiman appealed to Hasan Buzurg to intervene, who escorted him to Tabriz. Malek Ashraf raised another puppet named Anushirwan as new Ilkhan and rode to Tabriz. Hasan Buzurg meanwhile withdrew his support from Suleiman. They fled to Diyarbakr, where Hajji Taghay's nephew Ibrahimshah; where his coins representing Suleiman were struck until 1345.

Portrait by Wilhelm von K√ºgelgen (1836) Ludwig Richter's house at Schlossbrucke in Meissen Statue of Ludwig Richter next to the Albertinum in Dresden Bridal Procession in a Spring Landscape (1847) Civitella (Evening) (1827 - 1828) Adrian Ludwig Richter (September 28, 1803June 19, 1884), a 19th- century German painter and etcher, who was strongly influenced by Erhard and Chodowiecki. He was the most popular, and in many ways the most typical German illustrator of the middle of the 19th century. His work is as typically German and homely as are the fairy-tales of Grimm, for whom he produced several woodcuts. Life He was born in Dresden, the son of the engraver Karl August Richter, from whom he received his training. The interest of his uneventful life centres within the circle of his art. As a painter Richter aimed at a thorough blending of the figure element with the landscape and may be judged by the following examples: \\"Harvest Procession in the Campagna\\" (1833) and three others in the Leipzig Museum: \\"Ferry at the Schreckenstein\\" (1836) and \\"Bridal Procession in Springtime\\" (1847), in the Dresden Gallery; \\"View of the Riesengebirge\\" (1839), in the National Gallery, Berlin. One of his most notable prot√©g√©s was Hermann Lungkwitz. Richter visited Italy from 1823‚Äì1826, and his Thunderstorm in the Sabine Mountains at the Staedel Museum in Frankfurt is one of the rare Italian subjects from his brush. From 1828 he worked as designer for the Meissen factory, living in a house on Schlossbrucke, close to the castle and cathedral, from 1828 to 1836.Plaque on Schlossbrucke, Meissen In 1841 he became professor and head of the landscape atelier at the Dresden Academy, (now Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste Dresden). The Dresden Gallery owns one of his best and most characteristic paintings: Bridal Procession in a Spring Landscape. An eye disease put a stop to the practice of his art in 1874;New International Encyclopedia he was pensioned in 1877, and died at Loschwitz, near Dresden. Main Works Among his 240 etchings are about 140 views in Saxony, others of Salzburg, Rome, and the Campagna. His individuality is most completely revealed in his 3000 or more drawings. Of special charm are his illustrations for The Vicar of Wakefield (1841), for Mus√§us' Volksm√§rchen (1842) and for numerous other fairy tales, for the Goethe Album (1855), for Schiller's Glocke (1857), and those cyclical publications which reveal the most brilliant side of the artist's inexhaustible fancy, such as Beschauliches und Erbauliches (1851); Kinderleben (1852); F√ºrs Haus (1858‚Äì1861); Der gute Hirt (1860); Unser t√§glich Brot (1866); Bilder und Vignetten (1874).

Populating the scene are many juggling celebrities who are notable for being good or creative jugglers, entertaining performers, convention organizers, experts in their field, having a strong presence online or just for having an interesting personality, character or style. It has developed into a fully formed subculture, with tens of thousands of followers. Clubs and organizations Most cities and large towns have juggling clubs, where anyone is welcome to learn and share skills. Many universities and colleges have juggling or circus skills societies. There are also many community circus groups that usually aim to teach young people and put on shows. The first organization to promote juggling and help jugglers was the International Jugglers' Association (IJA), based almost entirely in North America. The World Juggling Federation (WJF) promotes more technical juggling, in contrast to the \\"performing\\" emphasis of the IJA. The European Juggling Association facilitates the annual European Juggling Convention and promotes juggling in Europe. Various countries have national associations, including Italy, Israel, Spain, and Switzerland. There is also the Christian Jugglers Association. Magazines Kaskade was a European juggling magazine, published in both English and German. It was discontinued in 2013 and all its issues were made available online. Juggle is the official publication of the IJA and focuses on the North American scene.http://jugglemagazine.com/ Juggling Magazine is published in Italy and Newton Las Pelotas is published in Argentina and Spain for the Latin American readership. Events Manuel and Christoph Mitasch passing clubs World Juggling Day is the Saturday nearest 17 June (the day the IJA was founded in 1947). There are events organized worldwide to teach people how to juggle, to promote juggling, or for jugglers to get together and celebrate. Many countries, cities, or juggling clubs hold an annual juggling convention. These are the backbone of the juggling scene, because the events regularly bring jugglers from a wide area together. The attendance of a convention can be anything from a few dozen to a few thousand people. The principal focus of most juggling conventions is the main hall, where anybody can juggle, share tricks or try out multi-person passing patterns. There will often be more formal workshops, in which experts work with small groups on skills and techniques. Most juggling conventions also include a big show (open to the general public), competitions, and juggling games. Many juggling conventions host some kind of renegade show, an open stage where anyone can perform at short notice. The Juggling Edge maintains a searchable database of past and upcoming conventions. Objects Modern juggling has moved away from the more dangerous objects, including the chainsaw and machete. However, juggling with flaming torches remains a crowd favourite and is regularly used by jugglers in the modern day. While beginners mainly use balls, both clubs and rings also remain staples of juggling. The objects available to any juggler are only limited by weight, imagination, and pain tolerance.

He is president of the anti-slavery organization Timidria. Ilguilas Weila and five other people were arrested on 28 April 2005 accused of trying to falsely elicit money, two billion CFA francs, from foreign donors. Four were released shortly afterwards but Weila and Alassane Biga were freed on bail by a Niger court on 17 June. He denies any wrongdoing. A demonstration was held on 19 May through the capital Niamey in protest at his arrest. The charges came after a ceremony, in March, to release 7,000 slaves in the northern part of Tillab√©ri Region was cancelled at the last minute by the government who maintains slavery does not exist. At least 43,000 people are thought to live in subjugation across Niger, which officially banned slavery in May 2004. The matter is liable to embarrass the Nigerien president Tandja Mamadou who currently heads the Economic Community of West African States. Much of Weila's work is devoted to informing people of their rights under the new law which are unknown in much of Niger owing to poverty, low literacy and the inaccessibility of many areas. Timidria gives literacy classes to freed slaves and also money so they can start a new life. It is these funds, provided partly by London-based Anti-Slavery International, that Weila is alleged to have stolen. Anti-Slavery International has written an open letter denying these claims. The organization has attempted to highlight Ilguilas Weila's work outside of Niger and he received their Anti-Slavery Award in November 2004. Weila has criticised the ingrained nature of slavery in the region and questioned the role of religion \\"Islam assisted in the indoctrination of slaves through the use of religion, by saying for example if you disobey your master, you will not access paradise, hence your paradise is in the hands of your master,\\" though Islam says no muslim can be a slave.

He listed 22,399 species in his cabinets in 1837‚Äîat the time, the greatest collection of Coleoptera in the world. In 1802, he began publishing a catalogue of his vast collection, including 22,000 species names.

Dejean acted accordingly and often introduced in litteris names, given by himself to replace those already published by other authors. They became invalid. Dejean was president of the Soci√©t√© entomologique de France for the year 1840. In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He died on 17 March 1845.

If down- strokes are played without the addition of upstrokes (as in alternate picking), the tip of the pick never comes in contact with the strings as the hand moves back up to repeat the down-stroke. Uses Guitarists in hard rock genres will often use downpicking to create a \\"heavier\\" sound than what can be achieved with alternate picking, which generally produces more cleanly melded strumming sounds. Downpicking also effectively doubles the effort one would need to alternate pick at the same tempo, however this is hardly noticeable at medium to slow tempos. Downpicking can also be used in a technique called sweep picking, or 'raking'. Extremely fast eighth-note downstroke picking was used in the mid 70's and beyond by famous punk guitarist Johnny Ramone, who used the technique to play full live shows at fast tempos (usually around 180 to 200 bpm). This required extreme levels of stamina, but produced a very high-energy, aggressive sound. This extremely demanding, then-uncommon and somewhat innovative style contributed to Johnny Ramone's reputation as a legendary guitar player, and it influenced many now-famous rock guitarists. Downstroke picking has become a common technique in metal and thrash rhythm playing, notably exemplified by Metallica's James Hetfield (who has been regarded as 'the God of Downpicking'Waters, Jeff. \\"Annihilator Interview Warmup-Riffs  METAL HAMMER\\" Metal Hammer Germany, uploaded: Jan 20, 2011. accessed Jan 04, 2018. ), Misfits' Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein, Megadeth's Dave Mustaine, Ramones' Johnny Ramone, Slayer's Kerry King, Overkill's Bobby Gustafson, and Anthrax's Scott Ian among others. The guitar work of Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" is almost entirely played using downstroked eighth-notes at a tempo of 212 BPM (about 4 downstrokes per second). Up-tempo down-stroke picking requires a strong wrist to keep muscle movements as tension-free as possible. For long or extended passages, endurance becomes the focus, as fast down-picking can quickly cause a burn in the wrist, sometimes extending up into the arm and causing the muscles to seize up. If the guitarist has a difficult time keeping the strokes smooth, the quality of the music can suffer, often sounding sloppy or strained. While down-picking in general is sometimes considered a good beginner's technique for learning at slow tempos, it requires skill to perfect in faster applications.

History  The modern battlefield preservation movement was first undertaken by the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), which was founded in 1987 to save Civil War battlefield land. APCWS acquired thousands of acres of battlefield land as well as offering educational tours and seminars with prominent historians. The original Civil War Trust, a second non-profit focused on preserving Civil War battlefields, was formed in 1991. The Civil War Trust helped acquire and preserve of land in the eight years of its existence and conducted education and heritage tourism programs to educate the public about the significance of the war and of battlefield preservation. The Civil War Preservation Trust was created on November 19, 1999, through the merger of the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS) with the Civil War Trust. The merger, which was propelled by a unanimous vote of both boards, was effected to streamline efforts to protect America's most endangered parcels of Civil War history by acquisition of battlefield lands. On January 11, 2011, the Civil War Preservation Trust shortened its name to the Civil War Trust, and added a new logo. On November 11, 2014 (Veterans Day), the Trust partnered with the Society of the Cincinnati to launch \\"Campaign 1776\\", a subsidiary project designed to protect endangered battlefields from the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 by acquiring battlefield lands.

Preservation methods  Antietam Battlefield, Maryland The American Battlefield Trust is a membership-driven organization that uses donated funds to protect battlefield land from the Civil War, the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Land is acquired by the American Battlefield Trust from private sector parties at fair market value or by donation. Once land is acquired, the Trust is responsible for land stewardship and interpretation, often with assistance from local governments and other preservation groups. In cases where a landowner wants to retain ownership the Trust can arrange a conservation easement to protect their property. Conservation easements prohibit development of property, conserving it in its present state. In its effort to protect American battlefields, the American Battlefield Trust attempts to leverage federal and state programs designed to foster preservation of historic and natural resources. The primary source of federal support for the preservation of Civil War battlefields is the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program (CWBPP), administered by the American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP), an office of the National Park Service. CWBPP is designed to promote the preservation of significant Civil War battlefields by offering competitive matching grants for qualifying preservation opportunities. Other federal sources include the Transportation Enhancement program and the Farm and Ranch Protection Program. The American Battlefield Trust has also leveraged funds made available by state and local governments.  Battlefield preservation  The Civil War Trust has preserved more than of battlefield land from the Civil War, the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 at more than 130 battlefields in 24 states within the United States. Key battlefield preservation initiatives and acquisitions include: Jim Lighthizer at Slaughter Pen Farm * at Fredericksburg, Virginia : The campaign to preserve the Slaughter Pen Farm is the most expensive private battlefield preservation effort in American history.$2m Federal Money Goes to Slaughter Pen Farm ‚Äì Civil War News, December 2006 The Trust, working in partnership with Tricord, Inc., SunTrust Bank, and the Central Virginia Battlefield Trust, was able to purchase the property for $12 million in 2006. To support the preservation efforts at the Slaughter Pen Farm the Department of the Interior awarded a $2 million CWBPP grant based on the significance of the land and the availability of non-federal matching funds. The Slaughter Pen Farm was the largest remaining unprotected part of the Fredericksburg Battlefield. It is also the only place on the battlefield where a visitor can still follow the Union assault from beginning to end. * at The Wilderness, Virginia : In October 2010, the Trust announced a new campaign to acquire of the Wilderness Battlefield in Orange County, Virginia. This Middlebrook Tract includes the eastern edge of Saunders Field and land associated with the May 6, 1864, flank attack by Confederate forces under John B. Gordon. Historian and author Gordon Rhea stated that this land \\"witnessed some of the Wilderness' most brutal combat\\". After reaching its $1,085,000 fundraising goal in under three months, the Trust acted as a steward for the land until May 2014, when it was transferred to Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. Building on this acquisition, the Trust in 2011 was also able to secure a parcel that was the site of Union commander Ulysses S. Grant's daytime headquarters during the fighting.\\"Overland Campaign Anniversary Begins with Expansion of Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania National Military Park\\", May 3, 2014. * at Glendale, Virginia : While the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs remain a prime area for development, the Trust has made significant acquisitions at the Glendale battlefield, preserving in 2007 and overall. Over 80 percent of the battlefield is now preserved. When combined with previous efforts at nearby Malvern Hill, the Trust has now created a three-mile-long (5 km) continuous corridor of protected battlefield. * at Champion Hill, Mississippi : Using an easement rather than acquiring the land, the Trust protected at the heart of the Champion Hill battlefield in 2007. This key portion of the field is still owned by the Champion family, for whom the area and the battle were named, but now is under conservation easement. The Champion family will maintain ownership of their historic land while realizing their intention of seeing it protected in perpetuity. * at Shiloh, Tennessee : As the United States marked the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Shiloh, the Trust announced it had the opportunity to purchase a property on and around Shiloh Hill, including significant frontage on the Tennessee River. After completing a $1.25 million fundraising campaign, the Trust deeded the land to Shiloh National Military Park, the largest addition to the park since it was founded in 1894. Cumulatively, the Trust has protected at Shiloh, much of which has been integrated into the national park. * at Chancellorsville, Virginia CWPT Preserved Land at Chancellorsville : The Trust has a record of working with preservation-friendly developers to protect battlefield land. In 2004, the Trust worked with Spotsylvania County officials and family-owned Tricord, Inc., to protect of land associated with the First Day at Chancellorsville Battlefield. Two years later, a similar deal was worked out with Spotsylvania County and Toll Brothers, Inc. to protect another of this historic battleground. Because of these efforts, more than of contiguous battlefield land along the historic Orange Turnpike have been preserved. : In addition to its efforts at the First Day at Chancellorsville site, the Trust has helped protect more than at other places of the battlefield, including more than on the site of Stonewall Jackson's famous flank attack. * at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania : The Trust has been an active participant in a variety of projects at the Gettysburg Battlefield, leading to the protection of .

Robert E. Lee made his headquarters during the battle. Previous high-profile projects at Gettysburg in which the Trust was involved include the purchase of the Daniel Lady Farm and the former Gettysburg Country Club, .

Preservation initiatives  A billboard drawing attention to the proposed casino at Gettysburg To further its aim of preserving American Civil War battlefields, the Trust has engaged in grassroots and community outreach efforts and had conducted campaigns against development projects that have threatened battlefields. =No Casino Gettysburg= The Gettysburg Battlefield has faced two separate threats from proposed casinos. In 2005 a proposal was put forward to build a casino with 3,000 slot machines less than a mile from the Gettysburg Battlefield. Soon after the proposal was announced, the Civil War Trust joined forces with a local concerned citizens group called No Casino Gettysburg to advocate against the proposal. Later, the Trust formed the Stop the Slots Coalition, a collection of national and local groups opposed to the casino. On December 20, 2006, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board voted to reject the Gettysburg casino proposal. In 2010, a new Gettysburg Casino application was filed and the Trust, with a broad coalition of partners, undertook a successful campaign to prevent approval of this new application. Nearly 300 prominent historians wrote to the Pennsylvania Gaming Board, urging the rejection of the application. Susan Eisenhower, Emmy award-winning filmmaker Ken Burns, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author David McCullough, Medal of Honor recipient Paul W. Bucha, composer John Williams, and actors Matthew Broderick, Stephen Lang (actor), and Sam Waterston were all featured in a Jeff Griffiths produced video declaring their opposition to the proposed Gettysburg casino. On April 14, 2011, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board voted to reject this second proposal to bring casino gambling to the doorstep of Gettysburg National Military Park. =Chancellorsville rezoning= In May 2002, a regional developer announced a plan to build 2,300 houses and of commercial space on the Mullins Farm, site of the first day of fighting at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Soon thereafter, the Civil War Trust formed the Coalition to Save Chancellorsville, a network of national and local preservation groups, that waged a vocal campaign against the development. For nearly a year, the Coalition mobilized local citizens, held candlelight vigils and hearings, and encouraged residents to become more involved in preservation. Public opinion polling conducted by the Coalition found that more than two-thirds of local residents opposed the development. The survey also found that 90 percent of local residents believed their county has a responsibility to protect Chancellorsville and other historic resources. As a result of these efforts, in March 2003 the Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors denied the rezoning application that would have allowed for the development of the site.Board OKs Plan That Will Save 143 Acres At Chancellorsville ‚Äì Civil War News Immediately following the vote, the Civil War Trust and other Coalition members began working to acquire the battlefield. By working with county officials and developers, the Civil War Trust acquired in 2004 and another in 2006. =Morris Island= With the help of the Civil War Trust, the Morris Island Coalition was formed in early 2004 to oppose development on historic Morris Island outside Charleston, South Carolina. Morris Island was the scene of the charge of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry on Fort Wagner, famously depicted in the film Glory. The Coalition, led by local resident Blake Hallman, generated local government support for preservation of Morris Island.Morris Island plan faces major foe ‚Äì Charleston Post & Courier Press reaction was favorable as well, and public opinion polls found that an overwhelming number of Charleston residents wanted to see the barrier island remain undeveloped. Hallman earned the Civil War Trust's \\"Preservationist of the Year\\" award for his efforts to save Morris Island.Great day for Morris Island ‚Äì Charleston Post & Courier At one time, development plans called for a 20-unit luxury house development on Cummings Point (the site of Fort Wagner). In early 2005, the landowner tried unsuccessfully to sell the property on eBay. At the end of 2005, a preservation-friendly developer acquired the property. He later agreed to sell it to the Trust for Public Land (TPL) for preservation purposes a few months later. In 2008, the Trust engaged in fundraising efforts in support of the State of South Carolina, City of Charleston, and the Trust for Public Land's $3m effort that would preserve an additional of Morris Island. =Stop the Wilderness Walmart= Together with the Friends of Wilderness Battlefield, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Piedmont Environmental Council, the National Parks Conservation Association, Preservation Virginia and a group of concerned local residents, the Civil War Trust opposed the construction of a Walmart Supercenter on the Wilderness Battlefield in Orange County, Virginia. Following a nationwide outcry from preservationists and historians alike, Walmart Stores, Inc. announced in January 2011 that it had \\"decided to preserve\\" rather than develop the historic site where local officials had given the company permission to construct its newest superstore in 2009. Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian James McPherson had identified the site as part of \\"the nerve center of the Union Army during the Battle of the Wilderness.\\" Trust President Jim Lighthizer praised Walmart's decision, stating that founder Sam Walton, a veteran of the Second World War, would have been \\"proud\\" of his company's move to preserve the hallowed ground. \\"We stand ready to work with Walmart to put this controversy behind us and protect the battlefield from further encroachment,\\" Lighthizer stated. \\"We firmly believe that preservation and progress need not be mutually exclusive, and welcome Walmart as a thoughtful partner in efforts to protect the Wilderness Battlefield.\\" In November 2013, Walmart donated the historic site comprising more than to the Commonwealth of Virginia.\\"Wilderness Battlefield land donated by Wal-Mart\\", Washington Post, November 10, 2013.  Educational programs  Volunteers help clean up the battlefields on Park Day In addition to preserving Civil War battlefield land, the American Battlefield Trust conducts programs designed to inform the public about the events and consequences of the Civil War, the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, create a personal connection to the past and foster an understanding of the need for preservation and how it benefits society. * battlefields.org ‚Äì The American Battlefield Trust's web site provides comprehensive educational information about the Civil War, the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, including numerous battle maps, primary sources, lesson plans, photos, animated maps, and 360¬∞ panoramic battlefield views. * Hallowed Ground ‚Äì the Trust's quarterly magazine, includes articles on history, preservation techniques and upcoming events. * American Battlefield Trust Teacher Institute Series ‚Äì The American Battlefield Trust conducts an annual event featuring teacher workshops and visits to the nation's historic battlefields, as well as regional sessions focusing on resources available locally. * Public Education ‚Äì the American Battlefield Trust maintains a two-week curriculum for use in classrooms. * Civil War Battle Apps ‚Äì GPS-enabled battlefield touring applications for smartphones and other mobile devices. * Civil War Discovery Trail ‚Äì a heritage tourism initiative that links more than 600 Civil War sites in 32 states, and promotes visitation through themed itineraries; it is one of the White House Millennium Council's sixteen flagship National Millennium Trails. * Battlefield Interpretation ‚Äì The American Battlefield Trust works to interpret many of the battlefields that it saves with wayside exhibits, walking trails, and smartphone GPS-enabled battlefield touring applications. * Park Day ‚Äì The American Battlefield Trust's annual volunteer clean-up day at battlefield sites throughout the United States. * Teacher and Student Programs ‚Äì The American Battlefield Trust hosts numerous contests, workshops, and programs for students and teachers.

It was produced by Tilde Corsi, Gianni Romoli and Soavi and based on the novel Dellamorte Dellamore by Tiziano Sclavi. Everett plays a beleaguered caretaker of a small Italian cemetery, who searches for love while defending himself from dead people who keep rising again. It is an international co-production between Italy, France, and Germany. Plot Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) is the cemetery caretaker in the small Italian town of Buffalora. He lives in a ramshackle house on the premises, constantly surrounded by death, with only his mentally handicapped assistant Gnaghi (Fran√ßois Hadji-Lazaro) for company. Young punks in town spread gossip that Dellamorte is impotent. His hobbies are reading outdated telephone directories, in which he crosses out the names of the deceased, and trying to assemble a puzzle shaped like a human skull. Gnaghi can speak only one word: \\"Gna.\\" The Latin inscription over the Buffalora Cemetery gate reads RESURRECTURIS (\\"For those who will rise again\\"), and indeed, Dellamorte has his hands full. Some people rise from their graves within seven nights following their deaths, as aggressive zombies. Dellamorte destroys these creatures, which he calls \\"Returners\\", before they overrun the town. Buffalora's mayor (Stefano Masciarelli) is so fixated on his reelection campaign that he doesn't register Dellamorte's pleas for an investigation. Being an outcast in the village and almost illiterate, Dellamorte doesn't want to lose his job. He opens up to his only friend, Franco, a municipal clerk, but doesn't file the paperwork to get assistance. He explains, \\"It's easier just to shoot them.\\" At a funeral, Dellamorte falls in love with the unnamed young widow (Anna Falchi) of a rich, elderly man. She is won over when Dellamorte tells her about the ossuary, which she adores. While consummating their relationship by her husband's grave, the undead husband arises and bites her. She seems to die from the bite, but the coroner claims it was a heart attack. Fearing the worst, Dellamorte stays near her corpse, and shoots her when she rises. Gnaghi becomes infatuated with the mayor's teen daughter, Valentina (Fabiana Formica), but she is tragically decapitated in a motorcycle accident. Undeterred, Gnaghi digs up her reanimated head and begins an innocent romance. The relationship is cut short, however, when the mayor finds out and Valentina rips out his throat with her teeth. Dellamorte is forced to shoot her. The young widow also rises again, causing Dellamorte to believe she was not really a zombie when he first shot her, in which case it was he who killed her. He plummets into a depression and is visited by the leering figure of Death, who tells him to \\"Stop killing the dead\\" and suggests shooting the living instead. Dellamorte encounters two more unnamed women, also played by Falchi. The first is an assistant to the new mayor. She confesses to Dellamorte that she is terrified of sexual penetration, so Dellamorte demands to have his penis removed by the local doctor. Refusing to do so, the doctor instead gives him an injection to induce temporary impotence. Meanwhile, the woman has been raped by and fallen in love with her employer. Having lost her phobia, she plans to marry her rapist and discards the cemetery man. His grip on reality slipping, Dellamorte heads into town at night and shoots the young men who have made fun of him for years. He meets a third manifestation of the woman he loves but, upon learning she is a prostitute, kills her and two other women by setting their house on fire. His friend Franco (Anton Alexander) is accused of these murders after killing his wife and child, and attempts suicide. Dellamorte goes to visit Franco in the hospital. Sitting by the hospital bed, he casually murders a nun, a nurse, and a doctor. Franco claims to not recognize him. Distraught and confused, Dellamorte screams out a confession, but is ignored. Gnaghi and Dellamorte pack up their car, and leave Buffalora. Gnaghi's head is injured when Dellamorte slams on the brakes. They get out of the vehicle and walk to the edge of the road, where it drops into a chasm. Gnaghi begins to seize and collapses to the ground. Dellamorte realizes that the rest of the world doesn't exist. Fearing his assistant is dying, he loads a gun with two dumdum bullets to finish them both off. However, Dellamorte cannot bring himself to shoot his friend. Gnaghi wakes up, drops the gun off the cliff, and asks to be taken home, speaking clearly for the first time. Dellamorte replies: \\"Gna.\\" As the credits roll, the camera zooms out to reveal the two men standing in a snow globe.

Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film on R1 DVD in 2006 under the American title Cemetery Man.Cemetery Man page on Anchor Bay's website Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 61% of 28 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.07/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Cemetery Man will frustrate viewers seeking narrative cohesion or coherence, but this surreal brand of humor and horror should satisfy B-movie fans in the mood for quirk\\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film is unconventional but becomes repetitive as Everett dispatches shallow metaphors for fascism. Bob Stephens of The San Francisco Examiner wrote that the film suffers from an uneven tone but \\"is redeemed by his uncommon visual imagination\\". Deborah Young of Variety wrote, \\"A hip, offbeat horror item floating on a bed of dark philosophy, Dellamorte Dellamore is a deceptively easy genre picture with hidden depths.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"It aims high and misses, but it does hold interest with visual flash, wry humor and a couple of sex scenes that can make steam come out of your ears.\\" In more modern reviews, Bloody Disgusting rated it 5/5 stars and called it \\"one of the greatest cult films of the last twenty years\\". Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote that Soavi's direction and film's humor make it different and memorable. Director Martin Scorsese called Dellamorte Dellamore one of the best Italian films of the 1990s.\\"Michele Soavi - Filmography\\", New York Times Sequel In January 2011, Fangoria reported that director Michele Soavi was planning a sequel.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the infamous battle that took place on 21 April on Victoria Road in Glasgow when republicans were marching in support of the blanket protest in Long Kesh. As the march made its way down Victoria Road it came under sustained attack from Scottish loyalists, resulting in several band members being injured. After the events of that day, it was decided that republicans should organise themselves into one organisation. The West of Scotland Republican Band Alliance was formed. All future marches would be organised by the Band Alliance committee. At their peak in the mid 1980s, there were 18 flute bands in the Band Alliance. The organisation declared its support for former member and Provisional Irish Republican Army prisoner Michael Dickson imprisoned for an attack on the Osnabr√ºck barracks in Germany and are the only republican organisation in Scotland to do so.

It is located on the D8 road, between the Ora≈°ac and Brseƒçine. Trsteno Arboretum Trsteno is most famous for its arboretum, is the oldest arboretum in this part of the world. The arboretum was erected by the local noble family of Gozze in the late 15th century, who requested ship captains to bring back seeds and plants from their travels. The exact start date for the arboretum is unknown, but it was already in existence by 1492, when a 15 m span aqueduct to irrigate the arboretum was constructed; this aqueduct is still in use. It has been the property of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1948, when it was donated. The Arboretum reserves a very special place among the old Ragusan, Dalmatian and Mediterranean parks. It includes a park surrounding the fifteenth century summer residence, which is a monument of garden architecture, and a nineteenth century park at Drvarica. The arboretum passed into Yugoslav state ownership in 1945, and was declared a natural rarity in 1948. Since 1950 it has been managed by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1962 the Arboretum Trsteno was registered in the list of protected natural monuments list as a monument of landscape architecture. The protected area covers around 255,000 square metres. Trsteno suffered extensive damage and looting during the Croatian War of Independence when on October 2 and 3rd, 1991, the Yugoslav People's Army launched a series of gunboat and air attacks and set the Arboretum afire, destroying a large part of it, and causing partial damage to the summer residence and the oldest part of the arboretum. The arboretum was further severely damaged in 2000 by a forest fire during a drought, when around 120,000 square metres were lost in fire. The pride of the arboretum, two Oriental Planes located on the central market place of Trsteno, survived both disasters undamaged. They are over 500 years old and are unique specimens of its kind in Europe. The ancient trees are both about 45/60 m tall and their trunks are 5 m in diameter. Within what was once the noble family's country house, there is the oldest Renaissance park in Croatia, designed in 1502, with numerous exotic plants.  In popular culture  In the third season and fourth season of the television series Game of Thrones, Trsteno and its Arboretum was used as the setting of the Red Keep palace gardens in King's Landing.

West writes about the military, warfighting, and counterinsurgency. In the Vietnam War, he fought in major operations and conducted over a hundred combat patrols in 1966‚Äì1968. For the United States Marine Corps, he wrote the training manual Small Unit Action in Vietnam, describing how to fight in close combat. As an analyst at the RAND Corporation, he wrote a half dozen detailed monographs about fighting against an insurgency. Later, as Assistant Secretary of Defense, he dealt with the insurgencies in El Salvador. From 2003 through 2008, he made 16 extended trips to Iraq, going on patrols and writing three books and numerous articles about the war. From 2007 through 2011, he made numerous trips to embed in Afghanistan. Life and career West is from the Massachusetts communities of Dorchester, Boston, Milton and Scituate. He is a graduate of Georgetown University (BA) and Princeton University (MA), where he was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. West was an infantry officer in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. He led the mortar platoon of 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines.Blankenship, Janie. \\"Vets of WWI Through Vietnam Became Famous in the Literary World\\", VFW Magazine (April 2015), p. 52. Later, he served with a Combined Action Platoon that fought for 485 days in a remote village. He was also a member of the Marine Force Reconnaissance team that initiated \\"Operation Stingray\\": small unit attacks behind enemy lines. He authored a study at the RAND Corporation entitled \\"The Strike Teams: Tactical Performance and Strategic Potential\\". This paper was the featured event at the 1970 Department of Defense Counterinsurgency Research and Development Symposium. The RAND Military Systems Simulations Group implemented a classified model of West's concept. This doctrinal innovation was directly opposed by Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV), which favored the Army's concept of Air- Mobility \\"Fire and Thunder Operations\\". By way of rebuttal, West wrote The Village, chronicling the daily lives of 15 Marines who protected Vietnamese villagers by living among them in their hamlets. The book became a classic of practical counterinsurgency and has been on the Marine Corps Commandant's Required Reading List for five decades. West served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs in the Ronald Reagan administration, and chaired the United States Security Commissions with El Salvador, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, South Korea, and Japan. Among other awards, West is the recipient of the Department of Defense Distinguished Public Service Medal, the Department of the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Medal, and Tunisia's Medaille de Libert√©. A member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Infantry Order of St. Crispin, he appears frequently on C-SPAN and The News Hour on PBS. =Writing= West is the author of ten books. His 2019 collaboration with Marine General Jim Mattis, entitled \\"Call Sign Chaos: Learing to Lead\\", was the #1 New York Times Bestseller.NY Times Book Review, 22Sept2019 A prior book, written with retired Marine Major General Ray \\"E-Tool\\" Smith, The March Up,Gal Perl Finkel, General Mattis: A warrior diplomat, The Jerusalem Post, December 12, 2016. was awarded the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation's General Wallace M. Greene, Jr. Award for non-fiction, as well as the William E. Colby Award for military history. The Veterans of Foreign Wars presented West with its National Media Award in 2005, after he wrote the book No True Glory: A Frontline Account of the Battle for Fallujah. His book The Strongest Tribe, is a history of the Iraq War that was a New York Times Best Seller and was ranked by Foreign Affairs magazine as #7 among the top foreign policy books of 2009. Into the Fire ranked #8 on the New York Times Best Seller List. In The Strongest Tribe and in a subsequent article in Military Review about counterinsurgency lessons, West argued that the current doctrine of nation-building and winning hearts and minds by economic development was based on Western liberal theory rather than the realities of battle. West has grave reservations about extolling the effects of \\"non-kinetic COIN\\" (counterinsurgency). He believes that the warriors, not the people, defeat warriors, and that America's mistake in both Iraq and Afghanistan was to concede all authority to appoint and to remove for cause military and police officers. He believes American policymakers tried to do too much with too little in too short a time. His articles have appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Atlantic, The National Review, and The Washington Post He is the recipient of the Department of Defense Distinguished Public Service Medal, the Marine Corps Heritage Award (twice), the Goodpaster Prize for Military Scholarship, the Father Clyde E.

Together with its relatives the American goldfinch and Lawrence's goldfinch, it forms the American goldfinches clade in the genus Spinus sensu stricto. The American goldfinches can be distinguished by the males having a black (rarely green) forehead, whereas the latter is (like the rest of the face) red or yellow in the European goldfinch and its relatives. North American males are markedly polymorphic and five subspecies are often named; at least two of them seem to represent a less-progressed stage in evolution, however. Taxonomy The lesser goldfinch was formally described by the American zoologist Thomas Say in 1822 under the binomial name Fringilla psaltria. Although the year is given as 1823 on the title page, the volume was actually published on 31 Decemeber 1822. See: The specific epithet psaltria is Ancient Greek for a female harpist. The type locality is Colorado Springs, Colorado. The lesser goldfinch is now placed in the genus Spinus that was introduced in 1816 by the German naturalist Carl Ludwig Koch. Five subspecies are recognised: * S. p. hesperophilus (Oberholser, 1903) ‚Äì west USA and northwest Mexico * S. p. witti Grant, PR, 1964 ‚Äì Tres Marias Islands (off west Mexico) * S. p. psaltria (Say, 1822) ‚Äì west-central USA to south-central Mexico * S. p. jouyi (Ridgway, 1898) ‚Äì southeast Mexico and northwest Belize * S. p. colombianus (Lafresnaye, 1843) ‚Äì south Mexico to Peru and Venezuela Description This petite species is not only the smallest North American Spinus finch, it may be the smallest true finch in the world.Peterson et al. (1990), Sibley (2000)Hilty, Steven L., Birds of Venezuela, 2002, Princeton University Press Some sources list more subtropical Spinus species as slightly smaller on average, including the Andean siskin.Finches and Sparrows by Peter Clement. Princeton University Press (1999). . This species ranges from in length and can weigh from .Birds of the World blogCRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . There is a slight NW-SE cline in size, with the largest birds from Mexico and further south being up to one-fifth larger than the smallest from the extreme northwest of its range; this effect is more pronounced in females. There is also considerable variation in the amount of black on head and back in males, and thus three subspecies have been proposed. But this variation, too, seems to be simple and clinal changes in allele frequency, and thus the \\"subspecies\\" might be better considered morphs or geographic forms.Willoughby (2007) Black-backed goldfinch (S. p. psaltria) male from Borrego Springs (California, 116¬∞22‚Ä≤19‚Ä≥W). Ear region is usually dark in typical psaltria. Males are easily recognized by their bright yellow underparts and big white patches in the tail (outer rectrices) and on the wings (the base of the primaries). They range from having solid black from the back to the upper head including the ear-coverts to having these regions medium green; each of the back, crown and ear regions varies in darkness rather independently though, as a rule, the ears are not darker than the rest. In most of the range, dark psaltria birds (the black- backed goldfinch) predominate. The light birds are termed hesperophilus (the green-backed goldfinch) and are most common in the far western U.S. and northwestern Mexico. The zone in which both light and dark males occur on a regular basis is broadest in the north, and extends across the width of the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Madre Occidental ranges. It reaches the Pacific Coast in southern Sonora to northern Sinaloa, roughly between the area of Ciudad Obreg√≥n to Culiac√°n. In the United States, the most diverse array of phenotypes can be found in Colorado and New Mexico. East of the 106th meridian west in southwestern Texas as well as in most of Mexico, almost all males have black backs. Spinus psaltria colombianus (the Columbian goldfinch), east and south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, is richer yellow below in males. This, as well as the even yellower S. p. jouyi (the Yucat√°n goldfinch) from the Yucat√°n Peninsula and adjacent regions and S. p. witti (the Tres Mar√≠as goldfinch) from the Islas Mar√≠as off NayaritQuatro (2007) require more study, especially as at least the former two seem also to be significantly larger and longer- billed. Female Females' and immatures' upperparts are more or less grayish olive-green; their underparts are yellowish, buffier in immatures. They have only a narrow strip of white on the wings (with other white markings in some forms) and little or no white on the tail. They are best distinguished from other members of the genus by the combination of small size, upperparts without white or yellow, and dark gray bill. In all plumages, this bird can easily be taken for a New World warbler if the typical finch bill is not seen well. Like other goldfinches, it has an undulating flight in which it frequently gives a call: in this case, a harsh chig chig chig.Sibley (2000) Another distinctive call is a very high-pitched, drawn-out whistle, often rising from one level pitch to another (teeeyeee) or falling (teeeyooo). The song is a prolonged warble or twitter, more phrased than that of the American goldfinch,Peterson et al. (1990) often incorporating imitations of other species. Distribution and habitat Lesser goldfinch landing in Santa Fe, New Mexico This American goldfinch ranges from the southwestern United States (near the coast, as far north as extreme southwestern Washington) to Venezuela and Peru. It migrates from the colder parts of its U.S. range. The lesser goldfinch often occurs in flocks or at least loose associations. It utilizes almost any habitat with trees or shrubs except for dense forest, and is common and conspicuous in many areas, often coming near houses. It is common at feeders in the Southwest United States and will come almost anywhere with thistle sock feeders. Flocks of at least six birds will often be seen at feeders. It feeds mostly on tree buds and weed seeds; geophagy has been observed in this species.Delgado-V. (2006) The nesting season is in summer in the temperate parts of its range; in the tropics it apparently breeds all-year round, perhaps less often in September and October.Cisneros-Heredia (2006) It lays three or four bluish white eggs in a cup nest made of fine plant materials such as lichens, rootlets, and strips of bark, placed in a bush or at low or middle levels in a tree. The moult occurs in two different patterns which coincides with the blackness of the upperparts quite well. Here too is a broad zone of intergradation. Pacific birds moult after breeding, and females shed a few body feathers before breeding too. Juvenile males shed more remiges than females when moulting into adult plumage. East of the 106th meridian west, birds moult strongly before breeding and replace another quantity of feathers afterwards, and post-juvenal moult does not differ significantly between the sexes. However, this seems dependent on the differing rainfall regimes; simply put, birds at least anywhere in the North American range moult most of their plumage at the end of the dry season and may replace more feathers at the end of the wet season. Considered a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN due to its vast range, it nonetheless seems to be declining locally. For example, it is rare in the Ecuadorean Andes foothills.

He resigned June 27, 1962, but served as chairman of the company for several years. He also had numerous ships, owning Prudential Lines. Skouras and two brothers came to the United States as immigrants in 1910; Spyros kept such a pronounced Greek accent in English that comedian Bob Hope would joke \\"Spyros has been here twenty years but he still sounds as if he's coming next week.\\" Skouras oversaw the production of such epics as Cleopatra (1963) with Elizabeth Taylor, as well as the development of Century City. His grandchildren include Charles P. Skouras III, a film and television executive. His great- granddaughter Marielle Skouras has produced more than 25 television shows and created Beverly Hills Pawn, a hit reality show on REELZchannel. The early years Spyros Panagiotis Skouras was born in 1893 in Skourochori, Greece to a family whose father was a sheepherder. Together with his brothers Charles and George Skouras, he emigrated to the United States in 1910. The brothers settled in St. Louis, Missouri, at that time the fourth-largest city in America and a booming industrial city. Living frugally on wages as busboys and bartenders in downtown hotels, by 1914 the brothers had savings of $3,500. In partnership with two other Greeks, the Skourases constructed a modest nickelodeon at 1420 Market Street; today's Kiel Opera House now occupies this site. They called their theater the Olympia, and soon acquired other theaters. The brothers incorporated in 1924 with $400,000 capital stock. By then more than thirty local theaters belonged to the Skouras Brothers Co. of St. Louis. The biggest moment for the Skouras empire came when their dream of building a world-class movie palace in downtown St. Louis was realized in 1926 when they opened the $5.5 million Ambassador Theatre Building. In 1929, following the Stock Market Crash, the triumvirate sold out their interest to Warner Brothers and moved east, gaining executive places in the industry, which was then based in the New York area. From 1929 to 1931 during the Great Depression, Spyros Skouras worked as a general manager of the Warner Brothers Theater Circuit in the United States. During these hard years, he eliminated losses and eventually quadrupled the profits of the chain. Despite this success, his wish to be his own boss again made him voluntarily leave the company. After that, and for a short while, he worked as a manager for Paramount. In 1932, the Skouras Brothers (Charles, Spyros and George) took over the management of the Fox West Coast Theater chain, with more than 500 theaters. The studio was threatened with bankruptcy due to falloff in business because of the Depression. The three brothers worked to help the company survive. =Marriage and family= Skouras had several children with his wife, including sons Spyros S. Skouras, Plato A. Skouras. His daughter jumped from a building to her death. Athanasios Skouras, member of the Greek Resistant Organisation PEAN during the Axis Occupation of Greece in the Second World War, was a relative of his.huffingtonpost.gr Rise to influence In May 1935 Spyros Skouras took the initiative for the merger of Fox Studios with Twentieth Century Pictures. He served as president of the merged company 20th Century Fox from 1942 to 1962. Skouras was also a major stockholder of 20th Century Fox. In the 1950s he, together with his brothers, controlled 20th Century Fox, National Theaters, Fox West Coast Theaters, United Artists Theaters, Skouras Theaters, Magna Corp, and Todd AO. Skouras' assets in 1952 amounted to $108,000,000, greater than any other theater or movie mogul, including the Schencks, Warners, Shuberts, or his countryman Alexander Pantages. Skouras oversaw the production of such classics as Don't Bother to Knock, The Seven Year Itch, The Hustler, The King and I, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and The Robe. He signed a young model named Norma Jean Baker to 20th Century Fox who, after changing her name to Marilyn Monroe, rose to fame as the most famous Hollywood sex symbol of the 20th century. Monroe, who never knew her father, developed a special relationship with Skouras, and sometimes called him \\"Papa Skouras\\".Curti, Carlo (1967). Skouras, King of Fox Studios. Los Angeles: Holloway House Publishing Company, p. 130, 149. During Skouras' tenure, the longest in the company's history, he worked to rescue the faltering movie industry from the lure of television. 20th Century Fox's advertising slogan, Movies are Better than Ever, gained credibility in 1953 when Spyros introduced CinemaScope in the studio's groundbreaking feature film The Robe. The wide screen CinemaScope increased the appeal of movies, helping them maintain audiences against television. This new technology soon became the standard of the whole industry. Later years Cost overruns on such films as Cleopatra (1963) resulted in a shareholder revolt demanding a change in management.Gary Baum, \\"Why Century City Ranks Among the Worst Real Estate Deals in Hollywood History\\", The Hollywood Reporter, September 26, 2013 Darryl F. Zanuck was elected president of the company while Skouras served as chairman of the company for several years. In parallel with his work in the film industry, Skouras had invested in the shipping industry, where many Greek immigrants had interest. By the 1960s, his Prudential Lines owned seven ships, two tankers, and five cargo ships. In 1969, Prudential Lines bought out Grace Lines. In the last years of his life, Skouras disengaged from the movie world and spent more time on his various maritime projects. His son Spyros S. Skouras eventually took these over. His son Plato A. Skouras (1930‚Äì2004) produced five films, including Francis of Assisi (1961) and Sierra Baron (1958). Skouras died from a heart attack at the age of 78. NotesReferences *Chrissochoidis, Ilias (ed.).

The 148 ft (45 m), half-mile (800 m) dam (and outlet works) construction began in 1965 and was completed in 1973. Cave Run Lake is in the northern part of the Daniel Boone National Forest. Cave Run Lake provides flood protection to the lower Licking River valley, supplies water to the area's communities, improves the Licking River's water flow conditions, and offers a habitat for various species of fish and wildlife. It is in Rowan, Morgan, Menifee, and Bath counties. Recreation The lake also provides various other recreational activities (swimming, boating & sailing, canoe and kayak, jet skiing, camping, hiking, well known for Mountain Bike trails, etc.) There are two marinas that serve the lake, Scott's Creek Marina and Long Bow Marina. Zilpo Road A scenic byway, is one road which provides access to the Bath County side of Cave Run Lake and is usually accessible throughout the year. The byway provides access to pioneer weapons hunting areas, a campground, and numerous hiking trails. Cave run also has designated beaches for recreational use. A small fee will allow you to enter the beaches and partake in swimming, hiking, and barbequing.  Tourism  Cave run lake offers a wide variety of fishing opportunities. Cave run is home to a variety of aquatic species such as crappie, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, musky, and various pan fish. Fishing tournaments are also held on the lake. Boat charters with a professional guide can be purchased on the lake. The Daniel Boone National Forest surrounding Cave Run holds many opportunities. Free campsites can be found in the state park and is first-come, first-served. The forest contains hiking trails and hunting is permitted during the regular season. Horseback riding is allowed on the trails. Visitors can visit Cave Run's sand beaches for a small entry fee. These beaches do not have a lifeguard on duty. The state park offers showers at the beach sites as well as restrooms. Designated barbeque sites can be found along the shoreline. Throughout certain spots of the land surrounding the lake, ATV's and other off-road vehicles are allowed. Lodging is readily available around the lake.

The resort complex is a primary recreational destination for the northern Georgian.  History  The Lake Lanier islands were originally large hills near Gainesville. After the creation of Buford Dam and the flooding of part of the Chattahoochee River valley created Lake Lanier, the hills became the largest chain of islands in the lake. In 1957, The US Army Corps of Engineers leased the Lake Lanier islands to the Georgia Department of State Parks, which partnered with the newly created Lake Lanier Islands Development Authority (LLIDA) in 1962 to manage and develop a recreational venue for the citizens of Georgia to enjoy. Development included Harbor Landing boat docks, campgrounds, horse stables, beaches, a golf course and the Pine Isle Hotel. A water park opened in 1987. Events held at the complex include annual Independence Day fireworks, on the lake, full moon parties, and \\"Magical Nights of Lights.\\" The State of Georgia contracted with the KSL Corporation to take over the day-to-day management and operations of Lake Lanier Islands. In August 2005, Virgil Williams, through his venture, Lake Lanier Islands Management Company, bought the resort complex from the KSL Corporation. The purchase was for 14.5 million dollars. Since purchasing the resort, the KLL Corporation has worked to improve the islands. After nearly 30 years of operation the original Pine Isle Resort was demolished. Under the ownership of the Lake Lanier Islands Management Company, the property has received numerous upgrades and renovations. In 2008, it completed renovations at Legacy Lodge & Conference Center when the previous Emerald Point Hotel & Conference Center \\"was completely rebuilt using only the shell of the original structure.\\" In April 2014, Legacy Lodge opened a saltwater lounging pool, replacing their previous pool and hot tubs.

The upgrades included \\"214 rooms now have new hardwood floors, artwork and decor with an outdoors theme, as well as new bedding, mini-refrigerators and Keurig coffee makers. Other upgrades include newly painted woodwork and ceilings throughout the hotel, new wallcoverings in guest rooms and corridors, new carpets in corridors and new lighting and window treatments.\\" In 2018 the Lake Lanier Islands Management Company made a deal with Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville Development and SafeHarbor in order to invest millions of dollars into the island and theme park LanierWorld, and assume management.

Life He was born at Ottensen in Holstein-Pinneberg (today Hamburg) on 8 March 1607; the son of the Lutheran pastor of that place, Caspar Rist. He received his early training at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg and the Gymnasium Illustre in Bremen; he then studied theology at the University of Rinteln. Under the influence of Josua Stegman there, his interest in hymn writing began. On leaving Rinteln, he tutored the sons of a Hamburg merchant, accompanying them to the University of Rostock, where he himself studied Hebrew, mathematics, and medicine. During his time at Rostock, the Thirty Years War almost emptied the University, and Rist himself lay there for several weeks, suffering from pestilence. In 1650, he became tutor in the house of Landschreiber Heinrich Sager at Heide, in Holstein. Two years later (1635) he was appointed pastor of the village of Wedel on the Elbe. The same year he married Elisabeth Stapel, sister of Franz Stapel, bailiff of nearby Pinneberg. They had 5 children, of whom 2 died early; Elisabeth died 1662. In 1664, he married Anna Hagedorn, born Badenhop, widow of his friend Phillipp Hagedorn. He died in Wedel on 31 August 1667. Work as a dramatist and poet Rist first made his name known to the literary world by a drama, Perseus (1634), which he wrote while at Heide, and in the next succeeding years he produced a number of dramatic works of which the allegory Das friedew√ºnschende Teutschland (1647) and Das friedejauchzende Teutschland (1653) (new ed. of both by H. M. Schletterer, 1864) are the most interesting. Rist soon became the central figure in a school of minor poets. The emperor Ferdinand III crowned him laureate in 1644, ennobled him in 1653, and invested him with the dignity of a Count Palatine, an honor which enabled him to the crown, and to gain numerous poets for the ' (Order of Elbe Swans), a literary and poetical society which he founded in 1660. He had already, in 1645, been admitted, under the name Daphnis aus Cimbrien, to the literary order of Pegnitz, and in 1647 he became, as Der R√ºstige, a member of the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft (\\"Fruitbearing Society\\"). Work as a hymn writer It is, however, as a writer of church hymns that Rist is best known. Among these several are still retained in the evangelical hymn book: e.g. O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort and Ermunt're dich, mein schwacher Geist. Collections of his poems appeared under the titles Musa Teutonica (1634) and Himmlische Lieder (1643). Johann Sebastian Bach composed two cantatas on O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort: BWV 60 (1723) using the first verse of the hymn, and the chorale cantata BWV 20 (1724) based on the entire chorale. Jesu, der du meine Seele, BWV 78 is another chorale cantata by Bach, based on the hymn with the same name by Rist. Rist's hymn \\"O Gottes Geist, mein Trost und Rat\\" is sung to the tune of \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\". Christiana Mariana von Ziegler included its ninth stanza in her libretto for Bach's cantata Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen, BWV 175.Luke Dahn. BWV 175.7 at , 2017 Rist's 1641/1642 hymn \\"Ein trauriger Grabgesang\\" is notable for being an early occurrence of the phrase \\"God is dead\\" in German culture, this time in an explicitly theistic, Protestant Christian context. The text goes: O gro√üe Not! Gott selbst ligt tot, Am Kreuz ist er gestorben.

Signs and symptoms Some of the symptoms that can occur with metabolic disorders are lethargy, weight loss, jaundice and seizures. The symptoms expressed would vary with the type of metabolic disorder. There are four categories of symptoms: acute symptoms, late-onset acute symptoms, progressive general symptoms and permanent symptoms. Causes Protein involved in Iron metabolism disorder (HFE) Inherited metabolic disorders are one cause of metabolic disorders, and occur when a defective gene causes an enzyme deficiency. These diseases, of which there are many subtypes, are known as inborn errors of metabolism. Metabolic diseases can also occur when the liver or pancreas do not function properly. = Types = The principal classes of metabolic disorders are: Diagnosis Gut microbiota Metabolic disorders can be present at birth, and many can be identified by routine screening. If a metabolic disorder is not identified early, then it may be diagnosed later in life, when symptoms appear. Specific blood and DNA tests can be done to diagnose genetic metabolic disorders. The gut microbiota, which is a population of microorganisms that live in the human digestive system, also has an important part in metabolism and generally has a positive function for its host. In terms of pathophysiological/mechanism interactions, an abnormal gut microbioma can play a role in metabolic disorder related obesity. Screening Metabolic disorder screening can be done in newborns via the following methods: * Blood test * Skin test * Hearing test Management Metabolic disorders can be treatable by nutrition management, especially if detected early.

This condition is most likely to develop secondary to congestive heart failure, following an increase in hydrostatic pressure within the lungs. More rarely, hydrothorax can develop in 10% of patients with ascites which is called hepatic hydrothorax. It is often difficult to manage in end-stage liver failure and often fails to respond to therapy. Pleural effusions may also develop following the accumulation of other fluids within the pleural cavity; if the fluid is blood it is known as hemothorax (as in major chest injuries), if the fluid is pus it is known as pyothorax (resulting from chest infections), and if the fluid is lymph it is known as chylothorax (resulting from rupture of the thoracic duct). Treatment Treatment of hydrothorax is difficult for several reasons. The underlying condition needs to be corrected; however, often the source of the hydrothorax is end stage liver disease and correctable only by transplant. Chest tube placement should not occur. Other measures such as a TIPS procedure are more effective as they treat the cause of the hydrothorax, but have complications such as worsened hepatic encephalopathy.

In 1955, he was the first African-American dancer with the New York City Ballet, where he was promoted to principal dancer the following year and danced in major roles until 1966. He then founded ballet companies in Spoleto, Washington, D.C., and Brazil. In 1969, he founded a training school and the first African-American classical ballet company, Dance Theatre of Harlem. Among other awards, Mitchell was recognized as a MacArthur Fellow, inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame, and received the United States National Medal of Arts and a Fletcher Foundation fellowship. Early life Mitchell was one of four siblings, the son of a building superintendent, and grew up in the streets of Harlem, New York. Forced at the age of 12 to assume financial responsibility for his family in the wake of his father's incarceration, Mitchell worked numerous jobs, including shoe-shining, mopping floors, newspaper delivery, and work in a meat shop. Despite his duties, Mitchell became involved with street gangs, though this did not ultimately deter him from finding success. As a teenager, Mitchell was encouraged by a guidance counselor to apply for admission to the High School of Performing Arts. Upon being accepted he decided to work towards having a career in classical ballet. Following his graduation in the early 1950s, he won a dance award and scholarship to study at the School of American Ballet, the school affiliated with the New York City Ballet. In 1954, following his 1952 Broadway debut in the opera Four Saints in Three Acts, Mitchell would return to Broadway to perform in the Harold Arlen musical House of Flowers, alongside Diahann Carroll, Geoffrey Holder, Alvin Ailey, Carmen de Lavallade, and Pearl Bailey.House of Flowers ibdb.com New York City Ballet In 1955 Mitchell made his debut as the first African American with the New York City Ballet (NYCB), performing in Western Symphony. Rising to the position of principal dancer with the company in 1956, he performed in all the major ballets in its repertoire, including A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Nutcracker, Bugaku, Agon, and Arcade. Choreographer and director of the NYCB George Balanchine created the pas de deux in Agon especially for Mitchell and the white Southern ballerina Diana Adams. Audience members initially complained about partnering Mitchell with a white woman, but Balanchine refused to change the pairing. Although Mitchell danced this role with white partners throughout the world, he could not perform it on commercial television in the United States until 1968, when the performance aired on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show.Arthur Mitchell, the-ballet.com; accessed March 27, 2016. Mitchell left the New York City Ballet in 1966 to appear in several Broadway shows, and helped found ballet companies in Spoleto, Washington, D.C., and Brazil, where he directed a dance company. The company he founded in Brazil was the National Ballet Company of Brazil. Dance Theatre of Harlem After the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, Mitchell returned to Harlem, where he was determined to provide opportunities in dance for the children in that community. A year later, he and his teacher, Karel Shook, inaugurated a classical ballet school.Arthur Mitchell, trailblazing US ballet dancer, dies at 84 The Guardian September 20, 2018 Mitchell had $25,000 of his own money to start the school. About a year later he received $315,000 in a matching funds grant from the Ford Foundation. The Dance Theatre of Harlem (DTH) was born in 1969 with 30 children in a church basement in a community where resources of talent and creative energy were virtually untapped. Two months later, Mitchell had attracted 400 youngsters to attend classes. Two years later they presented their first productions as a professional company. Mitchell used his personal savings to convert a garage into the company's home. In Harlem, DTH created an explosion of professional opportunity in dance, music, and other related theater activities. The school has an outstanding number of former students who have been successfully engaged in careers as dancers and musicians, as technicians in production, stagecraft, and wardrobe, and in instruction and arts administration. With this success, DTH challenged the classical dance world to review its stereotypes and revise its boundaries.

The 'City' station is the larger of the two, as it is on the better-connected Midland Main Line from London St Pancras, being served by Govia Thameslink trains on the Thameslink route. History The station was built by the Midland Railway in 1868, on its extension to St Pancras. St Albans was famous for producing watercress, which was sent in lots to London and Manchester. The other station, , was built by the London and North Western Railway in 1858. There was originally a further station called London Road, built by the Hatfield and St Albans Railway in 1863 to connect with the Great Northern Railway.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books =Station masters= *Joseph William Eden 1868 - 1877 *T.B.

There is a second exit to the west, to a small surface car park off Ridgmont Road and Victoria Street, located at the original entrance to the station. A larger surface car park to the east of the railway lines gained planning permission in 2003, in connection with a large residential development. There are ticket barriers at both entrances. The station participates in the Plusbus scheme where combined train and bus tickets can be bought at a reduced price. There is also a newsagent and refreshment shops. Just outside the station there is a flower stall.

The film opens in 1804 where seven vampires clad in gold masks who are resurrected by Count Dracula, played by John Forbes-Robertson. Next, Peter Cushing as Professor Van Helsing is hired in 1904 after giving a lecture at a Chinese University to take on the vampires. The film is a British-Hong Kong co- production between Hammer Film Productions and Shaw Brothers Studio. The film was shot between October 22 and December 11, 1973 at Shaw Brothers Studios in Hong Kong, where Chang Cheh was hired to direct further martial arts scenes for the films release in the East. The film was first released in Hong Kong and then in the United Kingdom with a shorter runtime. On its release in the United States, the film was truncated further and titled The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula. The film was a financial failure. Plot In Transylvania in 1804, a lone figure makes his way through the countryside and into the towering Castle Dracula, where he summons Dracula. The figure announces, in his own language, that his name is Kah, a Taoist monk and the High Priest of the Temple of the Seven Golden Vampires in rural China. He goes on to tell the Count that the Seven Golden Vampires' power is fading and he needs him to restore them to their former glory. Dracula considers the offer and accepts on one condition: that he uses Kah's body to escape his castle, which has become his prison. Despite Kah's pleas for mercy, the vampire displaces himself into Kah's body and then triumphantly leaves the tomb for China. In 1904 Professor Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) gives a lecture at a Chungking university on Chinese vampire legends. He speaks of an unknown rural village that has been terrorised by a cult of seven known as the Seven Golden Vampires for many years. A farmer who had lost his wife to the vampires trekked his way to the temple of the vampires and battled them. He was unsuccessful, as his wife was killed in the fight, but in the chaos he grabbed a medallion from around one of the vampire's necks, which he saw as the vampires' life source. The farmer fled the temple, but the High Priest sent the vampires and their former victims after him. About to be cornered, the farmer placed the medaillon around a small statue of a jade Buddha before the vampires and their army of undead caught up with him and killed him. One of the vampires spied the medallion around the Buddha and went over to collect it. However, the moment that the vampire touched the Buddha, the creature was destroyed in flames. Van Helsing goes on to say that he is positive that the village still exists and is terrorized by the six remaining vampires; he is only unsure of where the village lies. Most of the students disbelieve the story and leave, but a student named Hsi Ching (David Chiang) visits Van Helsing and informs him that the farmer from the story was his grandfather. He proves it by producing the dead vampire's bat-like medallion, and asks Van Helsing if he would be willing to travel to the village and destroy the vampire menace. Van Helsing agrees and embarks with his son Leyland (Robin Stewart), Hsi Ching, and his seven kung fu-trained siblings on a dangerous journey, funded by a wealthy widow named Vanessa Buren (Julie Ege), whom Leyland and two of Ching's siblings saved from an attack by the tongs. On the journey, they are ambushed by three of the six remaining vampires in a cave, along with their army of undead. The group are quickly engaged in battle and soon kill the three vampires. The remaining three retreat, taking their army of undead with them. The following morning, the party reaches the village, partly ruined but still populated, and prepares to make their final stand. They use wooden stakes as barriers and dig a large trench around them filled with flammable liquid. In the temple that evening, Dracula, still disguised as Kah, calls on the remaining vampires to kill Van Helsing and his party once and for all. The vampires reach the village, and soon Van Helsing's group once again do battle with the last of the golden vampires and their army of undead, resulting in nearly all of their party and the villagers being massacred. During the fight, Vanessa is bitten by one of the vampires and quickly becomes one herself. She bites Ching, and knowing what he has to do, Ching throws himself and Vanessa onto a wooden stake, impaling them both. Elsewhere, the last remaining vampire captures Ching's sister Mai Kwei (Shih Szu) and takes her back to the temple in order to be drained of her blood. Leyland steals a horse from one of the dead vampires and pursues. The army of undead defeated, Van Helsing and his remaining party follow to help Leyland at the temple. Having reached the temple, the vampire straps Mai Kwei to one of the altars. It is about to drain her blood when Leyland intervenes. Just before Leyland is about to be drained, Van Helsing and his group burst in, and Van Helsing destroys the last Golden Vampire. The survivors depart from the temple, save for Van Helsing, who feels a familiar presence and comes to face Dracula in Kah's body. Discovered, Dracula reveals his true form and attacks Van Helsing. In the ensuing struggle, Van Helsing succeeds in stabbing Dracula with a silver spear through the heart, causing the Count to turn to dust.

Houghton flew to Hong Kong discuss a project with Run Run Shaw and his brother Runme Shaw who agreed to finance 50% of the film. The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires was filmed between October 22 and December 11, 1973 at Shaw Brothers Studio in Hong Kong, with mountain scenes shot on Kowloon Peak. The Shaw Brothers were not happy with how Roy Ward Baker was directing the film and had martial arts sequences choreographed by one of their studios directors, leading to a second unit set up that was handled by Chang Cheh. Chang Cheh added scenes that led to Eastern version of the film to run at 110 minutes. Renee Glynee who was the continuity supervisor for the film stated that working with the Shaw Brothers Studios was \\"a big experience\\" due to language differences and that director Roy Ward Baker was screaming at the Chinese actors to stop spitting on set. Release The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires was first released in Hong Kong on July 11, 1974. The film received its premiere in London on August 29, 1974 at the Warner Rendezvous Theatre and had general release in the United Kingdom on October 6, 1974 by Columbia/Warner Distributors. The American version cuts out 20 minutes of the film's footage and soundtrack and loops several remaining scenes to fill the running time. For the films release in the United States, it received a Sneak Peak screening in November 1975 at the Famous Monsters of Filmland Convention in New York City which included attendance by Michael Carreras and Peter Cushing. It received wider distribution in the United States in June 1979 by Dynamite Entertainment with a 75-minute running time and re-titled to The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula. Under the guidance of Michael Carreras, an original edit of the film eliminated Dracula, but Carreras stated that the film was too short so Dracula's character was re-instated. In the film Dracula has the ability to assume another person's appearance, an ability that was removed from Houghton's script for The Satanic Rites of Dracula, and re-used in this film. The film was not a box office success. There was a planned sequel to be titled Kali, Devil Bride of Dracula, which was to be filmed in India, but it was never made. =Home media= The American DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment features both the original unedited The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires version and the later edited The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula version. The DVD also features a recording of Peter Cushing telling the story of the film with music and sound effects, which was released as an LP record at the time of the film's release. In April 2019, Scream Factory released a Blu-ray featuring a new 2K scan of the filmhttps://www.blu-ray.com/The-Legend- of-the-7-Golden-Vampires/188240/#Releases Reception In contemporary reviews, the London Times who found that the film \\"would be tedious if it were not for the distinguished presence of Peter Cushing as a Dracula-hunter and for some advanced exercises in the practice of vampire disintegration\\" Cinema TV Today found that \\"it is a pity that this blend of two popular genres could not have been more carefully thought out.\\" Verina Glaessner wrote in the Monthly Film Bulletin found the film to be a \\"fascinating failure\\" noting that \\"part of the film's failure is due to an equivocal attitude towards its subject, and part of a misunderstanding of the role that hand-to-hand combat plays in Chinese films.\\" From retrospective reviews, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club called the film \\"flawed\\" but \\"enjoyable,\\" adding, \\"It's pretty much as ridiculous as it sounds, but there's something inherently entertaining about make-up-splattered vampires, distinguished British actors, and martial artists squaring off in periodic eruptions of kung-fu fighting.\\" Phil Chandler of DVD Cult wrote, \\"Is it the best Hammer horror film ever made? Hell no. Is it the best Hammer film of the seventies? Hell yeah.\\" Graeme Clark of The Spinning Image said, \\"Cushing, in his last Hammer Dracula film, is as commanding as ever, but he and his Western companions are pretty disposable to the plot until the end, where the professor is left alone with the Count, who is hardly needed. Nevertheless, this last Hammer vampire outing has a real energy, in spite of being a mishmash, and is different enough to get by on sheer novelty alone.\\" Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called the raising of the undead army \\"one of the most visually spectacular in zombie cinema\\". Glenn Kay, who wrote Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide, called the film \\"boisterous, action-packed, and very likeable\\". Legacy Roy Ward Baker later spoke about the film, declaring that \\"the whole set-up was slip-shod, and nobody knew what anyone was doing.\\" and that the film was \\"a failure, an absolute failure.\\" Michael Carreras later said this \\"wasn't such a good idea\\" although he felt \\"some of the film is quite good.\\" See also * Vampire films References * External links  *The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires at BFI Screenonline Category:1974 films Category:1974 horror films Category:Hong Kong films Category:Hong Kong horror films Category:British films Category:British horror films Category:British martial arts films Category:1970s multilingual films Category:English-language films Category:Dracula films Category:Hammer Film Productions horror films Category:Films directed by Roy Ward Baker Category:Films set in China Category:Films set in 1804 Category:Films set in 1904 Category:Shaw Brothers Studio films Category:Hong Kong supernatural horror films Category:British multilingual films Category:Hong Kong multilingual films Category:British supernatural horror films Category:1974 martial arts films Category:Dracula (Hammer film series) ","title":"The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires"},{"id":"2280370","title":"1987 in baseball"},{"id":"2280392","title":"1988 in baseball"},{"id":"2280396","text":"Gum over platinum is a historical chemical photographic process, which was commonly used in art photography. It is a very complex process, in which a specially treated platinum print photograph is coated with washes of gum arabic, then re-exposed to the same photographic negative. The finished process results in a sepia toned print, and is said to impart added luminosity and depth. It is sometimes called \\"pigment over platinum\\". To sensitize the gum arabic it must first be placed in contact with ammonium or potassium dichromate. Gum arabic is not photosensitive by itself. To clear the chromic acid, the print is washed in 1% potassium metabisulfite after proper development in water. Interested individuals should read up on the process before attempting, as the chromic acids are very dangerous to work with. The mechanics of the gum portion is not entirely known; what occurs is the exposed gum is hardened and becomes water-insoluble. Upon washing, the unexposed portions wash away, leaving the white paper exposed. The technique is related to platinum printing.

Carl Ludwig Christian R√ºmker (28 May 1788 ‚Äì 21 December 1862) was a German astronomer. Early life (1788-1821) R√ºmker was born in Burg Stargard, in Mecklenburg, Germany, the son of J. F. R√ºmker, a court-councillor. He showed an aptitude for mathematics and studied at the Builders' Academy, Berlin, graduating in 1807 as a master builder. Instead of a career in building, he taught mathematics in Hamburg until 1809 when he went to England. R√ºmker served as a midshipman in the British East India Company and then in the British merchant navy from 1811 until 1813. In July 1813 he was seized by a pressgang and joined the Royal Navy. He served in the Royal Navy as a schoolmaster until 1817 on HMS Benbow, Montague and Albion taking part in the expedition to Algiers in 1816 whilst on the Albion. In 1817 he met Austrian astronomer Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who influenced R√ºmker to study astronomy. R√ºmker was director of the school of navigation at Hamburg from 1819 until 1820. Life in New South Wales (Australia) (1821-1830) In 1821 R√ºmker went to New South Wales as astronomer at the observatory built at Parramatta by Sir Thomas Brisbane. James Dunlop was second assistant. R√ºmker was awarded the silver medal of the Royal Astronomical Society together with ¬£100, for his re-discovery of Comet Encke on 2 June 1822 and also received the gold medal of the Institut de France. In June 1823 having fallen out with Brisbane he left the observatory. He had been granted of land on the west side of the Nepean River on the assurance that he would devote his time to scientific pursuits. Brisbane in a dispatch to Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst in November 1823 requested that the grant should not be confirmed beyond because R√ºmker had \\"completely broken\\" his promise.Historical Records of Australia, ser. I, vol. XI, p. 154 Bathurst, however, refused Brisbane's request, realizing that this would be a case of one man's word against another's if it were further investigated. After Brisbane's departure R√ºmker was placed in charge of the observatory by the government in May 1826, R√ºmker being the first to hold the title of government astronomer. It was intended that R√ºmker should measure the arc of the meridian; however it would have been necessary to obtain instruments from London and R√ºmker left the colony in January 1829. The results of his observations at Parramatta were published in Part III of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for 1829 and in the Royal Astronomical Society's Memoirs, Vol. III. R√ºmker also contributed an article to the Geographical Memoirs of New South Wales, edited by Barron Field, the first collection of scientific papers published in Australia. While in England, R√ºmker quarrelled with James South, president of the Royal Astronomical Society, who dismissed R√ºmker from British government service. Life in Hamburg, Germany (1830-1857) R√ºmker returned to Europe in 1830 and took charge of the new Hamburg Observatory after the death of Johann Georg Repsold in 1830. His chief work was concerned with the cataloging of stars: a preliminary catalogue of the stars of the Southern Hemisphere was published in 1832 at Hamburg, and from 1846 to 1852 he published his great catalogue of 12,000 stars. He served as the director of Hamburger Sternwarte then located at Stadtwall and funded by the city of Hamburg as Christian Karl Ludwig R√ºmker from 1833 to 1857.George F. J.

Lymph formed in the digestive system is called chyle and accumulates in the pleural space due to either disruption or obstruction of the thoracic duct. In people on a normal diet, this fluid collection can sometimes be identified by its turbid, milky white appearance, since chyle contains triglycerides. It is important to distinguish a chylothorax from a pseudochylothorax (a fluid collection in the pleural space that is high in cholesterol), which has a similar appearance, but is caused by more chronic inflammatory processes, and requires a different treatment. Chylothorax is a rare but serious condition. It results from leakage of lymph fluid from the thoracic duct or one of its tributaries. There are many treatments, both surgical and conservative. About 2-3% of all fluid collections surrounding the lungs (pleural effusions) are chylothoraces.  Signs and symptoms  The symptoms of a chylothorax depend its size and the underlying cause. A small chylothorax may not cause any symptoms and only be detected on a chest X-ray performed for another reason. A large chylothorax may lead to breathlessness or a feeling of pressure in the chest, caused by fluid restricting the expansion of the lungs, although large chylothoraces may remain asymptomatic if the chylothorax has accumulated slowly, as the lungs may have had time to become used to the pressure. Fever or chest pain are not usually associated with chylothorax, as chyle does not generate inflammation by itself. On examination, chylothorax may lead to reduced breath sounds on the affected side, associated with a dull sound when the chest is tapped or percussed. In cases of postoperative chylothorax, the first sign may be persistent drainage from intercostal drains. Large chylothoraces may cause signs related to the loss of nutrients, including features of malnutrition or decreased ability to fight infections. Rapidly accumulating chylothoraces can cause a sudden drop in blood volume, leading to low blood pressure. Causes There are three main types of chylothorax: traumatic, non-traumatic, and idiopathic. Historically the most common form of chylothorax was non-traumatic, but traumatic chylothoraces now represent the majority of cases, with most arising as postoperative complications of surgery. The most common cause of non- traumatic chylothoraces is cancer. Chylothoraces can also be classified as low- or high-output based on the rate of chyle accumulation: low-output chylothoraces accumulate <500 mL of chyle per 24 hours, while high-output chylothoraces accumulate >1000 mL per 24 hours. = Non-traumatic = Malignancies are the most frequent cause of non-traumatic chylothorax. Cancers like chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, metastatic carcinoma or esophageal cancer are potential causes of chylothorax. Infectious causes are also observed, most often in developing countries. The most common cause of an infectious chylothorax is a complication of tuberculous lymphadenitis. Other possible causative infections include aortitis, histoplasmosis, and filariasis. Chylothorax can also be congenital, and may co-occur with other lymphatic malformations like lymphangiectasis and lymphangiomatosis. Other conditions like tuberous sclerosis, congenital heart disease, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), Noonan syndrome, or Turner syndrome (missing X chromosome) are also possible causes of congenital chylothorax. Other, more rare causes of congenital chylothorax include Castleman's disease, yellow nail syndrome, Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, sarcoidosis, venous thrombosis, thoracic radiation, macroglobulinemia, amyloidosis, and a goiter. These diseases cause chylothorax by obstructing or destroying the thoracic duct. Also, parenteral nutrition has been a possible cause; a quick dose of total parenteral nutrition can overwhelm the thoracic duct, causing the chyle to leak into the surrounding pleural space. = Traumatic = Iatrogenic chylothorax after surgery is the most common variety of chylothorax. It is a common and serious complication of a pneumonectomy. It is especially common in surgeries requiring mediastinal dissection. The probability of chylothorax depends on the type of surgery. The surgery with the highest risk of chylothorax is an esophagostomy, with a 5-10% risk of chylothorax. Lung resection and mediastinal node dissection have the second highest risk, with 3-7% risk. Other operations like mediastinal tumor resection, thoracic aneurysm repair, sympathectomy, and any other surgeries that take place in the lower neck or the mediastinum can lead to chylothorax. Chylotharax after trauma but not after surgery has also been described after central line placement, pacemaker implantation, and embolization of a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. Blunt trauma to the chest region is another cause of chylothorax, which has occurred after blast injuries and even simple injuries from coughing or sneezing.  Mechanism  The main mechanism of chylothorax is the leaking of chyle from the thoracic duct, usually caused by a disturbance affecting the structural integrity of the thoracic duct. For example, placement of a central venous catheter can potentially disrupt drainage of lymph into the subclavian veins, followed by the thoracic duct, resulting in chylothorax. The disturbances cause the pressure in the thoracic duct to increase. Soon, collateral channels form, which eventually drain into the thorax.Talwar, Arunbh, and Hans J Lee. ‚ÄúA Contemporary Review of Chylothorax.‚Äù A Contemporary Review of Chylothorax, 2007, medind.nic.in/iae/t08/i4/iaet08i4p343.pdf. Trauma affecting the thoracic duct is the most common disturbing mechanism. Whether a chylothorax occurs in the left or right pleural space is a consequence of the thoracic duct's anatomic location in the body and depends on the level where the duct was injured. If the thoracic duct is injured above the fifth thoracic vertebra, then a left- sided chylothorax results. Conversely, a thoracic duct injury below that level will lead to the formation of a right-sided chylothorax. Chylothoraces most commonly occur in the right pleural space (50% of cases). Left-sided and bilateral chylothoraces are less common and occur in 33% and 17% of cases, respectively. In the case of cancer, invasion into the thoracic duct or collateral lymph channels can obstruct lymph. In the case of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the enlarged lymph node causes compression of the lymphatic channels and thoracic duct. This impedes the centripetal drainage of the flow of lymph from the edges of the lung parenchyma and pleural surfaces. This causes the chyle to ooze extensively into the pleural cavity, leading to a chylothorax. In the case of yellow nail syndrome, or lymphedema, chylothorax is caused by hypoplasia or dilation of the lymph vessels. In rare cases, like in hepatic chylothorax, chylous ascites crosses the diaphragm into the pleural cavity. In idiopathic cases like genetic disorders, the mechanism is not known. Up to three liters of chyle can easily drain into the pleural space daily.  Diagnosis  Bilateral chylothorax seen on a thoracic MRI CT scan showing extensive chylothorax caused by leakage from the thoracic duct Chest X-rays can detect a chylothorax. It appears as a dense, homogenous area that obscures the costophrenic and cardiophrenic angles. Ultrasounds can also detect a chylothorax, which appears as an echoic region that is isodense with no septation or loculation. However, neither a normal chest x-ray nor an ultrasound can differentiate a chylothorax from any other type of pleural effusion. The cisterna chyli can be found in a thoracic MRI, making it possible to confirm chylothorax. However, MRI is not the ideal method to scan the thorax, and so it is rarely used. Another diagnostic technique is conventional lymphangiography. It is rarely used since there are equally sensitive yet less invasive techniques available to identify a chylothorax. Lymphangiography procedures use the contrast dye agent lipiodol, which is injected into the lymphatic vessels. The chylothorax shows up on the images and identifies the source any leak in the thoracic duct. Another, more commonly used type of lymphogram is nuclear lymphoscintigraphy; this procedure requires human pentetic acid labeled Tc99m to be injected into the subcutaneous lesions of both sides of the dorsum of the foot. Then two images, anterior and posterior, are obtained using gamma-ray cameras. This test can be used with an integrated low-dose CT-scan with photon emission to get images that are more precise. Once pleural effusion is detected, a thoracentesis is recommended. The fluid of a chylothorax may appear milky, serous or serosanguineous. If the appearance of the fluid is not milky, that does not exclude a chylothorax from consideration. Since chyle is rich in triglycerides, a pleural effusion that is rich in triglycerides (>110 mg/dL) confirms the presence of a chylothorax; a pleural effusion that is low in triglyceride content (<50 mg/dL) virtually excludes the diagnosis. If a pleural effusion contains triglycerides between 50-110 mg/dL, analysis of the lipoprotein content of the pleural effusion to evaluate for chylomicrons is recommended. If that procedure detects chylomicrons in the fluid, that confirms a chylothorax. Chylothoraces are typically exudative and often contain a high number of lymphocytes and have low levels of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). However, atypical chylothoraces can occur and are transudative in 14% of cases. A milky appearance of pleural fluid is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis of chylothorax as pseudochylothoraces and empyemas can mimic this appearance. Conversely, the absence of a milky appearance does not mean a chylothorax is not present as they may instead appear serous or bloody. Treatment Three bottles of chyle drained from a chylothorax The treatment for chylothorax depends on the underlying cause but may include dietary modification, medication to prevent chyle formation including somatostatin/octreotide, midodrine and sirolimus, pleurodesis, and surgical treatment including ligation of the thoracic duct, pleurovenous or pleuroperitoneal shunting or thoracic duct embolization. = Initial = The initial treatment of a chylothorax is usually drainage of the fluid from the pleural space. This may be necessary to restore lung function compromised by the pressure exerted by the chyle on the lungs. Those with large chylothoraces may need nutritional support due to the nutrients lost, primarily to correct protein and electrolyte losses. Once the affected person is hemodynamically and nutritionally stable, then specific treatment can begin. = Conservative = A conservative treatment is changing diet to include fewer long-chain fatty acids, in particular free fatty acids. Since chyle is formed from these acids, chyle formation will reduce, allowing the defects to heal spontaneously. However, this can lead to fat deficiency and malnutrition over time. A possible response to this drawback is a venous fat hemorrhage, in which small and medium-chain fatty acids are given by diet, and long-chain fatty acids are given intravenously. Thoracentesis and an indwelling catheter for use at home is generally used to drain the chylothorax. If a malignant neoplastic chylothorax is present, then treatment with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy is warranted. = Surgical = Surgery is indicated if the case is post-traumatic, iatrogenic, or refractory to other treatments, in which cases surgery reduces mortality by 40%. One invasive surgical intervention called a thoracic duct ligation involves closing off the thoracic ducts. Surgical pleurodesis is another option and can be undertaken if the affected person fails to respond to conservative treatment and is not a candidate for surgical intervention. Another treatment option is pleuroperitoneal shunting (creating a communication channel between the pleural space and peritoneal cavity). Since surgery to close the leak is not reliable, talc pleurodesis is recommended; in a case study of 19 people with refractory malignant chylothorax due to lymphoma, it resulted in success for all affected individuals. Chemical pleurodesis is an option, since the leaking of lymphatic fluids is stopped by irritating the lungs and chest wall, resulting in a sterile inflammation. This causes the lung and the chest wall to fuse together, thus preventing lymphatic fluids from leaking into the pleural space.  Prognosis  The morbidity and mortality rates associated with chylothorax have declined as treatments have improved. Malignant, bilateral, and chronic chylothoraces have an inferior prognosis to other types. Currently, the mortality and morbidity rates are about 10% if treated surgically. If cases are post-operative and treated conservatively, mortality rates approach 50%. = Complications = Complications of chylothorax include malnutrition, immunosuppression, dehydration, and respiratory distress. The severity of the complications depends on how quickly the chylothorax accumulated, its size, and its chronicity.  Epidemiology  Chylothoraces are rare and usually occur as a complication of surgeries in the neck and mediastinum. It has no gender or age predisposition. A chylothorax occurs in 0.2-1% of cardiothoracic surgeries, 5-10% of esophagostomies, and 3-7% of lung resections.

She was badly damaged by , losing 313 men and receiving 233 round shots in her hull. On 17 May 1795, she was renamed Peuple; a month later, on 23 June she fought in the Battle of Groix as Villaret's flagship. Returning to Lorient three days later, she was officially renamed to Oc√©an, a name that had been in use since 30 May. She was refitted in Brest in 1797. In 1801, she once again served as Villaret's flagship, ferrying troops of Leclerc's expedition to Saint-Domingue. Oc√©an was Allemand's flagship at the Battle of the Basque Roads. She was decommissioned on 2 August 1850, and used as a floating artillery battery from May 1851.

In 1372 Frankfurt bought the city forest from Emperor Charles IV and wanted to regain these rights. This sparked a hundred-year fight with the Knights, which ended with a compromise in 1484. The city paid a sum to graze sheep on the land, but the area was limited. One can still see the stones of the border on the Sch√§fersteinpfad, Shepherd Stone Path. The use of the forest by farmers for grazing is still evident in the names, Unterschwein- und Oberschweinstiege, which were overnight stables for the acorn and beech nut eating pigs.

In these fairs newly married couples come to tie the nuptial knot again before the goddess .The Mundan ceremony of small children is also performed here. After reaching the temple and waiting for a long lakhs of Devotes light the \\"Jyot\\" of desi ghee and offer coconut and parsad to the goddess. Here, after the government has taken the charge of the temple, continuous efforts have been made to beautify the temple. With devotion and faith, the devotees arrive here, It seems that Beri is not less important than any other religious places devoted to goddess Devi‚Äôs chanting. In the Beri the enhancing of goddess‚Äôs name echoes all the time. According to the well-known story, it is named, Bhimeshwari due to the installation of the idol of the goddess by Bhima. According to the saying before the beginning of the battle of the Mahabharta period Shri Krishna told Mahabali Bhima to bring his Kuldevi to the battlefield of the Kurukshetra and take the blessing from her. According to the order of Shri Krishna and his brother \\"Yudhistar\\" , Bhima approached the Hinglay Mountain ( Which is now in Pakistan ) and prayed the kuldevi to move to the battle field for victory. The goddess accepted the request of Bhima but laid down a condition, she said that she was ready to go with him but if he dropped me down on the way from the lap then she would not proceed further. In the way Bhima felt the desire to go to toilet so he placed the idol of the goddess under a tree of Beri from his lap and went on, after toilet, he also felt thirsty but he could not find any water near by. Bhima blowed the earth with his gada to take out water and took bath. After that when he tried to lift the goddess than he remained her condition, under compulsion, Bhima placed the goddess near the bank of the pond and went to Kurukshetra after seeking the blessing for victory. After 18 days of war when Kaurva‚Äôs got killed Gandhari reached the place screaming. Often said that here only Shri Krishna took out from the illusion. When Gandhari passed from there she saw her own kuldevi. After that she erected the temple here. Although the ruins of the temple erected by Gandhari are not present now, but of the seat of the great goddess is still there. Presently, marvelous temple is here. In Beri, there are two temples. The process of moving the goddess from outer to inner temple has been going on since the Mahabharta period. At that time there was a dense forest. Maharishi Durvasa was residing in Dubaldhan around 8 km from here in fear of thieves. Every morning at 5 a.m. Mahrishi Dhurava would bring the idol of goddess in the outer temple in his lap and at 12:00 noon again he would return it in the inner temple. The process of moving of goddess from inner to outer temple is still going on. The aarti sung by durvasa is still enchanted everyday and every evening. The \\" Akhand Jyoti\\" for 24 hrs is enlightening. also said to be City of temples and Religious City in Haryana State. The City Has around 100 Small and large Temples.

At , it is one of the longest surface routes operated by the TTC, the longest streetcar route operating in Canada and one of the longest streetcar routes operating in the world. It stretches from Long Branch Loop (just west of Browns Line, adjacent to Long Branch GO Station) in the west to Neville Park Loop (just west of Victoria Park Avenue) in the east, running on Lake Shore Boulevard, in a reserved right-of-way at the median of the Queensway, and on Queen Street. History In 1875, the Kingston Road Tramway operated a horsecar service along what would become today's Queen Street East. This line was abandoned in the mid 1880s, at about which time the Toronto Street Railway extended its King horsecar line onto Queen Street East to Lee Avenue in The Beaches district. In 1893, the Toronto Railway Company electrified the line. In 1921, the TTC took over streetcar service. From 1923 to 1928, the Beach streetcar line ran along Queen Street from Neville Park Boulevard to the Humber River similar to today's 501 Queen. At about this time, there was also a route named \\"Queen\\", but it ran along Kingston Road to McCaul and Queen streets much like today's 502 Downtowner. From 1928 to 1937, service to the eastern and western ends of Queen Street was handled by separate routes. Thus, one would need to transfer streetcars in the downtown area to travel the full length of Queen Street. On August 2, 1937, a new Queen route served all of Queen Street between Neville Park Loop and Parkside Loop. (The Parkside Loop was located at the northeast corner of Lakeshore Boulevard and Parkside Drive, south of the rail corridor, which was crossed by a bridge.) East of Roncesvalles Avenue, the Queen route resembled today's 501 Queen. On September 14, 1940, PCC streetcars were introduced on the Queen route on Sundays, displacing Peter Witt streetcars. PCCs were placed in Queen night service on October 3, 1940, and in regular daily service on May 1, 1941. By 1954, when the Yonge subway (today part of Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity) opened, an underground streetcar station was partially built at Queen station to eventually allow streetcars to cross under the subway tracks. The plan was to put the Queen streetcar line in a tunnel under Queen Street between Logan Avenue and Trinity Park. However, because of changing ridership patterns, the plan was dropped in favour of east-west subway line along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue (today's Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth). Today, Lower Queen remains a ghost station. In 1957, to accommodate construction of the Gardiner Expressway, the streetcar tracks were removed from Lake Shore Boulevard between Roncesvalles Avenue and the Humber River, and the bridge crossing the rail corridor was demolished. As a replacement, a new private right-of-way was built along the Queensway from the Sunnyside Loop to the Humber Loop. At the Humber Loop, passengers could transfer to the Long Branch streetcar which shuttled between the Humber and Long Branch loops. Between 1967 and early 1977, two-car multiple-unit PCC trains served the Queen streetcar route. On March 26, 1995, the 507 Long Branch route was replaced by a westward extension of the 501 Queen route. At this point, 501 Queen was at its maximum and present-day length. In 2013, the TTC considered setting up a transit mall on the downtown portion of either Queen or King Street. TTC CEO Andy Byford wanted a car-free corridor along one of the city's two busiest streetcar lines (either 501 Queen or 504 King) to prevent bunching, gaps and service delays. Byford would ban general automobile traffic along the streetcar corridor but allow cyclists, taxicabs and delivery trucks. Byford preferred King Street for the transit mall because of recent condominium development along that street. There were similar proposals for a transit mall in 2001 and 2007. Ultimately, the King Street Transit Priority Corridor was established in late 2017. In January 2017, construction began for approximately 15 months on various projects west of Roncesvalles Avenue, including rebuilding the bridge over the Humber River carrying streetcar tracks. Other work included replacing track and overhead along portions of The Queensway and Lake Shore Boulevard as well as at the Humber Loop. Also at the Humber Loop, a new substation was built, platforms were made accessible to accommodate Flexity streetcars and a siding on the west-to-east loop was modified. In April 2018, streetcar operations resumed between Sunnyside Loop and Humber Loop. Streetcar service between Humber Loop and Long Branch Loop resumed in June 2018. From May to September 2017, all streetcar service over the entire 501 Queen route was replaced by buses to permit multiple construction projects along Queen Street, including the replacement of an overhead pedestrian walkway at the Eaton Centre, which required overhead wires to be removed. According to TTC spokesperson, it would take 65 buses to replace the 50 streetcars then operating east of the Sunnyside Loop. =Rolling stock= ALRVs once provided base service on 501 Queen (photo at Maclean Ave) Route 501 Queen was once served mainly by Articulated Light Rail Vehicles (ALRVs) and occasionally supplemented with some of the shorter Canadian Light Rail Vehicles (CLRVs). However, by 2018, the route was mainly served by CLRVs. This was due to the declining reliability and accelerated retirement of the ALRV fleet. Flexity Outlook streetcars were introduced on the 501 Queen route in phases; weekend service using the Flexity vehicles along the route began in September 2018 and moved to full-time on January 6, 2019. The TTC had to address rush-hour crowding due to the accelerated retirement of the ALRV fleet, the last of which made their final voyages on September 2, 2019. By June 23, 2019, the main portion of the route (along Queen Street and The Queensway between Humber Loop and Neville Park Loop) was the first to be fully served by accessible Flexity Outlook streetcars; the southwest portion of the route (along Lake Shore Boulevard between Humber and Long Branch Loop) followed suit on September 1, 2019. =507 Long Branch= PCC on the Long Branch route at Long Branch Loop in 1966 Route 507 Long Branch was a streetcar route that ran along Lake Shore Boulevard West between Humber Loop and Long Branch Loop. Since 1995, the line has been served by the 501 Queen route. Until September 27, 1928, service along Lake Shore Boulevard west of Humber Loop was provided by the single- track Mimico radial line which continued west to Port Credit. Starting from that date, the TTC replaced the radial track to Long Branch with a double- track streetcar line. On December 8, 1928, the Lake Shore streetcar service (not the same as the later 508 Lake Shore) began operation from downtown Toronto to Long Branch Loop where, until 1937, passengers could transfer to the shortened Port Credit radial line. An extra fare was required to travel from west of Humber Loop to downtown. On October 28, 1935, the Lake Shore streetcar route was split, and the new Long Branch route was created to run between Long Branch Loop and Roncesvalles Carhouse. In 1958, when a new reserved streetcar right-of-way was opened on the Queensway, the Long Branch route (later called 507 Long Branch) was cut back operating mainly west of Humber Loop. On January 1, 1973, passengers could transfer between the Long Branch and Queen streetcars at Humber Loop without paying an extra fare. On September 30, 1979, Long Branch (by now 507 Long Branch) became the first route to employ the then-new CLRV in revenue service. On January 19, 1988, 507 Long Branch was also the first route to employ the ALRV in revenue service. On March 26, 1995, the TTC merged the 507 Long Branch route into 501 Queen, making one continuous route from Neville Park Loop in the east to Long Branch Loop. =Route splitting=2009 split By 2007, critics of the TTC's management of this line argue that small delays at one end ripple into 30-40 minute waits at the other. Like route 504, there is much demand at either end of the route, and along the downtown middle stretch. Transit proponents such as Steve Munro have long claimed that Route 501 would be better off if it were split into two or three overlapping segments. In late 2009, the TTC conducted an experiment of splitting the 501 streetcar route into two overlapping segments, as recommended by critics to alleviate bunching, gaps and short turns when delays occurred. During the experiment streetcars from the Neville Park Loop ran west on Queen Street as far as Shaw Street, and from Long Branch Loop or Humber Loop east as far as Parliament Street. In January 2010, the commission received a report analyzing several of the experiments done in 2009 to increase service reliability. It was determined that splitting the route increased short turns by 90%, required more streetcars and resulted in poorer service. The TTC decided to use a route-management system called Step Forward, whereby when an operator goes off duty (break or end of shift), another operator takes over the streetcar instead of the streetcar going out of service along with off-duty operator. According to the TTC, Step Forward reduced short turns in late 2007, from 32.5% to 9.7% in the PM rush hours, and from 13.9% to 4.1% in the AM rush. It also was successful in reducing service gaps according to the TTC. Implementing Step Forward required eight extra operators and two extra supervisors. 2016 split By 2015, passengers were complaining about service on the 501 streetcar. Streetcars would often arrive at irregular intervals, causing unscheduled waits of 20‚Äì30 minutes. Streetcars would also do unscheduled short turns at Kingston Road or Roncesvalles Avenue, forcing passengers to exit and wait for the next streetcar. To address these problems and make service more predictable for riders, the TTC again split the 501 Queen route. On January 3, 2016, the route was split into two sections at Humber Loop. The split is in effect only from 5am to 10pm. During the split, service over the entire route operates at intervals of ten minutes or better. The change was also made to provide more frequent service on each segment and to eliminate all but emergency short turns (such as for an accident) on the segment east of Humber Loop. Transfer- free service through Humber Loop was still provided by 3 runs in the morning, in the late evening and overnight. Some riders reported shorter streetcar wait times after the split. The split was suspended starting from January 8, 2017, due to construction projects affecting Humber Loop. When streetcar service west of Humber Loop resumed on June 24, 2018, the split was reinstated. Initially, the TTC provided five transfer-free trips during the morning peak period; however, effective September 2, 2018, the TTC temporarily suspended these five runs due to a shortage of streetcars. Route From Neville Park Loop, the route proceeds westward in mixed traffic on Queen Street East. At Kingston Road, passengers can transfer to the 502 Downtowner and 503 Kingston Rd streetcars. Further west, Broadview Avenue provides a transfer point to the 504 King streetcars to go along King Street. At Yonge Street, the route passes Queen station on subway Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity. After crossing Yonge Street, the route continues on Queen Street West. At University Avenue, the route passes Osgoode station again on Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity. At Spadina Avenue, riders can transfer to 510 Spadina streetcars, and at Bathurst Street, to 511 Bathurst streetcars. The route continues to the western end of Queen Street West at the intersection of King Street West and Roncesvalles Avenue where riders can again transfer to 504 King streetcars. Beyond Roncesvalles Avenue, Queen Street West flows onto The Queensway, where 501 Queen streetcars run in their own right-of-way until reaching the off-street Humber Loop. Leaving Humber Loop, the line passes through a short streetcar tunnel under a railway corridor and the Gardiner Expressway. The line emerges from the tunnel onto Lake Shore Boulevard West and proceeds westward in mixed traffic to Long Branch Loop where the route terminates. =Sites along the line (from east to west)= * The Beaches * Moss Park and Moss Park Armoury * Toronto Eaton Centre * Old City Hall * Toronto City Hall and Nathan Phillips Square * Osgoode Hall * Four Seasons Centre * 299 Queen Street West (Home to MuchMusic, CP24, Bell Media) * Trinity Bellwoods Park * Centre for Addiction and Mental Health * Drake Hotel * Gladstone Hotel * Parkdale * High Park * Humber Bay Park * Colonel Samuel Smith Park * Humber College, Lakeshore Campus Operation the split at Humber Loop was temporarily suspended. As a result, most 501 Queen streetcars operate the full route between Neville Park and Long Branch loops. This route operates as part of the TTC's Blue Night Network operating from about 1 am to 5 am under the 301 Queen banner. In popular culture Toronto's Brickworks Ciderhouse produces a semi-sweet cider called the \\"Queen Street 501\\" which is an homage to the streetcar route, as well as Queen Street in general.

Left wing parties, whether advocating socialism, Marxism or agrarianism, provoked hostility from the mainstream political parties, oligarchs and military alike, and many were either banned or went underground soon after formation. Although occasionally winning a seat in the lower house of the Diet of Japan, left- socialist parties played little role in the government of the Empire of Japan. Early development of leftist politics The ideology of socialism was introduced to Japan in the early Meiji period, largely via Christian missionaries with their concepts of universal fraternity, but had little attraction until the increased industrialization of Japan had created a disaffected urban labor force which became more receptive to calls for a more equitable distribution of wealth, increased public services and at least some nationalization of the means of production. The early Freedom and People's Rights Movement founded in 1873 is also regarded as a forerunner to Japanese socialist development for its attraction to the labor movement and agrarian movement and increased representative democracy; however, it was more concerned with Constitutional development than social consciousness. The Meirokusha think tank, also founded in 1873 is also regarded as a forerunner to Japanese socialist development, due to the support of many of its members for social change. However, the political outlook of most of its members was more liberal than socialist. Socialism in the Empire of Japan The was founded in October 1896, members included Isoo Abe, K≈çtoku Sh≈´sui and Sen Katayama. It was reorganized in 1901 into Japan‚Äôs first socialist political party, the . The government outlawed the new party two days after its formation. The was founded on 28 January 1906 as a coalition representing a wide spectrum of socialist beliefs. The radical element was led by K≈çtoku Sh≈´sui, an anarcho-syndicalist, who favored direct action and strikes, while the moderates were led by Sen Katayama and Tatsuji Tazoe, who favoured a mild program of social reform. This coalition was unstable, and collapsed after only a year, on 22 February 1908. The various factions went on to create small, short-lived political parties, many of which came under police scrutiny and were suppressed under the increasingly restrictive Peace Preservation Laws. The execution of Kotoku Shusui in the aftermath of the High Treason Incident in 1911 was also a severe blow to the early socialist movement. The next few years were known as \\"the winter years\\" of socialism in Japan as political activity was next to none. Other early socialist parties included: * (1926‚Äì1928) * (1926‚Äì1928) * (1926‚Äì1932) * (1919‚Äì1940) * (1932‚Äì1940) * (1937) Democratic socialism and social democracy in the Empire of Japan Moderates who favoured mild reforms followed thinkers like Minobe Tatsukichi and Sakuz≈ç Yoshino, both professors at Tokyo Imperial University. Both felt that the Emperor system and other elements of Japan's traditional kokutai were compatible with democracy and socialism. Yoshino went on to found his own political party with a mix of Christian socialism, Confucian public morality, and syndicalism. Along with Tokuz≈ç Fukuda of Keio University, Yoshino joined with others to establish Reimeikai, which was a society \\"to propagate ideas of democracy among the people.\\"Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Reimeikai\\" in . This group was formed in order to sponsor public lectures.Marshall, Byron K. (1992). The movement initially attracted many students and worker leaders. The party collapsed in 1920.Smith, Henry DeWitt. (1972). Communism in the Empire of Japan Release of Communist Party Members from prison, 1945 The (JCP) was founded on 15 July 1922, as an underground branch of Comintern by a group of socialist activists, including Hitoshi Yamakawa, Kanson Arahata, Toshihiko Sakai, Kyuichi Tokuda and Sanz≈ç Nosaka. Outlawed at once under the Peace Preservation Law, the JCP was subjected to repression and persecution by the military and police. The party was dominated by Hitoshi Yamakawa in its early years, but Yamakawa had the party formally dissolved in 1924, stating that the time was not right for a communist party in Japan. Also in 1924, Kazuo Fukumoto returned to Japan after studying Marxism in Germany and France, and scathingly attacked Yamakawa's approach, citing a need for the formation of a vanguard party on the Leninist model. He presided over the re- establishment of the JCP in 1926. The difference between Yamakawa and Fukumoto was both theoretical and practical, as Yamakawa wanted to avoid discussing the Emperor system and whether it represented feudalism (as the Comintern and Fukumoto thought) or if it was no different from the English Monarchy as Yamakawa maintained. On 15 July 1927, the Comintern issued a thesis attacking both Yamakawa and Fukumoto and demanding that the party strive for an immediate two-stage revolution to overthrow the Japanese government, and especially the Emperor system and Diet of Japan, redistribution of wealth and favourable policy with Soviet Russia. In the March 15 Incident of 1928 and April 16 Incident of 1929, thousands of suspected communists were arrested nationwide. In a special open trial of the Tokyo District Court in 108 sessions from 25 June 1931 to 2 July 1932, some 300 members of the JCP were sentenced. The trial was carefully orchestrated by the Home Ministry (Japan) to expose the inner workings of the JCP and its strategy to undermine the existing political order. All defendants were found guilty and were given stiff sentences, but those who publicly recanted (tenk≈ç) their communist ideology and who agreed to rehabilitation were given much reduced sentences. In 1931, the underground JCP issued a new thesis calling for an immediate socialist revolution. This radical approach led to a fracturing of the JCP leadership, attacks from social democrats, and more repression from the government. Overseas aid from Comintern not being forthcoming (the JCP was suspected of being infected with Trotskyism by its Soviet counterparts), the Japanese communist movement virtually ceased to exist after 1935 with the arrest of its leadership and dissolution of supporting organizations. It would not be reestablished until after the war. NotesReferences  * * Marshall, Byron K. (1992). Academic Freedom and the Japanese Imperial University, 1868‚Äì1939.

The treaty laid out a western boundary for American settlement. The treaty gave rise to the sardonic Cherokee phrase of Talking Leaves, since they claimed that when the treaties no longer suited the Americans, they would blow away like talking leaves. A description of the boundary is found on Article 4 of the accord: Included in the signatures of the Cherokee delegation were several from leaders of the Chickamauga (Lower Cherokee), including two from the town of Chickamauga itself and one from Lookout Mountain Town. The Cherokee complained at the treaty that some 3,000 white settlers of the de facto State of Franklin were already squatting on the Cherokee side of the agreed line, between the Holston and French Broad Rivers, and they continued to dispute that region until a new border was defined by the 1791 Treaty of Holston.Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee, p. 61 ff. 1785‚Äì1786 U.S. Representative Andrew Pickens =Cherokee= On November 28, 1785, the first Treaty of Hopewell was signed between U.S. representatives Benjamin Hawkins, Andrew Pickens, and Joseph Martin and members of the Cherokee People.

They primarily inhabit the littoral and southwest region of Cameroon and form a portion of the Sawabantu or \\"coastal people\\" of Cameroon. The Dualas readily welcomed German and French colonial policies The number of German-speaking Africans increased in four West African German colonies prior to 1914. The Duala leadership in 1884 placed the tribe under German rule. Most converted to Protestantism and were schooled along German lines. Colonial officials and businessmen preferred them as inexpensive clerks to German government offices and firms in Africa.Jonathan Derrick, \\"The 'Germanophone' Elite of Douala under the French Mandate.\\" Journal of African History (1980): 255-267 online. They have historically played a highly influential role in Cameroon due to their long contact with Europeans, high rate of education, and wealth gained over centuries as slave traders and landowners. Sawa Dance Group The Duala are related to several ethnic groups (or tribes) in the Cameroon Coastal areas, with whom they share a common traditional origin, and similar histories and cultures. These include the Ewodi, the Bodiman, the Pongo, the Bakole, the Bakweri (or Kwe), the Bamboko, the Isubu (Isuwu or Bimbians), the Limba (or Malimba), the Mungo, the Wovea and the Oroko (or Balondo), they are generally known as the SAWA people. The Batanga of the region of Kribi could be added to the preceding list as they claim they are descendants of Mbedi and they report some degree of mutual comprehension between their own language and Malimba. Moreover, the Oroko language is classified as a Duala language, seems to be closely related to Bakweri (Mokpwe), which is a Duala language. Thus the Kundu, Lue, Mbonge, Ekombe, Londo ba Nanga, Londo ba Diko, Ngolo, Bima, Tanga and Koko are Duala peoples. The Duala have dominated the others historically, and these other groups all profess some sort of kinship to them. In addition, many other coastal ethnic groups such as Balong, Bakossi and so on ‚Äî who are culturally and historically more or less related to the Duala ‚Äî are under Duala influence, and most of these people speak Duala to some extent. Duala is also spoken by a great part of the Bassa and Bakoko people. The word \\"Duala\\" may refer to the Duala \\"proper\\" or to the whole set of Duala-like tribes or even possibly to some \\"duala-ized\\" Bassa, Bakoko or Manenguba tribes. History=Early population movements= Wouri River Early Duala history may only be conjectured from oral traditions. The Duala trace their ancestry back to a man named Mbedi, who lived in an area called Bakota in what is today Gabon or the Republic of the Congo. His sons, Ewale and Dibombo, migrated north and reached a place called Pitti on the Dibamba River. Here, the brothers parted ways after a row. Ewale moved to the mouth of the Dibamba with his followers and then northwest to the east bank of Wouri River estuary. Meanwhile, Dibongo and his companions migrated southeast to the Sanaga River and then split up, some heading upstream with Dibongo and others moving downstream with a man named Elimbe. Ewale's people became the Duala, and Dibongo's the Limba. According to Duala traditions, the Bakoko and Bassa ethnic groups occupied the Wouri estuary when the Duala arrived. The Duala then drove them inland, a displacement that likely occurred in the late 17th or early 18th century. =Early history= King Akwa, 1875 The Duala emerged by the 16th century as the leading traders on the Cameroonian coast, though the Isubu and Limba did not trail far behind. The earliest Duala merchants were likely chiefs or headmen. The Duala had long kept and traded slaves, who lived in separate settlements and performed menial tasks such as cultivation. Slave owners could only trade their slaves to other Duala, however, and owners were responsible for paying their slaves' debts and arranging their marriages. With the Europeans providing such a hungry market, however, these customs gave way. Monument of King Akwa The main Duala villages soon grew into a prospering township named Douala for the people who lived there. The coastal Duala purchased goods and slaves from interior groups such as the Bakweri, Mungo, Bassa and Bakoko. In turn, they sold these items to the Europeans, typically aboard their ships (and later at mainland factories or stores). In exchange, the Europeans provided alcohol, gunpowder, guns, mirrors, shoes, textiles, and tools. Ndumb'a Lobe of the Bell lineage propped himself up in the 19th century as King Bell. Heads of rival sub-lineages soon rivalled him, including the self-styled King Akwa (Ngando Mpondo) in 1814, King Deido (Jim Ekwalla) of the Deido (an Akwa splinter group), and Prince Lock Priso (Kum'a Mbape) of the Bonaberi. By the mid-19th century, the British had taken the lead in trade with the Duala. This coincided with the abolition movement, and the Crown employed the traders to end slavery in the Gulf of Guinea. On 10 June 1840 and 7 May 1841, Akwa and Bell became the first to sign anti-slavery treaties. In exchange, the Europeans provided these rulers with annual gifts of alcohol, guns, textiles, and other goods. In addition, the rulers outlawed practices the British viewed as barbaric, such as sacrificing a chief's wives upon his death. The British also wanted to mould the Duala to their own concepts of civilization. This meant educating them in Western learning and converting them to Christianity. Alfred Saker opened a mission in Douala in 1845. By 1875, numerous missions and schools sprung up in Douala and other settlements. The early missionaries learned the Duala language and invented a written form for it, as Bible translation was one of their earliest priorities. Cameroonian Pidgin English began to develop at this time. Trade dramatically altered Duala society. European goods became status symbols, and some rulers appointed Western traders and missionaries as advisors. A high proportion of Duala grew wealthy through the new trade, and tensions arose between the haves and have- nots. Competition escalated between coastal groups and even between related settlements. Traders exploited this atmosphere and beginning in 1860, German, French, and Spanish merchants had established contacts and weakened the British monopoly. The Duala had gained a virtual hegemony over trade through the Wouri estuary. In response to the threat from foreign merchants, the British put pressure on the Duala kings to request British annexation. In 1879, King Akwa sent such a request; Bell followed suit in 1881 (some historians believe that these documents were faked, however). When King Pass All of the Limba ceded his territories to the French, British traders expressed the urgency of annexing the Duala territories to the Crown. In July 1884, however, German explorer Gustav Nachtigal staged a coup by signing land- cessation treaties with Kings Akwa, Bell, and Deido. The British arrived too late and on 28 March 1885 ceded Victoria to Germany. =German administration= Rudolf Duala Manga Bell, hanged for high treason for opposing German land expropriations Opposition to German rule followed the annexation. Prince Lock Priso still favored the British and staged a rebellion in December 1884. Around this same time, King Bell faced off against his own people, who were largely opposed to the German rule. Bell then found himself up against the other Duala chiefs in the Duala War, which was fought over the killing of a Bonaberi Duala and Bell's alleged refusal to share his profits with the other sub-lineages. Germany stopped the conflict when one of its nationals was killed. Bell survived, but his power had diminished significantly. Realising that the Duala would never again follow the rule of a single king, the Germans instead played the competitors against one another. They supported the weaker King Bell to counter the powerful King Akwa. The Germans initially ruled from Douala, which they called Kamerunstadt, but they moved their capital to the Bakweri settlement of Buea in 1901. Years of contact with Westerners and a high level of literacy had allowed a literate upper class of clerks, farmers, and traders to emerge. This class were familiar with European law and conventions, which allowed them to pressure the German colonial government with petitions, legal proceedings, and special interest groups to oppose unpopular or unfair policies. A series of these began in 1910, when the German administration initiated a new poll tax, attempted to seize lands in Douala township, and then tried to oust the native population from the town completely. King Bell's successor, King Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to rally resistance by sending emissaries to visit the leaders of island groups. Duala Manga Bell had many allies. Cameroonian kings held together. King Bell's closest ally, kindred and best friend was King Ekandjoum Joseph, whom he visited when he was persecuted by the Germans. The latter king resisted and refused until his death to cooperate with the German administration, which he did not trust. German pretended that Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum tipped the Germans off, and Bell and his collaborators were executed in 1914 for high treason. =British and French administrations= In 1918, Germany lost World War I, and her colonies became mandates of the League of Nations. France became the new steward of Duala territories. The Duala continued to prosper. Though the French had largely stripped their kings of power, almost half of the ethnic group's 15-20,000 members were important traders, plantation managers or owners, chiefs, or clerks in the civil service by the 1930s. The rest of the people were fishermen and farmers. By the 1940s, many Duala had attained prominence as builders, as well, servicing the growing cities of Douala and Victoria . alt= The new colonials maintained the German policies of ousting uncooperative rulers and of impressing workers for the plantations. Individuals could opt to pay a fine to avoid the labour, however, which led to a dearth of workers from the wealthier areas. The French thus encouraged people from the interior to move to the coast and work the plantations (settled well away from the influence of the Duala chiefs). These immigrants were primarily Bamileke. The newcomers grew numerically and economically dominant over time, leading to ethnic tensions with the indigenes. By the early 1930s, the Duala were a minority in the town named for them. On 19 December 1929, four paramount chiefs sent a petition to the League of Nations asking for independence for the Cameroons. Their largest concern, however, was the return of seized Duala lands. This Duala land problem reached a head in 1925 when the French sold lands on the Joss Plateau that the Germans had appropriated. In response to pressure from the Bell clan, the French offered other territory in compensation. The Bells initially refused, but the Great Depression eventually prompted them to accept the French compromise. The Bells gained land in Bali district, and the French promised not to take any of the Akwa or Deido clans' holdings. In the late 1930s, Alexandre Duala Manga Bell had emerged as the unofficial leader of the Duala proper. In 1937, the French expelled the Duala from Akwa town (an area of Douala), although they allowed them to maintain ownership of the land. During World War II, the French and British showed favouritism toward white-owned plantations, and many Duala-owned farms became unprofitable . Meanwhile, other Cameroonian ethnic groups had caught up to the Duala's lead in education and Westernisation. At war's end, the United Nations set in motion the decolonisation of Africa. The Duala remained important in this process. For example, many Duala supported the pro-independence Union des Populations du Cameroun party (UPC) when it first formed. Other parties that had either Duala founders or significant backing include the Bloc D√©mocratique Camerounais (BDC), and Action Nationale (AN). Geography Map showing the location of the various Duala ethnic groups of Cameroon The Duala are primarily concentrated in Cameroon's Littoral Province in the Moungo, Nkam, and Wouri divisions. Their settlements lie largely along the coast or just inland. The Wouri estuary, where the Wouri, Mungo, and Dibamba Rivers empty, forms the centre of Duala country. Douala is their traditional capital, and many Duala live in and around the city, although today it has come to reflect the diversity of Cameroon as a whole. Culture The Duala today are divided into the urban and rural. Those who live in the cities, particularly Douala itself, earn a living at a number of skilled and unskilled professions. Many Duala still own parts of the city, allowing them to live off rents and development. The rural Duala, in contrast, work as fishermen and farmers, mostly at the subsistence level. Fishing is the trade of choice. Traditional Duala society was divided into three strata. At the top were the Wonja, native Duala, with full rights of land ownership. The next tier consisted of the Wajili, either non-Duala peoples or the descendants of slaves. Finally, the Wakomi, or slaves, made up the bottom rung. Chiefs and headmen sat at the pinnacle of this hierarchy in the past, though today such figures have very little power in their own right. Instead, such individuals are more likely to own property and to have inherited wealth. Councils of elders and secret societies allow communities to decide important issues. =Language= The Duala language is a member Bantu group, closely related to other Duala languages, a dialect continuum including Malimba. Duala is part of the Niger‚ÄìCongo language family. Duala is used as a trade languages, due largely to the spread of the tongue by early missionaries. This is particularly true among the neighbouring Wovea, many of whom speak Duala in lieu of their native tongue, and the Isubu, many of whom are bilingual in Duala. In addition, individuals who have attended school or lived in an urban centre usually speak French, although English and German were more common in historical periods. The rate of literacy is relatively high among the Duala, though this is for reading and writing European languages. At least until the German period, Duala men used a kind of \\"drum language\\", tapping out coded messages to communicate news over long distances. =Marriage and kinship patterns= Duala inheritance is patrilineal; upon the father's death, his property is split among his male heirs. The Duala have traditionally practiced polygamy, although with the introduction of Christianity, this custom has become rarer. =Religion= The Duala have been mostly Christianized since the 1930s. Evangelical denominations dominate, particularly the Baptist church. Nevertheless, remnants of a pre-Christian ancestor worship persist. As might be expected for coastal peoples, the sea also plays an important role in this faith. For example, Duala belief holds that their ancestors live in the sea. In this worldview, demi-human water spirits known as Miengu (singular: Jengu) live in the waters and mediate between worshippers and God. Traditional festivals held each year serve as the most visible expression of these traditional beliefs in modern times. =Sports= Duala war canoe, 1884 Pirogue racing has traditionally been the most important sport among the Duala. The sport reached its peak during the German colonial period, when organisers held races annually on 27 January (the Kaiser's birthday). Under the French, they became semiannual, occurring on 14 July (Bastille Day) and 11 November (Armistice Day). A typical Duala racing pirogue is 20‚Äì28 metres long with no keel and a bow carved with intricate designs. A team of 40-50 canoeists, mostly men who make their livings as fishermen, mans each vessel. In the past, diviners used the results of these races to predict the future, but today a Christian priest presides instead. Up to the late 1930s, a family on Jebale Island claimed to be able to summon the Miengu water spirits to help favoured participants. Beginning in the 1930s, football has grown to eclipse other sports in popularity. Institutions Assemblies, secret societies, and other groups play an important role in keeping the Duala unified, helping them set goals, and giving them a venue to find solutions to common problems. Chief among these is the Ngondo, an assembly of important chiefs. Another of these is the muemba (plural: miemba), a grouping of all Duala of a certain age range or tribal clan. The miemba serve to let their members network and socialise. Other secret societies include the Ekongolo, Jengu, Losango, and Munji. Classification The Duala are Bantu in language and origin. More narrowly, they fall into the Sawa, or the coastal peoples of Cameroon. =Subgroups= In addition to the tribal distinctions already noted, the Duala further sort themselves into a number of lineages or clans. Among the Duala proper, these are the Bonanjo (including the Bonapriso), the Bonaku, the Bonabela, and the Bonaberi. These names represent the principal families in each clan: Njo, Priso, Akwa, Ebele-Deido, and Bell, respectively. In addition, the Duala sometimes include the Bodiman, Pongo, and Wuri among their ranks, but not as sub-lineages.

It was written by Philip and Belinda Haas with A. S. Byatt after her novella Morpho Eugenia (included in her book Angels and Insects). The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design. Plot William Adamson (Mark Rylance), a naturalist, returns to Victorian England, staying with his benefactor, Sir Harold Alabaster (Jeremy Kemp). He has lost his possessions in a shipwreck, returning from an extended expedition to the Amazon. Now dependent upon his patron, William is employed to catalog Sir Harold's specimen collection and teach his younger children the natural sciences, assisting their governess, the unassuming Matty Crompton (Kristin Scott Thomas). William becomes enamoured of Sir Harold's eldest daughter, Eugenia (Patsy Kensit). Eugenia is softly spoken, anxious, and mourning the recent death of her fianc√©. Despite his impoverishment, Eugenia proves receptive and accepts his marriage proposal. Although Sir Harold grants his approval, Eugenia's snobbish and spoilt brother, Edgar, (Douglas Henshall) dislikes William's humble origins. Soon after the marriage, Eugenia becomes pregnant. Eugenia's behaviour alternates between coldness, locking William out of her room, and intense sexual passion. The couple has four more children. She calls the one son, 'Edgar', in the family tradition, annoying William. He spends much of his time with the Alabaster children and Matty, observing an ant colony in the forest, with a view to writing a book. Returning via the stables from an excursion, William discovers his brother-in-law Edgar raping a teenage servant. Edgar tells William that she consented, but she is clearly terrified. William forms a bond with Matty, who encourages his scientific activities and displays a strong intelligence. The book is successfully published. One day, William is summoned from the hunt to the house by a servant who claims Eugenia wants him. Entering the bedroom, he finds Eugenia and Edgar engaging in incestuous sex. Eugenia confesses that this has occurred since childhood and that her fianc√© committed suicide in consequence. She says that when it started she was too young to understand but, after she saw herself through the eyes of her fianc√©, she felt guilty. In tears, Eugenia explains that she tried to stop, but that Edgar's will was too strong. William realises that he has been used to conceal the incest and that the children (who bear no resemblance to him) are Edgar's. Matty reveals her knowledge of the affair to William during a Scrabble-like game. Later, she explains that the servants were also aware and arranged for him to find out. Expressing frustration at her life and dependency on the Alabasters, Matty reveals that she has published her own book on the insects and has bought tickets for a ship for the Amazon. William is reluctant; despite his attraction, he feels that the rain forest is unsuitable for a woman. After she assures him of her strength and love for him, William acquiesces. Before leaving, William meets Eugenia and tells her he intends never to return. He also promises to keep her secret, for fear of injuring her ailing father, and hopes she may find a way to live with her guilt. The movie ends with William and Matty departing in a coach for Liverpool, eager to begin their new adventure and leave the past behind.

The costumes worn by Kensit and the other actresses were designed in bright colors and bold patterns to evoke the appearance of insects, which would earn the film an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design. In the marriage proposal scene, Patsy Kensit's gown was treated with female sex hormones to attract the moths to her. 6,000 ants were brought in initially for the forest colony scenes, but they walked off before filming. Another 6,000 were brought in as a replacement, only for the original 6,000 to return. Release and reception The film was entered into competition at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1995 and screened at the London Film Festival on 5 November. It received a limited release in the US on 26 January 1996. Critical reception was very strong, with the performances and production values being particularly praised. Janet Maslin claimed the film had \\"...formidable intensity and haunting beauty\\" and Roger Ebert awarded it 3.5 Stars. Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle thought that Haas directed the film \\"...with elegance and control, and seasons the sexier, more melodramatic elements of his tale with subtle, slightly mocking irony.\\" Time Out concluded that Angels and Insects \\"...is not your average period drama...the costumes, design, music and camerawork steer clear of naturalism, highlighting both the modernity of the approach and the notions of humans as creatures to be observed dispassionately.

The name is derived from Henry Ford's estate, Fair Lane, near Dearborn, Michigan. Over time, the name referred to a number of different cars in different classes; the Fairlane was initially a full-sized car, but became a mid-sized car from the 1962 model year. The mid-sized model spawned the Australian-built Fairlane in 1967, although in that market it was considered a large car. First generation (1955‚Äì1956) For the 1955 model year the Fairlane name replaced the Crestline as Ford's premier full-sized offering. Six different body styles were offered, including the Crown Victoria Skyliner with a tinted, transparent plastic roof, the regular Crown Victoria coupe with much stainless steel trim, a convertible Sunliner, the Victoria hardtop coupe, and traditional sedans. All featured the trademark stainless- steel \\"Fairlane stripe\\" on the side. Power options were a straight-6 engine and a V8. The Y-block was offered as an option and was called the Thunderbird V-8. Few changes were made for 1956; a four-door Victoria hardtop and two new, more powerful V8 options, of and , the latter available up to , were introduced. The Lifeguard safety package was introduced. The two-door Victoria hardtop featured a new and slimmer roofline. A one-year only two-door station wagon, the 1956 Ford Parklane, featured Fairlane-level trim. It was marketed to compete against the Chevrolet Nomad.

The new proportions and modern styling were a hit with customers to the extent that the Ford outsold Chevrolet in 1957 for the first time since 1935. A new top trim level was reversed, the Fairlane 500. For the first time, the lower-level Custom line had a shorter wheelbase than the Fairlane. Engines were largely the same as the year before. The big news for 1957 was the introduction of the Fairlane 500 Skyliner power retractable hardtop, whose solid top hinged and folded down into the trunk space at the touch of a button. Another facelift for 1958 had fashionable quad headlights, a grille that matched the 1958 Thunderbird, and other styling changes. New big-block FE V8s of 332 and 352 CID (5.4 L and 5.8 L) replaced the previous largest V8s, and a better three-speed automatic transmission was also available. A new top-level full-sized model was introduced at mid-year 1959, the Ford Galaxie. The 1959 Galaxie displayed both \\"Fairlane 500\\" and \\"Galaxie\\" badging.

The Galaxie series continued as the top-of-the-line full-sized Ford. Fairlane 500s demoted to mid-level in the lineup and were equivalent to the Chevrolet Bel Air. Fairlanes were primarily sold as base level trim models for fleet use (taxi, police). Both were only available as pillared sedans. The big-block 390 CID V8 was available in 1961 as the top-horsepower option, as the \\"horsepower wars\\" in Detroit continued.Ford 1960 Brochure \\"1960 Fords\\".

With an overall length of 197 in (5004 mm) and a wheelbase of 115.5 in (2934 mm), it was 16 in (406 mm) longer than the Falcon and 12.3 in (312 mm) shorter than the Galaxie. Wheel track varied from 53.5 in (1355 mm) to 56 in (1422 mm) depending on model and specification. Like the Falcon, the Fairlane had a unibody frame, but the body incorporated an unusual feature Ford dubbed torque boxes, four boxed structures in the lower body structure designed to absorb road shock by moving slightly in the vertical plane. Suspension was a conventional short-long arm independent arrangement in front, with Hotchkiss drive in the rear. The Fairlane was initially offered only in two-door or four-door sedan body styles. The Fairlane's standard engine was the 170 CID (2.8 L) six, but as an option, it introduced Ford's new, lightweight Windsor V8, initially with a displacement of 221 CID (3.6 L) and 145 hp (108 kW); a 260 CID (4.2 L) \\"Challenger\\" version was added at mid-year, with an advertised . The Sports Coupe option d√©buted mid-year and featured bucket seats and a small floor console. The trim level supplemented the Fairlane and Fairlane 500 trim levels (the 500 model had more decorative trim, such as a wider chrome stripe down the side and three bullets on the rear quarter panels). The Challenger 289 CID engine was introduced in mid-1963, with solid lifters and other performance pieces helping the engine produce an advertised ; however, it was equipped with single exhaust like the less powerful engines. This engine was coded \\"K\\" in the vehicle identification number. Exterior identification was by fender-mounted \\"V\\" badges that read \\"289 High Performance\\". That same year, station wagons arrived, called the Ranch Wagon and Ranch Custom Wagon. All 1962 Fairlanes had \\"B\\" posts despite the popularity of the pillarless hardtop and convertible styles in that era. Ford saw the problem and introduced two pillarless hardtop coupes for 1963, in Fairlane 500 and Sports Coupe trim. For 1963 and later Sports Coupe models, the center console, which had come from the Falcon parts bin for 1962, was changed to be similar to that of the Galaxie. Sports Coupe models got a floor- mounted shift lever for the center console when Cruise-O-Matic or 4-speed manual transmissions were specified; however when the two-speed Fordomatic was ordered, the shift lever was installed on the steering column (and the console was the same without the shifter). Front-end styling for the 1963 models mimicked the big Galaxie models, but the rear end retained the small tailfins and \\"pieplate\\" tail lamp styling cues. The Squire wagon (a fake woodie) was available for 1963 only, including one model with front bucket seats. The \\"Swing-Away\\" steering wheel became an option in 1964. The 1964 and 1965, Fairlane ranges consisted of similar body styles: base Fairlane and Fairlane 500 two-door coupes and four-door sedans, and Fairlane 500 and Sports Coupe two-door hardtops. As in 1963, the Sports Coupe got its own standard \\"spinner\\" wheel covers and extra exterior brightwork. Large \\"Sports Coupe\\" scripts graced the \\"C\\" pillars. The Fairlane Squire wagon was dropped, but the standard station wagon was continued. The 221 V8 was dropped after 1963, leaving the six as the base engine and the 260 as the base V8. The \\"K-code\\" 271-horsepower 289 V8 continued into 1964, gaining dual exhausts, while a version of the 289 with a two-barrel carburetor and hydraulic lifters was introduced. The two-speed Fordomatic continued as the automatic transmission choice for the 260 in 1964, while 289 V8s got the three-speed Cruise-O-Matic transmission option. All 1965 models featured wheels as standard, in place of the earlier wheels, and Fordomatic was finally phased out, leaving the Cruise- O-Matic as the only automatic available for the Fairlane. The 260 was also dropped after 1964, leaving the two-barrel 289 as the base V8. Styling-wise, in 1964, a new grille and headlight bezels were introduced, the tail fins were dropped, some chrome decorating on the side was changed, and the shape of the trunk lid changed. Styling features for 1965 included body-color headlight bezels for the deluxe models and rectangular taillight lenses, a return to the 1962-1963 trunk lid, along with less chrome on the body and a small standup hood ornament. Australian and New Zealand models had longer cut-outs in the rear bumper to accommodate their license plates.

These cars were running the 289 and were set up at Dearborn Steel Tubing that built the special cars for Ford special vehicle operations . These soon evolved into the \\"Thunderbolts\\" for 1964. The racing Thunderbolt was a two-door post car, heavily modified to incorporate Ford's new 427 CID (7.0 L) V8 race engine with two four-barrel carburetors on a high-riser manifold, ram-air through the openings left by deleting the inboard headlights, equal-length headers, trunk- mounted battery, several fiberglass parts (hood, door skins, fenders, and front bumper), acrylic glass windows, and other lightweight options, including deleted rear-door window winders, carpeting, radio, sealant, sun visors, armrests, jack, lug wrench, heater, soundproofing, and passenger-side windshield wiper. The cars wore Fairlane 500 trim, and were only offered with the two-door sedan body. This special model, of which 111 to 127 total were made (sources disagree), delivered 657 hp (490 kW) at 7,500 rpmFord FE engine and was known as the Thunderbolt. Racing in NHRA Super Stock (which required only fifty cars be available to the publicBurgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Favorite Race Car Ever voting: Early Door Cars/Roadsters\\", written 11 July 2008, at NHRA.com (retrieved 27 September 2018)), on -wide tires, the Thunderbolt was based on the midlevel Fairlane 500 two-door pillared sedan, and in 1964 set elapsed time and top speed records at 11.6 seconds and 124 mph (200 km/h). took the Super Stock title (with Gas Ronda taking the honors), and won the Manufacturer's Cup. The car as delivered was slightly too light to meet NHRA's 3200-lb (1451-kg) minimum weight unless it was raced with a full tank of gasoline, which would bring it to 3203 lb (1453 kg). NHRA rules at the time required a metal front bumper, so the cars began to be supplied with an aluminum bumper and previous purchasers were supplied with one. Thunderbolt production was ended due to NHRA rule changes for Super Stock competition, requiring 500 vehicles be built to be entered in that class. Ford had been losing $1500 to $2000 on each Thunderbolt sold at the sticker price of $3900. The first 11 Thunderbolts were painted maroon (known as Vintage Burgundy in Ford literature), the rest white; 99 had manual transmissions. Many are still raced. About 50 similar Mercury Cyclones were also produced by Ford in 1964, destined to be modified to represent Ford in A/FX competition, which they dominated, as well. These vehicles varied greatly in wheel track due to customer options for varying suspension and wheel/tire combinations. Front tracks from 54 to 56 in and rear tracks from 53.5 to 55.5 in were common. Fifth generation (1966‚Äì1967) The Fairlane was revised in 1966. The appearance was changed to match the full-sized Ford, which had been restyled in the 1965 model year. The front end featured vertically stacked dual headlights. The XL, GT, and GTA packages were introduced, as well as a convertible to join the existing range of sedans, hardtops, and station wagons. The \\"K-code\\" 289 CID engine was dropped this year. The GT featured a 390 CID FE V8 as standard, while the GTA also included the newly introduced the SportShift Cruise-o-Matic automatic transmission. The GT/GTA 390 CID engine developed with higher compression, and had a four-barrel carburetor. Mid year, Ford produced 57 special Fairlane 500 two-door hardtops with \\"R-code\\" V8 engine rated at at 6000 rpm and at 3700 rpm of torque, equipped with Ford's \\"Top-Loader\\" four-speed manual transmission. Built to qualify the engine/transmission combination for NHRA and IHRA Super Stock racing, they were white and had fiberglass hoods with a forward-facing hood scoop which ended at the edge of the hood. The Fairlane Squire wagon was reintroduced for 1966. Minor trim changes were introduced for 1967 as the Fairlane was mildly facelifted. The 289 CID small-block was the base V8, with a 200 CID six standard, with the 390 CID optional (with either two- or four-barrel carburetor, at 275 and , respectively). The 427s were still available, either with a single four-barrel carburetor or dual quad carbs, developing 410 (W-code) and 425 bhp (R-code), 427s were available on XL models, but very few were built. The notable addition for the 1967 model year was a Ranchero pickup as part of the Fairlane range (from 1960 to 1965, the Ranchero was based on the Falcon, while in 1966 it used the Fairlane platform but Falcon styling). The 1967 Fairlanes also included a number of federal government-mandated safety features, including a new energy-absorbing steering column with a large padded steering wheel hub, soft interior trim, four-way hazard flashers, a dual-chamber braking system, and shoulder belt anchors. The convertible had a tempered safety glass rear window. The Falcon Ranchero and Falcon station wagon were, between 1966 and 1970, identical under the skin to the Fairlane versions of the same model. Only sheetmetal and trim differed. Two different two-door coupe models were offered. The lower-end Fairlane Club Coupe had pillars separating the door glass and rear side glass, while the higher trim level Fairlanes were pillarless two-door hardtops, similar to the convertibles.

The wheelbase remained at , but it grew in other dimensions. They were about four inches (102 mm) longer and heavier than the cars they replaced. A fastback Sportsroof model was introduced in the Fairlane 500 series, as well as a more luxurious Torino model at the top of the intermediate range, contributing 172,083 of the Fairlane's 371,787 units sold that year. In a cost-saving decision, the station wagons carried over the 1966-67 bodies from the cowl back. The Ranch Wagon model name was deleted; Fairlane wagons had either the base or the 500 trim. Base hardtop sales more than doubled, to 44,683 units.Flory, p.599. The base engine was the I6, with several optional V8s. Early production 1968 base V8 Fairlanes were equipped with the two-barrel , while later units came with the . The GTs were part of the Torino range, with the 302 CID V8 standard, with optional engines being the 390 CID V8 in two- and four-barrel versions. The 390 four-barrel was supplanted mid-year as the top performance engine by the Cobra Jet, developing . There was also a Super Cobra Jet. The Fairlane 500, Ranchero, and Torino GT/GTA were also offered with the new 351W CID with a four-barrel producing 250 HP and only in the Torino GT/GTA the 351C four-barrel with 275 HP could be ordered. The Ranchero coupe utility body style was available in standard, 500, and GT versions. The Cobra was introduced in 1969 as a competitor for Plymouth's Road Runner. Basic models featured the 302 CID V8 and three-speed manual transmission as standard. Options included the 390 CID and two V8s. The Cobras had a standard 428 CID V8 rated at , while options included bucket seats, hood scoop, clock, tachometer, power disc brakes, and 4.30:1 rear axle gearing. \\"Regular\\" Fairlanes and Rancheros continued, all with bucket-seat options.

At the start of the model year, only the Fairlane 500 remained as the base trim model in what was now effectively the Torino series. The straight six-cylinder was the economy power, while largest engine was now a with four-barrel carburetor and . Different heads were optional and gave the Cobra and higher compression. Other options included the Cobra Jet Ram Air 429, though Ford quoted the same power output, and the Drag Pack rated at . However, the 1970s were slower than the 1969s, and race teams were forced to run the older models. The Falcon name was transferred from Ford's now discontinued, in the US, compact to a basic, even lower-trim version of the intermediate platform as a \\"1970¬Ω\\" model on January 1, 1970. This series included a two-door sedan which was not available in the higher trim lines. For 1971, the Falcon and Fairlane 500 names were dropped, as all of the intermediate models took the Torino name. The Falcon and Fairlane names continued to be used in Australia through to the 21st century. The Fairlane name continued to be used in Venezuela through 1978 on corresponding Ford Torino and LTD II models.Ford 25 Aniversario published by Ford Venezuela in 1987 Ford Fairlane in Argentina The Argentine Ford Fairlane The four-door sedan of the 1968 body style was built in Argentina from 1969 to 1973 and the 1969 body style from 1973 to 1981 under the Fairlane name with three equipment packages: Standard, 500 and LTD. The car was similar to the American model except the engines. The two options were a 221 CID 6-cylinder with , and the old 292 phase I (1969‚Äì1971) CID \\"Y-block\\" V8 which had been last used in the 1964 F-Series truck; it was rated at , in 1971 the Ford Motor Company Argentina decided to make an improvement on the 292, was started by the covers mainly the problem of spark plugs was solved by giving an inclination towards the front of the engine that allowed an easier extraction in the car, changed the opening order and exhaust cam, valves larger intake (of the 292 heavy duty American) were placed, fuel lines making them more direct was improved with a new admission very similar to that of the small block 289, 302 pistons maximum compression with lomo brand Buxton were used, raising the compression at 8 to 1, allowing the engine erogue 185 HP at 4500 rpm, another improvement were leaks with individual manifold runners, eliminating the original American system of a manifold connected to another in series, used in trucks, in cars they were always individual. Distributors are different in coupling, calling FASE II . In 1978, the LTD \\"Elite\\" option was introduced as the most luxurious made in Argentina. By the end of production in 1981, almost 30,000 Fairlanes had been made. Ford Fairlane in Venezuela Ford manufactured the Torino in Venezuela marketed as the Fairlane and Fairlane 500. These cars were identical to the U.S. Torino through 1976 and both base Fairlane and upscale Fairlane 500 used the \\"base\\" Torino grille. For 1977‚Äì1979 the Fairlane was based on the American LTD II. 2005 concept The Ford Fairlane concept car at the 2005 Chicago Auto Show At the 2005 Auto Show circuit, Ford revealed a new concept car with the Fairlane nameplate.\\"2005 Chicago Auto Show: Ford Fairlane Photo Gallery.\\" Motor Trend, 2005.

Versions  Perhaps the definitive 20th century recording of the song was that of Enrico Caruso, the great Neapolitan opera singer. Mario Lanza recorded this song in this album \\"Mario Lanza sings Caruso favorites\\", RCA Victor LSC-2393. In the United States, an early edition of the song, with an English translation by Thomas Oliphant, was published by M. McCaffrey, Baltimore. In Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Norway, \\"Santa Lucia\\" has been given various lyrics to accommodate it to the winter-light Saint Lucy's Day, at the darkest time of the year. The three most famous lyrics versions in Swedish are Lucias√•ngen, also known by its incipit, Sankta Lucia, ljusklara h√§gring (\\"Saint Lucy, bright illusion\\"); Natten g√•r tunga fj√§t (\\"The night walks with heavy steps\\"); and the 1970s \\"kindergarten\\" version, Ute √§r m√∂rkt och kallt (\\"Outside it‚Äôs dark and cold\\"). The more common Norwegian version is Svart senker natten seg (\\"Black the night descends\\"). In the Czech Republic (or former Czechoslovakia), it was made famous with the words Kr√°sn√° je Neapol sung by Waldemar Matu≈°ka. In Austria it is famous under the title \\"Wenn sich der Abend mild\\". It is sung by Austrian fraternities. In Thailand a translation, Silpakorn Niyom (), is the anthem of Silpakorn University; the founder of the university, Silpa Bhirasri, was Italian. Performances * Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). * Elvis Presley recorded the song on the 1965 album Elvis for Everyone! It was featured in his film Viva Las Vegas. *Italian tenor Sergio Franchi (1926‚Äì1990) recorded this song in 1963 on his RCA Victor Red Seal album, Our Man From Italy. *Hayley Westenra included the song in her album Treasure. * In 1964, Jim Nabors, Don Knotts, Andy Griffith, and the choir performed the song on The Andy Griffith Show, in the episode \\"The Song Festers\\". * Italian-American crooner Jerry Vale recorded a popular version of the song. * Mustafa_Saƒüya≈üar recorded a version in Turkish in 1998, with his son Cemil.

It saw the return of guitarist, Russ Cogdell, and the addition of bassist Shawn Koschik and drummer Stephen Peck after the departure of Jesse Smith. A music video was made for the song \\"The Rising End (The First Prophecy)\\". Title note Originally the album was going to be called, Live... from the Funeral of God, but the band's management was concerned that fans might construe that to mean it's a live recording, so the title was shortened. Concept The album is a concept album, narrating an apocalyptic story in which God, fed up with the path chosen by humanity, decides to disappear, leaving humanity to its fate. Subsequently, the world falls into a state of war and self-destruction. However, man soon reverts to a state in which he waits for God to return. Sound Sounding different from most albums Zao have released, this record is a swing towards bands such as Killswitch Engage and Shadows Fall.

Along with the other coastal peoples, they belong to the Sawa ethnic groups. The Mungo have historically been dominated by the Duala people, and the two groups share similar cultures, histories, and claims of origin. History and geography The Mungo share no singular origin story. Some claim the same history as the Duala and Limba, descending from a man named Mbedi. From a place called Piti (northeast of Douala), Mbedi's sons Ewale and Dibongo migrated south toward the Cameroon coast. while others trace their ancestry to a man named Lokula who migrated east from near Efik territory in modern-day Nigeria. The former tradition seems more likely, however, and the Nigerian story possibly indicates that later settlers entered Limba country from Efik territories at some point and assimilated.Fanso 51. By the 16th century, the Duala had become the leading traders in Cameroon. The Mungo provided goods and slaves to the Duala in exchange for goods obtained from the Europeans, such as alcohol, gunpowder, guns, mirrors, shoes, textiles, and tools. In 1918, Germany lost World War I, and her colonies became mandates of the League of Nations. Great Britain and France split the administration of the Kameruns, partitioning the Cameroonian Littoral. The Mungo were divided in two. Map showing the location of the various Duala ethnic groups of Cameroon The Mungo live along the Mungo River's lower stretch and the creeks that feed it. Their territory straddles the border of the Moungo division of the Littoral Province and the Fako division of the Southwest Province. Fishing is the primary means of subsistence. =Language= The Mungo who speak a dialect of Duala.\\"Duala\\", Ethnologue. Duala is part of the Bantu group of the Niger‚ÄìCongo language family. In addition, individuals who have attended school or lived in an urban centre usually speak a European language. For Littoral Mungo, this is French; for Southwest Mungo, it is Cameroonian Pidgin English or standard English; and for the Mungo it is one or the other. A growing number of the Anglophones today grow up with Pidgin as their first tongue.\\"Pidgin, Cameroon\\", Ethnologue. =Arts= The Mungo are regular attendees of the annual Ngondo, a traditional festival of the Sawa peoples. The goal is to communicate with the ancestors and ask them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, beauty pageants, pirogue races, and traditional wrestling.Guide touristique 126. Classification The Mungo are Bantu in language and origin.

Along with other coastal peoples, they belong to Cameroon's Sawa ethnic groups. They were one of the earliest Cameroonian peoples to make contact with Europeans, and over two centuries, they became influential traders and middlemen. Under the kings William I of Bimbia and Young King William, the Isubu formed a state called Bimbia. History=Early population movements= The predominant Isubu oral history holds that the ethnic group hails from Mboko, the area southwest of Mount Cameroon.Fanso 50-1. Tradition makes them the descendants of Isuwu na Monanga, who led their migration to the west bank of the Wouri estuary. When a descendant of Isuwu named Mbimbi became king, the people began to refer to their territories as Bimbia.Fanso 51. =Kingdom of Bimbia= Portuguese traders reached the Wouri estuary in 1472. Over the next few decades, more Europeans came to explore the estuary and the rivers that feed it, and to establish trading posts. The Isubu carved out a role for themselves as middlemen, trading ivory, kola nuts, and peppers from the interior. However, a major commodity was slaves, most bound for plantations on nearby islands such as Annobon, Fernando Po, Pr√≠ncipe, and S√£o Tom√©.Fanso 68. By the 16th century, the Isubu were second only to the Duala in trade. The earliest Isubu merchants were likely chiefs or headmen.Fanso 73. Bimbia, the primary Isubu settlement, grew quickly. Europeans traders did their best to support friendly chiefs against their rivals, adulating them with titles such as King, Prince, or Chief. In exchange, these indigenes offered trade monopolies to their patrons and sometimes ceded land. An Isubu chief named Bile became leader of the Isubu as King William, although Dick Merchant of Dikolo village and other chiefs eventually opposed his dominance. British traders became the dominant European presence in the region by the mid-19th century, and the Crown used them to enforce abolition of the slave trade in the Gulf of Guinea. In 1844 and 1848, King William signed anti-slavery treaties. In exchange, the traders provided him with annual gifts of alcohol, guns, textiles, and other goods. William was also asked to forbid practices the British viewed as barbaric, such as sacrificing a chief's wife upon his death.Austen and Derrick 66. With William's blessing, Bimbia became a haven for repatriated slaves and escapees from the illicit trade, which continued for many more years. The British also endeavored to educate and Christianise the Bimbians.Austen and Derrick 67. King William rebuffed the earliest missionaries because he did not agree with their insistence on prayer and opposition to polygamy. In 1844, however, Joseph Merrick convinced William to let him open a church and school in Bimbia.Fanso 102. In 1858, the Spanish ousted Protestant missionaries from their base at Fernando Po. King William sold a portion of his domains to the missionary Alfred Saker, who then founded Victoria (today known as Limbe). By 1875, numerous missions and schools sprung up in Victoria and other settlements. Victoria came to be a mixture of freed slaves, working Cameroonians, and Christianised Cameroonians from the various coastal groups. Cameroonian Pidgin English began to develop at this time. Isubu society was changed fundamentally by the European trade. European goods became status symbols, and some rulers appointed Western traders and missionaries as advisors. Large numbers of Isubu grew wealthy, leading to rising class tensions. Competition escalated between coastal groups and even between related settlements. Between 1855 and 1879, the Isubu alone engaged in at least four conflicts, both internal and with rival ethnic groups. Traders exploited this atmosphere, and beginning in 1860, German, French, and Spanish merchants had established contacts and weakened the British monopoly. The Duala had gained a virtual hegemony over trade through the Wouri estuary, and the Isubu had little power left. Young King William was virtually powerless when he succeeded his father in 1878.Elango 55. =German administration= In July 1884, the Isubu found themselves part of the German Empire after annexation by Gustav Nachtigal. Coastal territory became the heart of the new colony, but Bimbia and the Isubu lands had already passed their prime. German arrival on the mainland meant that the coastal peoples' monopoly on trade had ended. Most Isubu turned to subsistence farming or fishing to survive. However, years of contact with Westerners and a high level of literacy had allowed a literate upper class of Isubu clerks, farmers, and traders to emerge in Victoria and Buea. This class were familiar with European law and conventions, which allowed them to pressure the German colonial government with petitions, legal proceedings, and special interest groups to oppose unpopular or unfair policies.Derrick 107. =British administration= In 1918, Germany lost World War I, and her colonies became mandates of the League of Nations. The British became the new colonial rulers of Isubu lands. Great Britain integrated its portion of Cameroon with the neighbouring colony of Nigeria, setting the new province's capital at Buea. The British practiced a policy of indirect rule, entrusting greater powers to Bakweri and Isubu chiefs in Buea and Victoria. Chief Manga Williams of Victoria became one of two representatives to the Nigerian Eastern House of Assembly. He was succeeded by another Isubu, John Manga Williams. Geography Map showing the location of the various Duala ethnic groups of Cameroon The Isubu are primarily concentrated in the Fako division of Cameroon's Southwest Province. Their settlements lie largely along the coast or just inland, east of Limbe and west of Douala. They occupy the coast directly east of the Wovea, with their main settlement at Bimbia. The town of Limbe is a mixture of Isubu and other ethnic groups. Culture The Isubu today are divided into the urban and rural. Those who live in the cities earn a living at a number of skilled and unskilled professions. The rural Isubu work as fishermen and farmers, mostly at the subsistence level. =Language= Isu is the Isubu language. In addition, many Isubu speak Duala or Mokpwe, the languages of the Duala and Bakweri respectively. Isu is part of the Bantu group of the Niger‚ÄìCongo language family.\\"Isu\\", Ethnologue. In addition, individuals who have attended school or lived in an urban centre usually speak a European language. For some Isubu, this is French; for others, it is Cameroonian Pidgin English or standard English. A growing number of the Anglophones today grow up with Pidgin as their first tongue.\\"Pidgin, Cameroon\\", Ethnologue. =Religion= The Isubu have been mostly Christianized since the 1930s. Evangelical denominations dominate, particularly the Baptist church. Nevertheless, remnants of a pre-Christian ancestor worship persist. Isubu belief states that the ancestors live in a parallel world and act as mediators between the living and God (\\"Jengu\\"). =Arts= The Isubu participate in the annual Ngondo, a traditional festival of the Duala, although today all of Cameroon's coastal peoples are invited. The main focus is on communicating with the ancestors and asking them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, beauty pageants, pirogue races, and traditional wrestling.Guide touristique 126. Classification The Isubu are Bantu in language and origin.

A stutterer from an early age, Glenn was notable for raising awareness of stuttering among children and adults as well as other disabilities.  Early life and education  Anna Margaret Castor was born on February 17, 1920, in Columbus, Ohio, to Homer and Margaret (Alley) Castor. Her father was a dentist. In 1923, the Castor family moved to New Concord, Ohio. Castor met John Glenn at a very young age when her parents became involved in the same community organizations as Glenn's parents. The families developed a friendship which allowed Castor and Glenn to remain close as they grew up. The pair became high school sweethearts and continued dating through college. Castor attended Muskingum College where she majored in music with a minor in secretarial skills and physical education. Castor was an active member of the swim team, volleyball team, and tennis team. She graduated in 1942. Even though she received an offer for a pipe organ scholarship from the Juilliard School, Castor declined the offer, choosing instead to stay in Ohio with Glenn. Castor and Glenn were married on April 6, 1943. They had two children, David, born in 1945, and Lyn, born in 1947. During the early years of her marriage to John Glenn, Annie Glenn worked as an organist in various churches and taught trombone lessons. Later life=Influence during the Space Race= Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam. 1965 Throughout the middle of the twentieth century, the Cold War tensions between the United States of America and the Soviet Union heightened. In an effort to boost American citizens' confidence in their government, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower decided to become involved in the Space Race and launch Project Mercury. Seven young men were chosen for this space mission. These all- American astronauts were regarded as wholesome heroes and their wives were the picture of domestic patriotism. Annie Glenn was one of the wives of the Mercury 7 astronauts. These women \\"rocketed to fame\\" to become celebrities. In her book The Astronaut Wives Club (which later became a television miniseries), Lily Koppel relates that Glenn and the other six wives formed a tight-knit support group informally called the \\"Astronaut Wives Club,\\" which she cites as influential in shaping American identity, as Americans found their values of family, patriotism, and consumerism embodied in Glenn. Koppel states that American women turned to Glenn, who had been elevated in the media because of her all-American family, as a role model on how to maintain a happy home, and also an indirect propagator of the American value of consumption. The appearance of the Astronaut Wives in the media was marketed to average American housewives. For example, when the wives wore a shade of \\"responsible pink\\" lipstick to a Life photoshoot, the published photographs were retouched to show the wives wearing \\"patriotic red\\" lipstick instead. The lip color was changed to represent a new, vibrant period in American history. After the magazine was published, red lipstick became a fad. Similarly, while Mercury 7 astronauts were given sporty Corvettes to drive, the wives were strongly encouraged to keep their family-friendly station wagons, which meant that the average American housewives who were following the Astronaut Wives' example also bought station wagons. As a result of Glenn and the other members of the Astronaut Wives Club, women across the U.S. were inspired to be brave and of course, to buy the same consumer goods Glenn and the other wives had in their homes. =Speech impairment= Glenn meeting President Barack Obama in 2012 Like her father, Annie Glenn experienced a speech stutter throughout her life. As a child, Glenn did not feel hindered by her stutter; she happily participated in activities such as softball, girl scouts, school dances, and choir. It was not until sixth grade that she first realized her speech impairment. It was determined that her stutter was present in eighty-five percent of her verbal utterances. Despite her difficulty speaking, she was able to create and maintain close relationships. After graduating college, Glenn wanted to get a job in a different town but because of her disability, her parents were worried about her living independently. However, Glenn found ways to effectively communicate without speaking out loud. For example, before shopping, she would write down exactly what she was looking for and then show the note to the sales clerk when she needed help. At the age of 53, Glenn discovered and attended a three-week treatment course at Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, to help with her dysfluency. After attending the treatment course, her speech was greatly improved; however, she did not consider herself \\"cured\\" of stuttering. Glenn was finally able to confidently vocally interact with others. When her husband began campaigning for the Senate, she was able to support him by giving speeches at public events and at rallies. Glenn used her newfound voice to bring attention to the disabled who she knew had been overlooked so often. Later, Glenn became an adjunct professor with Ohio State's Speech Pathology Department. Awards and honors The Glenns in 2012 In 1983, Glenn received the first national award of the American Speech and Hearing Association for her meritorious service to those with communicative disorders. In 1987, the National Association for Hearing and Speech Action awarded the first annual Annie Glenn Award for achieving distinction despite a communication disorder. Glenn presented the award to James Earl Jones as its first recipient. She was inducted into the National Stuttering Association Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2015, The Ohio State University renamed 17th Avenue (on its campus) to Annie and John Glenn Avenue. In 2009, the Ohio State University awarded her an honorary Doctorate of Public Service to recognize her work on behalf of children and others. The department awards the \\"Annie Glenn Leadership Award\\" annually to a person that has displayed innovative and inspirational work in speech/language pathology. =Activities and involvements= Organizations in which she was involved include: * Delta Gamma Theta Sorority (Muskingum College) * The Ohio Board of Child Abuse * The Board of Columbus (Ohio) Speech and Hearing Center * The Society of Sponsors * The Board of Trustees of Muskingum College * The Advisory Panel of the Central Ohio Speech and Hearing Association * The Advisory Board for the National Center for Survivors of Childhood Abuse * The Board for the National First Ladies' Library * The National Deafness and other Communication Disorders Advisory Council of the National Institutes of Health Personal life and death At the time of her husband's death in December 2016, Annie and John Glenn had been married for 73 years and eight months. During the course of their marriage, the couple had two children‚ÄîJohn David, born in 1945, and Carolyn Ann, born in 1947‚Äîand two grandchildren. Glenn turned 100 in February 2020.Annie Glenn turns 100: Learn more about the widow of astronaut and Senator John Glenn Three months later, on May 19, 2020, she died at a nursing home in Saint Paul, Minnesota, from complications of COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota. Portrayals in popular culture Glenn was played by Mary Jo Deschanel in the 1983 film The Right Stuff. The film highlighted her stutter, particularly in a scene involving U.S. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. In a 2015 interview, she and John Glenn indicated that, although they liked the Tom Wolfe book, they did not care for the movie adaptation of The Right Stuff.

The north‚Äìsouth signed route is a spur freeway which mainly passes through government-owned properties. For some of its path, SR 844 passes through Wright State University. The highway was first signed in 1995 on the same alignment as today. SR 844 replaced the SR 444A designation of the highway, which dated back to 1989. Route description SR 844 begins at a partial interchange with Interstate 675 (I-675). The route heads northeast as a four-lane controlled-access highway, passing under North Fairfield Road. The road has a partial interchange with Colonel Glenn Highway, before passing on the southeast and east sides of Wright State University. The highway curves due north, having an interchange with University Boulevard. After the interchange with University Boulevard, the road curves northwest, passing over SR 444\\\\. Followed by an interchange with SR 444, SR 844 ends at Gate 15A of Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. SR 844 is signed as \\"McClernon Memorial Skyway\\", after the late Brigadier General Glen J. McClernon. McClernon had been base commander during the time the university was being established‚Äîpartially on land deeded to it by the Air Force base‚Äîand also had been a two-term mayor of Fairborn. The entire length of SR 844 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes important to the nation's economy, mobility and defense. The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). History SR 844 was originally SR 444A, which opened by 1989. After a public comment period in 1994, ODOT changed the number to \\"844\\" by 1995.

Only 10 aircraft were constructed, all of which entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), who operated it under the designation Short Belfast C.1. Upon its entry into service, the Belfast held the distinction of becoming the largest aircraft that the British military had ever operated up to that time. It was also notable for being the first aircraft to be designed from the onset to be equipped with full 'blind landing' automatic landing system equipment.Flight 9 January 1964, p. 41. Following the formation of RAF Strike Command and a reorganisation of transport assets, the RAF decided to retire all of its Belfast transports by the end of 1976. Shortly after the type had been retired by the RAF, five Belfasts were sold and placed into civilian service with the cargo airline TAC HeavyLift. These civilian aircraft were used for the charter transport of various goods, including to the RAF. One Belfast is on display at the RAF Museum Cosford. A Belfast formerly operated by Heavylift Cargo is lying abandoned at Cairns Airport in Australia and is the subject of a legal dispute for fees between the airport and the current owner of the aircraft, Flying Tigers. Development=Origins= The Belfast has its origins in studies conducted by aircraft manufacturer Short Brothers into the possibility for matching an arrangement of four Bristol Orion turboprop engines with an airframe that had been optimised for the purpose of transporting various military stores during the mid 1950s.Flight 19 September 1963, p. 499. It was decided to continue these studies as part of the firm's management believed that it was highly likely that there would likely be an Operational Requirement issued for the Royal Air Force (RAF) seeking such an aircraft in the near future, although Sir Matthew Slattery, chairman of Shorts, expressed his doubt of the practicality of such an aircraft. Slattery believed that developing such an aircraft from scratch would lack sufficient market prospects and instead encouraged the use of as many components and systems from the existing Bristol Britannia transport aircraft as would be reasonably possible, a measure that was seen as logical and practical, acting to reduce development time and cost while improving reliability, with the downside of lesser performance. In March 1957, Shorts submitted its first brochure on their proposed transport aircraft, designated as the PD.18 and given the name Britannic to reflect its Britannia ancestry. The PD.18 only differed from the Britannia in terms of its fuselage and high- mounting of its wings; the wings themselves, along with the tail unit, engines, and major portions of the landing gear and various other systems were common to both types. The new circular cross-section fuselage was very large for the era, capable of accommodating a 12 ft-square load for the carriage of bulky loads such as radar units and the Blue Streak medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM); it also allows for troops to be carried across two separate decks. During 1957, it became clear that there was a definite need within the RAF for a heavy freighter. Accordingly, the issuing of Operational Requirement ASR.371 soon occurred, which sought the procurement freighter capable of carrying a wide range of military payloads over long ranges. The envisioned aircraft was to be operated by Transport Command of the RAF. The military loads envisaged included artillery, more than 200 troops, helicopters, and guided missiles. In particular, the RAF issued an increased payload/range demand of 30,000 lb being carried over a distance of 3,600 n.m, greater than the Service had originally been considering. To meet with the stated requirements, Shorts proceeded to develop their original proposal for the Britannic, which was basically stretched into the Britannic III A. As the design of the proposed aircraft was repeatedly revised, it was progressively becoming less and less common to the earlier Britannia, incorporating a greater proportion of all-new components, sections, and systems instead. Amongst the changes made were a new centre section to the wing which added around 16 ft 6in to the span and the adoption of the Rolls-Royce Tyne engine. In January 1959, the Ministry announced its selection of Short's design to meet the requirement. Accordingly, in February 1959, work on the Short's project formally commenced, known by the internal designation SC.5/10. On 21 December 1960, a contract for a total of 10 freighters, designated as the Belfast C.1, was signed. On 5 January 1964, the prototype Belfast conducted its maiden flight from Sydenham Airport, Belfast; it flew for 55-minutes by chief test pilot Denis Taylor alongside a crew of six people.Flight International, Vol. 85, No. 2862, 16 January 1964, p. 97. Following the first flight, Taylor stated that \\"It was the easiest ride I have had for a very long time... The aircraft was an absolute joy to fly. She's a beauty.\\" The first two aircraft produced were equipped with dedicated flight-test instrumentation and were used to complete development trials, which totalled roughly 850 flight hours; certification was conducted to both RAF and Air Registration Board (ARB) requirements.Flight 9 January 1964, p. 40. The first autolanding was performed after only 120 hours' test flying, less than originally estimated. On 5 October 1964, the first of the three flying Belfasts departed Northern Ireland for Torrej√≥n de Ardoz, the Community of Madrid, Spain, to participate in two weeks of performance trials; this was the first flight abroad performed by the type.\\"Belfast in Spain.\\" Flight International, 8 October l964. p. 616. According to Shorts Brothers Chairman, C. E Wrangham, the Belfast had a forecast break-even point of 30 aircraft. Despite the order for only ten aircraft, the decision had been made to assemble the aircraft using production jigs.Wood 1975, p. 225. =Proposed derivatives= Multiple derivatives of the Belfast were proposed by Short. Two principal civil versions of the aircraft, designated as SC5/10A and SH5/31, were mooted during the early 1960s. The SC5/10A was to have been a commercial freight derived directly from the Belfast C.1, retaining much of its design such as its large rear loading doors for access to the main freight hold. The payload was to be increased to 85,000 lb; reportedly, up to 150 passengers could be seated on a single deck while up to 288 people could be seated across a double-deck configuration.\\"SC.5 Belfast.\\" Flight International, 26 November 1964, p. 935. The second civil variant to be offered, the SC5/31, was to have featured a swinging nose arrangement for loading purposes in place of the rear door layout used upon the RAF model of the aircraft. It was claimed that both the payload and maximum takeoff weight would be considerably elevated above its predecessor. One proposed configuration for the SC5/31 was as a transatlantic airliner, carrying a maximum of 138 passengers on the top deck and up to 55,000 lb of palletised cargo on the lower deck; it was projected that it would be capable of flying a payload of 100,000 lb on the London-New York City route. During 1964, Short revealed that it had approached British European Airways (BEA) with its proposal for a large double-deck short-haul passenger version of the Belfast.\\"288-seater.\\" Flight International, 26 November 1964, p. 937. Additional military versions of the Belfast were proposed. The SC5/35 model was intended to be a strategic freighter capable of conducting very long range missions, while the SC5/15 was an envisioned tactical transport configuration, the latter of which was claimed to have required very little modification from the existing aircraft. A more advanced tactical airlifter, designated as SC5/21, was formulated to conform with the requirements of Operational Requirement OR.351, which was to have STOL (Short Takeoff/Landing) capabilities. It was intended to harness a boundary layer control system, to have been powered by a removable pack of three Rolls-Royce Limited turbocompressors installed in a hump above the fuselage, which would have discharged high pressure air over the flaps and control surfaces of the tail and wings.\\"Belfast Future.\\" Flight International, 9 August 1962. p. 182. Perhaps one of the most extensive proposed modifications of the basic Belfast design, designated as SC.5/40, was to be done in partnership with the American aerospace firm Lockheed Corporation.Flight 19 September 1963, p. 508. On this variant, the fuselage of the Belfast would have been paired with the wing of the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, which would have readily enabled the adoption of turbojet engines in place of the turboprops. Speculated engines to power this variant included the Pratt & Whitney JT3D-3 (18,0001b) or JT3D-8 (21,0001b), Rolls-Royce Conway 550 (21,8251b) or Bristol Siddeley BS.100 (27,0001b approximately).Wood 1975, p. 227. A broadly similar but improved proposal, designated as SC.5/45, was heavily promoted by Shorts for Operational Requirement ASR.364, partly on the basis that it would also enable a near-identical civil-orientated model to be produced for home and export use, designated as SC.5/41.Wood 1975, p. 231. Detailed presentations on the SC.5/41 and SC.5/45 proposals were made to British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and RAF respectively, but no military order was forthcoming.Wood 1975, pp. 231‚Äì232. Design Belfast C.1 XR371 Enceladus preserved at RAF Museum Cosford The Short Belfast was a large heavy-lift strategic transport aircraft.Williams, Brian. \\"The Belfast System.\\" Flight International, 9 March 1967. p. 370. It featured a high-mounted wing, which carried a total of four Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engines. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the design of the assemblies of the surfaces of both the tail and wing of the Belfast had been derived from the Bristol Britannia. One of the major changes to the wing was its conversion to a wet wing, which was performed by Canadair. There are few other common elements between the Belfast and the Britannia, although there had been a much greater proportion intended during initial designs for the aircraft.Flight 19 September 1963, pp. 499‚Äì500. The fuselage of the Belfast was a relatively conservatively-stressed cylinder of a conventional design.Flight 19 September 1963, p. 500. It was developed with a target safe-life of 15,000 pressure cycles, which was fatigued tested using a complete fuselage immersed in a water tank. Fail-safe principles were used in the design of the large side door, rear ramp and door. Rolled Z-sections were used throughout the majority of the fuselage frames and stringers, while box beams are used where the exertion of heavier-than-average loads had been typically anticipated; the structure lacks any use of forgings or machined members. The flying controls of the Belfast incorporated numerous features developed by Bristol and Canadair, in addition to Shorts; all three companies had heavily collaborated on its development. It used the same manual servo-tab system as used on the Britannia, but had some advancements, especially in terms of lateral control via a simpler spoiler configuration. Other advancements include the linking of the port aileron to the rudder to counteract adverse rolling due to rudder deflection, and the elevator is linked to the flaps to cancel out trim changes caused by flap operations. The Belfast was equipped with a full automatic landing system, produced by Smiths Aerospace, the first aircraft in the world to be designed to feature such capability from the onset of development. The autopilot and flight control system, known as the ASR 518, was triplex in the roll and pitch channels, with duplex or emergency simplex ability. The instrument landing system comprised many functions, such as an autothrottle, a head-up display, and radio altimeter. The cargo deck, in a circular-section pressurized fuselage over (roomy enough for two single-deck buses), was reached through a \\"beaver tail\\" with rear loading doors and integral ramp. It was large enough that forklift trucks could work within the cargo hold. The main undercarriage was two 8-wheel bogies and a 2-wheel nose. The Belfast was capable of a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of over 220,500 lb (100 tonnes) ‚Äì less than the contemporaneous 250-tonne Antonov An-22 and the 128-tonne Douglas C-133 Cargomaster, but more than the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. It could carry 150 troops with full equipment or various vehicles, such as a single Chieftain tank, or up to three Alvis Saladin armoured cars, or a pair of Westland Wessex helicopters, or up to four Westland Whirlwind helicopters, or up to six Westland Wasp or Westland Scout helicopters, or a pair of Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM)s. Operational history=RAF service= Belfast C.1 XR364 \\"Pallas\\" in service with No. 53 Squadron RAF Transport Command Short Belfast of Transmeridian Air Cargo at Stansted in 1979 On 20 January 1966, the Belfast C.1 entered service with No. 53 Squadron on when XR367 (the sixth production aircraft) was delivered to RAF Brize Norton, Carterton, Oxfordshire. Four months later, No. 53 Squadron was relocated to RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, to make way for upgrades being performed at Brize Norton; they returned to RAF Brize Norton in 1967. Following the type's entry into RAF service, it became apparent that a major drag problem was preventing the initial five aircraft from attaining Short's desired performance. Modifications and testing were subsequently carried out, particularly on aircraft SH1818 (which was at the time perfecting the RAF's requirement for CAT 3 automated landings at RAE Bedford), and a new rear fairing was developed, which had the result of raising the fleet's cruising speed by 40 mph. The Belfast is quite a large aircraft, as can be seen in this photo when it is compared to the vehicles and personnel near it. The reorganisation of the new RAF Strike Command was to have repercussions on the RAF's Belfast fleet and ushered in the retirement of a number of aircraft types, including the Bristol Britannia and De Havilland Comet in 1975. By the end of 1976, the Belfast fleet had been retired and flown to RAF Kemble, Gloucestershire for long-term storage. =Civilian operations= TAC HeavyLift purchased five Belfasts for commercial use in 1977 and operated three of them from 1980 after being reworked to receive commercial certification. Ironically, some of them were later chartered during the Falklands war, with some sources suggesting that this cost more than keeping all the aircraft in RAF service until the 1990s.Hewson 2001 HeavyLift's Belfasts were again contracted to support the RAF during the first Gulf War, transporting vehicles and helicopters too large to be carried by the Hercules fleet. After being retired from TAC HeavyLift service, several were parked at Southend Airport for a number of years. One aircraft was refurbished and flown to Australia in 2003, operated by HeavyLift Cargo Airlines. This aircraft is no longer flying; it was often visible parked on the General Aviation side of Cairns International Airport in Queensland, in company with one or two of the company's Boeing 727s. Now registered RP-C8020, it was moved to the general aviation (western) side of the Cairns airport on 19 August 2011, after spending the best part of a year sitting on the Cairns International apron where it had been moved prior to the scrapping of the remaining company Boeing 727 (RP-C8016) at the end of September 2010. The HeavyLift titles were painted over on 28 August 2011, but the registration RP-C8020 was still visible. The aircraft was photographed intact, but with no registration visible, at Cairns Airport on 7 August 2017. The plane continues to be on the same spot as of 17 March 2020. A second Belfast, G-BEPS (SH1822), was to have joined her in Australia following refurbishment at Southend Airport,Wastnage, Justin. \\"17,000km ferry flight and return to revenue service this year.\\" Flight International, 3 January 2007. but was instead scrapped in October 2008.Burton, Keith. \\"Belfast SC-5.\\" jetphotos.net.

Provinces are demarcated by bold lines and their sees (Metropolitan archdioceses) written in bold letters. Pope John Paul II completely redrew the map of French ecclesiastical provinces in December 2002, in order to coincide more closely with the map of French administrative regions, but losing in several instances remaining boundaries surviving from late Roman times. This meant the creation of a few new Metropolitan archbishoprics and ecclesiastical provinces. This also entailed, for several archbishoprics, the loss of their metropolitan status (symbolised by the wearing of the pallium): their bishops nevertheless retained the title of archbishop. As a result of history, many former episcopal sees were united, mainly as a consequence of the French Revolution; hence many dioceses bear the names of several cities, in which case, only the first one is the cathedral see where the bishop still actually resides. In France, most dioceses coincide with a department (administrative province), but there are a few exceptions, where some arrondissements are attached to a diocese outside the department, or form a separate diocese within the department (this happens mainly in departments with numerous populations, such as Nord or Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne).

It is also the title of their second album. The group formed in 1998. It is perhaps most well known for the song \\"Llano Estacado\\" that was featured on a series of Dodge commercials. Cooder Graw is somewhat of an anomaly in the music industry, in that its members' ages at its inception ranged from late-30s to early-50s. The band's singer, Matt Martindale, was the assistant district attorney of Gray County, Texas prior to devoting his full attention to the band. Guitarist Kelly Turner was the manager of a manufacturing plant in Slaton, Texas. The band was originally called \\"Coup de Gr√¢ce,\\" but another band was already using that name, so the name was changed to a \\"Texas-version\\" of the original name. The band's debut album, Home at the Golden Light, consisted of mostly covers and was self-produced by the band (though executive producer credit is given to Matthew McConaughey, a fraternity brother of Matt Martindale). It was released in 1998. The band's first national release, Cooder Graw was released in late 1999. Cooder Graw has toured extensively throughout Texas and the United States, both headlining and opening for artists such as Willie Nelson and Alabama. The group also played at the premiere of the film EDtv, which starred McConaughey. In 2006, Cooder Graw announced that they would cease performing together after the end of the year. Their last show was on December 31, 2006, in Fort Worth, Texas. Lead singer Matt Martindale is still performing occasionally with his new band, The Matt Martindale Band.

The Wovea are one of the ethnic groups that comprise the Sawa, or Cameroonian coastal peoples. History Wovea oral history names a man from the island of Bioko as their forebear. His ship washed ashore at Mboko, the area Southwest of Mount Cameroon, where he married a local woman. They then moved southeast and settled at Ambas Bay. The Wovea likely lived along Ambas Bay in the 17th or 18th century, and they could have participated in the same migration from Mboko that brought the Bakweri and Isubu to their current territories.Fanso 51. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Wovea came under the dominance of the Isubu. When the Spanish ousted Protestant missionaries from their base at Fernando Po (modern Bioko) in 1858, the Isubu king, William I of Bimbia, sold part of Wovea territory to British missionary Alfred Saker. The area became Victoria (today known as Limbe), and the Wovea living there were forced to move to Mondole Island. Victoria came to be a mixture of freed slaves, working Sawa, and Christianised Sawa from all the various coastal groups. Cameroonian Pidgin English began to develop at this time. In 1905, under German colonial rule, the Wovea were relocated once again to their present home west of the Wouri estuary when Mondole Island became a leper colony. After Germany's defeat in World War I, Wovea territory fell under a British League of Nations mandate. Geography and culture Map showing the location of the various Duala ethnic groups of Cameroon The Wovea live south of Mount Cameroon and on the Gulf of Guinea, in the Fako division of the Southwest Province. Their territory lies directly west of that of the Isubu. Fishing is a major form of employment and subsistence. Bobea is the Wovea language. The language had 600 speakers in 1977, although many Wovea speak Duala in lieu of their native tongue. In addition, most Wovea speak Cameroonian Pidgin English or standard English. A growing number of the Anglophones today grow up with Pidgin as their first tongue.\\"Pidgin, Cameroon\\", Ethnologue. The Wovea have been mostly Christianized since the 1970s. Evangelical denominations dominate, particularly the Baptist church. The Wovea participate in the Ngondo, a traditional festival of the Duala to which all of Cameroon's coastal Sawa peoples are invited. The main focus is on communicating with the ancestors and asking them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, beauty pageants, pirogue races, and traditional wrestling.Guide touristique 126. Classification The Wovea are Bantu in language and origin.

It aired from January 4, 1997 through August 21, 1999 as a syndicated broadcast. Shotgun Saturday Night was replaced by WWF Jakked in 1999. History The show's original concept was unusual for its time; it aired on late Saturday nights from various New York City nightlife locations. The promotion pushed the program as an \\"edgier\\" product than its normal weekly offerings. Shotgun Saturday Night debuted on January 4, 1997 from the Mirage Nightclub (Terminal 5) in New York. One of the most memorable moments of the debut episode occurred when Marlena climbed on the ring apron during a match between Goldust and The Sultan, and removed her top, causing the Sultan to be distracted and lose the match. Though she was wearing pasties, and though her back was facing the camera, this incident was a precursor for the tone of WWF programming for the next several years. Later episodes of Shotgun Saturday Night were broadcast from the All-Star Cafe in Times Square, the Mirage Nightclub on Long Island, and New York Penn Station. There were several unique elements to the show that did not appear on any other WWF programming at the time. For example, due to the confining nature of the locales it was initially broadcast from, Shotgun Saturday Night used a somewhat smaller ring than a standard 20-foot by 20-foot WWF ring. All three ring ropes were taped yellow; something that was not replicated until NXT debuted in 2010. Shortly after the show's debut, the nightclub theme was dropped and the show's matches began being taped in an arena before or after the live Monday Night Raw show. It soon replaced WWF Superstars of Wrestling as the 'B' Show, being used to recap the now two-hour Raw show with original matches featuring lower-level talent. The show originally featured commentary by Vince McMahon and Sunny, with Jim Ross and Brian Pillman performing the same duties until mid-1997, when Pillman was pulled from commentary after beating up a (planted) fan on the June 28, 1997 episode. Kevin Kelly, Michael Cole, Jim Cornette and Vince Russo also served as commentators. Stone Cold Steve Austin also served as a surprise guest commentator on one episode along with Owen Hart. Alternate versions The WWF also aired a similar syndicated show at the time called WWF Shotgun Challenge, which aired in earlier time slots (replacing WWF Challenge) and was more family-friendly. This version of the show was later renamed simply WWF Shotgun and ultimately replaced with WWF Metal in 1999. From 1997 until 1999, matches from WWF Shotgun were aired on the international version of WWF Superstars with commentary by Michael Cole and Kevin Kelly, and in January 1999, Gorilla Monsoon joined them. In the New York media market, the show was rebranded as WWF New York in 1997 and 1998, airing on WPIX and WPXN-TV, and later WLNY. It was shown late at night, airing at 2:00 a.m., Eastern time (WPXN aired the series on Saturday mornings). In March 1998, the WWF aired 11:Alive which aired the matches in the same order as WWF New York, but with different commentary that made fewer references to New York. The show aired on Saturday mornings and only ran four episodes before being discontinued. The final episode was hosted by Michael Hayes as a preview show to WrestleMania XIV.

Tassilo, then still a child, began his rule as a Frankish ward under the tutelage of his uncle, the Carolingian Mayor of the Palace Pepin the Short (later king) after Tassilo's father, Duke Odilo of Bavaria, had died in 748 and Pepin‚Äôs half-brother Grifo had tried to seize the duchy for himself. Pepin removed Grifo and installed the young Tassilo as duke, but under Frankish overlordship. Then, in 757, according to the Royal Frankish Annals, Tassilo became Pepin‚Äôs vassal and the lord for his lands at an assembly held at Compiegne. There, he is reported to have sworn numerous oaths to Pepin and, according to reports that may have been written much later, promised fealty to him and his sons, Charles and Carloman. However, the highly legalistic account is quite out of character for the period. K. L. Pearson has suggestedKathy Lynne Roper Pearson, Conflicting Loyalties in Early Medieval Bavaria: a View of Socio-Political Interaction, 680‚Äì900. (Aldershot: Ashgate), 1999. that it probably represents a reworking of the original document by the annalist to emphasise Charlemagne's overlordship over Tassilo during the period of hostilities between the two rulers. Around 760, Tassilo married Liutperga, daughter of the Lombard king, Desiderius, continuing a tradition of Lombardo- Bavarian connections. He made several journeys to Italy to visit his father in law and to establish political relations with the pope. It is reported that Tassilo had gained such a reputation that he was regarded as a kingly ruler when his cousins Charles and Carloman assumed power in the Frankish realm in 768. That year, he founded Gars Abbey on the Inn River, in southern Bavaria. In the following year, 769, Tassilo issued in Bolzano the foundation charter of the Innichen Abbey. He was, however, not able to protect the pope against Lombard expansions, which has been seen as a reason for Rome's lack of support for him during his later conflict with Charlemagne. Still, there is a consensus among historians that Tassilo, despite acting as a kingly sovereign, did not intend to become king himself. Tassilo nevertheless undertook such kingly duties as founding Kremsm√ºnster Abbey. According to legend, Tassilo discovered the body of his son, Gunther, who had been attacked by a wild boar during a hunt. In grief, he founded the monastery on the site in 777. In 763 Tassilo was accused by the Franks of defaulting on his military obligations to Pepin, leaving the Frankish campaign in Aquitaine on grounds of ill health. Pearson suggests that he left because he felt an obligation to the Aquitanians in light of an earlier alliance, made between Tassilo‚Äôs father and the Aquitanian duke during his conflict with Pepin in 743. Whatever the motivations behind Tassilo's abandonment of the campaign, the Royal Frankish Annals for that year are particularly scathing of him, saying that he \\"brushed aside his oaths and all his promises and sneaked away on a wicked pretext\\". Working on the premise that the annals may have been revised to emphasise Tassilo as a vassal, Pearson suggests that to be the beginning of a campaign to depict Tassilo as an oath-breaker and someone unprepared to carry out the main function of his office, to fight, which would make him unfit for rule. The incident was the linchpin in Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I's argument that Tassilo was not an independent prince but a rebellious vassal, deserving punishment. The punishment was carried out, after much political maneuvering, during a diet in the Imperial Palace Ingelheim in 788, when Tassilo was finally deposed and then entered a monastery. In 794, Tassilo was again compelled, at the synod of Frankfurt, to renounce his and his family's claims to Bavaria. He formally handed over to the king all of the rights that he had held.

Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) are proteins that stimulate the exchange (replacement) of nucleoside diphosphates for nucleoside triphosphates bound to other proteins. Function Many cellular proteins cleave (hydrolyze) nucleoside triphosphates-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-to their diphosphate forms (ADP and GDP) as a source of energy and to drive conformational changes. These changes in turn affect the structural, enzymatic, or signalling properties of the protein. Nucleotide exchange factors actively assist in the exchange of depleted nucleoside diphosphates for fresh nucleoside triphosphates. NEFs are specific for the nucleotides they exchange (ADP or GDP, but not both) and are often specific to a single protein or class of proteins with which they interact.

Town is 31 km to Kochi and Kottayam and 22 km north of Alappuzha town, on the Kochi-Alappuzha National Highway NH 66 (formerly 47), as well as the coastal rail route. The coastal town is also about 20 kilometers from the historical town of Vaikom Via Ullala -Chempakassery house and the popular tourism destination Kumarakom. Shelter for holy birds In local administration, the Cherthala is a municipality while in the state administrative structure Cherthala is a taluk and its headquarters in the district of Alappuzha. The Corporation of Cochin has drafted a master plan that aims to develop Cherthala as the satellite town around Kochi. Etymology According to the local legend, once Vilwamangalam Swamiyar, the well known Kerala Hindu saint, while travelling through Cherthala, found an idol of the Devi with its head immersed in a muddy pond. The swami understood the divinity of the idol, took it out of the mud, cleaned it and consecrated it in a temple near the pond. Thus the place is believed to have gotten its name as cher meaning \\"mud\\" and thala meaning \\"head\\" in Malayalam. The deity of the temple has the name Cherthala Karthiyayani. The word put together means \\"head from the mud\\". Unlike in other Kerala temples, the idol of Cherthala Karthiyayani Devi is consecrated in the Sreekovil just below the ground level and cannot be directly viewed by the devotees. There is another story that says that the former name was Karappuram and that this piece of land was given by the erstwhile State of Cochin to the erstwhile state of Travancore for protecting it from enemies. The place got its name as chertha (\\"joined\\") thala (\\"abutting land\\"). Devi temple ClimateLocal governance Cherthala taluk is a part of Alappuzha Revenue District and Alappuzha Parliamentary constituency. All the villages of Cherthala Taluk come under the Cherthala and Aroor and Alappuzha (Constituencies of Kerala Legislative Assembly.

These block panchayats are again subdivided into Grama panchayats. The Grama panchayats in Pattanakkad Block Panchayath are Aroor, Ezhupunna, Kuthiathode, Kodamthuruthu, Thuravoor, Pattanakkad and Vayalar. The Thycattussery Block Panchayath have five Grama Panchayaths, viz., Arookutty, Perumbalam, Panavally, Thycattusserry and Chennam Pallippuram.

Well-known Karnatic singers and instrumentalists include Cherthala Gopalan Nair, Thiruvizha Jayasankar, Thiruvizha Sivanandan, Cherthala K. Narayana Iyer and Cherthala Ranganatha Sarma. Many of the senior artists also have a significant number of disciples in and around Cherthala. IndustriesInland waterway Cherthala lies between the Kottapuram- Kollam National Waterway 3 passing through the Vembanad lake. Prior to the coming of NH 66, cargo and freight from Cochin market were transported in country boats through the Vembanad lake via the small lake diverting from Arukutty-Thycattuserry-Vayalar. Now these country boats are no more used for cargo transportation, instead converted into tourist floating houseboats. One can still find the canal running across the center of the town which was once the busiest waterway. One can reach Vaikom by the Thavanakadav-Vaikom ferry service covering approx 3.5 km across the Vembanad lake and joining the Kottayam district at Vaikom jetty. There are small inland waterways or rivers, which flow across the villages, still navigable through county boats. They transport coir, marine products, vegetables, paddy, sand, construction materials, etc. where roads are inaccessible. The majority of these inland rivers flow from Vembanad Lake on the eastern side and merge into the azhi or sea near Anthakaranazhi on the west coast, crossing the NH 66 at different places.  Landmarks  Cherthala Town Municipality has 35 wards.http://www.cherthalamunicipality.in Cherthala Municipality The town is well known after the Karthyayani Devi temple, located in the center of the town. Two more sub-temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu are also located on the northern side of the main temple. A sub-temple dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, also known as Kaavudayan and another dedicated to Kshethrapalakan believed to be Devi's temple caretaker are located on the southern corner of the main temple. Thousands of devotees coming from different 'karas' (localities) of Cherthala participate in the Padayani, vela thullal and pooram pattu, the main rituals conducted during the temple festival. A large pond exists in front of the Taluk office that belongs to the Karthyayani Devi temple. One can see many roosters flocking around the temple premises. These roosters are the offerings of the devotees, an ancient custom followed in many devi temples of Kerala. The temple is administered by Travancore Devaswom Board. Cherthala Back waters at 1960s Another temple in Cherthala town is the Muttathu Thirumala Devaswam temple. Lord Narasimha presiding in the form of Saligrama and Sree Venkatachalapathy Moorthy with bhoo devi and sree devi are the deities of this temple. The temple conducts its annual festival either ahead of the Karthyayani Devi's festival or soon after that. The Pallivetta is a procession where it is believed that Goddess is going for the divine hunting. The annual festival lasts for eight days.

Influences There are theories of the origin of this genre. According to the Peruvian reciter and ethnomusicologist Nicomedes Santa Cruz (1925-1992), the word \\"land√≥\\" derives from ond√∫, an African dance. It is also suggested that the land√≥ comes from the Brazilian dance lundu. Likewise, the term \\"land√≥\\" is hardly found in the literature of the time of the Viceroyalty of Peru, although there is some mention of the \\"zamba landa\\". Unfortunately, no reliable historical sources have yet been found on which an accurate description of the development of the landau in Peru can be elaborated; the only available source is the scant information provided by twentieth-century informants who witnessed the execution and the text and music of the few land√≥s that have survived. Today It is only in the 1960s that a song called \\"Samba Malat√≥\\", compiled in Lima by Nicomedes Santa Cruz, and recorded by his Conjunto \\"Cumanana\\" became popular. Since then, dance groups have recreated a choreography for this dance, as the original was lost. After this success, other land√≥s emerged such as \\"A saca camote con el pie\\" and \\"Taita Guaranguito\\", collected in the areas of Ca√±ete and Chincha. Over the years, various composers popularized various land√≥s. Rhythmic structure The basic rhythm of Land√≥ is a two-bar figure, played on the caj√≥n (B = bass, F = flam, . = rest): B . F . B B  . F B . F B ...or, alternatively: B . F . B B  . F . F . B This pattern is closely related to a bell pattern found in many African- based rhythms (L = low pitch, H = high pitch): L . H . H H  . H . H .

An 8-bit version of the game was later released for the Master System and Game Gear. The game follows Mickey Mouse on a quest to save Minnie Mouse from the evil witch Mizrabel. It was the first game in Sega's long-running Illusion video game series starring Mickey and was also a part of the second wave of games initially released for the Sega Genesis which helped seal the console's reputation within the period until the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991. Castle of Illusion was very well received by critics, especially the original 16-bit version. It was re- released in 1998 in Japan as part of the Sega Ages: Mickey Mouse & Donald Duck for the Sega Saturn, which features both Castle of Illusion and QuackShot. A remake of the game by Sega Studios Australia was released for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC in September 2013. The game was also included on the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019. Story Castle of Illusion is a side- scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of Mickey Mouse as he goes inside the Castle of Illusion in order to rescue Minnie Mouse from an evil witch named Mizrabel, who wants to steal Minnie's youth. Upon meeting and conversing with the castle's true owner and king, Mickey is told that in order to defeat Mizrabel he must find the Seven Gems of the Rainbow. Majority of the seven gems are kept within various illusion-filled worlds (known in the game as levels), and are being guarded by Mizrabel's henchmen ‚Äì which are known as the Masters of Illusion. Alongside the Masters of Illusion are bizarre creatures - such as enchanted mushrooms, toy soldiers, ball-juggling unicycle- riding clowns, and armored knights that Mickey must face. After thanking the castellan and hurrying into the castle hallway, Mickey begins to search through five doors that each lead to a different level. The levels are The Enchanted Forest, Toyland, The Storm, Dessert Factory, The Library, and finally, The Castle. Gameplay Mickey Mouse in Level 2: Toyland Mickey's main method of attack is to perform a 'bounce' whilst jumping, which can be used to defeat enemies, or to bounce upwards towards higher areas. Mickey can also collect projectiles such as apples and marbles to throw at his opponents. There are various items that earn bonus points, increase the player's health and grant extra tries. Every level ends in a boss battle against each Master of Illusion (Mizrabel's henchmen) where Mickey can earn a gem, although the final two levels award a gem half-way through. After clearing all five levels, obtaining all gems will open up the route to the witch's tower. There, the player faces the final boss: a giant and youthful version of Mizrabel (resembling a cross between the Queen and Maleficent). There is also an easy mode available where players simply play through truncated versions of the first three levels, with no boss fights. The Master System and Game Gear versions of the game feature different game mechanics, enemies, items, levels and graphics. Release The game was also included on a cartridge entitled Disney Collection, bundled with QuackShot, in 1996. An emulated version of Castle of Illusion was also included in a bundle for those who preordered its remake on PSN; this bundle was offered again for PlayStation Plus subscribers in April 2014. An 8-bit version of the game was released in 1991 for the Master System and Game Gear. Reception At the time of Castle of Illusion's release, Mean Machines gave the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version of the game a positive review, awarding it a score of 95%, specifically praising the game's graphics and playability. Mega placed it at 21st spot in their 1992 list of top Mega Drive games of all time.Mega magazine issue 1, page 76, Future Publishing, Oct 1992 According to GameSpot in 2010, \\"it wasn't just the levels that made this game so good. The music, the controls, and Mickey's superb animation all contributed to one of the very best Disney games that would heavily influence those to follow.\\" ACE called the Game Gear version \\"basically an unadulterated Mario clone‚Äîand not a bad one at that\\", giving it a score of eight out of 10. Entertainment Weekly picked the game as the #19 greatest game available in 1991, saying: \\"Perfect for younger players, but challenging enough to satisfy adults, too. A superbly animated Mickey bops through three different worlds‚Äîthe Enchanted Forest, Toyland, and the Dessert Factory‚Äîin a quest to save Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel.\\" Legacy A sequel, Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse, was released for the Master System in 1992 and for the Game Gear in 1993. World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck followed for the Genesis in 1992. In 1994, Legend of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse was released for the Game Gear, with a Master System port following in 1998 exclusively in Brazil. Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion, developed by DreamRift, was released in November 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS and serves as a spiritual successor to Castle of Illusion. In it, Mizrabel from Castle of Illusion returns as the main villain, but redesigned to resemble Maleficent. The game is also included in the first volume of Sega Mega Drive Classic Collection for PC. =Remake= A remake of the game, developed by Sega Studios Australia, was released for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC in September 2013. The game features 2.5D gameplay with 3D graphics and was developed under the supervision of the original game's director, Emiko Yamamoto, with a reimagined soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope. The original game was made available as a pre-order bonus for the PSN version.

A fully owned subsidiary of Universal Music Group and distributed by Capitol Music Group's Blue Note Records, the label evolved through an expansion of formats to include world music, jazz, Celtic music, new flamenco, acoustic guitar, and piano genre releases. Label history In 1979, John Morey started a mail-order business to sell new-age music. This led to the creation of Narada in Milwaukee in 1983, and the roster eventually included David Arkenstone, Jesse Cook, Michael Gettel, Michael Jones, David Lanz, Oscar Lopez, and Billy McLaughlin. Virgin bought Narada in 1997, along with Higher Octave and Back Porch, and directly signed Yanni and other New Age/Smooth Jazz acts. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Narada created several sub-label imprints to differentiate its offerings, in particular Sona Gaia, Antiquity Records, Rising Sun Records, Narada World, Narada Equinox, Narada Jazz, and Narada Mystique. Since the acquisition, Narada was the principal U.S. licensee for Peter Gabriel's Real World Records until 2008. The sub-labels of Narada were retired and their albums folded into the company's main imprint, Narada. Shakti Records was created in 2000 for electronic music, but the last release was in 2004 as Narada concentrated on contemporary jazz. Higher Octave and Back Porch were absorbed into Narada in 2004 as sub-labels, without the original staff, significantly reducing their roster of artists and albums. In 2005, Narada was named No. 4 in the 2005 top four contemporary jazz labels in Billboard magazine's year-end charts. In 2006, EMI moved Narada from Milwaukee suburb Glendale, Wisconsin to EMI headquarters in New York City, to become part of the expanded role for Blue Note, EMI's consolidated label group for music for adults. Likewise merged in were Mosaic, Capitol Jazz, Roulette Jazz, Pacific Jazz, Manhattan, Angel, and Metro Blue; announced plans were to continue using existing imprints. As part of this consolidation, Narada's involvement with new-age music was reduced with Narada's focus narrowed to mainly contemporary jazz; new-age would be put on sister label Higher Octave.

He supports the Earth which he balances on a spinning pole. He receives an annual application of wild duck-oil to his muscles from a servant which brings relief to his muscles. The belief is that when all the ducks are hunted out, there will no longer be any duck-oil available in the world. At this point, Amala dies and the world topples off the pole and comes to an end. The myth The name Amala refers to his being very dirty and literally means ‚Äúsmoke hole.‚Äù Amala is said to be the youngest child in a family who is physically weak and lazy. He is made to sleep in the ashes and suffers mistreatment from everybody. In many variants of the myth, Amala sleeps in his urine. Late in his life he attains supernatural strength in secret and becomes a handsome, and powerful young man who performs many daring feats and turns savior and protector for his relatives against their enemies. The concluding feat of his life is to succeed a dying chief on an island in the Southwest sea in the task of holding the Earth up. The dying chief hears of Amala's various exploits and, impressed by his prowess, calls the hero. When Amala arrives, the chief hands over the long pole upon which the flat world revolves. Some versions of the myth state that the chief places the pole on Amala's chest, while some versions hold that the pole is held behind Amala's back. A servant relieves Amala's muscles with yearly application of spoonfuls of duck grease and wild- duck oil which help Amala to keep the world spinning. Possible influences There is a possibility that the myths about Amala and similar heroes of Native American mythology were influenced by the tales of Cinderella and Atlas - the titan who carries the world on his shoulder in Greek mythology, introduced into Native American culture from Europe. There is a similarity between Cinderella and Amala in that both sleep in ashes and both are abused by their tribe or family. The storyline of Amala - the despised member of the tribe who overcomes adversity and rises to be a hero among his people, may be a combination of elements of the downtrodden and derided hero or heroine, such as Cinderella, and the hero of the Atlas-type who dwells in the underworld.

It includes a model/terrain editor, a level editor, a script editor/debugger and comes with a big collection of textures, models and artwork, as well as a game template system that allows the creation of basic shooter games or RPGs without programming. For complex games or other applications, either the integrated programming language named Lite-C or an external development language such as Visual C++ or Borland Delphi can be used. Gamestudio is marketed at users of various skill levels, providing three different levels of usage (\\"beginner\\", \\"advanced\\", and \\"professional\\") for hobbyists, artists, as well as programmers. Additionally, Conitec also markets the system for uses such as advergame development and the creation of real- time presentations, simulations, and virtual exhibitions. Most published titles made from Gamestudio are created by development teams of only 2 to 3 developers. There is also a large online community of users in support of the development system. History * 1993 ACK 3D (Animation Construction Kit) by Lary Myers (Wolfenstein-like open source engine ) * 1994 ACK NEXT GENERATION by Johann Christian Lotter / oP Group (improved version of ACK 3D, open source) * 1995 ACKNEX-2 written for the German TV show X-BASE (engine comparable to Doom) * 1995 ACKNEX-2 becomes Conitec property and is released as '3D GameStudio' * 1997 ACKNEX-3 released * 1999 A4 released (Windows Based Quake-like Engine) * 2000 A5 released (Terrain Engine) * 2003 A6 released (Physics and Shaders) * 2007 A7 released (new ABT renderer and Lite-C) * 2010 A8 released (Enet Network Library, Nvidia PhysX, PSSM) Free updates are normally available once every 4 to 8 weeks. Gamestudio / A8 has 2 different meanings. The Gamestudio part refers to the editors and game template system, but the A8 part refers to the game engine. Game engine The A8 engine uses panes for physics simulation. The engine automatically updates the game state on all machines when playing over a network, but also provides functions for more low-level multiplayer programming. It uses an ABT (Adaptive Binary Tree) renderer for indoor and outdoor levels, and an additional BSP renderer for indoor levels. The BSP renderer is only available in the Pro edition. The free edition and Extra edition don't support shaders. The engine supports high resolutions, terrain rendering, pre-rendered shadow maps and dynamic stencil shadows (single dynamic shadows for models). The 2D system (GUI system) of the A8 Engine is not very powerful (see scripting section), but replaceable using the 3D system if needed. Using Lite-C, most things can be customized. Shader model 3.0 support and post-processing using stages may assist shader programmers in chaining together effects to produce any number of custom-made shader effects. The editors Gamestudio supplies users with an editing suite. However, software like Blender, 3ds Max, Maya and Adobe Photoshop or GIMP can also be used to create professional imagery and models for Gamestudio. The editors allow users to put together games by creating a terrain or building environment, inserting models, and adding behaviors to them from template scripts or own scripts. If desired, users can create their own models and designs, textures, and scripts. Textures are created in external paint programs like GIMP, Photoshop, Paintshop Pro or Microsoft Paint. =The world editor (WED)= The World Editor (or WED for short), is the main editor. With it, the user may position the various objects, assign actions to models (also known as entities) which are defined through scripts, assign textures to level geometry, and build levels using the Binary space partitioning tree (or BSP for short) technique. WED is the main program of Gamestudio, the user can startup their game from here, attach the scripts to it, etc. WED is the location where the user can merge all the parts of their game (programming, 3d graphics, levels). The layout for WED is fairly simple. The main part, the central right section, is where most of the editing is done. There are three graphs and a 3D view. Through re-arrangeable, the top left window is the top view, which has the X and Y coordinates. The bottom left is the side view, or the X and Z coordinates. The bottom right is the back view, or the Y and Z coordinates. The top right is the 3D view, which gives a quick preview of the level without building (compiling) it. The graphs are split into multiples of 128 and further split into multiples of 16 to help with snapping and spacing. The graphs will automatically resize when zoomed out a bit and in steps of multiples of 8 (1024 and 128 then 8192 and 1024). The left central section lists objects in the level, textures, and some other things. Textures must be of a power of 2 (such as 256√ó128, 1024√ó256, or 64√ó64) for best effects. Odd ones (like 394√ó213 or 723√ó1280) look worse and are slower at rendering. The top is the tool bar which allows the user to manipulate objects, add new objects (such as entities, sounds, and lights), build a level, run it, and several other options. When right-clicking on something and choosing properties, the user can manually enter a position, assign an action to an entity, or adjust textures on the individual sides of a block. A disadvantage of WED is its incapability to do anything without blocks or terrain. E.g. it is really hard to build a street (that is not just a plane), because it is nearly impossible to move the blocks in the perfect position, so no \\"steps\\" or gaps are in the street (it is just not possible to get the edges of the blocks perfectly together, the snap-to-grid-feature helps only when using nearly non-rotated blocks). Triangles or a snap-block-edge-to- block-edge feature would fix that and would make it possible to make a more complex floor out of more than one single block without gaps or steps. Screenshot from the World Editor (WED) =The model editor (MED)= Though many users prefer to use external modeling programs, the model editor (or MED for short), gives you the capabilities to design models, and is sometimes used to make levels. Models can be made of anything ranging from simple boxes, to human models or complex environments like an entire city. Models are made of meshes, a group of vertices and triangles (often called \\"polygons\\") put together to form a shape; a skeleton of bones for animation; one or several textures for the skin; and effect files (.fx) for shaders. Like WED, MED's general layout is almost the same. It has the three graphs and the 3D view. They are arranged in the same way as WED. MED is somewhat like WED in the general layout, but MED also has a skin editor, which allows the model to be textured. The skin editor has a completely different layout. The texture is shown on the left side and the model is shown on the right with tool bars surrounding these. Textures are frequently created in external graphics editors and imported from a BMP, TGA, or PCX image file. MED uses UV mapping which has vertices from the model's mesh placed on the texture to texture the model. Model shapes are created either through primitives (like cubes and pyramids) or by creating vertices and building faces. Models don't have to follow the restrictions that BSP has which, along with faster rendering, makes them a better choice for level design in most cases. =The script editor (SED)= The script editor, SED, is a plain text editor with a compiler and debugger. However, key words like \\"function\\", \\"alpha\\", variable types, or numbers are highlighted in different colors for ease of identification, line numbers help to find syntax errors given by the engine faster, a code jumper allows jumping to different functions, actions and objects, and other functions further assist in programming and organizing projects. The script editor is used to program in Lite-c or C-Script (a scripting language somewhat similar to C used in previous generations but supported for compatibility's sake). =The game editor (GED)= GED is just like WED, but creating levels in realview (realtime). It doesn't support creating blocks or lights, yet. Screenshot from the Game Editor (GED) Scripting and Programming Gamestudio uses two different types of script, C-Script and Lite-C. C-Script was the old scripting language of Gamestudio. It is still supported, but was replaced by Lite-C in A7 and is not recommended anymore for new projects. C-Script is a simplified version of C programming. It only includes one type of variable, a var, and does not support classes. Lite-C was introduced in 2007. It is similar to the real C language, but includes many aspects that make it easier than C. Unlike C-Script, Lite-C supports the full C/C++ variable set, structs, and external classes, and is compiled instead of interpreted. It offers access to the DirectX command set as well as to the Windows API. Lite-C supports classes from external libraries, but a user cannot define their own classes in Lite-C. There is also a free standalone version of Lite-C, which can be used separately from Gamestudio. Intense X The Intense X plug-in is designed to assist in creation within Gamestudio without programming, integrating into the level editor. Intense X uses artificial intelligence and pathfinding engines that attempt to remove the ‚Äúcookie cutter‚Äù look that often accompanies other game design packages. Intense X is open source and can be expanded and customized for users with programming experience. Adding NPC behavior The editions Gamestudio has four different editions. All editions come with free updates within an engine version (Free within A8, but not from A7.x to A8.x). They also all come with the model editor, level editor, and script editor. Games created in all editions may be published with the exception of Team editions. *The Free edition has WED level editor, the shadow mapping compiler and the game template system that allows 'clicking together' games from prefabricated scripts and components. Scripts are compiled at runtime and there is a watermark on the game screen. *The Extra edition adds the ability to create precompiled scripts. It costs $99. *The Commercial edition adds multiplayer networking and shaders. It costs $199. *The Professional Edition is for commercial game companies and includes security mechanisms and a file packer. It costs $899. There are three main online magazines which provide new tips, tricks and tutorials. Two of them (3AM and 3PM) are paid for, while the third, Acknex User Magazine (AUM for short) is free, created and published monthly by George Dan Pirvu. In addition to the manual, there are several tutorials available ranging from basic things such as how to use WED, MED, and/or SED to more advanced things such as how to design multiplayers levels, editing shades, or creating interactive environments.

The challenge arises from the requirement that the set of qualified users can change in each broadcast emission, and therefore revocation of individual users or user groups should be possible using broadcast transmissions, only, and without affecting any remaining users. As efficient revocation is the primary objective of broadcast encryption, solutions are also referred to as revocation schemes. Rather than directly encrypting the content for qualified users, broadcast encryption schemes distribute keying information that allows qualified users to reconstruct the content encryption key whereas revoked users find insufficient information to recover the key. The typical setting considered is that of a unidirectional broadcaster and stateless users (i.e., users do not keep bookmarking of previous messages by the broadcaster), which is especially challenging. In contrast, the scenario where users are supported with a bi-directional communication link with the broadcaster and thus can more easily maintain their state, and where users are not only dynamically revoked but also added (joined), is often referred to as multicast encryption. The problem of practical broadcast encryption has first been formally studied by Amos Fiat and Moni Naor in 1994. Since then, several solutions have been described in the literature, including combinatorial constructions, one-time revocation schemes based on secret sharing techniques, and tree-based constructions. In general, they offer various trade-offs between the increase in the size of the broadcast, the number of keys that each user needs to store, and the feasibility of an unqualified user or a collusion of unqualified users being able to decrypt the content. Luby and Staddon have used a combinatorial approach to study the trade-offs for some general classes of broadcast encryption algorithms. A particularly efficient tree-based construction is the \\"subset difference\\" scheme, which is derived from a class of so-called subset cover schemes. The subset difference scheme is notably implemented in the AACS for HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc encryption. A rather simple broadcast encryption scheme is used for the CSS for DVD encryption. The problem of rogue users sharing their decryption keys or the decrypted content with unqualified users is mathematically insoluble. Traitor tracing algorithms aim to minimize the damage by retroactively identifying the user or users who leaked their keys, so that punitive measures, legal or otherwise, may be undertaken.

He went on to be a sire. He is now best known for the unusual spelling of his name, pronounced Potatoes. Background Potoooooooo (also spelled Pot-8-Os, Pot8Os, Pot8O's or Pot 8 Os from various sources) was a chestnut colt bred by Willoughby Bertie, 4th Earl of Abingdon, in 1773. He was sired by the undefeated Eclipse. He was the first foal out of Sportsmistress, who was sired by Warren's Sportsman and traced to Thwaites' Dun Mare from family number 38 on her dam's side.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), Thoroughbred Breeding of the World, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 The origin of his name has several different versions. According to the most common, Abingdon intended to call the young colt \\"Potato\\" and instructed the stable boy to write the name on a feed bin. The stable boy spelled the name as \\"Potoooooooo\\" (Pot followed by 8 \\"o\\"s; that is, a failed attempt at spelling phonetically), which so amused Abingdon that he adopted the spelling. Subsequent writers have used a variety of spellings that reflect the intended revised pronunciation, \\"Potatoes\\". In The Jockey Club's online database equineline.com, the name is spelled as Pot8O's. The General Stud Book uses Potoooooooo. Racing career Potoooooooo raced from 1776 to 1783, accumulating from 28 to 34 wins from an estimated 40 starts, mostly in 4 mile races on Newmarket's Beacon course. In 1776, he won a 100 guinea sweepstakes at Newmarket's first spring meeting. In 1777 at age four, he finished second in two Newmarket races for 4 year old colts, third at Nottingham, and fifth in the Great Subscription Purse at York. In 1778 at age five, Potoooooooo was entered in the 1200 Guineas Stakes at Newmarket's first spring meeting. During the race, Abingdon sold the horse to Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor for 1,500 guineas. Potoooooooo won the race and subsequently raced under Grosvenor's yellow and black silks. His subsequent wins that year included the 140 guineas subscription purse at the second spring meeting, a subscription at Ipswich, a ¬£50 purse at Swaffham and another subscription race at Newmarket's second October meeting. In 1779 at age six, he won a number of races at Newmarket, including the Gold Cup, a walkover for the Clermont Cup and the October Cup. In 1780, he again won several races at Newmarket, including the 140 guineas subscription purse where he beat King Fergus, the Jockey Club Plate and another walkover in the Clermont Cup. He also raced twice against Sir Charles Davers' Woodpecker, Herod's best son from these years, winning once. In 1781, he won the Jockey Club Plate and the Whip, both by walkover, plus a 400 guineas sweep. In October, he received 85 guineas \\"by common consent\\" as a reward for not starting in the 140 guineas subscription purse. In 1782, he had a third walkover in the Clermont, won the Jockey Club Plate for a third time, and was victorious in the Craven Stakes, beating thirteen mostly younger horses. In 1783 at age ten, he won the Whip at Newmarket, but lost a 300 guineas match race to Assassin, who had won the previous year's Derby, and a 200 guineas sweepstakes. Stud career In 1784, Potoooooooo was retired to stud at Oxcroft Farm near Balsham, Cambridgeshire, where he mostly covered mares owned by Grosvenor. For other mares, his stud fee was initially 5 guineas, gradually increasing to 21 guineas. In 1796, he was relocated to Upper Hare Park near Newmarket. During his career, Potoooooooo sired 172 winners of ¬£61,971. His leading offspring include: * Nightshade (foaled 1785), winner of the Oaks in 1788 * Asparagus (1787), a good runner and sire of Rhoda (winner of the 1000 Guineas in 1816) * Waxy (1790), who won the Derby Stakes in 1793 and ten other races. Waxy was the leading sire in 1810 and is responsible for the continuation of the Eclipse sire line to the present day. * Sister to Edwin (1794), taproot mare of Family 3-i and the susbsequent branch Family 3-l * Champion (1797), the first horse to win both the Derby and the St. Leger Stakes (in 1800) * Tyrant (1799), Derby winner in 1802 * Parasol (1800), who won many races and was a dam of Classic winners Pindarrie (2000 Guineas) and Pastille (Oaks and 2000 Guineas) * Mandane (1800), taproot mare of Family 11-g. Dam of Manuella (1812 Oaks Stakes), Altisidora (St Leger), Lottery (Doncaster Cup) and Brutandorf (Chester Cup) Potoooooooo died in November 1800 at the age of 27 and was buried at Hare Park. Some 200 years later, his skeleton was uncovered when a tree blew over. The skeleton is on display at the Kings Yard Galleries of the National Horseracing Museum in Newmarket. Pedigree Potoooooooo was sired by the undefeated Eclipse, who was also a very successful stallion even though he never led the sire list. His dam was Sportsmistress, whose dam Golden Locks was inbred 2 √ó 2 to Crab ‚Äì he was both her maternal and paternal grandsire. Sportsmistress would produce a total of 11 foals including Sir Thomas, winner of the 1788 Derby. Pot-8-Os is inbred 4 √ó 4 to the Godolphin Arabian, meaning the latter appears twice in the fourth generation of Pot-8-Os pedigree.

He became a writer for funk and soul artists such as the O'Jays and The Spinners. In 1972 he would record for Paramount, releasing a single called \\"Double Dutch\\" under the name Franklin Franklin, but the record failed to become a hit. He was also influential in the careers of the rappers Tone Loc, Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg. With his 1981 single \\"Double Dutch Bus\\", released by WMOT Records, Smith popularized a nonsensical form of slang (from his song \\"Slang thang\\", 1981 WMOT, Records), in which \\"iz\\" is placed in the middle of a word (for example, the word \\"place\\" becomes \\"plizace\\"), or the last letters of a word are replaced with \\"-izzle\\" (for example, sure becomes shizzle). The style became part of hip-hop slang, and was popularized by rappers Snoop Dogg and E-40. The style today holds a place in popular slang. \\"Double Dutch Bus\\" has been sampled frequently in hip-hop, including Snoop Dogg's \\"Snoop Dogg (What's My Name, Pt. 2)\\" and Missy Elliott's \\"Gossip Folks\\".

The A.V. Fomin Botanical Garden is one of the oldest botanical gardens in Ukraine, located in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.http://www.botanic.kiev.ua/#eng/ (Ukrainian) In 1839 the Kyiv Taras Shevchenko University opened its own botanical garden. The botanical garden is 22.5 hectares (0.225 km¬≤), with 8,000 plant species, including 143 recorded in the Ukraine's Red Book of Rare Species. The Garden is famous for its exotic plants: it has the biggest collection of succulents among the countries of the former Soviet Union. The greenhouse, which was built for the largest and the oldest palm trees in Northern Eurasia, is among the highest in the world. In 1935 the garden was named after the academician and botanist Aleksandr Vasiljevich Fomin, who directed the garden for years. The vestibule of the Kyiv Metro station Universytet, is located on the northern edge of the garden, which was opened in 1960.(Google Maps link).  History  Architect V.I. Beretti who as well known by his project of Kyiv University, was the first who raised issue of botanical garden establishment in 1834. He proposed to place the garden on the waste territory near the university buildings. For this purpose, from Kremenets Lyceum (Kyiv) 513 plants were brought, that were temporarily placed in the Tsar (now City) garden. However, due to lack of funds the garden establishment was postponed for 5 years. Only in 1839 the Kyiv school district administration gave permission for a temporary Botanical Garden start under the direction of Head of the Botany department of Kyiv University Ernst Trautvetter, who then managed the Botanical Garden in the position of Director. The official date of the Kyiv Botanical Garden establishment is 22 May 1839, when E. Trautfetter started the first plantings. In 1841 the garden received its permanent status. In 1850 design and layout of the garden were completed. By 1852 there were 25,416 trees and 419 species of shrubs, as well as more than 4,000 species of other plants in the garden. 1941 - 1943 - during the Nazi occupation, many precious plants from the collection were lost. Some plants were transported to Germany. In the spring of 1944 the garden was reopened to the public, the restoration of greenhouses and plant collections started. In 1960 the garden was declared an artifact of landscape art of the national importance. In 1977 a greenhouse-climatron was built at the Garden, that was one of the largest in the world at that time. = Directors = * 1852 - 1879 - University professor Afanasiy Rogovich * 1879 - 1894 - a prominent botanist, the Botany professor Schmalhausen headed the Botanical Garden * 1894 - 1914 - Sergey Navashin.

Early life and career Davis was born in Aurora, Indiana, the son of a cashier for the First National Bank of Aurora. One of his first professional writing jobs was with the Indianapolis Star, a position he held while attending Franklin College. A brilliant student, Davis received a Rhodes Scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford in 1910. His stay in England was cut short when his father fell ill and eventually died. Davis met his wife, Florence, in England. Upon his return to America, Davis became an editor for the pulp magazine Adventure, leaving after a year to work as a reporter and editorial writer for The New York Times. For the next decade, Davis reported on stories ranging from pugilist Jack Dempsey to evangelist Billy Sunday. It was his coverage of Billy Sunday that gained him notoriety. Davis later left The New York Times and became a freelance writer. Davis' best-known work is his company history History of the New York Times. 1851‚Äì1921 (New York: The New York Times, 1921). In 1928 Davis published his one and only novel Giant Killer, a retelling of the Biblical story of David. Radio In August 1939, Paul White, the news chief at CBS, asked Davis to fill in as a news analyst for H. V. Kaltenborn, who was off in Europe reporting on the increasingly hostile events. Davis became an instant success. Edward R. Murrow later commented that one reason he believed that Davis was likeable was his Hoosier accent, which reminded people of a friendly neighbor. By 1941, the audience for Davis' nightly five-minute newscast and comment was 12.5 million. On June 1, 1941, Colgate-Palmolive-Peet began sponsoring seven- days-a-week newscasts by Davis on CBS. The program was carried on 95 stations from 8:55 to 9 p.m., Eastern Time. Office of War Information Davis spent two and a half years reporting the news on radio and gaining the trust of the nation. Then, in 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed Davis as the director of the newly created United States Office of War Information, a sprawling organization with over 3,000 employees. Even though Davis was being paid $53,000 per year from CBS, he left the network to work in government during the crisis of World War II. As Director of the Office of War Information, Davis recommended to President Roosevelt that Japanese-Americans be permitted to enlist for service in the Army and Navy and urged him to oppose bills in Congress that would deprive Nisei of citizenship and intern them during the war. He argued that Japanese propaganda proclaiming it a racial war could be combated by deeds that counteracted this.John Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936‚Äì1945 p 453 Random House New York 1970 Davis has been termed one of the \\"unsung forefathers\\" of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, an all-Nisei combat unit in the war.Japanese American Voice Davis was also instrumental in loosening censorship rules that forbade the publication of images of dead GIs on the battlefield. Until late 1943, the U.S. Office of Censorship only permitted the media to publish images of blanket-covered bodies and flag-draped coffins of dead U.S. soldiers, partly for fear that Americans would be demoralized if they had any graphic understanding of the human price being paid in the war. The government also restricted what reporters could write, and coverage was generally upbeat and bloodless. Davis believed that the American public \\"had a right to be truthfully informed\\" about the war within the dictates of military security. He asked President Roosevelt to lift the ban on publishing photographs of dead GIs on the battlefield on the grounds that the American people needed to appreciate the sacrifices made by their young men. Roosevelt agreed. Life published a photograph taken by George Strock of three American soldiers who were killed on the beach during the Battle of Buna-Gona, the first photograph published that depicted American soldiers dead on the battlefield. Censorship was loosened, but the media was still forbidden from showing the faces of the dead or the insignia of the units they belonged to. Postwar career Following the war, Davis continued his career in radio, using the platform to criticize Senator Joseph McCarthy for his anti-communist investigations.Jim Widner's Radio Days Davis was one of the four journalists who portrayed themselves in the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still, and he was the host and narrator of the ABC television series, Pulitzer Prize Playhouse (1950‚Äì52), which won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. He was a longstanding member of The Baker Street Irregulars, the literary society dedicated to keeping green the memory of Sherlock Holmes. On June 29, 1952, the Washington Post published a two-page essay by Davis, which he opened by questioning \\"how long will these former Communists and former sympathizers abuse the patience of the vast majority which had sense enough never to be Communists in the first place?\\" He cited their \\"arrogance\\" as the most \\"irritating thing\\" about them. he specifically mentioned Whittaker Chambers, who at that time were testifying before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Davis retired from broadcasting in 1953 after suffering a heart attack. Personal life and death Davis died in May 1958 of complications from a stroke.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat;=19580519&id;=-S9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=GOcDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2861,983544&hl;=en Legacy Davis was considered to be one of the greatest news reporters of the mid-20th century, on a level with Edward R.

The game covers the Battle of Jutland, fought in May and June 1916 between the British Grand Fleet and the German High Seas Fleet off the Jutland coast of Denmark. The game is unusual for an Avalon Hill game in that there is no mapboard. Instead, the game operates on two levels: a higher level in which the two players use pencil marks on pre-printed paper maps of the North Sea to plot movements of their fleets, and, once fleets come into contact, a lower level in which the players deploy cardboard pieces each representing a single capital ship or a flotilla of light cruisers or destroyers on any convenient flat (and large) surface. Game play at the lower level is more like miniature play than like Avalon Hill's traditional hexgrid mapboard game. The game provided custom rulers for determining movement. The rulers had a rounded end for changing the direction of a line of ships. The game's instructions noted that the ship counters were not to scale in relation to movement rulers. Instructions were included for the gamer to make scale movement rulers. A large room was required to play at this scale.

The bass- side keyboard is usually the Stradella system or one of the various free-bass systems. Included among chromatic button accordions are the Russian bayan and Schrammel accordion. There can be 3 to 5 rows of vertical treble buttons. In a 5 row chromatic, two additional rows repeat the first 2 rows to facilitate options in fingering. Chromatic button system (type C) Chromatic button system (type B) Comparing the layout to the piano accordion,Dan Lindgren, Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion Online PDF the advantages of a chromatic button accordion are the greater range and better fingering options.The uniform layout allows for uniform fingering and making of chords; meanwhile, the chromatic button layout also allows for alternative fingerings. As the buttons are closer, it is also easier to reach notes that are far apart, such as two octaves apart. On the other hand, some fingering positions require twisting of the wrist and the aspect of alternative fingering patterns may stunt one in sessions of difficult sight reading. Throughout the former Yugoslavia a 6-row chromatic button layout is used based on the B system. It is referred to as dugmetara.  History  Early accordions were bisonoric instruments resembling modern diatonic button accordions. The first unisonoric accordions were built in Russia in the first half of the 1840s, with chromaticism not appearing until the 1850s. There are several conflicting claims of the invention of the first chromatic button accordion. The first chromatic button accordion may have been constructed as early as 1850 by Franz Walther, in 1870 by Nikolai I. Belobodorev, or as late as 1891 by Georg Mirwald. Many early chromatic button accordions were similar in design to the schrammel accordion. As the Stradella bass system would not be invented until later, these accordions often employed systems that would be considered unusual on a modern chromatic accordion, such as bisonoric bass buttons.This can also be seen in photographs and illustrations of such accordions; Their bass keyboard does not have the characteristic angled rows of the Stradella bass system Early chromatic button accordions were less popular than their diatonic counterpoints and unstandardized. The modern chromatic button accordion, featuring the Stradella bass system, was patented in 1897 by Paolo Soprani, with the assistance of Mattia Beraldi and Raimondo Piatanesi. Its production and sale by Paolo Soprani helped globally spread and standardize the chromatic button accordion.

More importantly, it included Norman's measurement of magnetic dip, the incline at an angle from the horizon by a compass needle discovered by Georg Hartmann in 1544. This effect is caused by the Earth's magnetic field not running parallel to the planet's surface. Norman demonstrated magnetic dip by creating a compass needle that pivoted on a horizontal axis. The needle tilted at a steep angle relative to the horizon line. Magnetic inclination and local variations were known before Robert Norman, but his pamphlet had a greater influence than the earlier work. The crater Norman on the Moon is named in his honour.

The high, five part bridge on four piers spans False Creek, connecting downtown Vancouver with Kitsilano via connections to Burrard Street on both ends. It is one of three bridges crossing False Creek. The other two bridges are the Granville Bridge, three blocks or to the southeast, and the Cambie Street Bridge, about 11 blocks or to the east. In addition to the vehicle deck, the Burrard Bridge has wide sidewalks and a dedicated cycling lane on both sides. The architect of the Burrard Street Bridge was George Lister Thornton Sharp, the engineer John R. Grant. The bridge's two close approach spans are Warren trusses placed below deck level, while its central span is a Pratt truss placed above deck level to allow greater clearance height for ships passing underneath. The central truss is hidden when crossing the bridge in either direction by vertical extensions of the bridge's masonry piers into imposing concrete towers, connected by overhead galleries, which are embellished with architectural and sculptural details that create a torch-like entrance of pylons. Busts of Captain George Vancouver and Sir Harry Burrard-Neale in ship prows jut from the bridge's superstructure (a V under Vancouver's bust, a B under Burrard's). Unifying the long approaches and the distinctive central span are heavy concrete railings, originally topped with decorative street lamps. These pierced handrails were designed as a kind of visual shutter (stroboscopic effect), so that at a speed of 50 km/h motorists would see through them with an uninterrupted view of the harbour. The effect works at speeds from about 40 to 64 km/h. History Burrard Bridge circa 1932, with original street lamps. The Burrard Street Bridge, opened July 1, 1932, was built to provide a high-level crossing from Vancouver to the southwestern neighbourhoods in Kitsilano, by connecting Burrard Street to Cedar Street. After completion, Burrard was extended through to the base of downtown and Cedar Street disappeared. At the opening ceremony, entertainment was provided by two bands, the Kitsilano Boy's Band and the Fireman's Band. An RCAF seaplane flew under the bridge and later a sugar replica of the bridge was unveiled at the civic reception in the Hotel Vancouver. G.L. Thornton Sharp, of Sharp and Thompson, was the architect responsible for the distinctive towers on the bridge and its middle galleries. \\"Both central piers,\\" Sharp told a reporter, \\"were designed and connected with an overhead gallery across the road. This helped to mask the network of steel in the truss from the two approaches, and has been treated as an entrance gateway to the city.\\" Along their other axis, the full height of the piers above the water also serve to frame a sea entrance gateway, notably for pleasure craft: \\"by sea and land we prosper\\". The piers have provision for a rapid transit vertical lift span beneath the highway deck, never installed. Canadian World War I prisoners of war, who huddled around open fires in their prison camps, John Grant had the idea to install huge lamps at both ends of the span. For placement of the lamps:.Burrard Street bridge sur Flickr : partage de photos ! Recognition Burrard Street Bridge has been assessed by heritage consultants retained by the City of Vancouver as being in the top category of historic buildings in Vancouver. The bridge appeared on a stamp issued by Canada Post in 2011, in a series showcasing five notable Art Deco structures in Canada. Proposed bicycle lanes or widening When constructed, the Burrard Street Bridge did not have dedicated lanes for cyclists, who shared the bridge's six vehicle lanes with motorists. Later, as traffic volume grew and speed limits were increased on the bridge to 60 km/h, cyclists were directed to share the bridge's sidewalks with pedestrians. Over time, the volume of pedestrians and cyclists on the sidewalks created a dangerous situation, with several accidents occurring, which resulted in at least one successful lawsuit against the city. Since the mid-1990s, the city of Vancouver has investigated various options to rectify the situation. The two most prominent options were 1) to introduce bicycle lanes on the bridge's vehicle deck by reallocating one or more vehicle lanes, and 2) to build horizontal extensions on the outside of the bridge to create additional sidewalk space. Other options have included building an entirely new pedestrian and/or cyclist only bridge, and building another deck on the bridge below the existing deck. Heritage advocates have been strongly opposed to the construction of outside sidewalk extensions, which would likely alter significantly the historical character of the bridge. Fiscal conservatives have also been opposed to high costs associated with this option. Many motorists and others have opposed reallocation of vehicle lanes to bicycle lanes, believing that the reduction in vehicle carrying capacity would create excessive traffic problems both on the bridge and on and around alternate crossings, such as the Granville Street Bridge. =Timeline= Beginning March 26, 1996, in a six-month trial by the City, one commuter lane was closed to automobile traffic and made into a temporary cyclist lane. However, after one week, the City was forced to revert the lane to its original purpose, due to outrage by some motorists. On May 31, 2005, a detailed engineering and planning report was presented to Council, reviewing the situation broadly, presenting alternatives, and offering recommendations. (Its computer visualizations of various proposals [esp. pp. 8‚Äì12‚Äînotably p. 8‚Äîand Appendix E] are indispensable illustrations to the discussion. See ) That day Vancouver City Council voted 10‚Äì1 not to follow the recommendations of the report, but to reallocate the two curb-side lanes to cyclists for another trial, as part of Council's plan to increase cycling in Vancouver by 10 percent for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The issue was carried into the municipal election of November 19, 2005. On December 20, 2005 the newly elected Council voted 6-4 to cancel the lane reallocation trial and to proceed directly to widening the bridge sidewalks as promised in that election. East (city) pylon with decorations, masking steel through-truss; six traffic lanes, pedestrian arches, concrete railings In 2006, the City considered removing the concrete railings and widening the bridge deck by outward ('outrigger') sidewalks, at projected cost of over $40 million. (See p. 8 of ) To preserve the bridge's heritage value, such cantilevered structures would not include the bridge's central piers, or towers. Critics of this plan argued that the resulting \\"pinch points\\" would defeat the purpose of widening the bridge by creating bottlenecks, through which a greater number of cyclists, skaters and pedestrians must pass over coming decades.For heritage formal statement opposing the proposal, see . For the third consecutive year, in 2008 Heritage Vancouver listed the Burrard Bridge first on its Top Ten endangered sites in Vancouver. It had ranked fourth in 2005.For HV's 2008 ranking, see . For HV's general position on the matter, as well as historical photographs, see . Sidewalk expansion was delayed by the Squamish First Nation, which controls the land directly under the south (or west) side of the bridge. For construction to begin, the city would require permission from this group, which has expressed concern that machinery working on the site may affect their land. The Squamish First Nation erected advertising billboards on their properties, located at that bridge approach, and is proposing the same for similar properties by the Lions' Gate Bridge and the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing. Oblique view from northwest (Kitsilano) quadrant, showing existing change of line between central and approach spans, relative to deck grade-level, 'outrigger', cantilevered widening plan In a late April 2008 report to Council, city engineers raised the estimated cost of widening to $57 million, due to reconsideration of the additional weight to the existing bridge structure and rising construction costs. $61 million was set as a more likely figure.\\"Estimate for bike lanes on Burrard Bridge hits $57M\\", CBC, April 29, 2008 In Nov. 2008 the current Council, which advocated widening the bridge, was defeated and replaced by a new mayor and Council opposed to the widening but supportive of lane reallocation from vehicles to cyclists. In late January 2009, in an economic downturn and anticipating the 2010 Winter Olympics, the City announced plans for trials of three kinds of auto traffic lane closings, allowing bicycle use of the road surface. This would be supplemented by safety upgrades.Graeme Wood, \\"Burrard Street Bridge may finally gets its bike lane\\", Vancouver Sun, 1 Feb. 2009 . In March 2009, the City of Vancouver delayed discussing the Burrard Bridge Bike Lane Trial at least one month. . Council rescheduled meeting to May 5, 2009 to discuss the three kinds of possible trials, to begin summer 2009, where one approved.\\"Summer bike lane test set for Burrard Bridge\\", CBC, April 30, 2009. On May 7, 2009, Council approved a motion to proceed with option 3 of the proposed trials, to begin in June 2009. The proposed trial began on July 13. It saw the southbound motor-vehicle curb lane and the northbound-side sidewalk allocated to bicycles, with the southbound-side sidewalk allocated to pedestrians. The reassigned lane was separated from motor vehicles by a physical barrier. As part of the trial, traffic pattern changes to accommodate feeder bicycle traffic were also completed on Pacific St., next to the North bridgehead, over complaints from local merchants that cited lack of consultation and possible negative impacts on their businesses.\\"Burrard Bridge bike lanes make Hornby Street merchants anxious\\", Vancouver Sun, July 3, 2009.\\"Plant store owner calls Burrard Bridge bike-lane trial 'nail in the coffin'\\", Georgia Straight, July 16, 2009.

Six weeks into the trial another local merchant reported a 25% drop in sales, and a local restaurant reported a 30% drop in sales.\\"Bike trial still a bust for business\\" , Vancouver Courier, August 28, 2009. Regarding effects on three kinds of traffic: two weeks into the trial, the City of Vancouver released a data report showing daily bicycle travel across the bridge had increased by an average of 30%. The same report indicated little change in pedestrian trips, a slight drop in motor vehicle trips, but no change in motor vehicle travel times between 12th Avenue and Georgia Street along Burrard via the bridge.Burrard Bridge Lane Reallocation Trial - Statistics For a pedestrian's early review, see D. Bramham, Vancouver Sun, 14 July 2009. In July 2009 a website allowing people to register opposition to the bike lane trail was set up by local realtor and former NPA parks candidate Keith Roy at www.unblockthebridge.ca . (On August 24, 2009 the Vancouver Police Department announced a sharp increase in bicycle theft, with the first three weeks of August experiencing a 53 percent increase over 2008,\\"Vancouver seeing spike in bike thefts: police\\", CBC, August 24, 2009. however, VPD spokesperson Constable Jana McGuinness denied a link between the rise in theft and the lane reallocation trial.\\"Bike theft in Vancouver rides high cycle\\", The Globe and Mail, August 25, 2009.) By 2019, the bike lane on the Burrard Bridge had become the busiest bike lane in North America. The Downtown Business Improvement Association, which had originally opposed the conversion of vehicle lanes into bike lanes, stated that it endorsed cycling infrastructure because many employees and customers bike to downtown businesses. Electronic billboard In December, 2009 the Squamish First Nation erected an electronic billboard on their land adjacent to the south end of the bridge on the west side. It is visible to traffic travelling in both directions on the bridge and each screen (one for each direction) measures 9 metres wide x 3 metres tall. The advertisements will cycle every ten seconds. There has been controversy and protest from neighbouring residents who claim the billboard is unsightly, blocks view corridors of the mountains and even that it is a dangerous distraction to drivers.\\"Squamish First Nation installs billboard near Burrard Bridge\\", Global TV, December 3, 2009. There are at least five other similar billboards going up near the Lions Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing as well as near the Stawamus Chief on Highway 99. The billboards were approved by the federal government. Local and regional governments have acknowledged they have no control over what is done on native reserve lands. The Squamish Nation has said that the purpose of the billboards is primarily to make money.\\"Squamish First Nation installs billboard near Burrard Bridge\\", The Province, December 3, 2009. PCB contamination There continues to be a significant problem with PCB contaminants at the bridge; in 2012 Vancouver City Council allocated $14 million in funding over two years to the removal of PCB contaminants from the Burrard and Granville bridges.

They excavated three sites the Villa at Vagni, Villa at Pareti, and the Villa at San Nicola. The site at Vagni lies on an artificial terraced platform which overlooks the Cosenza-Potenza road and the Platona-Tanagro valley. Within the Villa of Vagni they found pottery which included black gaze. From the findings at Vagni it was found that the countryside around Buccino was used till the last years of the fourth century. The Villa at Pareti showed much pottery from the Lucanian which may have suggested that it was Lucanian as well. There was a major problem at the Villa at Pareti which was to features with the polygonal platform walls. The Villa at San Nicola is located below the town of Buccino and across the river from the other two sites. *Scientific excavations at Anshan in Iran begin.

The group was inspired by Georges Sorel, Charles Maurras and a selective reading of anarchist theorist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. History Founded in 1911 by national-syndicalist disciples of Georges Sorel, Georges Valois and √âdouard Berth, the group was described as \\"founded by nationalists, and initially addressed only to them\\".https://www.persee.fr/doc/mcm_1146-1225_1994_num_12_1_1108 The organisation began as informal meetings consisting of about twenty people on average, mainly monarchists and syndicalists who were associated with the right-wing monarchist group Action Fran√ßaise. The main speakers at these meetings were Valois, Berth, monarchist militant Henri Lagrange and nationalist philosopher Gilbert Mayor. French historian G√©raud Poumar√®de describes the Circle's ambition as to \\"convert trade unionists to the monarchy\\".https://www.persee.fr/doc/mcm_1146-1225_1994_num_12_1_1108 Despite the group's close association to Sorel he was initially hostile to the group stating that he feared the Circle would make \\"young people less able to understand Proudhon\\".https://www.persee.fr/doc/mcm_1146-1225_1994_num_12_1_1108 Charles Maurras was also wary of the group describing them in his book, L‚ÄôAction fran√ßaise et la religion catholique (1913): \\"The French who met to found the Circle Proudhon are all nationalists. The boss they chose for their assembly made them meet other French, who are not nationalists, who are not royalists, and who join them to participate in the life of the Circle and the writing of Cahiers. The initial group includes men of different origins, different conditions, who have no political aspirations in common, and who will freely expose their views in the Cahiers.\\" The Circle published a bulletin entitled Cahiers du Cercle Proudhon, and operated a bookstore owned by Valois named the La Nouvelle Librairie which is still open to this day.https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/une-librairie-d-extreme-droite- a-l-assaut-du-quartier-latin_2034002.html Ideology right The first issue of Cahiers du cercle Proudhon appeared in January - February 1912 and included a D√©claration: Berth and Valois had been brought together by Georges Sorel when he was planning a Nationalist and socialist-leaning journal La Cit√© fran√ßaise in 1910. This journal never appeared, except as heralded in a flyer entitled D√©claration de la Cit√© francaise signed by Sorel, Valois, Berth, Jean Variot, and Pierre Gilbert. However Variot quarrelled with Valois and went on to publish material with Sorel's support in L'Ind√©pendence. A controversial but influential book by Zeev Sternhell, Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France, points to the Cercle Proudhon as a pre-existing laboratory for fascist ideas that would provide a bulwark for Nazi collaboration in Vichy. Critique Many anarchists rejected the Cercle Proudhon interpretation of Proudhon's works. For example, Russian anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin argued that Cercle Proudhon purposely misrepresented Proudhon's views, See also * National syndicalism * Action Fran√ßaise References * Allen Douglas.

For the Caesar (335-337) Flavius Dalmatius, son of the censor, see Dalmatius. Flavius Dalmatius (died 337), also known as Dalmatius the Censor, was a censor (333), and a member of the Constantinian dynasty, which ruled over the Roman Empire at the beginning of the 4th century. Dalmatius was the son of Constantius Chlorus and Flavia Maximiana Theodora, and thus half-brother of the Emperor Constantine I. Dalmatius spent his youth in the Gallic Tolosa. It is probable that his two sons, Dalmatius and Hannibalianus, were born here. During the mid-320s, Flavius Dalmatius returned to Constantinople, to the court of his half- brother, and was appointed consul and censor in 333. In Antioch, Flavius was responsible for the security of the eastern borders of the realm. During this period, he examined the case of bishop Athanasius of Alexandria, an important opponent of Arianism, who was accused of murder. In 334, Flavius suppressed the revolt of Calocaerus, who had proclaimed himself emperor in Cyprus. In the following year he sent some soldiers to the council of Tyros to save the life of Athanasius. His two sons were appointed to important offices under Constantine's administration, but Flavius Dalmatius and his sons were killed in the purges that followed the Emperor's death in May 337.

The place was formerly known as Vaypura / Vadaparappanad and also as Beydary. Tippu Sultan, ruler of Mysore, named the town \\"Sultan Pattanam\\". There is a marina and a beach while Beypore port is one of the oldest ports in Kerala, which historically traded with the Middle East. Beypore is noted for building wooden ships, known as dhows or urus in the Malayalam language. These ships were usually bought by Arab merchants for trading and fishing but are now used as tourist ships. According to Captain Iwata, founder member of the Association of Sumerian ships in Japan, Sumerian ships might have been built in Beypore. There is evidence to prove that Beypore had direct trade links with Mesopotamia and was a prominent link on the maritime silk route. History Beypore was ruled by four Kovilakams - Karippa Puthiyakovilakam, Manayat Kovilakam, Nediyaal Kovilakam and Panagad Kovilakam. As the Gazetteers explain, the Beypore amsam itself had four Kovilakams called - Manayatt kovilakam, Nediyal kovilakom, Puthiya kovilakom and the Panangat kovilakom belonging to the family of the Beypore branch of the Parappanad family. So we have North and South Parappanad factions to start with, branching off the Parappur lordship. The North faction was further split into Beypore, Cheruvannor and Panniyankara Kovilakoms. Considering that Ravi Varma and his brother mentioned Beypore and the specific Manayyat location, let us for a moment assume Raja Ravi Varma hailed from the forerunners of the present Manayyat kovilakom. Raja Raja Varma in his diary states - Near this ‚ÄòBeypore‚Äô Kovilakam or house is a temple of Vettakaruman or the Hunter God which it is said and acknowledged by its present owners, the Manayam Rajahs, once belonged to us of the Tattari Kovilakam house, by which our family was known. Based on all the above, I would assume that the original Parappanad rajas named their home the Tattari Kovilakom. It is from this home, which incidentally is further linked to the Kolathunad Rajas (Kolathiris) that various rulers (such as Marthanda Varma) and consorts as well as adoptees to the Travancore kingdom originated. Of course as we see, the ruling king usually reserved the right on the name raja and took affront to another cousin using the title while a raja was in power and complained, but then again, Ravi Varma in reality had some self-projection in mind, as we note. Now let us study the relations between the Parappanad Kovilakoms and the Travancore royal family to see where and how Ravi Varma fits in. It is believed that the Beypore Siva Temple protects the whole kingdom. Beypore was visited first by Romans and afterwards by Chinese, Syrians, Arabs and in recent centuries by Europeans for trade. Beypore has long history of being a centre for shipbuilding since the first century AD, and it was further expanded under the East India Company during the early nineteenth century. The Indian Ocean trade started from ancient times and strengthened during the medieval times. While in the old days Malabar directly traded with the Greeks and Romans, it concentrated on exchanges with the Middle Eastern ports in the medieval times. This exchange of goods resulted also in transfer of people from their abodes. While it is mentioned that Malabari‚Äôs were found along African ports and even Egypt‚Äôs, it was mostly Arabs who migrated to the Malabar coasts, mainly to administer, control and conduct the trade with their brethren in Yemen, Basra and Egyptian ports. Beypore was virtually free port with only an export import duty imposed by the ruling Zamorins. The intermediaries between the Arabs and the Nairs were the Moplah‚Äôs (themselves a community started by the intermingling Arab men and local women from ancient times). Also the south east Malay ports sent ships to Malabar for the cloth from Kerala, until British cloth took its place later in the 19th century. It was also a stop over for Hajj pilgrims from south east Asia. The Arab settlers in Malabar even had African slaves during that period. The internationally well known Tasara Creative Weaving Centre which attracts textile artists and designers from all over the world is situated in North Beypore which is just one Km away from the Boat building yard. Beypore was known as Beydhaalhee in neighboring Maldives. Maldivian national hero Muhammad Thakurufan learnt martial art and did his religious studies in Beypore. Beypore Port Beypore is world-famous for the ancient design boats called Urus Beypore port is a Sub-port of Kozhikode port and is situated approximately 10 km south of Kozhikode. The land for the port was acquired from Beypore Karippa Puthiyakovilakam in the year 1963-64. It is an estuarine port, where Beypore river discharges into the Arabian Sea. Beypore is 180 km North of Cochin and 391 km away from Trivandrum. Beypore port is the second biggest port in Kerala after Cochin and currently handles about 100,000 tonnes of cargo and 7500 passengers per annum. The nearest ports are Kochi and Mangalore. Now the port has a depth of about 5 meters alongside wharf and approach channel and it is proposed to be developed in stages and utilities like storage shed, cranes and tugs are already installed. Beypore port is one of the oldest ports in Kerala from where trading was done to the Middle East.  Uru Building  Beypore has a reputation for boat building The Uru (boat), or \\"Fat Boat\\", is a generic name for large Dhow-type wooden ships made by vishwabrahmins in Beypore. This type of boat has been used by the Arabs since ancient times as trading vessels, and even now, urus are being manufactured and exported to Arab nations from Beypore. These boats used to be built of several types of wood, the main one being teak. The teak was taken from Nilambur forests in earlier times, but now imported Malaysian teak is used.https://www.facebook.com/238044912896496/videos/1454648004569508 Geography Beypore is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Beypore It has an average elevation of 1 metre (3 feet).

These include nutrient deficiency disorders, diseases with prolonged fever and infection, malignant diseases, parasitic infections that can result from contamination, anorexia nervosa and other conditions. The malnourishment associated with emaciation has been referred to as \\"inanition\\", while infection by parasites has been described as \\"adulteration\\". Treatment of emaciation includes gradual renourishment with a slow increase of daily caloric intake to help rebuild tissues and regain weight. Rest, and emotional and psychological therapy and support may be included. Characteristics In humans, the overall physical appearance of emaciation includes a thinning of the limbs, upper body and buttocks to an almost skeletal-seeming state with an apparent absence of fat and muscle tone. The skin is thin, dry and translucent in some areas of the body, to the point that veins beneath the skin are somewhat visible. The face is thin and drawn with a hopeless, vacant and distressed demeanor; the eye sockets are sunken, giving the eyes a bulging appearance. The scalp is bony with dry, withering hair that is lacking. On the torso, the collar bone, chest bone and ribs are quite pronounced; the stomach is bloated, which indicates gastrointestinal distress associated with nutritional depletion. The mouth and tongue may be excessively dry, or moist with the tongue thickly coated; there is usually strong halitosis, or foul breath. There is great fatigue, inability and lack of physical effort in the emaciated. Mental efficiency, problem solving and reasoning are somewhat impaired. The emotional state of an emaciated individual is often poor; feelings of depression, hopelessness, fear, anxiety and worthlessness may prevail. The underlying starvation, malnourishment, and usually dehydration, associated with emaciation, affect and are harmful to organ systems throughout the body. The emaciated individual experiences disturbances of the blood, circulatory, and urinary systems; these include hyponatremia and/or hypokalemia (low sodium and/or potassium in the blood, respectively), anemia (low hemoglobin), improper function of lymph (immune system-related white blood matter) and the lymphatic system, and pleurisy (fluid in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs) and edema (swelling in general) caused by poor or improper function of the kidneys to eliminate wastes from the blood.

Buchenwald inmates, 16 April 1945 when camp was liberated In most of Africa, poverty, malnutrition and disease are common. Among third world countries, India is one of the leading countries plagued by malnutrition, with more than 200 million people affected. Emaciation in India is referred to as \\"shosha roga\\", which means \\"exploitative disease\\". Diseases such as these are nutrient deficiency disorders that can cause varying degrees of emaciation based on the type of nutrient(s) chronically and persistently lacking or absent from the diet of an individual. Emaciation was also a major cause of death in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. It was largely the result of a starvation diet imposed on the inmates. It became endemic during the last stages of the war when rations were restricted even further. It can also occur if a prisoner, often for a political cause or in plead of innocence, refuses food on a hunger strike or is forcibly fed but unable to retain the fluids or maintain nutrition. Restrictive diets can lead to significant weight loss, as can psychological problems, depression and social problems and issues. Anorexia nervosa is the psychological disease of a denial of weight loss and thinness while maintaining the same physical activity; Certain digestive diseases can induce weight loss. Diseases often associated with weight loss include tuberculosis, HIV infection, endocarditis or chronic inflammatory disease with febrile vasculitis, Behcet's disease, connective, Still's disease, sarcoidosis, and certain cancers or blood diseases. Some neurological diseases such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease may also cause significant weight loss. Poisoning such as chronic alcoholism, drug addiction or taking drugs by mistake are also common causes. Taking too much medication is a possible cause of weight loss in the elderly and weak, if the medication suppresses appetite. Famine and third world conditions are usually involved. Severe emaciation can be caused by marasmus, a disorder that is seen in children who are deprived of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Both weight and growth are affected. A similar disorder, seen in very young malnourished children, is kwashiorkor. With emaciation mostly confined to the upper body, kwashiorkor often occurs after a child has been weaned and thus deprived of protein it was getting from its mother's milk. Slight emaciation is seen with nutrition disorders such as beriberi, caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1), and pellagra, caused by insufficient intake of niacin (vitamin B3). The former is mainly characterized by mental impairment, and the latter is more serious, often leading to death. Other diseases and disorders associated with emaciation include malaria and cholera, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases with prolonged fever, parasitic infections, many forms of cancer and their treatments, lead poisoning, and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa. Treatment Other than treating, curing or remedying the underlying cause of emaciation, it as a symptom is treated by regaining the weight and restoring the tissues. This is done through renourishment, or reintroducing nourishing liquids and foods to the body while increasing the intake of food energy. The process, usually begun in an individual deprived of food for a period of time, must be done slowly to avoid complications such as regurgitation, vomiting, and refeeding syndrome. It begins with spoonfuls of water and salted broth, advancing to increased amounts of clear liquids including broth, tea and fruit juices. This soon is advanced to full liquid diet such as milk (if no lactose intolerance is present) and cream-based soups. Once solid food is introduced, an emaciated individual is usually given up to eight small meals per day, at two-hour intervals. Meals may consist of a small milkshake to minor portions of meat with a starchy side item. For the purposes of weight gain and tissue rebuilding, the diet will be focused on proteins, fats and carbohydrates that are rich in vitamins and minerals, and relatively high in energy. Oily foods and high-fiber foods like grains and certain vegetables are discouraged because they are difficult to digest, and filling while lower in energy. Treatment of emaciation also includes much sleep, rest and relaxation, and counseling. Animals Illustration of an emaciated horse, by Chinese artist Gong Kai The appearance and effects of emaciation in animals, both wild and domestic, is like that of humans-severe thinness, loss of fat and muscle, extremely pronounced and protruding bones, and weakness. Starvation and regularly dehydration, brought on by neglect and cruelty from humans, or as a result of illness are the usual causes of emaciation in domestic animals like dogs, cats and horses; in wild animals, starvation with emaciation is caused by unavailable sources of food, loss or changes of habitat, or neglect in captivity. The rehabilitation of emaciated animals, through treating their starvation and dehydration with slow renourishment, can be challenging. The unique and specific physiological and dietary needs of animals, be they mammals, birds, reptiles, carnivores, herbivores, etc. are carefully considered to avoid causing harm.

Procopius calls him \\"Hellestheaeus\\", a variant of version of his regnal name,  æ∆éll√§  æA·π£b…ô·∏•a (Histories, 1.20). Variants of his name are Hellesthaeus, Ellestheaeus, Eleshaah, Ellesboas, and Elesboam. At Aksum, in inscription RIE 191, his name is rendered in unvocalized G…ô‚Äò…ôz as KLB ‚ÄôL ‚Äô·π¢B·∏§ WLD TZN (Kaleb  æElla  æA·π£be·∏•a, son of Tazena). In vocalized G…ô‚Äò…ôz, it is (Kaleb  æ∆éll√§  æA·π£b…ô·∏•a). Kaleb, a name derived from the Biblical character Caleb, is his given name; on both his coins and inscriptions he left at Axum, as well as Ethiopian hagiographical sources and king lists, he refers to himself as the son of Tazena.S. C. Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity (Edinburgh: University Press, 1991), p. 84. History Procopius, John of Ephesus, and other contemporary historians recount Kaleb's invasion of Yemen around 520, against the Himyarite king, Yusuf Asar Yathar, known as Dhu Nuwas, a Jew who was persecuting the Christian community of Najran. After much fighting, Kaleb's soldiers eventually routed Yusuf's forces and killed the king, allowing Kaleb to appoint Sumuafa' Ashawa', a native Christian (named Esimiphaios by Procopius), as his viceroy of Himyar. As a result of his protection of the Christians, Kaleb is known as Saint Elesbaan after the sixteenth-century Cardinal Caesar Baronius added him to his edition of the Roman Martyrology despite his being a miaphysite. However, the question of whether Miaphysitism‚Äîthe actual Christology of Oriental Orthodoxy, including the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria)‚Äîwas a heresy is a question which remains to this day. A reference map of the empire of Kaleb of Axum. Axumite control of Arabia Felix continued until c. 525 when Sumuafa' Ashawa' was deposed by Abraha, who made himself king. Procopius states that Kaleb made several unsuccessful attempts to recover his overseas territory; however, his successor later negotiated a peace with Abraha, where Abraha acknowledged the Axumite king's authority and paid tribute. Munro-Hay opines that by this expedition Axum overextended itself, and this final intervention across the Red Sea, \\"was Aksum's swan-song as a great power in the region.\\"Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 88. A historical record survives of a meeting between the Byzantine ambassador and historian Nonnosus and Kaleb in the year 530.Bowersock, G.W, The Throne of Adulis: Red Sea Wars on the Eve of Islam (2013), p. 109 Ethiopian tradition states that Kaleb eventually abdicated his throne, gave his crown to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and retired to a monastery.Munro-Hay, Aksum, pp. 88f. Later historians who recount the events of King Kaleb's reign include ibn Hisham, ibn Ishaq, and al-Tabari. Taddesse Tamrat records a tradition he heard from an aged priest in Lalibela that \\"Kaleb was a man of Lasta and his palace was at Bugna where it is known that Gebre Mesqel Lalibela had later established his centre. The relevance of this tradition for us is the mere association of the name of Kaleb with the evangelization of this interior province of Aksum.\\"The translation of one inscription, written in Ge Ωez, appears with discussion in George Wynn Brereton Huntingford, The Historical Geography of Ethiopia (London: The British Academy, 1989), pp. 63-65. Besides several inscriptions bearing his name,Taddesse Tamrat, Church and State in Ethiopia (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 26 n. 1 Axum also contains a pair of ruined structures, one said to be his tomb and its partner said to be the tomb of his son, Gabra Masqal. (Tradition gives him a second son, Israel, whom it has been suggested is identical with king Israel of Axum.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 91.) This structure was first examined as an archaeological subject by Henry Salt in the early 19th century; almost a century later, it was partially cleared and mapped out by the Deutsche Aksum-Expedition in 1906. The most recent excavation of this tomb was in 1973 by the British Institute in Eastern Africa.The report of the 1973 excavation of these structures was published in S.C. Munro-Hay, Excavations at Aksum (London: British Institute in Eastern Africa, 1989), pp. 42ff.

United States, 242 U.S. 470 (1917), was a United States Supreme Court case involving Farley Drew Caminetti and the Mann Act. The Court decided that the Mann Act applied not only to purposes of prostitution but also to other noncommercial consensual sexual liaisons. Thus, consensual extramarital sex falls within the definition of \\"immoral sex.\\" Plain meaning rule The case has a historic place in American jurisprudence in that it was one of the first where the court embraced the idea of the ‚Äúplain meaning rule‚Äù. This is a form of legislative interpretation that focuses strongly on the literal text of a statute. In its most extreme form the plain meaning rule does not look outside of the statutory text at any additional sources to find the legislative intent if the rule is \\"plain\\" from the text. Critics of using the plain meaning rule argue that a court may find or not find an ambiguity in a statute depending on the end result that a court sees fit. The issue in the case that caused the Court to interpret using the plain meaning rule was whether the Mann Act's inclusion of the phrase ‚Äú...or for any other immoral purpose...‚Äù included Caminetti's actions. The Court found that Caminetti had been convicted of transporting a woman across state lines for an immoral purpose which, according to the majority opinion, was well within the plain meaning of the statute.

It is officially operated by the California Desert Studies Consortium, a consortium of 7 CSU campuses: Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Northridge, San Bernardino and Cal Poly Pomona. Before the Center, the site was the Zzyzx Mineral Springs and Health Spa, run by Curtis Howe Springer from 1944 to 1974 without federal permission. After Springer was ejected, the CSU negotiated usage of the abandoned buildings of the health spa with the Bureau of Land Management, and in 1976, they signed a five-year cooperative management study for the Desert Studies Consortium to manage at Soda Springs. The consortium continues to manage the site. The location is especially interesting to biologists because of the many unique species of animals and plants in the area, including the Saratoga Springs pupfish, the Mohave tui chub, and over 200 species of birds. The center has a 10,000-watt solar panel array.

After recording a demo, the band signed with the independent label Goodfellow Records in 2000 and released The Burial Plot Bidding War EP. The band signed to Ferret Music in mid-2000 and was planning to record its first album later in the year. After writing was completed in December of that year, the band went on several US tours until March 2001. In March and April, Last Night in Town was recorded with the Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz at Zing Studios in Westfield, Massachusetts. Following recording, the band went on tour with Killswitch Engage and Santa Sangre. Last Night in Town was first released on August 14, 2001. The album received positive reviews with critics praising the band's chaotic sound showcased on the album. It was reissued in June 2004 with new artwork. It was pressed on vinyl by Suburban Home Records in December 2006 as part of a box with Hot Damn! (2003) and Gutter Phenomenon (2005). Background Every Time I Die was formed in 1998 by two brothers, the vocalist Keith Buckley and the guitarist Jordan Buckley. They brought in the guitarist Andy Williams and the drummer Michael \\"Ratboy\\" Novack. With a session musician on bass guitar, the band recorded a demo. With John McCarthy on bass guitar, the band toured across North America. With Aaron Ratajczak on bass guitar, the band signed with the independent label Goodfellow Records and released the EP The Burial Plot Bidding War in 2000.Sharpe-Young 2005, p. 135 The band subsequently toured heavily across the east coast and Midwest. On July 10, it was announced that the band had signed with Ferret Music and would record its first album at the end of the summer or early fall, aiming for its release in the fall. Two days later, the band revealed that the album would be titled Last Night in Town. On December 5, the band was planning to record Last Night in Town in February 2001, aiming for its release in the spring. On December 22, it was announced that the band had finished writing for Last Night in Town and that recording would take place in either February or March 2001. In December 2000 and January 2001, the band toured with Eighteen Visions. Following this, the band went on tour with Killswitch Engage. From early to mid-March, the band went on a short US tour with Premonitions of War. Production and composition On March 21, the band began recording Last Night in Town with the producer Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage. Recording took place at Zing Studios in Westfield, Massachusetts. On April 12, it was announced that recording was finished. On April 21 and 22, the group returned to the studio to mix the album. Buckley said the album was \\"a chronological order of riffs that we wrote\\".ExclaimTV 2013, 3:22‚Äì25 Chris Gramlich of Exclaim! said the album was \\"conceptually darker\\" than The Burial Plot Bidding War, and said it was \\"lyrically and artistically, laced with black-humour, technical excursions, metallic breaks, [and] intertwining and eclectic guitar work\\". Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic says the album showcases the band \\"careening from metalcore crunch to exhausting screamo and even meandering into slightly emotional melodic singing\\" to the likes of Glassjaw. Mustapha Mond of Lambgoat said the album had a \\"darker, sludgier metal sound.\\" Release In July and August, the band toured with Killswitch Engage and Santa Sangre. After being planned for release in July, Last Night in Town was released on August 14 through Ferret Music. Chris Gramlich of Exclaim! called the artwork \\"striking\\" and it said it showed the band \\"decked out Reservoir Dogs-style, beating the tar out of some poor jerk\\". Buckley said it was \\"really dark, [and] really sarcastic\\". A music video was released for \\"The Logic of Crocodiles\\", which featured the wrestler Matt Cross. Reception and aftermath The AllMusic reviewer Jason D. Taylor called the album \\"a cathartic, chaotic release\\", and continued, \\"The listener will go from being stunned to outright jaw-dropping incredulity.\\" He said that the record was very comparable to Drowningman in the regard that both bands are able to \\"flawlessly twist your mind into a pretzel and then straighten it back out with the occasional melody\\". Taylor concluded his review by saying that the \\"reluctance to remove the album from your stereo is surely proof enough that this is one of the most potentially amazing bands inhabiting the metalcore scene\\". Mustapha Mond of Lambgoat said the album was \\"as peppy as tough, crazy hardcore can get. And on top of the boots-rocking beat, ETID layers breakdown after breakdown\\". He said it \\"keeps up the rocking for ten powerful tracks, and manages to put enough artistry into them that any one, listened to alone, will knock your socks off\\". In a review for Punknews, Brian Shultz said the album brought \\"the terms \\"rhetoric\\" and \\"caustic\\" each to a whole new level. He noted that the band \\"stray from choruses like they were acting out magnetism laws\\" and praised Buckley's \\"penetrating screams and joyously wild yells\\". He mentioned that the guitars \\"flip-flop between frenetic riffing and hyperactive decrescendos. ... it's metalcore that does not let the fuck up\\". Last Night in Town was re-released on June 21, 2004, with new artwork. The album was reissued on vinyl as part of a box set along with Hot Damn! (2003) and Gutter Phenomenon (2005). The box set was released on December 12, 2006, by the independent label Suburban Home Records. In 2010, Buckley said he re-listened to the album and said, \\"It's hard to play, I don't know how I even wrote some of that stuff.\\"Thrash Hits 2010, 1:27‚Äì31 In 2013, he said the album was \\"just 50 riffs and none of them repeat and it's almost like, what were we thinking?\\".ExclaimTV 2013, 3:31‚Äì36 Jim Smallman of TeamRock ranked Last Night in Town as his least favorite Every Time I Die album, calling it \\"A fine debut, but the band were to head on to better things.\\"  Track listing  Personnel  * Jordan Buckley ‚Äì guitar * Keith Buckley ‚Äì vocals * Andrew Williams ‚Äì guitar * Michael \\"Ratboy\\" Novak Jr. ‚Äì drums * Aaron Ratajczak ‚Äì bass guitar, piano on \\"Nothing Dreadful Ever Happens\\" * Howard Jones ‚Äì backing vocals on \\"Punch-Drunk Punk Rock Romance\\"  References  Citations Sources  * * Category:Every Time I Die albums Category:2001 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Adam Dutkiewicz Category:Ferret Music albums ","title":"Last Night in Town"},{"id":"2281082","text":"The plain meaning rule, also known as the literal rule, is one of three rules of statutory construction traditionally applied by English courts.\\"The notion has long prevailed that three different rules or approaches may be employed in ascertaining the meaning of a statute. First, there is said to be the \\"purpose\\" approach or \\"mischief rule\\"....Then there is said to be the \\"literal\\" approach or \\"plain meaning\\" rule....Finally there is what is called the \\"golden rule\\".... Source: Elmer Driedger, Construction of Statutes. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 1. The other two are the \\"mischief rule\\" and the \\"golden rule\\". The plain meaning rule dictates that statutes are to be interpreted using the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute. In other words, a statute is to be read word for word and is to be interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the language, unless a statute explicitly defines some of its terms otherwise or unless the result would be cruel or absurd. Ordinary words are given their ordinary meaning, technical terms are given their technical meaning, and local, cultural terms are recognized as applicable. The plain meaning rule is the mechanism that prevents courts from taking sides in legislative or political issues. Additionally, it is the mechanism that underlies textualism and, to a certain extent, originalism.  Meaning  To avoid ambiguity, legislatures often include \\"definitions\\" sections within a statute, which explicitly define the most important terms used in that statute.See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1531(b) (defining \\"partial-birth abortion\\" as comprehended by the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003). But some statutes omit a definitions section entirely, or (more commonly) fail to define a particular term. The plain meaning rule attempts to guide courts faced with litigation that turns on the meaning of a term not defined by the statute, or on that of a word found within a definition itself. According to the plain meaning rule, absent a contrary definition within the statute, words must be given their plain, ordinary and literal meaning. If the words are clear, they must be applied, even though the intention of the legislator may have been different or the result is harsh or undesirable. The literal rule is what the law says instead of what the law was intended to say. Larry Solum, Professor of Law at Georgetown University, expands on this premise: = Soft plain meaning rule = Justices normally impose an absurdity limit on this rule, which states that a statute cannot be interpreted literally if it would lead to an absurd result. In the US Supreme Court Chung Fook v. White (1924) marked the beginning of the looser American Rule that the intent of the law was more important than its text. This is sometimes termed the soft plain meaning rule, where the statute is interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the language, unless the result would be cruel or absurd. For example, see Rector, Holy Trinity Church v. United States, 143 U.S. 457 (1892). Even the most vocal supporters of textualism and the plain meaning rule have been willing to commute \\"strict\\" plain meaning to \\"soft\\" plain meaning to a certain extent, in some circumstances; see, e.g. United States v. X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. 64 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting): In the United Kingdom, this is referred to as the golden rule.  Reasons favored  Proponents of the plain meaning rule claim that it prevents courts from taking sides in legislative or political issues. They also point out that ordinary people and lawyers do not have extensive access to secondary sources. In probate law the rule is also favored because the testator is typically not around to indicate what interpretation of a will is appropriate. Therefore, it is argued, extrinsic evidence should not be allowed to vary the words used by the testator or their meaning. It can help to provide for consistency in interpretation.  Criticism  This is the oldest of the rules of construction and is still used today, primarily because judges may not legislate. As there is always the danger that a particular interpretation may be the equivalent of making law, some judges prefer to adhere to the law's literal wording. Opponents of the plain meaning rule claim that the rule rests on the erroneous assumption that words have a fixed meaning. In fact, words are imprecise, leading justices to impose their own prejudices to determine the meaning of a statute. However, since little else is offered as an alternative discretion-confining theory, plain meaning survives. =Doctrine of absurdity = In law, strictly literal interpretations of statutes can lead to seemingly absurd results. The doctrine of absurdity holds that commonsense interpretations should be preferred in such cases, rather than literal readings. Under the absurdity doctrine, American courts have interpreted statutes contrary to their plain meaning in order to avoid absurd legal conclusions.The Absurdity Doctrine, Harvard Law Review, John F. Manning, Vol.116, #8, June, 2003, pp. 2387-2486, It is contrasted with literalism.  English law history  An explanation of the rule was given in the Sussex Peerage Case (1844; 11 Cl&Fin; 85). \\"The only rule for construction of Acts of Parliament is that they should be construed according to the intent of the Parliament which passed the Act. If the words of the Statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in that natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do, in such a case, best declare the intention of the law giver.\\" However, use of the literal rule may defeat the intention of Parliament. For instance, in the case of Whiteley v. Chappel,Whiteley v. Chappel (1868; LR 4 QB 147) the court came to the reluctant conclusion that Whiteley could not be convicted of impersonating \\"any person entitled to vote\\" at an election, because the person he impersonated was dead. Using a literal construction of the relevant statutory provision, the deceased was not \\"a person entitled to vote\\". This, surely, cannot have been the intention of Parliament. However, the literal rule does not take into account the consequences of a literal interpretation, only whether words have a clear meaning that makes sense within that context. If Parliament does not like the literal interpretation, then it must amend the legislation. Other uses The \\"plain meaning rule\\" has sometimes been applied to the interpretation of contracts, particularly in conjunction with the parol evidence rule. Such a use is controversial.

White, 264 U.S. 443 (1924), was a Supreme Court case. In line with the plain meaning rule, the Court determined that a native-born citizen of the United States was not automatically entitled to rights granted by a statute for naturalized citizens, despite the doctrine of absurdity. The proviso of ¬ß 22 of the Immigration Act of 1917 allowed for the wife of a \\"naturalized\\" citizen (who married his wife after the naturalization) to be brought over to the United States. It was argued that Chung Fook, a native- born citizen, would then be allowed to bring over his wife, as it would not make sense to gave a particular right to a naturalized citizen that a native- born citizen was not permitted. The Court rejected this argument and wrote \\"The words of the statute being clear, if it unjustly discriminates against the native-born citizen, or is cruel and inhuman in its results, as forcefully contended, the remedy lies with Congress, and not with the courts. Their duty is simply to enforce the law as it is written, unless clearly unconstitutional.\\" The Court opinion was delivered by Justice Sutherland.

History Within two months of existence these four death metal enthusiasts recorded a death metal demo featuring one of the most low-pitched and cavernous voices ever heard in death metal. A Dutch independent label, Foundation 2000, signed them for one album. Before recording Mindloss they first released another demo in 1990, which also received positive feedback. As a supporting act for Carcass they travelled through Belgium and the Netherlands impressing the metal-scene also on stage. Colin Richardson was the producer of 1991's album Mindloss. Before they toured with Revenant from New Jersey, guitarist Alex van Schaik was replaced by Boudewijn Bonebakker. Not satisfied with Foundation 2000, Gorefest signed a contract in 1992 with Nuclear Blast. Hoogendoorn quit because of incidents during the Mindloss-tour and drummer Ed Warby (who came from melodic band called Elegy) took his place just two weeks before recording sessions of False which was also produced by Colin Richardson. The album sold relatively well in the Netherlands and Germany for a band of the genre. In the months to come they completed a European tour with Deicide and Atrocity, playing in Germany, Sweden, Spain, Czech Republic, Slovakia and England. In 1993, Gorefest played a show at the Dynamo Open Air at Eindhoven. The Eindhoven Insanity was released soon thereafter, featuring this performance. Also in 1993, they toured North America as a supporting act for metal band Death. Their Insanity Tour closed with a show in Mexico City, Mexico. Erase was recorded in 1994, with producer Pete Coleman and revealed a more mature Gorefest with a different attitude towards traditional death metal. As a result, public opinion towards Gorefest was divided. Erase, however, proved to be a success as international sales went well through 1994 and 1995. The band reached a broader set of countries in the following tours. =Rupture with the past= In the Fear EP and \\"Freedom\\" single, Gorefest revealed new tracks showing that they wanted to drastically expand upon the musical changes they had applied in Erase (De Koeijer declared in some interviews that he even had thoughts about taking singing lessons). This would be confirmed in 1996 with a rockish Soul Survivor ‚Äì a total departure from their roots even showing traces of pop ‚Äì and a very similar Chapter 13 in 1998. They even abandoned their heavy image and the graphics for these works were less extreme. Inexorably, fans turned their backs on them and the sales of the album were a relative fiasco, thus they split up in 1998. =Comeback= Gorefest reformed in 2004 and played various summer festivals in 2005. The band then came out with a new album, La Muerte. They produced the album themselves, with mixing by Tue Madsen from Antfarm Studios. In 2006, De Koeyer appeared at EPICA's concert in Paradiso (Amsterdam) as a guest grunter on the song \\"Consign to Oblivion\\"(A New Age Dawns #3). The next album, Rise to Ruin was released in August 2007. The American release was licensed to Candlelight Records. On 15 June 2009 the band announced that they were calling it quits again, stating that they felt they had gone as far with the band as they could.

A globster is distinguished from a normal beached carcass by being hard to identify, at least by initial untrained observers, and by creating controversy as to its identity. History The term \\"globster\\" was coined by Ivan T. Sanderson in 1962 to describe the Tasmanian carcass of 1960, which was said to have \\"no visible eyes, no defined head, and no apparent bone structure.\\" Other sources simply use the term \\"blob\\". Many globsters have initially been described as gigantic octopuses, though they later turned out to be decayed carcasses of whales or large sharks. As with the \\"Chilean Blob\\" of 2003, many are masses of whale blubber released from decaying whale corpses. Others initially thought to be dead plesiosaurs later turned out to be the decayed carcasses of basking sharks. Others remain unexplained. Giant and colossal squid may also explain some globsters, particularly those tentatively identified as monster octopuses. Some globsters were examined only after they had decomposed too much and seemed to represent evidence of a new species, or were destroyed‚Äîas happened with the \\"Cadborosaurus willsi\\" carcass, found in 1937.Bousfield, Edward L. & Leblond Paul H. (2000). Cadborosaurus: Survivor from the Deep. Heritage House Publishing. However, Canadian scientists did analyse the DNA of the Newfoundland Blob‚Äîwhich revealed that the tissue was from a sperm whale. In their resulting paper, the authors point out a number of superficial similarities between the Newfoundland Blob and other globsters, concluding a similar origin for those globsters is likely.Carr, S.M., H.D.

Together with Pseudo-Zoroaster and Pseudo- Hystaspes, Ostanes belongs to the group of pseudepigraphical \\"Hellenistic Magians\\", that is, a long line of Greek and other Hellenistic writers who wrote under the name of famous \\"Magians\\". While Pseudo-Zoroaster was identified as the \\"inventor\\" of astrology, and Pseudo-Hystaspes was stereotyped as an apocalyptic prophet, Ostanes was imagined to be a master sorcerer. Real Ostanes? Unlike \\"Zoroaster\\" and \\"Hystaspes\\", which have well attested Iranian language counterparts, for \\"Ostanes\\" there is \\"no evidence of a figure of a similar name in Iranian tradition.\\".cf. . In the Encyclopedia Iranica entry for Ostanes, Morton Smith cites Justi's Namensbuch for instances of the name which refer to real persons. Smith: \\"Which [of these references to] Ostanes (...), if any, gave rise to the legend of the magus is uncertain.\\" Smith goes on to reconstruct the Old Iranian name as *(H)u≈°tƒÅna. The Justi entries that Smith alludes to are: Diodorus 17.5.5 and Plutarch Artax. 1.1.5 (cit. Ktesias) for ·ΩàœÉœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ as the name of one of the sons of Darius Nothos, and a mention in Arrian (An. 4.22) of a certain Œë·ΩêœÉœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ of Paraetakene, north-east of Bactria, who was captured by Alexander's general Krateros and then taken to India. Arrian's Œë·ΩêœÉœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ is Haustanes in Curtius 8.5. Ktesias names 'ŒÜœÅœÑœåœÉœÑŒ∑œÇ' as the son of Darius Nothus, and Justi suggests that Plutarch confused Artostes as Ostanes. Pseudo-Ostanes The origins of the figure of \\"Ostanes\\", or rather, who the Greeks imagined him to be, lies within the framework of \\"alien wisdom\\" that the Greeks (and later Romans) ascribed to famous foreigners, many of whom were famous to the Greeks even before being co-opted as authors of arcana. One of these names was that of (pseudo-)Zoroaster, whom the Greeks perceived to be the founder of the magi and of their magical arts. Another name was that of (pseudo-) Hystaspes, Zoroaster's patron. The third of les Mages hell√©nis√©s was Ostanes, imaginatively described by the 4th century BCE Hermodorus (apud Diogenes La√´rtius Prooemium 2) as being a magus in the long line of magi descending from Zoroaster. Once the magi had been associated with \\"magic\\"--Greek magikos --it was but a natural progression that the Greek's image of Zoroaster would metamorphose into a magician too.. The 1st century CE Pliny the Elder names \\"Zoroaster\\" as the inventor of magic (Natural History XXX.2.3), but a \\"principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds. That dubious honor went to another fabulous magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed.\\" Thus, while \\"universal consensus\\"--so the skeptical Pliny--was that magic began with (pseudo-)Zoroaster (xxx.2.3), as far as Pliny says he could determine, \\"Ostanes\\" was the first extant writer of it (xxx.2.8). This 'Ostanes', so Pliny states, was a Persian magus who had accompanied Xerxes in his invasion of Greece, and who had then introduced magicis, the \\"most fraudulent of the arts\\", to that country. But the figure of Ostanes was such that Pliny felt \\"it necessary to supplement his history with doppelgangers\\"; so, not only does Ostanes appear as a contemporary of the early 5th century BCE Xerxes, but he is also contemporary with--and companion of--the late 4th century BCE Alexander.. Pliny goes on to note that Ostanes's introduction of the \\"monstrous craft\\" to the Greeks gave those people not only a \\"lust\\" (aviditatem) for magic, but a downright \\"madness\\" (rabiem) for it, and many of their philosophers, such as Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato traveled abroad to study it, and then returned to teach it.(xxx.2.8-10)... Pliny also transmits Ostanes's definition of magic: \\"As Ostanes said, there are several different kinds of it; he professes to divine (divina promittit) from water, globes, air, stars, lamps, basins and axes, and by many other methods, and besides to converse with ghosts and those in the underworld\\" (xxx.2.8-10).. By the end of the 1st century CE, \\"Ostanes\\" is cited as an authority on alchemy, necromancy, divination, and on the mystical properties of plants and stones.. Both his legend and literary output attributed to him increased with time, and by the 4th century \\"he had become one of the great authorities in alchemy\\" and \\"much medieval alchemical material circulated under his name.\\". This \\"authority\\" continued in Arabic and Persian alchemical literature, such as an Arabic treatise titled Kitab al-Fusul al-ithnay ‚Äòashar fi 'ilm al-hajar al-mukarram (The Book of the Twelve Chapters on the Honourable Stone)...

Life Antonio Carracci Latona, with her children Apollo and Diana, turning the Lycian peasants into frogs. Whitfield Fine Art, London. Carracci was born in the parish of Sta Lucia in Venice, probably in 1583, the product of an affair with a courtesan called Isabella, occurring on his father first visit to Venice. Giovanni Battista Agucchi, a friend and prot√©g√© of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese tells us in a 1609 letter,September 12 raised along with Sisto Badalocchio and a near contemporary to Domenichino and Lanfranco. The main Baroque artist biographers of his time, Baglione, Bellori and Malvasia, make some note of him. He first apprenticed with his father. Malvasia recalls his father admired a ‚Äò‚ÄôMadonna and Child‚Äô‚Äô that completed at the age of seventeen. Annibale‚Äôs 1590s portrait of a boyUffizi 1668 E) recently published by Catherine Loisel-Legrand resembles those in Malvasia‚Äôs woodcut with 1678 ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôFelsina Pittrice‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô. He may also be the boy in the Brera portrait group, including Annibale‚Äôs father Mastro Antonio. When his father died in 1602, Antonio moved to Rome to work under his uncle Annibale to whom he developed a deep affection. He likely worked on the frescoes of the Galleria Farnese, on the lunettes for the Palazzo Aldobrandini chapel, and probably in the Herrera Chapel. After his uncle‚Äôs passing he received commissions in Rome from Cardinal Tonti and Cardinal Peretti-Montalto, including the ‚Äò‚ÄôStanza del Diluvio‚Äô‚Äô in the Quirinal Palace, and major altarpieces like ‚Äò‚ÄôMadonna and Child with Saints‚Äô‚Äô (in Berlin) and the Galleria Corsini's ‚Äò‚ÄôNativity‚Äô‚Äô. The self-assurance of the letters he wrote to Cardinal Farnese and his father‚Äôs old protector, Cardinal Spinola, after his uncle‚Äôs death suggest they were written by Agucchi, who in his slightly later (September 12, 1609) letter to Dulcini all about Antonio, speaks of a career that is already well begun. Malvasia misquotes this letter and copies it as ‚Äò[Antonio‚Äôs work] seems that of a beginner‚Äô the MS actually says the opposite ‚Äòil suo fare non pare da principiante‚Äô. It is no surprise to see that Antonio speaks of the impegni that he already has, to read that he has learned enough ‚Äòtanto da tirarmi avanti da me stesso‚Äô, and that he sees himself as maintaining the Carracci school in Bologna, and turning the studio to service to the Farnese ‚Äòin essa scuola, procurer√≤ che s‚Äôavanzino in essa per dovere indirizzare l‚Äôopera l‚Äôoro al servizio di V.S. Ill.ma...‚Äô Antonio Carracci Landscape with Bathers, Palazzo Pitti, Florence. Antonio inherited the studio against the claims of Annibale‚Äôs surviving brother Giovanni Antonio, who contested the inheritance by throwing doubt on his nephew‚Äôs paternity. Despite gaining commissions, those from the Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, the main patron after the Farnese, declined once the cardinal's uncle Clement VIII died in 1605. This also coincides with the onset of Annibale‚Äôs incapacitating illness. The ascent of the Borghese Pope, Paul V, continued the decline of the studio. By report, Annibale could not receive Cardinal Scipione Borghese, slipping out of a back door when he came to the studio; but Antonio was introduced to the pope's Prodatario, Cardinal Tonti, also an avid collector. Tonti employed Antonio to paint four chapels in his church; other public commissions included a chapel in Santa Maria in Monticelli, work in Sant' Girolamo dei Schiavoni, Santa Maria in Trastevere, and Sant' Sebastiano fuori le Mura, and in Palazzo Mattei. Antonio and Guido Reni collaborated in the decoration of the Cappella dell‚Äô Annunciata in the Palazzo Quirinal, painting a frieze of the Stanza del Diluvio. He contributed, around 1616, to the Alexander frescoes done for Cardinal Peretti Montalto; other works were done for Marchese Giustiniani, Cardinal Orsino, the Ludovisi, Cavalier Sachetti, Dionigio Buonavia in Bologna; and of course he was under the protection of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who recognized him as his ‚Äòpittor di casa‚Äô and paid him a monthly stipend. Antonio was well known for doing cabinet-size compositions often based on the great variety of graphic material in possession of the Carracci studio. His masterpiece, The Delugepresently in the Louvre and sometimes derided as a ‚Äògrouillante collection d‚Äôacad√©mies‚Äô. was one of Cardinal Mazarin‚Äôs most prized pictures, and influential for Poussin‚Äôs early Battle paintings as well as his paintings of the Seasons for Louis XIV 40 years later. With his Reni-like refinement, articulation of narrative, space, gesture and expression, the Deluge was an important academic collaboration with Agucchi. The Rape of Europa, oil on canvas, in Pinacoteca, Bologna Antonio was greatly admired by contemporaries, such that made his early death a particularly tragic loss \\"nel morire che segu√¨ nel 1618 mostr√≤ tal contritione e sentimento che simil passaggi si vedono in pochi\\". Recently, his reputation has declined, and he has been described as a small-scale and awkward mimic of his elder's works. His friend Giulio Mancini said he not only inherited Annibale‚Äôs studio, but also \\"Herede dei suoi disegni et arte f√π Antonio...\\". Antonio, being as Guido put it, the ‚Äòultima scintilla (del) valor Caraccesco‚Äô had in fact more invested in the Carracci studio than anyone else. The original of the much copied composition of the Martyrdom of St Denis (‚ÄòSt Denis effrayant ses bourreaux‚Äô) is evidently by Antonio, and the companion subject to his St Paul baptizing St Denis. It was not an idle encomium on Mancini‚Äôs part when he spoke that Antonio ‚Äòmostr√≤ gran segni di dover venir grande‚Äô. All the same, it was easy for his identity to be subsumed to that of elder Carracci. Because he shared the same initials as his father and uncle, and because the Carracci often collaborated, paintings by them were often confused. When Padre Resta gave the drawing of the Deluge, which he had had from Bellori, to Max Emmanuel of Bavaria, he was pleased to hear that the Elector treasured the gift and kept it on a table at his bedside; but ‚Äòlo teneva per pittura d‚ÄôAnnibale‚Äô.

History During the 1980s, the U.S. Marine Corps began looking for a light armored vehicle to give their divisions greater mobility. They chose the Light Armored Vehicle design from GM Defense. It entered service with the Marines in 1983. The U.S. Army was interested in these vehicles at the time, but did not order any‚Äîalthough they did later with the introduction of the Stryker family of vehicles. The Army did, however, borrow at least a dozen LAV-25s for use by the 82nd Airborne Division, 3-73rd Armor for a Scout Platoon during the Gulf War. These LAV-25s were later returned to the Marine Corps after the conflict. The USMC ordered 758 vehicles of all variants. LAVs first saw combat during the Invasion of Panama in 1989, and continued service in the Gulf War, Iraq War, and the War in Afghanistan. The table of organization and equipment for an USMC light-armored reconnaissance battalion includes 56 LAV-25s, 16 LAV-ATs, 12 LAV-Ls, 8 LAV-Ms, 4 LAV-Rs, 4 LAV-C2s, and an unknown number of LAV-MEWSS vehicles. The LAV platform is planned to remain in service with the Marine Corps until 2035.A force of one: LAV-ATs test modernization upgrades - Dvidshub.net, 27 March 2014 The Marines aim to have prototypes for the LAV's replacement, dubbed the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV), by 2023. The ARV is planned to be a networked family of wheeled vehicles capable of performing various mission sets, with 500 to be procured.Marines Want Armored Recon Prototypes By 2023: F-35 On Wheels Or FCS Redux?. Breaking Defense. 10 May 2018. Design Powered by a 6V53T Detroit Diesel turbo-charged engine, they are four-wheel drive (rear wheels) transferable to Eight-wheel drive. These vehicles are also amphibious, meaning they have the ability to \\"swim\\", but are limited to non-surf bodies of water (no oceans). While engaged in amphibious operations, the maximum speed is approximately using equipped propellers. The current Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) modifications will hinder or eliminate amphibious ops. Typical land speeds are approximately 100 km/h (62.5 mph) in either 4- or 8-wheel drive; however, fuel economy decreases in 8-wheel drive. The vehicles operate on diesel fuel. They are equipped with a M242 Bushmaster 25 mm autocannon, two M240 7.62 mm machine guns, and two 4-barrel smoke grenade launchers located on the forward left and right sides of the turret. The crew is three; vehicle commander (VC), gunner, and driver; and four passengers (scouts) with combat gear. =Armor= Destroyed LAV-25 during the 1991 Gulf War The LAV-25 is a lightly armored vehicle. The base model is protected by light gauge high hardness steel armor (MIL-A-46100), varying in nominal thickness from 4.71 mm to 9.71 mm. This level of high-hardness steel armor is intended only to offer protection against small arms rounds such as the common 7.62x39mm M1943 ball used by the AKM, to achieve the lowest possible weight and cost.Thomas G. Melvin. \\"LAV ARMOR PLATE STUDY\\". U.S. ARMY MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY, April 1992. Page 1. Variants=LAV-25= Standard LAV fitted with a turret with 360¬∞ traverse, armed with an M242 25 mm chain gun with 420 rounds of 25 mm ammunition, both M791 APDS-T (Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot-Tracer) and M792 HEI-T (High Explosive Incendiary- Tracer), of which half is ready for use. One hundred fifty rounds are ready for use from one stowage bin, 60 from another stowage bin, the other 210 rounds are stowed elsewhere in the vehicle. A coaxial M240C machine gun is mounted alongside the M242, and a pintle-mounted M240B/G machine gun, with 1,320 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition, is mounted on the turret roof. The Canadian Army uses an upgraded version of this chassis for its Coyote Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicle. =LAV-25A1= The vehicle has been through many changes through the late 1990s. The new modification or SLEP has changed the LAV-25 to the LAV-25A1 standard and has been completely fielded. =LAV-25A2= Funding has been approved for continued upgrades to the LAV family to bring them up to the LAV-A2 standard. Phase I improvements include increased external and internal ballistic armor upgrades, improved fire suppression equipment, and upgrading the vehicle's suspension to the Generation II standard. Phase II upgrades include replacing the turret hydraulics with an electric drive system and replacing the thermal sight with an improved model incorporating a laser range finder for aircraft. To reflect the improved significant survivability and capability enhancements occurring today, the LAV is being renamed as the LAV-A2. The LAV-A2 project involved developing and installing an internal and external ballistic protection upgrade package, developed by Armatec Survivability, for the Light Armored Vehicles, an automatic fire suppression system for the interior of the vehicle and a Generation II suspension upgrade to support the added weight of the new armor. The suspension upgrade includes new struts/steering knuckles, torsion bars, shocks and mounts and driveshaft. The three-kit armor system provides the LAV with additional survivability against improvised explosive devices (IED) and direct-fire kinetic energy weapons. The LAV-25A2 includes the Improved Thermal Sight System (ITSS) developed by Raytheon, scheduled for fielding by the end of 2007. The ITSS provides the gunner and commander with thermal images, an eye-safe laser range finder, a fire-control solution and far-target location target grid information. The new armor will provide protection from 14.5 mm armor-piercing rounds, and include an anti-spall lining on the inside to further protect crew members. It will be similar to the protection found on the U.S. Army's LAV III \\"Stryker\\" variant. Tests by the U.S. Army's Operational Test Command (OTC), Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate at Fort Bragg demonstrated that the LAV-25A2 could be airdropped from transport aircraft, a capability of interest to Army airborne units.82nd Airborne Division's 3rd Brigade Combat Team airdrop tests Light Armor Vehicle - Army.mil, 25 January 2018 On 26 October 2018, Alpha Company, 4th Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division was activated equipped with ex-USMC LAV-25A2s. =LAV-25A3= In January 2019, General Dynamics was awarded a $37.2 million contract to upgrade the Marine Corps' LAV fleet.

Licinius and his son, depicted with haloes, on a gold coin The Battle of Chrysopolis was fought on 18 September 324 at Chrysopolis (modern √úsk√ºdar), near Chalcedon (modern Kadƒ±k√∂y), between the two Roman emperors Constantine I and Licinius. The battle was the final encounter between the two emperors. After his navy's defeat in the Battle of the Hellespont, Licinius withdrew his forces from the city of Byzantium across the Bosphorus to Chalcedon in Bithynia. Constantine followed, and won the subsequent battle. This left Constantine as the sole emperor, ending the period of the Tetrarchy. Background The navy of Licinius had suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of the Hellespont. His admiral, Abantus, had been outfought by Constantine's son, the caesar Crispus, despite the latter's distinctly smaller fleet.Faith and Practice in the Early Church: Foundations for Contemporary Theology ‚Äì Page 201 by Carl A. Volz History of the Later Roman Empire, Ad 284‚Äì622 Lpc: AD 285‚Äì476 ‚Äì Page 66 by Stephen [VNV] Mitchell Following this naval victory, Constantine crossed over to Asia Minor. He used a flotilla of light transports he had ordered to be built on the Bosphorus in order to avoid the enemy army, which, under the command of Licinius' newly appointed co-emperor Martinian, was guarding the coast at Lampsacus on the Hellespont.Grant (1985), p. 236 Following the destruction of his naval forces Licinius evacuated the garrison of Byzantium, which joined his main army in Chalcedon on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. From there he also summoned Martinian's forces and a band of Visigothic auxiliaries, under their leader Aliquaca (or Alica), to reinforce his principal army which had been depleted by its earlier defeat at the Battle of Adrianople.Grant (1993), p. 47Odahl, p. 180 It is not clear whether Martinian's forces reached Licinius before September 18 when Licinius was brought to battle by Constantine.Lenski, p. 76 Battle Constantine's army landed on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus at a place called the Sacred Promontory and marched southward towards Chalcedon. Licinius moved his army a few miles north towards Chrysopolis. Constantine's army reached the environs of Chrysopolis before the forces of Licinius. Following a retreat to his tent to seek divine guidance, Constantine decided to take the initiative.Odahl, p. 180 The religious aspect of the conflict was reflected in Licinius drawing up his battle lines with images of the pagan gods of Rome prominently displayed, whilst Constantine's army fought under his talismanic Christian standard, the labarum. Licinius had developed a superstitious dread of the labarum and forbade his troops from attacking it, or even looking directly at it.Odahl, p. 180 Constantine seemingly eschewed any subtlety of manoeuvre, he launched a single massive frontal assault on Licinius' troops and routed them.Odahl, p. 180Eusebius, ch. 17. He won a decisive victory in what was a very large-scale battle. According to the historian Zosimus, \\"There was great slaughter at Chrysopolis.\\"Zosimus 2.22.7. Licinius was reported to have lost 25,000 to 30,000 dead, with thousands more breaking and running in flight.Grant (1993), pp. 46‚Äì47 Licinius managed to escape and gathered around 30,000 of his surviving troops at the city of Nicomedia.Parker and Warmington, p. 261 Aftermath Recognising that his surviving forces in Nicomedia could not stand against Constantine's victorious army, Licinius was persuaded to throw himself on the mercy of his enemy. Constantia, Constantine's half-sister and Licinius' wife, acted as intermediary. Initially, yielding to the pleas of his sister, Constantine spared the life of his brother-in-law, but some months later he ordered his execution, thereby breaking his solemn oath. Licinius was suspected of treasonable actions and the army command pressed for his execution.Odahl, p. 160 A year later, Constantine's nephew the younger Licinius also fell victim to the emperor's anger or suspicions.Grant (1993), p.47-48 In defeating his last foe, Licinius, Constantine became the sole emperor of the Roman empire; the first such since the elevation of Maximian to the status of augustus by Diocletian in April 286.Dunstan, p. 436 After his conquest of the eastern portion of the Roman Empire Constantine made the momentous decision to give the east its own capital, and the empire as a whole its second.

Biography Portrait of Queen Christina of Sweden Beck was born in Delft, and was named after his uncle, a well-known poet from Arnhem.David Beck biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He was the son of a schoolmaster in Delft, where he learned painting from Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt, a prominent portrait painter in the Netherlands. Late in 1640 he moved to London to join Anthony van Dyck's studio as a pupil and assistant, but had little time to learn from Van Dyck himself as the latter fell ill and died in 1641. Beck possessed the freedom of hand and readiness, or rather rapidity of execution, for which Van Dyck was so remarkable, in so much that when Charles I observed the expeditious manner of Beck's painting, he exclaimed, \\"Faith! Beck, I believe you could paint riding post\\" and asked him to teach his sons drawing. He taught drawing to Charles II of England and his brothers James II of England, and Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester. After the outbreak of the English Civil War that eventually led to the execution of his patron Charles I, Beck left England to travel around the courts of Europe. In 1647, he was appointed portrait painter and valet de chambre to Queen Christina of SwedenFaith Paulette Dreher, \\"David Teniers II Again, The Art Bulletin, vol. 59 (Mar., 1977), pp. 108-110. in Stockholm, and he executed portraits of most of the sovereigns of Europe to adorn her gallery. Christina sent him on tour to the European courts, apparently also for political purposes. While sick in Germany he was thought dead and prepared for burial, but he revived and was gradually restored to life. He joined Christina's court again in Rome in 1655, followed her to France in 1656. He asked leave from her company to visit his friends and family in the Netherlands, which according to Houbraken was against her wishes. His death at The Hague that same year was suspected of being due to poisoning.

Clogging is the official state dance of Kentucky and North Carolina. Description The dance style has recently fused with others including African-American rhythms, and zapateo/zapateado (which may in itself be derived from early European clog dances), resulting in the birth of newer street dances, such as tap, locking, hakken, stomping, and Gangsta Walking. The use of wooden-soled clogs is rarer in the more modern dances since clog shoes are not commonly worn in urban society, and other types of footwear have replaced them in their evolved dance forms. Clogging is often considered the first form of street dance because it evolved in urban environments during the industrial revolution. In later periods it was not always called \\"clogging\\", being known variously as foot- stomping, buck dancing, clog dancing, jigging, or other local terms. What all these had in common was emphasizing the downbeat of the music by enthusiastic footwork. As for the shoes, many old clogging shoes had no taps and some were made of leather and velvet, while the soles of the shoes were either wooden or hard leather. Clogging can be divided into five major categories: 1) shuffle clogging, 2) cadence clogging, 3) rhythm clogging, 4) stomp clogging, and 5) buck-dancing. The shuffle clogging style is said to be the most popular style for bluegrass music cloggers while rhythm and stomp clogging are more popular with old-time music cloggers. What sets clogging apart from other dance styles such as tap-dancing is the lack of upper body movement used during performance like Irish Sean-n√≥s dance which had significant influence on the origins of the dance. While tap dancers place emphasis on stage presence and arm movements, cloggers limit their upper body movement, focusing primarily on their feet. Antecedents In the United States, team clogging originated from square dance teams in Asheville, North Carolina's Mountain Dance and Folk Festival (1928), organized by Bascom Lamar Lunsford in the Appalachian region. American Clogging is associated with the predecessor to bluegrass‚Äî\\"old-time\\" music, which is based on English, and Irish fiddle tunes as well as African banjo tunes. Clogging primarily developed from Irish step dancing called Sean- n√≥s dance;http://www.doubletoe.com/history.htm there was also some English, Scottish, German, and Cherokee step dances, as well as African rhythms and movement influences too. It was from clogging that tap dance eventually evolved. Now, many clogging teams compete against other teams for prizes such as money and trophies. Terminology The term \\"buck,\\" as in buck dancing, is traceable to the West Indies and is derived from a Tupi Indian word denoting a frame for drying and smoking meat; the original 'po bockarau' or buccaneers were sailors who smoked meat and fish after the manner of the Indians. Another source states that the word \\"bockorau\\" can be traced to the \\"Angolan\\" word \\"buckra', and was used to refer to white people, which is disputed. Eventually the term came to describe Irish immigrant sailors whose jig dance was known as 'the buck.'\\" Another origin of the term \\"buck dance\\" comes from the idea that this style of dance was a flirtation. The male dancer would show off his skills on the dance floor to attract the female, thus being compared to the buck's courting ritual of the doe. One source states that buck dancing was the earliest combination of the basic shuffle and tap steps performed to syncopated rhythms in which accents are placed not on the straight beat, as with the jigs, clogs, and other dances of European origin, but on the downbeat or offbeat, a style derived primarily from the rhythms of African tribal music. Buck dancing was popularised in America by minstrel performers in the late 19th century. Many folk festivals and fairs utilise dancing clubs or teams to perform both Buck and regular clogging for entertainment. Traditional Appalachian clogging is characterised by loose, often bent knees and a \\"drag- slide\\" motion of the foot across the floor, and is usually performed to old- time music.

C. Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity (Edinburgh: University Press, 1991), p.77. (Online text.) Ella Amida would then be his throne name, although Ousanas is the name that appears on his coins. If this identification is correct, then it was during his reign that Christianity was introduced to Axum and the surrounding territories. W.R.O. Hahn, in a study published in 1983, identifies Sembrouthes, who is known only from an inscription found in Daqqi Mahari in modern Eritrea, with Ousanas.

He also worked as a journalist for The Statesman from 1945-1949. He was also associated with the daily The Forward, then edited by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, as the organ of All India Forward Bloc. He had also worked for several companies such as Light of Asia Insurance Company from 1930‚Äì1933, ARP from 1942‚Äì1945, DVC from 1949‚Äì1954, and Institute of Public Opinion from 1954-1956. He worked as a part-time lecturer of Comparative Literature in Jadavpur University from 1956-1957. In 1957, he left for his final foreign trip and toured Japan and Europe before moving to United States of America to join University of Chicago to write his autobiography in English. However he left the lucrative job midway and returned home to rejoin Jadavpur University to resume his classes of Comparative Literature, which he continued till his death.

The paper is only distributed on weekdays and is aimed at the working class. The estimated average daily circulation of the paper is around 900,000-1,000,000.Yahoo! HONG KONG, updated on 13/9/05 The paper provides local and international news as well as articles on business news, entertainment, lifestyle and sports.  Reasons for the launch of the newspaper  The newspaper was launched as the Chairman of Sing Tao News Corporation, Charles Ho Tsu Kwok (), felt there was room for the further development of free newspapers in Hong Kong in terms of content, distribution network and advertising formats. The pace of life in Hong Kong is so fast and people are so busy that Headline Daily was established to meet the people's needs by providing them with first-hand information on the hottest daily topics in a manner as concise and lively as possible, while attempting to portray a \\"positive\\" and \\"lively\\" image to readers. In terms of market competition, the Headline Daily was also launched in a bid to gain a greater market share of the territory's advertising market for Sing Tao News Corporation and to explore a new source of income for the corporation.  Distribution  Daily issues are distributed during morning peak hours from Monday to Friday, except on public holidays. It is distributed in more than 600 different places, among which there are now three fixed distribution media: McDonald's restaurants, KCR stations (except Tsim Sha Tsui East, Tai Wai, Racecourse and Sheung Shui Stations), and nearly 500 residential estates. Moreover, the papers are distributed at more than 100 fixed or non-fixed spots, including commercial buildings, bus/mini-bus stops and shopping malls all around Hong Kong. Readers may simply get a free issue from the eye-catching red shelves at most locations or from the staff at certain locations.  Readership  The newspaper targets the working population, who are usually too busy to read a large number of pages nor to read every piece of news in detail. However, these people are likely to grasp every chance to read newspapers for a short period when travelling or having breakfast. In August 2005, a market research survey was conducted by Synovate, comparing the readership of 3 free newspapers in Hong Kong. The result shows that in the first three weeks of August, Metropolis Daily, Headline Daily and am730 respectively achieved 16%, 18% and 8% of the market shares. Headline Daily gains the leading readership of 893,000, compared with Metropolis Daily's 820,000 and am730's 401,000.Circulation survey , UCLA  Contents  \\"Headline Daily\\" shares news sources with the Sing Tao Daily. The paper aims to present the most important news of the day in a concise way so as to provide readers with up-to-date, yet comprehensive, news and information on different areas in a short read. It usually has around 24 to 30 pages and has a layout similar to the following formats: *Headlines (i.e. coverpage; with daily information such as Marksix Result, Activities of the Day, Lunar Calendar and Weather Forecast) *Local News (with critics) *China News *International news *Financial news (i.e. news on Real Estate, Business and stock market) *Sports news *Lifestyle (different topics for each day: Technology(Monday), Fashion(Tuesday), Shopping(Wednesday), Amusement(Thursday) and Food(Friday)) *Entertainment (local and international entertainment news, along with Television Programme Schedule) *The remaining pages are used for advertisements. In a comment by Sing Tao chief executive Lo Wing-hung, he claimed that the average number of pages could be increased to 40 pages if its readership increases significantly over time. However, so far, more than three months after the first publication, the newspaper only consists of around 24 pages on the average. Marketing strategies Headline Daily implements marketing strategies including: * \\"lucky draws\\" & \\"voting games\\" * \\"apple- shaped pellet\\": a massage device, which working class readers can use to relax themselves and relieve their stress, was once offered to readers along with their newspaper * \\"happy lucky reader\\": one reader is randomly chosen in public areas (e.g. in a MTR train) and awarded HK$500 on a daily basis Moreover, to extend the market to overseas, a softcopy version Headline Daily is made accessible on line.  Public relations  Headline Daily invites readers to submit news articles for publication in return for rewards as a sign of its co-operation with the public. According to the official website, readers can become reporters for Headline Daily by handing in any information. While this information should be deemed to be news-worthy, other guidelines are provided on what type of news should be submitted. Particularly, the paper states that it has no interest in collecting any commentaries from the public. Meanwhile, the usage of any material submitted is solely dependent on the newspaper's discretion. The paper rewards any readers whose materials are published or utilised with a one-time sum of $100, regardless of how many times the paper uses these pieces of news.

He is known primarily from inscriptions in South Arabia that mention him and his son BYGT (also vocalized as \\"Beyga\\" or \\"Beygat\\"). GDRT is thought to be the same person as GDR, the name inscribed on a bronze wand or sceptre that was found in an area near Atsbi and Dar'a/Addi- Galamo in northern Ethiopia.Munro-Hay, Stuart. Aksum: an African Civilization of Late Antiquity (Edinburgh: University Press, 1991), p. 75 GDRT has been equated with the anonymous king of the Monumentum Adulitanum, which would date his reign c. 200 - c. 230. However, the two rulers are usually thought to be distinct.Identification with the king of Monumentum Adulitanum: Alexander Sima, \\"GDR(T)\\", in Siegbert Uhlig, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p.719. However the French scholar Christian Robin, studying the inscriptions at al-Mis\`al in Yemen, has shown that GDRT, and his successor \`DBH, lived in the earlier half of the 3rd century.Cited in S. C. Munro-Hay, Excavations at Aksum: an account of research at the ancient Ethiopian capital directed in 1972-4 by the late Dr Neville Chittick (London: British Institute in East Africa, 1989), p. 23 Aksumite inscription The inscriptions of GDR represent the oldest surviving royal inscriptions in the Ge'ez alphabet.Sima \\"GDR(T),\\" p.718. The oldest of these was found at Addi-Galamo in the regions of Atsbi and Dar'a in eastern Tigray Region in northern Ethiopia. The area is rich in pre-Aksumite artifacts,Rodolfo Fattovich, \\"Addi Galamo\\", in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C (Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003), p.76; Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum. pp. 48‚Äì50. and inscriptions of a pre-Aksumite kingdom called D ømt have been found in the region. The inscription mentioning GDR is the only evidence of his existence from the western side of the Red Sea: :gdr / ng≈õy /  æksm / tb øl / mzlt / l ærg / wllmq The Addi Galamo inscription was written on a sceptre or \\"boomerang-like object\\";Sima, \\"GDR(T),\\" p.719. the linguist A.J. Drewes therefore interprets mzlt as meaning a sceptre or royal emblem. The inscription's meaning is uncertain, but if mzlt is taken to mean a sceptre, and  ærg and lmq are taken to be place names (or sanctuaries), then, according to Alexander Sima, the text could mean \\"GDR, king of Aksum gave (this) sceptre into the possession of (the sanctuaries)  æRG and LMQ.\\" The South Arabian expert W.F. Albert Jamme, however, translates the inscription as \\"GDR king of Aksum occupied the passages of \`RG and LMQ\\", or \\"Gedara, King of Axum is humbled before the [gods] Arg and Almouqah,\\" (i.e. Almaqah or Ilmuqah), assuming that the  æ in Ilmuqah was assimilated.As cited by Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum. p. 67.  South Arabian involvement The thumb GDRT is first mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions as an ally of \`Alhan Nahfan, king of Saba, in an inscription at Ma·∏•ram Bilqƒ´s, at Ma'rib in Yemen, the temple of the moon god Almaqah /Ilmuqah.Munro-Hay, Aksum, pp. 71‚Äì2 According to Stuart Munro-Hay, the inscription reads :they agreed together that their war and their peace should be in unison, against anyone that might rise up against them, and that in safety and in security there should be allied together Salhen and Zararan and \`Alhan and Gadarat.Munro-Hay, Stuart. Aksum. p. 72 Alexander Sima translates the text slightly differently, specifying that it was GDRT who \\"sent a diplomatic mission to [\`Ahlan] in order to form an alliance.\\" Both interpret \\"Zararan\\" or \\"Zrrn\\" as the name of the palace in Aksum at the time, parallel to \\"Sahlen,\\" the palace of Saba in Marib. This Sahlen-Saba parallel, along with the Dhu-Raydan-·∏§imyar parallel, was often used by Aksumite kings in their inscriptions enumerating the territories under their control. A ·∏§imyarite inscription confirms the Sabaean text, mentioning that Aksum, Saba', ·∏§a·∏ëramawt, and QatabƒÅn were all allied against ·∏§imyar. \`Alhan Nafhan's son Sha\`ir Awtar or Sha\`irum Awtar later abandoned the alliance with GDRT after he became king of Saba'. However, during the first part of Sha\`ir Awtar's reign, the two powers seem to have joined in an alliance once again, this time against ·∏§a·∏ëramawt. Saba's invasion of ·∏§a·∏ëramawt with Aksumite help culminated in the latter's defeat and the occupation of its capital, Shabwah, in 225. Sha\`ir Awtar's attack represented a major shift in policy as, before the attack, the king of ·∏§a·∏ëramawt, Il\`azz Yalut, was married to his sister; he had even helped suppress a revolt against Il\`azz Yalut. Although Saba' was previously allied with Aksum against ·∏§imyar, both ·∏§imyarite and Sabaean troops were used in the attack against ·∏§a·∏ëramawt. Immediately following the conquest of Hadramaut, Sha\`ir Awtar allied with ·∏§imyar against his former ally GDRT. A second Sabaean inscription from the sanctuary 'Awam in Marib during the reign of Sha\`ir Awtar's successor, Luha\`atht Yarhum, describes events in the latter part of his predecessor's reign. The inscription tells of a diplomatic mission sent by Sha\`ir Awtar to GDRT, the results of which are unknown; however, the text later goes on to describe a war between Saba' and Aksum in the southern highlands of Yemen, implying that the negotiations were futile. Aksum lost a battle as a result of the Saba'-·∏§imyar alliance, allowing the South Arabian forces to expel GDRT's son BYGT and his forces from the ·∏§imyarite capital Zafar, which had previously been held by Aksum after the Aksum-·∏§a·∏ëramawt-QatabƒÅn-Saba' alliance. Despite this loss, Aksum still held territory in South Arabia, as evidenced by inscriptions of Luha\`atht Yarhum (r. c. 230), which detail at least one known clash with hb≈°t troops in Yemen after GDRT's reign. Peace may have been established after GDRT's death, but war and Aksumite involvement was renewed under his successors such as \`DBH and GRMT, and the whole 3rd century was to be dominated by Ethio-Yemeni conflicts.  Legacy  GDRT was most likely the first Aksumite king to be involved in South Arabian affairs, as well as the first known king to be mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions. His reign resulted in the control of much of western Yemen, such as the TihƒÅmah, NajrƒÅ, Ma\`afir, ·∫íafƒÅr (until c. 230), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands. Furthermore, GDRT's military alliances and his conquests in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the required formidable fleet for such feats, and the extension of Aksumite influence throughout Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia all reflect a new zenith in Aksumite power. His involvement would mark the beginning of centuries of Aksumite involvement in South Arabia, culminating with the full-scale invasion of Yemen by King Kaleb in 520 (or 525), resulting in the establishment of an Aksumite province covering all of South Arabia. GDRT's name may be preserved in Ethiopian tradition through the traditional king lists, as what seem to be variants of his name crop up in three of them. G…ôdur is listed as the third king in list C, Zegduru (ze meaning 'of' in Ge'ez) appears as the sixth in list E, and Zegdur appears as the third in list B, after the legendary Menelik I. Zegdur also is mentioned in at least one hagiography and short chronicle. The king lists were composed centuries after the fall of the Aksumite kingdom, however, and generally do not agree with archaeological records except when concerning famous kings.Wolfgang Hahn, \\"Coinage\\" in Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C, p.767.

Bush and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili by throwing a hand grenade at them on 10 May 2005. The attempt failed when the grenade did not detonate. He was later arrested and sentenced to life in prison. Background Vladimir Arutyunian, a Georgian citizen and ethnic Armenian, was born on 12 March 1978 in Tbilisi, Soviet Georgia. Arutyunian lost his father at an early age and lived with his mother, who was a stall-holder at the local street market. They lived in one of the poorest suburbs of Tbilisi. After completing his secondary education, he had no fixed occupation. He joined the Democratic Union for Revival party led by Aslan Abashidze in January 2004, but soon after left the organization's ranks. He joined the Revival party in the same month Mikheil Saakashvili became president of Georgia, and had led Adjara in a crisis by refusing to obey the central government authorities. Saakashvili and his party were considered to be pro‚ÄìUnited States, while Abashidze and his party were considered to be pro-Russia. The crisis had ended in later 2004 without bloodshed.  Assassination attempt  Presidents George W. Bush (left) of the U.S. and Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia (right) in Tbilisi on 10 May 2005 On 10 May 2005, Arutyunian waited for the United States President George W. Bush and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to speak in Tbilisi's central Liberty Square. When Bush began speaking, Arutyunian threw a Soviet-made RGD-5 hand grenade, wrapped in a red tartan handkerchief, toward the podium where Bush stood as he addressed the crowd. The grenade landed from the podium, near where Saakashvili, his wife Sandra E. Roelofs, Laura Bush, and other officials were seated. The grenade failed to detonate. Although original reports indicated that the grenade was not live, it was later revealed that it was. After Arutyunian pulled the pin and threw the grenade, it hit a girl, cushioning its impact. The red handkerchief remained wrapped around the grenade, and it prevented the striker lever from releasing. A Georgian security officer quickly removed the grenade, and Arutyunian disappeared. Arutyunian later said that he threw the grenade \\"towards the heads\\" so that \\"the shrapnel would fly behind the bulletproof glass\\". Bush and Saakashvili did not learn of the incident until after the rally.  Investigation  On 18 July 2005 Georgia's Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili issued photos of an unidentified suspect and announced a reward of 150,000 lari (US$80,000) for information leading to the suspect's identification. At the request of the Georgian government, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation began an investigation into the incident. Extra manpower was brought in from the surrounding region to help with the investigation. In one picture of the crowd, the FBI noted a man in the bleachers with a large camera. He was a visiting professor from Boise, Idaho. FBI agents contacted him and, with his photographs, were able to identify a suspect.  Arrest  On 20 July 2005, acting on a tip from a hotline, police raided Arutyunian's home where he lived with his mother. During an ensuing gunfight, Arutyunian killed the head of the Interior Ministry's counterintelligence department, Zurab Kvlividze. He then fled into the woods in the village of Vashlijvari on the outskirts of Tbilisi. After being wounded in the leg, he was captured by Georgia's anti-terror unit. DNA samples from the man matched the DNA samples from the handkerchief. Georgian police later found a chemical lab and a stockpile of explosives, chemicals and other material Arutyunian had built up in his apartment.https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2006/january/grenade_attack011106 Twenty liters (5.3 U.S. gallons) of sulfuric acid, several drawers full of mercury thermometers, a microscope, and \\"enough dangerous substances to carry out several terrorist acts\\" were found.  Trial  After his arrest, Arutyunian was shown on television admitting from his hospital bed that he had thrown the grenade. He said that he had attempted to assassinate both presidents because he hated Georgia's new government for being a \\"puppet\\" of the United States. He further stated that he did not regret what he did and would do it again if he had the chance. Arutyunian initially admitted his guilt when arrested but refused to cooperate during the trial. He pleaded not guilty, then refused to answer questions in court. His lawyer Elisabed Japaridze said after the conviction and sentencing that she would appeal. \\"I consider that everything was far from proved.\\" She cited the fact that Arutyunian's fingerprints were not found on the grenade. However, prosecutor Anzor Khvadagiani said that the grenade being wrapped in cloth explained the lack of distinguishable fingerprints and also that DNA tests of material found on the cloth matched Arutyunian's. Prison sentence On 11 January 2006 a Georgian court sentenced Arutyunian to life imprisonment for the attempted assassination of George Bush and Mikheil Saakashvili, and the killing of Officer Kvlividze. In September 2005, a United States federal grand jury also indicted Arutyunian, and could ask to extradite him if he is ever released. He is not eligible for parole, and could only be released under a presidential pardon, but such pardons are almost never granted in Georgia. While in prison in February 2010, Arutyunian converted from the Armenian Apostolic Church to Islam.

Many NDP serve as acceptor while NTP are donors of phosphate group. The general reaction via ping-pong mechanism is as follows: XDP + YTP ‚Üê‚Üí XTP + YDP (X and Y each represent different nitrogenous base). NDPK activities maintain an equilibrium between the concentrations of different nucleoside triphosphates such as, for example, when guanosine triphosphate (GTP) produced in the citric acid (Krebs) cycle is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Other activities include cell proliferation, differentiation and development, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor, endocytosis, and gene expression. Structure NDPK are homo hexameric proteins made up of monomers approximately 152 amino acids long with a theoretical weight of 17.17KDa. The complex is found in mitochondria and in the soluble cytoplasm of cells.  Function  NDPK are found in all cells, displaying not much specificity towards the types of nucleoside bases and are capable of accepting nucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides as substrates or donors. Therefore, NDPK is the source of RNA and DNA precursors, except ATP. NDPK utilize specific enzyme kinetics for multi-substrate reaction, namely ping-pong mechanism. A ping-pong mechanism integrates phosphorylation of a histidine residue by transferring terminal phosphate group (Œ≥-phosphate) from ATP to NDP Œ≤-phosphate in order to produce a NTP, and NDPK catalyzes such reversible reactions. NTP phosphorylates a histidine, which in turn phosphorylates NDP. NDPK are involved in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP), such as guanosine triphosphate (GTP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP), thymidine triphosphate (TTP). 420x420px Behind this apparently simple reaction is a multistep mechanism. The key steps of transphosphorylation are as follows: * NDPK binds to a NTP1 * A phosphoryl group from NTP1 is transferred to His in active site of NDPK * Phosphoenzyme intermediate is formed * Initially bound NDP1 is released from NDPK bringing in new NDP2 * Phosphoryl group is transferred from NDPK-His to NDP2 or dNDP2, creating a bound NTP2 * NDPK releases the new NTP2 Each step is part of a reversible process, such that the multistep equilibrium is of the following form. :NDPK + NTP ‚Üî NDPK~NTP ‚Üî NDPK-P~NDP ‚Üî NDPK-P + NDP NDPK‚Äôs roles in these NTPs differ; generally, kinases bring in NTPs for nucleic acid synthesis. CTP is provided for lipid synthesis, UTP for polysaccharide synthesis while GTP is used for protein elongation and signal transduction. During cAMP-mediated signal transduction, NDPK is responsible for phosphorylating GDP released from G proteins activated from receptor binding; once ATP donates a phosphate group via activity of NDPK, GTP is consecutively bound. Increased activity of membrane-associated NDPK yields cAMP synthesis. NDPK controls K+ channels, G proteins, cell secretion, cellular energy production, and UTP synthesis. Regulation=Inhibition by AMPK= NDPK usually consumes ATP, the most abundant cellular nucleotide, and stores the nucleotides. However, consumption of ATP would definitely influence the cellular energy balance, which brings upon the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts as the energy sensor and regulates ATP pathways by turning the generating pathways or not. Because of such activity, AMPK could directly inhibit NDPK through phosphorylation. To be more specific, NDPK supports the production of nucleotides in high-energy and low-stress cellular states. However, this can only happen when AMPK is inactivated because low-stress cellular states of ATP triggers the activation of AMPK, which eventually decreases NDPK activity by phosphorylating serine residues. Prokaryotic systems In most prokaryotes, the NDPK enzyme is tetrameric. It has been reported in a number of pathogens. NDPK function has been studied in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Microccocus luteus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Prokaryotic NDPK forms a functional homotetramer. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity involves the transfer of the Œ≥-phosphate of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to nucleoside diphosphate (NDP), where N1 and N2 can be ribo- or deoxyribonucleosides. This is done via a high energy phosphohistidine intermediate. Besides involvement in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, prokaryotic NDPK is also involved in several metabolism cycles. NDPK has also been discovered to act as a protein histidine kinase, which involves a reversible histidine phosphorylation as a well-known regulatory signal. However, in most prokaryotes, NDPK expression levels are involved in the cell growth, development and differentiation of the organism, especially bacteria. 320x320px =(p)ppGpp metabolism= In the (p)ppGpp biosynthesis cycle, NDPK serves an important role. When there is an absence of a charged tRNA in the A site of a ribosome, the ribosome will stall and trigger the synthesis of the guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp) molecule. (p)ppGpp biosynthesis is a part of the purine metabolism pathway and coordinates a series of cellular activities in response to nutritional abundances. Synthesis of (p)ppGpp is triggered by carbon starvation, or the lack of carbon in the cell's environment, and causes the protein SpoT to activate. SpoT works in conjunction with NDPK and both serve as essential enzymes in the (p)ppGpp biosynthesis cycle. NDPK synthesizes the formation of GDP from GTP via dephosphorylation. =Nm23 gene function= While the biomolecular mechanism by which the Nm23 gene works in cells is currently unknown, like in most prokaryotes, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) expression levels determine cell growth and differentiation. Normally, the Nm23 gene (NME) is involved in metastasis suppression in humans. In prokaryotes, the Nm23 gene is involved in normal cell development and differentiation. Highly conserved homologues of the Nm23 gene have been found in prokaryotes, more specifically, Myxococcus xanthus, a gram negative soil bacteria. Homologues of Nm23 in M. xanthus have been closed and characterized as a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (ndk gene) and seems to be essential for M. xanthus growth. During M. xanthus development, nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity has also been shown to drastically decrease. Eukaryotic systems There are at least four enzymatically active isoforms of NDPK in humans: NDPK-A, NDPK-B, NDPK-C and NDPK-D. All four isoforms have very similar structures and can combine in any form to become functional NDPK hexamers. NDPK is suggested to participate in transmembrane signaling in eukaryotic cells. =In humans= In Eukaryotic systems, the role of the NDK is to synthesize nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP. The ATP gamma phosphate is transferred to the NDP beta phosphate via a ping-pong mechanism, using a phosphorylated active-site intermediate, and synthesize products such as UTP. NDK possesses nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate kinase, histidine protein kinase, and 3'-5' exonuclease activities. Its processes are involved with cell proliferation, differentiation and development, and gene expression in human cells. It is also part of the neural development process, which includes neural patterning and cell fate determination. Furthermore, NDPK is involved with the signal transduction processes and G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis as it transfers a phosphate group onto the G Œ≤-subunits and convert GDP to GTP. This increase in GTP concentration near G protein Œ±-subunits causes activation of G protein Œ±-subunits for G-protein signaling. In addition to signaling, NDPK is involved in controlling K+ channels, cell secretion, and cellular energy production. = In plants = The biochemical reactions catalyzed by NDP kinase in plants are analogous to activities described in humans as autophosphorylation activity takes place from ATP and GTP. In addition to this, plants have four types of NDPK isoforms. Cytosolic type I NDPK is involved in metabolism, growth, and stress responses in plants. Type II NDPK is concentrated in the chloroplast and it is believed to be involved in the photosynthesis process and the oxidative stress management, but its function is not yet known clearly. Type III NDPK targets both mitochondria and chloroplast, and it is mainly involved in energy metabolism. The localization and exact function of the type IV NDPK is not yet well known and needs further investigations. In addition, NDPK is associated with H2O2-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in plants. Diseases related to NDPK Ten paralogous genes code for the proteins NDPKs, which are separated into two groups. The first group encodes proteins with NDPK functions. The other group genes code for other various proteins that display low or no NDPK activities. In the first group, one of the genes named NM23 was identified as the first metastasis suppressor protein and its gene Nm23 was less activated in metastatic cells. In a different experiment, human Nm23 was cultured with cancer cells and showed inhibition of metastasis. The level of NM23 protein was inversely proportional to the metastatic potential for human solid tumors. However, other tumor types such as ovarian cancers, neuroblastoma and hematological malignancies displayed upregulated NM23 levels in patient samples. Therefore, understanding the biological basis of the Nm23 gene family is necessary to have a firm knowledge of its diverse results. =Cardiovascular disease= Nme2, one of the NDPK genes, has been associated with cardiovascular functions. Nme2 gene is known to form a complex with the beta subunit of the heterotrimetric G protein in heart cells and regulates the contractility of heart. There are two functions of Nme2 that allow for such regulation; one is the histidine kinase activity, which is the phosphorylation of the channels to regulate what goes through and the other is a scaffold function of the formation of caveolae. The depletion of Nme2/caveolin interaction exhibited a decreased rate of cardiac contractility. Furthermore, more studies with zebra fish revealed that the NDPK depletion has a detrimental effect on heart functioning. =Nme1 and Nme2 as a suppressor of metastasis= There was a lot of debate on whether NM23 gene is responsible for suppressing or activating metastasis. The two contradicting sides on this subject remained ambiguous and undefined throughout the course of NDPK studies. However, recent experiments began to show evidence for NM23 being a suppressor of metastasis. Nme2 was tagged as an anti-metastasis gene, using the tissue chip technology and immunohistochemistry. When Nme2 gene products were over-produced in gastric cancer cells, there was a decrease in proliferation, migration, and invasion of such cancer cells. The cell cultures revealed that Nme2 impacts gastric cancer cells, but the question still remains about what regulates Nme2 activities among various cancer types. Nme1 was found in great number in poorly metastatic sublines of melanoma cells. Also, the transfection of Nme1 into a highly metastatic melanoma line significantly reduced metastasis. This theory has been tested with mice as well; the Nme1-deficient mice formed greater lung metastases than wild type mice, showing that this gene has suppressing activity. Invasion of cancer occurs due to changes in cell adhesion and it is caused by gene expression changes in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Surprisingly, there are many adhesion molecules, motility factors, signaling pathways, proteolytic events, EMT hallmarks, and other transcriptional programs that have been linked to the Nme1 proteins. These proteins go about interrupting metastasis by binding metastasis-promoting proteins. The Nme1 proteins bind to viral proteins, oncogenes, and other metastasis-promoting factors. The binding may be indirect by using the signaling complex.

He helped to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, co-founded the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), and is regarded as the \\"Godfather of the ADA\\". Background Dart came from a wealthy Chicago family. His father, Justin Whitlock Dart Sr., was president of Dart Industries. His mother Ruth Walgreen Dart was the daughter of Walgreen founder Charles R. Walgreen and his wife Myrtle Walgreen. Justin's brother Peter Dart also developed polio. Dart contracted polio in 1948 before entering the University of Houston, where he earned undergraduate degrees in history and education in 1954; however, the university refused to give him a teaching certificate because of his disability. The university is now home to the Justin Dart Jr. Center for Students with Disabilities, a facility designed for students who have any type of temporary or permanent health impairment, physical limitation, psychiatric disorder, or learning disability. Activism During his time at the University of Houston, which was then segregated, Dart organized the first student group to oppose racism. After graduating, Dart was a successful entrepreneur who founded three Japanese corporations, but in 1967 he gave up the corporate life to devote himself to the rights of people with disabilities, working in Texas and Washington, D.C. as a member of various state and federal disability commissions. In 1972, Dart switched from identifying as a Democrat to become a Republican. He opposed the efforts of President Ronald Reagan, a personal friend of the Dart family, to revise the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, and in 1981 accepted an appointment from President Reagan to be the vice-chair of the National Council on Disability. On Capitol Hill, Dart worked closely with both Democratic and Republican Members of Congress to advance the rights of disabled people, including U.S. Congressman Major Owens of New York City, who served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Select Education in the U.S. House of Representatives during the late 1980s and early 1990s as well as during the early crafting of the legislative language and the fierce debates on the Americans' With Disability Act (ADA) before its eventual passage in the House of Representatives. =\\"Road to Freedom\\" tour (part one)= While serving as the vice chair of the National Council on Disability, Justin and Yoshiko Dart embarked on a nationwide tour, at their own expense, to meet with activists and individuals with disabilities. This tour, which took them to every state in the U.S., was a significant undertaking for both the Darts and the individuals that were visited. At the time of the Darts' tour, accessibility and universal design still were being developed in major cities and in smaller municipalities. To complete their journey, the Darts often had to find transportation and housing that could accommodate Justin Dart and his colleagues' wheelchairs. There weren't facilities that were readily available in every town that the Darts visited. Justin and Yoshiko did not make these trips alone, often partnering with local disability advocates, community members and friends. For many of the people with whom the Darts met, this was the first time that anyone had ever asked them as individuals with disabilities what they wanted from their government and country. Based on these conversations, Dart and others on the council drafted a national policy that called for national civil rights legislation to end the centuries-old discrimination of people with disabilities, what would eventually become the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In 1986, Justin was appointed to lead the Rehabilitation Services Administration, a federal agency under the United States Department of Education tasked with administering portions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Dart's tenure at RSA ended when at a congressional hearing he characterized the agency as \\"a vast, inflexible federal system which, like the society it represents, still contains a significant portion of individuals who have not yet overcome obsolete, paternalistic attitudes about disability.\\" Though he was asked to resign, Dart remained a functioning figure in disability policy even at the federal level, and in 1988, he was appointed co- chair of the Congressional Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities. =\\"Road to Freedom\\" tour (part two)= The Darts undertook another tour of the United States with the purpose of continuing a national dialogue about disability. Again with the support of friends and disability advocates, they visited all 50 states as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia to hold public forums that were attended by more than 30,000 people. This consistent advocacy and long-term conversation is what ultimately earned Justin the title of \\"Godfather of the ADA\\" as the information, network and diligence became the foundation of the legislative conversation around the ADA. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was signed into law on July 26, 1990. The signing ceremony included with President George H.W. Bush, Evan Kemp, Rev. Harold Wilke, Sandra Parrino, and Justin Dart. President George H.W. Bush signs the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 into law. Pictured (left to right): Evan Kemp, Rev. Harold Wilke, Pres. Bush, Sandra Parrino, Justin Dart After the ADA In 1993, Dart left his position on the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. Subsequently, Dart founded Justice for All with other activists to defend against congressional attempts to weaken the ADA, including those pushed for by Clint Eastwood. He also organized numerous ADA anniversary events. After the 1994 Congressional elections, Dart left the Republican party and eventually became a strong supporter of President Clinton. On July 25, 1995, Justin Dart founded the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) with Paul Hearne, Senator Bob Dole, John Kemp, Tony Coelho, Pat Wright, Jim Weisman, Lex Frieden, Sylvia Walker, Paul Marchand, Fred Fay, I. King Jordan, Denise Figueroa, Judi Chamberlin, Bill Demby, Deborah Kaplan, Nancy Bloch, Max Starkloff, Mike Auberger, Neil Jacobson, Ralph Neas, Ron Hartley and others. Dart suffered a series of heart attacks in late 1997, which curtailed his ability to travel. He continued, however, to lobby for the rights of people with disabilities, and attended numerous events, rallies, demonstrations and public hearings. Toward the end of his life, Dart was hard at work on a political manifesto that would outline his vision of \\"the revolution of empowerment.\\" In its conclusion, he urged his \\"Beloved colleagues in struggle, listen to the heart of this old soldier. Our lives, our children‚Äôs lives, the quality of the lives of billions in future generations hangs in the balance. I cry out to you from the depths of my being. Humanity needs you! Lead! Lead! Lead the revolution of empowerment!\\" Dart featured on ADA poster Dart received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the ceremony, Clinton said Dart had \\"opened the doors of opportunities to millions of our citizens by securing passage of one of the nation's landmark civil rights laws.\\" Death and legacy He died in Washington, D.C. on 22 June 2002 at the age of 71 from congestive heart failure related to complications of post-polio syndrome. For many members of the disability community especially in the Washington, D.C. area, Justin Dart is an icon for the modern disability movement and the ideals of inclusion, advocacy and leadership. In his final statement to the community for his death, Dart wrote: :I call for solidarity among all who love justice, all who love life, to create a revolution that will empower every single human being to govern his or her life, to govern the society and to be fully productive of life quality for self and for all. Ending with his closing of \\"Lead On\\", Dart's words have become a call for action and engagement for many who advocate for the issues of inclusion, and for all who believe in action and justice. Dart's usual wardrobe of a Stetson hat with a pin of the American flag on the band and cowboy boots have become symbols of the disability rights movement.

Shih Wing-ching, chairman of Centaline Holdings, a property agency, is the founder of the newspaper. He introduced the new paper due to the unprecedented success of Metropolis Daily, a pioneer in this market. Metropolis Daily was founded in 2002, and was so successful that it broke even in only fourteen months. Realising the profitability of the market, Shih established am730 in late July 2005  Overview  Owned and operated by AM730 Media Limited, am730 launched its first publication on 30 July 2005. It had been scheduled to be launched in September, but it was rescheduled to 30 July to keep up with one of its competitors, Headline Daily, which was launched on 12 July 2005, and for convenient coincidence that the date of 30 July (730) corresponded with the name of the newspaper. Two hundred thousand copies of am730 were issued at its first publication and its current circulation volume is around three hundred thousand copies daily. The name of the newspaper is intended to suggest a fresh approach towards the methodology of naming newspapers. It does not incorporate the term \\"daily\\" because this word reflects the conventional way of naming a news journal. The name literally states the newspaper's aim to distribute the publication during rush hour, which is approximately 7:30am. According to Shih, the newspaper is tailored to young people. 7:30am is about when the sun rises; it signals vitality, just like the young people who are at the start of a long journey through life. It is a new vision aimed to change the old quality of Hong Kong newspapers. In its first week, am730 sold one hundred thousand copies. Eventually, it aims to increase circulation to three hundred thousand copies, which is similar to the other two free newspapers (Metropolis Daily: 300,000; Headline Daily: 400,000). In January 2014, Shih revealed that many mainland companies were cancelling advertising with the paper, for its perceived anti-Beijing editorial stance.Cancelled adverts threaten paper, SCMP, 17 Jan 2014 Language and style The journal tends to adopt internet slang and other expressions which are widely used on the Internet and popular among youth. The newspaper official says it is advisable to use internet slang and does not think that colloquial expressions in newspaper articles will affect young people's language proficiency. What is more crucial is using popular language to convey messages. am730 intends to offer a fresh sensation in news to its readers; it aims to widen the horizon of its readers, both internationally and culturally, and to promote an optimistic outlook on life and hopes for the future. While being consistent with market regulations, am730 is a real newspaper which offers more attention to journalistic principles. Unlike numerous other newspapers, am730 is against the idea of indecent news as the selling point. It wants to provide a newspaper with accurate, simple news reports targeted to youth who have just begun their careers. The fresh, youthful style of am730 is designed to encourage more young people to read newspapers. Shih hopes that through this free newspaper, young people in Hong Kong will cultivate a greater interest in the news and in the future of Hong Kong. Headline Daily, a newspaper which belongs to Sing Tao, is the primary competition for am730. Shih admits that Headline Daily has more resources than the privately investigated am730 because of its attachment to Sing Tao Daily, but that dependence on Sing Tao would harm the independence of its organisation.  Content  The paper includes local, China, international, financial, entertainment and sports news. Additionally, Shih Wing Ching writes a column called \\"C Viewpoint\\" in which he gives his daily commentary on local or international news. \\"730 Angle\\" is also a commentary column, but for people from all walks of life. \\"Snapshot Hong Kong\\" is a column which cold-contacts youngsters on the street to ask their opinions. Hence, the major target of am730 is the young working class and it defines itself as a youth publication in the newspaper market. The reason for this, in Shih's own words, is because young people are full of hope: \\"Local papers follow the western view in that they will only report bad things, as if there is no hope in this world, yet hope is what young people mostly need.\\" The design and layout of the paper are colourful and appealing. The detailed layout of the newspaper is as follows: *Front page The lead story of the day occupies almost the entire page of the paper, filled in with colourful illustrations. The other stories vary from local top stories to China and international news. Similar to a traditional newspaper, on the left corner is a column which briefly highlights the news of secondary importance that is available inside the paper. The highlights vary, including local, China, international, entertainment and sport news. At the bottom of the column is a display of the Mark Six results. *Local Typically, around three to four pages are allocated to the local news section. More important news such as politics and policies are reported in greater length than city news such as accidents and events. To maximise space usage, even the banner at the top of the page is used to cover brief news accounts. Shih's personal column, \\"C Viewpoint,\\" can also be found in this section. There is also a column for weather forecasts for local, China and international locations. The banner of this section is sky-blue in colour. *China News from China and related to China's interests takes up about one to two pages of the paper. The banner colour of this section is khaki. *International The international section covers major news around the world. The banner colour of this section is dark blue. *Features When this section appears, it is placed in the middle of the paper and covers two pages, but it is not always printed. At times, the middle pages are occupied by a full-page advertisement. Feature stories, when available, offer in-depth reports and analysis. *Finance This is a short, concise one-page section on financial and business news, both locally and on the international arena. The banner colour of this section is dark green. *Sports The Sports section covers both the local and the international sports scene. On average it provides a scoreboard summary of final scores and, on occasion, a brief schedule of live sports coverage on television. The banner colour of this section is light green. *I.T. The I.T. section is dedicated to news of technological advancement and electronic products, including mobile phones, computers, television and much more. Not to be missed is news of the Internet and recommended websites. The banner colour of this section is light green. *Notes The Notes section usually offers articles of interesting, sometimes absurd events happening around the world. The banner colour of this section is purple. *OL (Office Lady) and Health This section is dedicated to young working women, similar to those offered in popular women's magazines. Besides tips and advice on women's health and beauty, there is also a section dedicated to relationship advice for women readers with personal problems. The banner colour of this section is pink. *Entertainment This section offers entertainment news regarding celebrities, music and movies. There are usually two pages dedicated to this section. One page focuses on local Hong Kong celebrities, while the other covers international celebrities. There are occasional extras in this section such as movie reviews and basic introductions of a foreign language. The banner colour of this section is mustard yellow. *Readers \\"730 Angle\\" offers letters and readers' opinions on various issues. There is also a small section on events and book reviews. On the right hand corner is a \\"snapshot\\" section dedicated to teen fashion and trends, including the mobile phones they use. *Leisure This section that relates tips and overviews of leisure activities. Generally this section contains comics, western horoscopes, tarot predictions of the future, and cooking tips and recipes. *Television This section provides a selected schedule of programmes offered on both local and cable television. At the bottom section, there is a review of some recommended programs. Last but not least are the credits of the editorial team as well as a list of contacts for the newspaper. *Back page The back page of the paper is typically occupied by a full-page advertisement. Generally, the news accounts presented are brief and limited, due at least in part to space limitations. As am730 is a free newspaper, the operating cost largely depends on the advertisement revenue. A full-page advertisement appears on every other page, mainly placed between the local news section and the finance section. Smaller advertisements are scattered throughout the newspaper. Nevertheless, the newspaper remains an effective and rapid way to inform commuters about current issues in Hong Kong and the rest of the world.  Editorial team  Currently, the editorial team consists of 50 people. Key staff are : *President: Alan Lo *Vice-President: Danny Fung and Ricky Lo *Sales and Marketing Director: Ray Lee *Associate Managing Editor: Dominic Leung *Marketing Manager: Agnes Chen *Chief Reporter: Kenneth Dai *General Chief Reporter: Ray Tsang *Photography Director: Edmond Wong *Arts Director: Spring Kwok Shih promised his staff that if the revenue and expenditures could be balanced within the first year, he would pay them seven more months of salary.  Operations  The initial launch of the newspaper cost up to HK$100 million. It was Shih's private investment. At the first stage, working capital was just HK$50 million; another HK$50 million will be invested if the operation proves successful. Shih Wing-ching expects that revenue and expenditures will be balanced after a year of publication. As a free newspaper, the major operational revenue is gained from commercial advertisements. After the first month of publication, the revenue gained from commercial advertisements was HK$100 million while am730 still needed to bear HK$100 million to HK$200 million in losses everyday. The advertising rates in am730 are estimated to be HK$24,000 ‚Äì HK$30,000, 30% to 40% lower than Metropolis Daily's rates of HK$32,000 to HK$40,000. This is a strategic action to attract more advertisements. From July 2013, under a six-year contract, the paper is printed by the South China Morning Post Group.SCMP signs six-year printing deal with free paper am730, SCMP, 13 July 2013 = Distribution points = am730 being distributed in Sheung Wan, near the Sheung Wan MTR entrance. am730 is distributed from Mondays to Fridays (except public holidays) at around 287 locations. Distribution locations include railway stations along the East Rail Line and West Rail Line, the entrances of Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations, private residential areas, and many points in the Central business district (or CBD). Due to limited human resources and the specific target group of am730, early distribution points were not as efficient. Its main focus is now in the commercial districts of Hong Kong such as Central, Wan Chai and Tsim Sha Tsui. Other services= Online papers = am730 is also accessible online. Besides viewing the most recent issue, readers can also view archived issues of am730 online. The e-paper is formatted in such a way that it resembles the actual printed paper. = Other special offers = am730 frequently offers free coupons. Readers can enjoy special offers by cutting the coupons published in the paper. One example was the Delifrance tea set offer on 10 October 2005.  Impact of am730  According to Shih, free newspapers represent the future trend of print news because they avoid conflict between readers and newspapers. The fact that am730 is convenient and free of charge has attracted a large group of readers away from the conventional newspapers. Besides the advantages of large circulation and a large group of readers, free newspapers attract many advertisers. According to a survey, Metropolis Daily advertisements ranked 6th in Hong Kong newspapers. It has thus become a big challenge for traditional newspapers to keep up with free newspapers. Starting 19 October 2005, The Sun, one of the newspapers under the Oriental Press Group Limited, cut the retail price for each paper to HK$3. It is believed to be responding to the emerging competition brought up by free newspapers. Other newspaper press groups declared they would not follow this action, but would closely monitor the situation. With the emergence of Headline Daily and am730 into Hong Kong's print media industry in July 2005, the competition among the numerous newspapers (free and traditional) is becoming increasingly stiff and unhealthy. In fact, the existence of free circulated tabloids in general can be seen as a form of \\"self killing\\" in the industry, in which free tabloids are \\"killing off\\" the traditional broadsheets in terms of readership and advertising revenue. Besides this, the saturated market of three free tabloids in Hong Kong can also result in non-profitability for weaker competitors. Another effect of the entry of am730 and other free tabloids into the market will be on the advertising revenue for traditional broadsheets. Being highly dependent on advertising revenue, traditional broadsheets now face intense competition from free tabloids that are also dependent on advertising revenue as a primary source for their survival. A major advantage of am730 is its easy accessibility to its readers. This means that despite higher advertising charges, companies might be willing to advertise in these papers to guarantee a higher exposure level for their products. There are 3 main Chinese free newspapers (the other two are Metropolis Daily and Headline Daily) and millions of copies are issued every day (two hundred thousand copies of am730, three hundred thousand copies of Metropolis Daily and four hundred thousand copies of Headline Daily). In a survey conducted by the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong in July 2005, by interviewing 1006 residents, 60% to 65% reported they had taken free newspapers, but 48.7% (nearly half) would throw the newspaper into rubbish bins instead of a recycle box. This practice is not only creating waste, but is also causing damage to the natural environment; for every metric ton of paper used, 17 trees are brought down and 1,500 litres of fuel oil are consumed. Readership A survey on Hong Kong free tabloid readership by Synovate, a leading research company, was conducted between 1 August 2005 and 21 August 2005. Metro Daily, Headline Daily and am730 have 16%, 18% and 8% of the total market share, respectively. From these figures, one can see that am730, with a low circulation of around 260,000 in comparison with the other two tabloids, is performing reasonably well for a starter. =Demographics= *Target readers am730 aims at expanding the readership of the young working class. With its primary target of readers in the younger demographic range, am730 has achieved its target; 65% of its readers are below 45 years of age, according to the survey. This could be seen as an achievement for the free tabloids whose professed aim is to raise awareness of current issues for the politically apathetic younger generation. *Occupation am730 is able to get a majority of its readers from the full-time working class, accounting for 81% of its readership according to the survey. This proves that the distribution of papers at railway stations does help in gaining accessibility to working class readers who commonly use public transportation. Also, am730 has a low readership from people in managerial positions, according to the survey. This is also true for other free tabloids. Generally, the percentage of professionals reading free tabloids only made up 7% of the total readership. In making their stories short and brief, am730 and other tabloids are definitely seen as lacking depth among higher-educated individuals. Newspaper vendors are upset because of falling sales in traditional newspapers, which directly harms their income. Hence, the vendors are seeking a deal with publishers of free newspapers to distribute the papers for a fee, and threaten to mount a noisy campaign if their requests are denied.

It is also sometimes used for poaching vegetables, eggs, sweetbreads, cockscombs, and delicate meats. It includes seasonings and salt but lacks animal gelatin. Description Court bouillon loosely translates as 'briefly boiled liquid' (French court) or \\"short broth\\" because the cooking time is brief in comparison with a rich and complex stock, and generally is not served as part of the finished dish. Because delicate foods do not cook for very long, it is prepared before the foods are added. Typically, cooking times do not exceed 60 minutes. Although a court bouillon may become the base for a stock or fumet, in traditional terms it is differentiated by the inclusion of acidulating ingredients such as wine, vinegar, or lemon juice. In addition to contributing their own flavor, acids help to draw flavors from the vegetable aromatics during the short preparation time prior to use. Court bouillon also includes salt and lacks animal gelatin. Types Traditionally, court bouillon is water, salt, white wine, vegetable aromatics (mirepoix of carrot, onion, and celery), and flavored with bouquet garni and black pepper. Court- bouillon need not be elaborate.

Arkansas Board of Education, 529 F. Supp. 1255 (E.D. Ark. 1982), was a 1981 legal case in the US state of Arkansas. A lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by various parents, religious groups and organizations, biologists, and others who argued that the Arkansas state law known as the Balanced Treatment for Creation- Science and Evolution-Science Act (Act 590), which mandated the teaching of \\"creation science\\" in Arkansas public schools, was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Judge William Overton handed down a decision on January 5, 1982, giving a clear, specific definition of science as a basis for ruling that creation science is religion and is simply not science. The ruling was not binding on schools outside the Eastern District of Arkansas but had considerable influence on subsequent rulings on the teaching of creationism.Understanding the Intelligent Design Creationist Movement: Its True Nature and Goals.

The defendants were the Arkansas Board of Education and its members, in their official capacity, the director of the Department of Education, in his official capacity, and the State Textbooks and Instructional materials Selecting Committee. The Pulaski County Special School District and its directors and superintendent were named in the original complaint but were voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs at the pre-trial conference on October 1, 1981. Background Various state laws prohibiting teaching of evolution had been introduced in the 1920s. They were challenged in 1968 at Epperson v. Arkansas which ruled that \\"The law's effort was confined to an attempt to blot out a particular theory because of its supposed conflict with the Biblical account, literally read. Plainly, the law is contrary to the mandate of the First, and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\\". The creationist movement turned to promoting teaching creationism in school science classes as equal to evolutionary theory. Arkansas Act 590 Arkansas Act 590 of 1981, entitled the \\"Balanced Treatment for Creation Science and Evolution Science Act,\\" mandated that \\"creation science\\" be given equal time in public schools with evolution. Creation science was defined as follows: \\"Creation science means the scientific evidences for creation and inferences from those evidences. Creation science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate: :#Sudden creation of the universe, energy and life from nothing; :#The insufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about development of all living kinds from a single organism; :#Changes only with fixed limits of originally created kinds of plants and animals; :#Separate ancestry for man and apes; :#Explanation of the Earth's geology by catastrophism, including the occurrence of worldwide flood; :#A relatively recent inception of the Earth and living. Evolution science was defined as follows: \\"Evolution-science\\" means the scientific evidences for evolution and inferences from those scientific evidences. Evolution-science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate: :#Emergence by naturalistic processes of the universe from disordered matter and emergence of life from nonlife; :#The sufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about development of present living kinds from simple earlier kinds; :#Emergency [sic] by mutation and natural selection of present living kinds from simple earlier kinds; :#Emergence of man from a common ancestor with apes; :#Explanation of the Earth's geology and the evolutionary sequence by uniformitarianism; and :#An inception several billion years ago of the Earth and somewhat later of life. The Act was signed into law by Governor Frank D. White on March 19, 1981. McLean v. Arkansas ruling Judge William Overton's ruling handed down on January 5, 1982, concluded that \\"creation-science\\" as defined in Arkansas Act 590 \\"is simply not science\\". The judgment defined the essential characteristics of science as being: :#It is guided by natural law; :#It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law; :#It is testable against the empirical world; :#Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and :#It is falsifiable. Overton found that \\"creation science\\" failed to meet these essential characteristics for these reasons: :#Sudden creation \\"from nothing\\" is not science because it depends upon a supernatural intervention which is not guided by natural law, is not explanatory by reference to natural law, is not testable and is not falsifiable; :#\\"insufficiency of mutation and natural selection\\" is an incomplete negative generalization; :#\\"changes only within fixed limits of originally created kinds\\" fails as there is no scientific definition of \\"kinds\\", the assertion appears to be an effort to establish outer limits of changes within species but there is no scientific explanation for these limits which is guided by natural law and the limitations, whatever they are, cannot be explained by natural law; :#\\"separate ancestry of man and apes\\" is a bald assertion which explains nothing and refers to no scientific fact or theory; :#Catastrophism and any kind of Genesis Flood depend upon supernatural intervention, and cannot be explained by natural law; :#\\"Relatively recent inception\\" has no scientific meaning, is not the product of natural law; not explainable by natural law; nor is it tentative; :#No recognized scientific journal has published an article espousing the creation science theory as described in the Act, and though some witnesses suggested that the scientific community was \\"close-minded\\" and so had not accepted the arguments, no witness produced a scientific article for which publication has been refused, and suggestions of censorship were not credible; :#A scientific theory must be tentative and always subject to revision or abandonment in light of facts that are inconsistent with, or falsify, the theory. A theory that is by its own terms dogmatic, absolutist, and never subject to revision is not a scientific theory; :#While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation. The creationists' methods do not take data, weigh it against the opposing scientific data, and thereafter reach the conclusions stated in [the Act] Instead, they take the literal wording of the Book of Genesis and attempt to find scientific support for it. The Act took a two-model approach to teaching identical to the approach put forward by the Institute for Creation Research, which assumes only two explanations for the origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the work of a creator or it was not. Creationists take this to mean that all scientific evidence which fails to support the theory of evolution is necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism. The judgment found this to be simply a contrived dualism which has no scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose. The judge concluded that \\"the Act was passed with the specific purpose by the General Assembly of advancing religion,\\" and that it violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. The test that Overton developed on the basis of Michael Ruse's testimony was later criticized by the philosopher of science Larry Laudan who argued that rather than call Creation Science \\"non-science\\" it would have been more cogent to show that it was \\"bad science\\". Chandra Wickramasinghe was the single scientist testifying for the defense of creationism.Phy-Olsen, Allene. Evolution, Creationism, and Intelligent Design He hypothesized on panspermia and on \\"the possibility of high intelligence in the Universe and of many increasing levels of intelligence converging toward a God as an ideal limit.\\" Fry, Iris.

The concerto consists of four movements and lasts approximately 20 minutes. It premiered in Weimar on February 17, 1855, with Liszt at the piano and Hector Berlioz conducting. History motive that is revisited several times. The main themes of Liszt's first piano concerto are written in a sketchbook dated 1830, when Liszt was nineteen years old. He seems to have completed the work in 1849, yet made further adjustments in 1853. It was first performed at Weimar in 1855, with the composer at the piano and Hector Berlioz conducting. Liszt made yet more changes before publication in 1856. B√©la Bart√≥k described it as \\"the first perfect realisation of cyclic sonata form, with common themes being treated on the variation principle\\". Description I. Allegro maestoso The concerto consists of four relatively short movements: =Allegro maestoso= The orchestra introduces the main theme of the piece with a powerful motif. It has been said that, to mock his critics, Liszt and his son-in-law, Hans von B√ºlow, put the words Das versteht ihr alle nicht, haha! (none of you understand this, ha-ha) to the notes of the opening two bars. The piano then comes in with an octave passage, spanning four octaves. A duet ensues between the piano and the clarinet in a quiet and peaceful passage, which is soon taken over again by the main theme. Following this, the piano plays fast, downward chromatic octaves, before recapitulating a section from earlier in the movement, this time in G major. The movement finishes with the main theme played by the strings while the piano imitates a harp with fast, quiet arpeggios, culminating with an upwards chromatic scale in sixths, diminishing to ppp volume. =Quasi adagio= The cellos and double basses introduce the Adagio section in a serene, unison cantabile, before the rest of the string section joins. Again, however, the cellos and double basses descend before the piano joins, in una corda. The piano uses the string theme and develops it further, playing in a nocturne-like style with soft, flowing left hand arpeggios and a cantabile melody in the right hand. The section reaches a climax where a strong fortissimo is played followed by a descending diminuendo scale. After a brief general pause, the whole orchestra resumes, again playing the same theme. Then a cello plays the theme while the piano answers hurriedly with a developmental recitative section. This leads into a passage where solos in the woodwind section play a new theme while the piano plays long trills in the right hand and spread chords in the left. The passage is ended by the piano and clarinet in duet. =Allegretto vivace ‚Äì Allegro animato= The triangle starts the movement with the string section following it. (The frequent and prominent use of the triangle lead the critic Eduard Hanslick to mock the work as a \\"Triangle Concerto\\".) The piano develops the theme further. This occurs throughout the whole movement, however previous themes from the last two movements are re-introduced and combined together to give this concerto its unique rhapsody-like form. This movement is decidedly jocular in character, with the performance direction at the start of the piano line of \\"capriccioso scherzando\\", and delicate, playful duets between the woodwind and piano occurring throughout. The second half of the movement, however, takes a darker turn, when the piano, after concluding the scherzo section, plays an eerie, tremolando passage in the lower registers, with a development of the first theme played above, at dynamic. After this, the downward chromatic octaves reappear, but this time at level, before the orchestra plays an ascending chromatic section, leading into a tonal recapitulation of the first theme. The movement ends with very similar music as the first movement begins, with a blistering piano passage ending in an F diminished seventh chord (r.h.: F‚ÄìA-flat‚ÄìD‚ÄìF). =Allegro marziale animato= A descending E-flat major scale is played before the orchestra plays the theme of the Adagio in thematic transformation. The piano follows this with a blistering solo octaves passage before joining in duet with various solo woodwind instruments in a dainty, lively section. The movement continues bringing in all the themes from throughout the concerto and combining them sequentially. In the final few passages, a new chromatic theme is introduced in which the piano is playing semiquavers and triplet quavers at the same time, an exercise in polyrhythm, while in unison with the strings. The piece ends in Liszt's bravura style, with the now-familiar downward chromatic octaves theme, played in this recapitulation at breakneck presto speed, before changing to contrary chromatic octaves, reaching the tonic key of E-flat major and dynamic. The orchestra alone has the last two notes, which Liszt carefully utilised to highlight the importance of the orchestra in the piece, not just as an accompanying device for the piano.

First, there is said to be the \\"purpose\\" approach or \\"mischief rule\\"... Then there is said to be the \\"literal\\" approach or \\"plain meaning\\" rule... Finally there is what is called the \\"golden rule\\"... Source: Elmer Driedger, Construction of Statutes. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 1. The other two are the \\"plain meaning rule\\" (also known as the \\"literal rule\\") and the \\"golden rule\\". The main aim of the rule is to determine the \\"mischief and defect\\" (lacuna also known as a non liquet) that the statute in question has set out to remedy, and what ruling would \\"suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy\\". In applying the mischief rule, the court is essentially asking what part of the law did the law not cover, but was meant to be rectified by Parliament in passing the bill. The rule was first set out in Heydon's Case, a 16th-century ruling of the Exchequer Court. Meaning and use In Conway v Rimmer it was observed that judges can apply in statutory interpretation in order to discover Parliament's intention. In applying the rule, the court is essentially asking what the mischief was that the previous law did not cover, which Parliament was seeking to remedy when it passed the law now being reviewed by the court. The mischief rule is of narrower application than the golden rule or the plain meaning rule, in that it can only be used to interpret a statute and, strictly speaking, only when the statute was passed to remedy a defect in the common law. Legislative intent is determined by examining secondary sources, such as committee reports, treatises, law review articles and corresponding statutes. The application of this rule gives the judge more discretion than the literal and the golden rule as it allows Parliament's intent to be taken into consideration. The way in which the mischief rule can produce more sensible outcomes than those that would result if the literal rule were applied is illustrated by the ruling in Smith v Hughes [1960] 2 All E.R. 859. Under the Street Offences Act 1959, it was a crime for prostitutes to \\"loiter or solicit in the street for the purposes of prostitution\\". The defendants were calling to men in the street from balconies and tapping on windows. They claimed they were not guilty as they were not \\"in the street\\". The judge applied the mischief rule to conclude that they were guilty as the intention of the act was to cover the mischief of harassment from prostitutes. History The rule was first set out in Heydon's Case [1584] 76 ER 637 3 CO REP 7a,http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Exch/1584/J36.htmlhttp://www.swarb.co.uk/lisc/LitiP12001799.php where the court held that four points should be taken into consideration: Traditional use In the century in which it was created, and for some time thereafter, the mischief rule was used in a legislative environment very different from the one which has prevailed in the past two centuries. As Elmer Driedger notes, Sixteenth-century common law judges looked upon statutes as a gloss upon the common law, even as an intrusion into their domain. Hence, statutes were viewed from the point of view of their effect upon the common law, as adding to it, subtracting from it or patching it up. Then also, in the time of Heydon's Case, the judges paid more attention to the \\"spirit\\" of the law than to the letter. Having found the mischief they proceeded to make mischief with the words of the statute. They remodelled the statute, by taking things out and putting things in, in order to fit the \\"mischief\\" and \\"defect\\" as they had found them.Elmer Driedger, The Construction of Statutes. Second Edition. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, pp. 74‚Äì75. Modern use Modern courts apply the rule in a more restricted manner, and generally with a greater regard for the integrity of the statutes which they are interpreting. Driedger puts it this way: \\"[T]o this day, Heydon's Case is frequently cited. The courts still look for the 'mischief' and 'remedy', but now use what they find as aids to discover the meaning of what the legislature has said rather than to change it\\". Elmer Driedger, The Construction of Statutes. Second Edition. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 75. Driedger goes on to argue that this modern use of the mischief rule ought to be understood as one of the components of what he characterized as the \\"modern\\" method of statutory construction, rather than a stand-alone rule serving (as it formerly had), as an alternative to the methods of construction proposed by the plain meaning rule and the golden rule.  Advantages  * In a common law jurisdiction, the existence of precedent and the knock-on effects of construing a statute prevent misuse of the rule * The Law Commission sees it as a far more satisfactory way of interpreting acts as opposed to the golden or literal rules * It usually avoids unjust or absurd results in sentencing * It is consistent with parliament sovereignty  Disadvantages  * It is seen to be out of date as it has been in use since the 16th century, when common law was the primary source of law and parliamentary supremacy was not established * It gives too much power to the unelected judiciary which is argued to be undemocratic * In the 16th century, the judiciary would often draft acts on behalf of the king and were therefore well qualified in what mischief the act was meant to remedy. This is not often the case in modern legal systems. * The rule can make the law uncertain See also * Letter and spirit of the law * Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart References Category:Legal history Category:English legal terminology Category:Common law rules ","title":"Mischief rule"},{"id":"2281368","text":"Endubis (c. 270 ‚Äì c. 300) was a King of the Kingdom of Aksum in East Africa (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea).

Another text window for a Unix shell is partially visible. In computing, a shell is a command-line interpreter which exposes access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system. Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, bash). Graphical shells place a low burden on beginning computer users, and are characterized as being easy to use. Since they also come with certain disadvantages, most GUI-enabled operating systems also provide CLI shells.  Overview  Operating systems provide various services to their users, including file management, process management (running and terminating applications), batch processing, and operating system monitoring and configuration. Most operating system shells are not direct interfaces to the underlying kernel, even if a shell communicates with the user via peripheral devices attached to the computer directly. Shells are actually special applications that use the kernel API in just the same way as it is used by other application programs. A shell manages the user-system interaction by prompting users for input, interpreting their input, and then handling an output from the underlying operating system (much like a read‚Äìeval‚Äìprint loop, REPL). Since the operating system shell is actually an application, it may easily be replaced with another similar application, for most operating systems. In addition to shells running on local systems, there are different ways to make remote systems available to local users; such approaches are usually referred to as remote access or remote administration. Initially available on multi-user mainframes, which provided text-based UIs for each active user simultaneously by means of a text terminal connected to the mainframe via serial line or modem, remote access has extended to Unix-like systems and Microsoft Windows. On Unix-like systems, Secure Shell protocol is usually used for text-based shells, while SSH tunneling can be used for X Window System-based graphical user interfaces (GUIs). On Microsoft Windows, Remote Desktop Protocol can be used to provide GUI remote access, and since Windows Vista, PowerShell Remote can be used for text-based remote access via WMI, RPC, and WS-Management. Most operating system shells fall into one of two categories command-line and graphical. Command line shells provide a command- line interface (CLI) to the operating system, while graphical shells provide a graphical user interface (GUI). Other possibilities, although not so common, include voice user interface and various implementations of a text-based user interface (TUI) that are not CLI. The relative merits of CLI- and GUI-based shells are often debated.  Command-line shells  Command Prompt, a CLI shell in Windows Bash, a widely adopted Unix shell A command-line interface (CLI) is an operating system shell that uses alphanumeric characters typed on a keyboard to provide instructions and data to the operating system, interactively. For example, a teletypewriter can send codes representing keystrokes to a command interpreter program running on the computer; the command interpreter parses the sequence of keystrokes and responds with an error message if it cannot recognize the sequence of characters, or it may carry out some other program action such as loading an application program, listing files, logging in a user and many others. Operating systems such as UNIX have a large variety of shell programs with different commands, syntax and capabilities, with the POSIX shell being a baseline. Some operating systems had only a single style of command interface; commodity operating systems such as MS-DOS came with a standard command interface (COMMAND.COM) but third-party interfaces were also often available, providing additional features or functions such as menuing or remote program execution. Application programs may also implement a command-line interface. For example, in Unix- like systems, the telnet program has a number of commands for controlling a link to a remote computer system. Since the commands to the program are made of the same keystrokes as the data being sent to a remote computer, some means of distinguishing the two are required. An escape sequence can be defined, using either a special local keystroke that is never passed on but always interpreted by the local system. The program becomes modal, switching between interpreting commands from the keyboard or passing keystrokes on as data to be processed. A feature of many command-line shells is the ability to save sequences of commands for re-use. A data file can contain sequences of commands which the CLI can be made to follow as if typed in by a user. Special features in the CLI may apply when it is carrying out these stored instructions. Such batch files (script files) can be used repeatedly to automate routine operations such as initializing a set of programs when a system is restarted. Batch mode use of shells usually involves structures, conditionals, variables, and other elements of programming languages; some have the bare essentials needed for such a purpose, others are very sophisticated programming languages in and of themselves. Conversely, some programming languages can be used interactively from an operating system shell or in a purpose-built program. The command-line shell may offer features such as command-line completion, where the interpreter expands commands based on a few characters input by the user. A command-line interpreter may offer a history function, so that the user can recall earlier commands issued to the system and repeat them, possibly with some editing. Since all commands to the operating system had to be typed by the user, short command names and compact systems for representing program options were common. Short names were sometimes hard for a user to recall, and early systems lacked the storage resources to provide a detailed on-line user instruction guide.  Graphical shells  A graphical user interface (GUI) provides means for manipulating programs graphically, by allowing for operations such as opening, closing, moving and resizing windows, as well as switching focus between windows. Graphical shells may be included with desktop environments or come separately, even as a set of loosely coupled utilities. Most graphical user interfaces develop the metaphor of an \\"electronic desktop\\", where data files are represented as if they were paper documents on a desk, and application programs similarly have graphical representations instead of being invoked by command names. = Unix-like systems = Drag and drop operation performed on a group of files between KDesktop and Konqueror in KDE Graphical shells typically build on top of a windowing system. In the case of X Window System or Wayland, the shell consists of an X window manager or a Wayland compositor, respectively, as well as of one or multiple programs providing the functionality to start installed applications, to manage open windows and virtual desktops, and often to support a widget engine. In the case of macOS, Quartz could be thought of as the windowing system, and the shell consists of the Finder, the Dock, SystemUIServer, and Mission Control. = Microsoft Windows = Modern versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system use the Windows shell as their shell. Windows Shell provides desktop environment, start menu, and task bar, as well as a graphical user interface for accessing the file management functions of the operating system. Older versions also include Program Manager, which was the shell for the 3.x series of Microsoft Windows, and which in fact shipped with later versions of Windows of both the 95 and NT types at least through Windows XP. The interfaces of Windows versions 1 and 2 were markedly different. Desktop applications are also considered shells, as long as they use a third-party engine. Likewise, many individuals and developers dissatisfied with the interface of Windows Explorer have developed software that either alters the functioning and appearance of the shell or replaces it entirely. WindowBlinds by StarDock is a good example of the former sort of application. LiteStep and Emerge Desktop are good examples of the latter. Interoperability programmes and purpose-designed software lets Windows users use equivalents of many of the various Unix-based GUIs discussed below, as well as Macintosh. An equivalent of the OS/2 Presentation Manager for version 3.0 can run some OS/2 programmes under some conditions using the OS/2 environmental subsystem in versions of Windows NT.  Other uses  \\"Shell\\" is also used loosely to describe application software that is \\"built around\\" a particular component, such as web browsers and email clients, in analogy to the shells found in nature. These are also sometimes referred to as \\"wrappers\\". In expert systems, a shell is a piece of software that is an \\"empty\\" expert system without the knowledge base for any particular application.

The database server component of the software platform retains its historical name TM1. Data is stored in in-memory multidimensional OLAP cubes, generally at the \\"leaf\\" level, and consolidated on demand. In addition to data, cubes can include encoded rules which define any on-demand calculations. By design, computations (typically aggregation along dimensional hierarchies using weighted summation) on the data are performed in near real-time, without the need to precalculate, due to a highly performant database design and calculation engine. These properties also allow the data to be updated frequently and by multiple users. TM1 is an example of a class of software products which implement the principles of the functional database model. The IBM Planning Analytics platform, in addition to the TM1 database server, includes an ETL tool, server management and monitoring tools and a number of user front ends which provide capabilities designed for common business planning and budgeting requirements, including workflow, adjustments, commentary, etc. The vendor currently offers the software both as a standalone on-premise product and in the SaaS model on the cloud.  History  While working at Exxon, Lilly Whaley suggested developing a planning system using the IBM mainframe time sharing option (TSO) to replace the previous IMS based planning system and thereby significantly reduce running costs. Manuel \\"Manny\\" Perez, who had been in IT for most of his career, took it upon himself to develop a prototype. Right away he realized that in order to provide the multidimensionality and interactivity necessary it would be necessary to keep the data structures in computer memory rather than on disk. The business potential of the planning system Perez had developed became apparent to him and he began to explore the possibilities of commercializing it. Back in early 1981, the IBM personal computer had not yet been announced and the Apple II¬Æ was not in significant use at corporations, so initially, Perez looked to implement on a public mainframe timesharing system. Just in time, the IBM personal computer was announced. It provided a low cost development environment which Manny was quick to take advantage of. When Visicalc was released, Perez became convinced that it was the ideal user interface for his visionary product: the Functional Database. With his friend Jose Sinai formed the Sinper Corporation in early 1983 and released his initial product, TM/1 (the \\"TM\\" in TM1 stands for \\"Table Manager\\"). Sinper was purchased by Applix in 1996, which was purchased by Cognos in late 2007, which was in itself acquired mere months later by IBM. With its flagship TM1 product line, Applix was the purest OLAP vendor among publicly traded independent BI vendors prior to OLAP industry consolidation in 2007, and had the greatest growth rate. On December 16, 2016 IBM released a rebranded and expanded version of the software (IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 'powered by' IBM TM1) with a 'restarted' version numbering.

The club were members of the Football League for three seasons in the mid 1890s. In 1901 they merged with Burton Swifts to form Burton United. The club played at Derby Turn. History Founded in 1871, the club was amongst the founder members of the Midland League in 1890. In the 1893‚Äì94 season, they finished as champions despite a points deduction for fielding an ineligible player, and were elected to the Second Division of the Football League. However, the club did not last long in the League, and at the end of the 1896‚Äì97 season, after finishing second last in the League, they were voted out. In their time in the Second Division, Burton Wanderers beat Newcastle United 9‚Äì0, which remains Newcastle's worst league defeat. The club then rejoined the Midland League, and, after finishing in bottom place in 1901, merged with neighbouring Burton Swifts (who were still members of the Football League) to form Burton United. The new club took Swifts' place in the League and played their home games at the Swifts' Peel Croft ground. Ground During their existence Burton Wanderers played their home games at Derby Turn and their record attendance was 6,000 for an FA Cup second round match against Notts County on 10 February 1894.

CD34 derives its name from the cluster of differentiation protocol that identifies cell surface antigens. CD34 was first described on hematopoietic stem cells independently by Civin et al. and Tindle et al. as a cell surface glycoprotein and functions as a cell- cell adhesion factor. It may also mediate the attachment of hematopoietic stem cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells. Clinically, it is associated with the selection and enrichment of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow transplants. Due to these historical and clinical associations, CD34 expression is almost ubiquitously related to hematopoietic cells however it is actually found on many other cell types as well.  Function  The CD34 protein is a member of a family of single-pass transmembrane sialomucin proteins that show expression on early hematopoietic and vascular-associated tissue. However, little is known about its exact function. CD34 is also an important adhesion molecule and is required for T cells to enter lymph nodes. It is expressed on lymph node endothelia, whereas the L-selectin to which it binds is on the T cell. Conversely, under other circumstances CD34 has been shown to act as molecular \\"Teflon\\" and block mast cell, eosinophil and dendritic cell precursor adhesion, and to facilitate opening of vascular lumina. Finally, recent data suggest CD34 may also play a more selective role in chemokine-dependent migration of eosinophils and dendritic cell precursors. Regardless of its mode of action, under all circumstances CD34, and its relatives podocalyxin and endoglycan, facilitates cell migration.  Tissue distribution  Cells expressing CD34 (CD34+ cell) are normally found in the umbilical cord and bone marrow as hematopoietic cells, or in mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, endothelial cells of blood vessels but not lymphatics (except pleural lymphatics), mast cells, a sub-population of dendritic cells (which are factor XIIIa-negative) in the interstitium and around the adnexa of dermis of skin, as well as cells in soft tissue tumors like DFSP, GIST, SFT, HPC, and to some degree in MPNSTs, etc. The presence of CD34 on non-hematopoietic cells in various tissues has been linked to progenitor and adult stem cell phenotypes. It is important to mention that Long-Term Hematopoietic Stem Cells (LT-HSCs) in mice and humans are the hematopoietic cells with the greatest self-renewal capacity. Human HSCs express the CD34 marker. CD34 is expressed in roughly 20% of murine hematopoietic stem cells, and can be stimulated and reversed.  Clinical applications  CD34+ is often used clinically to quantify the number of haemopoietic stem cells for use in haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. This is generally a useful marker for cell dosing although there is some evidence that the CD34+ quantification may not be reliable in some circumstances. CD34+ cells may be isolated from blood samples using immunomagnetic and used for CD34+ transplants, which have lower rates of graft versus host disease.{doi=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2018.01.001} Antibodies are used to quantify and purify hematopoietic progenitor stem cells for research and for clinical bone marrow transplantation. However, counting CD34+ mononuclear cells may overestimate myeloid blasts in bone marrow smears due to hematogones (B lymphocyte precursors) and CD34+ megakaryocytes. Cells observed as CD34+ and CD38- are of an undifferentiated, primitive form; i.e., they are multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, because of their CD34+ expression, such undifferentiated cells can be sorted out. In tumors, CD34 is found in alveolar soft part sarcoma, preB-ALL (positive in 75%), AML (40%), AML-M7 (most), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, giant cell fibroblastoma, granulocytic sarcoma, Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, meningeal hemangiopericytomas, meningiomas, neurofibromas, schwannomas, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. A negative CD34 may exclude Ewing's sarcoma/PNET, myofibrosarcoma of the breast, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors of the stomach. Injection of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells has been clinically applied to treat various diseases including spinal cord injury, liver cirrhosis and peripheral vascular disease.  Interactions  CD34 has been shown to interact with CRKL. It also interacts with L-selectin, important in inflammation.

The rule can be used to avoid the consequences of a literal interpretation of the wording of a statute when such an interpretation would lead to a manifest absurdity or to a result that is obnoxious to principles of public policy. The rule can be applied in two different ways, named respectively the narrower approach and the wider approach. History In Becke v Smith (1836) Parke, J (later Lord Wensleydale) stated: > It is a very useful rule in the construction of a statute, to adhere to the > ordinary meaning of the words used, and to the grammatical construction, > unless that is at variance with the intention of the legislature, to be > collected from the statute itself, or leads to any manifest absurdity or > repugnance, in which case the language may be varied or modified, to avoid > such inconvenience, but no farther. Twenty years later, Lord Wensleydale restated the rule in different words in the House of Lords case Grey v Pearson (1857): > [I]n construing wills, and indeed statutes and all written instruments, the > grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that > would lead to absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of > the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the > words may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity or inconsistency, but no > further. Narrower approach The rule may be applied in the narrower sense where there is some ambiguity or absurdity in the words themselves. In the leading case of R v Allen (1872), the defendant was charged with bigamy under Section 57 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 which made it an offence to marry while one's spouse is still alive and not divorced. The court held that the word 'marry' could not in that context mean 'become legally married' since that could never apply to someone who is already married to someone else. To make sense of the provision, the word should be interpreted as meaning to 'go through a second ceremony of marriage'. Wider approach In its wider sense the rule may be used to avoid a result that is obnoxious to principles of public policy, even where words may prima facie carry only one meaning. The rule was applied in this sense in In re Sigsworth (1935) in the context of the Administration of Estates Act 1925. A man had murdered his mother and then committed suicide. Under the plain terms of section 46, as the woman had died intestate her murderer stood to inherit substantially her entire estate, which would then have passed to his descendants. This was challenged by other members of the woman's family. The court used the golden rule to find in favour of the family, preventing the son's descendants as a matter of public policy from profiting from his crime. The rule as applied in that particular case has subsequently been put onto a statutory footing in the Forfeiture Act 1982 and the Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011. The leading case on the wider approach is Adler v George (1964) in which the defendant was charged with obstructing a military guard in the execution of his duty. To succeed, the prosecution had to show that the act took place 'in the vicinity of' a military establishment. The defendant argued that 'in the vicinity' meant 'outside or in the proximity or area' of the establishment, whereas he was inside the establishment. The court decided that such an interpretation would lead to an absurd result, and interpreted 'in the vicinity of' to cover a person already on the premises.

In medicine, it refers to excess oxygen in the lungs or other body tissues, which can be caused by breathing air or oxygen at pressures greater than normal atmospheric pressure. This kind of hyperoxia can lead to oxygen toxicity, caused from the harmful effects of breathing molecular oxygen at elevated partial pressures. Hyperoxia is the opposite of hypoxia; hyperoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is excessive, and hypoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is insufficient. In the environment, it refers to excess oxygen in a body of water or other habitat. Signs and symptoms Associated with hyperoxia is an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. These oxygen containing molecules can damage lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and react with surrounding biological tissues. The human body has naturally occurring antioxidants to combat reactive molecules, but the protective antioxidant defenses can become depleted by abundant reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidation of the tissues and organs. The symptoms produced from breathing high concentrations of oxygen for extended periods have been studied in a variety of animals, such as frogs, turtles, pigeons, mice, rats, guinea pigs, cats, dogs and monkeys. The majority of these studies reported the occurrence of irritation, congestion and edema of the lungs, and even death following prolonged exposures. =Oxygen toxicity= The supplementation of oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity, also known as oxygen toxicity syndrome, oxygen intoxication, and oxygen poisoning. There are two main types of oxygen toxicity: central nervous system toxicity (CNS), and pulmonary and ocular toxicity. Temporary exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure can lead to central nervous system toxicity (CNS). An early but serious sign of CNS oxygen toxicity is a grand-mal seizure, also known as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This type of seizure consists of a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. Signs and symptoms of oxygen toxicity are usually prevalent, but there are no standard warning signs that a seizure is about to ensue. The convulsion caused by oxygen toxicity does not lead to hypoxia, a side effect common to most seizures, because the body has an excess amount of oxygen when the convulsion begins. The seizures can lead to drowning, however, if the convulsion is suffered by a diver still in the water. Prolonged exposure to higher oxygen levels at atmospheric pressure can lead to pulmonary and ocular toxicity. Symptoms of oxygen toxicity may include disorientation, respiratory problems, or myopia. Prolonged exposure to higher than normal partial pressures of oxygen can result in oxidative damage to cell membranes. Signs of pulmonary (lung) oxygen toxicity begin with slight irritation in the trachea. A mild cough usually ensues, followed by greater irritation and a worse cough until breathing becomes quite painful and the cough becomes uncontrollable. If supplementation of oxygen is continued, the individual will notice tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and if exposure is continued, fatality due to lack of oxygen. Cause Oxygen supplied at greater than atmospheric pressure has been known to damage plants, animals, and aerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli. The damaging effects vary depending on the specimen used, its age, physiological state, and diet. The supplementation of oxygen has been a common procedure of prehospital treatment for many years. Guidelines include cautions about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These guidelines stress the use of 28% oxygen masks and caution the dangers of hyperoxia. Long-term use of supplemental oxygen improves survival in patients with COPD, but can lead to lung injury. An additional cause of hyperoxia is related to underwater diving with breathing apparatus. Underwater divers breath a mixture of gasses which must include oxygen, and the partial pressure of any given gas mixture will increase with depth. A mixture known as nitrox is used to reduce the risk of decompression sickness by substituting oxygen for part of the nitrogen content. Breathing nitrox can lead to hyperoxia due to the high partial pressure of oxygen if used too deep or for too long. Protocols for the safe use of raised oxygen partial pressure in diving are well established and used routinely by recreational scuba divers, military combat divers and professional saturation divers alike. The highest risk of hyperoxia is in hyperbaric oxygen therapy, where it is a high probability side effect of the treatment for more serious conditions, and is considered an acceptable risk as it can be managed effectively without apparent long term effects. DiagnosisTreatment Oxygen supplementation is used to treat tissue hypoxia and to relieve arterial hypoxemia. High concentrations of oxygen are often given to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or acute lung injury (ALI). Supplementing oxygen is known to cause tissue damage, with toxicity increasing with the increase of oxygen concentrations and exposure pressures. Unfortunately, the supplementation of oxygen is necessary if an individual is not able to obtain sufficient oxygen through respiration and perfusion. To decrease the chances of hyperoxia, the therapist should use the lowest concentration of oxygen required by an individual. At this time, there are no known alternatives to oxygen supplementation.

Traditionally, Maldivians call this atoll simply 'Faadhippolhu', without adding the word 'Atholhu' at the end. This is done only with the names of some atolls. In the early 12th century, during the reign of King Koimala Siri Mahaabarana Mahaa Radun- the first king to rule over all the Maldive islands- this atoll was called Faadu Bur.

They are not the proper names of the natural atolls that make up these divisions. Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls. The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view.

The film stars Ian Michael Smith, Joseph Mazzello, Jim Carrey, Ashley Judd and Oliver Platt. It omitted much of the latter half of the novel and altered the ending. The film does not share the book's title at Irving's request; he did not believe that his novel could successfully be made into a film. The name \\"Simon Birch\\" was suggested by him to replace that of Owen Meany. The opening credits of the film state that it was \\"suggested by\\" Irving's novel. The main plot centers on 12-year-old Joe Wenteworth and his best friend Simon Birch, who was born with dwarfism.  Plot  On an autumn morning, an adult Joe Wentworth (Jim Carrey) visits the grave of his childhood friend Simon Birch and narrates Simon's story as the film transitions to the 1960s. In 1964, Simon was the smallest newborn in the history of Gravestown. Nobody believed that he would survive, but Simon believed he was a legitimate miracle. Simon loved baseball despite that he almost never got to play, and when he did it was only to get a walk from his small strike zone. Joe's mother, Rebecca Wentworth, got pregnant in high school. The only fact anyone knows about Joe's parentage is that Rebecca met his father on a train. Her refusal to reveal the identity of the father has made Joe a living town scandal. Simon is obsessed with how long he can hold his breath underwater, always trying to improve this ability. One day Rebecca invites for dinner a man she met on the train, Ben Goodrich, a drama teacher. He meets Joe and Simon and brings a stuffed armadillo for Joe. Simon doesn't believe that the niceties of church are necessary. He says, in front of the congregation, that if God has made these things a priority, they are in trouble. Sunday School teacher Leavey belittles him, telling him that he doesn't belong in church and his belief that God has a special plan for him is ridiculous. While playing baseball, Simon Birch is given the perfect pitch, and hits it. It soon becomes a foul ball that hits Rebecca in the head, immediately killing her. Simon gives Joe his most prized possession, his baseball cards, as an apology. Simon and Joe have an argument, with Simon claiming that everything he does is foreordained. Joe disagrees, saying that his mother's death was an accident. Joe's grandmother informs him that there must be a plan should she die, as Rebecca never told anyone who Joe's father was, even in confidence. Joe decides his only hope is to find his real father. Joe and Simon believe that Joe's father may have taken the baseball. They break into the gym teacher's office to find if he has the baseball that killed Rebecca, as that would implicate him as Joe's father. It isn't there, and Joe vandalizes the office, believing that he will never find his real father. The police chief agrees to let them off if they go to the children's retreat over their winter break. Ben picks them up from the police station and takes them for ice cream. Simon informs Ben of his destiny to be a hero, but admits that he doesn't know what that will imply. However, he fears that it could happen at any time, and he could miss it. A Christmas pageant with a Nativity play is organized by the Sunday School and the children are chosen for their parts. Margerie, the school's prettiest girl, is chosen to play Mary; Howard is playing the angel despite his crippling fear of heights; and Simon is the baby Jesus, as he is the only one who fits in the manger. Simon agrees when he realizes that he will be able to stay next to Margerie for the entire play. Simon helps another child tame his fear and mentions that children listen to him because of how he looks. However, the play becomes a disaster; the turtle doves look like winged mutant turtles, the wise men cannot remember the words to \\"We Three Kings\\", and Howard is so scared he forgets his lines. But when Simon, incited by seeing Marjorie's cleavage, advances on her sexually, she hits Joe, knocking the wind out of him, and Howard vomits on the stage. As a result of the pageant chaos, Simon is not allowed on the retreat and his baseball cards are taken away. However, he breaks into the reverend's office to get them back, inadvertently finding the fateful baseball implicating the man as Joe's father. Simon has Ben drive him to the retreat to inform Joe. Reverend Russell admits this to Joe at the retreat, just as Simon arrives with the baseball. While Simon and Joe are riding the bus home, it crashes into a lake. When the bus driver abandons the children, and the reverend is knocked unconscious, Simon takes command to get everyone out safely. With the help of Joe, he is successful getting everyone out of the bus, but Simon nearly drowns in saving the last child. Joe wakes up in the hospital and visits Simon, who is dying. Simon mentions that the children listened to him because of how he looks, that the window he escaped through was \\"just his size\\" and that he held his breath for \\"200 Mississippi\\", then dies. Joe remarks that he will always remember Simon for the hero that he was. Joe's grandmother dies that summer, and he is adopted by Ben Goodrich just before his 15th birthday. The film then transitions back to the present day with adult Joe at Simon Birch's grave. Joe's son, who is named after Simon Birch, reminds him he has a soccer game, and they drive away.  Cast  * Ian Michael Smith as Simon Birch: This was Smith's first role in film, and he has not done film acting since. He was chosen because of his small height, due to Morquio syndrome. His role in this film was suggested by a hospital worker in Chicago. After his parents read through the novel (A Prayer for Owen Meany) they agreed to let him work on the film. * Joseph Mazzello as Joe Wenteworth * Jim Carrey as Adult Joe Wenteworth / Narrator * Ashley Judd as Rebecca Wenteworth; Sandra Bullock was originally cast for the role Ashley Judd was given. * Oliver Platt as Ben Goodrich * David Strathairn as Reverend Russell * Dana Ivey as Grandmother Wenteworth * Beatrice Winde as Hilde Grove * Jan Hooks as Miss Agnes Leavey * Cecilley Carroll as Marjorie * Sumela-Rose Keramidopulos as Ann * Sam Morton as Stuart * John Mazzello as Simon Wenteworth * Holly Dennison as Mrs. Birch * Peter MacNeill as Mr. Birch * Thomas J. Burns as Simon Birch Stunt Double  Production  The bus crash scene was filmed near Ontario's French River. The film's quarry scenes were shot at Elora, Ontario. The church featured in many parts of the film is in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Its black borders were painted white for the film. At the end of the film when it switches to the future, the borders are black. The baseball scene as well as many indoor scenes were filmed in Glen Williams, Ontario.  Soundtrack  Simon Birch features R&B; songs from the 1950 and 1960s, as well as four score cues by Marc Shaiman.

It has both normative and descriptive senses. Normative Normatively, the phrase may describe the effort to suit one's rhetoric to the widest possible audience, without losing relevant information in the process. Advocates of normative linguistic transparency often argue that linguistic opacity is dangerous to a democracy. These critics point out that jargon is deliberately employed in government and business. It encrypts morally suspect information in order to dull reaction to it: for example, the phrase \\"collateral damage\\" to refer to the manslaughter of innocents. One play upon this view was by William Strunk, Jr. and E. B. White, who in the Elements of Style ruled that the writer ought to \\"eschew obfuscation\\". The Plain Language Movement is an example of people who advocate using clearer, common language within the wider academic community. Professor at New York University Alan Sokal, perpetrator of the Sokal hoax, is another noteworthy example of an advocate of linguistic transparency. Writer and political philosopher George Orwell was a proponent of this view, which he captured in the landmark essay, \\"Politics and the English Language.\\" Orwell wrote a novel, 1984, about a dystopian future controlled through a politically crafted language called \\"Newspeak.\\" Newspeak is a language that is linguistically transparent in the descriptive sense, but not in the normative one. Comedian George Carlin has famously parodied the phenomenon in his stand-up comedy. The approach may sound like common sense, but it faces the difficulty of figuring out how to communicate complex and uncommon ideas in a popular way. Descriptive=Definition= In the field of lexical semantics, semantic transparency (in adjective form: semantically transparent) is a measure of the degree to which the meaning of a multimorphemic combination can be synchronically related to the meaning of its constituents. Semantic transparency is a scalar notion. At the top end of the scale are combinations whose meaning is fully transparent; at the bottom end are said to be semantically opaque (in noun form: semantic opacity).Sch√§fer, Martin. (2018).

Background Irish support for the Boers can be traced back to 1877 when several Irish parliamentarians, such as Charles Stewart Parnell, opposed laws to annex the South African Republic under British rule. Although the annexation was successful, many Irishmen continued to show support for the Boers during the First Anglo-Boer War; especially in 1881 following the British defeat at the Battle of Majuba Hill where an Irishman Alfred Aylward served as an adviser to the Boer General Piet Joubert during the battle. When rumours of a second war with the Boers began to surface, protesters led by James Connolly took to the streets in Dublin in August 1899 and public meetings were held across Ireland in support of the Boers. Several weeks later in Dublin a crowd of nearly twenty thousand marched in protests against the planned invasion of the South African Republic. However, the reality of war followed from President Kruger's ultimatum of 9 October 1899, in which he gave the British government 48 hours to comply, and when they did not he declared war on Britain on 11 October. The Irish Transvaal Brigade was established days before the outbreak of the 2nd Anglo-Boer war and initially consisted of Irishmen who worked in the Witwatersrand. These volunteers were given full citizenship and became Burghers of the Boer republics. The brigade was formed by Col.John Y.F.Blake a former officer in the U.S. Army and succeeded by John Macbride. Under the leadership of Macbride, the brigade was strengthened by volunteers travelling from Ireland via Delagoa Bay into South Africa. Irish American Volunteers Recruitment of volunteers for the Boer cause were supported by representatives of the New York United Irish Societies during a time when Dutch Americans organized to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of the Boers. Fifty-eight men of the Irish American Ambulance Corps traveled from Chicago to New York City where they were welcomed as heroes for the purpose of joining the Boer war effort. In South Africa, upon their arrival in April 1900, they were welcomed by fellow Irish American John Y.F. Blake where after they removed their Red Cross arm bands and joined the Irish Transvaal Brigade. The two Irish Americans, Michael O'Hara and Edward Egan who died in battle were described as \\"New Martyrs to Liberty\\" by the American press. Irish Transvaal Brigade The Irish Transvaal Brigade, also known as the Wreckers' Corps, was organised by John MacBride, who was then employed at the Band Mines. Most of the Company-strength Brigade were Irish or Irish-American miners living in the Transvaal who were willing to fight with the Boers against the British. The Brigade was bolstered during its campaign by a contingent of volunteers who came from Chicago and by a variety of Irish volunteers who travelled from America and Ireland for the purposes of joining the Brigade. Irishmen who enlisted in the British Army also fought in the Boer War, which symbolised one of many moments in Irish history in which Irishmen had divided loyalties. That ultimately led to them fighting each other. John MacBride wrote his own account of the Irish Transvaal Brigade, which can found in Anthony J. Jordan's edited version of the writings of MacBride.Anthony J. Jordan, Boer War to Easter Rising: The Writings of John MacBride, Westport Books 2006. The Brigade would come to be known as MacBride's Brigade, after their commander, John MacBride. It was operational from September 1899 to September 1900, when the brigade fought in about 20 engagements, with 18 men killed and about 70 wounded from a complement of no more than about 300 men at any one time. When it disbanded, most of the men crossed into Mozambique, which was a colony of neutral Portugal. Colonel John Y. F. Blake, a former US Army officer was the brigade's commander. When he was wounded, his second-in- command, Major John MacBride, took command. Prior to the Siege of Ladysmith, the commandos were involved in guarding the artillery under Carolus Johannes Trichardt. The brigade also provided signal service at the Battle of Modderspruit. At the Siege of Ladysmith, they serviced the famous Boer artillery piece, called Long Tom, and they fought at the Battle of Colenso. Having worked in the gold mines, they had a well-deserved reputation as demolition experts. They delayed the British advance on Pretoria by blowing up bridges. The brigade disbanded after the Battle of Bergendal. The brigade received letters of thanks before they left South Africa from State Secretary F. W. Reitz, Comdant-General Louis Botha and General Barend Viljoen. Second commando The Second Irish Brigade was formed in January 1900 by former members of the Irish Transvaal Brigade. Former Le Journal correspondent Arthur Lynch was appointed as the unit's commander. The brigade consisted of 150 commandos from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Including among others Irish, Australian, Greek, German, Boer and Italian members. The brigade remained attached to General Lukas Meyer's command in Natal, retiring to Laing's Nek after the siege of Ladysmith. The brigade fought in the rear guard, during the retreat from Ladysmith to Glencoe. The brigade was later ordered to Vereeniging but was disbanded while it was in Johannesburg. After the dissolution of the brigade, Lynch together with a small group of Irishmen joined various commandos along the Vaal River.  See also  * Boer foreign volunteers References=Sources= *Anthony J.

The studios are located in the College of Communication on the campus of Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. WGLS-FM is Gloucester County's only FM radio station. WGLS's programming features a variety of music, sports, cultural, educational programs focused towards the interest of the Rowan University and South Jersey communities. The call letters for WGLS hearken back to the former name of the institution: W GLassboro State College. The station has won numerous local and national awards, including being named \\"College Station of the Year\\" by the National Association of College Broadcasters in 1997. History Glassboro State College was granted a construction permit by the FCC to build a low watt FM radio station on the campus on May 17, 1963 and a broadcast license was issued the following year on April 9, 1964.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=70395 89.7 WGLS-FM went on the air with funding provided by the college's Library Department. The library's Educational Media Director William McCavitt served as the first faculty supervisor of the 10-watt mono radio station until 1966. He left Glassboro State and went on to establish two more college stations, WIUP-FM for Indiana University of Pennsylvania and WCUC-FM at Clarion University located in Clarion, Pennsylvania. Other faculty members continued to advise the students of WGLS, including 1967 supervisor George Reinfeld, who would eventually help establish the college's Department of Communication. Joe Salviuolo was the station's advisor in 1968, but ultimately left academia to become a songwriter, producer and manager. Under the stage name \\"Sal Joseph\\", he collaborated with popular folk artist Jim Croce on the hit, \\"Thursday\\". Dr. Gregory Potter, from the GSC Library Department, took over management of WGLS in 1969, and successfully led the effort to update the college's radio studio in the campus‚Äô Bole Hall building, as well as correcting various engineering and transmission issues. By 1970, the school's Library Department relinquished control of WGLS to the Department of Fine and Performing Arts. Dean Armand Vorce and advisor Bob Blake kept WGLS broadcasting until 1973, when it was decided that the radio station's broadcast license would be released back to the FCC due to management and operational concerns. Student Station Manager Jim Servino successfully petitioned Glassboro State's then president Dr. Mark Chamberlain to keep the license, and to allow the students to manage WGLS on their own. Servino and students enlisted the help of Communications professor Mike Donovan to help consult the radio station. WGLS then lobbied for an estimated $70,000 in funding from the school's Student Government Association for technical upgrades. The station moved across campus to Savitz Library, a new 50-foot tower was erected, and the transmitter power increased from 10 watts to 440 watts. By 1977, WGLS moved to larger studio space within Savitz Library and began to broadcast in stereo. Following the tenure of station advisors Mike Donovan (1973 to 1988) and Phylis Johnson (1988 to 1990), the college decided that a dedicated full-time Station Manager was needed in order for WGLS-FM to grow. Former WFIL-AM broadcaster Frank Hogan assumed the newly created role in 1991. At the time, Hogan was serving Glassboro State College as a ¬æ time radio professor, having previously worked as the engineering consultant on the station's 1977 stereo and studio upgrades. With the 1992 name change of Glassboro State College to Rowan University due to a $100 million donation from industrialist Henry Rowan, WGLS-FM re-branded itself as \\"Rowan Radio\\". The station's antenna moved to the Glassboro city water tower in 1993, and the increased height boosted the station's power to an effective radiated power of 640 watts. In 1995, Rowan Radio 89.7 WGLS-FM evolved from a student radio club into a permanently incorporated aspect of the newly created College of Communication and Creative Arts. WGLS-FM moved again into its fourth studio home on campus inside the then recently expanded Bozorth Hall building January 1996. Rowan Radio began streaming over the internet in 2000. In January 2001, the station's transmitter was relocated 9 miles off campus to a 500-foot tower in South Harrison Twp., NJ, again increasing its signal strength to an ERP of 750 watts. Sports broadcaster and college instructor Derek Jones succeeded Frank Hogan upon his retirement in 2012. Programming Rowan Radio 89.7 WGLS-FM since its inception in 1964 has maintained a \\"variety\\" format in its programming choices, which reflect FCC guidelines regarding the need for licensed radio stations to operate in the public interest and serve their communities. The mixed variety format also allows WGLS‚Äô student broadcasters to experience all kinds of radio programming as part of their studies. WGLS-FM's broadcast schedule employs the theories of \\"horizontal programming\\" and \\"dayparting\\". Implemented by station manager Frank Hogan in 1991, Rowan Radio's programming schedule consists of daily music and talk shows airing at the same time weekdays with specialized niche programming on the weekends. Regular programming is sometimes pre-empted for the station's seasonal coverage of Rowan University Division III athletic games. Rowan Radio's current weekday programming schedule includes: * 7a-9a The Early Bird Special Morning Show * 9a-5p The Music That Matters (Classic Hits Format) * 5p-6p Public Affairs & News/Sports Talk * 6p-8p Pop Flavor (CHR, Top 40 Format) * 8p-12a Rowan Radio Rock (Modern, Alternative, Classic Rock Format) * 12a-7a Overnight Flight (Progressive Rock Format) Weekend Programming consists of more niche programming selections highlighting music from genres such as Broadway, Classical, Oldies, and Metal. Weekend shows include \\"The 80s Arcade\\", \\"The Icon Rock Show\\", \\"Satin Nights\\", \\"Saturday Night At The Oldies\\", \\"Sunday Sounds Of Music\\", \\"The Sunday Matinee\\" and more. Public Affairs programming is produced by university students, instructors and civic leaders discussing a variety of local and national topics. Shows and podcasts include: * \\"A Community Affair\\" * \\"The African American Profile\\" * \\"The American Dream\\" * \\"Your Health Matters\\" * \\"Studio 89.7\\" * \\"The ARC Report\\" (produced in association with The ARC of Gloucester County, NJ) * \\"Everything Special Needs\\" * \\"Career Talk\\" * \\"Writers Roundtable\\" * \\"The Rowan Sport Review\\" * \\"The Rowan Report\\" * \\"Offsides\\" Awards Since its incorporation with Rowan University's College of Communication in 1995, 89.7 WGLS-FM has won over 300 broadcasting awards in local and national contests. WGLS won \\"College Station of the Year\\" in 1997 from the National Association of College Broadcasters. The college station has won numerous accolades for its various programming including honors from the Gracie Awards, The Broadcast Education Association, The Communicator Awards, College Broadcasters, Inc., The Philadelphia Press Association and The New Jersey Broadcasters Association.

History On July 6, 1948, the Federal Communications Commission granted Broadcast Management, Inc. a construction permit for a new FM station on 103.1 MHz with the WBCG-FM call sign. On October 18, 1950, the FCC reassigned the station to 106.3 MHz, modifying the construction permit. The FCC granted the station its first license on June 29, 1951. On September 28, 1951, the station's call sign was changed to WUST-FM. The station's license was voluntarily transferred to WUST, Inc. on September 10, 1958, with an effective date of October 17, 1958. On January 28, 1959, the FCC granted WUST, Inc. a construction permit to change the station's frequency to 94.7 MHz. The permit allowed the station to increase its effective radiated power (ERP) to 20,000 watts while decreasing the height above average terrain (HAAT) to 245 feet. The station's call sign was changed on April 5, 1960 to WJMD. The FCC granted a new license with the updated facilities on October 1, 1960. The station's license was modified by the FCC on November 30, 1960 to reflect a change in the owner's name to Atlantic Broadcasting Company. The station aired a beautiful music format. The WJMD call sign was formed from the initials of the previous owners, the Diener brothers (Walter, Jack, Mickey and Dan). The FCC granted Atlantic Broadcasting Company a construction permit on November 25, 1968, allowing an increase in ERP to 50,000 watts and an increase in HAAT to 301 feet (later modified to 309 feet). On January 4, 1970, the FCC granted a voluntary reassignment of the station's license to San Juan Racing Association, Inc. The FCC granted the new owners a new license for the station with the upgraded facilities on August 13, 1970, followed by another voluntary reassignment of the license to SJR Communications, Inc. effective December 31, 1970. During the 1970s, SJR Communications changed the station's ERP and HAAT several times. On August 16, 1973, SJR Communications filed a construction permit with the FCC to decrease the station's ERP to 24,000 watts while increasing the station's HAAT to 670 feet. The permit was modified on May 24, 1974 to 17,000 watts ERP and 776 feet HAAT. The FCC then granted a new license with these facilities on June 18, 1975. SJR Communications was granted another construction permit on November 18, 1976 to increase the station's ERP to 21,000 watts and its HAAT to 780 feet. The FCC then granted a new license following these changes on March 15, 1978. WJMD evolved into a soft adult contemporary music format with a change of call sign to WLTT in March 1982. Under this format, the station was branded as \\"W-Lite\\". The format would last for the next 11 years. WLTT dropped the soft adult contemporary music format on November 19, 1993, in favor of a classic rock music format branded as \\"The Arrow\\". A change of call sign followed to WARW to complement the change in branding to \\"The Arrow\\". WARW was also billed on-air as \\"We Always Rock Washington.\\" =94.7 The Globe/Classic Rock 94.7= On February 2, 2007, an adult album alternative (also known as \\"triple A\\") music format was adopted with the branding \\"The Globe\\". The new \\"Globe\\" format also featured \\"green\\" segments between songs or before and after commercials with environmental information. These segments are called \\"The Green Scene\\". The station's call sign changed to WTGB on February 15. The airstaff remained the same as WARW's, but some spots were flipped. Weasel moved from nights to mornings, displacing the Stevens & Medley morning team. Mark Stevens, who was part of Stevens & Medley, moved to nights and was eventually replaced by Albie Dee, who would later move to mornings, replacing Weasel, in November 2008, two months after WTGB flipped back to their prior classic rock format. Jerry Hoyt would then take over evenings. The February 2007 shift to Triple-A left rival classic hits station WBIG-FM as the capital's only analog station broadcasting some form of classic rock. The Globe's HD2 subchannel, then known as \\"The Jam\\", began broadcasting a mixture of classic rock. The call sign appeared similar to Georgetown University's radio station, WGTB. Long time Washington radio listeners remember that station from the 1970s as a champion of the alternative rock of its time. WTGB's former DJs, Don \\"Cerphe\\" Colwell and Jonathan \\"Weasel\\" Gilbert (he left the station October, 2008), have each been involved with Washington radio for nearly 40 years, including stints for both at WHFS. When the station flipped formats, Cerphe left the air April, 2009. On August 10, 2008, WTGB dropped the triple A format and began returning to a classic rock format. Three weeks after the change, music director and midday personality Schelby Sweeney quit the station, and was replaced by Marci Wiser, formerly of New York City sister station WXRK.Radio and Records, August 29, 2008: \\"'Globe' Gets Wiser for MD/Middays: CBS Radio classic rock WTGB (the Globe 94.7)/Washington has recruited Marci Wiser as MD/middays. She is replacing Schelby Sweeney, who is leaving the station.\\" The \\"Globe\\" name (but not the \\"World Class Rock\\" slogan) stayed, and WTGB-HD2 flipped to a triple A format. The format change was likely because of low ratings; the station stayed in the bottom seven for its entire life as a triple A outlet.Radio & Records: Washington DC Radio ratings On September 1, 2008, WTGB began using the branding 'Classic Rock 94.7 The Globe' on air. On February 14, 2009, however, the station's name would change to simply 'Classic Rock 94.7', like it was for some time while the station was still WARW. A new logo and website followed on March 9, 2009. =94.7 Fresh FM= alt= Second and final logo of Fresh FM, 2014-2018 CBS Radio announced on March 30, 2009 that 94.7 FM would be switching to an adult contemporary format at Noon on April 6, 2009 as \\"94.7 Fresh FM\\". It was said to have the same branding as sister stations WWFS in New York and WCFS-FM in Chicago. CBS aimed to have the new station compete with Clear Channel's Adult Contemporary WASH-FM, as well as Citadel's Hot Adult Contemporary WRQX (which has since been sold to Cumulus Media and shifted to Top 40, but would shift back to Hot AC in November 2015, and became a member station of K-Love in May 2019). The rivalry with WASH-FM was hinted at in various promotion spots using the tagline \\"None of that WASHed up old stuff, just Fresh new music.\\" On December 16, 2009, WTGB became WIAD, becoming the only Fresh FM station not using \\"FS\\" in its call sign. KEZK-FM in St. Louis, Missouri followed suit the following year. In September 2010, Zapoleon Media Strategies consultant Steve Davis was hired as Program Director. Davis eliminated the voice tracking of talent from outside the market and brought in a staff of live talent that included Tommy McFly from competitor WRQX. The original live lineup included Davis in mornings, market veteran Kristie McIntyre in midday and McFly in afternoons. This lineup remained in place for six months until McFly moved to mornings to create \\"The Tommy Show\\" with noted DC blogger Kelly Collis and former WMAL morning producer Jen Richer. Darik Kristofer from WSTR in Atlanta was brought in to replace McFly in afternoons and Taylor Shay came on board from WIHT to do nights, and was switched to the weekday midday shift (she has since left the station). Musically, the station evolved into Hot AC and was, at one time, considered one of the best in the country in the format. Ratings significantly improved with \\"Fresh\\" having the highest ratings in the frequency's history. WIAD quickly became consistently within the Top 5 in the station's target demos. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and the merger was consummated on the November 17. =94.7 The Drive= On October 2, 2018, Entercom fired the entire airstaff except for afternoon drive host Darik Kristofer who stayed to help with the transition.Beaujon, Andrew (October 2, 2018). \\"The \\"Tommy Show\\" Is Over at 94.7 Fresh FM\\".

It allows players to pilot simulations of real-world commercial and civilian aircraft in and around Seattle, Washington. Players can fly freely or engage in \\"Challenge\\" missions, such as thwarting a theft or locating Bigfoot. The development team built on the general aviation gameplay of Flight Unlimited II, with more detailed physics and terrain, more planes, and a real-time weather system. Roughly half of Flight Unlimited IIs team returned to work on the sequel, supported by new hires. Lead designer Peter James described Flight Unlimited IIIs development as a struggle, thanks to a lack of interest from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 and Fly!, the game failed to capture sufficient market share. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise and that the game's system requirements were extremely high.  Gameplay  The player flies over Mount Rainier in the Beechcraft Baron 58, using visual navigation Flight Unlimited III is a three-dimensional (3D) flight simulator video game, in which the player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A, and five planes first included in Flight Unlimited II. Plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight Unlimited II may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time. In addition to the default \\"Quick Flight\\" mode, the player may play tutorial and \\"Challenge\\" missions. The game's tutorial mode features 26 lessons, which demonstrate basic and advanced flying techniques and then allow the player to perform them. Challenge missions test the player's flying ability with objectives such as locating Bigfoot, rescuing a stranded hiker, stopping a theft, or flying through hoops. Eleven Challenges are available, but the player may create more or download them from the Internet. Flight Unlimited III includes the level editor (\\"FLED\\") used to develop the game, which allows players to use the game's assets to create airports, AI flight paths, and edited landscapes. Players may share their creations online. Development Following the release of Flight Unlimited II in 1997, certain members of that game's team wanted to move on to Flight Unlimited III, while others wanted to create the combat flight simulation game Flight Combat. Looking Glass Studios chose to develop the games simultaneously: the team was split into two, both supplemented with new hires. The company then surveyed customers to determine where Flight Unlimited III should take place, among other things. In May 1998, Electronic Arts was announced as the game's publisher, as part of a multi- title marketing and distribution deal that also included System Shock 2. Looking Glass's goal was to build on the foundation of Flight Unlimited II and to provide what project leader Tom Sperry called \\"the true joy and sensation of flight in the most realistic environment available\\". The company first displayed Flight Unlimited III at the MicroWINGS Conference in August 1998. At the show, the game was revealed to take place in and around Seattle‚Äîa choice based on fan requests and on the varied landscape and weather of Puget Sound. Looking Glass also discussed new planes, moving objects on the ground, and a real-time, physics-based weather system. Former flight instructor Peter James, who had worked on Flight Unlimited II, assumed the role of lead designer. He was largely responsible for Flight Unlimited III's lessons, planes, and simulated flight instruments. James believed that other flight simulators had holes with regard to realism, and he hoped to create a more accurate experience. Photographs were captured of each plane's real-world counterpart, and construction of the 3D plane models was led by artist Duncan Hsu, a former car modeler at Papyrus Design Group. The flight physics were coded by Kevin Wasserman and involve real-time calculations of force vectors, such as those acting against a plane's yaw, pitch, and roll. This system was more advanced than that of Flight Unlimited II, which was also based on force calculations. The physics code was informed by \\"real aircraft data\\" and the personal experience of pilots, and each of the planes was flown as research for the game. Because the plane cockpits of previous Flight Unlimited games had been criticized by pilots, the team tried to make Flight Unlimited IIIs cockpits extremely authentic. Kemal Amarasingham recorded the planes' sound effects, which he said involved \\"risking his life\\" by standing near jet engines and underwings. Seattle was selected as the main setting of Flight Unlimited III partly because of its varied weather and landscape The game's terrain texture maps were made with satellite images rendered at four square meters per pixel, the highest resolution used in a flight simulator at that time. Artist Karen Wolff designed the terrain by combining large topographic maps into a \\"mosaic\\", which recreated the elevations and depressions of the Seattle area. The satellite imagery was layered over the resultant polygonal mesh. Real elevation data was also used for the eight lower-resolution Western American states outside of the Seattle area. Budget concerns and the storage limitations of the CD-ROM format prevented the team from rendering the entire United States, despite fan demand. The 3D objects that move across the terrain were created by Yoosun Cho, who used numerous photography books for inspiration. Flight Unlimited IIIs object editor let her set these objects to \\"move once along the path, back and forth or cycle\\". The weather system, co- designed by James, generates, moves, and disperses weather fronts based on real-time calculations of atmospheric conditions such as humidity and orographic lift. =Management and final months= While visiting Looking Glass to cover Flight Unlimited IIIs development, journalist Dan Linton was impressed by the team management of Tom Sperry, producer Sandra Smith, and vice president of marketing Michael Malizola. He wrote that they employed \\"suggestion and encouragement\\" instead of \\"demands\\", and he believed that their work was in large part responsible for the game \\"setting a new standard in the industry\\". Peter James later accused the wider company's management of being lukewarm toward Flight Unlimited III during development, since their biggest sellers were action-oriented games like Thief: The Dark Project. He claimed that their lack of interest turned the optimistic team into a \\"grumbling group of depressed and sometimes angry [people]\\". Although he, Smith, and Perry petitioned the company's managers to plan future add-ons and third-party development for the game, James felt that they were ignored. James developed concepts for a sequel in his spare time, but his ideas were shelved to wait for Flight Unlimited IIIs sales figures, which had to surpass those of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 for Flight Unlimited IV to be greenlit. James believed that this was \\"foolish\\", particularly because he felt that Electronic Arts undermarketed the game. He wrote that Flight Unlimited III's marketing manager had \\"great plans\\" but that his \\"hands seem[ed] tied\\". Flight Unlimited IIIs official site was opened in March 1999, and the game was shown alongside Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May. Tal Blevins of IGN wrote that the game had \\"come a long way\\" since he had seen it earlier in the year, and that it was almost complete, with development of the real-time weather system in its final stages. Full Throttle noted the game's \\"impressive clouds\\" and \\"slick looking\\" HUD. Flight Unlimited III was shown again at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in July, at which point beta testing was nearly complete and the game was \\"90% done\\", according to James. He stated that the public reaction was \\"great\\", which energized the team for a short time. The game went gold that August, nine months behind schedule. James wrote that the team celebrated with a small dinner party, and that \\"the next few days were spent finding out how many people [were] quitting.\\" He left after the game's completion to join Flightsim.com, a news and review website dedicated to flight simulators. The game was released on September 17, 1999. Reception Flight Unlimited III was placed in direct competition with flight simulators such as Fly! and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000. The game failed to capture sufficient market share and became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops. It sold roughly 20,000 copies in the United States during 1999. The game later earned a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Together with the costly development of Flight Combat, the game's low sales used up Looking Glass's earnings from Thief: The Dark Project and System Shock 2, which had helped them recover from the failures of British Open Championship Golf and Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri. These events contributed to the company's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000. The game was, however, positively received by critics, with an aggregate review score of 88% on GameRankings. Josh Nolan of Computer Gaming World wrote, \\"FU3 is experience-oriented: it's user- friendly, graphically glamorous, and lots of fun.\\" While he praised its visuals and air traffic control, he considered the game to be simpler than Flight Simulator 2000 because of its less detailed lessons, interfaces, and flight physics. The magazine later nominated Flight Unlimited III as the 1999 \\"Simulation of the Year\\". Writing for Computer Games Magazine, Denny Atkin stated that the use of turbulence \\"really sets FU3 apart from the competition\\", and that the game's simulation of air traffic is \\"like no other sim\\". He praised its graphics and dynamic weather, and he found the flight physics solid in general but \\"overly gentle\\" for aerobatic maneuvers. He concluded, \\"It's not only an excellent simulus of general aviation flying, ... it's even a good game.\\" PC Gamer UKs Dean Evans wrote that the game has \\"a poetic grandeur\\", as well as an \\"astonishing attention to detail\\" greater than that of its predecessors. He praised its flight lessons and weather, and he considered the graphics to be \\"unbelievably delicious\\". Evans summarized the game as \\"the most breathtaking flying experience you can get for a PC.\\" Simon Bradley of PC Zone wrote, \\"FUIII has atmosphere in a way that MS Combat Flight Sim can't even dream of.\\" He praised its graphics, flight physics, and detailed flight environment. He also complained of \\"unflyably slow frame rates\\" and warned that the game could not be played on older computers. Tony Lopez of GameSpot called the game's environmental modeling \\"simply breathtaking\\" and noted that elevations were rendered more smoothly than in Fly! or Microsoft Flight Simulator. He wrote that the game's flight physics and weather simulation were superior to those of any other flight simulator and that the \\"powerful, easy-to-use\\" FLED editing tool could popularize the game. IGN writer Marc Saltzman commented that the game features \\"absolutely stunning terrain at all altitudes, realistic weather and lighting effects, and highly-detailed planes\\". Saltzman praised the accuracy of Flight Unlimited IIIs physics but remarked that the game's frame rate was \\"noticeably slower\\" than that of its rivals.

It is a popular park due to its proximity to the city of Tampa. The park consists of over 2,990 acres, and there are more than seven miles of trails that run throughout it. Popular activities include fishing, canoeing, kayaking, picnicking, camping, birding, easy to moderate hiking, trail running, and nature photography. The park has award-winning campgrounds, a restaurant, and gift shop. Canoes and bicycles can be rented at the park.  Environment  Much of the park is a live oak hammock due to its proximity to the river. Certain sections are swampy, but much of the forest surrounding the river is elevated, so floods are not regular. Land near the entrance of the park consists of pine trees and saw palmettos. The park is cleaved into two halves by a swiftly flowing section of the Hillsborough River. This section of the river is noted for having several clusters of small rapids, including Class II rapids. It is considered a blackwater river, and is one of the few rivers in Florida to have a system of rapids.  History =Park Creation= Hillsborough River State Park is one of the eight original Florida State Parks created in 1938. The park was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and some of the original structures remain, including the buildings that now house the administrative offices and Interpretive Center, the suspension bridge, and a section of fence. These demonstrate the rustic architecture style that was popular with the CCC. =The Second Seminole War= Also located on park land is a replica of Fort Foster, which was originally built in 1836 during the Second Seminole War. Tours of the fort are given on weekends, which is the only way to view the fort. On special occasions, reenactments happen at the fort, where visitors can interact with \\"soldiers\\" in replica uniforms to learn about their duties at the fort. The Interpretive Center, which is located near the original entrance to the park, showcases many artifacts from the war. Both sides of the conflict are represented in the center, with a collection of more than 100 objects on display.

The group has consisted of lead vocalist Atsushi Sakurai, lead guitarist Hisashi Imai, rhythm guitarist Hidehiko Hoshino, bassist Yutaka Higuchi and drummer Toll Yagami since 1985. The band has experimented with many different genres of music throughout their three decade career, including punk rock, industrial rock and gothic rock. Buck-Tick are commonly credited as one of the founders of the visual kei movement. They have released 22 studio albums, nearly all reaching the top ten on the charts. History=Formation (1983‚Äì1985)= Buck-Tick was originally formed in 1983. All five of the band members lived in Gunma prefecture. Hisashi Imai originally had the idea for the band, and wanted to start despite not knowing how to play any instruments at the time. He recruited his friend, Yutaka Higuchi, and the two of them began to practice ‚Äî Imai on guitar and Higuchi on bass. Then, Higuchi asked Hidehiko Hoshino, who had been his friend since their first year of high school, if he would like to join, too. Since Hoshino was tall and handsome, Higuchi tried to convince him to become the vocalist, but Hoshino was more interested in playing guitar, and did not want to be in the spotlight, so Imai's friend Araki became vocalist instead. Atsushi Sakurai, a rebellious loner in Imai's class who hung out with the bad-kid \\"Yankƒ´\\" crowd, volunteered to be the drummer.LOVE ME, Yasue Matsuura, Takao Nakagawa; Shinko Music Publishing Company, Ltd. 1989. . The Buck-Tick members went to high school with Bo√∏wy singer Kyosuke Himuro.Gunma Television Interview with Atsushi Sakurai, aired April 3, 2005. Imai named the band in Spring 1984. Once they had practiced enough to be able to play, they began to perform live at small, local events. They started out playing covers of songs by the famous Japanese punk band The Stalin. From the beginning, they were conscious of their image and tried to differentiate themselves from the crowd. They performed in suits with their hair up and soon added white face makeup, as well. When Imai graduated high school, he moved to Tokyo with Araki and enrolled in design school. When Higuchi and Hoshino graduated a year later, they also moved to Tokyo ‚Äî Higuchi for business school and Hoshino for culinary school. However, they returned home on weekends to practice together and play shows. During the summer of 1984, the band changed their name to Buck-Tick, which is a creative spelling of , the Japanese word for firecracker. They also began to perform original songs, written by Imai and a few by Hoshino. Sakurai's parents wouldn't let him move to Tokyo, so he was the only one left alone in Gunma, and became very depressed. He spent all his time alone, and to pass the time, he often went to concerts and watched bands live on TV, and he decided that he was sick of being a drummer and wanted to be a vocalist instead. Higuchi's brother Toll Yagami was also in a band, SP, and when SP lost their vocalist, Sakurai asked Yagami if he could be the replacement. Yagami politely refused his request, and SP broke up. However, at the same time, the rest of Buck-Tick was becoming frustrated with Araki. As Imai's composing skills improved, Araki became unable to carry the melodies to the songs. Though it was painful for them, the band decided to fire Araki, and Sakurai convinced them to let him take Araki's place. Buck-Tick was now missing a drummer, but the hole was soon filled by Yagami, after Higuchi convinced him that the best way for him to get over the loss of his own band was to join theirs instead. This became the final lineup for the band, and has not changed since. =Independent period (1985‚Äì1987)= After the change in the lineup, Buck-Tick became more and more serious about music. When Sakurai's father died, he too moved to Tokyo. The five members worked during the day and practiced and performed at night. Then, in July 1986, they attracted the attention of Sawaki Kazuo, head of Taiyou Records, an independent label. He had seen the band perform at a live house called Shinjuku Attic, and had been very impressed. He claimed to have clairvoyant powers and told the band they would succeed within a year. The band signed to Taiyou Records immediately and released their first single, \\"To-Search\\" on October 21 of the same year. With Sawaki's help they began promoting themselves very actively. They played the live house circuit in Tokyo and on April 1, 1987 released their first album, Hurry Up Mode. In conjunction with the release, they played a live called \\"Buck-Tick Phenomenon\\" at the 1,200-capacity Toyoto Public Hall in Ikebukuro. Everyone in the local music scene believed the hall was too large for the band and that the concert would be doomed to failure, but Buck-Tick used a very clever advertising strategy: they pasted thousands of eye-catching, black-and-white sticker advertisements all over Tokyo's hip youth districts that read simply \\"Buck- Tick Phenomenon April 1st Toyoto Public Hall\\". Their staff members were nearly arrested for defacement of public property, but the strategy worked. Buck-Tick sold over half the tickets to the show, which was a huge accomplishment. They were an instant success, and major labels began vying for the chance to sign them. =Major label debut (1987‚Äì1988)= A number of major labels competed hotly for the honor of signing a contract with Buck-Tick. However, the band was initially unmoved by their offers. They wanted to continue pursuing music on their own terms, and they refused to sign unless the label would agree to their four stipulations: first, that the band would be able to make all their own decisions about their hair, makeup, clothing, and general image; second, that they would never be forced to change the band lineup; third, that they would never be forced to use session musicians; and last, that they would be able to do all their own production work.Picture Product disc 3: \\"Sen-Sor\\", directed by Takashi Musha & Yuko Sakurai, Victor Entertainment, 2002. Most record companies balked at the idea of accepting such high demands from such a young and inexperienced group, but Takagaki Ken, of Victor Invitation Records, decided he wanted the band so badly he was willing to let them do whatever they wanted. He even offered them Victor's Aoyama studio as a place to practice. On June 16, 1987, Buck-Tick played a show called \\"Buck-Tick Phenomenon II\\" at the Live Inn in Shibuya, to bid farewell to their indie days. The small venue was packed with people and the crowd grew so overexcited that the concert had to be interrupted multiple times so that the venue staff could try to get the fans to calm down. Afterward, a video of the concert called Buck-Tick Phenomenon Live at the Live Inn was released, reaching No. 4 on the Oricon video charts. On September 3, Buck-Tick opened their personal administrative office, which they named Shaking Hands, Inc., in honor of all the musical connections they hoped to make in the future. Soon after, they embarked on their first national tour. They released their first major label album, Sexual XXXXX! on November 21, and it climbed to No. 33 on the Oricon charts, which was completely unheard of for a debut album. Tickets to their large year-end live in Tokyo at the Japan Youth Hall sold out in two days. With success came new difficulties, though. The reporters who interviewed the band for magazines seemed to only be interested in the band's appearance, and asked questions like \\"Why do you put your hair up?\\", \\"How long does it take you to put your hair up?\\" and \\"Do you put up your hair in order to attract attention so you'll sell records?\\" The band members only put their hair up because they thought it looked cool. That was the only reason, they always answered, but eventually got so tired of the questions that they refused to answer them anymore. They had become popular enough that they could only play at large halls now. They missed small live houses, so they organized a secret gig under the false name \\"Bluck-Tlick\\" at Shinjuku Loft on January 24, 1988, and used it as an opportunity to play their older songs. They released the EP Romanesque on March 21, 1988. Their third album, Seventh Heaven, followed on June 21. =Taboo (1988‚Äì1989)= In September 1988, Buck-Tick went to London to record its fourth studio album, Taboo, which was produced by Owen Paul. They even played a gig there, at the Greyhound music club, and amongst those who attended were members of the band Der Zibet, who were also recording in London at the time. The members of Buck-Tick loved London, especially Sakurai, who felt that the music scene there was more welcoming of dark and serious music.Words by Buck-Tick, Shinko Music Publishing Company, Ltd. 2002. . English translation of 1994 interview with Atsushi Sakurai and Issay available here Indeed, with Taboo, the band broke into a darker, more serious sound which took a fair amount of criticism from members of the Japanese music scene who had previously thought of Buck-Tick as little more than idols. The album became the band's first to reach number one on the charts when it was released in January 1989. However, their first major label single \\"Just One More Kiss\\", became Buck-Tick's first hit in October 1988. The band made their first live television appearance performing it on the popular music program Music Station. The song was also used in a series of television commercials in which the band appeared advertising Victor's CDian Stereo, with the slogan \\"The super bass will firecracker.\\" (a pun on Buck-Tick's name, which means \\"firecracker\\"). At the end of the year, Buck-Tick won \\"Rookie of the Year\\" at the Japan Record Awards.Buck-Tick at CD Journal Retrieved Aug 26 2007 =Hiatus and Aku no Hana (1989‚Äì1990)= In March 1989, the band started its Taboo tour. At this point they had stopped putting their hair up so much, and Sakurai had even given up on dyeing his and let it be black. The tour was scheduled to run through May, but it was cancelled abruptly when Imai was arrested for LSD possession.Newspaper article from 1989 with information about Imai Hisashi‚Äôs arrest for LSD possession The incident was covered in newspapers and tabloids at the time, but since, the band has kept it very quiet. Buck-Tick went on hiatus and Imai had to appear at a court hearing, which was attended by hundreds of concerned fans and was covered on television. Fans and reporters alike wondered whether Imai's arrest spelled the end for Buck-Tick, but in the fall of 1989, the band went back to the studio and recorded its fifth studio album, Aku no Hana (\\"Evil Flowers\\") which was named after Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal (a favorite book of Sakurai's), because the album dealt with similar themes. With Aku no Hana, the band went much further into the dark and gothic image they had begun to explore in Taboo and which would later become their trademark. Aku no Hana became their second consecutive number one album and remains the group's best-selling to date. Before the album was released they played a huge concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 29 in front of 50,000 people, in order to celebrate their return. It was the largest concert the band had ever played. Since then, the band has held a large concert nearly every year at the end of December, usually at the Nippon Budokan, to celebrate the anniversary of their reunion after Imai's arrest. Since 2001, they have named the concerts \\"The Day in Question\\", and the shows have often been broadcast live on TV. =Kurutta Taiyou and continuing musical maturity (1990‚Äì1995)= In 1990, the band threw themselves back into touring, and over the summer, released an album called Symphonic Buck-Tick in Berlin, featuring orchestral versions of some of their songs performed by the Berlin Chamber Orchestra. In the fall, they went back to the studio to work on their sixth album, Kurutta Taiyou (\\"Crazy Sun\\"). They spent much more time on this album than any of their previous ones, and the difference was noticeable. The sound is much deeper and more sophisticated, using many more studio production effects than previously. It was at this point that the direction of the band began to change subtly, as Sakurai began to write almost all of the lyrics, and exert his creative influence more. Around this time, he was married to the band's stylist, Sayuri Watanabe, but they quickly divorced (the band later got a new stylist, Mr. Takayuki Tanizaki, who is still working for them). Sakurai's mother, who he had been very close to, also died, and due to the band's busy touring schedule, he was unable to visit her before the end.Snob Rock Mode & Art Magazine, „ÄåÊ´ª‰∫ïÊï¶Âè∏„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÁî∑„Äç(\\"A man called Atsushi Sakurai\\"), Keiko Oshibe, 2005. In interviews, Sakurai said that the pain he felt from these events strongly influenced his lyrics, and that this was when he started writing about real emotions, rather than what he thought was cool. Subsequently, he changed the first kanji in his name from the standard character \\"\\" (\\"sakura\\") to the older version \\"\\", and since then has brought a continuously evolving sense of melancholy and psychological depth to the band's lyrics. Kurutta Taiyou was released on February 21, 1991. Four days later, the band performed a unique concert called \\"Satellite Circuit\\", which was recorded in a studio with no audience and then broadcast on television and at special concert halls around the country. In 1992, Buck-Tick released their first compilation album, Koroshi no Shirabe This Is Not Greatest Hits. As the title suggested, it wasn't a typical \\"best- of\\" album. Instead, the band had spent many hours in the studio re-recording (and in some cases radically changing) songs they had already released. A tour followed the album, culminating in a two-day live event called \\"Climax Together\\", which took place at Yokohama Arena on September 10 and 11. The event had been put together specifically to be filmed, and great care had been taken with the lighting and design‚Äîfor greater dramatic effect, the stage was even set up along the long side of the hall and obscured by a gigantic scrim which was dropped partway through the set. On May 21, 1993, Buck-Tick released the single \\"Dress\\", which was later re-released in 2005 and used as the opening theme for the Trinity Blood anime. Soon after, on June 23, Buck-Tick released their seventh studio album, Darker Than Darkness -Style 93- a loose concept album focusing on death. The album confused fans because after the last track (track 10), the CD skips and picks up at track 75, which began with strange buzzing noises and slowly evolved into another song. This technique was rare in Japan at that time, and apparently some fans tried to return their CDs to stores, claiming that they were broken. On this album, the band also began to experiment with different instruments ‚Äî Hoshino played keyboards, and during live shows, Sakurai tried his hand at the saxophone. Both Sakurai and Hoshino played these instruments on the band's next album, Six/Nine. Released on May 15, 1995, Six/Nine was an even more psychological, conceptual album than Darker Than Darkness -Style 93- had been. Before the album was released, the band had another set of video concerts, featuring equally conceptual music videos for each song, directed by Hayashi Wataru. One of the songs, \\"Itoshi no Rock Star\\", featured Issay (Der Zibet) on backing vocals, he also appeared with the band on the tour. =Label and management changes, \\"cyberpunk\\" years (1996‚Äì2003)= In 1996, Buck-Tick broke from Shaking Hands Inc, and started their own management company, Banker Ltd., of which Toll is president, and started their new fan club, Fish Tank. On June 21, they released their ninth album, Cosmos, which featured a brighter sound than was usual for the band and also electronic, cyberpunk-influenced music in such songs as \\"Living on the Net\\". Unfortunately, the tour for the album had to be canceled halfway through. Sakurai, while in Nepal doing a photo shoot for the band, fell seriously ill with peritonitis. When he was told how serious his condition was, he begged to be flown back to Tokyo so that if he died, he could die at home, but once back in Japan \\"he felt so relieved that he was able to recover\\". In 1997, following on the heels of Sakurai's illness was more upheaval for the band as they changed labels from Victor to Mercury Music Entertainment. They played make-up shows for the concerts that had been canceled the previous year. On December 10, they released their tenth studio album, Sexy Stream Liner, marking the maturation of their new cyberpunk style, which emerged in their visual image as well, with the band sporting \\"tattoos\\" and electronic gadgetry on their costumes. Imai began to incorporate the use of a theremin into Buck-Tick's live shows and even into their recordings, beginning with the song \\"My Fuckin‚Äô Valentine\\". On May 13, 1998, they released the single \\"Gessekai\\", which was used as the opening theme to the anime series Nightwalker: The Midnight Detective. Shortly after this, on the wave of the anime boom, Japanese music began to gain popularity in the West by the internet, and \\"Gessekai\\" became the song that first introduced Buck-Tick to many foreign fans. Later in 1998, and continuing in 1999, the various Buck- Tick members involved themselves in many collaborations with other artists. However, they continued to release singles as a band and contributed a cover of \\"Doubt\\" to Tribute Spirits, an album in memory of hide who died in 1998. In 2000, Buck-Tick changed labels for a second time, leaving Mercury for BMG Funhouse. Their popularity had been growing overseas, especially in South Korea, and the band went to Korea for the first time. They were greeted enthusiastically by fans at the airport, and they held a formal interview, but did not perform live. Later, in 2001, they returned to Korea and played at the Dongducheon Rock Festival (a.k.a. \\"SoYo Rock Festival\\") in Seoul. It poured rain on the day of the festival and the band were drenched during their set, but nonetheless, the crowd was ecstatic.Mega Beat to Mega Hits television program, broadcast of Buck-Tick live at the SoYo Rock Festival, Seoul, 2001. (aired on Korean television) On September 20, 2000, the band released One Life, One Death, their first studio album in nearly three years, and played a tour to support the album. In addition to this, Sakurai and Imai became involved in a supergroup called Schwein, with Raymond Watts and Sascha Konietzko, which released two albums and toured Japan in August 2001. On March 6, 2002, Buck-Tick released their twelfth studio album, Kyokutou I Love You, which was initially scheduled to be released as a double album with Mona Lisa Overdrive. Ultimately the two were released separately and Mona Lisa Overdrive came out the following year in February. However musically, the two albums feed into each other in a continuous loop. The last track on Kyokutou I Love You is an instrumental which becomes the bottom musical layer of the first track on Mona Lisa Overdrive. Likewise, the last track on Mona Lisa Overdrive contains samples from the first track on Kyokutou I Love You. The album title Mona Lisa Overdrive is an overt reference to William Gibson's cyberpunk novel of the same name. Buck-Tick opened for Marilyn Manson when he played at Tokyo Bay NK Hall and Osaka-jo Hall in September 2003.Fool‚Äôs Mate (December 2003 issue), \\"Marilyn Manson vs. Buck-Tick Middle Finger Battle!\\", Takahiro Ishii, Rock Press, December 2003. =Solo projects and \\"gothic\\" years (2004‚Äì2005)= In 2004, Buck-Tick largely suspended activities in order for the band members to work on their individual musical projects. The only band member who did not release music during this time was Hoshino, who went on to form the band Dropz two years later in 2006. Buck-Tick did play a few shows together, including one at Yokohama Arena that was a reprise of their \\"Climax Together\\" shows 12 years before. The show was released on DVD as Akuma to Freud -Devil and Freud- Climax Together. April 6, 2005 saw the release of Juusankai wa Gekkou which also happened to be the band's fourteenth studio album. It was a concept album inspired by Sakurai's solo project that focused on the idea of \\"Goth\\", and despite the residual gothic image Buck-Tick had been cultivating for years, it was a significant departure from any of their previous work.Fool‚Äôs Mate # 283, „Äå\\" Â§ú\\" „ÅØÈÇ™ÊÇ™„Å´„ÇÇ„Å™„Çå„Çã„Åó„ÄÅ„Éî„É•„Ç¢„Å´„ÇÇ„Å™„Çå„Çã„Äç(\\"The night can become evil, or it can become pure\\"), Koh Imazu, May 2005.English translation available here Special care was taken with the sets and costumes for the tour. The live shows were very dramatic, and the band even hired a clown (Gaetano Totarou) and a ballerina (Becky Janik) to perform with them at some of the shows. At this time, visual kei and Gothic & Lolita had been growing significantly in popularity and with Juusankai wa Gekkou, Buck-Tick gained a large number of new fans domestically and overseas who admired the gothic style. On December 21, the tribute album Parade -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick- was released, which contains covers of their own songs performed by 13 different artists, including Kiyoharu, J, Abingdon Boys School and Rally (composed of members from Glay, Thee Michelle Gun Elephant and The Mad Capsule Markets). =20th Anniversary and \\"straight rock\\" years (2006‚Äì2011)= In 2006, as Buck-Tick prepared to celebrate their 20th anniversary as a major-label band, they released the single \\"Kagerou\\", which was used as the ending theme for the XxxHolic anime. On June 6, 2007, they released the single \\"Rendezvous\\", and on the same day embarked on the \\"Parade Tour\\", finally celebrating their anniversary and tribute album. The tour had a unique format: at each show, a different artist from the tribute album, performed with Buck-Tick. The tour culminated in a giant festival called \\"Buck-Tick Fest 2007 on Parade\\", which was held on September 8 at Minato Mirai in the Yokohama port. It lasted all day and featured all 13 artists off the tribute album. Each of the guest artists and Buck-Tick played a set, and as a grand finale, there was a fireworks show over the bay. Soon after this, on September 19, 2007 Buck-Tick released their fifteenth studio album, Tenshi no Revolver (\\"Angel's Revolver\\"). Though they continued using a few gothic elements, they discarded the use of synth for this album, the concept for which was a \\"band sound\\".VMC Online Interview No. 71, \\"Buck-Tick,\\" Eriko Ishii, 2007 English translation available here The band held a long national tour to support the album, which lasted until December. Also in December, the Japanese cellphone company SoftBank released special-edition Buck-Tick mobile phones that had been designed by the band members. At the end of 2008, BMG Japan was bought out by Sony Music Entertainment Japan and operated independently still as BMG until early 2009 where a company reorganization folded BMG completely into Sony. Thus causing the band to officially become a Sony Music Entertainment Japan artist, signed to the Ariola Japan subsidiary. The band released their next album, titled Memento Mori, on February 18, 2009. According to Sakurai, this album continues to explore the idea of \\"straight rock\\".Buck-Tick Fest 2007 on Parade disc 2: \\"Rest Rooms\\", directed by Kazuhiro Tokutomo, BMG/Funhouse 2008. English translation available here After the release of the album, they then went on to perform an extended concert tour spanning three months. The final concerts were held at Tokyo's NHK Hall. In March 2010, the group released the single \\"Dokudanjou Beauty\\". The second single of 2010 was released on September 1 titled \\"Kuchizuke\\" (\\"Kisses\\"), which was used as the opening theme for Fuji TV's Shiki anime. On October 13, Buck-Tick released its seventeenth studio album titled Razzle Dazzle. Which for the most part continued the straightforward rock sound, but also contained many instances of dance-rock, it also included cover artwork by graphic artist Aquirax Uno. Buck-Tick's song \\"Jupiter\\" was covered by DuelJewel on the compilation Crush! -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-, which was released on January 26, 2011 and features current visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the '90s visual kei movement. Their song \\"Speed\\" was covered by 9Goats Black Out on its sequel, Crush! 2 -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-, that was released on November 23, 2011. =25th Anniversary and Lingua Sounda (2012‚Äìpresent)= To celebrate their 25th anniversary, Buck-Tick opened a special website where they announced the creation of their own record label Lingua Sounda, and that its first releases will be a new single in spring 2012 and an album in the summer. They released two separate boxsets in March 2012, one containing work from 1987 to 1999 and the other from 2000 to 2010, titled Catalogue Victor‚ÜíMercury 87‚Äì99 and Catalogue Ariola 00‚Äì10 respectively. The single \\"Elise no Tame ni\\" was released on May 23, the same day as the DVD of their 2011 Day in Question concert. The band also performed the theme song for the play Tenshu Monogatari. Their next single, \\"Miss Take ~Boku wa Miss Take~\\", was released on July 4. Fans who ordered both \\"Miss Take\\" and \\"Elise\\" had a chance to win tickets to the band's promotional video shoot for the new song \\"Climax Together\\". A second tribute album to Buck-Tick was released on July 7, titled Parade II -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick- it featured 13 artists including acid android, Polysics and Acid Black Cherry. The band released their eighteenth studio album, Yume Miru Uchuu, on September 19 before holding Buck-Tick Fest 2012 On Parade on September 22 and 23, which attracted an estimated 14,000 fans and included bands who appear on the tribute album such as D'erlanger, Mucc, Merry, Pay money To my Pain, and others. The special 25th Anniversary film Buck-Tick ~Buck-Tick Phenomenon was shown in theaters in two parts in 2013, part one opening on June 15 and two on June 22, each for one week only. The band wrote two new songs exclusive for the film, \\"Love Parade\\" composed by Hoshino and \\"Steppers -Parade-\\" by Imai. Buck-Tick released the single \\"Keijijou Ryuusei\\" on May 14, 2014 and their nineteenth studio album, Arui wa Anarchy, on June 4. On June 28, 2015, Buck-Tick performed at the Lunatic Fest hosted by Luna Sea and were joined onstage by J for \\"Iconoclasm\\". At the end of their Day in Question concert on December 29, 2015 the band announced their return to Victor Entertainment with Lingua Sounda becoming its sub label. On September 11, 2016 the group played the live show entitled Climax Together 3rd at Yokohama Arena, 12 years after their second one and 24 years after their first one. Buck-Tick released the single \\"New World\\" on September 21, 2016, and their twentieth studio album Atom Miraiha No.9 on September 28. Buck-Tick won the special \\"Inspiration Award Japan\\" at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards Japan. Their single \\"Babel\\" was released on November 15, 2017. Following the February 21, 2018, release of its second single \\"Moon Sayonara wo Oshiete\\", Buck-Tick's twenty-first album No.0 was released on March 14. They performed on the first night of the special hide 20th Memorial Super Live Spirits event at Tokyo Otaiba Yagai Tokusetsu Stage J Chikuon on April 28, 2018, in memory of hide. In 2020, Buck-Tick released the single \\"Datenshi\\" on January 29. A fan club tour was announced, but postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Another new single, \\"Moonlight Escape\\", was released on August 26. On July 22, 2020, the band announced their new album, Abracadabra, released on September 21. Music style Buck-Tick's music has changed and evolved hugely over the course of their career. Their early work is what the Japanese call \\"positive punk\\". It used simple rhythms and chords, with the songs mostly in major keys and using some English words in the lyrics. Starting with 1989's Taboo, they experimented with a darker sound, which grew more mature with Kurutta Taiyou in 1991. Darker Than Darkness -Style 93- delved into a harsher industrial rock sound which continued all the way up through Mona Lisa Overdrive in 2003. More recently, with 2005's Juusankai wa Gekkou, they have deliberately adopted a \\"goth\\" concept, which they combined with a retro straight rock sound for the albums Tenshi no Revolver (2007) and Memento Mori (2009). Their next album, 2010's Razzle Dazzle, then incorporated many instances of dance-rock. =Influence= Some elements that persist throughout their music are resounding, jangling guitar chords, throbbing, prominent bass lines, harsh roars of electronically distorted noise, and ambivalent melodies that wander between major and minor keys, as well as Sakurai's distinctive rich baritone voice. Sakurai is famous for the erotic decadence of his lyrics (which are now predominantly in Japanese), but he also often addresses existential psychological themes. The song \\"Rakuen (Inori Koinegai)\\" caused controversy because some of the lyrics were lifted from the Quran and later the album was re-issued with the offending part removed by November 1995. Imai has written many songs that read like science fiction stories, involving genetic engineering and computer hackers, but more recently has branched out into simple love songs. Buck-Tick was most strongly influenced by Western rock, especially British post-punk from the 1970s and 1980s, though they cite a few Japanese influences as well. The influences that the band members collectively name the most often are Love & Rockets, Robert Smith, and Bauhaus (the band admitted to going together to see Peter Murphy live.) They also mention the Sex Pistols and XTC. Imai was especially influenced by Love & Rockets, and this is very evident on Buck- Tick's album Kurutta Taiyou. He was also influenced by Yellow Magic Orchestra, Kraftwerk, Ultravox and other new wave and electronica acts, and the punk band The Stalin. Sakurai was hugely influenced by David Bowie, and he even played a cover of Bowie's song \\"Space Oddity\\" at his solo live in 2004. He is also influenced by post-punk/first wave goth acts such as The Sisters of Mercy, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Clan of Xymox, and Der Zibet and Masami Tsuchiya. He claims to love \\"dark\\" music in general. Hoshino and Yagami love The Beatles. Yagami is also a fan of Led Zeppelin and other classic metal/punk acts like Kiss and The Clash.Hyp No. 3 Buck-Tick Special Issue, Hideaki Utsumi, Fool‚Äôs Mate Inc. 1990. Regarded as one of the founders of visual kei, Buck-Tick have influenced as many bands and musicians as they have been influenced by.

Dir en grey vocalist Kyo was inspired to become a rock star after seeing a picture of Sakurai on the desk of a junior high school classmate. Likewise, his bandmate Die became interested in rock music in junior high after hearing Aku no Hana. D vocalist Asagi listed Buck-Tick as one of their biggest influences. His bandmate Tsunehito named Buck-Tick as one of his two favorite Japanese bands. Nagoya kei band Deadman cited Buck-Tick as an inspiration. Well-known visual kei rock musicians Tatsurou (Mucc), Yuu (Merry), Aie (Deadman), Lay (Fatima) and Tsuyoshi (Karimero) formed a Buck-Tick cover band called Bluck-Tlick.

He was named by the FBI as the 475th fugitive to be placed on the list of FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives on June 29, 2002.  Early life  Robert William Fisher was born on April 13, 1961 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were William Fisher, a banker, and Jan Howell. He has two sisters with whom he attended Sahuaro High School in Tucson, Arizona. William and Jan divorced in 1976, when he was 15. According to friends and relatives, the divorce was very turbulent and unsettling, leaving long-lasting effects on him. He reportedly spoke of it with coworkers at Mayo Clinic Hospital and once confided to an associate that his life would have been different had Jan not left the family. Adult life Fisher joined the U.S. Navy. He attempted to become part of the SEALs, but did not succeed. He married Mary Cooper in 1987. He has worked as a surgical catheter technician, respiratory therapist, and firefighter, and was an avid outdoorsman, hunter, and fisherman. He was described as a cruel and distant control freak toward his family. He once turned a garden hose on Mary after she spoke up. He only allowed her to paint the walls white, and she was not permitted to hang up quilts that she had made on it. They fought about sex and money, with her taking a job that she told friends was a \\"security fund.\\" He was embarrassed that Bobby did not like to hunt or fish, and once tried to teach him and Brittney how to swim by throwing them out of a boat. Hunting partner Sandy Gillespie said, \\"They were crying, and Brittney was screaming, and he pulled them back in the boat and he said, 'Now there, how's that?'\\" He nonetheless tried to hold on to an image as a devoted family man. Mary's mother, Ginny Cooper, told investigators, \\"Fisher didn't socialize often with family because of a fear of getting too close to people and losing them.\\" Jan told investigators that she had been a \\"yes-sir\\" wife who did not stand up to William. She added that she saw similar dynamics early in Fisher's marriage to Mary and that she had spoken to her about her concerns. A close friend of his stated that his family bore a striking resemblance to that of his childhood. Fisher had been an outdoorsman and a hunter since he was a young adult. Friends noticed him exhibiting disturbing behavior on hunting trips and other outdoor occasions. In one case, after killing an elk, he began smearing its blood on his face. On at least one occasion, he snuck up behind a family that was picnicking and emptied his gun into the air. Fisher had been an active member of the Scottsdale Baptist Church. He participated in the men's ministry, but unlike Mary, he had begun to withdraw from the activities a few months prior to the murders. In 1998, the Fishers went to the senior pastor for marital counseling. Fisher told coworkers about a one-night affair with a prostitute he met in a massage parlor. He fretted that Mary would find out that it was the cause of a urinary tract infection that left him ill for several days in December 2000. \\"They did not have a happy marriage,\\" said Wade Rencsok, a former neighbor. \\"They screamed constantly. Everybody heard it. You could hear it in the house next door. And you never really heard him scream, which is kind of weird. I mean he had a way about him, but you never heard him scream. You always heard his wife screaming. Things like, 'You're worthless. I could have done better than you. We should get a divorce.'\\" Fisher told a hunting mate that he was renewing his commitment to his faith and marriage because he \\"could not live without his family\\", possibly hinting that he would consider suicide over divorce. According to psychologists, an intense fear of loss is not unusual for an individual traumatized by divorce while an adolescent. In the weeks before her death, Mary told several friends that she was going to divorce him.  Triple homicide and arson  A neighbor reported hearing a loud argument inside the Fisher home on April 9, 2001, at 10:30pm, approximately ten hours before it blew up in an explosion. However, police theorized that the murders took place between 9:30 and 10:15. At 10:43, Fisher was spotted on an ATM camera, where he withdrew $280. Mary's Toyota 4Runner was in the background. She was shot in the back of the head and Brittney and Bobby's throats were slashed from ear to ear. At 8:42am, the house exploded. Firefighters were immediately alerted to the explosion, which was strong enough to collapse the front brick wall and rattle the frames of neighboring houses for in all directions. Firefighters kept the blaze from spreading to other houses. A series of smaller secondary explosions, believed to be caused by either rifle ammunition or paint cans, forced them to keep their distance. One suffered minor injuries to his leg when he lost his balance and fell near the blaze. The gas line from the back of the house's furnace had been pulled. The accumulating gas was later ignited by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given him an approximate ten-hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. His decision to have the house explode is believed to have been an attempt to conceal evidence of his crimes and possibly to cause police to believe that he had died. The burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed in the burned out remains. They were identified as Mary (age 38), Brittney (age 12), and Bobby (age 10). Investigators theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and did not want Brittney and Bobby to go through what he did as a child.  Investigation  Fisher, who disappeared at the time of the murders, was named as an official (and to date, the only) person of interest in the case on April 14, 2001, when Arizona Department of Public Safety officers were instructed in a statewide bulletin to arrest him. On April 20, the last physical evidence of his whereabouts surfaced, when police found Mary's Toyota 4Runner and their dog, Blue, in Tonto National Forest, near the towns of Young and Payson, Arizona, a hundred miles north of Scottsdale. A pile of human excrement was found near the passenger door. Although police searched the area immediately around where it was found, they only searched one out of dozens of nearby caves. Several professional cavers have suggested that Fisher used them as a hiding place before either escaping, killing himself, or dying from low oxygen levels. The spot on which his truck was discovered was located less than a mile from the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, an area which police never searched. A couple reported seeing a man several days before his truck was discovered walking along the nearby Young Road who resembled him. According to them, when the woman saw him, she said to her husband, \\"That looks like Robert Fisher.\\" However, they waited until after his truck was found to report the tip. Lori Greenbeck, an acquaintance of the Fisher family, said that her husband had gone camping with him in the area where his truck was found shortly before April 10. She said that her husband believed that Fisher was scouting the area. According to her, he was very familiar with the region. On July 19, a state arrest warrant was issued in Phoenix, charging Fisher with three counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson. Subsequently, he was declared a fugitive, and a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, charging him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. On June 29, 2002, he was named by the FBI as the 475th fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted list. He was also on the America's Most Wanted \\"Dirty Dozen\\" list of its most notorious fugitives, and was profiled on The Hunt with John Walsh. The FBI offers a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to his capture. , FBI had received \\"hundreds and hundreds of leads.\\" However, all reported sightings of Fisher have been inconclusive or false. In the years immediately following his disappearance, some people living in Fisher's old neighborhood reported seeing a man resembling him driving in the area. In February 2004, an individual with a striking physical resemblance to him was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The man had a missing tooth where Fisher had a gold bicuspid as well as a surgical scar on his back, also like Fisher. However, his fingerprints did not match. He was held by Canadian police for approximately one week until a relative correctly identified him. Responding to speculation that his fingerprints had been altered, Scottsdale Detective John Kirkham said that there was no scarring on them to suggest this. His identity was not released. The FBI alerted local law enforcement in 2012 that Fisher may be living in the Payson area in Gila County, Arizona. Detective T.J. Diran suggested that Fisher may have used his survival skills to continue living in the wooded area near Payson. In October 2014, police raided a house in Commerce City, Colorado after receiving a tip that he was hiding there. Despite arresting two occupants, they did not find any sign of him. Fisher is considered armed and extremely dangerous and has ties to Florida and New Mexico. There has been speculation that he has committed suicide or started a new life under an assumed identity. FBI agent Bob Caldwell's sense of his personality and habits is that he is \\"arrogant. He's cocky. He's a know-it-all...and a loner.\\" He chews tobacco and favors the Copenhagen brand, sometimes walks in an odd, erect manner with his chest out due to back pain, and is an avid hunter and fisherman. In April 2016, FBI officials and Scottsdale police displayed new age-enhanced photos of Fisher during a news conference on the fifteenth anniversary of the murders. 379x379px Due in part to such factors as the small amount of money that Fisher is believed to have had with him and the lengthy period of time that has gone by since his disappearance, some people believe that he committed suicide, although others have said that he is still alive. \\"Maybe this is the best we have, knowing he did it, and never finding him again,\\" said Detective John Heintzelman.  In popular culture  Fisher was the subject of a documentary entitled Where is Robert Fisher?. It was released in 2011. It relied heavily on interviews with journalists and detectives, and also featured interviews with his sister and one of his neighbors. The documentary included home footage of him taken by Mary, which was described as eerie and disturbing. The backdoor pilot of the CBS show FBI: Most Wanted depicted a story nearly identical to Fisher's. It aired on April 2, 2019, as Episode 18 of Season 1 of the CBS show FBI.

History The bridge was opened in 1969 to replace an old bridge to the south, known as the Red Bridge, which connected the ends of Waterman Street on either side of the Seekonk River. The bridge was named after its designer, George Henderson (engineer), of Rumford, Rhode Island. =Previous bridges in the area= This is the sixth bridge to have been built in this part of the Seekonk River. The first was a wooden bridge built by Moses Brown in 1793 called the Central Bridge, which connected the respective ends of Waterman Avenue. The same year, Brown's brother John built the first Washington Bridge at a ferry landing point one mile south, connecting India Point and Watchemoket Square. The second and third bridges were built as replacements and were destroyed in 1807 and 1815, respectively. A swing bridge was built in 1872, which was replaced by a sturdier bridge of the same type in 1895. =Henderson Expressway= The Henderson Bridge was part of an envisioned expressway that was planned as a US 44 freeway that would have extended from a Gano Street interchange with Interstate 195. The current Gano Street ramps were built specifically for the proposed US 44 freeway, which was planned to follow along the west shore of the Seekonk River, over the Henderson Bridge, and then head northeasterly through East Providence, to US 44 just east of Route 114 and US 1A. Since the freeway was never completed, the section that exists today was not given a route number, though is commonly referred to as the Henderson Expressway. The planned freeway's right-of-way and landholdings still exist in East Providence, where they are completely cleared to the freeway's proposed end at US 44\\\\. Under the Bridge Woods and trails under and around the East Providence side of the bridge are often used by dirt-bikers for recreational use. River Road exists beneath the Providence side of the bridge, and provides access to Blackstone Park and Trails (a breach in the fence-line on the westbound side of the bridge near the \\"South Angell Street\\" signage provides quick access into the park); (a short path on the eastbound side of the bridge before the ascent onto the bridge provides access to River Road). Repair work On April 17, 2008, it was reported that the bridge requires $50 million worth of repairs, but the state only had $3.3 million to allocate. Some problems noted are cracks in the concrete pier caps & rusting steel beams. RIDOT chief engineer Kazem Farhoumand has stated that steel reinforcements can be bolted onto the steel beams to make them \\"good for another 5 or 10 years.\\"Bridge Repair Article The Henderson was one of 25 bridges to receive \\"minor repairs\\" in late 2015, after a \\"hurry-up\\" program of bridge inspections in August 2015. =Replacement= Transit and bike advocates have asked for years that the bridge be replaced by a more multimodal structure.http://transportprovidence.blogspot.com/2014/03/east-providence-in- pretzel.html In February 2019 it was announced that the existing four lane bridge will be replaced with a new two lane bridge with pedestrian and bike lanes. The cost is an estimated $60‚Äì70 million, with $54.5 million coming from a federal spending bill and the rest from the state. It is expected that the bridge will retain its signature red color.

Podsafe is a term created in the podcasting community to refer to any work which, through its licensing, specifically allows the use of the work in podcasting, regardless of restrictions the same work might have in other realms. For example, a song may be legal to use in podcasts, but may need to be purchased or have royalties paid for over-the-air radio use, television use, and possibly even personal use. Podsafe music gained modest popularity in the early days of podcasting, largely because of podcaster resources like the now-defunct Podsafe Music Network. Most podcasters were just hobbyists at that point. In the early 2010s, the podcast industry professionalized with the advent of podcast-oriented media companies such as Earwolf. Some traditional media organizations such as NPR started making podcasting a major part of their strategy. As more money started pouring into the industry, the content diversified and podsafe music faded into obscurity. Definition of \\"podsafe\\" The effective definition of \\"podsafe\\" for a given work depends entirely on the contract through which the podcaster licenses the work; there is no single podsafe license. While some works (such as public domain works or works under some Creative Commons licenses) are inherently podsafe, the only actual requirement for a work to be podsafe is that any licensing requirements it has, if applicable, allow for the work's free use (typical broadcast use in its original form, if in no other form, depending on the specific license) in a podcast or web broadcast. This gives specific favor to podcasts only, allowing the artist to impose more traditional constraints on everyone else. Podsafe licensing can, for example, continue to require non-podcast consumers to pay for the work, require royalties on derivative works, and profit significantly from the work's use in traditional radio, television, or film. The licensor of any podsafe work must be legally capable of making it so. An artist cannot distribute his or her own work through a podsafe license if doing so would break any laws or breach any standing agreements (e.g. with the RIAA). The creator of a derivative work may also not claim this work podsafe without express permission from the original copyright holders. (PMN has more specific and stringent terms to this effect in its agreement.) Another point of contention is that not all podcasts are non-commercial works. Even in the early days, an increasing number of podcasts were taking on sponsors and looking to make a profit. In general, no significant distinction was made between podsafe for non-commercial use and podsafe for commercial use. Motives=For the podcaster= As podcasting grows more and more popular, illegal use of heavily licensed music (as through the RIAA) starts to grow at an extremely high pace. This is in general of greater concern to podcasters than to the typical sharer of music, because podcasters usually produce their shows for and promote them to the public. Including such licensed music legally has its own set of caveats. Many licensing agencies, if they do intend to allow the use of their music on podcasts, will require not only the payment of royalties but also the use of DRM on the shows. (DRM, because of its proprietary, system-specific nature, would be destructive to the general openness and system independence of podcasts.) Use of podsafe music instead of more stringently licensed material allows a podcaster to continue to produce an inexpensive, legal program with little hassle. Not least important for an independent podcaster is the promise of being able to avoid the confusing maze of licensing organizations. =For the artist= Conventional radio (and television) can present a difficult, and not always logical, barrier of entry for a musician or other media artist involving large sums of money and often a great deal of surrender in both ownership and creative freedom. In contrast, podcasting, an increasingly popular medium for audio programs, is more receptive to artists and input. While a conventional radio show may be able to replay a large part of its music selection from day to day, there would be little point in downloading a music podcast whose selection did not vary significantly from a previous show.

It debuted on September 6, 1986, as the flagship program of the WWF's syndicated programming. In January 2019, select episodes of WWF Superstars starting from April 1992 became available for streaming on the WWE Network. History=Early format= In September 1986, Superstars replaced WWF Championship Wrestling. Before that, WWF Superstars Of Wrestling was the name of a weekly recap show hosted by Vince McMahon (or Gene Okerlund) and Lord Alfred Hayes that lasted from 1984 through August 1986. The new version of Superstars was the program on which all the angles began and at times ended and on which the majority of title changes took place if not at a pay-per-view event (e.g. WrestleMania or SummerSlam). Matches primarily saw top tier and mid-level talent versus jobbers; pre-taped interviews with the WWF's roster of superstars; and promos featuring the wrestlers. At times, there was a \\"feature\\" match between main WWF talent. As with all syndicated WWF programming, another major aspect of the show was to promote house shows and TV tapings in each market. During its syndication run, the program was re-branded and aired in some parts of Canada as Maple Leaf Wrestling (essentially replacing a program of the same name filmed in southern Ontario), despite having almost no Canadian content other than interviews promoting matches that were to be held in Canada, along with occasional program-exclusive matches taped at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Ontario. However, this repackaging was, at the time, sufficient to allow the program to count towards Canadian content requirements for local television stations. Some Canadian viewers were able to watch American feeds of the show and/or \\"WWF Challenge.\\" The show also began airing in 1986 in the United Kingdom on Saturday nights on Sky Channel. For a short time, it was shown on Tuesdays on Eurosport. Early in the 1990s, it was featured in a Friday night time slot. In the mid-1990s, Superstars was then moved to a Sunday morning time slot. For most of it original run in the United Kingdom Gorilla Monsoon was the play-by- play commentator with various color commentators throughout its history. Beginning with the April 18, 1992 episode, the program was renamed to WWF Superstars, due to a successful lawsuit by another promoter, Albert Patterson, who had claimed prior rights to the phrase \\"Superstars of Wrestling\\". Since then, archival footage of the program has usually been shown with the words \\"of Wrestling\\" blurred out where applicable. =Change in format= In September 1996, Superstars left syndication and moved to pay TV channel USA Network in place of WWF Action Zone, which the network cancelled. Although for a brief period the show continued in its same format, as time went on more and more recaps of the WWF's other programming began to fill the hour. By March 1997, Superstars was solely a summary program and continued in that manner until its eventual ending. In 1997, the format of Superstars as aired in the United Kingdom also changed and began to only feature weekly summaries of Monday Night Raw. Following the premiere of SmackDown!, Superstars served as a summary show for SmackDown! as well. When the WWF moved its cable TV contract to TNN (later known as Spike, now known as the Paramount Network) in September 2000, Superstars moved with it. The show was then discontinued in August 2001. The show continued until December 2002 in the UK, until it was replaced by Heat in January 2003. Title changes Many of these title changes were not aired for up to several weeks after they took place. As these shows were aired in an era before the Internet was popularized, the previous title holder sometimes defended his title at house shows as though he were still the champion until the title change was aired on television. *The Hart Foundation (Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart and Jim \\"The Anvil\\" Neidhart) defeating the British Bulldogs (Dynamite Kid and Davey Boy Smith) for the WWF World Tag Team Championship on February 7, 1987 (taped January 26, 1987). *The Honky Tonk Man defeating Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on June 13, 1987 (taped June 2, 1987). *Strike Force (Rick Martel and Tito Santana) defeating the Hart Foundation for the WWF World Tag Team Championship on November 7, 1987 (taped October 27, 1987). *Demolition (Ax and Smash) defeating the Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard) for the WWF World Tag Team Championship on November 4, 1989 (taped October 2, 1989). *The Colossal Connection (Andr√© the Giant and Haku) defeating Demolition for the WWF World Tag Team Championship on December 30, 1989 (taped December 13, 1989). *Mr. Perfect defeating Tito Santana for the vacant WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on May 19, 1990 (taped April 23, 1990). *Mr. Perfect defeating Kerry Von Erich for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on December 15, 1990 (taped November 19, 1990). *Diesel defeating Razor Ramon for the WWF Intercontinental Championship on April 30, 1994 (taped April 13, 1994).

Albert Patterson, a Wisconsin independent wrestling promoter, successfully trademarked the phrase in 1993. Although there has been litigation between the WWE and Patterson, WWE has not been able to settle with Patterson for the usage of \\"Superstars of Wrestling\\". Due to this issue, WWE blurs the Superstars of Wrestling banners when archival content is shown on the WWE Network.

Ukrainian Baroque or Cossack Baroque or Mazepa Baroque is an architectural style that was widespread in the Ukrainian lands in the 17th- and 18th- centuries. It was the result of a combination of local architectural traditions and European Baroque. Ukrainian Baroque is distinct from the Western European Baroque in having more moderate ornamentation and simpler forms, and as such was considered more constructivist. Many Ukrainian Baroque buildings have been preserved, including several buildings in Kyiv Pechersk Lavra and the Vydubychi Monastery in Kiev. The best examples of Baroque painting are the church paintings in the Holy Trinity Church of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Rapid development in engraving techniques occurred during the Ukrainian Baroque period. Advances utilized a complex system of symbolism, allegories, heraldic signs, and sumptuous ornamentation. Ukrainian Baroque sculptor Johann Georg Pinsel, who was active during the mid-18th century in Galicia, was the subject of a special 2012‚Äì13 exhibition at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Pinsel, who demonstrated a unique, masterful expressiveness of form and a highly personal characterization of drapery is now recognized as a leading figure in European Baroque sculpture.

Early life Gano was born in Connecticut to actor parents Norman and Faye Gano. The Gano family moved to Wisconsin in 1973, when his father opened an American Baptist church in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee. Rev. Gano, an accomplished actor, also formed a community theater group in Oak Creek, and Gordon appeared in many of its productions, notably \\"Sing Out, Sweet Land\\" in 1976. His father played guitar, and exposed his son to a wide array of musical genres, including country and western, show tunes, and gospel. The liner notes to the Violent Femmes's compilation album Permanent Record describe Gano as \\"a devout Baptist\\". In 1979 the Gano family moved to nearby Hales Corners, where his father took over an existing American Baptist congregation. At this time Gordon began attending Milwaukee public school‚ÄîRufus King High School, from which he graduated in 1981. After graduating from high school, he worked briefly as an encyclopedia salesman. Older siblings from his parents' previous marriages living in the NYC area exposed the young Gano to such influences as The Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, Brian Eno, Patti Smith, Jonathan Richman, and The B-52's. Gordon's garage band days began with covers of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and moved through Grateful Dead (Hunter/Garcia) songs to Lou Reed and Velvet Underground songs by 1979. Gordon began writing his own songs in the mid '70s, influenced by the vocal stylings of Lou Reed, the story-telling of Hank Williams, Sr. and the poetics of Patti Smith's \\"Babelogue\\". Given his acting background, Gordon wrote many of his songs for characters, whom he would portray while performing the associated song. Career=Violent Femmes= 1990 Gano joined Violent Femmes in Milwaukee in 1981 with bassist Brian Ritchie and drummer Victor DeLorenzo. They soon developed an enthusiastic following thanks to songs such as \\"Blister in the Sun,\\" \\"Kiss Off\\" and \\"Add It Up\\" (all included on their self-titled debut album). The band has experimented with a variety of sounds over the course of its career, such as country and western (Hallowed Ground) and pop-rock (The Blind Leading the Naked). Gano plays guitar, sings and writes most of the band's songs. =Other projects= During a Violent Femmes hiatus in the late 1980s, Gano formed a gospel-punk group called The Mercy Seat with vocalist Zena Von Heppinstall, bassist Patrice Moran, and drummer Fernando Menendez. They toured internationally for two years and released a self-titled album in 1987 on Warner Music Group's Slash Records. The album was re-released digitally in 2009 on Wounded Bird Records. Gano released his first solo album in 2002, titled Hitting the Ground. He shared vocal duties with Manuel Cruz, lead singer of the Portuguese rock band Ornatos Violeta in the song \\"Capit√£o Romance,\\" with Gano singing in Portuguese. Gano also played violin on Ben Vaughn's 1990 album Dressed in Black. Gano contributed to the 2004 multi-artist collaboration The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered (alongside artists including Beck, The Eels, TV on the Radio and Death Cab for Cutie), on which he provides a rendition of Johnston's \\"Impossible Love.\\" Gano wrote, recorded and performed with ex-members of The Bogmen, Billy and Brendan Ryan, under the name Gordon Gano & The Ryans. Their only album, Under the Sun, was released in September 2009 on Yep Roc Records.

It is the second-largest of its type in Germany. The Senckenberg Museum is particularly popular with children, who enjoy the extensive collection of dinosaur fossils: Senckenberg boasts the largest exhibition of large dinosaurs in Europe. One notable exhibit is a dinosaur fossil with unique, preserved scaled skin. The museum contains a large and diverse collection of birds with 90,000 bird skins 5,050 egg sets 17,000 skeletons and 3,375 spirit specimens. In 2010, almost 517,000 people visited the museum. The building housing the Senckenberg Museum was erected between 1904 and 1907 outside of the center of Frankfurt in the same area as the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, which was founded in 1914. The museum is owned and operated by the Senckenberg Nature Research Society, which began with an endowment by Johann Christian Senckenberg. Diplodocus longus dinosaur model and columnar basalt in front of the Senckenberg Museum. Today, visitors are greeted outside the building by large, life-size recreations of dinosaurs, which are based on the latest scientific theories on dinosaur appearance. Inside, one can follow the tracks of a Titanosaurus, which have been impressed into the floor, towards its skeleton on a sheltered patio. Attractions include a Diplodocus (donated by the American Museum of Natural History on the occasion of the present museum building's inauguration in 1907), the crested Hadrosaur Parasaurolophus, a fossilized Psittacosaurus with clear bristles around its tail and visible fossilized stomach contents, and an Oviraptor. Big public attractions also include the Tyrannosaurus rex, an original of an Iguanodon, and the museum's mascot, the Triceratops. Original Triceratops skulls Giganotosaurus carolinii Although the dinosaurs attract the most visitors due to their size, the Senckenberg Museum also has a large collection of animal exhibits from every epoch of Earth's history. For example, the museum houses many originals from the Messel pit: field mice, reptiles, fish and a predecessor to the modern horse that lived about 50 million years ago and stood less than 60 cm tall. Unique in Europe is a cast of the famous Lucy, an almost complete skeleton of the upright hominid Australopithecus afarensis. Historical cabinets full of stuffed animals are arranged in the upper levels; among other things one can see one of twenty existing examples of the quagga, which has been extinct since 1883. Since the remodeling finished in 2003, the new reptile exhibit addresses both the biodiversity of reptiles and amphibians and the topic of nature conservation.

This article contains a list of major events related to organized crime. Events ‚Äì timeline=1830s= *1837 ‚Äì Chicago became incorporated as a city.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 8 =1850s= *1850 ‚Äì Chicago had a population of 80,000 people, but the city had no police force, only nine \\"watch marshals\\".Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 10 *1855 ‚Äì The city had a bare-bones police force. *1850s (late) ‚Äì Because Chicago was built over a swamp, mud constantly oozed from beneath the city's wooden streets. It was decided the whole city would be mudjacked 10 feet (3 metres) and the city would rest on stilts, with stones at the base. This led to the beginning of the free-wheeling crime sub- culture that overtook Chicago. After the city was raised, criminals in the area began practicing their trades in rooms and tunnels beneath the city. English immigrant Roger Plant, who ran a brothel in the Chicago netherworld called \\"Under the Willows\\", became the chief of this criminal underworld.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 9, 10 *Aug. 20, 1858 ‚Äì Michael \\"Hinky Dink\\" Kenna, one of the two \\"Lords of the Levee\\", was born. =1860s= *1860 ‚Äì Chicago's mayor, John \\"Long John\\" Wentworth, serving two non-consecutive two-year terms, reduced his police force to 60 officers. Criminals from other states moved to the city's \\"underworld\\". *Aug. 15, 1860 ‚Äì John \\"Bathhouse John\\" Coughlin, the second of the \\"Lords of the Levee\\", was born. *1868 - Sometime after the Civil War, gambler Michael Cassius McDonald moved to the city and later became what some consider Chicago's \\"first true crime lord\\". He began to appear in the newspapers of Chicago as early as November 1868, when The Chicago Tribune reported his arrest, along with national billiards champion John McDevitt and two other gamblers, for criminal conspiracy and the running of gambling dens after having apparently fleeced an intoxicated man out of more than $400 while playing faro.\\"Billiards and Faro: The Champion McDevitt, and Three Gamblers Arrested for Conspiracy,\\" The Chicago Tribune, Nov. 13, 1868; \\"Faro and Billiards: Partial Examination of McDevitt, Page, McDonald and Swift,\\" The Chicago Tribune, Nov. 14, 1868. =1870s= *Oct. 8, 1871 ‚Äì Much of the city's population lost everything, including for 300 people their lives, to a fire that lasted 36 hours and brought rampant looting.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 11 *1879 ‚Äì Michael Cassius McDonald, lived in the midst of what was called \\"Hair- Trigger Block,\\" was a gambling kingpin who understood the power of a bribe. Also politically motivated, he brought his underworld friends and associates together to form \\"McDonald's Democrats\\" and got Carter Harrison, Sr., elected as mayor in this year. McDonald gained control of all of Chicago and the State of Indiana's bookmaking rights. His gambling joint, \\"The Store\\", was considered by some, whom the author of the book doesn't name, to be Chicago's, \\"unofficial City Hall\\". McDonald and his men are credited with the term: \\"Syndicate\\", because of the gang's \\"crime consortium\\".Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 10, 11 =1880s= *1882 ‚Äì Michael \\"Hinkey Dink\\" Kenna opened a First Ward saloon.Michael \\"Hinkey Dink\\" Kenna *1882 ‚Äì Chicago Police Chief William McGarigle, in the pay of Chicago crime lord Michael Cassius McDonald, was indicted for graft and later fled to Canada. *1882? ‚Äì John \\"Mushmouth\\" Johnson opened the Emporium Saloon and gambling establishment, began his reign as Chicago's first South Side Policy racket king.John \\"Mushmouth\\" Johnson and the Policy RacketJohn V.

He and another North Side Gang boss-to-be, Dion O'Banion, became childhood friends. Moran \\"had committed 26 known robberies\\" and \\"served three incarcerations\\" before age 21. He hated the city's flesh trade and regularly attended church.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 252, 253 *1892 ‚Äì Born in this year, future North Side Gang leader Dion O'Banion was raised on Chicago's Near North Side, in \\"Little Hell\\", a section of the city that was later used to build the Cabrini-Green housing project, now demolished to make way for urban renewal. O'Banion was a street tough, working for the Chicago Tribune, then Hearst newspapers, threatening and terrorizing those who sold competitors' newspapers. It is speculated that O'Banion committed more than 60 murders in his lifetime.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 278‚Äì280Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 28 *April 5, 1892 ‚Äì \\"Bathhouse John\\" Coughlin was elected a First Ward alderman.\\"Bathhouse John\\" Coughlin and Michael \\"Hinkey Dink\\" Kenna *1893 ‚Äì Coughlin and Michael \\"Hinky Dink\\" Kenna ‚Äì \\"Lords of the Levee\\" ‚Äì \\"form an alliance\\", ruling the First Ward, which, commercially, was the \\"most important ward in the city\\" until 1992, when the districts were redrawn.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 20‚Äì23 *1893 ‚Äì Chicago's South Side Levee District opened for business to serve customers who weren't only in the city for the World's Columbian Exposition. *1894 ‚Äì Frank Brunell founded The Daily Racing Form in Chicago. *1895 ‚Äì Unione Siciliane was created in New York City in the 1880s as a fraternal organization and a legitimate business to sell insurance, help with housing, help learn English, settle legal disputes (even with the Black Handers) and do a number of other tasks to equip immigrant Sicilians with their new lives in America. The Chicago branch was chartered in the mid-1890s; and, apparently from its beginning, 25,000 Sicilians who lived in the city and 500,000 Sicilians who lived in Cook County, Illinois, were under the umbrella of Unione Siciliane's Chicago branch, which was a tremendous influence on the people it served and therefore was highly coveted for control by so many of the city's gangs.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 22, 23 *1895 ‚Äì Future master pimp Giacomo \\"Big Jim\\" Colosimo immigrated to Chicago, at about age 17, with his parents. Colosimo had no known criminal record when coming to America.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 92, 93Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 16 *1896 ‚Äì The first of its kind \\"First Ward Ball\\", masterminded by businessman Michael \\"Hinkey Dink\\" Kenna and Alderman John Couglin, first made an appearance in the CityThe First Ward Ball *1897 ‚Äì Michael \\"Hinkey Dink\\" Kenna became a First Ward alderman. *1898 ‚Äì Future North Side Gang leader \\"Hymie Weiss\\" (Earl Wajciechowski) was born. A well-rounded crook, capable of accomplishing many criminal trades, Weiss was also a childhood friend of Dion O'Banion. Weiss has been credited with the gangland term, \\"take for a ride (a one-way ride)\\".Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 316, 379, 380 =1900s= *1900 ‚Äì Because checking the immigration status of immigrants became so lax, more than two million unchecked people lived in the city by this year. *1900A second source reports that the Gennas came to America as late as 1910; Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 22 ‚Äì Six Sicilian brothers ‚Äì (\\"Bloody\\") Angelo, Mike (\\"The Devil\\"), Pete, Sam, Jim and Tony (\\"the Gentleman\\") ‚Äì the \\"Bloody Gennas\\" ‚Äì immigrated to America. They settled in Chicago's Little Italy in a section called \\"The Patch\\". The brothers became the \\"Black Hand\\" extortionists. Two of the gang's earliest gunmen were Sicilians Albert Anselmi and John Scalise.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 150, 151 *1900 ‚Äì Future Outfit boss Ross Prio (Rosario Priolo), was born in Sicily.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 296, 297 *Feb. 1, 1900 ‚Äì The Everleigh Club, run by Madams Ada and Minna Everleigh\\" (Ada and Minna Simms), at 2131‚Äì2133 S. Dearborn Street, opened its doors in Chicago's Levee District. *Dec. 16, 1903 ‚Äì The Lone Star Saloon, on south State Street, was shut down after the owner/manager, Michael Finn, was found to have been drugging patrons' drinks for years in order to rob them. This was an orchestrated effort with the help of his saloon workers. This practice became known in popular culture as giving someone a \\"Mickey Finn\\". *Apr. 28, 1906 ‚Äì The Chicago Outfit's Boss-of-bosses for almost a half-century, Tony Accardo (Antonino Leonardo Accardo), was born in Chicago to a Sicilian-immigrant shoemaker and his Sicilian-immigrant wife, who both settled in America in 1905. At the time of Tony Accardo's birth, the family lived at 1353 Grand Avenue. The infant Accardo was baptized at Holy Name Cathedral, on Chicago Avenue and State Street. He was the second oldest of six siblings.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 17, 18 *1907 ‚Äì With the country's \\"biggest handbook center\\" in Chicago, Mont Tennes was the nation's undisputed gambling \\"czar\\", under the umbrella and with the blessing of First Ward aldermen John Coughlin and Michael Kenna. Tennes also controlled the nation's race wire system, which was important for horserace betting across the country at the time. Control of the race wire led to a very maniacal public dispute between the interested parties in the summer of 1907, including bombings. Tennes' own home was bombed.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 21‚Äì24 *1907 ‚Äì A group of leading Italian citizens, prominent businessmen, several ethnic organizations and the Italian Chamber of Commerce formed the White Hand Society, a legal organization, to combat the Black Hand in Chicago. *1907 ‚Äì Chicago gambling racketeer Bud White's controversial gambling boat City of Traverse was closed down after years of legally trying to stay afloat.\\"City of Traverse\\" *Sept. 1907 ‚Äì A grand jury convened concerning the violence which had taken place during the summer over Chicago's race wire business. Two of the findings were that Chicago's mayor, Fred Busse, and the city's police chief, George Shippy, were bought by Tennes' racket.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 21, 22 *1908 ‚Äì The Chicago Coliseum sustained heavy damage from a bomb blast two weeks ahead of that year's \\"First Ward Ball\\", after the ball received increasing disdain through the years from the city's respectable and innocent citizens. Despite the blast, the ball was held there anyway. It's not known what, if any, information was found as to who was responsible for the bombing.Alderman Michael \\"Hinkey Dink\\" Kenna *1908 ‚Äì Future North Side Gang leader Earl \\"Hymie\\" Weiss was first arrested for burglary in Chicago. Weiss was caught robbing a perfume store and was immediately dubbed the \\"Perfume Burglar\\" by reporters. *May 24, 1908 ‚Äì According to the Chicago Bureau of Vital Statistics, Outfit front boss Sam Giancana was born, Gilormo Giangana, on this date and lived in Chicago's \\"Patch\\", west of the city's \\"Loop\\", on south Aberdeen Street. His parents immigrated from Castelvetrano, Sicily, some years earlier. However, whatever city records state about Giancana's birth date, he and his family celebrated his birthday on June 15. His baptismal records also show his birth date was June 15, 1908, with the given name Momo Salvatore Giancana.Giancana, Antoinette and Thomas C. Renner, Mafia Princess: Growing Up in Sam Giancana's Family, William Morrow and Company, Inc. (1984), p. 30 *1909 ‚Äì North Side Gang leader Dion O'Banion was imprisoned three months for robbery.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 278 *1909 ‚Äì After enduring the \\"First Ward Ball\\" for over a decade, citizens groups pressured Mayor Fred Busse into putting an end to the \\"debauched\\" extravaganza in this year. =1910s= *1910 ‚Äì Chicago police arrested over 200 known Italian gangsters and known Black Hand members in a raid in Little Italy. However, none of them were convicted as many of the notes of extortion threats could not be traced to those men. *Jan. 1, 1910 ‚Äì March 26, 1911 ‚Äì Thirty-eight people were killed by Black Hand assassins, many by the unidentified assassin known only as \\"Shotgun Man\\", between Oak Street and Milton Street ‚Äì \\"Death's Corner\\" ‚Äì in Chicago's Little Italy.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 108, 337, 338 *Mar. 15, 1910 ‚Äì The Chicago Vice Commission was organized by Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison, Jr., to be able to bring an end to the Levee District brothels and panel houses. *1911 ‚Äì A young Filippo Sacco (\\"Johnny Roselli\\"), immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, from Italy, with his mother. Sacco's father had already immigrated there. Sacco later became the Outfit's man in Hollywood and Las Vegas. *1911 ‚Äì Again, North Side Gang leader Dion O'Banion was imprisoned three months for a \\"concealed weapons\\" conviction. *Aug. 1911 ‚Äì By this time, there were 50 gambling establishments in the Loop. Respectable hotels hosted some form of gambling to draw patrons. According to the source's author, every block in the Loop had a gambling house in one form or another. Mont Tennes managed, oversaw, controlled it all, through his lieutenant, Mike \\"de Pike\\" Heitler. The only police raids that ever occurred at this time were on gambling establishments that competed with Tennes.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 22 *Oct. 24, 1911 ‚Äì Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison, Jr., ordered the Everleigh Club closed down permanently, after the Everleigh sisters' fame and good fortune prompted them into distributing brochures for their brothel in respectable hotels and restaurants, where visitors to the city stayed and ate. Other brothels were then raided and closed in Chicago, which brought violence. The building which housed the Everleighs' brothel stood until July 1933, when it was demolished.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 23 *1912 ‚Äì By this time, \\"Big Jim\\" Colosimo, then married to a brothel madam, controlled 200 prostitution houses. Colosimo took his place in Chicago's criminal history after becoming a leader in the city's Street Laborers Union and City Street Repairers Union ‚Äì doing \\"honest work\\". He had already formed his own social club. Thus, Colosimo didn't go unnoticed by the Coughlin‚ÄìKenna political machine, who was looking to expand its votes base to other ethnic groups. It took Colosimo under its wing. When Colosimo began delivering big results, the First Ward \\"Machine\\" gave Colosimo \\"protected status\\". He became Democratic precinct captain. Police could not bother Colisimo, whatever he was doing. And, what he began doing was picking up brothel pay-offs for the \\"Machine\\".Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 16, 17 *Jan. 18, 1912 ‚Äì Jim Cosmano, a major Chicago Black Hand leader, was severely wounded in an ambush by Johnny Torrio, near the 22nd Street police station. Cosmano had previously demanded $10,000, threatening to destroy Colosimo's Cafe if he didn't receive the money.Chicago Tribune, January 19, 1912 *July 18, 1914 ‚Äì The closing of Levee brothels had incited violence in the area for some time, and on this day brought about the death of Police Detective Sergeant Stanley Birns and the wounding of a second officer. The Chicago Tribune entered the fray and directly blamed Michael Kenna and Police Captain Michael Ryan, who was dubbed, \\"Chief of Police of the First Ward\\", for the violence.Roemer, Jr., William, F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 23 *Nov. 7, 1914 ‚Äì Outfit extortionist, counterfitter and robber Charles Carmen Inglese (\\"Chuckie English\\") was born.Giancana, Antoinette and Thomas C. Renner, Mafia Princess: Growing Up in Sam Giancana's Family, William Morrow and Company, Inc. (1984), p. 295 *1915 ‚Äì Boston, Massachusetts-born William Hale \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson, \\"politically unknown at the time\\", was elected mayor of Chicago with the help of Chicago powerbrokers William Lorimer and Fred Ludin. Thompson was in office for two consecutive terms, then lost, or withdrew from ‚Äì depending on the source, the 1923 election which was won by reform candidate and Massachusetts-born William Dever. Thompson ran again in 1927 with $250,000 of help from Al Capone, won, then, was defeated again in 1931, by Anton Cermak. That was Thompson's final term. His time as mayor brought brazen corruption to the Mayor's Office and to the city. He promised the underworld and upperworld powers that were at the time \\"a wide-open city\\", which translated to: any vice, any corruption ‚Äì any time. \\"An unabashed defier of Volstead\\", Thompson was also a key member of the Sportsman's Club. This group actively solicited bribes from all of the various Chicago underworld figures and also solicited their memberships in the club, including that of brothel racketeer Jim Colosimo. In addition to the underworld members, it also had Charles Healy, Chicago's chief of police, and Morgan Collins, a Chicago police captain as members.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 23, 24Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 38 *1915 (approximately) ‚Äì After future Outfit powerbroker Johnny Torrio had made numerous trips to Chicago to do \\"mob chores\\" for his uncle through marriage, racketeer and \\"the biggest whoremaster in the city\\", Jim Colosimo, Colosimo brought Torrio to Chicago permanently to run Colosimo's \\"houses\\", the kind of work Torrio was already doing for himself in New York. Colosimo's business thrived under Torrio.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 360‚Äì362 *1916 ‚Äì The Illinois State's Attorney's office began an investigation of the Sportsman's Club.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 24 *Jan. 16, 1917 ‚Äì Indictments were handed down by the Illinois State's Attorney's office charging eight men with bribery and graft concerning the Sportsman's Club. The eight were: Chief of Police Charles Healy, Police Captain Tom Costello, Tennes' gambling lieutenant Mike \\"de Pike\\" Heitler, William Skidmore, a saloon keeper, a gambler, a well-known politician of the time and two police officers. *1919 ‚Äì By this year, Jim Colosimo was one of the \\"overlords of the underworld\\", in Chicago, \\"though there were others who operated in spheres of influence\\" in the city.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 25 *1919 ‚Äì Interested parties, including local businessmen and private citizens fed-up with rampant local thuggery and murder in the city formed the Chicago Crime Commission, founded by Chicago Attorney Frank J. Loesch. In the 1920s, he was the one to coin the term, \\"Public Enemy\\", concerning Chicago's organized crime figures. In the 1930s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) started using this term for the hoodlums and \\"n'er-do-wells\\" who would plague various parts of the nation.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 220 *Jan. 16, 1919 ‚Äì The Eighteenth Amendment (Prohibition) was passed at the federal level, redefining American law. One calendar year was given to drinking establishments, breweries, etc., across the nation to close down. Drinking any alcohol was not, however, prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 6, 7 *July 27, 1919 ‚Äì A full-scale race riot began in Chicago, with accompanying arsons, lootings and murders. The riot was initiated when a gang of racist thugs known as \\"Ragen's Colts\\", which started as a baseball team formed by two brothers, threw stones at and drowned an African-American swimmer who had strayed into the segregated \\"White\\" area of a South Side beach.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 304, 305 The riot ended on Aug. 3, 1919. *Oct. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1919 ‚Äì The 1919 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and the Cincinnati Reds, played in part at Comiskey Park, had its memory forever tarnished when it was verified that a group of Sox players conspired to \\"throw\\" the series for financial gain. In the aftermath of the series scandal, eight Sox players were banned for life from professional baseball, even if they only knew about the \\"fix\\", but yet didn't participate. The players were: Arnold \\"Chick\\" Gandil, \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson (questionable involvement at best), Eddie Cicotte, Claude \\"Lefty\\" Williams, Oscar \\"Happy\\" Felsch, Charles \\"Swede\\" Risberg, Buck Weaver and Fred McMullin. The 1919 Sox have been referred to as the \\"Chicago Black Sox\\" since that time. Finally, though always denying publicly that he had any part in the 1919 World Series \\"fix\\", New York City rackeeter and gambler Arnold Rothstein has been repeatedly mentioned over the decades as the one who financed this scheme to \\"throw\\" the 1919 series, in order to personally reap a financial windfall through betting on the series.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 321, 322 *1919 (late) ‚Äì Johnny \\"The Fox\\" Torrio brought his cousin and Al Capone from New York City to Chicago to help with business, after he faced a couple of murder charges in New York.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 23 *1919 ‚Äì Under the tutelage of forward-thinking racketeer Johnny Torrio, Al Capone stood in front of Jim Colosimo's multi-use house of prostitution the, \\"Four Deuces\\", at 2222 S. Wabash Avenue, barkering to male passers-by to enjoy what \\"Big Jim's\\" business had to offer. Johnny Torrio also ran Colosimo's holdings from that building. Pre-Prohibition, Colosimo's influence through Torrio, by then into suburban Chicago as well, had given Colosimo holdings of more than \\"a thousand gambling joints, brothels and saloons\\". Estimates are that Colosimo-Torrio was grossing $4 million a year at that time.pp.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), 139, 140Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 18, 19 =1920s= *1920s ‚Äì By this decade, with the encouragement and allowance of First Ward aldermen John Coughlin and Michael \\"Hinkey Dink\\" Kenna \\"more than 100 gambling and bookie joints\\" thrived in the Levee District, and there were 800 more throughout the city. The opening up of houses of prostitution \\"spread like wildfire\\". Coughlin and Kenna had such a grip on what went on in the ward, not \\"a cop or a city inspector\\" could succeed making a move against them. The bribes totalled $60,000 a year, $10,000 more a year than when the aldermen hosted the, \\"First Ward Ball\\".Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 15, 16 *1920 ‚Äì Perfected in this year, the Thompson submachine gun, or the \\"Tommy Gun\\", aka, \\"the Chicago typewriter\\", became the weapon of choice for at least some of the city's mobster gangs. The Saltis‚ÄìMcErlane Gang was the first to use this gun in Chicago.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 360Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 31 *1920 ‚Äì Future Outfit consigliere \\"Paul Ricca\\" (Felice DeLucia) came to America from Sicily, at age 23, and eventually landed in Chicago, after serving two years in an Italian prison for murder, at age 17. After his prison sentence, Ricca murdered the witness against him whose testimony put him in prison. Ricca was suspected of killing others, but nothing ever came of any of that.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 313, 314 *1920 ‚Äì 14-year-old Tony Accardo's parents filed paperwork with the authorities claiming young Accardo was two years older so that he could leave school and go to work, an apparently common practice in that day.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 18 *Jan. 16, 1920 ‚Äì Prohibition (\\"Volstead Act\\") took effect for 13 years. While all legitimate establishments that served alcohol had to close because of Prohibition, it's estimated that 200,000 speakeasies sprang up across the country to take their places. Between 1920 and 1928 the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversaw bringing bootlegged alcohol-making gangs ‚Äì which included bathtub gin made by locals ‚Äì to justice, fired 706 agents and prosecuted another 257 agents for taking bribes related to Prohibition alcohol. In Chicago, Prohibition had some professionals scrambling. Fifteen thousand doctors and 57,000 druggists \\"applied for 'medicinal' liquor licenses\\", and sacramental wine sales rose by 800,000 gallons the first year of the new law.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 298‚Äì320Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 19 *1920? ‚Äì With the dawning of Prohibition, the Genna brothers decided to switch from extorting the wealthy to producing illegal alcohol (with help from many Italian and Sicilian families in Little Italy). Having only a permit to make industrial-grade alcohol, they took the finished product, put additives in it to make it palatable, then labelled it whatever they wanted ‚Äì gin, bourbon, etc. Drinking the brothers' alcohol was known, even at that time, to \\"cause psychosis\\".Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 22 The Gennas' base of operations was an alcohol processing plant at 1022 Taylor Street, in \\"The Patch\\", where allegedly the Gennas openly paid monthly bribes to a large number of police from the neighborhood Maxwell Street precinct and even had money left over for few men in the state attorney's office. *Feb. 2, 1920 ‚Äì Labor racketeer Maurice \\"Mossy\\" Enright was killed near his South Side home. *May 11, 1920 ‚Äì Three weeks after marrying his second wife, gambling racketeer and \\"whoremaster\\" Jim Colosimo was gunned down in the lobby of his self-named restaurant at 2126 S. Wabash Avenue, supposedly waiting for a shipment of some kind. Nobody was ever charged with the murder. Police considered the \\"prime suspect\\" to be New York City gangster and Torrio‚ÄìCapone ally Frankie Yale. At Colosimo's funeral, there was an open, obvious mix of gangsters and politicians at the \\"lavish\\" affair. Aldermen Coughlin and Kenna were kneeling before the coffin.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 390‚Äì392Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 20, 20n *1921 ‚Äì Within a fraction of time of Jim Colosimo's murder, Johnny Torrio had brokered a deal with all the city's major gangs to share the city's Prohibition wealth by dividing the city into territories that each gang had a piece of. Only the South Side O'Donnell Gang refused to come to the table. The gang was shortly thereafter eliminated. Within weeks of Colosimo's murder, Torrio had moved into the suburbs with his \\"army\\" stock of gambling, girls and booze. He persuaded the Gennas and Unione Siciliana to side with him, even though Torrio wasn't Sicilian.Russo, Gus, \\"The Outfit\\", Bloomsbury (2001), p. 21 *1921? ‚Äì After the Torrio organization partnered with the Gennas, buying whatever alcohol the brothers could produce, taking in shipments of Canadian liquor, and adding the \\"vice\\" element to his organization, Torrio brought in $10 million a year, with the blessing of Unione Siciliana president Michele \\"Mike\\" Merlo, now a Torrio friend.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 22, 23 *Apr. 15, 1921 ‚Äì Sam Cardinelli, extortionist and \\"Black Hand\\" leader, was executed by the State of Illinois for the murder of a saloon owner, after a challenge to the execution was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. *1922 ‚Äì Publishing magnate Moses L. \\"Moe\\" Annenberg bought the rights to The Daily Racing Form.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 15, 16 *Mar. 22, 1922 ‚Äì Tony Accardo was arrested for a \\"motor vehicle violation\\" just before his 16th birthday. This was his first known arrest. *1923 ‚Äì Al Capone established his headquarters at the Lexington Hotel, at the corner of east 22nd Street (Cermak Road) and south Michigan Avenue, in Chicago. He also gained control of the Chicago suburb of Cicero, Illinois, as a \\"safe base\\" for his illegal operations. *1923 ‚Äì Because of city political reforms, the number of aldermen per ward was reduced from two to one.

At the time, the alleged leaders of the gang were Claude Maddox (\\"Screwy Moore\\"), Anthony \\"Tough Tony\\" Capezio, and Vincenzo De Mora (\\"'Machine-Gun Jack' McGurn\\"). Accardo steadily rose in the gang by going from pickpocketing, to doing home invasions, to driving trucks loaded with Prohibition alcohol. He was arrested eight times before age 21 while the young tough was with the gang, mostly for disorderly conduct.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 18, 19 *Sept. 17, 1923 ‚Äì George Meegan, a Chicago bootlegger allied with the Southside O'Donnells, and Southside O'Donnell member George Bucher were killed by Frank McErlane. *1924 ‚Äì Prosperous Irish mobsters Paddy Lake and Terry Druggan, of Chicago's little-known Valley Gang, each got a year in jail for contempt of court.

What O'Banion didn't tell Torrio was that O'Banion knew the brewery was to be raided by the authorities, thus bringing beer production to a screeching halt and bringing possible jailtime for the apprehended brewery owners.Torrio duped by O'Banion *Nov. 8, 1924, Legitimate Unione Siciliana President Mike Merlo died of cancer. Of all of the Chicago \\"talking heads\\" of the day people would gravitate to, Merlo was one who tried to foster \\"peace\\" and civility among the warring Chicago gangs.

Morton's gangster buddies got the last word and exacted gangster revenge on the horse. The \\"hit\\" was planned by \\"Louis 'Two Guns' Alterie\\" (Leland A. Varain).Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 8, 259 *1925 ‚Äì Joey \\"Babe Ruth\\" Colaro organized what would become Chicago's infamous, \\"42-Gang\\", which would become a virtual \\"farm team\\" for the ranks of the Chicago Outfit. This group of street delinquents would seem to do anything for a \\"buck\\", or to impress the \\"ladies\\". A number of these outlaws were recruited into the Outfit, with some of them making it into its highest ranks, including: Sam Battaglia, Felix Alderisio, Sam DeStefano, Marshall Caifano and his brother, Leonard, Charles Nicoletti, Fifi Buccieri, Albert Frabotta, William Aloisio, Frank Caruso, William Daddano, Joe Caesar DiVarico, Rocco Potenza, Leonard Gianola, Vincent Inserro and Sam Giancana.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury, (2001) pp. 180, 181Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 138, 139 *1925 ‚Äì Outfit front man and \\"42-Gang\\" graduate Sam \\"Momo\\" Giancana's arrest record consisted of more than 70 criminal offenses by this year.

Both limousines were fired on in a hail of gunfire, but neither Capone, nor Torrio were hurt. However, Torrio's chauffeur and dog were killed in the attack.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 379, 380 *Jan. 24, 1925 ‚Äì North Side Gang members again ambush Johnny Torrio as he returned from a Loop shopping trip with his wife. The gunmen shot him several times and wounded him and his chauffeur, Robert Barton. As George Moran was about to kill the wounded Torrio, the gun misfired and Moran was forced to flee as police arrived on the scene. For two weeks after he was shot, it looked like Torrio would die, but he recovered.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 32 *Feb. 9, 1925 ‚Äì Johnny Torrio was sentenced by Judge Adam Cliffe to nine months in the Lake County, Illinois, jail, in Waukegan, for being the owner of the Sieben Brewery when it was raided by the authorities. The jail was supposedly chosen by Torrio's lawyers as a facility necessary for Torrio to receive proper medical treatment for gunshot wounds; however, the jail was actually chosen for Torrio's protection as the prison warden, Sheriff Edwin Ahlstrom, was in the pay of Torrio's organization. Torrio was later escorted by Capone out of the city after his release. After much time to reflect in jail, Torrio decided the gangland empire he was trying to build was too risky, personally. He handed the entire works to Capone. When Torrio left the city for Brooklyn, New York, for good, at the end of 1925, or in early 1926, he took $30 million with him. *1925 (Spring) ‚Äì One year after Republican Joseph Klenha won the mayor's office of Cicero with Torrio and Capone's support, Klenha vowed in print to \\"run his office independently of the gangster element\\". Al Capone went to the Cicero City Hall and beat the mayor unconscious in full view of the police, who did nothing to Capone. Thus, Capone became Cicero's \\"de facto mayor\\". At risk to the Torrio‚ÄìCapone machine were 100 saloons and 150 gambling establishments installed in Cicero since Klenha had taken office.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 26 Note: It's not known if Johnny Torrio had left Chicago's organized crime scene by this point, because he would have still been in jail. *1925?‚Äì'26?‚Äì'27? Top dog in the Chicago underworld, Al Capone's organization was pulling in $105 million a year. Adding flash to his personality, Capone began buying $5,000 suits and custom fedoras at some point along the way.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 26, 27 *May 25, 1925 ‚Äì \\"Bloody Angelo\\" Genna was murdered after being followed in his car by the North Side Gang and Genna smashing into a lamppost after being chased. Someone then stepped out of the other car and shot Genna to death. Apparently, nobody was charged with the gangster's murder. *June? 1925 ‚Äì A month after his brother's death, Mike Genna and Genna Family members Albert Anselmi and John Scalise, who had secretly switched alliances to Al Capone, were going for \\"a ride\\", where Genna was unknowingly going to be killed. During the drive, the gangsters got involved in a shoot-out with police. Genna was wounded and immobile, and Anselmi and Scalise bolted from the scene. Mike Genna died two hours later. Two cops also died because of the shoot-out. Following Mike Genna's killing, brother Tony Genna was killed by a trusted friend, after Tony Genna went into hiding following Mike Genna's death. Tony Genna's death ended the Genna crime family for good.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp150,151 *1925 ‚Äì Sometime after Angelo Genna's murder, professional fiddler and gangster Samuzzo \\"Samoots\\" Amatuna walked into the Chicago branch of Unione Siciliane and declared himself the winner of the local chapter elections that hadn't happened yet. Al Capone became furious at Amatuna for this, because Capone had his own guy in mind for the job, Antonio Lombardo (\\"Tony the Scourge\\"). *Nov. 13, 1925 ‚Äì Samuzzo Amatuna, an ally of the \\"Bloody Gennas\\", was gunned down after sitting down in a Cicero, Illinois, barber shop chair, allegedly by North Side Gang members Jim Doherty and Vincent Drucci. Amatuna died at the hospital, before he could marry his fianc√©e. Al Capone then had Tony Lombardo installed as president of the local chapter of Unione Siciliana. *1925?‚Äì'26 ‚Äì Realizing Outfit boss Al Capone was a \\"train wreck\\", according to one biographer, Capone mentor Johnny Torrio returned to Brooklyn, New York, and began work on, \\"The Commission\\", realizing that having a centralized ruling body overseeing organized crime in America would bring the overseers untold wealth and power and ultimately give more wealth to ‚Äì and, in theory, produce less violence among ‚Äì the individual crime families. The meeting took place at New York City's Park Avenue Hotel. The participants included: \\"Charles 'Lucky' Luciano\\" (Salvatore Lucania), who masterminded New York's five crime families and was the Genovese crime family's first boss, Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter, who went on to head-up organized crime's assassins- for-hire group, \\"Murder, Inc.\\", Abner \\"Longy\\" Zwillman, who was a \\"Prohibition gangster\\" and who also went on to be a member of \\"Murder, Inc.\\", \\"Joe Adonis\\" (Giuseppi Antonio Doto), was one of the key criminal minds in beginnings of 20th-century American organized crime, \\"Frank Costello (\\"The Prime Minister\\", Francesco Castiglia), a powerful gangster who also went on to head the Genovese crime family, \\"Meyer 'The Brain' Lansky\\" (Meyer Suchowljansky), known as the \\"Mob's accountant\\" and a good friend and business associate of \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, and Abe \\"Kid Twist\\" Reles, allegedly the 'most feared' member of Murder, Inc. This meeting was reported in The New York Times, in 1935, and was, \\"ratted out\\", by one of the participants, Reles, in 1941. Following Reles' revelation, he either jumped or was forced out of a hotel room window. He died from the fall.Russo, Gus, Russo, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 32‚Äì34 *1926 ‚Äì Beginning this year, forces from Chicago to Washington, D.C., had been at work to \\"dethrone\\" gangster Al Capone. With \\"The Big Guy\\" being the lead name of those who were turning the city into a shooting gallery, Chicago Loop banker, Rufus C. Dawes, and his brother, Vice President of the United States Charles Dawes, under President Calvin Coolidge, launched an all- out assault on Capone. The brothers' reason was clear. Rufus Dawes was president of the World's Fair Corporation at the time, which would bring the Century of Progress to the city, in 1933. Fear of being hurt or killed by gang gunfire while in the city could affect attendance, and the fair and showcasing Chicago life and business could be a financial disaster for the city and state. Capone had to be removed. The Dawes' lobbied both Coolidge and his successor, President Herbert Hoover. By May 1927, the brothers had handed to them \\"the goose that laid the golden egg\\", which would allow the feds to nab Capone and put him away for a long time.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 44‚Äì46 *Apr. 27, 1926 ‚Äì After the South Side O'Donnells had been inching their way in on Al Capone's Chicago territory for a while, then in on Cicero, Illinois, Capone had had enough. With five cars and 29 gangsters, he went to greet the O'Donnells at Cicero's Pony Inn. No O'Donnell member was wounded, however. Capone's men did kill an assistant state's attorney who had been drinking with the O'Donnells. Realizing the gravity of what had taken place, Capone hid out in Michigan for a time. While Capone was in hiding, not only was the tide of citizen sentiment turning against him, police \\"sought reprisal, ransacking Capone's speakeasies, gambling joints and whorehouses, some beyond repair\\". His cash cow Cicero whorehouse was reduced ashes by a fire. While six grand juries addressed the attorney's killing, no indictments followed.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 35, 36 *July 1926 ‚Äì When Capone returned to the city after hiding out, he went to the Cicero police who wanted to question him about the assistant state's attorney's killing. Capone responded with an apparently unconvincing line that he didn't kill the attorney, and he'd \\"liked the \\"kid\\" so much, Capone had personally given the attorney a bottle of alcohol for his father the day before the murder.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 36 *Sept. 20, 1926 ‚Äì Using 10 cars in a successive motorcade, North Side Gang leader Hymie Weiss and his crew ambushed Outfit boss Al Capone with a cavalcade of bullets during his stop at the Hawthorne Inn in Cicero. Capone, being protected by his bodyguard Frank Rio, didn't have a scratch on him, neither did Rio. A Capone gunman, Louis Barko, and an innocent bystander, outside in a car during the attack, were slightly injured. Capone gave the injured bystander $5,000 for her medical bills. When Capone was asked who was responsible for that drive-by shooting, he reportedly said \\"Watch the morgue. They'll show up there.\\"Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 173, 174, 259, 260, 379, 380 *Oct. 4, 1926 ‚Äì In a show of magnanimity, Capone sent out RSVP invitations to host a citywide gang summit as Johnny Torrio had done. However, still enraged because of Dion O'Banion's murder, Hymie Weiss responded he'd be at the summit \\"with grenades exploding and guns blasting\\". He also wanted the heads of O'Banion's killers, something Capone would never have given up. *Oct. 11, 1926 ‚Äì Three weeks after the last assassination attempt on Al Capone and one week following his summit invite, Hymie Weiss and his bodyguard were gunned down and three bystanders were wounded when the gangsters walked into their gang's clubhouse, the second floor of gangster Dion O'Banion's old flower shop, on north State Street. Weiss' estate was valued at over $1.3 million. Across the street from O'Banion's flower shop, Holy Name Cathedral still bears the bullet holes today from the ambush on Weiss. *Oct. 20, 1926 ‚Äì Capone's gangland conference took place as planned, at the Hotel Sherman, across the street from a \\"chief of police headquarters\\". All of the major city gangs attended, and a still living North Side Gang member presented the conference's opening talk. But, the conference's goodwill was temporary.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 27 *1927 ‚Äì A study found that in the city, 1,313 gangs existed, claiming 25,000 members.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 12 *1927 ‚Äì Outfit heavyweight Paul Ricca got married. Al Capone was his best man. *1927 ‚Äì Highly ineffective and short-lived against the criminal gangs who were raging against the city at the time, Chicago police tried to stop the criminals by employing groups of police officers who would be ready to shoot known criminals with machine guns at the drop of a hat. This group of officers was known as, \\"O'Connor's Gunners\\", after Chicago Police Chief of Detectives William O'Connor.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 280, 281 *1927 ‚Äì Sam Valante, recently hired by Joe Aiello, was killed while arriving in Chicago. *Jan. 26, 1927 ‚Äì The Hawthorne Inn restaurant owner and Capone friend was killed by members of the North Side Gang. However, per the gang-conference agreement, Capone didn't retaliate. Yet, when the West Side's Joe Saltis killed gang member Ralph Sheldon, another Capone friend, Capone vented his rage on the West Side gunmen who killed his friend. Following the murders of these gunmen, Joe Saltis wisely \\"retired\\" to Wisconsin.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 37 *Apr. 4, 1927 ‚Äì Arrested after being taken into police custody for perpetrating election violence, North Side Gang leader Vincent Drucci was shot four times and killed by Chicago Police Department Detective Dan Healy, while Drucci was in police custody. According to one report, the shooting was highly controversial.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 128 *May 16, 1927 ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that profiting from \\"illicit traffic(ing) in liquor\\" would be taxable by the feds (U.S. v. Sullivan).Feds rule \\"Prohibition\\" profits taxableRusso, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 44 *Nov. 9, 1927 ‚Äì Singer and comedian Joe E. Lewis was viciously attacked and slashed on the face and neck and left for dead in his Commonwealth Hotel room by henchmen associated with Outfit lieutenant \\"Machine-Gun Jack\\" McGurn, who was at least part-owner of the Green Mill Cocktail Lounge, 4802 N. Broadway, in Uptown, where Lewis had been under contract, but decided not to renew. After the attack, Lewis initially lost his ability to speak, but regained it with therapy. Al Capone stepped up and gave Lewis $10,000 to aid his recovery. *Apr. 10, 1928 ‚Äì The extraordinary level of violence leading up to Chicago's Republican primary election led to the election being called the, \\"Pineapple Primary\\" because of the handgrenades used liberally by both sides. Adding to the chaos were \\"about 1,000\\" Capone minions breaking arms and legs of those who opposed Capone's candidate for mayor William Hale Thompson. Chicago Crime Commission founder Attorney Frank J. Loesch paid Al Capone a visit to \\"demand\\" that the gangster get his and all the other gangs to cooperate in a cease-fire leading up to the November general election. Capone made that work, and there was peace in Chicago.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 291, 292Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 38, 39 *July 1, 1928 ‚Äì New York City gangster Frankie Yale was gunned down in New York City by alleged Capone mob members, after Yale had tried to take over Chicago's Unione Siciliana by backing Capone opponent Joe Aiello, who was also backed by Chicago's North Side Gang. A second reason Yale was killed may have been that Capone found out that Yale was stealing Capone's liquor shipments and then selling them back to him.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 290‚Äì292Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 39 *July 25, 1928 ‚Äì Aiello gang member Salvatore Canale was killed outside his home in Chicago. *Sept. 7, 1928 ‚Äì Capone's former consigliere and Unione Siciliane president, Antonio Lombardo, was gunned down during a busy Chicago rush hour, where north State Street divides Madison Street between east and west, apparently by the Aiellos. Capone vowed revenge and retaliated by killing four of Aiello's brothers.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 220, 221 *1929 ‚Äì The Capone organization was bringing in $6 million a week. Capone had a personal worth of $40 million. *1929 ‚Äì Tony Accardo was allegedly made head enforcer for Capone's Chicago Outfit. *1929 ‚Äì Chicago native Eliot Ness returned to the city as a U.S. Bureau of Prohibition agent, under the U.S. Treasury Department, with his \\"Untouchables\\" to try to stop the flow of illegal booze and bring down the Capone empire.Elliot Ness comes back to town *Jan. 8, 1929 ‚Äì Unione Siciliane leader Pasquale \\"Patsy\\" Lolordo was killed in his apartment, supposedly by Joe Aiello and members of Moran's North Side Gang. *Feb. 14, 1929 ‚Äì Four unidentified men, dressed as Chicago police officers, stormed into a Near North Side garage, S-M-C Cartage Co., at 2122 N. Clark Street, and murdered members of gangster George Moran's North Side Gang and two groupies, but missed killing Moran, who was not around when the killings happened. Known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the attack effectively ended the five-year gang war between Al Capone and the North Side Gang, which had presumably started some years before, when one-time North Side Gang leader Dion O'Bannion swindled Outfit founder Johnny Torrio in a deal for a Prohibition brewery O'Banion knew would be raided. A second scenario believed to be the reason for the killings was that Capone found out that Moran's gang was hijacking Capone's booze shipments, so a phony shipment was set up to lure Moran's gang to its demise. Moran and gangster Joey Aiello went into hiding after the killings. At the time of the murders, Capone was vacationing at his Palm Island, Florida, compound. Nobody was charged with this massacre, but seemingly everyone known to be allied with a gang in the U.S., in the late 1920s, has been broached as a suspect in the Chicago gangster crime biographies written through the decades since the bloodbath. However, since the killings, it has been found through ballistics that one of the guns involved in the massacre was also involved in two other killings, that of a Michigan policeman and New York City gangster Frankie Yale. The gun was traced to Capone man Fred \\"Killer\\" Burke.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 362Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 39, 40 *Mar. 1929 ‚Äì In the wake of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Chicago Daily News publisher Frank Knox and Chicago Crime Commission director Frank J. Loesch pleaded with President Herbert Hoover for federal intervention in Chicago's gang wars. At that time, there were 63 gang-related murders a year. Besides the work of Knox and Loesch, there was group of crime-fighting Chicago businessmen known as the \\"Secret Six\\" who were working behind the scenes to bring Capone down.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 34, 45 *May 7, 1929 ‚Äì Gangster Al Capone claimed he wanted to hold a party in honor of three mobsters in his ranks who he'd found out were actually traitors behind-the-scenes to mobster-rival Joe Aiello and Aiello's desire to wrest Unione Siciliane from Capone's grip. So, Capone held a ruse dinner at a roadside inn in Hammond, Indiana, in honor of ferocious killers Albert Anselmi and John Scalise and Capone's man heading Unione Siciliana at the time, Joseph \\"Hop Toad\\" Giunta. After the party was in full-swing, Capone personally beat the three traitors with an \\"Indian club\\". Then, Capone shot all three men. Their bodies were found on a roadside near Hammond. Contrary to popular culture, Capone enforcer Tony Accardo wasn't mentioned as having played any role in either account.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 40 *May 13, 14, 15, 16, 1929 ‚Äì While the St. Valentine's Day Massacre outrage was still brewing around the nation for many gangsters, mobsters from across the nation got together in Atlantic City, New Jersey, at the Hotel President, for the Atlantic City Conference, the first of its kind, to attempt to construct a national \\"crime syndicate\\", or so-called, \\"crime corporation\\", aka \\"The Commission\\". To ensure that things went smoothly, Atlantic City political boss and racketeer Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Johnson paid off law enforcement. The purported attendees at the conference besides Johnson were future Murder, Inc., boss Albert Anastasia (Umberto Anastasia), New York City bootlegger and numbers racketeer Dutch Schultz (Arthur Flegenheimer), another head of Murder, Inc., Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchhalter, future head of the Genovese crime family Frank Costello (Francesco Castiglia), Genovese boss Lucky Luciano\\" (Salvatore Luciana), Prohibition bootlegger and Murder Inc.-associate Abner \\"Longy\\" Zwillman, bootlegger, racketeer and future \\"Mr. Las Vegas\\" Morris \\"Moe\\" Dalitz, Genovese family member Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel (Benjamin Siegelbaum), Kansas City, Missouri, political boss Tom Pendergast, who had just helped launch future President Harry S. Truman's political career seven years earlier, and Al Capone. Capone brought with him to the conference Daily Racing Form owner Moses L. \\"Moe\\" Annenberg and Capone accountant and political \\"fixer\\" Jake Guzik. Former Chicago gang mastermind Johnny Torrio was there from New York, as he had instigated \\"The Commission\\" in the first place. The conference was called for to work toward a united front among the nation's organized crime leaders while removing the \\"old\\" mafia and bringing in the \\"new\\" mafia, cooperation during Prohibition and gambling concerns. While a \\"14-point peace plan\\" was the result of the conference, \\"Capone the man\\" also became a hot topic for discussion at the conference, because the other racketeers understood that despite payoffs to local authorities, the Feds would only take so much of what was going on in Chicago gangland before they would find a way to deal with it, and that treatment of Capone by the Feds might spill over onto other organized crime-controlled cities. Jealousy concerning Capone's \\"success\\" seemed to find its way into the conference: with their eyes on the Chicago turf war, which by the time of the conference was finished for good, the other organized crime bosses demanded that Capone \\"immediately dismantle\\" his gambling empire and give it to \\"The Commission\\". However, Capone \\"adamantly refused to be forced into that humiliation\\". The crime bosses also had the audacity to install deadly Capone-opponent Joey Aiello as the Unione Siciliane's Chicago branch president, which didn't last long.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 15, 16, 21, 22Russo, Gus, The Oufit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 41‚Äì43 *1929 ‚Äì Most likely following the Atlantic City conference and for reasons not quite clear, Chicago gang boss Al Capone \\"strolled\\" through Philadelphia, and was \\"arrested\\" on a concealed weapons charge. The arrest, which was solely a PR move, landed him in prison for \\"a year\\" at the Eastern Penitentiary, in Philadelphia. However, Capone was actually free to leave the prison when he wished, according to one biographer. The \\"incarceration\\" had been set up by Philadelphia racketeer Max \\"Boo Boo\\" Hoff, with Capone's knowledge and consent. While \\"incarcerated\\" in prison, Capone had a number of comforts, including use of the warden's office phone. Capone allegedly tipped the arresting policemen $20,000.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 21, 22, 238, 239Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 43 *May 29, 1929 ‚Äì Thomas McElligot of the Westside O'Donnells was killed in a Chicago Loop saloon. =1930s= *1930s ‚Äì Rival gangs threw dynamite into the others' cabs in what became Chicago's \\"Taxi Wars\\". *1930 ‚Äì By this year, President Herbert Hoover's work on behalf of Chicago's \\"Al Capone\\" problem began to \\"get legs\\". A Washington, D.C., special prosecutor, Dwight H. Green, was dispatched to Chicago to \\"send Chicago gangsters to prison\\", specifically Al Capone. Any government ammunition Green needed to bring down Capone was at Green's disposal, as long as he could prove the need. However, Capone was not ignorant of the growing ground-swell of sentiment against him across the nation, even that his deeds had reached the Fed's ears, who he knew had started to make plans of their own against him by motivating men such as Frank J. Wilson, a U.S. Secret Service agent, and Elmer Irey, the Internal Revenue Service head. So, Capone sent some of his legal team to the nation's capitol, \\"to put in the fix\\", by spreading Capone's wealth around in the tens of thousands of dollars, at least. Yet, while the money was taken, it bought Capone no influences at all in Washington, D.C. To wit: The investigation into Chicago gangsterism also brought charges and convictions for tax evasion against Capone underlings \\"Frank Nitti\\" (Francesco Nitto), who was sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $10,000 fine, and Capone's brother \\"Ralph\\" (Raffaele Capone, Sr.), who got three years in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary and a $10,000 fine.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 45, 46 *1930 ‚Äì Months before Chicago Tribune reporter Jake Lingle's murder, Chicago Daily News news reporter Julius Rosenheim was shot to death by gangsters, after Rosenheim blackmailed bootleggers, whorehouse overseers and gamblers by threatening to write expos√®s about them. Apparently, nobody was ever charged with the murder.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 216 *Mar. 1930 ‚Äì Gangster Al Capone had had enough of his PR exile in Philadelphia, so he left the prison. *1930 (likely the end of the Spring semester) ‚Äì Soon-to-be \\"Super Lawyer\\" Sidney Korshak received his law degree from DePaul University College of Law. One of his most important functions for the Outfit was his work in eventually getting cash siphoned from the Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund to infuse organized crime's \\"promised land\\", Las Vegas, with cash. But, one to never be seen with any mobsters in public, a sanitized Korshak also \\"moved easily\\" in elite Hollywood, and in sports team circles and with captains of industry and commerce. Korshak's California office was at a Beverly Hills eatery called \\"The Bistro\\", where women and men would fawn over him, or want an audience with him. However, for Outfit business he always used the restaurant's pay phone. The \\"Super Lawyer\\" could do miracles for his legitimate clients anywhere with one phone call, even though he never tested for the California bar exam. His clients' bills went through Korshak's Chicago office.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 199, 200 *June 9, 1930 ‚Äì Chicago Tribune reporter Jake Lingle was gunned down in broad daylight, in a busy Illinois Central commuter train station underpass, at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street. At first, the deceased reporter was hailed as a hero. Over time though, people began to learn that Lingle's death had more to do with who his friends were, than what his news reporting was about. A one-time low-level member of St. Louis' Egan's Rats, Leo Vincent Brothers, found his way to Chicago and was convicted of Lingle's murder. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison, but was released from prison in 1940. It was noted by the author of this end-line reference that Brothers may not have been the one to shoot Lingle.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 215, 216 *Aug. 1, 1930 ‚Äì One-time pimp and former Outfit accountant Jack Zuta was gunned down while hiding out at an inn on Upper Nemahbin Lake, near Delafield, Wisconsin, after defecting to the North Side Gang. Some believe Zuta had even ordered the contract on Jake Lingle. *Oct. 28,One biographer notes the date as Oct. 30; Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 42 1930 ‚Äì North Side Gang bootlegger Joe Aiello was shot to death after unsuccessfully attempting to bribe a hotel cook to poison Al Capone. Trusted Capone associate Louis Campagna has been alleged to be Aiello's killer as Aiello walked out of his apartment on north Kolmar Avenue. No one was ever charged with the murder.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 4, 64, 65 *Nov. 6, 1930 ‚Äì Forty-two-Gang member at the time and soon to be Outfit rising star Sam \\"Teets\\" Battaglia and two other thugs executed a brazenly stunning armed jewelry robbery on the, then, mayor of Chicago's wife, Mary Walker \\"Maysie\\" Thompson, as she walked into her apartment. The crooks ran off with $15,000 in Thompson's jewelry and also with the gun and badge of Thompson's chauffeur-cop. Battaglia was never identified by witnesses of the crime.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 31 *1931 ‚Äì William Hale \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson was defeated for mayor of Chicago by Anton Cermak. *1931 ‚Äì Long-time freelance Chicago, \\"assembly-line\\" pimp Mike \\"de Pike\\" Heitler was found burned to death in the wreckage of his house after he defied the poor treatment he was allegedly getting, due to a Capone takeover of his whore house business, by \\"ratting\\" details concerning Chicago Mob business.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 174, 175 *1931 ‚Äì Sometime in this year, a group of mostly college graduates in the Chicago area, dubbed, \\"College Kidnappers\\", decided it was going to take the bold step of kidnapping low-level, area gangsters and holding them for ransom. Allegedly, the Klutas gang, named after leader Theodore \\"Handsome Jack\\" Klutas, took in a half-million dollars from these kidnappings in about a two- year span.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 197, 198 *Oct. 17, 1931 ‚Äì Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion following a four-day trial in Chicago. While Capone's original jury had been bribed by his underlings, the presiding federal trial judge, James Wilkerson, switched the jury at the last minute. It was also reported that Capone's defense team was ill-prepared to protect him against the stream of witnesses testifying to the gangster's \\"lavish lifestyle\\". However, Capone had \\"cut a deal\\" with the prosecutors during the pre-trial to drop 5,000 Prohibition violations that could have \\"nailed him\\" for 25,000-years-to-life if convicted on all the charges. The public talk concerning the trial, during and afterward, was that the poor showing of Capone's lawyers in his defense smacked of a set-up against Capone. Capone's close associate Paul Ricca was quoted explaining that Capone had to go away for a while, for the benefit of the organization. It has been said by the author of this end-note reference that Capone underling Gus Winkler was prevented by other Capone men from freeing him outright with $100,000 upfront tax payment (not a bribe) to the federal taxman.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 46, 47 *Oct. 24, 1931 ‚Äì One week after being convicted of tax evasion, Capone was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison (first, Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, then Alcatraz Island), fined $50,000 and charged $30,000 in court costs. While awaiting transfer to Atlanta to serve his sentence, Capone sat in Cook County Jail, where it was reported in this account that he had all the booze and women he wanted.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 47, 48 *Dec. 1931 ‚Äì Months before the nationally broadcast news about the kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's baby, in 1932, and some time before any federal kidnapping law was enacted, Outfit lieutenant Murray \\"The Hump\\" Humphreys kidnapped and held for $50,000 ransom Robert G. Fitchie, president of the Milk Wagon Driver's Union. Fitchie was released when the ransom was paid to Humphreys, who went to get the money, it was alleged.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 184, 185 *May 1932 ‚Äì Capone began serving his 11-year sentence for tax evasion, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was eventually transferred to Alcatraz Island to finish his sentence.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 48 *1933 ‚Äì Chicago \\"reform\\" Mayor Anton Cermak sent two city cops to Outfit frontman Frank Nitti's office to put a \\"hit\\" on the gangster. Apparently, the mayor wanted to take over Outfit territory and give it to the likes of Teddy Newberry, someone more to the mayor's liking. Nitti eventually recovered from his injuries.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 271, 272 *1933 (early) ‚Äì Theodore \\"Handsome Jack\\" Klutas was machine-gunned to death by cops after one of his gang turned on Klutas, ending the gang's kidnapping spree. *1933 ‚Äì Des Plaines, Illinois, gangster Roger Touhy was arrested by the FBI and eventually sentenced to 100 years in prison for kidnapping a Capone associate, con man Jake Factor. The kidnapping has been widely seen as a frame-up by the Outfit to take over Touhy's rackets. Allegedly after Touhy's conviction, Outfit mobsters flooded into Des Plaines.Sikafis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 362‚Äì364 *Feb. 15, 1933 ‚Äì Corrupt Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was riding in an open car with President- elect Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) in Miami, Florida, when Cermak was hit with sniper bullets. He died three weeks later. Speculation for years afterward was that Cermak had always been the sniper's real target, not FDR, the president- elect, in part because Cermak had put a failed \\"hit\\" of his own out on Outfit frontman, at the time, Frank Nitti. Cermak's assassin was a sharp shooter during his time in the Italian army.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 394, 395 *Dec. 5, 1933 ‚Äì Prohibition legally came to an end with the signing into law of the U.S. Constitution's 21st Amendment, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was time for organized crime across America to find a new money-making racket. *1934 ‚Äì Colorfully versed Mob \\"girlfriend\\" and Mob courier Virginia Hill came to Chicago to be a coochie dancer at the 1933‚Äì34 World's Fair. She eventually became more than \\"arm candy\\" for some of the top brass in the Outfit, before she moved on to others and eventually to Genovese Family mobster Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel. First, she met Mob tax expert and top Chicago bookie Joe Epstein, who was smitten with Hill throughout his life, even after they broke up. Then, she was seen with the Fischetti brothers, Charles, Rocco and Joseph, Murray Humphreys, Frank Nitti and Tony Accardo, who is believed to always have been faithful to his one wife.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 175, 176 *1934 ‚Äì Outfit member Tony Accardo married his fianc√© and former showgirl, Clarice Porter. Within a short time after the marriage, Accardo became a capo who oversaw Outfit gambling.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 57 *June 13, 1934 ‚Äì The Copeland Act, federal anti- racketeering legislation, was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 171 *Feb. 4, 1935 ‚Äì Thomas Maloy, president of local 110 of the Motion Picture Operators Union, was killed by multiple gun blasts from a pair of gunmen while Maloy drove down Outer Lake Shore Drive, near the former site of Chicago's 1933‚Äì34 World's Fair. FBI Agent William F. Roemer believed the gunmen were Tony Accardo and Gus Alex, with Frank \\"Strongy\\" Ferraro going along to help out.Roemer, William F., Jr., Accardo: The Ultimate Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp . 70‚Äì72 *Feb. 15, 1936 ‚Äì Once a top Outfit player, Jack McGurn was gunned down by three unknown assailants at Kafora Bowling and Billiards Parlor, 805 N. Milwaukee Avenue. Members and associates of the Outfit are the leading suspects in the murder. Nobody was ever charged.Roemer, William F., Jr., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 64, 65 *Nov. 11, 1938 ‚Äì Former First Ward alderman and \\"Levee Lord\\" John Coughlin died on this date, at age 78. *January 1939 ‚Äì Once feared and respected, Mob leader Al Capone was transferred from Alcatraz Island to the Federal Correctional Institution on Terminal Island, near Los Angeles, California, because of deteriorating health due to an advanced case of syphilus.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 388, 389 *Nov. 8, 1939 ‚Äì Chicago Attorney Edward O'Hare was shot to death by two unknown gunman who drove alongside his car while O'Hare drove down Ogden Avenue. Apparently, O'Hare double-dealt the Outfit by managing some of its affairs and also by feeding information about the Outfit to authorities for years. O'Hare's son, Edward Henry \\"Butch\\" O'Hare, who became \\"the Navy's first flying ace\\" and a Medal of Honor recipient in World War II, became the namesake for Chicago's O'Hare Airport sometime after his father's death and during the initial airport building stages in late 1943 or early 1944. The name proposal was suggested by Chicago Tribune publisher Colonel Robert R. McCormick, who had been part of the Illinois National Guard, which served a tour of duty in Europe beginning in 1917, during World War I.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 508, 509, 509n *Nov. 16, 1939 ‚Äì Steadily declining in mental capacity and in overall health, Outfit boss Al Capone was released from federal custody and sent home to Chicago.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 509 =1940s= *1940s ‚Äì The Latin Kings criminal organization was formed in Chicago. The alleged motivation for forming this group was an attempt to overcome the prejudices that Hispanics faced at the time. *Mar. 19, 1943 ‚Äì Facing extended incarceration for the extortion of Hollywood film studios and being claustrophobic, Outfit front boss Frank Nitti got drunk and publicly committed suicide on an Illinois Central railroad track, in North Riverside, Illinois, blocks from his home.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 174 *1943 ‚Äì The court in the \\"Hollywood Extortion\\" trial found eight men associated with the Outfit, Paul Ricca, Louis Campagna, Phillip D'Andrea, Frank Diamond (Maritote), Charles Gioe, Johnny Roselli and a New Jersey union boss, Louis Kaufman, guilty of conspiracy and extortion. They were all, then, sentenced to 10 years in Leavenworth Penitentiary. Though he was charged with these crimes, Frank Nitti was exempted from sentencing, because he'd committed suicide. Having steadily risen in the Outfit ranks, Tony Accardo became acting Outfit boss while Ricca was away in prison, with some claiming Murray Humphreys was co-boss with Accardo during that time. *1943 ‚Äì Paul \\"The Waiter\\" Ricca met \\"Mad Sam\\" DeStefano in Leavenworth Penitentiary and must have told him to look up the Outfit boss when DeStefano got out. *Aug. 3, 1944 ‚Äì Lawrence Mangano, a mobster who oversaw Outfit interests on the Near West Side, was gunned down at Blue Island Avenue and Taylor Street, along with his body guard, \\"Big Mike\\" Pantillo, during a night of Mangano's partying with a lady friend, after the Mangano car stopped because the partiers realized they had been followed for some distance that night. There were at least 200 shotgun pellets in Mangano's body, after being shot when he got out of the car to see what the problem was. Pantillo was shot when he tried to pull Mangano out of harm's way. The murders have never been solved. However, it's been suggested that Mangano's death made for an easier ascension and transition to power for new top Outfit boss Tony Accardo.Roemer, William F., Jr., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 82‚Äì84 *Aug. 23, 1945The death date is disputed. ‚Äì Capone-era, prolific Outfit bomber James \\"Jimmy the Bomber\\" Belcastro died of heart disease. *Sept. 1946 ‚Äì Gangster James M. Ragen died of mercury poisoning, which followed Ragen being shot at with a hail of bullets and landing in the hospital the previous month, after the Chicago Outfit gave Ragen a chance to have his race wire business bought out by the mob.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p. 304 Nobody was ever charged with the murder. *Oct. 9, 1946 ‚Äì Former First Ward alderman and \\"Levee Lord\\" Michael Kenna died from heart problems and diabetes at age 89. *Dec. 22, 1946 ‚Äì During this week, the Outfit sent a delegation of its top mobsters to the \\"Havana Conference\\", in Havana, Cuba, a historic organized crime conference for top mobsters from throughout the U.S. The decisions and policies decided at this conference applied to the American Mafia infrastructure of all of the Mafia Families for decades thereafter. Acting Outfit head Tony Accardo was there, as well as Capone cousins, the Fischetti brothers, Charles, Joseph and Rocco. However, some of the Outfit's top brass had to be excused, because they were in Leavenworth Penitentiary. The 1946 conference was the last time the American Mafia's Top \\"Boss of bosses\\" Charles Luciano could have the full-expression of his power mean something, because earlier in 1946 he'd been deported from America back to Italy, but got to the Cuba conference on a forged passport. It was during this conference it had been decided that Genovese mobster Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel would be assassinated for allegedly skimming Flamingo building funds for his own purposes and allegedly for being a terrible businessman in overseeing the casino's construction. According to this source, singer and Hoboken, New Jersey native Frank Sinatra, was allegedly the conference's entertainment.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 172, 173 *1947 ‚Äì The Outfit higher-ups who were each sentenced to 10 years in prison in the Hollywood extortion case were paroled from Leavenworth Penitentiary in 42 months, a decision granted at the time by U.S. Attorney General Tom C. Clark, under President Harry S. Truman. About two years later, Clark was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. One condition of Paul Ricca's release from prison by the court was that he was banished from ever associating with the criminal element or he was to, then, face serving the rest of his prison sentence; which, depending on what the reader believes, there were enough corrupt cops and prosecutors in Chicago to shield Ricca from even one appearance before a local judge for the rest of Ricca's life. *Jan. 25, 1947 ‚Äì One-time head of the Chicago Outfit Al Capone died at his Palm Island, Florida, compound, of an advanced case of syphilus. *June 20, 1947 ‚Äì Following the murder of Genovese Family mobster \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel, which happened on this date, his \\"girlfriend\\", Mob courier Virginia Hill, was told by Outfit taxman Joe Epstein she \\"had to\\" return any money Siegel stole from his bosses during his building of the Flamingo, in Las Vegas. She did. =1950s= *Apr. 6, 1950 ‚Äì After failing to keep his promise to use $200,000 of borrowed Mob money ‚Äì mostly from the Chicago Outfit ‚Äì to get newly elected Missouri Governor Forrest Smith to \\"open up\\" Kansas City and St. Louis to Mob interests, or to even pay the money back, Kansas City mob boss Charles Binaggio and his top enforcer Charles Gargotta were found shot to death, each man having four bullet holes in his skull showing a dice pattern, a way to murder a victim that is considered by law enforcement a Mob \\"hit\\". Binaggio and Gargotta were killed in Kansas City's First Ward Democrat offices. These killings were the springboard for the originally stalled United States Senate Kefauver Committee hearings, then just a month in the future. This was also the political ward which launched the political career of President Harry S. Truman, in 1922, whose Attorney General in the Truman administration, Tom C. Clark, set free on parole the incarcerated Outfit higher-ups who perpetrated the extortion of Hollywood celebrities and movie studio owners in the 1930s and early 1940s.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 35, 36, 135, 136, 209, 216, 217Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 252 *May 10, 1950 ‚Äì May 1951 ‚Äì Broadcast live across America even though the majority of households didn't have televisions yet, the Kefauver Committee hearings (aka, United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce) convened in allegedly mobster- controlled cities around the nation, including in Chicago, where former pimp, Outfit accountant and legal wiz Jake Guzik made an appearance. Outfit \\"West Coast\\" man Johnny Roselli testified, but said a lot of nothing. Also, to testify was Captain Dan Gilbert, chief investigator for the state attorney's office in Cook County, Illinois, after not raiding a single jurisdictional \\"bookie joint\\" in more than 10 years. He was called, \\"The World's Richest Cop\\", by reporters. Outfit heavyweight Paul Ricca and bosses Louis Campagna and Charles Gioe were called to Washington, D.C., to testify before the Committee, but all said they had made their wealth from the \\"race track\\". Al Capone's living brothers, John and Ralph, also were called before the Committee in the nation's capitol. However, many alleged mobsters in other organized crime cities came down with, \\"Kefauveritis:\\" Spontaneous ailments which wouldn't allow the alleged mobsters to testify before the Committee at any location it called them to.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 193‚Äì196Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 255, 257, 258, 260 *Sept. 19, 1950 ‚Äì Outfit Florida-man Harry \\"The Muscle\\" Russell, with the help of Murray \\"The Camel\\" Humphreys, set a federal precedent in testifying before the Kefauver Committee when Russell was the first person in American history to invoke \\"The Fifth\\" ‚Äì the right not to incriminate one's self ‚Äì while sitting before any Congressional committee.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), pp. 254‚Äì256 *Sept. 25, 1950 ‚Äì Fired former Chicago Police Detective William Drury was murdered in his garage, at the time he was investigating the life and activities of Outfit \\"Super Lawyer\\" Sidney Korshak for the Kefauver Committee hearings. Apparently, nobody was charged in the killing.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 258 *Jan. 1951 ‚Äì Secret Outfit boss Tony Accardo followed up Harry Russell's Kefauver Committee precedent by invoking \\"The Fifth\\" 140 times, in Washington, D.C. Outfit boss Joseph Aiuppa stopped saying anything to the Committee and only chewed his gum. Both Accardo and Aiuppa were cited for Contempt of Congress, but neither citation was upheld in federal court.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 261, 272 *March 15, 1951 ‚Äì Mob \\"girlfriend\\" and secret Mob courier Virginia Hill was called to testify before the Kefauver Committee for one, because the Committee knew that the Outfit had given Hill a ton of money for unknown reasons. While the verbally incindiary, verbally expletive-laden Hill didn't give up any information of value, she did put on quite a show for Committeemen and reporters alike. The Committee was aware of Hill's antics beforehand and had her sit down with it in a pre- Committee, closed-door session, as was warranted.Russo, Gus, The Outfit, Bloomsbury (2001), p. 266 *May 28, 1951 ‚Äì Outfit lieutenant Murray Humphreys, who schooled other Outfit mobsters in the art of \\"keeping quite\\" before Congress, had a contentious session with the congressmen while being asked personal questions about his life and family.

Humphreys paid $25,000 in taxes on that money. *Aug. 18, 1954 ‚Äì Having weathered federal prison for participating in the \\"Hollywood Extortion Scandal\\" in the 1940s, Outfit lieutenant Charles Gioe was murdered while driving on a Chicago street. Gioe's mobster-associate passenger, Hymie Weisman, escaped being murdered by fleeing the car. Mob underlings who worked for Outfit-connected labor leader Joey Glimco have been suspected of carrying out the assassination. But, nobody was ever charged with the murder. *1955 ‚Äì On order from soon-to-be Outfit front boss Sam Giancana, Outfit loanshark and \\"nutjob\\" Sam DeStefano killed his low-level mobster and drug-addicted brother, Michael. When DeStefano was questioned about the killing, he laughed uncontrollably.

He testified against his Outfit friends more than a decade earlier for a lighter sentence in the, \\"Hollywood Extortion Case\\", and was found at that later time, supposedly by Outfit Las Vegas, casino overseer and assassin Marshall Caifano (Marcello Giuseppi Caifano), to be working as the entertainment director at Gus Greenbaum's Riviera Hotel and Casino.

Fifty-eight high- level Mob members from various parts of the country were detained by the police. Outfit consigliere Tony Accardo and newly elevated Outfit front-boss Sam Giancana, reportedly at the conference, were not among those detained. They had gotten away unnoticed. Yet, any charges filed against any conference members were not related to the conference itself, because it was simply a meeting. Conspicuous by their absences: Meyer Lansky, Frank Costello, \\"Doc Stacher\\" (Joseph Oystacher), the New Orleans Mob representatives and Charles Luciano, who was deported at the time, didn't attend the meeting. There has been considerable speculation over the years as to why the raid took place at all. One source said the raid happened because of \\"money matters\\" between Barbara and the police. Another source pointed to recorded statements to back the idea that this meeting and subsequent raid were allowed to occur as a set- up to embarrass incoming Mob boss Vito Genovese. Another source said the raid happened because of good police work by a local cop. However, six months after the conference, Genovese was arrested on drug charges and received a 15-year sentence. He died after 10 years in prison.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 19, 20, 27, 28Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 166, 167 *Nov. 27, 1957 ‚Äì In the wake of the stunning news of organized crime's Apalachin conference, FBI Director J.

When the police checked out the call at 1:00 a.m., they found two men on the floor of a 1962 Ford sedan trying to not be noticed in the car. Ultimately, the two men told police they were waiting for someone they didn't know, in a car that wasn't either of theirs, nor did either of them know who owned the car ‚Äì someone who ultimately turned out to be non-existent. But, the men in the car turned out to be Outfit \\"hitmen\\" Felix \\"Milwaukee Phil\\" Alderisio, of Riverside, Illinois, and Charles Nicoletti, also of Riverside, The two were taken into custody and each posted $1,000 bond. However, police couldn't link the \\"hitmen\\" to any crime of the moment, or even link them to the car they were found in. So, the men were let go, even though the car, later dubbed the \\"Hitmobile\\" by reporters, had a secret compartment for guns and extra switches installed to turn off the taillights. There was also a switch to change license plates on the car. The car was impounded by the police.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 177, 178Roemer, Jr., William F., The Enforcer, Ivy Books (1994), p. 28 *May 3, 1962 ‚Äì Chicago-area Burglar Jimmy Miraglia went missing. *May 15, 1962 ‚Äì The bodies of burglars Jimmy Miraglia and Billy McCarthy were found in the trunk of a car on west 55th Street. They were badly beaten and their throats were slit. At one point earlier, they had received \\"juice loans\\" from loanshark Sam DeStefano. They had also, some time before, killed three people in a robbery attempt in a neighborhood called \\"off limits\\" by Outfit brass. DeStefano, Tony Spilotro, Charles Nicoletti, Carlo Olandese and Felix Alderisio were involved in murdering the two burglars, according to court testimony years later. It was also found out that McCarthy was tortured to find out the whereabouts of his partner, Miraglia. One of the tortures that McCarthy was subjected to was having his head put in a vice and having the vice tightened until he talked. But, one of his eyes then popped out as the vice was tightening, instead. However, McCarthy gave up Miraglia's whereabouts anyway. McCarthy was then killed. Yet, unlike the popular Mob movie, Casino, in which the vice torture was re-enacted, this source is unsure which Outfit torturer tightened the vice on burglar McCarthy. The torture deaths of these two men is known as the \\"M&M; Murders\\" in the Chicago crime annals.Roemer, Jr., William F., The Enforcer, Ivy Books (1994), p. 27‚Äì29 *1963 ‚Äì The FBI's \\"lockstep surveillance\\" of Outfit front boss Sam Giancana began.Sifakis, Carl, The Mafia Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp. 219, 220 *Nov. 22, 1963 ‚Äì President Kennedy was assassinated while being driven in a convertible, while in a presidential motorcade, in Dallas, Texas. It's been widely and hotly debated to this day whether the Chicago Outfit had anything to do with supplying the gunman/gunmen who killed President Kennedy. Yet, at the time, the Warren Commission declared that one, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone in the killing. But, Oswald, himself, was, then, assassinated in broad daylight, while surrounded by law enforcement, by lone gunman Jack Ruby (a man who had a lifestyle that raises more questions than gives answers) before Oswald could go to trial *1965 ‚Äì Outfit front boss Sam Giancana was thrown in federal prison for one year for a federal Contempt of Court citation, when he refused to testify to his or the Chicago Outfit's alleged criminal activities. *Nov. 23, 1965 ‚Äì Outfit lieutenant, legal strategist and chief \\"political fixer\\" Murray \\"The Camel\\" Humphreys suffered a fatal heart attack. A \\"laceration\\" was found on the back of the deceased Humphreys' head, below his right ear. Some believe that Humphreys could have been stuck with an empty hypodermic needle and had a shot of air sent to his heart, causing his heart attack. Just prior to the heart attack, he'd had a visit at his apartment from some FBI agents where he'd pulled a gun on them. Humphreys had to post bail for this irratic behavior. Allegedly, then, word spread that \\"The Hump\\" was \\"losing it\\". *May 20, 1966 ‚Äì While hiding out with his family at the Country Club Motel, at 8303 North Avenue, building contractor and Tony Accardo friend Sam Panveno (\\"Van Corbin\\") was shot and killed by two unknown men, after Accardo found out Panveno had been paid a visit by FBI Agent Bill Roemer. The specific motive for the killing is unclear. Apparently, Panveno built one of the Accardos' River Forest, Illinois, homes.

More than 35 years later, fellow mob associate and loanshark Frank Calabrese, Sr., was convicted during the 2007 \\"Operation Family Secrets\\" trial of killing Albergo and burying his body under what is now the U.S. Cellular Field parking lot, on west 35th Street, in the Armour Square neighborhood, on Chicago's South Side. Calbrese received life in prison for that murder and the other murders he was convicted of committing during the trial. Calabrese's brother, Nick, was also one of Albergo's assassins. But, Nick Calabrese became the prosecution's star witness against his brother, Frank, and other mobsters, who were tried on various other charges. Nick Calabrese was taken in to the Federal Witness Protection Program after the trial. *Oct. 15, 1970 ‚Äì The federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICCO) law was enacted to allow federal prosecutors to look at organized crime not just as various people committing various, unrelated crimes against the law, but instead to look at it as a group of people committed to acting illegally in order to maintain and sustain a specific, orchestrated \\"criminal enterprise\\". This law was first used against organized crime in the mid-1980s. *Sept. 25, 1971 ‚Äì One-time day- to-day boss, prolific earner and hitman Felix \\"Milwaukee Phil\\" Alderisio died in federal prison of natural causes, after being convicted of extortion.

No one has ever been charged in the murder. *Sept. 27, 1974 ‚Äì Once complicit with Chicago Outfit activity, area businessman and federal witness Daniel Siefert was gunned down at his Bensenville, Illinois, plastics factory, in front of his wife and youngest son for deciding to testify in a federal investigation as to his knowledge of an embezzled and \\"laundered\\" $1.4 million from the Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund. Joseph Lombardo, Sr., was convicted of the murder during the \\"Operation Family Secrets\\" trial and was sentenced to life in prison. During the trial, evidence was shown that Lombardo's fingerprint was on the car title of the car used in Siefert's murder.Mob fingerprint found on car tile *June 19, 1975 ‚Äì Former boss Sam Giancana was shot in the back of the head while cooking a snack of sausages and escarole in his Oak Park home on his birthday. It has been debated whether it was the Outfit or CIA that murdered Giancana. There has been speculation that alleged Outfit associate Butch Blasi, Giancana's friend and one-time driver, who visited him on the night of his death, was his killer. But, nobody was ever charged in the murder. *June 24, 1975 ‚Äì Outfit \\"West Coast\\" man Johnny Roselli testified during a special hearing of U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, in Washington, D.C. *Sept. 9, 1975 ‚Äì Valued Outfit capo and adept torturer William \\"Willie Potatoes\\" Daddano, Sr., died in federal prison, about three months after his good friend from his \\"42-Gang\\" days, Outfit front boss Sam Giancana, was assassinated. *Aug. 9, 1976 ‚Äì The decomposing body of Johnny Roselli was found floating in a 55-gallon drum, in Florida's Biscayne Bay, following a not-quite completed hit. The killers forgot to make sure the drum wouldn't surface with the body in it. His legs were sawn off and shoved in the barrel with the body. There had been speculation as to who had killed Roselli, including Santo Trafficante, Jr., the alleged Florida Mafia boss at the time who, at least, would have had to give permission for Roselli's body to be dumped in Florida. But, nobody was ever charged with Roselli's murder. *Feb. 17, 1977 ‚Äì Helen Brach, heiress to the Brach's candy fortune, disappeared after leaving the Mayo Clinic gift shop. The alleged suspects in her disappearance are her \\"houseman\\", Jack Matlick, her alleged lover Richard Bailey, horse stable owner Silas Jayne and Outfit associates Victor Spilotro and Curtis Hansen. Only Bailey was charged with, but not convicted of, her murder. Brach has never been found dead, or alive, and was declared dead in May 1984. *Mar. 29, 1977 ‚Äì Feared hitman Charles Nicoletti was killed by three .38-caliber slugs to the head, while waiting in his Oldsmobile at the Golden Horns Restaurant, in Northlake, Illinois. Supposedly, Outfit front boss Joey Aiuppa ordered the \\"hit\\", because he believed Nicoletti had become an informant, which was untrue. Outfit assassin Harry Aleman allegedly did the \\"hit\\".

It was a financial disaster, especially since Christmas was a month away. The thieves had broken in and left the store without the alarm system sounding. Levinson called police, but the police had found the thieves so good they left no trace of evidence. Then, Levinson called on his friend and top Outfit boss Tony Accardo. At the end of their meeting, Accardo let Levinson know everything would be ok. Two days later, Levinson received all of his stolen jewelry back at the store, after Accardo's men traced the compromised alarm and the stolen jewelry to the work of burglar John Mendell.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 5‚Äì7. *1978 ‚Äì Jimmy \\"the Bomber\\" Catuara was found dead near his car at Hubbard Street and Ogden Avenue.

Access to the house was gained, because the burglar alarm was compromised. There was no mention whether the Accardo's contacted the police about the break-in.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 8 *Jan. 20, 1978 ‚Äì The body of Bernie Ryan, part of John Mendell's burglary crew, was found in his 1976 Lincoln Continental, in Stone Park, Illinois.

Central Avenue, in Stickney, Illinois. Being Italian in Chicago didn't offer Moretti any insight into the Italian culture of Chicago. For his crime against Accardo, Moretti's face was torched off, he was disemboweled and his throat was slashed like all the other Accardo-home burglars.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 8,9 *Feb. 20, 1978 ‚Äì The tortured body of burglar John Mendell was found in the trunk of his 1971 Oldsmobile, at 6300 S.

He was shot multiple times and his throat was slashed. *Sept. 30, 1978 ‚Äì Apparently, because of the just previous deluge of burglary murder victims in Chicago associated with the break-in of Tony Accardo's home, a special federal grand jury ‚Äì Northern District of Illinois ‚Äì was held in Chicago to get to the bottom of the situation. Accardo was the first witness and flew through his time by taking \\"The Fifth\\". The following witness was Accardo's \\"houseman\\", Michael Volpe. His testimony took quite a bit of time, and allegedly it was \\"significant\\".Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 10 *Oct. 5, 1978 ‚Äì Accardo \\"houseman\\" Michael Volpe was reported missing by a family member. He has never been seen since. *Nov. 10, 1978 ‚Äì Because of Michael Volpe's unexplainable disappearance after testifying before a federal grand jury, which could be construed as an obstruction of justice violation, the FBI sent a team of agents to Tony Accardo's home with a search warrant. The Accardos were already wintering in Palm Springs, California, by this time. So, with permission from the Accardos' oldest daughter and the family attorney, the agents entered the home. Of the significant items seized in the raid, there was a note pad with Harry Levinson's name on it, there was a police scanner like the one burglar John Mendell used, which turned up missing from his possessions in his car, and there was $275,000 in cash wrapped in a Las Vegas bank's paper-bill wrappers, found in vault that had been built in the home. However, the cash didn't leave the premises without an intense fight with the Accardos' two daughters, with Accardo's criminal defense attorney and after telephone conferences with a couple of bail bondsmen. Ultimately, the FBI raid didn't affect Accardo at all. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit made no judgments against him and returned the $275,000 found in his vault.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), pp. 10‚Äì14 *May 22, 1979 ‚Äì John Borsellino's bullet-riddled body was found in a farmer's field at the Cook‚ÄìWill County line. Then, the body of Gerry Carusiello was found with bullet holes in his back, in an apartment complex, in Addison, Illinois. He was Outfit front boss Joey Aiuppa's driver at the time. Both deceased men were also allegedly Outfit \\"hitmen\\" who'd killed six of the seven home burglars in John Mendell's partners, though Borsellino and Carusiello did not kill Mendell. After these two Outfit murders, there was no reported FBI raid on Tony Accardo, nor on anyone else allegedly connected with the Outfit.Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather, Ivy Books (1995), p. 13 =1980s= *1980s ‚Äì Operation Greylord was a federal-level investigation, followed by various corruption trials, targeting the Cook County, Illinois, judiciary (the Chicago jurisdiction). *1980s ‚Äì \\"Marquette Ten\\": 10 police officers in Chicago's Marquette District were convicted of taking bribes from drug dealers. Among those was Chicago police officer Thomas Ambrose, the father of former U.S. Marshal John Ambrose, who was convicted 20-years later of leaking information to the Chicago Outfit about federal informant Nick Calabrese, who testified against top Chicago mobsters in the \\"Family Secrets\\" trial. *July 2, 1980 ‚Äì Alleged Outfit \\"hitman\\" and muscle man William Dauber and his wife, Charlotte, were chased in their car and shotgunned to death after leaving the Will County, Illinois, courthouse, allegedly by four Outfit tough guys, Gerald Scarpelli, William Petrocelli, Frank Calabrese, Sr., and depending on the source, Joseph \\"Jerry\\" Scalise, or Ronald Jarrett.Couple assassinated in rural Will County Calabrese's brother, Nick, corroborated that Frank had participated in the Daubers' killings during the 2007 \\"Operation Family Secrets\\" trial. *Sept. 11, 1980 ‚Äì Outfit burglars Joseph Scalise and Arthur Rachel stole the Marlborough Diamond (a value of $960,000 in 1994) and $3.6 million worth of jewelry from a jewelry store in London, England, in broad daylight.

The fourth wound he'd received to the back of his head while running from his car to the banquet hall killed him. Apparently, the \\"hit\\" was put out because Fecarotta botched the Spilotro brothers' burial assignment. The bodies were not supposed to be found. Outfit \\"hitman\\" Nick Calabrese admitted killing Fecarotta in federal court during the \\"Operation Family Secrets\\" trial. Because of DNA evidence, Calabrese also had to admit during the trial that he was wearing the bloody glove that was dropped at the murder scene, while chasing Fecarotta, and was found by investigators and federal law enforcement, who ultimately put together the \\"Family Secrets\\" trial.Botched burial ends in murder *1988 ‚Äì Outfit-associated bookmaker James Basile agreed to become a government informant, later identifying a \\"Mafia graveyard\\" at Route 83 and Bluff Road, near Darien, Illinois.

Merchants joined the boycott against buying British products. When the London government harshly punished Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party, South Carolina's leaders joined 11 other colonies (except Georgia) in forming the Continental Congress. When the British attacked Lexington and Concord in the spring of 1775 and were beaten back by the Massachusetts Patriots, South Carolina rallied to support the American Revolution. Loyalists and Patriots of the colony were split by nearly 50/50. Many of the South Carolinian battles fought during the American Revolution were with loyalist Carolinians and the part of the Cherokee tribe that allied with the British. This was to General Henry Clinton's advantage. His strategy was to march his troops north from St. Augustine, Florida, and sandwich George Washington in the North. Clinton alienated Loyalists and enraged Patriots by attacking a fleeing army of Patriot soldiers who posed no threat. Enslaved Africans and African Americans chose independence by escaping to British lines where they were promised freedom.Ramsay's History of South Carolina two volumes later published in one volume. Newberry, S.C., W. J. Duffie, 1858. p. 272 states that 25,000 slaves escaped joining the British Army during the Revolutionary War. Colonel Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee placed the number of slaves who went to the British side at more than 20,000 in his Memoirs of the Revolutionary War in the Southern Department, Volume II, p. 456. These numbers have been estimated to be between 20 and 25 percent of the slave population of the state at the time. William Jay in Miscellaneous writings on slavery, Volume 3, 1853, p. 460 gives the slave population of South Carolina in 1790 as 107,00 to show the magnitude of the number of slaves who fled to the British side in the Revolutionary War. Digital History Explorations Revolutionary War places the percentage of escaped slaves in South Carolina during the Revolutionary War at about 25 per cent. Combined Continental Army and state militia forces under the command of Major General Nathanael Greene regained control of much of South Carolina by capturing the numerous interdependent chain of British held forts throughout the State. One-by-one, the British and Loyalists were surrounded in Charles Town and became completely dependent on supplies by sea. After preliminary peace terms had been agreed, the British evacuated Charles Town on December 14, 1782, a day now officially designated as \\"South Carolina Independence Day\\". Greene was awarded a Congressional Medal and numerous other official awards from the State of South Carolina for his leadership in liberating the state and for restoring an elected government. In 1787, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Pierce Butler went to Philadelphia where the Constitutional Convention was being held and constructed what served as a detailed outline for the U.S. Constitution. Pre-war causes After Parliament began taxing the North American colonies to raise revenue to make up for the costs of the French and Indian War and Pontiac's Rebellion, to protest the Stamp Act, South Carolina sent wealthy rice planter Thomas Lynch, 26-year-old lawyer John Rutledge, and Christopher Gadsden to the Stamp Act Congress. Gadsden, leader of the pro-Independence \\"Liberty Boys,\\" is often grouped with James Otis and Patrick Henry as the prime agitators for American independence by historians. Gadsden designed the \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" flag, first used on December 3, 1775, on the Alfred, featuring a rattlesnake with 13 rattles representing each colony. In 1767, the Townsend Acts levied new taxes on glass, oil, wine, tea, paper, and other goods. Gadsden led the opposition and although Britain removed the taxes on everything except tea, Charlestonians mirrored the Boston Tea Party by dumping a shipment of tea into the Cooper River. Other shipments were allowed to land, but they rotted in Charles Town storehouses. Delegates from twelve colonies, all of the Thirteen Colonies except for Georgia, came together for the First Continental Congress in 1774. Five South Carolinians, including those who represented the colony in the Stamp Act Congress, headed for Philadelphia. Henry Middleton served as president for part of Congress. The following January the South Carolina colonial assembly was disbanded by Royal Governor Lord William Campbell, and it was reformed as an extralegal Provincial Congress. During this meeting and following meetings, in June 1775 and March 1776, the South Carolinians created a temporary government to rule until the colony had settled things with Britain. John Rutledge was voted \\"president\\" of the state which was called the \\"General Assembly of South Carolina\\" (the term \\"Republic\\" or \\"Republic of South Carolina\\" was never used.) Most Loyalists came from the Upcountry, which thought that domination by the rich, elitist Charles Town planter class in an unsupervised government was worse than remaining under the rule of the British Crown. Judge William Henry Drayton and Reverend William Tennent were sent to the Back Country to gain support for the \\"American Cause\\" and Lowcountry's General Committee and Provincial Congress but did not have much success. In September 1775, the Royal Governor dissolved the last-ever Royal Assembly in South Carolina and left for the safety of the British warship Tamar in the Charleston Harbor. Early conflicts British General Henry Clinton Throughout the course of the American Revolutionary War, over 200 battles were fought within South Carolina, more than in any other state. On November 19, 1775, Patriot forces of the Long Cane Militia fought Loyalists in the first battle of Ninety Six, resulting in the death of James Birmingham, the first South Carolinian and southerner of the war. Colonel Richard Richardson led a large party of Whigs into the Upcountry to arrest Loyalists and to assert the power of the revolutionary General Committee over the entire colony. Britain's strategy was to take advantage of strong Loyalist support in the South, begin a military drive in Charles Town, and perhaps sweep through the Upcountry, North Carolina, and Virginia while gathering men to take on Washington in the North. Under Colonel William Moultrie, the South Carolinians defeated the Royal Navy in the Battle of Sullivan's Island on June 28, 1776, and brought the Patriot Continental Army a major victory. In Philadelphia, the news reached delegates of the Second Continental Congress on July 19, over two weeks after delegates had voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence. The Battle of Sullivan's Island also caused the British to rethink their strategy and leave the South for approximately three years. The new state legislature met the next December to complete the state constitution made the previous October, de-establishing the Anglican Church. In the Upcountry, the British had convinced the Cherokee to fight on their side. Although the British officer in charge of the operation had told the Cherokee to attack only Patriot soldiers in organized groups, soon murder and cabin burnings were widespread on the frontier. The Whigs' Andrew Williamson, Andrew Pickens, and James Williams, who had been battling Loyalists in the Upcountry, launched a successful campaign against the Cherokee. In 1777 they ceded their remaining lands to the South Carolina government. On February 5, 1778, South Carolina became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States. In 1780, the British returned to South Carolina. Siege of Charleston In 1780, the British, stalemated in the north and facing pressure from home to end the war, embarked on a plan of action that would come to be known to historians as \\"The Southern Strategy.\\" They planned to trap George Washington's troops by pushing their troops up from the South while Washington defended himself in the North. The British landed a major expeditionary force south of Charleston, landing on John's Island, moving to James Island, and then besieging Charles Town. General Benjamin Lincoln defended the city during a two-month siege but was forced to surrender almost all the Continental forces in the Carolinas to General Clinton. Henry Middleton, once president of the Continental Congress, was forced to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown as a prisoner. General Washington begged Governor John Rutledge and the rest of the state's council to leave Charles Town while there was still time, and they did. Rutledge traveled around the state, printing proclamations and other state papers on a printing press he had with him, and sending numerous letters demanding that the Continental Congress send the Continental Army to relieve South Carolina. \\"Lieutenant-Colonel Banastre Tarleton\\" by Sir Joshua Reynolds The British quickly established control over the coast, making posts at the other port cities of Beaufort and Georgetown. It was during this time that many enslaved African Americans managed to escape to their lines. The African Americans wanted freedom, and the British promised them that. Approximately 25,000 African Americans, one-quarter of the enslaved population, escaped to the British during the war to achieve freedom.Digital History The British followed their coastal occupation by establishing posts upcountry where they could establish control by coordinating with local Tories. Responding to Rutledge's pleas and the British threat to the whole southern flank, Washington sent an army of Continentals under General Gates, but was defeated at Camden on August 16, 1780, and the remnant of the army retreated northward in record time. Just before the battle of Camden, Gates met with Francis Marion, a militia officer who had escaped parole at the defeat of Charleston because of an accidental injury, which caused him to be out of town at the surrender. Marion had a small group of rag-tag militia men with him, whose appearance evoked derision from the Continentals. Gates saw Marion as an embarrassment and got rid of him by giving him orders to scout the British and destroy boats, bridges, and other items that might be useful to the British. Marion left, obeying his orders, and missed the battle. The following day, by order of Governor Rutledge, and by invitation of the troops, he accepted command of the Williamsburg militia at the confluence of Lynches River and the Pee Dee River. This band joined together with a few other militiamen from around the state became known as Marion's Brigade (Marion was eventually commissioned general). Marion had not yet heard the news of Gates' defeat at the time. The next day a small militia under Thomas Sumter was surprised and completely routed at Fishing Creek; Sumter barely escaped with his life. At this point, Marion had the only viable Patriot army left in the South. From that time until the arrival of General Nathanael Greene, the war's outcome in the south depended entirely on the militia, and the militia gradually turned the tide. The war was not only a clash of arms but a battle for the sympathy of the population. After leaving Gates, Marion began a new and unheard of policy, as he destroyed boats the British might use, and commandeered food, horses and other property from the settlers. He had his troops issue receipts for each item to the owners. His gentlemanly actions quickly made Marion a hero and garnered support for his brigade. Many of these receipts were redeemed after the war, with the new state government usually paying in full. General Clinton's Mistakes General Clinton thought that South Carolina was a Loyalist colony that had been bullied into revolutionary actions by a small minority. His idea was to increase British presence in the entire state and bring back the confidence of moderates in the area so that they would fight for the British. Clinton alienated Loyalists by spending all of the money on extra arms and soldiers rather than doctors. American Colonel Abraham Buford and his body of Virginia patriots had set south in hopes of defending Charles Town but turned back when they realized they were too late. British Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton was unwilling to let the rebels escape back to the North and chased after them, another act that alienated more loyalists. Tarleton caught up with them on May 29, 1780, near the present town of Lancaster, South Carolina, and Americans were told to surrender, but refused. They still marched forward with full knowledge that Tarleton was fast approaching. In the Battle of Waxhaws the Americans were routed by Tarleton and his men, who suffered minimal casualties. Due to confusion in the battle, quarter was refused, and a number of Americans who had surrendered were killed. This spawned the battle cry that Southern patriots would use for the rest of the war, \\"Tarleton's quarter!\\". The second British blunder was Clinton revoking the Carolinians' paroles. He broke his promise that if the Carolinians who surrendered did not actively seek to harass the British government, he would leave them and their paroles alone. On June 3, he proclaimed that all prisoners of war could either take up arms against their fellow Americans or be considered traitors to the Crown. Many soldiers, whose pride had already been bruised, reasoned that if they were going to have to take the chance of getting shot again, they might as well fight on the side they wanted to win. The third British mistake was burning the Stateburg, South Carolina, home and harassing the incapacitated wife of a then inconsequential colonel named Thomas Sumter. Because of his fury over this, Sumter became one of the fiercest and most devastating guerrilla leaders of the war, becoming known as \\"The Gamecock\\". The Lowcountry partisans fighting under Marion and Upcountry partisans fighting under Andrew Pickens (whose home had also been burned) plagued the British by using guerilla warfare in the mountains, woods, and swamps of the state. Tides turn for the Americans On October 8, 1780, at Kings Mountain, American Colonel Isaac Shelby led a body of North and South Carolinians and attacked British Major Patrick Ferguson and his body of American loyalists on a hilltop. America's first major poet, William Cullen Bryant, described the home field advantage that led to the Patriot victory in one of his poems. This was a major victory for the Patriots, especially because it was won by militiamen and not trained Continentals. It provided a great swing of momentum for the moderate \\"Overmountain Men\\" who had grown tired of British brutality. Kings Mountain is considered to be the turning point of the revolution in the South, because it squashed any significant further recruitment of Loyalists, and compelled Cornwallis to temporarily abandon North Carolina. That December, General Nathanael Greene arrived with an army of Continental troops. When Greene heard of Tarleton's approach, he sent Brigadier General Daniel Morgan and his backwoodsmen over the Appalachian Mountains to stop him. On January 17, 1781, the two forces met at a grassy field with widespread hardwoods, reeds, and marsh in a well-known cattle grazing area called Cowpens. Pickens and his guerilla soldiers joined Morgan directly before the battle. Morgan still felt they were not strong enough to take on Tarleton's trained troops and wanted to cross a river that would separate them from the British and secure them a chance to retreat. Pickens convinced Morgan that staying on the British side of the river would force his men to fight it out in what some historians consider the best-planned battle of the entire war. The Patriots defeated the British and later battles at Hobkirk's Hill and Eutaw Springs would further weaken the British. Fighting continued throughout 1781 in the backcountry, where patriot and loyalist militias alike looted homes and killed civilians. One of the most infamous is William \\"Bloody Bill\\" Cunningham's \\"Bloody Scout,\\" who terrorized homes and massacred dozens of Whigs. In December 1782, the British evacuated Charles Town. The overjoyed residents changed the name to \\"Charleston\\" because it sounded \\"less British.\\" Loyalists South Carolina had one of the strongest Loyalists factions of any state. About 5000 men took up arms against the Patriot government during the revolution, and thousands more were supporters who avoided taxes, sold supplies to the British, and who had avoided conscription. Nearly all had emigrated to the province after 1765, as only about one in six was native-born. About 45% of the Loyalists were small farmers, 30% were merchants, artisans or shopkeepers; 15% were large farmers or plantation owners, and 10% were royal officials. Geographically, they were strongest in the back-country, where most settlers before the revolution had opposed the coastal aristocracySouth Carolina Encyclopedia; Walter Edgar, ed. (2006) pp 571-73Robert Stansbury Lambert, South Carolina Loyalists in the American Revolution, 2nd ed.; Clemson University Digital Press, (2011); free online access; retrieved May 2018 South Carolina had endured bitter internal strife between Patriots and Loyalists during the war (esp. 1780-82). Nevertheless, it adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained behind. The state government successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. During the war, pardons were offered to Loyalists who switched sides and joined the Patriot forces. Others were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of their property. The legislature named 232 Loyalists liable for the confiscation of their property, but most appealed and were forgiven.Rebecca Brannon, From Revolution to Reunion: The Reintegration of the South Carolina Loyalists, University of South Carolina Press, (2016) The Constitution In 1787, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Pierce Butler went to Philadelphia where the Constitutional Convention was piecing together the Constitution. At thirty years old, Charles Pinckney had long been a critic of the weak Articles of Confederation. Although he was wealthy by birth and quite the epicurean, Pinckney became the leader of democracy in the state. On May 29, 1787, he presented the Convention with a detailed outline of the United States Constitution, and John Rutledge provided valuable input. Pierce Butler, a major slaveholder who lost numerous slaves during the war who escaped to the British, included a constitutional clause for the return of fugitive slaves. The federal, and Federalist-leaning, Constitution was ratified by the state in May 1788. The new state constitution was ratified in 1790 without the support of the Upcountry. The Lowcountry elite, who had only a quarter of the state's white inhabitants, still ruled the state as they controlled three-quarters of South Carolina's wealth, much of it in enslaved African Americans. During the 1780s, Charleston physician David Ramsay published two of the first histories of the American Revolution: The History of the Revolution of South-Carolina (1785) and The History of the American Revolution (1789).

Owing to the relevance of thermodynamics in much of science and technology, its history is finely woven with the developments of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, magnetism, and chemical kinetics, to more distant applied fields such as meteorology, information theory, and biology (physiology), and to technological developments such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine, cryogenics and electricity generation. The development of thermodynamics both drove and was driven by atomic theory. It also, albeit in a subtle manner, motivated new directions in probability and statistics; see, for example, the timeline of thermodynamics. History=Contributions from antiquity= The ancients viewed heat as that related to fire. In 3000 BC, the ancient Egyptians viewed heat as related to origin mythologies. The ancient Indian philosophy including vedic philosophy believe that five basic elements are the basis of all cosmic creations. In the Western philosophical tradition, after much debate about the primal element among earlier pre-Socratic philosophers, Empedocles proposed a four-element theory, in which all substances derive from earth, water, air, and fire. The Empedoclean element of fire is perhaps the principal ancestor of later concepts such as phlogin and caloric. Around 500 BC, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus became famous as the \\"flux and fire\\" philosopher for his proverbial utterance: \\"All things are flowing.\\" Heraclitus argued that the three principal elements in nature were fire, earth, and water. Heating a body, such as a segment of protein alpha helix (above), tends to cause its atoms to vibrate more, and to expand or change phase, if heating is continued; an axiom of nature noted by Herman Boerhaave in the 1700s. In the early modern period, heat was thought to be a measurement of an invisible fluid, known as the caloric. Bodies were capable of holding a certain amount of this fluid, leading to the term heat capacity, named and first investigated by Scottish chemist Joseph Black in the 1750s. In the 18th and 19th centuries, scientists abandoned the idea of a physical caloric, and instead understood heat as a manifestation of a system's internal energy. Today heat is the transfer of disordered thermal energy. Nevertheless, at least in English, the term heat capacity survives. In some other languages, the term thermal capacity is preferred, and it is also sometimes used in English. Atomism is a central part of today's relationship between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Ancient thinkers such as Leucippus and Democritus, and later the Epicureans, by advancing atomism, laid the foundations for the later atomic theory. Until experimental proof of atoms was later provided in the 20th century, the atomic theory was driven largely by philosophical considerations and scientific intuition. The 5th century BC Greek philosopher Parmenides, in his only known work, a poem conventionally titled On Nature, uses verbal reasoning to postulate that a void, essentially what is now known as a vacuum, in nature could not occur. This view was supported by the arguments of Aristotle, but was criticized by Leucippus and Hero of Alexandria. From antiquity to the Middle Ages various arguments were put forward to prove or disapprove the existence of a vacuum and several attempts were made to construct a vacuum but all proved unsuccessful. The European scientists Cornelius Drebbel, Robert Fludd, Galileo Galilei and Santorio Santorio in the 16th and 17th centuries were able to gauge the relative \\"coldness\\" or \\"hotness\\" of air, using a rudimentary air thermometer (or thermoscope). This may have been influenced by an earlier device which could expand and contract the air constructed by Philo of Byzantium and Hero of Alexandria. Around 1600, the English philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon surmised: \\"Heat itself, its essence and quiddity is motion and nothing else.\\" In 1643, Galileo Galilei, while generally accepting the 'sucking' explanation of horror vacui proposed by Aristotle, believed that nature's vacuum-abhorrence is limited. Pumps operating in mines had already proven that nature would only fill a vacuum with water up to a height of ~30 feet. Knowing this curious fact, Galileo encouraged his former pupil Evangelista Torricelli to investigate these supposed limitations. Torricelli did not believe that vacuum-abhorrence (Horror vacui) in the sense of Aristotle's 'sucking' perspective, was responsible for raising the water. Rather, he reasoned, it was the result of the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding air. To prove this theory, he filled a long glass tube (sealed at one end) with mercury and upended it into a dish also containing mercury. Only a portion of the tube emptied (as shown adjacent); ~30 inches of the liquid remained. As the mercury emptied, and a partial vacuum was created at the top of the tube. The gravitational force on the heavy element Mercury prevented it from filling the vacuum. = Transition from chemistry to thermochemistry = The world's first ice-calorimeter, used in the winter of 1782‚Äì83, by Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace, to determine the heat evolved in various chemical changes; calculations which were based on Joseph Black's prior discovery of latent heat. These experiments mark the foundation of thermochemistry. The theory of phlogiston arose in the 17th century, late in the period of alchemy. Its replacement by caloric theory in the 18th century is one of the historical markers of the transition from alchemy to chemistry. Phlogiston was a hypothetical substance that was presumed to be liberated from combustible substances during burning, and from metals during the process of rusting. Caloric, like phlogiston, was also presumed to be the \\"substance\\" of heat that would flow from a hotter body to a cooler body, thus warming it. The first substantial experimental challenges to caloric theory arose in Rumford's 1798 work, when he showed that boring cast iron cannons produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to friction, and his work was among the first to undermine the caloric theory. The development of the steam engine also focused attention on calorimetry and the amount of heat produced from different types of coal. The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by Lavoisier using an ice calorimeter following research by Joseph Black on the latent heat of water. More quantitative studies by James Prescott Joule in 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, and helped to place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. William Thomson, for example, was still trying to explain Joule's observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of kinetic theory, however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete by the end of the 19th century. Joseph Black and Lavoisier made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the calorimeter, a subject which became known as thermochemistry. = Phenomenological thermodynamics = Robert Boyle. 1627‚Äì1691 *Boyle's law (1662) *Charles's law was first published by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1802, but he referenced unpublished work by Jacques Charles from around 1787. The relationship had been anticipated by the work of Guillaume Amontons in 1702. *Gay-Lussac's law (1802) =Birth of thermodynamics as a science= Irish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle in 1656, in coordination with English scientist Robert Hooke, built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation: P.V=constant. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later. Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring.New Experiments physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects (1660). Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave Gay-Lussac the opportunity to derive his law, which led shortly later to the ideal gas law. But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named Denis Papin built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated. Later designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine. He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer Thomas Savery built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. One such scientist was Sadi Carnot, the \\"father of thermodynamics\\", who in 1824 published Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, a discourse on heat, power, and engine efficiency. This marks the start of thermodynamics as a modern science. A Watt steam engine, the steam engine that propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the world Hence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the Savery Engine, horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the Newcomen Engine, and later the Watt Engine. In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses. Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \\"horse power\\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input fuel into useful work. In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output. Hence the need for a new science of engine dynamics was born. Sadi Carnot (1796‚Äì1832): the \\"father\\" of thermodynamics Most cite Sadi Carnot's 1824 book Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire as the starting point for thermodynamics as a modern science. Carnot defined \\"motive power\\" to be the expression of the useful effect that a motor is capable of producing. Herein, Carnot introduced us to the first modern day definition of \\"work\\": weight lifted through a height. The desire to understand, via formulation, this useful effect in relation to \\"work\\" is at the core of all modern day thermodynamics. In 1843, James Joule experimentally found the mechanical equivalent of heat. In 1845, Joule reported his best- known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel in a barrel of water, which allowed him to estimate a mechanical equivalent of heat of 819 ft¬∑lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of conservation of energy and explained why heat can do work. In 1850, the famed mathematical physicist Rudolf Clausius coined the term \\"entropy\\" (das W√§rmegewicht, symbolized S) to denote heat lost or turned into waste. (\\"W√§rmegewicht\\" translates literally as \\"heat-weight\\"; the corresponding English term stems from the Greek œÑœÅŒ≠œÄœâ, \\"I turn\\".) The name \\"thermodynamics\\", however, did not arrive until 1854, when the British mathematician and physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) coined the term thermo-dynamics in his paper On the Dynamical Theory of Heat. reprinted in Hence Thermo-dynamics falls naturally into two Divisions, of which the subjects are respectively, the relation of heat to the forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency. In association with Clausius, in 1871, the Scottish mathematician and physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated a new branch of thermodynamics called Statistical Thermodynamics, which functions to analyze large numbers of particles at equilibrium, i.e., systems where no changes are occurring, such that only their average properties as temperature T, pressure P, and volume V become important. Soon thereafter, in 1875, the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann formulated a precise connection between entropy S and molecular motion: :S=k\\\\log W \\\\, being defined in terms of the number of possible states [W] such motion could occupy, where k is the Boltzmann's constant. The following year, 1876, chemical engineer Willard Gibbs published an obscure 300-page paper titled: On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances, wherein he formulated one grand equality, the Gibbs free energy equation, which suggested a measure of the amount of \\"useful work\\" attainable in reacting systems. Gibbs also originated the concept we now know as enthalpy H, calling it \\"a heat function for constant pressure\\". The modern word enthalpy would be coined many years later by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who based it on the Greek word enthalpein meaning to warm. Building on these foundations, those as Lars Onsager, Erwin Schr√∂dinger, and Ilya Prigogine, and others, functioned to bring these engine \\"concepts\\" into the thoroughfare of almost every modern-day branch of science. = Kinetic theory = The idea that heat is a form of motion is perhaps an ancient one and is certainly discussed by Francis Bacon in 1620 in his Novum Organum. The first written scientific reflection on the microscopic nature of heat is probably to be found in a work by Mikhail Lomonosov, in which he wrote: :\\"(..) movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen. Who would deny that the leaves of trees move when rustled by a wind, despite it being unobservable from large distances? Just as in this case motion remains hidden due to perspective, it remains hidden in warm bodies due to the extremely small sizes of the moving particles. In both cases, the viewing angle is so small that neither the object nor their movement can be seen.\\" During the same years, Daniel Bernoulli published his book Hydrodynamics (1738), in which he derived an equation for the pressure of a gas considering the collisions of its atoms with the walls of a container. He proves that this pressure is two thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas in a unit volume. Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture. Bernoulli made a connection with Gottfried Leibniz's vis viva principle, an early formulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the two theories became intimately entwined throughout their history. Though Benjamin Thompson suggested that heat was a form of motion as a result of his experiments in 1798, no attempt was made to reconcile theoretical and experimental approaches, and it is unlikely that he was thinking of the vis viva principle. John Herapath later independently formulated a kinetic theory in 1820, but mistakenly associated temperature with momentum rather than vis viva or kinetic energy. His work ultimately failed peer review and was neglected. John James Waterston in 1843 provided a largely accurate account, again independently, but his work received the same reception, failing peer review even from someone as well-disposed to the kinetic principle as Davy. Further progress in kinetic theory started only in the middle of the 19th century, with the works of Rudolf Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell, and Ludwig Boltzmann. In his 1857 work On the nature of the motion called heat, Clausius for the first time clearly states that heat is the average kinetic energy of molecules. This interested Maxwell, who in 1859 derived the momentum distribution later named after him. Boltzmann subsequently generalized his distribution for the case of gases in external fields. Boltzmann is perhaps the most significant contributor to kinetic theory, as he introduced many of the fundamental concepts in the theory. Besides the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution mentioned above, he also associated the kinetic energy of particles with their degrees of freedom. The Boltzmann equation for the distribution function of a gas in non-equilibrium states is still the most effective equation for studying transport phenomena in gases and metals. By introducing the concept of thermodynamic probability as the number of microstates corresponding to the current macrostate, he showed that its logarithm is proportional to entropy.

In March 1851, while grappling to come to terms with the work of James Prescott Joule, Lord Kelvin started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of useful heat in all processes. The idea was framed even more dramatically by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the heat death of the universe. In 1854, William John Macquorn Rankine started to make use in calculation of what he called his thermodynamic function. This has subsequently been shown to be identical to the concept of entropy formulated by Rudolf Clausius in 1865. Clausius used the concept to develop his classic statement of the second law of thermodynamics the same year.  Heat transfer  The phenomenon of heat conduction is immediately grasped in everyday life. In 1701, Sir Isaac Newton published his law of cooling. However, in the 17th century, it came to be believed that all materials had an identical conductivity and that differences in sensation arose from their different heat capacities. Suggestions that this might not be the case came from the new science of electricity in which it was easily apparent that some materials were good electrical conductors while others were effective insulators. Jan Ingen-Housz in 1785-9 made some of the earliest measurements, as did Benjamin Thompson during the same period. The fact that warm air rises and the importance of the phenomenon to meteorology was first realised by Edmund Halley in 1686. Sir John Leslie observed that the cooling effect of a stream of air increased with its speed, in 1804. Carl Wilhelm Scheele distinguished heat transfer by thermal radiation (radiant heat) from that by convection and conduction in 1777. In 1791, Pierre Pr√©vost showed that all bodies radiate heat, no matter how hot or cold they are. In 1804, Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of black-body radiation. Though it had become to be suspected even from Scheele's work, in 1831 Macedonio Melloni demonstrated that black-body radiation could be reflected, refracted and polarised in the same way as light. James Clerk Maxwell's 1862 insight that both light and radiant heat were forms of electromagnetic wave led to the start of the quantitative analysis of thermal radiation. In 1879, Jo≈æef Stefan observed that the total radiant flux from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature and stated the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law. The law was derived theoretically by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1884.  Absolute Zero  In 1702 Guillaume Amontons introduced the concept of absolute zero based on observations of gases. In 1810, Sir John Leslie froze water to ice artificially. The idea of absolute zero was generalised in 1848 by Lord Kelvin. In 1906, Walther Nernst stated the third law of thermodynamics.  Quantum Thermodynamics  In 1900 Max Planck found an accurate formula for the spectrum of black-body radiation. Fitting new data required the introduction of a new constant, known as Planck's constant, the fundamental constant of modern physics. Looking at the radiation as coming from a cavity oscillator in thermal equilibrium, the formula suggested that energy in a cavity occurs only in multiples of frequency times the constant. That is, it is quantized. This avoided a divergence to which the theory would lead without the quantization.

He was also Secretary of State for Air between 1921 and 1922. He won the Bronze medal with the British polo team in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Early life Frederick Edward Guest was born in London, the third son of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne (1835‚Äì1914) and Lady Cornelia Spencer-Churchill (1847‚Äì1927). The Guest family had made its fortune in the iron and steel industry in the 18th and 19th centuries and had married into the aristocracy. The Wimbornes were Conservatives who had been friends of Benjamin Disraeli. His mother was the eldest daughter of the John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough. Guest's four brothers were also politically active, with Ivor Guest serving as 2nd Baron, 1st Viscount Wimborne, a junior minister, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In addition, Henry Guest and Oscar Guest were Members of Parliament (MPs), while Lionel Guest (1880‚Äì1935) was a member of the London County Council. His sister Frances Charlotte Guest (1865‚Äì1957) was married to Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, who served as Viceroy of India. Guest was a first cousin of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, and Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe as well as a nephew of Conservative politician Lord Randolph Churchill, George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough, and Lady Anne Emily Spencer Churchill who was married to the 7th Duke of Roxburghe. His cousin, the 8th Duke of Roxburghe, was married to American heiress Mary Goelet, the only daughter of Ogden Goelet.

He was commissioned as second-lieutenant in the Infantry militia, East Surrey Regiment, and promoted to lieutenant on 7 April 1894. After apprenticeship in the militia, Guest was on 15 May 1897 appointed an officer in the 1st Life Guards, and promoted to lieutenant in that regiment on 23 November 1898. He was sent to Egypt in 1899, and in late November that year was part of a Camel Corps during the operations leading to the defeat of the Khalifa (mentioned in despatches 25 November 1899). He served in South Africa during the Second Boer War from 1901, returning home in late June 1902, following the end of hostilities. Back in the United Kingdom, he returned to a regular posting with his regiment in September 1902. He was decorated for bravery, and rose to captain before retiring from active duty in 1906. =Political career= In 1904, during the controversy within the Conservative Party over adopting protectionism, Guest and other members of his family followed his cousin and close friend, Winston Churchill, into the Liberal Party in support of free trade ‚Äî and perhaps also to accelerate their political careers. In 1906 Guest became private secretary to Churchill, by then a junior minister in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberal government. Guest attempted three times to enter the House of Commons before winning the vote in the East Dorset seat in the January 1910 general election. Although he remained unseated because of election irregularities by his constituency agent, he was reelected in December 1910. Known in the political world as \\"Freddie Guest,\\" he was a popular backbencher, became a Liberal Party whip in 1911, in the same year was elected a charter member of the cross-bench Other Club of political insiders, and was appointed Treasurer of the Household (Deputy Chief Whip) in 1912. When the First World War began in August 1914, Guest returned to active service as aide-de-camp to Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force in France. Guest performed confidential missions for French, liaising with the War Office and with political leaders. In 1916 Guest served in the East African theatre of war and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. After being invalided out of the army following serious illness, Guest resumed his political career. In May 1917 he joined Lloyd George's Coalition government as joint Patronage Secretary of the Treasury ‚Äì effectively chief whip for the Coalition Liberals. On 3 December 1917 Guest sent Lloyd George a 14-page memo stating that although only around a third of Liberal MPs were staunch supporters of his predecessor H. H. Asquith, the time was not yet right to oust him from the Liberal leadership.Koss 1985, p232 Guest was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1920 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style \\"The Right Honourable\\", and in 1921 was promoted to Secretary of State for Air, a post he held until the Coalition fell from power in October 1922. In the general election of November 1922 Guest lost his seat but in 1923 was returned for Stroud, then in 1924 for Bristol North. After losing as a Liberal in the 1929 election, he rejoined the Conservative Party, winning as a Conservative for Plymouth Drake in 1931 and remaining in this position until his death. =Polo= Guest competed for Great Britain in polo at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The British Polo team received the Bronze Medal. He played alongside Frederick W. Barrett, Dennis Bingham and Kinnear Wise. Guest can be found among the winners of the Roehampton Trophy. He would also lend horses to the English polo team for the International Polo Cup matches. Family and private life On 28 June 1905, Guest married Amy Phipps (1873‚Äì1959), daughter of American industrialist Henry Phipps (1839‚Äì1930), at St George's, Hanover Square in London. Amy was prominent as a women's suffragist, philanthropist and aviation enthusiast and owned valuable property in Long Island. The couple were frequent visitors to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. They had a daughter and two sons who became American citizens: *Winston Frederick Churchill Guest (1906‚Äì1982), a polo player who married Helena Woolworth McCann and later Lucy Douglas Cochrane (1920‚Äì2003) *Raymond R. Guest (1907‚Äì1991), the United States Ambassador to Ireland from 1965‚Äì1968, who married three times to Elizabeth Polk, Ellen Tuck French Astor, and Princess Caroline Murat (1923‚Äì2012). *Diana Guest Manning (1909‚Äì1994) Apart from his political career he was an amateur motor racing driver and aeroplane pilot. In 1930, he became deputy master of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators, and master in 1932. He also played polo, was a big-game hunter in East Africa, and was a celebrated man-about- town in London and New York City society. Among his homes was Villa Artemis in Palm Beach, Florida and the former du Pont estate in Roslyn, New York. He was a member of the River and Links Clubs of New York and the Piping Rock Club in Long Island. He was also a friend of the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII. Guest died from cancer in 1937, at the age of 61.

Biography DeLorenzo was born in 1954, the son of Victor and Charlotte DeLorenzo, grew up in Racine, Wisconsin, and has lived in Milwaukee since. He has been a drummer since the age of 16, while attending St. Catherine's High School (Racine, Wisconsin), and has been an actor since the age of five. While attending the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, he auditioned for and was accepted into Theatre X in 1976, and worked with them in various roles for more than 20 years. As a drummer, DeLorenzo paired up with bassist Brian Ritchie in 1980, as a rhythm section they called \\"Violent Femmes\\". When singer, guitarist, and songwriter Gordon Gano joined them in 1981, the band kept the name. DeLorenzo's father loaned the band $10,000 to record their eponymous debut album in 1982. However, the band was forced to delay its release until 1983 after they signed to Slash Records. DeLorenzo's signature sound is a result of his minimalist drum kit. He often uses nothing more than a snare drum, a tranceaphone and steel brushes. The tranceaphone consists of a metal bushel basket inverted over a tom. He favors this style of kit because in their early days, the band often played on the streets. DeLorenzo continued to act with Theatre X, and record and tour with the Femmes until 1993, when he left to devote more time to acting and to recording his own music. He toured as part of Moe Tucker's band in that year. In 1996 he opened a recording studio called \\"Joe's Real Recording\\". He has released three solo records since 1990. In addition to recording his own music, he has played with several side projects, including Ash Can School.Metro Jam 1999 Gallery In 2000, he teamed up with Ritchie to put together a Femmes compilation, and subsequently rejoined the band until it disbanded again in 2009. In March 2013, Gano, Ritchie and DeLorenzo reformed Violent Femmes once more and played a homecoming show at the Summerfest music festival in their native Milwaukee. Three months later, in July, the band announced a new line-up with Dresden Dolls member Brian Viglione as the band's drummer. DeLorenzo confirmed in a statement that he had left the Femmes permanently because of a failure of the band members to resolve their long-standing business disputes. DeLorenzo performs percussion in the chamber rock duo Nineteen Thirteen with cellist Janet Schiff. Nineteen Thirteen's recording of \\"Hurricane Noel\\" was featured in the 2011 TED Global Conference.

Design Rotary viscous couplings with interleaved, perforated plates and filled with viscous fluids are used in automotive systems to transmit torque. The device consists of a number of circular plates with tabs or perforations, fitted very close to each other in a sealed drum. Alternate plates are connected to a driving shaft at one end of the assembly and a driven shaft at the other end. The drum is filled with a dilatant fluid, often silicone-based, to about 80% by volume. When the two sets of plates are rotating in unison, the fluid stays cool and remains liquid. When the plates start rotating at different speeds, the shear effect of the tabs or perforations on the fluid will cause it to heat and become nearly solid because the viscosity of dilatant fluids rapidly increases with shear. The fluid in this state will effectively glue the plates together and transmit power from one set of plates to the other. The size of the tabs or perforations, the number of plates, and the fluid used will determine the strength and onset of this mechanical transfer. This type of device essentially differs from fluid couplings such as torque converters by using the viscosity of the medium to transfer torque, rather than its momentum. This makes it potentially useful even on very small scales and requires less cooling. The torque transmitted is sensitive to the difference in speeds of the input and output but is almost independent of their common rate. Vehicles Viscous couplings are used as the center differential in some four-wheel-drive (4WD) vehicles. The first mass-produced viscous couplings for a permanent 4WD off-road-capable vehicle was in the AMC Eagle, which was produced from 1980 to 1988 model years. The AMC Eagle's single-speed model 119 New Process central differential used a viscous coupling filled with a liquid silicone-based material. It linked the front and rear differentials for quiet and smooth transfer of power to the axle with the greatest traction, on wet or dry pavement. Viscous couplings are used as the center differential in cars such as the Toyota Celica GT-Four, and also as a limited slip differential (LSD) in rear axles. They offer a cheaper way to implement four-wheel-drive than technologies like the mechanical-transfer Torsen differentials used by Audis. Volvo, Subaru, Land Rover, Vauxhall/Opel, and many others have also used viscous couplings in their drivelines at various times. They are now mostly superseded by electronically controlled devices.  Attributions  Tony Rolt is often credited with the original idea and development as applied to automatic couplings in vehicle transmission systems, particularly four-wheel drive, working with Freddie Dixon at the time. Ferguson Research and FF Developments were the companies formed (1970s) to commercialise much early work into 4WD systems and devices. It is thought that GKN Driveline own any remaining worldwide patents today and offer several variants and combinations of Viscous Couplings integrated with other driveline components. http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr047.html  Additional Information  \\"Visco\\" is a trademark of the Behr GmbH, Stuttgart.

It corresponds to the natural atoll of the same name. Traders and children waiting at the harbour of Rinbudhoo (Dhaalu Atoll) Maafushi in South Nilande Atoll Geography Dhaalu Atoll stretches 23km (14 mi) from east to west, and 38km (24 mi) north to south. Out of a total of 56 islands in the atoll, seven of the islands are inhabited, with a total population of around 6694. The capital island is Kudahuvadhoo, located at the atoll's southern tip. Hulhudheli and Rinbudhoo (Rimbudu) islands, located to the west of the atoll, are islands traditionally renowned for the skill of their jewellers. The formerly inhabited island of Gemendhoo on the eastern fringe of the atoll is surrounded by a long line of 11 uninhabited islands. The route from Bulhalafushi to Naibukaloabodufushi passes through these islands and can be walked in during low tide. Dhaalu Atoll Hospital is located in the island of Kudahuvadhoo.Dhaalu Atoll Hospital Dhaalu Atoll is accessible through regular domestic flights from Velana International Airport to Dhaalu Airport located on Kudahuvadhoo as well as local ferry services. History Some of the islands in this atoll have remains from the Buddhist period, but none of them have been properly excavated yet. Mysterious mounds known as hawittas are found in Kudahuvadhu. The old mosque of Kudahuvadhoo possesses some of the finest masonry in the country. Opened to tourism in 1998, the atoll has become a popular location for scuba diving. Gemendhoo was abandoned after the Boxing Day tsunamis destroyed the buildings. Rinbudhoo was also badly hit by the tsunami and half of the population were migrated to thulusdhoo. It is said Rinbudhoo was one of the islands having the highest density of population back in the early days. but now its just the opposite. The Island has an almost 300 years old masjid built with curved stones. Tourism Dhaalu Atoll is home to several luxury tourist resorts including St Regis Vommuli Maldives, Niyama Private Islands Maldives, Kandima Maldives, Angsana Velavaru, Vilu Reef, and Aaaveee.

Despite its scientific name, the Puerto Rican tody is endemic to the island and is locally known as \\"San Pedrito\\" (\\"Little Saint Peter\\"). The Puerto Rican tody makes up one of the five endemic Todus species of the Greater Antilles. Hispaniola has two endemic species, while Cuba, Jamaica and Puerto Rico each have one. The Puerto Rican tody differs from the other Greater Antilles todies in that it is the only species without pink or yellow- green colored feathers on its flanks.  Taxonomy  The Puerto Rican tody is the closest relative to the motmots of Central America. It is thought that the Jamaican tody (Todus todus) gave rise to the Puerto Rican tody after hurricane dispersals, but the relationship between both species has not yet been confirmed. Studies show the Todus group probably developed before the Pleistocene. Mitochondrial gene studies point to the motmots as their closest relative, although egg white protein electrophoresis studies suggest a relationship to kingfishers.  Description  thumb The Puerto Rican tody is a small, brightly colored, non-passerine forest bird. It is one of the smallest representative of the order Coraciiformes, with an average body length of 11 cm and weight of 5 to 6 g. The upperparts of the Puerto Rican tody are an emerald green color, and it has light-yellow flanks and underside tail coverts, and a white belly and chest. The \\"San Pedrito\\", also known as \\"Medio Peso\\" by the local people, has a red throat and lower bill, which in itself is long and broad. It can be as long or longer than the head, and as half as long as the wing. Their legs and feet are a brownish color and the tarsus is similar in length to the bill. Both males and females have a short tail, ranging from two-thirds to three-fourths as long as the wings. Males and females are not sexually dichromatic, and their only difference is their eye color; males have gray eyes whereas females' eyes are white. The young have similar colored feathers as the adults, but lack the red markings, have a grayish colored belly and have shorter bills.  Habitat  The Puerto Rican tody can be found throughout the main island of Puerto Rico. It is found predominantly in forested areas, especially in high-altitude damp forests where insect concentrations are higher, as well as in dense thickets, such as the Gu√°nica Forest located in the southern region of the island. = Territory = Todies have small territories. In lowland forests the tody's territory size is approximately 0.7 hectares (1.8 acres), but in higher elevations, where insect prey is less abundant, the territory size can increase up to two hectares per pair. Breeding territories are centered around the nest burrow and are smaller than their home ranges which are defended by the pair year- round.  Agonistic displays  When the Puerto Rican tody encounters an intruder it fluffs up and raises its crest. If disturbed, a bobbing up and down motion accompanied by vocalizations is portrayed; though both males and females are capable of this display, males tend to bob more. This bobbing display has also been seen after feeding and during nest building. Chasing intruders, wing flicking and wing rattles are also some of the other exhibited displays. The majority of these territorial defense displays is reserved for other todies, as they tend to be very tolerant of other species.  Diet  left The Puerto Rican tody is primarily insectivorous (85.9% of its diet). Todies eats katydids, grasshoppers, crickets, earwigs, dragonflies, flies, beetles, spiders (8.2%), and occasionally small lizards (3.5%) and frogs. Todies are considered voracious eaters. Todies forage and feed using different methods, including air-feeding and leaf feeding, the latter being the most common method of foraging. When they leaf feed they sit quietly in high perches and scan the surface below with fast, jerky head motions, often tilting their bills upwards. When the tody sees an insect on a leaf, it will capture it while in a short-curved flight. When todies air-feed, they have their bills pointed upward, and they fly from the perch snatching the insect and return to a different perch. Todies feed from different surfaces; the most common is leaves and the least common is the ground. The act of perching between foraging flights lasts for an average of 9.0 seconds and reach an average of 1.0 captures per minute in rain forests and 1.7 captures per minute in dense thicket habitats. The nestling's diet is different. Adults primarily feed their nestlings with the insects Homoptera (30%), Coleoptera (25%) and Lepidoptera (16%); but they have been found to supplement the hatchling's diet with fruits from Clusia krugiana (18.4%). Apart from insects and seeds, the adults also feed their nestlings frogs and lizards, although between those two, frogs are more common.  Reproduction The species has single broods and is monogamous. Its courtship reaches its peak between February and May and occurs in the breeding area, not far from the nesting site. The ritual consists of chasing each other while rattling the wings. Both male and females achieve a \\"flank\\" display before copulating, where they fluff out their flanks causing a spherical ball appearance. The female lifts her tail and enters into a submissive posture to facilitate copulation. During courtship their vocalization becomes agitated and accelerated. = Nesting and incubation = The Puerto Rican tody has an unusual nesting technique. During and eight week period, the male and female todies excavate a 25 to 35 cm long, narrow burrow with a right angle in an earth bank. They create their nest at the end of this burrow. This process usually occurs between the months of February and June, before the start of the wet season. Females start laying their eggs 3 to 4 weeks after the nest has been completed. The female lays 1 to 4 bright white eggs, with an average of 2.3 eggs, on consecutive nights. The weight of each egg is equivalent to about one quarter of the females body weight. The responsibility of incubating the eggs is shared by both the male and the female for an average of 21 days, and later on other adult todies (usually previous offsprings) may assist in the development process of the chicks after the chicks have fledged. If nestlings are killed, as well as during incubation and brooding, the mate will bring prey items to the nest. The clutch size and breeding productivity of this species seems to be greater in shaded coffee plantations compared to species in secondary forests in the north-central area of the island. Todies use half the burrows they excavate. Of all the burrows excavated in their territory, 62.5% and 33% of the nests in dense thickets and rainforest habitats are used respectively. Even though every year new burrows are excavated, 89% of them are 10 meters away from the old ones.  Behavior  Puerto Rican todies are rarely seen on the ground; they usually prefer perching, unless when nesting. When todies are on the ground they hop. An unusual fact is that to enter their burrow they have a favorite perching spot on which they land before heading to their nest. The Puerto Rican tody, unlike other Coraciiformes, roosts alone in trees both during the day and at nighttime. thumb  Physiology  The Puerto Rican tody has been researched extensively because of its unusual body temperature, body temperature control and temperature control abilities. Puerto Rican todies exhibit lower body temperatures than other todies, and have also exhibited heterothermy over a range of temperatures. Most coraciiformes have a body temperature of 40 ¬∞C, but Puerto Rican todies can maintain a body temperature of 36.7 ¬∞C. This allows them to spend 33% less energy than other Coraciiformes. Puerto Rican Todies can lower their body temperatures by 14 ¬∞C. This physiological response varies by both season and sex; only females in breeding season are capable of becoming torpid, although not all individuals become torpid at the same body temperature. During this torpid stage, they are unresponsive, have their eyes closed and erected plumage, but are capable of taking flight soon after an increase in temperature.  Status and conservation  This tody is a common endemic species to the island of Puerto Rico. It is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. During the past, the Puerto Rican tody suffered from human predation as it was captured as food. Currently it suffers from nest predation by introduced Indian mongooses. Other threats include habitat destruction and the transition of shaded coffee plantations into sun coffee plantations.

This cuisine had adaptations and influences throughout its history, including early on from the nearby Apache, Navajo, and throughout New Spain and the Spanish Empire, also from French, Italian, Mediterranean, Portuguese cuisine, and European caf√©s, furthermore during the American territorial phase from cowboy chuckwagons and Western saloons, additionally after statehood from Route 66 American diners, fast food restaurants, and global cuisine. Even so, New Mexican cuisine developed in fairly isolated circumstances, which has allowed it to maintain its indigenous, Spanish, and Mexican identity, and is therefore not like any other Latin food originating in the contiguous United States. It can be easily distinguished from other Mexican and American cuisines, due to its emphasis on New Mexican spices, herbs, and flavors; especially red and/or green New Mexico chile peppers, anise (used in bizcochitos), and pi√±on (used as a snack or in desserts). It is also identifiable by the presence of foods and dishes that originate in New Mexico, such as Native American frybread-style sopapillas, breakfast burritos, enchilada montada (stacked enchiladas), green chile stew, carne adovada (pork marinated in red chile), carne seca (a thinly sliced variant of jerky), green chile burgers, posol√© (a hominy dish), slow-cooked frijoles/beans (typically pinto beans), and calabacitas (a saut√©ed zucchini and summer squash dish). History A horno Prior to the establishment of New Mexico's current boundaries, Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico's land claim encompassed the Pueblo peoples and also oversaw the land of the Chiricahua, Comanche, Mescalero, and Navajo. The Spaniards brought their cuisine which mingled with the indigenous. They introduced wheat, rice, beef, mutton/lamb, among other foods and flavors, to the native corn, chile, beans, squash, and other indigenous ingredients. During this early development period the Horno, an outdoor beehive-shaped earth oven, became ubiquitous in Pueblo and Hispano communities. This distinct history‚Äîcombined with the local terrain and climate‚Äîhas resulted in significant differences between the cuisine of New Mexico and somewhat similar styles in Northern Mexico, and other Southwestern US states such as California, Arizona, and Texas. Many residents in the north and the capital, Santa Fe, are descended from Spanish noblemen and explorers who came in the 16th century. Nuevo M√©xico also took part in the Mexican revolution and the development of early Mexican culture. \\"Anglos\\" and African Americans traded and settled after the Civil War. New Mexico's population includes Native Americans who have been on the land thousands of years. Most recently, Asian and Indochinese immigrants have discovered New Mexico.Feske, Esther. License to Cook New Mexico Style, Penfield Press, 1988, p. 5 When New Mexicans refer to chile they are talking about pungent pods, or sauce made from those pods, not the concoction of spices, meat or beans known as Texas chili con carne. While chile, the pod, is sometimes spelled chili, chilli, or chillie elsewhere, US Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico made this state's spelling official in a sense, by entering it into the Congressional Record. One of the first authors to publish a cookbook describing traditional New Mexican cuisine was educator and writer Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert, who published Historic Cookery in 1931. Her work helped introduce cooking with chiles to the United States more broadly. Ingredients=Chile= New Mexico chile is the defining ingredient of New Mexican food. Chile is New Mexico's largest agricultural crop. Within New Mexico, green chile is also popular in non-New Mexican cuisines including Mexican-style food and American food like cheeseburgers, french fries, bagels, and pizza. The New Mexico official State Question is \\"Red or green?\\" This refers to the choice of red or green chile with an entr√©e. \\"Christmas,\\" a relatively new tradition originating in the 1980s, is a request for both (one side covered with green, the other with red). New Mexico red and green chile have such a rich and distinctive flavor that traditional preparations require few additional flavoring ingredients. The essence of New Mexico chile preparation is its simplicity. The New Mexico green chile is a variety of the chile pepper, Capsicum annuum, and was developed as a recognizable strain in New Mexico by the late nineteenth century. It is available today in several distinct and selectively-cultivated strains called cultivars. The chile pepper is grown in the state's very high altitude (4,000‚Äì8,000 ft) and dry, hot climate. Much like grapes for wine, these growing conditions contribute, along with genetics, to giving New Mexico green chile its distinctive deep green color, texture, and flavor. The climate of New Mexico tends to increase the capsaicin levels in the chile pod compared to pods grown in other regions. This results in the possibility of hotter varieties. New Mexico green chiles can range from mild to extremely hot. An index of vendors of certified New Mexico chile within and outside the state. At harvest time (August through the middle of October) green chile is typically roasted, peeled and frozen for the year ahead. Chile is such a staple in New Mexico that many national restaurant chains offer New Mexico chile at their New Mexico locations. New Mexico red chile is simply the fully ripened green chile pepper. As it ripens, it first turns orange and then quickly turns red. As it does so, the skin thickens and fuses to the inner fruit or \\"meat\\" of the pepper. This means that, for the red pepper to be enjoyable, it must first be dried then blended into a puree. The puree can be made using full red chile pods or red chile powder (which is made by finely grinding the dried pod). The pur√©e is not edible until cooked as red chile sauce. This is made by cooking the puree with garlic, salt ‚Äì and occasionally oregano ‚Äì and has the consistency of tomato soup. Discerning native New Mexicans prefer sun-dried over oven-dried red chile, as the oven- drying process gives it a non-traditional smoky flavor and a dark maroon color. Red chile peppers are traditionally sun-dried in bundles called , which are a common decorative sight on porches and in homes and businesses throughout the Southwest. The process of creating the ristra is highly labor- intensive, so the ristra in recent decades has become a predominantly decorative item. The bulk of New Mexico chile is grown in the Hatch Valley in the south of the state, in and around the village of Hatch. It is also grown along the entire Rio Grande Valley, and Chimayo in the north is also well known for its chile. = Pi√±on = Pi√±ones, or pi√±on nuts, are a traditional food of Native Americans and Hispanos in New Mexico that is harvested from the ubiquitous pi√±on pine tree. The state of New Mexico protects the use of the word pi√±on for use with pine nuts from certain species of indigenous New Mexican pines. The harvest doesn‚Äôt generally arrive in full force until after New Mexico‚Äôs first freeze of the winter. =Other ingredients= alt= Wheat flour tortillas are more prevalent in New Mexico cuisine as a table bread than corn tortillas. However, corn tortillas, corn tortilla chips, and masa are the foundations of many traditional New Mexico dishes, and sometimes made of blue corn. Common traditional dishes include enchiladas, tacos, posole, tamales, and sopaipillas and honey served with the meal. However Corn (maize) remains a staple grain, the yellow sweet corn variety is most common in New Mexico, though white is sometimes used, and blue and red flint corn varieties are used for specialties like and blue-corn tortilla chips. Kernel corn and corn on the cob are frequent side dishes, as in the American South. Corn is not a frequent component of New Mexico or Pico de gallo, and is usually a separate side dish in and of itself. Anise is common in some desserts, especially the state cookie, the bizcochito. Cilantro, a pungent green herb (also called Mexican or Chinese parsley, the seeds of which are known as coriander) used fresh in salsas, and as a topping for virtually any dish; not common in traditional New Mexican cuisine, but one of the defining tastes of Santa Fe style. Cumin, the quintessential \\"Mexican food\\" spice, is used very differently in New Mexican food, usually reserved for spicing ground beef and sometimes other meats for burritos, tacos, and nachos. It is not used to flavor red and green chile sauces. Oregano is a sparingly used but common herb used in traditional New Mexican dishes. The early Spanish Colonies along the Rio Grande River in New Mexico used safflower as a substitute for saffron in traditional recipes. An heirloom variety originating from Corrales, New Mexico called \\"Corrales Azafran\\" is still cultivated and used as a saffron substitute in New Mexican cuisine. Foods and dishes Biscochitos, the state cookie of New Mexico Chile con queso Sopaipillas *': sweet rice pudding, a traditional Northern New Mexican desert, primarily popular in traditional homes, and rarely found in restaurants. Rice is generally cooked in milk and water. Then, simmered with sugar and raisins, garnished with cinnamon, and served hot. *': a thick, hot gruel made from blue corn meal in New Mexico. *': anise-flavored cookie sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, traditionally made with lard. It was developed by residents of New Mexico over the centuries from the first Spanish colonists of what was then known as Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico. Although Biscochitos may sometimes be found at any time of year, they are a traditional Christmas cookie. *Breakfast burrito: a breakfast version of the above, typically including scrambled eggs, potatoes, red or green chile, cheese (usually Cheddar), and sometimes bacon. *': Chopped summer squash with onions, garlic, yellow corn, green chile, sauteed in oil. *': a thin, green or red chile stew or soup of meat (usually beef, often pork or a mixture), potatoes, and chiles. Sometimes called , especially as a side dish. Both terms are diminutive forms of the Spanish word, , for soup. *': a bread-pudding dessert, traditionally made during Lent festivities. Capirotada is made of toasted bread crumbs or fried slices of birote or bolillo bread, then soaked in a syrup made of melted sugar, or 'piloncillo, and cinnamon. It usually contains raisins, and possibly other fruits and nut bits. Finely grated cheese may be added when it's still hot from the oven, so that it melts. Served warm or cold. *': Cubes of pork that have been marinated and slow-cooked in red chile sauce, garlic and oregano,. *', literally translated to \\"dried meat\\", in New Mexican cuisine refers to a unique style of thinly sliced jerky which has a cracker or potato chip-like texture. *Chile sauce: A sauce made from red or green chiles usually served hot. Green chile is made with chopped, roasted fresh or frozen green chiles, while red chile is made from dried, roasted and pulverized ripe (red) chiles. Chile is one of the most definitive differences between New Mexican and other Mexican and Mexican-American cuisines (which often make a different green chile sauce from tomatillos). New Mexican cuisine uses chile sauce as taco sauce, enchilada sauce, burrito sauce, etc. (though any given meal may use both red and green varieties for different dishes). A thicker version of green chile with onions and other additions is called green chile stew and is popular in Albuquerque-style New Mexican food. The green chile sauce is can sometimes be hotter than its red counterpart, though this depends entirely on the chile varieties used. *Green chile stew: similar to with the use of green chile. Standard ingredients are coarsely-chopped green chile, ground or cubed beef, ground or cubed pork, potato, diced tomato, onion, garlic, and chicken or beef stock. *', also called a stacked enchilada', is usually covered with either red or green chile sauce, and optionally topped with a fried egg. These stacked enchiladas are also common with blue-corn tortillas. *': soft custard- like dessert made from egg whites, milk, white sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon - cooked while whisking on a stove top and served either warm or cold. *Navajo taco: A taco made with frybread, rather than a tortilla. *': a thick stew made with hominy and pork. Chicken in lieu of pork is a popular variation. It is simmered for hours with pork or chicken and then combined with red or green chile plus other ingredients such as onion, garlic, and oregano. Native New Mexicans include off-cuts of pork (especially pork rinds and pigs feet) in the pork version. They also prefer to use the un-popped hominy kernel, either blue or white, which goes by the same name as the dish, \\"posole.\\". The un-popped kernels are boiled separately from the other ingredients until the kernels pop revealing the hominy-like form. To New Mexicans, posole is one of the most important of Christmas traditions. The Mexican spelling is uncommon in New Mexico. *': a pudding made from sprouted wheat flour and piloncillo. The sprouted-wheat flour is called \\"panocha flour,\\" or simply \\"panocha\\", as well. *Pastelitos: (\\"little pies\\") a thin pie baked on flat cookie sheet with dried fruit and spices, usually cut into small squares. *' (or sopapilla): a puffed fried quick bread with a flavor similar to Indian Fry Bread. The New Mexico version is very large. It is served as a standard table bread at New Mexican restaurants with a squeeze bottle of honey or honey butter. Prior to the Great Depression in the 1930s, they were served with jelly or jam, and honey was used as a substitute and from then on became the traditional accompaniment. They can also become an entr√©e by stuffing them with savory ingredients such ground beef, shredded chicken, and refried beans. **Stuffed Sopapilla - A standard New Mexico entr√©e, it is a sopapilla stuffed it with various fillings, covered with melted cheddar cheese. It is usually smothered with red or green chile sauce and topped with shredded iceberg lettuce and diced tomatoes. Fillings include pinto beans, ground beef, shredded beef, shredded chicken, potatoes, spanish rice, and carne adovada. *' a traditional New Mexico side dish made with spinach sauteed in bacon fat with onion, garlic, pinto beans, and crushed, red, New Mexico chile flakes. Wild lamb's quarters were the original leafy green for this dish, but now it is extremely rare to find quelites made with them. *Spanish rice: rice () with a tomato base and other ingredients; usually a mild dish, but may also be made spicy. Traditional New Mexico versions are made with long-grain rice, onion, and garlic. Rice may also be served in other fashions, and recipes vary. *': Meatball soup - traditionally made with beef broth, ground pork or beef, vegetables and rice. Also known as . Alb√≥ndigas is the term for the dish as well as the meatball itself. *': The New Mexico burrito is a white flour tortilla with fillings of meat, such as pork carnitas, chicken, ground or shredded beef or carne adovada or refried pinto beans or both meat and beans, along with red or green chile. *': roasted or broiled meat (often flank steak), marinated. *Carnitas: grilled or broiled cubes of pork traditionally smothered with red or green chile sauce and served as and entree. *': originating in California-style Mexican cuisine, a corn tortilla fried into a bowl shape and filled with shredded chicken or other meat or beans, and usually topped with guacamole and salsa. (another vegetable-laden version called taco salads; compare with tostadas.) *': deep-fried pieces of pork trimmings usually including a layer of meat. *': chile and melted cheese mixed together into a dip. *': whole green chiles stuffed with cheese, dipped in egg batter, and fried. This dish varies from other Mexican-style cuisines in that it uses the New Mexican chile, rather than a poblano pepper. *': a small, deep-fried meat and (usually) bean wheat-tortilla burrito, also containing (or smothered with) chile sauce and cheese; popularized by the Allsup's convenience store chain with a series of humorous commercials in the 1980s with candid footage of people attempting and failing to pronounce the name correctly. Chimichangas, like flautas and taquitos, are a fast-food adaptation of traditional dishes in a form that can be stored frozen and then quickly fried as needed; they are also rigid and easily hand-held, and thus easy to eat by people while walking or driving. *': spicy pork sausage, seasoned with garlic and red chile, usually used in ground or finely chopped form as a breakfast side dish or quite often as an alternative to ground beef or shredded chicken in other dishes. *': a little empanada; a pasty or turnover filled with sweet pumpkin, fruit, or minced meat, spices and nuts. *': corn tortillas filled with chicken, meat or cheese. They are either rolled, or stacked, and covered with chile sauce and cheese. *Fish: Being landlocked, New Mexico has no native sea food tradition, but freshwater fish are not uncommon entrees, especially trout. Crayfish are found in New Mexico. In the southeast of the state, crayfish tails are also consumed, as in Texas and Louisiana. While the native population made use of freshwater shellfish since prehistoric times, they are not common in modern New Mexico cuisine, though it has adapted various sea food items (e.g., shrimp tacos are common in restaurants). *': a caramel custard. *': a small, tightly rolled, fried corn tortilla filled with ground beef, chicken, pork or turkey and served topped with guacamole and sour cream. Compare chimichanga and taquito. *': whole pinto beans. Along with Spanish rice, frijoles are the standard side served with any entr√©e. Traditional New Mexico beans are cooked very simply with salt pork and garlic. Frijoles are often served whole in New Mexico, rather than as refried beans (). *': refried beans. The whole cooked beans are fried in bacon fat and mashed until they turn into a thick paste. Also known as simply and often served with a topping of cheese. *Frito pie: A Tex-Mex casserole, made of red chile sauce, sometimes with meat and or pinto beans, atop a bed of Fritos (or similar) corn chips, topped with cheese, and usually topped with shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and onion. Some five and dime stores make it by slicing open a bag of Frito's and adding the rest of the ingredients. Although a Texas invention, it has become popular in New Mexico, and typically uses New Mexican red chile in the state. *': traditional New Mexico version is avocados smashed or blended with a very small amount of the following: finely chopped onion, tomato, garlic, salt and lemon juice. *': Fried eggs any style on corn tortillas, smothered with red or green chile sauce, and topped with shredded cheddar cheese - often served with potatoes and/or pinto beans. Flour tortillas on the side come standard. *': a small, fat chile pepper, ranging from mild to painfully hot. In New Mexican food they are used chopped (fresh) in salsa and guacamole or as a topping (either pickled or fresh) for nachos. *' ('rooster's beak'): A cold salsa with thick-chopped fresh chiles, tomatoes, onions and cilantro, it does not have a tomato paste base like commercial packaged salsas, and never contains vinegar. *': a grilled cheese sandwich of sorts in which two flour tortillas, or one folded, are used instead of bread. The quesadilla is often lightly oiled and toasted on a griddle, to melt the cheese, then served with either salsa, pico de gallo, chile, guacamole, and/or sour cream, as an appetizer or entr√©e. *': generally an uncooked mixture of chiles/peppers, tomatoes, onions, and frequently blended or mixed with tomato paste to produce a more sauce-like texture than pico de gallo; usually contains lemon juice or vinegar in noticeable quantities. The green chile variant usually is mostly green chile and without tomatoes, though some varieties may use some cooked tomatillos; the style does not use avocado (which is very common in California green salsa). The New Mexico and California styles share a typically large amount of cilantro added to the mix. The word simply means 'sauce' in Spanish. *': a corn tortilla fried into a trough shape, it is filled with meats or beans, and fresh chopped lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese. The term can also refers to the soft, rolled flour-tortilla variety popularized by fast-food chains (a soft taco), and the flat, unfriend corn style favored in Mexico, but most corn tortillas for tacos are fried in New Mexican cuisine. The entire taco is not fried (a Mexican style known as ), just the shell. Compare , . *' (plural '): meat rolled in cornmeal dough (), wrapped traditionally in corn husks (waxed paper is sometimes used for commercial versions), and steamed. Although there are many delicious variations, the standard New Mexico tamal filling is shredded pork cooked in red chile sauce. New Mexican tamales typically vary from other tamal styles in that red chile powder is typically blended into the masa. *' a tightly rolled, deep-fried variant of the corn-tortilla taco, usually filled with beef or chicken; essentially the same as a Mexican , but rolled into a tube shape rather than friend in wedge shape. Sometimes misspelled \\"taquita\\". Compare and . *': A whipped-egg and wheat-flour pancake, typically topped with red chile, and often and it is then served with (a vermicelli-style noodle), (wild spinach), and beans. It is a traditional dish for Fridays during Lent; some New Mexican restaurants offer it as their Lenten special. *': a flatbread made predominantly either of unbleached white wheat flour or of cornmeal, with wheat flour tortillas the most common in ordinary use. New Mexico-style flour tortillas are typically thicker and less chewy than those found in Sonora, Mexico. Nevertheless, blue-corn tortillas are a quintessential New Mexico- style tortilla. *': a corn tortilla is deep fried flat until hard and crispy and covered with refried beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato, with additional toppings such as sour cream and guacamole also added. *Green chile cheeseburger: widely considered the New Mexican variety of cheeseburger, it is a regular hamburger that is topped with melted cheese and either whole or chopped green chile. The flavor is very distinctively New Mexican as opposed to other types of hamburgers, and is even offered in the region by major fast food chains. *Green chile cheese fries: a New Mexican variant to traditional cheese fries, fries served smothered with green chile sauce and topped with cheese. *Indian Fry Bread: A traditional thick flatbread of deep-fried dough, developed by the Navajo people after the \\"Long Walk\\", when they were forcibly relocated to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico. Served as a snack with honey or for making Navajo tacos. The New Mexico sopaipilla is a variant of this. *' or picante sauce: A thin, vinegary, piquant (thus its name) sauce of pure√©d red peppers and tomatoes with spices, it is reminiscent of a combination of New Mexico-style chile sauce and Louisiana-style tabasco pepper sauce. (Note: American commercial food producers have appropriated the term to refer simply to spicy packaged salsa.) Picante's place in Mexican, Tex-Mex and Californian food, where it is extremely common, especially as a final condiment to add more heat, has largely been supplanted by chile, especially red chile, in New Mexican cuisine.

The catalog lists 9,110 objects, of which 9,095 are stars, 11 are novae or supernovae,These are HR 92, 182, 1057, 1841, 2472, 5958, 6309, 6515, 7189, 7539 and 8296. and four are non-stellar objects which are the globular clusters 47 Tucanae (designated HR 95) and NGC 2808 (HR 3671), and the open clusters NGC 2281 (HR 2496) and Messier 67 (HR 3515). The catalogue is fixed in number of entries, but its data is maintained, and it is appended with a comments section about the objects that has been steadily enhanced. The abbreviation for the catalog as a whole is BS or YBS but all citations of stars it indexes use HR before the catalog number, a homage to the catalog's direct predecessor, published in 1908, named the Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue. History The earliest predecessor of the YBS, titled Harvard Photometry, was published in 1884 by the Harvard College Observatory under the supervision of Edward Charles Pickering, and contained about 4,000 stars. Following its release, Pickering promoted a broader stellar survey for the southern celestial hemisphere, equally as thorough as the Harvard Photometry of 1884. This photometry work was carried out by Solon I. Bailey between 1889 and 1891, leading to the publication of the Revised Harvard Photometry in 1908. The new catalogue contained stars down to magnitude 6.5 in both hemispheres, for which John A. Parkhurst continued work through the 1920s. The Yale Bright Star Catalogue has been steadily enhanced since the Yale astronomer Frank Schlesinger published the first version in 1930; even though the YBS is limited to the objects already in the catalog, the data for the objects already listed is corrected and extended, and it is appended with a comments section about the objects.

A night \\"on the razzle\\" does not carry completely negative connotations; it is only used to describe someone as having enjoyed themselves. There are several theories as to the origin of the phrase. *The OED suggests that \\"on the razzle\\" is a shortening of \\"on the razzle-dazzle\\", which is found at least as early as the 1890s: \\"I live ever so quietly; I don't drink; I don't bet much; and I never go regularly on the razzle-dazzle as you did when you were my age.\\" * Another suggestion is that it came about during World War I, when ships were often painted in bright zigzag patterns to confuse German U-boats. Sailors often came back on the supply ships from North America after consuming a large quantity of alcohol, and were said to have been \\"on the razzle\\". This derivation seems unlikely given the much earlier (1890s) use of the phrase \\"on the razzle-dazzle\\". * Another theory is that there was a gin parlour notorious for the extreme merriment of its customers in London during the 1750s. Its proprietor, who called himself \\"Dash Razzall,\\" was an unscrupulous man of Italian descent. It is unclear as to how his name mutated into razzle, but his gin parlour was renowned for the amount of alcohol consumed, and that after he went bankrupt his family moved to Sussex, where they became renowned as being prone to overindulge. Playwright Tom Stoppard used this phrase as the title of a 1981 farce, On the Razzle, which he adapted from an earlier play by Johann Nestroy.

It was released on Columbia Records in November 1971, one year after its predecessor, Christmas and the Beads of Sweat. The album is Nyro's only all- covers album, and she interprets mainly 1950s and 1960s soul and R&B; standards, using Labelle as a traditional back-up vocal group. Nyro had originally hatched the idea to do a covers album during 1970, and on her tour to support the Christmas and the Beads of Sweat album she introduced several of the songs that would later appear on Gonna Take a Miracle, including \\"Spanish Harlem\\" and \\"Dancing in the Street\\". Gonna Take a Miracle remains a critics' favorite Laura Nyro record for its laidback atmosphere and impressive soul grooves and musicianship, as well as classic \\"Philadelphia soul\\" production from Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. It was her last commercially successful album, peaking at #46 on the Billboard 200, then known as the Pop Albums chart, as well as #41 on the Black Albums chart. The album was Nyro's last for over four years as she turned her back on the music industry to get married and live a rural life away from the spotlight. Her work with Patti LaBelle on the album formed a lifelong friendship. In 2005, music magazine The Word voted Gonna Take a Miracle among the 60 Best Underrated Albums of All Time. Background Nyro first met Patti LaBelle in 1970 when she was about to give an interview to LaBelle's manager Vicki Wickham. Wickham brought LaBelle along to the interview, where she engaged in deep conversation with Nyro. They went on the road together, with LaBelle cooking for Nyro. Production The album was recorded in May and June 1971 at Sigma Sound Studios, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The producers were Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Patti LaBelle and her vocal partners in Labelle, Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash, were brought in as backing singers. Nyro was the main selector of material for the album, and chose songs she was influenced by growing up in the Bronx of the 1950s and 1960s. The songs include The Shirelles' \\"I Met Him on a Sunday\\", The Originals' \\"The Bells\\" (written by Marvin Gaye), Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' \\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\", Ben E. King's \\"Spanish Harlem\\", The Charts' \\"Deserie/Desiree\\", Major Lance's \\"The Monkey Time\\" (written by Curtis Mayfield)., and The Royalettes' \\"It's Gonna Take a Miracle\\". The album balances the grittier numbers with the more ethereal soul ballad, \\"The Wind\\" and the sultry love ballad, \\"D√©siree\\". Nyro, Labelle and Gamble and Huff mixed genres including doo-wop, soul, R&B;, pop, Brill Building, and gospel. \\"Despite Gamble and Huff's presence on the project, Nyro remained fully in charge,\\" wrote biographer Michele Kort.Kort, Michele.

Best known for his appearances with Pro Wrestling NOAH in Japan and Ring of Honor in the United States, Morgan received tryouts with World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation in 1997 and 1998, but was not hired. Professional wrestling career Vassos graduated from Ripon Christian High School in 1994 at the age of eighteen, and attended Modesto Junior College for a year before deciding to become a professional wrestler. He left college at the age of twenty and attended the APW Boot Camp in Hayward, California where he was trained by Michael Modest and Ric Thompson for two years. He debuted in All Pro Wrestling on June 29, 1996 in Hayward, California as \\"Donovan Morgan\\", facing Dwayne Jones. Soon after his debut, Morgan began feuding with his trainer, Michael Modest. Morgan's first title win in APW was on January 25, 1997, when he and his partner, Robert Thompson, defeated Modest and Steve Rizzono for the APW Tag Team Championships in a Two out of three falls match, winning two straight falls. They held the titles until August 1, when they lost to Tony Jones and Jay Smooth. Morgan continued his feud with Modest, and on July 7 they faced one another in a match for the vacant APW Universal Heavyweight Championship. Modest was victorious, but Morgan continued to pursue the title, eventually defeating Modest for the Universal Heavyweight Championship on September 5 in what was considered a major upset. Modest regained the title less than a month later on October 3. In early 2000, Morgan formed a stable with Vinny Massaro and Vanilla Frost called \\"The New Breed\\". On April 15, 2000 Morgan defeated Boyce LeGrande for the APW Internet Championship in the finals of a one night tournament (the previous champion, Christopher Daniels, had been signed by World Championship Wrestling and subsequently stripped of the belt). After Morgan won the Universal Heavyweight Championship for a second time, defeating Ed Moretti on October 7, 2000, he was informed by APW Commissioner Gabe Ramirez that he was not allowed to hold two titles simultaneously, so he vacated the Internet Championship on October 28. After Morgan lost the Universal Heavyweight Championship to Vic Capri on April 28, 2001 he immediately began pursuing the Internet Championship once more, beating Vinny Massaro on May 19. He was stripped of the title on November 27 after he left APW along with Modest and several other wrestlers following a disagreement with APW owner Roland Alexander. Until he left APW, Morgan acted as the head camp instructor of the APW professional wrestling school. He was replaced by Spanky and The American Dragon. Morgan formed a tag team with Modest known as \\"Excellence, Inc.\\", and the duo began touring Japan with the NOAH promotion on July 14, 2001. Morgan and Modest became Noah regulars, often facing Japanese legend Mitsuharu Misawa. Morgan and Modest formed a stable in Noah with fellow gaijins 2 Cold Scorpio and Bison Smith known as Team KAOS. After leaving All Pro Wrestling, Morgan and Modest decided to open their own gym, \\"The Tetsu Academy\\". They later opened their own promotion in conjunction with the training center, \\"Pro Wrestling Iron\\", which held its first show on May 31, 2002 in Ukiah, California. Morgan and Modest eventually negotiated a talent swap agreement with Noah that saw Japanese wrestlers such as Misawa, Naoya Ogawa, and Takao Omori appear on PWI shows. Morgan and Modest continued to team in PWI and defeated Los Maximos in a match to decide the first ever PWI Tag Team Championships on June 11, 2004. They lost the titles to Frank Murdoch and Bart Blaxton on January 8, 2005. In addition, they continue to train wrestlers at the Tetsu Academy. August 31, 2005 marked the end of the Tetsu Academy, with a final show at the PWI dojo in Hayward, California on August 27, 2005. On September 21, 2002, Morgan and Christopher Daniels, known collectively as The Prophecy, won a tournament to crown the first ever ROH Tag Team Champions, defeating Modest and his partner, The American Dragon. They held the titles until March 15, 2003, when they were defeated by A.J. Styles and Amazing Red. Morgan and Modest left ROH soon after following disputes over accommodation and schedule clashes with their Japanese commitments. On the February 18, 2006 episode of TNA Impact!, Morgan teamed with Michael Modest and Ryan Drago as La Migra. The trio were defeated by The Latin American Xchange. On the March 3, 2006 episode of TNA Xplosion, Morgan and Modest were defeated by The Naturals. On October 21, 2007, Vassos, as Chicano Flame, appeared at Wrestle Fan Fest 2007, and wrestled National Championship Wrestling (NCW) World Champion the New York Gangster on the AWA show in a non-title match in the Cow Palace in Daly City, California. Morgan became a mortgage broker in 2006.

First devised by Michael Michaels of Miami Beach, FL, it is an 's cuebid in opponent's opening suit and is normallySome partnerships use it as a weak three-suited takeout bid. See used to show a two-suited hand with at least five cards in each suit and eight or more points. After the opponents have opened at the one-level, the overcaller bids the same suit at the two-level; the two normal cases are: #Over an opponent's minor opening, a cuebid shows both majors. For example, 1 - 2 shows hearts and spades. #Over an opponent's major opening, a cuebid shows the other major and a minor suit. For example, 1 - 2 shows hearts and either clubs or diamonds. Partner can make a 2NT relay bid to request partner to bid his minor suit. Partnerships who have incorporated Michaels cuebid amongst their agreements usually also play the unusual notrump convention. Requirements Point count requirements vary and are a matter of partnership agreement. It is commonly agreed that a Michaels cuebid is constructive and should be made on hands that hold the prospect of winning the auction; hand emphasis is on trick-taking capability suggesting for suits containing most of the HCP and having good texture, particularly at unfavourable vulnerability. With less than eight points, Michaels is not recommended - the chances of winning the auction are small and gives the opponents too much information. Bidders expecting to make or sacrifice can use basic Michaels at all point ranges with eight or more. In a common variant, known as Mini-Maxi Michaels, candidate hands are classed into three ranges and Michaels is applied more selectively: *Weak - 8 to 12 points: use Michaels *Intermediate - 13 to 15 points: do not use Michaels, bid the higher suit followed by the lower *Strong - 16 or more points: use Michaels Responses to Michaels Initially, partner should assume a weak hand by the Michaels bidder; with a strong hand, the Michaels bidder will follow with a second non-forced call. Responses to the Michaels cuebid include: *A preference bid *A jump preference bid (usually preemptive) *A cuebid of opener's suit, which is a game or slam try *A new suit, non-forcing *2NT. When the cuebid is in a major suit, asks partner to name his minor suit *3NT is to play *4 serves the same purpose as 2NT in competitive auctions when 2NT is no longer available. 4NT serves the same purpose as 2NT when 2NT and 4 are not available. Rebids by the Michaels bidder *With 12 or fewer, pass or raise. Raise is not invitational, it shows 6/5 or better and is optional and preemptive *With 16 or more, bid a new suit inviting game Modifications Several modifications and extensions exist, such as the Modified Michaels cuebid, Leaping Michaels and Super Michaels. In the Netherlands, a particular modification is growing in popularity: over opponent's opening, a cuebid shows a major and a minor unbid suit. The 2NT overcall is then used to show both majors (after a minor suit opening) or both minors (after a major suit opening). This approach allows all three two suiters in the three unbid suits to be indicated. Compared to standard Michaels, the disadvantage is that after an opposing minor suit opening, one cannot introduce a two suiter in the majors at the two-level. Also, the cuebid invariably leaves one of both suits unspecified. A variant often referred to as upper cuebid is popular in Germany. In this treatment a cuebid shows the highest unbid suit and another unspecified suit. Together with the unusual notrump convention to indicate the lowest of the two unbid suits, this approach allows all two suiters in the three unbid suits to be indicated. Compared to standard Michaels, the disadvantage is that after an opposing minor suit opening, one cannot describe a two suiter in the majors in one bid. Also, Michaels cuebid variants exist that remove any ambiguity on what is the second suit. An example is the hi-hi cuebid that over opponent's opening invariably shows the highest unbid suits. Together with the unusual notrump convention to indicate the lowest of the two unbid suits, this hi-hi cuebid allows two out of the three possible two suiters in the unbid suits to be specified in one single bid. A drawback of this method is that the hi-hi cuebid does not cater for two-suiters in the highest and lowest unbid suits. Defense The opening side may defend against a Michaels cuebid or any other conventional two-suited overcall with the Unusual vs. Unusual convention. This defense assigns conventional meanings to a double and to cuebids of the suits shown by the two-suited overcall. Comparison to Ghestem Ghestem is more precise in terms of uniquely defining the specific suits denoted. Another drawback compared to Ghestem is that following an opposing minor suit opening, the Michaels cuebid used in combination with the unusual notrump convention does not cater for a two-suiter in spades and the other minor. Hands like these can only be indicated by overcalling 1 and, if possible, later introducing the minor suit. However, Ghestem has the disadvantage that after a 1 of a minor opening, you cannot choose a major at the two level, as the cuebid to show both majors is 3 . Another two-suited overcall system defining both suits explicitly is CRO (Colour, Rank, Other) which has similar advantages and disadvantages to Ghestem. It is also possible to use combinations of the bids that show all the two-suiters explicitly while allowing both majors to be bid at the two-level, such as RCO and SpoDo (Specific Michaels).http://mjbridge.info/overcaller/page58.html. Downloaded 30-Oct-2018. However, all methods explicitly showing both suits in all combinations lose a natural bid, usually the 3C overcall which can otherwise be useful as a weak or pre-emptive jump overcall.

Biography John Charles Thomas was born on September 6, 1891 in Meyersdale, Pennsylvania.Some sources use September 6, 1889. He was the son of a Methodist minister of Welsh descent while his mother, of German immigrant stock, had been an amateur singer. After studying initially for a medical career, Thomas won a scholarship to the Peabody Institute in Baltimore in 1910. He remained there for two years, receiving vocal tuition from Adelin Fermin. In 1912, Thomas left the Peabody and toured briefly with a musical troupe. He then went to live in Manhattan, New York City, where he performed with a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta company before being contracted by the Shubert brothers to perform in the show The Peasant Girl, which opened in March 1913. For the next nine years, he starred in a series of hit Broadway musicals including Her Soldier Boy, Maytime, Naughty Marietta, and Apple Blossoms (with Fred and Adele Astaire). =Operatic, recital and radio career= left Thomas sang in a concert performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's opera Sadko at Manhattan's Carnegie Hall in December 1924. His debut in a fully staged opera occurred in March 1925, as Amonasro in a production of Verdi's Aida, presented by the semi-professional Washington National Opera.McPherson, Jim, \\"Mr. Meek Goes to Washington: The Story of the Small-Potatoes Canadian Baritone Who Founded America's 'National' Opera\\", The Opera Quarterly, volume 20, no. 2, Spring 2004 Thomas was earning a great deal of money singing on Broadway but he wanted to gain more experience in opera. During the 1922-28 period, he spent part of each year in Europe, polishing his singing technique and appearing under contract at La Monnaie opera house in Brussels for the seasons of 1925-27. He would return to La Monnaie for 25 more performances in 1928, eight in 1930 and four in 1931. Even more importantly, he appeared with the famous Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin in productions of Faust at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, in July 1928. He continued to give recitals in the United States during this period and, in 1923, acted in a silent film, Under the Red Robe, directed by Alan Crosland. He made recordings, too, for the Vocalion label (1920‚Äì24) and Brunswick Records (1924‚Äì29), before signing with RCA Victor in 1931. Thomas also became a pioneer of radio broadcasts, in both New York and Florida. From 1929-32 he was a member of the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company, and in 1930 made one appearance with the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company. He accepted engagements with the Washington National, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia opera companies, and in 1934, to satisfy a public demand, he was signed by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. He would remain at the Met until 1943, performing opposite such stars as the soprano Rosa Ponselle. In the tough Great Depression years of the 1930s, he established himself as one of the most sought-after singers in America, with both a classical-music following and a considerable popular audience. His concerts normally offered selections from both repertoires: classical and operatic to begin, and American art songs and humorous \\"character\\" songs to close. He also appeared regularly on commercial radio programs. These included Five-Star Theater (in 1932-33 with the Joseph Bonime Orchestra), the Vince Radio Program (1934‚Äì36), the Ford, General Motors and The Magic Key of RCA shows (1937‚Äì40) and the Coca-Cola show (1940‚Äì41). In 1938, he helped Edwin Lester launch the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, appearing in the company's very first production in Blossom Time. This work was derived from a Viennese operetta Das Dreim√§derlhaus, with music arranged from that of Schubert and adapted for American audiences by Dorothy Donnelly and Sigmund Romberg. Thomas sang regularly in operettas with the LACLO until 1942, starring in productions of The Gypsy Baron, H.M.S. Pinafore, The Chocolate Soldier and Music in the Air. The Second World War made concert touring inconvenient, and very high taxes made it non-remunerative. Thomas was duly engaged to star on the Westinghouse Radio Program in 1943-46, accompanied by the Victor Young Orchestra. He probably reached his widest audience during this period, although his practice of performing songs exclusively in English has perhaps left him less well- remembered by today's musical \\"purists\\" than he should be. Nevertheless, many songs tailored for him to sing have gone on to become standards, such as the version of \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" by Albert Hay Malotte and the arrangement of \\"Home on the Range\\" by David W. Guion. Thomas was among the founders of the Music Academy of the West summer conservatory in 1947. From 1947 to 1948, Thomas undertook a long and demanding tour of Australia and New Zealand, where he played to crowded theatres. He retired bit by bit from the concert stage after 1950, and settled in Apple Valley, California in 1955 with his wife Dorothy. =Death= He died there in December 1960 from cancer. Owing to his high-spending lifestyle, the fortune that he had earned through singing was largely dissipated at the time of his death. His home in Apple Valley has been designated as one of the town's historic sites. Opposition to rock-and-roll music Thomas appeared twice as a contestant on the TV quiz program \\"You Bet Your Life\\", hosted by Groucho Marx. These episodes aired on 5 December 1957 and 12 December 1957. He was a strong vocal opponent of rock-and-roll music during the first appearance and debated the subject with advocate Roberta Rene during the second.You Bet Your Life #57-09 John Charles Thomas attacks Rock and Roll ('Room', Dec 5, 1957) - YouTubeYou Bet Your Life #57-10 Debating the merits of Rock & Roll (Secret word 'Grass', Dec 12, 1957) - YouTube Recordings John Charles Thomas left a large pool of audio recordings, many of which sold extremely well in their day and have been transferred in recent times to compact disc. Only a handful of these recordings, however, are devoted to opera arias. His operatic voice is probably best appreciated in commercial offerings such as \\"Nemico della patria\\" from Andrea Ch√©nier, and \\"C‚Äôen est fait‚Ä¶ Salom√© demande\\" from H√©rodiade. Live broadcast recordings of \\"Per me giunto\\" from Don Carlos, \\"Vien Leonora\\" from La favorite and \\"Il balen\\" from Il trovatore display his brilliant top notes and bel canto capabilities. He sang hymns, art songs, ballads, cowboy tunes, introspective German lieder, and shanties.  Voice Thomas belonged to a sequence of leading American operatic baritones whose overlapping careers stretched in an unbroken line from the 1920s through to the 1990s. They included Richard Bonelli, Lawrence Tibbett, Arthur Endr√®ze (who was based in Paris), Leonard Warren, Robert Merrill, Cornell MacNeil, Sherrill Milnes and Richard Fredricks. His lyric voice was more notable for its free top register than for its lower range. It was particularly suited to the French operatic repertoire, in which he was seldom heard in the United States apart from his Athanael in Massenet's Thais. It had remarkable flexibility, which was enhanced by Thomas's energy and expressiveness, particularly in his repertoire of popular material. In operatic work, however, this skill could be shown to good effect in trills and runs. Notable examples of his technical expertise are displayed his versions of \\"Il balen\\" from Il trovatore, and the \\"Drinking Song\\" from Hamlet. In common with a lot of singers of his inter-war generation, Thomas's voice was highly distinctive. In part, this may have been due to his early career on Broadway. He knew how to \\"sell\\" a song‚Äîto build a stirring aria to a climax that would bring audiences to their feet. While the voice was always unmistakably his, it changed noticeably in character over time. His early recordings display a darker tonal hue, and the voice is stiffer, as though he were imitating the stentorian Italian baritone of a previous generation, Titta Ruffo. By 1931, and certainly by 1934, he had found the more fluid, natural vocal style for which he is best remembered. From the late 1940s into the '50s, his vibrato began to widen, though it never became an unpardonable flaw in his singing technique, and the voice grew somewhat thicker and heavier in tone.

It is the first book of the tetralogy, followed by the books 1935 and Other Years (, 1989), Fear () and Dust and Ashes (). Principally told through the story of the fictional Sasha Pankratov, a sincere and loyal Komsomol member who is exiled as a result of party intrigues, the novel is semi-autobiographical - Rybakov too was exiled in the early 1930s. The book recounts the growing hysteria of the period where simple mistakes or humour were seen as examples of sabotage or acts of wreckers (cf The Joke by Milan Kundera). In effect the book exposes how, despite the honest intentions of Pankratov and older Bolsheviks like Kirov, Stalinism is destroying all their hopes. The novel is also notable for its portrayal of Joseph Stalin as a scheming and paranoid figure. The book, which was written between 1966 and 1983, was suppressedIntroduction to Children of the Arbat, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1988. until the Perestroika era (published for the first time as a feuilleton in 1987). It was a great publishing sensation of that era, being so direct in its criticism of the Soviet system, seemingly honest in its portrayal of Stalin and harsh in its cynical view of those who turned the Soviet Union into a \\"Great Power\\". The book was first published in English in 1988 by Dell Publishing, a division of Bantam Doubleday Dell.

It corresponds to the natural atoll of the same name. The administrative capital is located in Fonadhoo Island. Name Traditionally, Maldivians call this atoll simply 'Haddhunmathi', without adding the word 'Atholhu' at the end. Geography It is mostly rimmed by barrier reefs, the broadest of which are topped by islands. There are many islands along its eastern and southern boundaries. This atoll is quite regular excepting for the projection of the reef at its NE corner (Isdh≈´ Muli). It closely resembles Kolhumadulhu, its neighbour further north. Owing to its typical atoll shape, it differs in no respect from atolls in the Pacific Ocean, save for its greater size. Its reefs are generally of little breadth, with no signs of vilu (deep pools), except for its eastern fringes which are covered with islands that are quite large by Maldive standards. The lagoon is comparatively open, containing scattered shoal patches; the bottom is muddy and the average depth is from . Laamu Atoll forms the southern limit of Central Maldives. Beyond the Huvadhu Kandu, the broadest channel between atolls in the Maldives, lie the southern atolls. Kadhdhoo Domestic Airport is located on Kadhdhoo. Haddhunmathi Islands on the north eastern fringes of Laamu Atoll, or Haddhunmathi Atoll. The inhabited island of Ishoo as well as several uninhabited islands can be seen. Haddhunmathi (Satu Duvu) atoll was playing an important role in the Maldives when the nation was a Kingdom. Many of the islands located on Laamu's eastern reef have important archaeological sites, like Dhanbidhoo, Mundoo, Gan and Isdhoo. These are remains of monasteries, viharas and stupas of large proportions. Some of the most ancient writings of the Maldives are the Isdh≈´ L≈çmƒÅfƒÅnu and the Dhanbidh≈´ L≈çmƒÅfƒÅnu copperplates, relating to the conversion to Islam, the destruction of the Buddhist monuments, the beheading of the Buddhist monks and the building of mosques to replace the Buddhist temples and monasteries. These copperplates are from the year 1193 AD. The Maldivian king back then according to these documents was Sri Gadana Aditya Maharadun. A tentative transcription of the Dhanbid≈´ l≈çmafƒÅnu was made by M. Ibrahim Loutfi and was subsequently published in 'Faiyt≈´ra', the organ of the Maldivian Cultural Affairs Council. The temple compound at one of the Buddhist sites in Gan Island H. C. P. Bell excavated some of the Buddhist sites in 1923. The Stupa in Kuruhinna, one of the Buddhist sites in Gan Island, was remarkably well preserved. Only the Chattravali (Satihirutalu) was missing. Unfortunately these sites have been vandalized since then and there is almost nothing remaining now, except for a heap of stones and gravel. The cause of heavy destruction during recent years has been archaeological excavations on those sites themselves. Regrettably, these investigations were either done carelessly, or left the site unprotected after excavation. The removal of the sheltering jungle exposed the site to subsequent vandalism. Often local inhabitants plundered the place in the vain hope of finding gold or other treasures, as soon as the archaeologists and accompanying government officials left the island. The Dhanbidh≈´ L≈çmƒÅfƒÅnu tells us that the Satihirutalu (the chattravali or chattrayashti crowning a stupa) were broken to disfigure the numerous stupas. It tells us also that statues of Vairocana, the transcendent Buddha of the middle world region, were destroyed; and the destruction was not limited to sculptures. The wealth of manuscripts probably written on screwpine leaves that Maldivian monks in their Buddhist monasteries must have produced was either burnt or otherwise so thoroughly eliminated that it has disappeared without leaving any trace. Therefore, there are no samples of paintings from the Maldive Buddhist period itself. The only actual remains of the art of those times are a few sculptures and etchings on coral stone. Most of these are preserved in a little room in the Mal√© Museum, but many they are not properly labelled, so it is not easy to know where they come from. A Buddha head found by H.C.P. Bell during his excavations in this atoll has disappeared, but the picture taken by Bell can be seen in his Monograph.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom.

He is known from a chance mention in a Chinese biography of Mohammed, the T'ien-fang Chih-sheng shih-lu, written between 1721 and 1724 by Liu Chih. This work uses older materials that have been traced to a biography of the Prophet written by Sa'id al-Din Mohammed bin Mas'ud bin Mohammad al-Kazarumi, who died in 1357. According to this Chinese biography, the najashi of Ethiopia was said to have sent an ambassador with gifts to Mohammed's family upon sighting a star that announced his birth. When Mohammed became seven years old, Saifu, described as the najashi's grandson, likewise sent gifts. This source also adds that Saifu was the grandfather of the najashi who gave shelter to the Muslim emigrants around 615-6 at Axum. In reporting the contents of this \\"very tentative\\" source, Munro-Hay speculates how this genealogical relationship around Saifu might fit the known series of rulers in the later 6th century (identifying Saifu's grandfather with Kaleb, and his grandson with Sahama), and appears to admit that these details are plausible.S.

He was the country's first cricketing captain to achieve victory, both at home against the West Indies in 1956, and the first away win, against South Africa in 1962.  Early life  Reid was born in Auckland in 1928 to Iris and Norman Reid. His father, Norman, was a Scottish-born rugby league player, while his mother, Iris, was a music teacher. The family moved to Wellington when Reid was young. He studied at the Hutt Valley High School, where he started out as a rugby union player but later switched to cricket, stemming from heart problems and bouts of rheumatic fever. Playing career Reid started out as a strong and aggressive bowler who, in his early days, was an authentic quick. He later turned to off-cutters and spin from a short run-up with a trademark side-step. Until a swollen knee slowed down his movements and checked his agility, he was a strong and multi- talented fieldsman at slip and in the covers. On the 1949 tour of England he was the reserve wicketkeeper, keeping wicket in several matches including the final Test.Wisden 1950, p. 209. \\"The figures mislead\\", said John Mehaffey, whose favourite Reid was. \\"Nobody who saw him at the crease would dispute his own assessment that he could have increased his batting average by half again if he had played in the 1980s side with Richard Hadlee and Martin Crowe.\\" Reid was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1959. Reid never featured in an England-beating New Zealand Test side, but his men secured a narrow first- innings lead against Dexter's eleven in the Third Test in Christchurch in 1963. Unable to take advantage, they collapsed at the hands of Fred Trueman and Fred Titmus for 159 in their second innings, of which Reid hit exactly 100 before stumbling from the field in pallid enervation. The second-highest score was 22. This remains the lowest all-out Test match total to include a century.  Post playing-career  Post retirement, in 1969, Reid played in what is thought to be the first cricket match at the South Pole, with the striped barber's-type pole with a silver reflecting glass ball on top representing the actual Pole acting as the wicket.Martin-Jenkins, pp. 39‚Äì40. The match ended when Reid hit a six and the ball was unable to be found in the snow of the outfield.Martin-Jenkins, p. 39. It has been noted that every shot he played, no matter where he hit it, travelled north.Martin-Jenkins, p. 40. He served New Zealand Cricket as a national selector from 1975 to 1978. In 1981, he moved to South Africa to be a coach. He had earlier noted that the sporting boycott of South Africa during its apartheid era was 'ill-conceived'. He served as an International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee from 1993 through 2002, serving 50 Tests and 98 One Day International matches. As a match referee he was known for his tough actions. He had suspended Pakistan fast bowler, Waqar Younis, and had fined Azhar Mahmood for ball tampering. He had also acted on complaints on fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar's bowling action. In 2003, he was appointed as the president of New Zealand Cricket. On the death of Trevor Barber on 7 August 2015, Reid became the oldest surviving New Zealand Test cricketer. Reid was also involved in popularising squash in New Zealand. He set up the John Reid Squash centre in Wellington, which was subsequently sold off to the New Zealand Squash Rackets Association.  Personal life  Reid married Norli Le Fevre in 1951; he had met her earlier at age 18 while she was working as a nurse at the hospital where he was being treated for rheumatic fever. The couple had one son, Richard, and two daughters, Alison and Ann. Richard played nine one-day internationals for New Zealand. Reid died in Auckland on 14 October 2020. Honours In the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, Reid was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to sport, especially cricket. He was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, also for services to cricket, in the 2014 New Year Honours. Publications Reid wrote two books, Sword of Willow (1962) and A Million Miles of Cricket (1966). Joseph Romanos wrote the biography John Reid: A Cricketing Life in 2000.

Career  Trojanowska first appeared in a short-running 1979 TV series Strachy and subsequently played the title role in the feature film Carmilla. She rose to fame in 1980 with the hits \\"Tyle samo prawd ile k≈Çamstw\\" and \\"Wszystko czego dzi≈õ chcƒô\\", the latter performed to a big success at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, accompanied by the popular Polish rock band Budka Suflera. Trojanowska immediately became one of the most popular singers of the early 1980s in Poland. Romuald Lipko, Budka Suflera's leader, composed eight tracks for her debut album, simply entitled Iza and released in 1981. The same year Trojanowska teamed up with another rock band, Stalowy Baga≈º, with whom she recorded an EP and performed at the Opole Festival. Their performance drew controversies as the singer was wearing a red tie on stage, typical for the outfit of the members of Union of Polish Youth. The organisation accused her of profaning the Union. In the meantime, Trojanowska appeared in several Polish feature films and TV series. By the early 1982, Izabela finished recording her second LP, Uk≈Çady. The album showcased rockier sound and spawned hits \\"Brylanty\\" and \\"Karmazynowa noc\\". Later that year, she paired with Tadeusz Nalepa for the album Po≈ºegnalny cyrk, whose politically charged lyrics strongly criticized martial law in Poland. That record was however withdrawn by censorship office. At that time, Trojanowska was criticized by both Solidarity and the communist government, and decided to emigrate from the country. Together with her husband, she moved to the Netherlands, the USA, the United Kingdom, before finally settling for Germany. She released two English language singles in the mid-1980s, but they turned out unsuccessful. In 1990, Trojanowska released a self-titled, English language album, which was a commercial failure, spawning only a minor radio hit \\"Independence Day\\". In 1991, her first retrospective was released, consisting only of the early 1980s material, followed by the release of the shelved album Po≈ºegnalny cyrk in 1993. Her next studio album was Chcƒô inaczej, released in 1996 to warmer reception. It spawned a minor radio hit single \\"I sta≈Ço siƒô\\". In 1997, she accepted the role of Monika Ross-Nawrot in the hit soap opera Klan. 2006 saw the release of another compilation, which included five re-recordings of old hits. She teamed up with Polish band Mafia and started to work on new material. Her first studio album in 15 years, ≈ªycia zawsze ma≈Ço, was released in 2011 to minor success.

Adam Joseph Shea (1872‚Äì1946), a Wesleyan Methodist Church‚Äînow Wesleyan Church‚Äîminister, and his wife, Maude Mary Theodora (Whitney) SheaShea, George Beverly, \\"How Sweet the Sound\\", Tyndale House Publishers, 2004, p. 161 () (1881‚Äì1971). =Church background= The Shea family served at the Wesleyan Methodist church in Winchester, Ontario, Canada; Houghton, New York (1917‚Äì1921); the Sunnyside Wesleyan Methodist church in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, from 1921;\\"A Brief History of Our Church\\"; at the Willett Memorial Wesleyan Methodist Church at Midler Avenue, Syracuse, New York; and the Jersey City, New Jersey Wesleyan Methodist church during his youth. =Spiritual background= Shea himself has said that he became a Christian at the age of five or six, but made a re-dedication to Christ when he was 18: > [T]here were times when I needed to rededicate my life to the Lord Jesus. > When I was 18, my dad was pastoring a church in Ottawa, and I was feeling > not too spiritual. The church was having a \\"special effort,\\" as they called > it, for a week. I remember that on Friday night Dad came down from the > pulpit and tenderly placed his hand on my shoulder. He whispered, \\"I think > tonight might be the night, son, when you come back to the Lord.\\" Whatever > Dad did or said, I listened to him and respected him. And, yes, that was the > night! Shea rededicated himself to Christ at the Sunnyside Wesleyan Methodist Church in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. =Musical background= Shea was taught to play the violin by his father, and the piano and organ by his mother. Shea's bass- baritone voice brought early recognition and provided many opportunities for him to sing in his father's church. He began singing at religious meetings in the Ottawa Valley. =Education= Shea attended Annesley College in Ottawa, before transferring in 1928 to Houghton College (Houghton, New York), where he studied singing with Herman Baker. While studying at Houghton College, Shea sang with the Houghton College Glee Club. Financial difficulties made it necessary for him to terminate his studies in 1929. =Medical employment= After leaving college, Shea became a clerk in the medical department in the New York City offices of the Mutual of New York Life Insurance Company, where he worked for the next nine years. =Marriages and children= Shea married his childhood sweetheart, Erma L. Scharfe (1908‚Äì1976) on 16 June 1934.\\"Shea, George Beverly.\\" Century of Country; . Retrieved 3 February 2009. Shea and Erma had two children: Ronnie and Elaine.

He was buried on the grounds of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina. A reed organ owned by Shea now belongs to Art Robinson.\\"The Grandfather Of Alt-Science: Art Robinson has seeded scientific skepticism within the GOP for decades. Now he wants to use urine to save lives\\" by Daniel Engber on FiveThirtyEight. Oct. 12, 2017 Accessed Oct. 15, 2017. Ministry=New York (1929‚Äì1939)= As a result of the recommendation of American opera baritone John Charles Thomas (born 6 September 1891 ‚Äì died 13 December 1960), Shea studied singing under Gino Monaco, Thomas's own vocal coach. While working for Mutual Life in New York City Shea appeared on an amateur hour program hosted by Fred Allen on NBC radio. Despite losing to a yodeler, Shea earned second place, and a spot singing popular music on Allen's program, probably a precursor to Allen's Town Hall Tonight. Although Shea \\"impressed the critics and scores of fans\\", he still didn't feel he had discovered a direction for his life.Ace Collins, Turn Your Radio on: The Stories Behind Gospel Music's All-Time Greatest Songs (Zondervan, 1999):104. In 1933 a network radio director heard Shea sing and arranged an audition to sing popular secular songs for Your Hit Parade, a national program with the Lyn Murray Singers broadcast on the NBC network. Shea passed the audition and was offered a job, but reluctantly turned the position down because he didn't feel right about performing secular music. Shea sang regularly on radio station WHN, and on Erling C. Olsen's Meditations in the Psalms broadcast on radio station WMCA, as well as doing 30-minute programs from 7-7:30 am on WKBO in Jersey City, New Jersey. Shea also appeared on WKBO's \\"the Old Fashioned Gospel Hour.\\" Shea sang on the Young Person's Church of the Air radio program, which had been started by Percy Crawford (1902‚Äì60)\\"Papers of Percy Bartimus Crawford and Ruth Crawford Porter, Collection 357\\" at Archives, Billy Graham Center, Wheaton, Illinois in Philadelphia in 1931 on Radio station WIP.Joel A. Carpenter, Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism (Oxford University Press, 1997):164.\\"Papers of Percy Bartimus Crawford and Ruth Crawford Porter - Collection 357\\" at Archives, Billy Graham Center, Wheaton, Illinois Shea began his recording career at the U.S. branch of Decca Records after being signed by A & R representative Jack Kapp, who told Shea: \\"If you do better than the singer we have in mind, we will give you a contract. If not, you'll have to take the records on yourself. Shea recorded \\"Jesus Whispers Peace,\\" \\"Lead Me Gently Home, Father,\\" \\"I'd Rather Have Jesus,\\" and \\"God Understands,\\" accompanied by Ruth Crawford (wife of Percy Crawford) on the organ. About 7,000 copies were sold, and they are prized by music lovers today, the majority being Protestant Christians like Shea. =Chicago (1939‚Äì1952)= In 1939 Shea auditioned unsuccessfully for a spot on a CBS radio program that originated in Chicago, Illinois. WMBI (1939‚Äì1944) Soon after Dr. Will Houghton, president of the Moody Bible Institute (MBI) offered Shea a staff position with \\"duties that included emceeing, interviewing, news-casting, continuity writing, programming, administration, auditioning, and singing\\"Cusic, 182-183. on radio station WMBI, \\"the powerhouse of evangelical radio\\",Joel A. Carpenter, Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism (Oxford University Press, 1997):135. the first non-commercial Christian radio station in America, which was owned and operated by the Moody Bible Institute originally on its campus in Chicago. Initially Shea sang on Houghton's Let's Go Back to the Bible, from 1939.Cusic, 183. Later he was also involved in Miracles and Melodies, which started on 67 radio stations across the USA in 1940, and was broadcast on 187 different stations in 45 US states, Canada, Latin America and China; and in Hymns From the Chapel each morning at 8:15. Songs in the Night (1944‚Äì1952) On 2 January 1944 Shea began his ministry as a featured soloist on Billy Graham's Songs in the Night weekly radio program,Jacob Climo and Maria G. Cattell, Social Memory and History: Anthropological Perspectives,\\" 2nd ed. (Rowman Altamira, 2002):23. which was broadcast live on Sunday evenings for 45 minutes from 10.15pmLewis Drummond and Betty Drummond, Women of Awakenings: The Historic Contribution of Women to Revival Movements (Kregel Publications, 1996):337. from the basement of the Village (Baptist) Church at 4475 Wolf Road, Western Springs, Illinois,Betsy J. Green, Western Springs, Illinois (Arcadia Publishing, 2002):98-99. pastored by Graham,Sandra Donovan, Billy Graham (Twenty-First Century Books, 2006):39. and transmitted on radio station WCFL originating from Chicago, Illinois. The popularity of Shea helped make the previously financially struggling program self-sustaining within weeks.Deborah Hart Strober and Gerald S. Strober, A Day in the Life of Billy Graham: Living the Message (Square One Publishers, 2003):27. The Drummonds indicate that Shea \\"skyrocketed the broadcast into a great success,\\" so that soon Songs in the Night was broadcast twice on Sundays. After eight years Shea turned over his duties on this program to Glenn Jorian so that he could devote his energies full-time to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) .Cusic, 166. Club Time (1944‚Äì1952) In June 1944 Shea resigned from WMBI to sing gospel on a 15-minute weekday radio program, Club Time, the second oldest hymn program on commercial radio. Club Time, initially broadcast on Radio station WCFL, was sponsored by Herbert J. Taylor (18 April 1893 ‚Äì 1 May 1978), a Christian businessman who headed Club Aluminum of Chicago. According to Cusic: > Shea's job was to host the program and sing several songs, including the > favorite hymn of various famous people. It was on \\"Club Time\\" that Beverly > Shea became George Beverly Shea at the insistence of the advertising agency; > it seems they felt most listeners were confused by a man named \\"Beverly.\\" Club Time was broadcast nationally from September 1945 for the next seven years over the ABC Radio and Armed Forces Networks and many independent stations. This show brought Shea national recognition, and by 1951 Shea was the most prominent male soloist in gospel music.Don Cusic, The Sound of Light: A History of Gospel Music (Popular Press of the University of Wisconsin, 1990):135. Singspiration (1947) By the summer of 1947 Shea was signed to the Singspiration Sacred Recordings label,James E. Ruark, The House of Zondervan: Celebrating 75 Years,\\" rev. ed. (Zondervan, 2006):100-101. which had been founded by Dr. Alfred B. Smith (8 November 1916 ‚Äì 9 August 2001) in 1941, where he sang on a number of 78 rpm albums, including Bass Baritone (Singspiration \\"Treasure Chest Series\\" LP S-100) and Lead Me Gently Home, Father (Singspiration LP 156). =Evangelistic meetings (1942‚Äì1947)= Summer of 1942 In the summer of 1942 Shea took a leave of absence from WMBI to join Word Of Life (WOL) evangelist Jack Wyrtzen for evangelistic crusades in the New York area. He spent this summer traveling throughout New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, singing at youth rallies while also singing on WHN on Sunday mornings. Youth for Christ (1942) When Shea returned to Chicago in September 1942, he talked with Torrey Johnson about conducting youth meetings in that area and soon \\"Chicagoland Youth For Christ\\" was held in Orchestra Hall on Michigan Avenue, Chicago, with Shea singing and Billy Graham speaking. From this initial concert, Johnson founded Youth for Christ (YFC). Shea sang in YFC rallies across the U.S. and Canada. =Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (1947 to 2013)= According to Don Cusic, \\"Shea and Billy Graham are the prime examples of an evangelical Christianity with mainstream appeal after World War II. Previously the evangelicals and fundamentalists were on the fringes of American religion; Shea and Graham put it in the mainstream.\\"Cusic, 181. According to David Poling, \\"central to Billy's successful ministry are the years of loyal service of people like George Beverly Shea, the first staff member to be hired by Graham back in the Chicago radio days.\\"David Poling, Why Billy Graham? (Sunstone Press, 2007):143. Shea has been involved as a soloist with Billy Graham and his ministry since 1947. Shea first met Billy Graham in 1940 while Graham was pastor of the Village Church in Western Springs, Illinois. In a September 2007 interview Shea recalled how he first met Billy Graham: > One morning, there was a rap on my office door. I looked out and there was a > tall young man with blond hair and we shook hands. He was 21 and I was 31. > It was Billy Graham and he had traveled in from Wheaton College on a train > just to say 'hello.' He said he listened to my morning hymn show called > 'Hymns From The Chapel.' That's how we first got acquainted. I came into > this work with Mr. Graham in 1947 after we had exchanged letters and talked > on the phone. He said he wanted me to be his gospel singer. I thanked him > but told him the only gospel singers I've ever heard about would sing a > verse or two and stop and talk a while. 'Would I have to do that?' I asked > him. He chuckled and said, 'I hope not.' With that, I said, 'Well, I'd like > to come with you.' That was in November of 1947 and I've been with him ever > since. In 1948 Shea, along with Graham, Barrows and Grady Wilson, formulated a set of ethical guidelines, later designated The Modesto Manifesto, that became the cornerstone of the BGEA.Terry Whalin, Billy Graham: America's Greatest Evangelist (W. Terry Whalin, 2002):63. Shea, along with Graham, Barrows, Grady Wilson and George Wilson, is one of the five directors of the BGEA.Terry Whalin, Billy Graham: America's Greatest Evangelist (W. Terry Whalin, 2002):81. Billy Graham Crusades Shea sang at the unofficial launching of Graham's crusades in the old Armory in Charlotte, North Carolina, in November 1947. His first song was \\"I Will Sing the Wondrous Story.\\" In the early days of his association with Graham, Shea earned a wage for each meeting.Donovan, 46. Since the beginning of Graham's crusade ministry Shea and Cliff Barrows have been the nucleus of the crusade musical team. Barrows is choir director, platform emcee and radio-television program director. They were joined in 1950 by pianist Tedd Smith, and through the years organists Don Hustad and John Innes have provided additional accompaniment.For the Crusade at Harringay, London, UK in 1952(?) the organist was Paul Mickelson.BGEA: Media Relations As the musical mainstay in Graham's crusades, Shea is often called \\"America's beloved Gospel singer.\\" In each crusade Shea \\"brings a quiet solo immediately preceding ... Graham's message. His solo serves as a transition from the song service into the message.\\"R. Alan Streett, The Effective Invitation: A Practical Guide for the Pastor.\\" 3rd ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel, 2004):197. Collins indicates: \\"Shea's solos set the tone for the preacher's messages. With his full, rich baritone Shea not only charmed audiences, he also touched them with the message of each song he chose.\\"Collins, Radio, 106. Graham said that Shea always prepared his crowds by singing before the message, and he felt the song was more powerful than the sermon.Keith Johnson, I Know Where I've Been. I'm Just Not Sure Where I'm Going (Xulon Press, 2003):60. According to Billy Graham in a 2002 interview in The Ottawa Citizen,\\" > I've been listening to Bev Shea sing for more than 50 years, and I would > still rather hear him sing than anyone else I know.Billy Graham, quoted in > The Ottawa Citizen (19 July 2002); in Ask Billy Graham: The World's Best- > Loved Preacher Answers Your Most Important Questions, comp. Bill Adler > (Thomas Nelson, 2007):62. Shea himself indicated the importance of his solo: \\"Billy looks forward to the solo before the message as a time for people to quiet down and for him to gather strength.\\" Shea also made a valuable contribution to the increased effectiveness of Graham's crusades. According to R. Alan Streett: > For a number of years the entire congregation sang the invitational hymn, > until Bev Shea suggested that the choir alone handle the assignment. Shea > remembered how he, as an eighteen-year-old lad, was convicted by the Spirit > as a choir sang \\"Just As I Am.\\" He felt the effects of a soft choir number > could be used by God to touch people's hearts.R. Alan Streett, The Effective > Invitation: A Practical Guide for the Pastor.\\" 3rd ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: > Kregel, 2004):196. One day Shea suggested to Graham: > Have you ever thought of saying, \\"As the choir sings, you come\\"? With just > the choir singing there might be more contemplation upon the Holy Spirit's > call. Soon after that, for the first time in his growing ministry, he began > to say at the close of every service, \\"As the choir sings, you come!\\" ;Hour of Decision (1950) The Hour of Decision radio program was produced in the recording studio of Arthur \\"Guitar Boogie\\" Smith in Charlotte, North Carolina. On 5 December 1950 the Hour of Decision radio broadcasts began in Atlanta, Georgia on 150 radio stations. By its fifth week Hour of Decision had the largest audience of any religious radio program in history. By 1952 Shea sang regularly on this program. Because of Shea's weekly singing on the Hour of Decision radio broadcast since 1950 and his numerous personal appearances, his voice is recognized now in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, South America, and throughout North America. =Recording career (1951 to 2013)= Shea has recorded approximately 500 vocal solos on more than seventy albums (including nine compact discs) of religious music on both the RCA Victor and Word Records labels. Shea has recorded songs with orchestral accompaniment, as arranged and conducted by musical directors, such as Hugo Winterhalter, Ralph Carmichael, Bill Walker, Nathan Scott, Norman Leyden, Jimmy Owens, Kurt Kaiser, Danny Davis, Charles Grean, and Radio City Music Hall organist, Ray Bohr. His albums have been produced by RCA Victor's Steve Sholes, Brad McCuen, Darol Rice, Cliff Barrows, Don Hustad, Bill Fasig, and John Innes. RCA Victor and Word In 1951, Shea was signed to RCA Victor Records by Sam Wallace and Elmer Eades, after being \\"discovered\\" by Paul Barkmeyer. His first album for RCA Victor, released on 10-inch and 12-inch long-playing records and on 45 RPM records, was entitled Inspirational Songs, produced by Stephen H. Sholes (12 February 1911 ‚Äì 22 April 1968) and backed by Hugo Winterhalter and his Orchestra. During Shea's first four years with RCA Victor, his records did not recover the cost of recording and pressing, but by the end of the 1950s, he enjoyed major success. After a 24-year association with the label, he left it in favor of Word Records in 1975. Notable songs Shea is best known for his rendition of \\"How Great Thou Art,\\" the English translation by Rev. Stuart K. Hine of the Swedish song \\"O Store Gud,\\" written in 1886 by Rev. Carl Boberg (1859‚Äì1940). Arguably Shea's most popular hymn is \\"The Wonder of It All,\\" the title of which was also used by the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television for their 1998 production of his life story. =Composing= *\\"I'd Rather Have Jesus\\" (1932) In 1932 Shea composed the tune to \\"I'd Rather Have Jesus,\\" the words of which were written by Rhea F. Miller (1894‚Äì1966),Kenneth W. Osbeck, 101 More Hymn Stories: The Inspiring True Stories Behind 101 Favorite Hymns (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel, 1985):138. the wife of Dr. Howard Miller, later a general superintendent of the Church of the Nazarene. When RCA Victor signed Shea to a recording contract, \\"the song that the company chose to initially spotlight their new singer was \\"I'd Rather Have Jesus.\\" *\\"The Wonder of It All\\" (1955) Shea also wrote both the lyrics and music for \\"The Wonder of It All,\\" which was copyrighted originally by Chancel Music in 1956.Let There be Praise!(Review and Herald, 1988): Hymn 53 =Writing= Shea authored a number of books including an autobiography, Then Sings My Soul (1968); Songs That Lift the Heart (1972); How Sweet the Sound (2004); and Stories Behind 50 Southern Gospel Favorites, Vol. 2 (2005). =Television appearances= *Hour of Decision (1951‚Äì54): Billy Graham's television program that was broadcast for three years from 1951 in primetime on Sunday evenings on the ABC television networkWilliam Martin, \\"Billy Graham Crusades\\" in Encyclopedia of Television, ed.

It was created on February 8, 1962 when Huvadhu Atoll was divided into two districts. Gaafu Dhaalu corresponds to the Southwestern section of this large natural atoll, south of the line extending between the channels of Footukandu and Vaarulu Kandu. The capital of this region was Vaadhoo but it has been changed to Thinadhoo (formerly known as Thenadhoo). There are 153 islands in this district, 10 of which are inhabited. This district is located about 340 kilometres south of the capital Mal√©. NOTE: Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Shaviyani, Noonu, Raa, Baa, Kaafu, etc. (including Gaafu Dhaalu) are code letters assigned to the present administrative divisions of the Maldives. They are not the proper names of the natural atolls that make up these divisions. Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls. The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll).Tim Godfrey, Atlas of the Maldives, Atoll Editions 2004 History Historically the Huvadu atoll chief had a great measure of self-government. He even had the privilege, not granted to any other atoll chief of the Maldives, to fly his own flag in his vessels and at his residence. In January 1959, the three southern atolls: Huvadhu, Fuvahmulah and Addu, were involved in setting up the breakaway United Suvadive Republic which survived until September 1963. The name of the secessionist state was taken from the ancient name of this atoll. In some islands, like Gaddh≈´, there was opposition to the secession, and by means of threats and arson, the groups of people opposing the Suvadive state were forced to agree. Havaru Thinadhoo was burnt down by soldiers sent by then Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir from Mal√© during the secession in 1962, after which it was left uninhabited for four whole years. The Kaadedhdhoo Domestic Airport, located on the formerly uninhabited island of Kaadedhdhoo was opened in 1993. In 2006 the Tourism Ministry of Maldives released the island of Vatavarrehaa for tourist resort development. A 150 bed resort is planned, this is the first resort to be built in Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll. Archaeology There are important Buddhist Archaeological remains in the Islands of Fiyoaree, Gan, VƒÅd≈´ and others. These ruins consist mainly of large ruined stupas.

He is primarily known through the coins that were minted during his reign.A letter to Antoine d'Abbadie, dated 8 January 1869, mentions a coin of this ruler. It has been suggested that it was either he or more probably his father who gave shelter to the Muslim emigrants around 615‚Äì616 at Axum.  Accounts  Confirmed Muslim sources indicate that the Islamic prophet Muhammad prayed an absentee funeral prayer () in Madinah which is performed upon a dead Muslim if they die in a place with no Muslims to pray for the dead. This is one of the justifications provided by Muslims that Al-Najashi died as a Muslim. https://sunnah.com/search/?q=negus Scholar of ancient Ethiopia, Stuart Munro- Hay (1947‚Äì2004), stated that either Armah or Gersem was the last Axumite king to issue coins. Bronze coins from the reign of Armah depict him as a full- length figure enthroned, with Christian cross motifs throughout.  Artifacts  Armah's silver coins have an unusual reverse, showing a structure with three crosses, the middle one gilded. Munro-Hay quotes W.R.O.

It was released in early 1976, following a four-year hiatus from the music industry during which time she both married and divorced, and lived away from the spotlight. She dedicated the album to her mother. The music of Smile is smooth jazz-pop, and Nyro was reunited with producer and arranger Charlie Calello, who had worked with Nyro on her 1968 opus Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. Musically, Smile finds Nyro exploring Chinese culture with traditional Asian instrumentation and lyric allusions, particularly on the mildly controversial \\"Children of the Junks\\". Elsewhere, she rails against the music industry (\\"Money\\") and sings of her new laidback lifestyle away from the glare of the media. Despite her long absence, Columbia Records had re-signed Nyro and the album became a small chart success during 1976, peaking at #60 on the Billboard 200, then known as the Pop Albums chart. It produced her first full-band tour in 1976, which was documented the following year on the live album Season of Lights. Overview After Nyro's huge burst of creativity between 1966 and 1971, when she recorded five well-received albums and well over 40 original songs, she retreated from the limelight, partly stung by her lack of major commercial success in her own right but also because of the lure of love. Nyro married Vietnam War veteran David Bianchini in 1972 after a whirlwind romance and spent the next three years living with him in a small town in Massachusetts. The marriage ended after three years, during which time she grew accustomed to the country life as opposed to the city life where she had recorded her first five records. In 1975, Nyro split from Bianchini and also suffered the trauma of the death of her mother Gilda to ovarian cancer at the age of 49; Laura herself died from the same disease at the same age two decades later. She consoled herself largely by recording a new album, enlisting Charlie Calello, with whom she had collaborated on Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. Musically, Smile begins the \\"mellow period\\" that Nyro stayed with on her studio albums for the rest of her career, although it continues her fascination with mysticism with various exotic instruments and arrangements. The title track, particularly, explores a deep flirtation with Japanese music. Several of the tracks, including \\"Children of the Junks\\" and \\"I Am The Blues\\" had been written and sung by Nyro in concert as early as 1971 and 1972 (as evidenced by bootleg recordings) and were later recorded for this album.

He played professionally for the Tampa Bay Rays and the San Diego Padres. He last pitched in the major leagues in 2006. Early life Brazelton was born in Tullahoma, Tennessee and graduated from Tullahoma High School in Tullahoma. While pitching in high school, Brazelton had knee surgery in 1995, then Tommy John surgery in 1996. He played college baseball at Middle Tennessee State University. In 1999, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Professional career The Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected him with the third overall draft pick in the first round of the 2001 MLB amateur draft, and Brazelton made his MLB debut September 13, 2002. In 2004, Brazelton, after being called the second coming of Roger Clemens by Peter Gammons, received the Tony Conigliaro Award. After Stuart Sternberg took over as principal owner of the Devil Rays, Brazelton was traded during the 2005 annual baseball winter meetings to the Padres for third baseman Sean Burroughs. In spring training of 2006, Brazelton appeared impressive, going 1‚Äì0 with a 1.77 ERA in 5 starts and earned the position of fourth starter in the Padres's four-man rotation, behind Jake Peavy, Chris Young, and Shawn Estes. However, Brazelton's first two starts were disastrous, taking the loss for both while pitching a combined 6 innings and giving up 17 hits and 17 earned runs. Brazelton was then moved to the bullpen and used as a spot reliever where between March 8 and April 19, he pitched 11.1 innings with a 2.31 ERA. However, on May 11 against the Milwaukee Brewers, Brazelton came in relief of Jake Peavy in the 8th inning with an 8‚Äì0 lead and gave up 4 runs on 3 hits and a walk without recording an out. Brazelton was promptly demoted to the Padres' AAA affiliate the following day and has not pitched in the major leagues since. On December 4, 2006, the Kansas City Royals signed Brazelton to a minor league contract, only to be released from their Triple-A Omaha affiliate on April 27, 2007. On June 2, 2007, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Brazelton to a minor league contract and assigned him to their Double-A affiliate, the Altoona Curve. After becoming a free agent, following the conclusion of the 2007 season, the St. Louis Cardinals signed Brazelton to a minor league contract, but he was released during spring training. Brazelton signed with the Camden Riversharks on April 4, 2009. On April 13, the Kansas City T-Bones of the Northern League signed Brazelton to a contract for the 2010 season. He pitched in just two games for them before being granted free agency.

He helped pioneer the remix and 12\\" single in America, and was among the most influential New York DJs of the 1970s. Career Gibbons began DJing in New York in the early 1970s, and was among the first Americans to incorporate techniques from dub reggae production into dance music. In 1975 he began DJing at the Manhattan club Galaxy 21 in 1975; he would become a regular at the club. He left Galaxy 21 in late 1976 after he discovered his sets were being secretly recorded and sold on the black market. Unable to find a new regular club that would accept his sound, he briefly moved to Seattle before returning to New York and DJing haphazardly. He also enjoyed a long association with Salsoul Records at the end of the 1970s. His DJ skills, punctuality and seriousness convinced Salsoul to assign him the remix of \\"Ten Percent\\", by Double Exposure, even though he had never produced. It became the first commercially available 12-inch single in the world, and his best-known remix. His remix of \\"Hit and Run\\" by Loleatta Holloway was a surprise hit. He released Salsoul mixes such as Disco Boogie: Super Hits for Non-Stop Dancing (1976) and Disco Madness (1979), the latter being the first full-length release by a solo remixer. He also worked on labels such as West End and Gold Mind. Gibbons was largely inactive in the early 1980s, but returned in 1984 with his biggest hit, a mix of Strafe's \\"Set It Off\\", which became an anthem of the early New York garage scene. In 1986 he released a remix of Arthur Russell's \\"Schoolbell/Tree House\\" for Sleeping Bag Records. Gibbons became a reborn Christian in the 1980s, but still managed to turn out cutting edge mixes during this period (he simply focused on songs and lyrics that did not offend his beliefs). Despite becoming isolated from the New York dance scene and some of his friends, he was warmly received after he embarked on a small tour of Japan in 1993. He spent his final weeks living alone in a YMCA, and died of AIDS-related symptoms in 1994. His remixes were posthumously compiled on the triple-CD compilation Mixed with Love (2004) and the 2-CD Jungle Music (2010). The first feature Gibbons' Salsoul mixes of tracks by the likes of Loleatta Holloway, The Salsoul Orchestra, Double Exposure, First Choice, Love Committee and Anthony White among others. Jungle Music compiles a wider scope of his work. Style and influence Gibbons, along with hip hop pioneer Kool DJ Herc, was among the first American musicians to apply elements of Jamaican dub production to disco and dance music. Like Arthur Russell, who recorded with him, Gibbons \\"used dub as a dislocating device, preventing disco's simple groove from developing under the dancers' feet.\\" His mixes focused more on percussion than melody, and \\"stretched out the grooves so much that they teetered on the edge of motionlessness.\\" He was also among the first to beat-juggle between two copies of the same record. According to AllMusic, \\"utterly transformed with the addition of echo/reverb effects borrowed from dub and drum breaks, [his] singles influenced dozens of producers (and DJs).\\" Gibbons was known as \\"the DJ's DJ\\" because his peers would go out of their way to hear him play. Gibbons was an important part of the early 1970s New York City disco underground scene, influencing garage and house music DJs like Frankie Knuckles and Larry Levan. He also laid the foundations for early 1980s experimental Chicago house music. One of the early pioneers of beat-mixing, and known for considerably more skillful mixing than many better-known DJs at the time, he is cited by many early pioneers of the house-music scene as an influence. His \\"Disco Blend\\" remix of Double Exposure's \\"Ten Percent\\" was once described by UK DJ Ashley Beedle as providing a \\"blueprint for house music\\". The 1996 album Walter's Room was Black Science Orchestra's homage to Gibbons, released in London on Junior Boy's Own Records.

He has also been a recipient of the Scottish Grocery Lifetime Achievement Award.  In football  Tributes to Eddie Thompson at Tannadice Park after his death. Thompson was initially a Motherwell fan, but changed his allegiances and became a supporter of Dundee United when he moved to the Dundee area. He had a lengthy association with the club, and instigated their first ever shirt sponsorship deal, with VG, in the 1980s. He was appointed the club's honorary business consultant but subsequently became estranged from the club's management after falling out with manager and chairman Jim McLean. Thompson spent many years trying to invest in the club, being constantly rebuffed until finally assuming control of Dundee United in September 2002 when he bought McLean's shareholding. After gaining control he invested large sums of money in the team, but initially with limited success. Thompson gained a reputation as a ruthless chairman, sacking five managers in little more than his first four years in charge. He continued to take charge of club affairs personally, despite having been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2003. Thompson also served as a member of the Scottish Premier League management board. The club's fortunes began to improve following the appointment of Craig Levein, who would become a personal friend of Thompson, as manager in October 2006. During the 2007-08 season, Dundee United reached the Scottish League Cup Final, by which time it had become public knowledge that the chairman was terminally ill. Many supporters wore T-shirts bearing a \\"One Eddie Thompson\\" slogan during the final against Rangers to pay tribute to his efforts on behalf of the club. Also during March 2008, it was announced that the East Stand at United's Tannadice Park stadium was to be renamed after Thompson, following suggestions by supporters. During this period, Thompson reorganised the club to ensure continuity following his death. His son Stephen, already a director, was appointed as chief executive, taking over many of his father's duties.

It also features a variety of non-native species, including an extensive Rose Garden. It is classified as a Garden of National Significance by the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture. The Wellington Cable Car runs between Lambton Quay and the top of the Botanic Garden, and it is the most direct way to get from the top part of the garden to Wellington's Central Business District. The winding hill paths of the Garden are a popular spot for Wellington residents. It is used for walking, jogging and taking children to the playground, and tourists enjoy meandering through the Garden's many collections via the downhill path to the city. The Gardens feature a large Victorian-style glasshouse, the Begonia House, the Lady Norwood Rose Garden and the Treehouse Visitor Centre. There is a large children's play area, a duck pond, and glowworms visible some nights along paths in the Main Garden ‚Äì there are monthly tours during autumn‚Äìspring (the Garden is otherwise closed at night). Large sculptures and carvings are located throughout the garden. These are by artists such as Henry Moore, Andrew Drummond, Mary-Louise Browne, Regan Gentry, Denis O'Connor and Chris Booth.

History The Garden was established in 1868. It was initially managed by the New Zealand Institute (later named the Royal Society Te ApƒÅrangi) and its manager James Hector until 1891. The New Zealand Institute planted conifers as part of a programme to import plant species and assess their potential for economic benefit to New Zealand. The first Map of the Garden in 1875 by John Buchanan also included the compilation of a list of all plants growing there, and a survey of native plants indigenous to the Reserve.

The four channels are arranged around the atoll as follows: the Kuda channel and the nearby Maa channel are on the north, the Gan channel is on the south, and the broad Villingili channel is on the southeast. The islands are protected from the storms and high waves of the Indian Ocean by barrier reefs. Coconut palms, the national tree, are able to grow almost everywhere on the islands of Addu Atoll. There are small lakes, wetlands, and marshy taro fields that are unique to Addu Atoll.  History  During the Second World War Addu atoll was the site of a secret Royal Navy base called HMS Haitan, to take advantage of the deep anchorage and sheltered natural harbour there.Stephen Roskill; The War at Sea Vol II (1954) HMSO (ISBN none) p25 Oil tanks and storage facilities were built on Gan island, together with an airstrip and a flying boat base. The base remained unknown to the Axis throughout the early years of the war.Britain's Secret Base; Mike Beninghof, Sept 2018, at avalanchepress.com: Retrieved 12 November 2019 In 1957 the base was transferred to the Royal Air Force as RAF Gan, before being closed down in 1975. The island is now the site of Addu's international airport.  Biology  The cosmopolitan white tern (\\"dhondheeni\\") is found in the Maldives only on Addu Atoll and is seen as a symbol of the islands. Addu Atoll also possesses particularly rich whale and dolphin fauna. A great diversity of species has been found there. Addu Atoll is the only area in the Maldives that was not affected by the 1998 global coral bleaching. The south of the Maldives was spared from the \\"too warm\\" major ocean currents of (El Ni√±o). The bright and healthy corals start at the top of giris and thilas (about 1 meter [3 ft] under the surface) and slope down with the reef to a depth of or more. = Inhabited islands = * See Meedhoo * See Hulhudhoo * See Hithadhoo * See Maradhoo * See Maradhoo-Feydhoo * See Feydhoo = Uninhabited islands = right * Abooh√©ra * Bodu Hajara * Boduh√©ragandu * Dhigih√©ra * Fahik√©d√©h√©rangada * Gan (Location of Gan International Airport) * Gaukendi * Geskalhuh√©ra * Hanked√© * Hanked√© * Hajara * Her√©-th√©r√© (Location of Canareef Island Resort) * Hikahera * Kafathalhaa * H√©ra * Kandu Huraa * K√©d√©vaah√©ra * Koahera Kuda * Kandih√©r√©ganda * Maahera * Maamendhoo * Madih√©ra * Mulik√©d√© * Savaaheli * Vashah√©ra * Villingili (Location of Shangri-La Resort)  Linguistics  The dialect spoken is called \\"Addu bas\\", and though it has similarities to the \\"Mulaku bas\\" of Fuvahmulah, it is somewhat different from the official form of the Dhivehi language. Traditionally, Addu bas was widely spoken amongst the educated masses of three different atolls in the south, who adopted it as their lingua franca. It has also been credited with being the most famous and widespread single dialect in the Republic of Maldives. However, when Addu declared independence and recognized itself as the United Suvadive Republic, the Mal√© language rather than Addu bas was used in official correspondence. Nevertheless, despite the difference in dialects, the written version is common throughout the Maldives.  Culture  Long ago Addu City was ruled by families appointed by the sultans in Mal√©, and may have had a matrilineal system of inheritance; it is very much a man's world today. There was a recent period in Addu history when the status quo changed for a while, when a more matriarchal society developed and women became the breadwinners. Addu Atoll has some of the earliest known settlements recorded in the country‚Äîspecifically, on the island of Meedhoo in the far north of the atoll.

Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65. Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies. Death benefit The death benefit of a whole life policy is normally the stated face amount. However, if the policy is \\"participating\\", the death benefit will be increased by any accumulated dividend values and/or decreased by any outstanding policy loans. (see example below) Certain riders, such as Accidental Death benefit may exist, which would potentially increase the benefit. In contrast, universal life policies (a flexible premium whole life substitute) may be structured to pay cash values in addition to the face amount, but usually do not guarantee lifetime coverage in such cases. Maturity A whole life policy is said to \\"mature\\" at death or the maturity age of 100, whichever comes first.Life Insurance, a Consumer's Handbook / Belth 2nd ed p22 To be more exact the maturity date will be the \\"policy anniversary nearest age 100\\". The policy becomes a \\"matured endowment\\" when the insured person lives past the stated maturity age. In that event the policy owner receives the face amount in cash. With many modern whole life policies, issued since 2009, maturity ages have been increased to 120. Increased maturity ages have the advantage of preserving the tax-free nature of the death benefit. In contrast, a matured endowment may have substantial tax obligations. Taxation The entire death benefit of a whole life policy is free of income tax, except in unusual cases.Tax Facts / The National Underwriter 2015 Ed p39 This includes any internal gains in cash values. The same is true of group life, term life, and accidental death policies. However, when a policy is cashed out before death, the treatment varies. With cash surrenders, any gain over total premiums paid will be taxable as ordinary income. The same is true in the case of a matured endowment.Tax Facts / National Underwriter 2015 Ed P32 This is why most people choose to take cash values out as a \\"loan\\" against the death benefit rather than a \\"surrender.\\" Any money taken as a loan is free from income tax as long as the policy remains in force. For participating whole life policies, the interest charged by the insurance company for the loan is often less than the dividend each year, especially after 10‚Äì15 years, so the policy owner can pay off the loan using dividends. If the policy is surrendered or canceled before death, any loans received above the cumulative value of premiums paid will be subject to tax as growth on investment. Although life insurance benefits are generally free of income tax, the same is not true of estate tax. In the US, life insurance will be considered part of a person's taxable estate to the extent he possesses \\"incidents of ownership.\\"IRC Sec 2042 Estate planners often use special irrevocable trusts to shield life insurance from estate taxes. Uses=Personal and family uses= Individuals may find whole life attractive because it offers coverage for an indeterminate length of time. It is the dominant choice for insuring so-called \\"permanent\\" insurance needs, including: * Funeral expenses, * Estate planning, * Surviving spouse income, and * Supplemental retirement income. Individuals may find whole life less attractive, due to the relatively high premiums, for insuring: * Large debts, * Temporary needs, such as children's dependency years, * Young families with large needs and limited income. In the second category, term life is generally considered more suitable and has played an increasingly larger role in recent years. =Business uses= Businesses may also have legitimate and compelling needs, including funding of: # Buy-sell agreements # Death of key personLife Insurance / Huebner & Black Ch 3 # Supplemental executive retirement plans (S.E.R.P.) # Deferred compensation While Term life may be suitable for Buy- Sell agreements and Key Person indemnification, cash value insurance is almost exclusively for Deferred Comp and S.E.R.P.'s. Level Premium Level premium whole life insurance (sometimes called ordinary whole life, though this term is also sometimes used more broadly) provides lifetime death benefit coverage for a level premium. Whole life premiums are much higher than term insurance premiums, but because term insurance premiums rise with increasing age of the insured, the cumulative value of all premiums paid under whole and term policies are roughly equal if the policy continues to average life expectancy. Part of the insurance contract stipulates that the policyholder is entitled to a cash value reserve that is part of the policy and guaranteed by the company. This cash value can be accessed at any time through policy loans that are received income tax-free and paid back according to mutually agreed-upon schedules. These policy loans are available until the insured's death. If any loans amounts are outstanding‚Äîi.e., not yet paid back‚Äîupon the insured's death, the insurer subtracts those amounts from the policy's face value/death benefit and pays the remainder to the policy's beneficiary. Whole life insurance may prove a better value than term for someone with an insurance need of greater than ten to fifteen years due to favorable tax treatment of interest credited to cash values. However, for those unable to afford the premium necessary to provide adequate whole life coverage for their current insurance needs, it would be imprudent to purchase less coverage than is adequate as whole life insurance rather than purchase an adequate level of term to cover their current need. While some life insurance companies market whole life as a \\"death benefit with a savings account\\", the distinction is artificial, according to life insurance actuaries Albert E. Easton and Timothy F. Harris. The net amount at risk is the amount the insurer must pay to the beneficiary should the insured die before the policy has accumulated premiums equal to the death benefit. It is the difference between the policy's current cash value (i.e., total paid in by owner plus that amount's interest earnings) and its face value/death benefit. Although the actual cash value may be different from the death benefit, in practice the policy is identified by its original face value/death benefit. The advantages of whole life insurance are its guaranteed death benefits; guaranteed cash values; fixed, predictable premiums; and mortality and expense charges that do not reduce the policy's cash value. The disadvantages of whole life are the inflexibility of its premiums and the fact that the internal rate of return of the policy may not be competitive with other savings and investment alternatives. Death benefit amounts of whole life policies can also be increased through accumulation and/or reinvestment of policy dividends, though these dividends are not guaranteed and may be higher or lower than earnings at existing interest rates over time. According to internal documents from some life insurance companies, the internal rate of return and dividend payment realized by the policyholder is often a function of when the policyholder buys the policy and how long that policy remains in force. Dividends paid on a whole life policy can be utilized in many ways. The life insurance manual defines policy dividends as refunds of premium over-payments. They are therefore not exactly like corporate stock dividends, which are payouts of net income from total revenues. Modified whole life insurance features smaller premiums for a specified period of time, followed by higher premiums for the remainder of the policy. Survivorship life insurance is whole life insurance insuring two lives, with proceeds payable after the second (later) death. The level premium system results in overpaying for the risk of dying at younger ages, and underpaying in later years toward the end of life.Life Insurance/Huebner & Black 9th ed P6 Reserves The over-payments inherent in the level premium system mean that a large portion of expensive old-age costs are prepaid during a person's younger years. U.S. Life insurance companies are required by state regulation to set up reserve funds to account for said over-payments, which represent promised future benefits, and are classified as Legal Reserve Life Insurance Companies. The Death Benefit promised by the contract is a fixed obligation calculated to be payable at the end of life expectancy, which may be 50 years or more in the future. (see non-forfeiture values) Most of the visible and apparent wealth of Life Insurance companies is due to the enormous assets (reserves) they hold to stand behind future liabilities. In fact, reserves are classified as a liability, since they represent obligations to policyholders.Life Insurance / Huebner & Black 9th Ed P 277-279 These reserves are primarily invested in bonds and other debt instruments, and are thus a major source of financing for government and private industry. Cash values Cash values are an integral part of a whole life policy, and reflect the reserves necessary to assure payment of the guaranteed death benefit. Thus, \\"cash surrender\\" (and \\"loan\\") values arise from the policyholder's rights to quit the contract and reclaim a share of the reserve fund attributable to his policy. (see #Example of non- forfeiture values below) Although life insurance is often sold with a view toward the \\"living benefits\\" (accumulated cash and dividend values), this feature is a byproduct of the level premium nature of the contract. The original intent was not to \\"sugar coat\\" the product; rather it is a necessary part of the design. However, prospective purchasers are often more motivated by the thought of being able to \\"count my money in the future.\\" Policies purchased at younger ages will usually have guaranteed cash values greater than the sum of all premiums paid after a number of years. Sales tactics frequently appeal to this self-interest (sometimes called \\"the greed motive\\"). It is a reflection of human behavior that people are often more willing to talk about money for their own future than to discuss provisions for the family in case of premature death (the \\"fear motive\\"). On the other hand, many policies purchased due to selfish motives will become vital family resources later in a time of need. The cash values in whole life policies grow at a guaranteed rate (usually 4%) plus an annual dividend. In certain states the cash value in the policies is 100% asset protected, meaning the cash value cannot be taken away in the event of a lawsuit or bankruptcy. Also if used and built correctly the cash value can be taken out of the policy on a tax-free basis. When discontinuing a policy, according to Standard Non-forfeiture Law, a policyholder is entitled to receive his share of the reserves, or cash values, in one of three ways (1) Cash, (2) Reduced Paid-up Insurance, or (3) Extended term insurance. Pricing methods=Non-participating= All values related to the policy (death benefits, cash surrender values, premiums) are usually determined at policy issue, for the life of the contract, and usually cannot be altered after issue. This means that the insurance company assumes all risk of future performance versus the actuaries' estimates. If future claims are underestimated, the insurance company makes up the difference. On the other hand, if the actuaries' estimates on future death claims are high, the insurance company will retain the difference. Non- participating policies are typically issued by Stock companies, with stockholder capital bearing the risk. Since whole life policies frequently cover a time span in excess of 50 years, it can be seen that accurate pricing is a formidable challenge. Actuaries must set a rate which will be sufficient to keep the company solvent through prosperity or depression, while remaining competitive in the marketplace. The company will be faced with future changes in Life expectancy, unforeseen economic conditions, and changes in the political and regulatory landscape. All they have to guide them is past experience. =Participating= In a participating policy (also \\"par\\" in the United States, and known as a \\"with-profits policy\\" in the Commonwealth), the insurance company shares the excess profits (divisible surplus) with the policyholder in the form of annual dividends. Typically these \\"refunds\\" are not taxable because they are considered an overcharge of premium (or \\"reduction of basis\\"). In general, the greater the overcharge by the company, the greater the refund/dividend ratio; however, other factors will also have a bearing on the size of the dividend. For a mutual life insurance company, participation also implies a degree of ownership of the mutuality. Participating policies are typically (although not exclusively) issued by Mutual life insurance companies. However, Stock companies sometimes issue participating policies. Premiums for a participating policy will be higher than for a comparable non-par policy, with the difference (or, \\"overcharge\\") being considered as \\"paid-in surplus\\" to provide a margin for error equivalent to stockholder capital. Illustrations of future dividends are never guaranteed. In the case of mutual companies, unneeded surplus is distributed retrospectively to policyholders in the form of dividends. Sources of surplus include conservative pricing, mortality experience more favorable than anticipated, excess interest, and savings in expenses of operation.\\"Life Insurance\\" Huebner & Black/ 9th ed p320 While the \\"overcharge\\" terminology is technically correct for tax purposes, actual dividends are often a much greater factor than the language would imply. For a period of time during the 1980s and '90's, it was not uncommon for the annual dividend to exceed the total premium at the 20th policy year and beyond.BEST'S FLITCRAFT 1985 Ed P561 {Milton Jones, CLU, ChFC} With non-participating policies, unneeded surplus is distributed as dividends to stockholders. =Indeterminate premium= Similar to non-participating, except that the premium may vary year to year. However, the premium will never exceed the maximum premium guaranteed in the policy. This allows companies to set competitive rates based on current economic conditions. Variations=Economic= A blending of participating and term life insurance, wherein a part of the dividends is used to purchase additional term insurance. This can generally yield a higher death benefit, at a cost to long term cash value. In some policy years the dividends may be below projections, causing the death benefit in those years to decrease. =Limited pay= Limited pay policies may be either participating or non-par, but instead of paying annual premiums for life, they are only due for a certain number of years, such as 20. The policy may also be set up to be fully paid up at a certain age, such as 65 or 80. The policy itself continues for the life of the insured. These policies would typically cost more up front, since the insurance company needs to build up sufficient cash value within the policy during the payment years to fund the policy for the remainder of the insured's life. With Participating policies, dividends may be applied to shorten the premium paying period. =Single premium= A form of limited pay, where the pay period is a single large payment up front. These policies typically have fees during early policy years should the policyholder cash it in. = Interest sensitive = This type is fairly new, and is also known as either \\"excess interest\\" or \\"current assumption\\" whole life. The policies are a mixture of traditional whole life and universal life. Instead of using dividends to augment guaranteed cash value accumulation, the interest on the policy's cash value varies with current market conditions. Like whole life, death benefit remains constant for life. Like universal life, the premium payment might vary, but not above the maximum premium guaranteed within the policy.  Requirements  Whole life insurance typically requires that the owner pay premiums for the life of the policy. There are some arrangements that let the policy be \\"paid up\\", which means that no further payments are ever required, in as few as 5 years, or with even a single large premium. Typically if the payor doesn't make a large premium payment at the outset of the life insurance contract, then he is not allowed to begin making them later in the contract life. However, some whole life contracts offer a rider to the policy which allows for a one time, or occasional, large additional premium payment to be made as long as a minimal extra payment is made on a regular schedule. In contrast, universal life insurance generally allows more flexibility in premium payment.  Guarantees  The company generally will guarantee that the policy's cash values will increase every year regardless of the performance of the company or its experience with death claims (again compared to universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance which can increase the costs and decrease the cash values of the policy). The dividends can be taken in one of three ways. The policy owner can be given a cheque from the insurance company for the dividends, the dividends can be used to reduce the premium payment, or the dividends can be reinvested back into the policy to increase the death benefit and the cash value at a faster rate. When the dividends paid on a whole life policy are chosen by the policy owner to be reinvested back into the policy, the cash value can increase at a rather substantial rate depending on the performance of the company. The cash value will grow tax-deferred with compounding interest. Even though the growth is considered \\"tax-deferred,\\" any loans taken from the policy will be tax-free as long as the policy remains in force. In addition, the death benefit remains tax-free (meaning no income tax and no estate tax). As the cash value increases, the death benefit will also increase and this growth is also non- taxable. The only way tax is ever due on the policy is (1) if the premiums were paid with pre-tax dollars, (2) if cash value is \\"withdrawn\\" past basis rather than \\"borrowed,\\" or (3) if the policy is surrendered. Most whole life policies can be surrendered at any time for the cash value amount, and income taxes will usually only be placed on the gains of the cash account that exceeds the total premium outlay. Thus, many are using whole life insurance policies as a retirement funding vehicle rather than for risk management. Liquidity Cash values are considered liquid assets because they are easily accessible at any time, usually with a phone call or fax to the insurance company requesting a \\"loan\\" or \\"withdrawal\\" from the policy. Most companies will transfer the money into the policy holder's bank account within a few days. Cash values are also liquid enough to be used for investment capital, but only if the owner is financially healthy enough to continue making premium payments (Single premium whole life policies avoid the risk of the insured failing to make premium payments and are liquid enough to be used as collateral. Single premium policies require that the insured pay a one time premium that tends to be lower than the split payments. Because these policies are fully paid at inception, they have no financial risk and are liquid and secure enough to be used as collateral under the insurance clause of collateral assignment.)Florida Life and Health Study Manual, 12 edition Cash value access is tax free up to the point of total premiums paid, and the rest may be accessed tax free in the form of policy loans. If the policy lapses, taxes would be due on outstanding loans. If the insured dies, death benefit is reduced by the amount of any outstanding loan balance. Internal rates of return for participating policies may be much worse than universal life and interest-sensitive whole life (whose cash values are invested in the money market and bonds) because their cash values are invested in the life insurance company and its general account, which may be in real estate and the stock market. However, universal life policies run a much greater risk, and are actually designed to lapse. Variable universal life insurance may outperform whole life because the owner can direct investments in sub-accounts that may do better. If an owner desires a conservative position for his cash values, par whole life is indicated. Reported cash values might seem to \\"disappear\\" or become \\"lost\\" when the death benefit is paid out. The reason for this is that cash values are considered to be part of the death benefit. The insurance company pays out the cash values with the death benefit because they are inclusive of each other. This is why loans from the cash value are not taxable as long as the policy is in force (because death benefits are not taxable).

P. Yohannan in 1979, focusing on residents of Asian countries. The organization is located about five miles southwest of Wills Point, Texas, a small community east of Dallas. Gospel for Asia is present in India, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Laos and Thailand. The group has faced class action suits in the U.S. and Canada over their dispersement of the collected funds, the GFA settled the US case at a cost of $50 million. History Gospel For Asia was founded in 1980 by K.P. Yohannan who sought to evangelize Christianity in Asia. Yohannan toured U.S. churches, engaging in fundraising efforts to sponsor missionaries working within their own Asian nations. The organization has since grown to support various humanitarian and spiritual programs as well as working with outside organizations, including local governments and the Believer's Eastern Church, which owns and operates hospitals, colleges and public and residential schools. Most of these are for- profit enterprises. Narada News has reported that BEC will be expanding their investments by building as many as 500 additional international schools. The list of what is currently operating includes some hospitals and clinics, some colleges, 9 schools located within small towns of southern Rajasthan, and at least four public schools. In 2014, the Believers' Eastern Church purchased the Cheruvally Estate, a 2,268-acre (9.18 km2) rubber estate in Kerala, India as an investment to help fund social work among underdeveloped communities. In mid-2015, the government initially confiscated the land from the Believers' Eastern Church in order to build an airport, but that decision was appealed. After a 3-year long legal battle between the government and the Believers' Eastern Church, it was decided by an Indian High Court that the Believers' Eastern Church has the ownership right of the Cheruvally Estate and the government must pay them for the land if they still choose to build an airport in that location. Believers near their church building Programs The goal of GFA focuses on the formation of missionaries native to the nation the missionary is serving, with special emphasis on Asia. The organization has defined its primary mission field as being those people that live in the 10/40 Window, a rectangular region extending from west Africa to east Asia and between 10 and 40 degrees north longitude. By concentrating on this region GFA ministers to a dense population of largely poor communities that have had limited or no exposure to the Christian faith.Gospel for Asia official website.‚ÄúGospel for Asia: What We Do.‚Äù Retrieved 5 March 2016. =National missionaries= This is a team of national missionaries with their bicycles working in a remote region of Asia.

Yohannan has stated that he does not limit \\"national missionaries\\" to formal nation-states, instead focusing on differences in culture and language to define nationalities. This approach might result in several specialized missionary groups within a single nation-state, from large cities and regions down to small tribes and villages. In 2018 GFA reported that they have over 16,000 missionaries and church planters in 18 Asian nations.Houston, Rickey. ‚ÄúLoving Your Neighbor: A Guide to Developing and Sustaining Community Service Projects.‚Äù Liberty University Baptist Theological Seminary Doctor of Ministry Thesis, March 2013.

By 2018, the organization helped construct almost 7,000 wells and BioSand water filters. The wells are typically maintained by Gospel for Asia-supported pastors or their church members, preventing the wells from breaking down and ensuring they last for up to 2 decades. =Illiteracy and poverty= GFA's Bridge of Hope after-school program assists underprivileged villages through ongoing literacy and education for their boys and girls. This education helps children and their families to overcome generational poverty and avoid the worlds of bonded labor and sex-slave trade. There are more than 600 of these centers. Students at the centers receive daily education and a nutritious meal, school supplies and uniforms as well as free medical care. GFA is using these centers as a way to alleviate the root causes of impoverishment and gender discrimination in Asian countries as well as inhumane child labor practices. According to reports, in 2018 GFA assisted \\"more than 70,000 children, free medical services in over 1,200 villages and remote communities, 4,000 wells drilled, 11,000 water filters installed, Christmas gifts for more than 200,000 needy families, and spiritual teaching available in 110 languages in 14 nations through radio ministry\\". =Kerala Floods= In 2018, flooding in Kerala left over 200,000 Indian people without homes.

Upon the completion of Erwin's investigation, a report was released. Erwin later admitted, after resigning from Gospel for Asia's board, that the report was dictated to him by GFA's president and founder Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) who was displeased with Erwin's actual findings and original report. According to Erwin, \\"When I first presented the conclusions of my investigation to KP (with David Carroll present) KP glanced at it, declared that he was a speed reader, and began what I will simply call an ugly scene filled with brutal expressions I don‚Äôt wish to repeat...\\". Erwin's report was discarded and a new report was written and given to the board, which was portrayed as Erwin's own report. Erwin wrote a letter to GFA President K.P. Yohannan on 17 March 2015 after seeing the false report. In this letter, he states \\"I think you are well aware that I cannot agree with this letter except for the generic niceties about wanting biblical reconciliation\\", and also \\"I think you exonerate yourself and GFA.\\" Erwin eventually provided his original report to the GFA Diaspora group, along with an apology for allowing the false report to be distributed. =Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability revokes Gospel for Asia's membership= In September 2015, GFA lost their 36-year membership in the financial standards advocacy group Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA), with the ECFA reporting that GFA had not met many of their required standards of excellence in financial accountability and governance.  ECFA's report  The ECFA had been conducting and investigation into Gospel for Asia for four months before releasing the results and revoking the organization's membership. The ECFA states that GFA's membership was \\"Terminated for failure to comply with: * Standard 2: Governance * Standard 3: Financial Oversight * Standard 4: Use of Resources * Standard 6: Compensation-Setting and Related-Party Transactions * Standard 7.1: Truthfulness in Communications * Standard 7.2: Giver Expectations and Intent The ECFA also noted in their report that \\"Certain information provided to ECFA by GFA that was crucial to our review was, at least initially, inaccurate\\", and also that \\"Certain pertinent information about the compliance issues was not revealed to ECFA by GFA until late in the review process.\\" Additionally the ECFA stated that \\"We have learned significant information from sources unrelated to GFA that we should have learned directly from GFA.\\" In the letter revoking GFA's membership, the ECFA listed seventeen concerns.  GFA response  The GFA board responded with a statement that noted \\"ECFA's decision was made after conducting a special review of Gospel for Asia, and we respect ECFA's evaluation. Our response was to begin a focused review and to implement the ECFA's recommended improvements\\". =Class action lawsuit= In 2017 Gospel for Asia was accused by Arkansas couple Garland Murphy and his wife Phyllis of raising funds for charity \\"while covertly diverting the money to a multimillion-dollar personal empire.\\" The couple filed a class action RICO anti-fraud lawsuit against GFA's president and several GFA leaders, seeking to substantiate GFA's claims of where it spent the money donors gave to the organization. The case was settled after three years of court proceedings in which GFA and the plaintiff agreed \\"all donations designated for use in the field were ultimately sent to the field\\". Those entitled to join the class action were those United States residents who donated to Gospel for Asia between the dates of 1 January 2009 and 10 September 2018. Information regarding the lawsuit has been published on the official Murphy v Gospel for Asia website. That court case states that in 2013, \\"Despite GFA‚Äôs explicit representations that it would spend in the field 100 percent of every dollar donors designated for the field, GFA spent only $14.9 million of $118.6 million on actual relief efforts, instead spending far more on salaries and overhead\\", according to the complaint. \\"The Murphys (the plaintiffs), of Bentonville, Arkansas, say that Gospel for Asia raised more than $450 million in donations from the United States alone from 2007 to 2013, much of which Yohannan redirected to his personal empire.\\" On 4 June 2018 Federal Court Judge Brooks ordered GFA to pay for a Special Master to oversee the gathering of evidence for the discovery phase. Judge Brooks stated, \\"Therefore, the court finds that the defendants abusive conduct in this case since August constitutes a willful violation of its clear discovery orders.\\" In February 2019 Gospel for Asia lost an appeal denying a stay against discovery. Brooks noted, \\"The fundamental question in this case has always been whether these entities have in fact redirected donated money in violation of promises that were made to their donors around the world\\".https://www.docketbird.com/court-documents/Murphy-v-Gospel-For-Asia- Inc-et-al/MEMORANDUM-OPINION-AND-ORDER-denying-85-Motion-for-Protective-Order- granting-94-Motion-for-Sanctions-and-deferring-ruling-on-104-Motion-for- Sanctions-Signed-by-Honorable-Timothy-L-Brooks-on- June-4-2018/arwd-5:2017-cv-05035-00125 Gospel for Asia denied the Plaintiffs' allegations, maintaining all money designated for the field went to the field. GFA denied all misdirection of funds and willful misleading of donors. At the end of February 2019 a settlement was announced. Gospel for Asia agreed to pay 37 million dollars to refund donations to 200,000 donors, $12,210,000 in Plaintiff's attorney fees and $750,000 in Plaintiff's attorney's expenses as expressed in the Final Order and Judgment. According to the settlement agreement, \\"All funds designated to the field were sent to the field and used for ministry purposes; and no Individual Defendant, as defined herein, received any improper personal gain or enrichment from or related to donated funds\\". The settlement agreement also requires that K. P. Yohannan's wife Gisela be removed from the board of the charity for three years and for Garland Murphy, one of the plaintiffs, to be given a seat and another person appointed to the board acceptable to both Murphy and K. P. Yohannan; in addition a subcommittee of the board which will include Murphy but neither Yohannan nor his son, Daniel Punnose, will produce annual reports for the board, the Judge and the lead counsel for three years. Legal documents related to the case including the settlement agreement. Although the settlement has been reached, GFA maintains that the settlement is not an acknowledgment of guilt. There are also alleged problems with the Canada office. =GFA UK= The United Kingdom GFA office has received the attention of the UK Charity Commission, a government agency that investigates charity-related fraud. =GFA New Zealand= Gospel for Asia's New Zealand office operated out of space provided to them by the church Calvary Chapel Auckland. Once Calvary Chapel became aware of the controversies stirring in the United States, an investigation into GFA's practices was launched. Finding that the work on the field did not at all resemble what GFA had presented to the church and that many for-profit enterprises were run using donated funds, GFA was told to leave the building and the church ceased supporting the ministry. =GFA World (formerly GFA Canada)= Gospel for Asia's Canadian arm is subject to a $170 million class action suit launched in Feb of 2020 by Greg Zentner of Woodburn, Nova Scotia., alleging the charity \\"defrauded or made negligent misstatements to donors and civilly conspired to misrepresent the nature of donations collected.\\" Citing the suit and a steep drop in donations due to the publicity, and the COVID-19 Pandemic, GFA World filed a request for Creditor Protection with the Ontario Superior Court on 26 June 2020. The Court placed their operations under trustee management of PricewaterhouseCoopers. During this period GFA may still collect donations but no disbursements may be made without PwC oversight. =Believer's Church= There is also considerable controversy in India considering GFA. The Times of India has reported that \\"The Believers [Eastern] Church, founded by Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan), and three NGOs associated with it have been barred from bringing in foreign funds to India with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) canceling their FCRA registrations.\\" As of September 2017, GFA provided the requested documents for review to MHA and \\"Fr Panthapallil said though the MHA website has advertised that the registrations of the four organisations are cancelled, they are still under revision.\\" In August 2017, the Church of South India (CSI) decided to have a \\"non- cooperative stance\\" towards the Kerala Council of Churches (KCC), an ecumenical forum of non-Catholic Protestant Churches in Kerala, in protest against the KCC decision to provide membership to the Believers Church since the leader, Yohannan, claims to be a CSI bishop, a claim CSI denies. Narada News in India reported concerning that, \\"The CSI senate committee probed the issue. They came to the conclusion that their bishop was paid huge sums of money and a luxury car for this. The church sacked bishop KJ Samuel from the CSI for this deed.\\" There is also been an ongoing court case regarding the illegal filling in of wetlands in order to build the Believers Church Medical College Hospital. GFA has been paying a special tax because a \\"substantial\\" amount of its income is not used for intended purposes of the fundraising. An Indian court said, \\"It is not in dispute that substantial income of the assessee trust was not used by both the assessees for the purposes for which they were formed.\\" Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) says that the claims were politically motivated and that the workings of Gospel for Asia and Believers Church are transparent. GFA has been accused of engaging in predatory proselytization while providing aid in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. The Hindu American Foundation criticized the organization for, according to it, pressuring vulnerable tsunami victims to convert to Christianity, setting up illegal unregistered orphanages and forcing orphans recite the Christian prayers several times a day.

History  Molecular Vaccines, Inc. was founded by Wayne T. Hockmeyer, David Mott, and Dr. James Young in 1988. In 1989, Molecular Vaccines, Inc changed its name to MedImmune, Inc. On April 23, 2007, it was announced MedImmune and AstraZeneca entered into a definitive agreement under which AstraZeneca intended to acquire MedImmune in an all-cash transaction at US$ 58 per share, or about US$ 15.2 billion. On 19 June 2007 AstraZeneca completed the acquisition paying US$ 15.2 billion primarily for its drug development pipeline. Analysts have criticised the take-over, claiming that AstraZeneca paid too much. AstraZeneca chose to merge MedImmune with Cambridge Antibody Technology, which it had acquired in 2006, creating a new biologics division under the MedImmune name. AstraZeneca presented the new MedImmune to investors on 7 December 2007.

This can be contrasted with other processes‚Äîe.g., large-scale flow of the atmosphere‚Äîthat are explicitly resolved within the models. Associated with these parameterizations are various parameters used in the simplified processes. Examples include the descent rate of raindrops, convective clouds, simplifications of the atmospheric radiative transfer on the basis of atmospheric radiative transfer codes, and cloud microphysics. Radiative parameterizations are important to both atmospheric and oceanic modeling alike. Atmospheric emissions from different sources within individual grid boxes also need to be parameterized to determine their impact on air quality.  Clouds  Field of cumulus clouds Weather and climate model gridboxes have sides of between and . A typical cumulus cloud has a scale of less than , and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion. Therefore, the processes that such clouds represent are parameterized, by processes of various sophistication. In the earliest models, if a column of air in a model gridbox was unstable (i.e., the bottom warmer than the top) then it would be overturned, and the air in that vertical column mixed. More sophisticated schemes add enhancements, recognizing that only some portions of the box might convect and that entrainment and other processes occur. Weather models that have gridboxes with sides between and can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they still need to parameterize cloud microphysics. The formation of large-scale (stratus-type) clouds is more physically based: they form when the relative humidity reaches some prescribed value. Still, sub grid scale processes need to be taken into account. Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the cloud fraction can be related to a critical relative humidity of 70% for stratus-type clouds, and at or above 80% for cumuliform clouds, reflecting the sub grid scale variation that would occur in the real world. Portions of the precipitation parameterization include the condensation rate, energy exchanges dealing with the change of state from water vapor into liquid drops, and the microphysical component which controls the rate of change from water vapor to water droplets.  Radiation and atmosphere-surface interaction  The amount of solar radiation reaching ground level in rugged terrain, or due to variable cloudiness, is parameterized as this process occurs on the molecular scale. This method of parameterization is also done for the surface flux of energy between the ocean and the atmosphere in order to determine realistic sea surface temperatures and type of sea ice found near the ocean's surface. Also, the grid size of the models is large when compared to the actual size and roughness of clouds and topography. Sun angle as well as the impact of multiple cloud layers is taken into account. Soil type, vegetation type, and soil moisture all determine how much radiation goes into warming and how much moisture is drawn up into the adjacent atmosphere. Thus, they are important to parameterize.  Air quality  Visualization of a buoyant also known as Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume Air quality forecasting attempts to predict when the concentrations of pollutants will attain levels that are hazardous to public health. The concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere is determined by transport, diffusion, chemical transformation, and ground deposition. Alongside pollutant source and terrain information, these models require data about the state of the fluid flow in the atmosphere to determine its transport and diffusion. Within air quality models, parameterizations take into account atmospheric emissions from multiple relatively tiny sources (e.g. roads, fields, factories) within specific grid boxes.  Problems with increased resolution  As model resolution increases, errors associated with moist convective processes are increased as assumptions which are statistically valid for larger grid boxes become questionable once the grid boxes shrink in scale towards the size of the convection itself. At resolutions greater than T639, which has a grid box dimension of about , the Arakawa-Schubert convective scheme produces minimal convective precipitation, making most precipitation unrealistically stratiform in nature.  Calibration  When a physical process is parameterized, two choices have to be made: what is the structural form (for instance, two variables can be related linearly) and what is the exact value of the parameters (for instance, the constant of proportionality). The process of determining the exact values of the parameters in a parameterization is called calibration, or sometimes less precise, tuning. Calibration is a difficult process, and different strategies are used to do it. One popular method is to run a model, or a submodel, and compare it to a small set of selected metrics, such as temperature. The parameters that lead to the model run which resembles reality best are chosen.

The lower portions of the walls were left standing after the fire since they were built with a stronger stone. Teishebaini is situated at a height of .Teishebaini Elevation and Position  History  The city of Teishebaini was built by Rusa II in mid-7th century BCIan Lindsay and Adam T. Smith, A History of Archaeology in the Republic of Armenia, Journal of Field Archaeology, Vol. 31, No. 2, Summer, 2006:173. to protect the eastern borders of Urartu from the barbaric Cimmerians and Scythians. Within the city was a governors palace that contained a hundred and twenty rooms spreading across more than , and citadel named the Citadel of Teisheba after the Urartian god of war. The palace was made of stone, with timber ceilings, and timber columns that supported the roof. The construction of the city, palace, and the citadel were not fully finished until the reign of Rusa III, some 50 years later. Agriculture was essential to the city, as was raising livestock. The Urartians built massive water canals, some of which are still in use to this day. Archaeological excavations have shown that lentils, hemp, peas, sesame, wheat, and barley were some of the grains that were grown in the area, as well as grapes and plums. The grape seeds that had been found were examined further and it revealed that twelve varieties of grape were grown in the surrounding area of Teishebaini during this time. All of these ancient varieties and more are still grown to this day in modern Armenia. Smaller ceramic vessels were also found in excavations and are known to have been used in brewing beer made from barley. Other much larger vessels were used for storing foods and wine. Small circular markings on the sides of the containers near the top indicated the amount that could be stored inside. The vessels were usually buried half- way into the soil which naturally kept foods cool. The site was discovered in 1939 after being buried for more than two and a half millennia. A cuneiform inscription had been found three years earlier that led to the discovery of the ancient city. It read, 'Rusa Argishti-hini' which translates to \\"Rusa, son of Argishti\\" also known as Rusa II. Another set of cuneiform inscriptions were found written upon a bronze belt and bronze bolt, both bearing the words \\"Rusa Argishti, fortress of the city of Teishebaini.\\" The inscriptions helped date the site and tell who its builder was. In 1941 an ivory statuette of the god Teisheba was found within the citadel. The excavations here are considered as one of the most important archaeological discoveries and findings in the Middle East, the Near East and Asia Minor. Some of the findings include carved ivory, stone, ceramics, metal figurines, pottery and an astonishing wide variety of bronze domestic tools and utensils, military equipment decorated with mythological symbols, forms and animals, daggers, swords, helmets, arrows, quivers, shields of an advanced metallurgy, as well as vases, bracelets, earrings and medallions in gold and varied sets of other jewelry. Pottery found in the site was either painted black or had painted designs such as waves of water. Archaeological evidence shows that the city of Teishebaini was destroyed by fire sometime around the beginning of the 6th century BC. Numerous fragments of cloth, rope, and other items such as seeds have been found charred from the city's destruction. It is thought that Teishebaini was attacked during the night since numerous human remains have been found, and rooms within the buildings still had everything in them as if the people living within the city's walls had no chance to flee. During the excavations, skeletons were found holding objects of gold in their hands. It is theorized that when the city was set on fire, that residents of the city began either to loot or save their own possessions from the burning buildings as the city was under attack.

Every additive utility function is weakly-additive. However, additivity is applicable only to cardinal utility functions, while weak additivity is applicable to ordinal utility functions. Weak additivity is often a realistic assumption when dividing up goods between claimants, and simplifies the mathematics of certain fair division problems considerably.

Born and raised in Amsterdam among a musical family, van Leer took up the piano and flute as a child and pursued them at university and music academies. From 1967 to 1969, van Leer performed in a theatre cabaret act headed by Ramses Shaffy as his backing vocalist and musician, recorded singles as a solo artist, and produced, arranged, and conducted music for Bojoura. He formed Trio Thijs van Leer, a three-piece rock band which evolved into Focus in late 1969 following the addition of guitarist Jan Akkerman. Focus achieved international success following the release of Moving Waves (1971) and its lead single, \\"Hocus Pocus\\", which features van Leer's yodelling and whistling. After several albums with various line-ups, van Leer disbanded Focus in 1978; he reformed the band in 2002. Van Leer achieved success as a solo artist in the Netherlands. His first two solo albums featuring classical flute, Introspection (1972) and Introspection 2 (1975), sold an estimated 1.2 million copies. He has collaborated with various artists, and continues to release albums and perform in various capacities. In 2008, van Leer was made a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau for special services to music.  Early life  Van Leer was born on 31 March 1948 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. His father Ed, a Jewish refugee from the Netherlands, was a classically trained flautist and businessman; his mother Mary was a singer and involved in the Sufi Movement. Van Leer began playing the piano at age three, taught by his mother, and later received lessons from famed pianists Maria Stroo (later Marja Bon) and Gerard Hengeveld. When he was six, van Leer wrote his first composition \\"Uncle Willy\\", a tribute to family friend and keyboard teacher Willy Buard who helped pay for his father's flute studies at the Conservatoire de Musique de Gen√®ve in Geneva. At eleven, van Leer was given a flute by his father who began teaching his son two years later after he discovered van Leer wished to instead pursue jazz music after he discovered the genre particularly through Miles Davis albums. He said, \\"I suppose I wanted to reject what I was brought up on. But then I thought the combination of jazz and classical music could be used in rock.\\" With his parents and two brothers, eldest Frank and youngest Maarten, who played the bassoon and piano and flute, respectively, the family would often play music at home together. Van Leer also took up painting, modelling, and performing in plays. Van Leer attended Hilversum Grammar School where he learned English, French, German, Latin and Ancient Greek. His father was the conductor of the school orchestra, for which van Leer played the harpsichord. He joined the Raoul Angenot Quintet, and at eighteen, won an award at inter-school contests for playing Andante in C Major by Mozart on flute, singing an original love poem to \\"Stella by Starlight\\" by Davis, a drama improvisation featuring his own poetry, and an original piano composition titled \\"Nooit Zal Ik Vergeten (De Nachten Samen met Jou)\\" (\\"Never Shall I Forget (The Nights Together with You)\\". He then joined the Bob de Lat Quartet, who once came fifth in the annual Hilversum jazz contest. After graduating, van Leer did not feel confident enough to attend a music school, so he studied art history at Amsterdam University which he found \\"very dry\\". He then learned harmony and counterpoint at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam, but disliked the lessons and left early. This was followed by a degree in the flute and composition at the Conservatoire de Musique de Gen√®ve. Van Leer also received tutoring on the piano, orchestration and arrangement with composer and conductor Rogier van Otterloo, and organ with Anthon van der Horst. During his time studying, van Leer participated in plays including those by William Shakespeare and John Webster. Van Leer has cited Steve Winwood, Traffic, Brian Wilson, and The Beach Boys as musical influences who helped inspired him to pursue rock music, with B√©la Bart√≥k and Johann Sebastian Bach among his favourite composers.  Career = With Ramses Shaffy = Around 1967, van Leer recorded \\"Nooit Zal Ik Vergeten\\" which Phonogram Records released as a 7\\" single which received little attention. In December 1967, during his first year at Amsterdam University, van Leer, unhappy with the course, landed a leading role in the Webster play The Duchess of Malfi. At one rehearsal, he learned from radio and television presenter Willem Duys that singer and actor Ramses Shaffy was in the process of hiring a final member to his four-piece backing band and vocal group for his upcoming theatre act, Shaffy Chantant. Van Leer had seen Shaffy's performances before and enjoyed the singing and jazz-oriented songs. After he called Shaffy and insisted he was suitable for the part, van Leer got an audition within the hour and secretly took his mother's car to get there. Had the audition failed, van Leer later said he would have pursued an acting career. With a performance of \\"Nooit Zal Ik Vergeten\\" at the piano, Shaffy was impressed and added van Leer to the cast which included singer Liesbeth List and pianist Louis van Dijk. Shaffy Chantant ran for almost one year from February 1968 for six nights a week, and van Leer was paid 114 guilders a week. A recording of the act was released in 1968 by Philips Records; van Leer learned from Shaffy years later that the track \\"Jij Bent Nu Daarbinnen\\" (\\"You Are Now Within\\") was about him. In 1968, during his time with Shaffy, van Leer recorded his second solo single on Philips, \\"Zolang de Wereld Nog Draait\\" (\\"As Long As the World Still Turns\\"), a Dutch-language version of \\"Les Bicyclettes de Belsize\\" by Engelbert Humperdinck. This landed him an invitation from drummer Hans Cleuver in September 1968 to play the flute with bassist Martijn Dresden and himself on Jazz and Poetry, a program on the Catholic radio station KRO. For several months they performed on the station with van Leer on the piano, organ, and the addition of \\"strange\\" vocals. Van Leer stayed with Shaffy for his next play Shaffy Verkeerd, which opened in January 1969 and featured singer Anneke Gr√∂nloh and performances of \\"MacArthur Park\\" by Jimmy Webb and \\"I Shall Be Released\\" by Bob Dylan, two songs that influenced van Leer as it \\"Opened my eyes to the use of lyrics. Before that I only really concentrated on instrumental music\\". Van Leer's final show with Shaffy was Sunset Sunkiss, which received an album release in 1969 on the Philips label with Cleuver and Dresden in the band. This was followed by several performances from the group at some large venues, including shows at the Holland Festival backed by the Metropole Orchestra, the Carr√© Theatre, and the RAI Centre. = Focus and collaborations = van Leer in November 1971. After van Leer left Shaffy's theatre group in mid-1969, he formed a three-piece rock band with Cleuver and Dresden, playing local gigs with a set of covers by Traffic and their own material under the early names of Trio Thijs van Leer and Thijs van Leer and the Rebaptised. They also recorded several radio and television commercials. In November 1969 they were joined by guitarist Jan Akkerman, who had performed with the three on Sunset Sunkiss, and settled on the name Focus, thus completing the first line-up of the band. From December 1969 to June 1970, the four were members of the pit band for the Dutch performance of the rock musical Hair. Focus released their first album, Focus Plays Focus, better known as its international title In and Out of Focus, in August 1970. Van Leer became a prominent figure in the group, writing the majority of their songs and singing English lyrics. After a line-up change, the band released Moving Waves (1971) that included their international hit single \\"Hocus Pocus\\" which featured van Leer's distinct vocals, yodelling, whistling, and scat singing. His influence from the Sufi movement through his mother is displayed in \\"Moving Waves\\", a piano and vocal composition he wrote when he was sixteen and quotes a teaching from its creator, Inayat Khan. The album closes with \\"Eruption\\", a 22-minute track that is \\"based on a musical idea\\" by van Leer who gained inspiration from the operas Orfeo ed Euridice by Christoph Willibald Gluck and L'Orfeo by Claudio Monteverdi, combining rock, jazz and classical influences. Focus 3 (1972) includes the band's second hit single \\"Sylvia\\" and includes van Leer's organ and operatic vocals. Van Leer's classical background is evident on the van Leer/Akkerman penned title track on Hamburger Concerto from 1974, based on Variations on a Theme by Haydn by Johannes Brahms. The miniature \\"Delitae Musicae\\" equally belongs to Monteverdi. In 1969, van Leer played the flute on Love Me or Leave Me (1969) by Dutch singer Rita Hovink. The following year, van Leer wrote, arranged and conducted music for singer Bojoura for her third album, The Beauty of Bojoura (1970). She had previously worked with van Leer's trio with Shaffy, singing a cover of \\"Frank Mills\\" from Hair. Robin Lent used van Leer to play piano and flute on Scarecrow's Journey (1971), and arranged and played the flute on the Dutch cast production album of Oh! Calcutta! (1971). Van Leer headed Focus through several line-up changes, and by early 1976 he and bass player Bert Ruiter was the only remaining original members; the group disbanded in 1978. In 2002, van Leer reformed Focus which has since released the albums Focus 8, Focus 9 / New Skin, \\"Live In Europe\\", Focus X,, Golden Oldies, Focus 8.5 / Beyond the Horizon, \\"The Focus Family Album\\" and Focus 11. = Solo career and other projects = In mid-1972, after securing a solo recording deal with CBS Records, van Leer released his first solo album, Introspection. It features a selection of classical pieces by Bach and Gabriel Faure, Focus songs, and original compositions arranged for flute and orchestra by van Otterloo, and soprano vocals by Letty de Jong. Introspection was a commercial success in the Netherlands, reaching number one for three weeks in early 1973 and earning a gold certification. In late 1975, van Leer released Introspection 2 which spent one week at number one in the Netherlands during a 19-week stay in the top 10. Van Leer continued the album series with Introspection 3, in 1977. After Focus split in 1978, van Leer continued with his solo career and took part in various projects. He formed the rock band Conxi, featuring Dutch and Senegalese musicians, and a rock group Van Leer with an American singer. In the early 1980s, van Leer worked and toured with Spanish singer Miguel R√≠os playing keyboards and flute on his albums Extra√±os en el escaparate (1981), Rock & R√≠os (1982) and El rock de una noche de verano (1983).Thijs van Leer Discography In 1981, van Leer formed the multi-national band Pedal Point with musicians Tato Gomez and from Chile and Paul Shigihara from Japan. They recorded a double album, Dona Nobis Pacem, based on a composition van Leer had written that he later cited as \\"one of the most important compositions of mine\\", and a high point of his career in an artistic sense. In 1985, van Leer reunited with Akkerman and together recorded Focus: Jan Akkerman & Thijs van Leer (1985). Van Leer was one of the artists who recorded the song Shalom from Holland (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991. He also appeared as a guest musician on the album, Into the Electric Castle, by Arjen Anthony Lucassen's musical project Ayreon. In 2008, Explore Multimedia released van Leer's first solo album in almost a decade, The Home Concert. The album features recordings made in his living room as he played material for Focus 9. The album is exclusively available online.Explore Multimedia. Explore Multimedia. On 13 September 2008, van Leer was made a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau for \\"special services to music.\\" In 2010, van Leer performed at a concert with Raccomandata Ricevuta Ritorno to celebrate 40 years of imaginative music (7 November 2010). Personal life On 15 May 1972, van Leer married Rosalie Peters. Together they had two children: daughter Bella and son Banten. The marriage ended in divorce by the early 1980s. He subsequently married Thea van der Kaay, ex-wife of Ruud Jacobs, but after twenty years they divorced too. Together they had three children: Eva and Berenice and son Ruben. Presently van Leer lives in Lathum, the Netherlands with his third wife, Annelies Lommen.

Another use of the word refers to intentional and illegal use of property or funds; it can particularly refer to when done by a public official. Criminal law In criminal law, misappropriation is the intentional, illegal use of the property or funds of another person for one's own use or other unauthorized purpose, particularly by a public official, a trustee of a trust, an executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate or by any person with a responsibility to care for and protect another's assets (a fiduciary duty). Depending upon the jurisdiction and value of the property, misappropriation may be a felony, a crime punishable by a prison sentence. Scientific research In scientific research, misappropriation is a type of research misconduct. An investigator, scholar or reviewer can obtain novel ideas during the process of the exchange of ideas amongst colleagues and peers. However, improper use of such information could constitute fraud. This can include plagiarism of work or to make use of any information in breach of any duty of confidentiality associated with the review of manuscripts or grant applications. Consequences of misappropriation Misappropriation can have very serious consequences, including imprisonment, fines, probation, and a permanent criminal record. The punishment for misappropriation may be determined by the value of the property affected and previous criminal record. Defenses Since misappropriation is considered a form of theft, arguments countering charges of theft can be modified and utilized against misappropriation, including: *Property did not belong to the plaintiff. Information which is available to everyone, such as facts in a news story, is considered public and thus cannot be owned by the plaintiff. *Independent development of property. The defendant did not ‚Äútake‚Äù the plaintiff's trade secrets if the defendant created the trade secrets independent of the plaintiff's knowledge, resources and involvement. *Consent by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff had given the defendant permission to use the property for a purpose, then the defendant cannot be guilty of misuse if the defendant used the property for that purpose. Differences between misappropriation and embezzlement Embezzlement is misappropriation when the property or funds involved have been lawfully entrusted to the embezzler. In circumstances where the funds are accessible to, but not entrusted to, the perpetrator, it is not embezzlement but can still be considered larceny, misappropriation, misapplication, or some other similar term. Examples of misappropriation For an example, see ¬ß1803 of the Judicial Council of California's Civil Jury Instructions from 2013.

He is a former Dominican priest, ordained in 1960, but left the priesthood that same year. After graduating from the University of Salamanca, he moved to the United States in 1961 to study for a PhD at Columbia University. There, he studied for his doctorate under Theodosius Dobzhansky, graduating in 1964. He became a US citizen in 1971. He has been President and Chairman of the Board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. At University of California, Irvine, his academic appointments included University Professor and Donald Bren Professor of Biological Sciences, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (School of Biological Sciences), Professor of Philosophy (School of Humanities), and Professor of Logic and the Philosophy of Science (School of Social Sciences). On July 1, 2018, Dr. Ayala officially resigned from the University of California, Irvine, due to substantiated sexual harassment claims. His name was removed from the School of Biological Sciences, the Science Library, as well as various graduate fellowships, scholarship programs, and endowed chairs. Details of the charges were made public online on July 20, 2018 in an elaborate 97-page investigative report detailing the sexual harassment that occurred as early as 2003 and as recently as 2018. Career He is known for his research on population and evolutionary genetics, and has been called the \\"Renaissance Man of Evolutionary Biology\\". His \\"discoveries have opened up new approaches to the prevention and treatment of diseases that affect hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide\\", including demonstrating the reproduction of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, is mostly the product of cloning, and that only a few clones account for most of this widespread, mostly untreatable South American disease that affects 16 million to 18 million people. He served on the advisory board of the now defunct Campaign to Defend the Constitution, an organization that has lobbied in support the separation of church and state. He has been publicly critical of U.S. restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. He is also a critic of intelligent design theories, claiming that they are not only pseudoscience, but also misunderstood from a theological point of view. He suggests that the theory of evolution resolves the problem of evil, thus being a kind of theodicy. Although Ayala generally does not discuss his religious views, he has stated that \\"science is compatible with religious faith in a personal, omnipotent and benevolent God.\\" He also briefly served, in 1960, as a Dominican priest.Ruse, Michael. Can a Darwinian Be a Christian? : The Relationship between Science and Religion. Cambridge University Press: New York, xi + 242 pp. 2001, p. 75 Ayala does not say whether he remains a religious believer, not wanting to be \\"tagged by one side or the other.\\" He attended the Beyond Belief symposium on November 2006. Ayala debated Christian apologist William Lane Craig in November 2009 on the topic of intelligent design. On October 18, 2011, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) announced that Professor Ayala would be donating $10 million to the university's School of Biological Sciences. The gift was to be \\"$1 million a year for the next decade.\\" Since 2013, Ayala has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education. =Sexual harassment investigation and resignation= In June 2018, UCI announced that it had investigated and confirmed the accusations of four women who claimed that Ayala had sexually harassed them. Ayala resigned, without becoming a professor emeritus, and the university removed his name from the School of Biological Sciences, Science Library, and endowed chairs that had been named after Ayala. The complete report of the investigation was made public (and then later removed at the request of people close to the case) on the website of the journal Science, detailing multiple incidents of gender-biased and inappropriate comments and actions towards female faculty and students. The American Association for the Advancement of Science removed his fellowship status because of his actions.  Awards and honors  In 2001, Ayala was awarded the National Medal of Science. On April 13, 2007, he was awarded the first of 100 bicentennial medals at Mount Saint Mary's University for lecturing there as the first presenter for the Bicentennial Distinguished Lecture Series. His lecture was entitled \\"The Biological Foundations of Morality\\". Other awards he has received include the Gold Honorary Gregor Mendel Medal of the Czech Academy of Sciences, the Gold Medal of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, the Gold Medal of the Stazione Zoologica in Naples, the President's Award of the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award and 150th Anniversary Leadership Medal of the AAAS, the Medal of the College of France, the UCI Medal of the University of California, the 1998 Distinguished Scientist Award from the SACNAS, and Sigma Xi's William Procter Prize for Scientific Achievement, 2000. In 2010, he was awarded the Templeton Prize. The science library at UCI was named after him from 2010 to 2018, when his name was removed after substantiated allegations of sexual harassment. Ayala delivered a lecture at the Trotter Prize ceremony in 2011 entitled \\"Darwin's Gift to Science and Religion.\\" In 2014, UCI named its School of Biological Sciences the Francisco J. Ayala School of Biological Sciences after Ayala. UCI removed his name from the library and school in 2018, after finding that he sexually harassed at least four women. Ayala was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. He is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He is also a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Rome, the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences, the Mexican Academy of Sciences, and the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He has honorary degrees from the University of Athens, the University of Bologna, the University of Barcelona, the University of the Balearic Islands, the University of Le√≥n, the University of Madrid, the University of Salamanca, the University of Valencia, the University of Vigo, Far Eastern National University, Masaryk University and University of Warsaw.

Biography  He was born in Granada. At the age of 16 he went to Madrid, where he studied Law and Humanities. During those years he published his first two novels, Tragicomedia de un hombre sin esp√≠ritu (Tragicomedy of a Spiritless Man) and Historia de un amanecer (A Sunrise Tale). He got a Ph.D. in Laws at the Universidad de Madrid, where he would also be a teacher. A post-graduate grant allowed him to go to Berlin to study philosophy and sociology from 1929 to 1931, during the advent of Nazism. There, he met the Chilean Etelvina Silva Vargas, whom he married in 1931 and with whom he would later have a daughter, Nina. He was a frequent contributor to the ' and Gaceta Literaria. At the beginning of the Republic he became a lawyer for the Parliament. He was lecturing in South America when the Spanish Civil War erupted; he worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the war. During the Spanish Civil War his father and his younger brother Rafael were killed by the Nationalists.Obituary in The Guardian When the Republican side lost the war, he exiled in Buenos Aires, where he spent ten years. There he worked for the literary magazine Sur, the newspaper La Naci√≥n and the publisher Losada. He also founded, along with fellow Spaniard Lorenzo Luzuriaga, the magazine Realidad. During the '50s he moved to Puerto Rico, where he would teach at the Law school in the University of Puerto Rico, invited by Dean Manuel Rodr√≠guez Ramos. He later went to the United States, where he taught Spanish Literature at the Universities of Princeton, Rutgers, New York and Chicago, though he kept close intellectual and cultural bounds with Puerto Rico, where other noted Spaniards, such as Pablo Casals and Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, were also exiled. He returned to Spain first in 1960. From that year onwards he would return every summer and bought a house there, rejoining literary life. In 1976, after Franco's death, he moved to Madrid for good, where he continued his work as a writer, lecturer and journalist. In 1983, at the age of 77, he was elected for the Real Academia Espa√±ola. He kept on writing to a very old age. In 1988 he received the Premio Nacional de las Letras Espa√±olas. In 1991 he received the Miguel de Cervantes Prize and, in 1998, the Prince of Asturias Award in Literature. Career Critics have usually divided Ayala's work in two stages: before and after the Spanish Civil War. During his first stage, before the Civil War, Tragicomedia de un hombre sin esp√≠ritu (Tragicomedy of a Spiritless Man, 1925) and Historia de un amanecer (A Sunrise Tale, 1926) follow a traditional narrative line. With El boxeador y el √°ngel (The Boxer and the Angel, 1929) and Cazador en el alba (Hunter at Dawn, 1930) he embraced avant-garde prose. Both tale collections feature a metaphorical style, stylistically brilliant, with a lack of interest in the anecdotical and a fascination for the modern world. After a long silence, Ayala begun his second stage in exile with El hechizado (The Bewitched, 1944), a tale of a Creole man trying to meet King Charles II of Spain (known as the Bewitched), which became part of Los usurpadores (The Usurpers, 1949), a collection of seven narrations with the common theme of lust for power. The story is used here as a reflection on the past, in order to better know the present. Ayala gets closer here to Kafka's existential and absurd world, including an implicit critic to the inmorality and stupidity of power. La cabeza del cordero (The Lamb Head, 1949) is a collection of tales on the Civil War, where he pays more attention to the analysis of passions and human behaviour than to the relation of outside developments. Muertes de perro (Dog Deaths, 1958) denounced the situation of a country under a dictatorship, while presenting human degradation in a world with no values. El fondo del vaso (The Bottom of the Glass, 1962) complements his previous novel, which is commented by several characters. Irony becomes a central resource in this work, though a greater understanding for the human being replaces contempt. After these novels, Ayala kept publishing short tales, such as those collected in El As de Bastos (The Ace of Staves, 1963), El rapto (The Kidnap, 1965), and El jard√≠n de las delicias (The Garden of Earthly Delights, 1971). The latest features a contrast between the satyric objectivity in the first part, Diablo mundo (Devil World), and the evocative, subjective and lyrical tone in the second, D√≠as felices (Happy Days). These works were followed by De triunfos y penas (Of Triumph and Sorrow, 1982) and El jard√≠n de las malicias (The Garden of Earthly Malice, 1988), where he collected six tales written at different times in his life. Ayala was also a prolific essay writer, covering political and social aspects, as well as reflections on Spain's past and present, cinema and literature. He wrote his memoirs, Recuerdos y olvidos (Reminiscences and Overlooks, 1982, 1983, 1988, 2006). He was a member of the Academia de Buenas Letras de Granada. In November 2003 he was proclaimed Honorary Fellow of the association Granada Hist√≥rica at his birthplace. He mentioned that was \\"maybe, one of the most beautiful moments in the last stage of my life because, after nearly a century of feeling a granadino across the world, now I feel recognised by the granadinos themselves\\". His short story El Tajo (The Tagus) was included in Partes de guerra (War Reports), an anthology of tales about the Spanish Civil War by Spanish writer Ignacio Mart√≠nez de Pis√≥n. He was a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1997. In 2007 he became the first donor for the Caja de las Letras (Letter Vault) of the Instituto Cervantes. Francisco Ayala died in Madrid, 3 November 2009, at the age of 103. He was cremated at the San Isidro cemetery in Madrid. He was survived by his second wife, scholar and translator Carolyn Richmond.Francisco Ayala, a Spanish Novelist and Literary Scholar, Dies at 103  Works = Narrative = * Tragicomedia de un hombre sin esp√≠ritu (1925). * Historia de un amanecer (1926). * El boxeador y un √°ngel (1929). * Cazador en el alba (1930). * El hechizado (1944). * Los usurpadores (1949). * La cabeza del cordero (1949). * Historia de macacos (1955). * Muertes de perro (1958). * El fondo del vaso (1962). * El as de Bastos (1963). * Mis mejores p√°ginas (1965). * El rapto (1965). * Cuentos (1966). * Obras narrativas completas.

Biography Badal Roy was born into a Hindu family in a predominantly Muslim eastern Bengal region in Comilla, British India in 1945 (which later became East Pakistan, then Bangladesh).Drum Magazine He speaks the Bengali, English, Hindi, and Urdu languages. His father was a government official who served in the distinguished position of Joint Secretary. His nickname, Badal (meaning \\"rain,\\" \\"cloud,\\" or \\"thunder\\" in the Bengali language), was given to him by his grandfather after he began crying in the rain as a baby. An early inspiration for Roy was American popular music, and he particularly enjoyed the music of artists such as Elvis Presley, Pat Boone, and Nat King Cole. His first exposure to jazz came when he saw a concert by Duke Ellington and his 60-member orchestra at the Metropole Hotel in Karachi, West Pakistan in 1959; he and his brother were the only Pakistanis in attendance (the rest of the audience was white). Roy received a master's degree in statistics. He came to New York City in 1968 to work on a PhD With only eight dollars in his pocket, he began working as a busboy and waiter in various Indian restaurants, including Taste of India and Raga. He later settled in East Brunswick Township, New Jersey.\\"Play it Again, Badal Roy\\", India Abroad, 10 September 2004. Accessed 26 June 2008. \\"But last week, Roy, an East Brunswick, New Jersey-based tabla player, who has performed with the likes of Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Yoko Ono, was part of the tournament's opening night act.\\" Musical career Roy began playing the tabla at age 10 or 11, under guidance from his maternal uncle in Comilla. After coming to New York, he began performing with Steve Gorn at a Manhattan restaurant called Raga, eventually attracting the attention of Miles Davis. Davis invited Roy to join his group, and he recorded on Davis's albums On the Corner (1972), Big Fun (1969‚Äì72; released 1974), and Get Up with It (1970‚Äì74). Roy subsequently performed and recorded with many leading jazz musicians, including Davis, Dave Liebman, Pharoah Sanders, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, Herbie Mann, Pat Metheny, Lester Bowie, Airto Moreira, Charlie Haden, Purna Das Baul, Yoko Ono, and Ornette Coleman (playing in Coleman's electric band Prime Time). In the 1990s Roy began performing with the Brazilian guitar duo Duofel. He has also collaborated with Ken Wessel and Stomu Takeishi in a fusion trio named Alankar. They currently have one album entitled Daybreak. Roy has appeared and offered workshops at RhythmFest, the Starwood Festival, and at the SpiritDrum Festival,SpiritDrum Festival Website a special tribute to the late Babatunde Olatunji (co-sponsored by ACE and Musart) with Muruga Booker, Jim Donovan of Rusted Root, Halim El-Dabh, Richie \\"Shakin'\\" Nagan, Jeff Rosenbaum and Sikiru Adepoju, among others.Muruga Booker Website He often plays with Muruga Booker in the Global Village Ceremonial Band, and with Michael Wolff & Impure Thoughts. In 2004, Roy worked with Richie Havens on the album The Grace of the Sun. In the first half of 2006, Roy travelled to Japan to appear in a tribute for David Baker, his recently deceased recording engineer and friend. In addition to tabla, Roy also plays a variety of percussion instruments including shakers, bells, rain stick, and flexatone. His notable students include Geoffrey Gordon. In 2008, the album Miles From India, a tribute to Miles Davis on which Roy appeared, received a Grammy nomination.Recalling Miles Davis by Crossing Cultures by Nate Chinen ‚Äì New York Times, 12 May 2008 Musical style Unlike many tabla players, Roy does not come from a family of professional musicians and is essentially self-taught, although he studied with his late maternal uncle Dwijendra Chandra Chakraborty as a child, and also studied briefly with Alla Rakha. Consequently, his playing is freer than that of many other tabla players, who adhere more strictly to the tala system of Indian rhythm. He often plays a set of up to eight tabla (tuned to different pitches) and two baya at a time, which he plays melodically as well as rhythmically.

It is the predominant flavanone in grapefruit, and is found in a variety of fruits and herbs.  Structure  Naringenin has the skeleton structure of a flavanone with three hydroxy groups at the 4', 5, and 7 carbons. It may be found both in the aglycol form, naringenin, or in its glycosidic form, naringin, which has the addition of the disaccharide neohesperidose attached via a glycosidic linkage at carbon 7. Like the majority of flavanones, naringenin has a single chiral center at carbon 2, although the optical purity is variable. Racemization of S(-)-naringenin has been shown to occur fairly quickly.  Sources and bioavailability Naringenin and its glycoside has been found in a variety of herbs and fruits, including grapefruit, bergamot, sour orange, tart cherries, tomatoes, cocoa, Greek oregano, water mint, as well as in beans. Ratios of naringenin to naringin vary among sources, as do enantiomeric ratios. The naringenin-7-glucoside form seems less bioavailable than the aglycol form. Grapefruit juice can provide much higher plasma concentrations of naringenin than orange juice. Also found in grapefruit is the related compound kaempferol, which has a hydroxyl group next to the ketone group. Naringenin can be absorbed from cooked tomato paste. There is 253 mg of naringenin in 10 grams of tomato paste.  Biosynthesis and metabolism  It is derived from malonyl CoA and 4-coumaroyl CoA. The latter is derived from phenylalanine. The resulting tetraketide is acted on by chalcone synthase to give the chalcone that then undergoes ring-closure to naringenin. The enzyme naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase uses dimethylallyl diphosphate and (‚àí)-(2S)-naringenin to produce diphosphate and 8-prenylnaringenin. Cunninghamella elegans, a fungal model organism of the mammalian metabolism, can be used to study the naringenin sulfation. Potential biological effects= Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral = Naringenin has an antimicrobial effect on S. epidermidis, as well as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Escherichia coli. Further research has added evidence for antimicrobial effects against Lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella oralis, Prevotella melaninogencia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, as well as yeasts such as Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei. There is also evidence of antibacterial effects on H. pylori, though naringenin has not been shown to have any inhibition on urease activity of the microbe. Naringenin has also been shown to reduce hepatitis C virus production by infected hepatocytes (liver cells) in cell culture. This seems to be secondary to naringenin's ability to inhibit the secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein by the cells. The antiviral effects of naringenin are currently under clinical investigation. Reports of antiviral effects on polioviruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2 have also been made, though replication of the viruses has not been inhibited. = Anti-inflammatory = Despite evidence of anti-inflammatory activity of naringin, the anti-inflammatory activity of naringenin has been observed to be poor to nonexistent. = Antioxidant = Naringenin has been shown to have significant antioxidant properties. It has been shown to reduce oxidative damage to DNA in vitro and in animal studies. = Anticancer = Cytotoxicity has been induced reportedly by naringenin in cancer cells from breast, stomach, liver, cervix, pancreas, and colon tissues, along with leukaemia cells. The mechanisms behind inhibition of human breast carcinoma growth have been examined, and two theories have been proposed. The first theory is that naringenin inhibits aromatase, thus reducing growth of the tumor. The second mechanism proposes that interactions with estrogen receptors is the cause behind the modulation of growth. New derivatives of naringenin were found to be active against multidrug-resistant cancer. Additional reading *inhibitory effect on the human cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2] resulting in carcinogens of otherwise harmless substances.  * *Naringenin also produces BDNF-dependent antidepressant-like effects in mice. Naringenin has been reported to induce apoptosis in preadipocytes. *Naringenin seems to protect LDLR-deficient mice from the obesity effects of a high-fat diet. *Naringenin lowers the plasma and hepatic cholesterol concentrations by suppressing HMG-CoA reductase and ACAT in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. *Naringenin has been demonstrated to improve memory and reduce amyloid and tau proteins in a study using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

NEBS is the most common set of safety, spatial and environmental design guidelines applied to telecommunications equipment in the United States. It is an industry requirement, but not a legal requirement. NEBS was developed by Bell Labs in the 1970s to standardize equipment that would be installed in a central office. The objective was to make it easier for a vendor to design equipment compatible with a typical Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) central office (CO). This would result in lower development costs and ease the equipment's introduction into the network. Telcordia now manages the NEBS specifications. The four then-largest US Telecommunications companies (AT&T;, Verizon, BellSouth, and CenturyLink) created the Telecommunications Carrier Group (TCG), a group formed to synchronize NEBS standards across the industry in the US. The TCG checklist specifies the individual NEBS requirements of each of its members in a matrix, making it simple to compare them. Levels \\"NEBS Level 1\\" means a very low threshold of equipment hazards and network degradation. NEBS Level 1 addresses the personnel and equipment safety requirements of GR-63-CORE and GR-1089-CORE. Operability requirements are not enforced for NEBS Level 1 certification. It is primarily used for getting prototypes into lab trials. RBOCs require all equipment deployed by CLECs to be NEBS Level 1 certified. \\"NEBS Level 2\\" addresses equipment operability in a controlled environment (usually datacenters) that will not be subjected to environmental stress. Because of ambiguity, this level of certification is rarely (if ever) used. \\"NEBS Level 3\\" is a term from Bellcore special report, SR-3580, and means the equipment meets all of the requirements of GR-63-CORE and GR-1089-CORE. NEBS Level 3 has strict specifications for fire suppression, thermal margin testing, vibration resistance (earthquakes), airflow patterns, acoustic limits, failover and partial operational requirements (such as chassis fan failures), failure severity levels, RF emissions and tolerances, and testing/certification requirements. NOTE: # Verizon and AT&T; do not follow NEBS Level 3 or SR-3580. They use their own NEBS checklist, Verizon Checklist (in MS Word format) and AT&T; Checklist, that details what they believe are important to their network's integrity. Both accept the TCG Checklist that can be found at those websites. Physical protection of equipment NEBS contains the key industry requirements for how to design and build reliable electronics for telecom network use. It is unique in its focus on telecommunications applications and environments for electronic systems. The proper design, engineering, manufacturing, and workmanship of equipment are critical for long-term use in all environments. For physical protection, good engineering practices cover metal surface treatment and contact compatibility, flammability ratings, component marking and traceability, electrical and mechanical integrity, and a variety of process manufacturing issues. The RBOCs often require that detail design selection and implementation take into account the various elements of NEBS GR-78, Generic Requirements for the Physical Design and Manufacture of Telecommunications Products and Equipment GR-78 has requirements that cover details of design implementation that need to be discussed, reviewed, and implemented, as appropriate, in equipment intended to be NEBS compliant. Topics include, but are not limited to, materials and finishes; electrostatic discharge requirements; printed wiring boards and assemblies; connectors, wire, and cable; product marking and identification; and qualification test procedures. GR-78 also clarifies the industry position on the use of Lead (Pb)-free solder and allows for alternative finishes such as immersion silver, etc.  References  Category:History of telecommunications in the United States ","title":"Network Equipment-Building System"},{"id":"2282117","text":"The NWA Continental Heavyweight Championship was a major title in the National Wrestling Alliance's Alabama territory called Southeastern Championship Wrestling.

In severe cases, the growth can encircle the bones, giving ringbone its name. It has been suggested by some authors that such a colloquial term, whilst commonly used, might be misleading and that it would be better to refer to this condition as osteoarthritis of the inter-phalangeal joints in ungulates (Rogers and Waldron, 1995: 34-35). Ringbone can be classified by its location, with \\"high ringbone\\" occurring on the lower part of the large pastern bone or the upper part of the small pastern bone. \\"Low ringbone\\" occurs on the lower part of the small pastern bone or the upper part of the coffin bone. High ringbone is easier seen than low ringbone, as low ringbone occurs in the hoof of the horse. However, low ringbone may be seen if it becomes serious, as it creates a bony bump on the coronet of the horse. Causes * Excessive tension on the tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules of the pastern area can strain the periosteum. The body compensates by growing bone at the stresspoint. Strain on the extensor tendon, the superficial digital flexor tendon branches, the collateral ligaments, and the distal sesamoidean ligaments are all common factors. If these tissues are stretched or torn, and the joint is instabilized by the injury, new bone is produced to help to stabilize the joint. * Osteoarthritis (the endstage of degenerative joint disease) of the pastern or coffin joint is a very common cause of articular ringbone. Bone is then produced to try to immobilize the joint and to relieve the chronic inflammation of the joint capsule. This process may take years, and lameness will continue until the joint is completely immobilized. * Trauma to the periosteum can cause bone growth on the pastern bone. However, this is usually not progressive unless nearby soft tissue was also harmed and thus the joint instability was affected. * Poor shoeing and conformation, such as long, sloping pasterns, upright pasterns, long-toes with low heels, pigeon toes, splay foot, or unbalanced feet may predispose the horse to ringbone, as they create uneven stress on the pastern and coffin joint, unequal tension on the soft tissues, or worsen the concussion that is absorbed by the pastern area. Signs Ringbone usually occurs in the front legs but can also be in the hind legs, and is usually worse in one leg than the other. Ringbone is most often found in mature horses, especially those in intensive training. High ringbone: The horse will have a bony growth around the pastern area, and the pastern will have less mobility. The horse will show pain when the pastern joint is moved or rotated. Early cases will have a lameness score of 1-2 out of 5, with little or no bony swelling seen, although possibly felt when compared to the opposite pastern. Lameness will worsen to a grade 2-3 on a scale of 5 as the ringbone worsens. Low ringbone: The horse will have moderate lameness (grade 2-3), even in early cases, because of the closeness of the ringbone to the other structures in the hoof. When severe or very advanced, the bony growth will be able to be seen on the coronet. Treatment Ringbone is degenerative (unless it is caused by direct trauma). Treatment works to slow down the progress of the bony changes and alleviate the horse's pain, rather than working to cure it. Shoeing: The farrier should balance the hoof and apply a shoe that supports the heels and allows for an easy breakover. NSAIDs: or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help to alleviate the pain and reduce inflammation within and around the joints. Often NSAIDs make the horse comfortable enough to continue ridden work, which is good for the horse's overall health. Joint injections: The pastern joint can be injected directly, typically with a form of corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: A high intensity specialized percussion device can help to remodel new bone tissue and decrease pain. Arthrodesis: the fusion of the two bones of the pastern joints eliminates the instability of the joint, and thus the inflammation. This procedure may then eliminate the horse's lameness as well. However, surgical alteration of the joint can promote the growth of bone in the area, which is cosmetically displeasing. Arthrodesis of the coffin joint is usually not performed due to the location of the joint (within the hoof) and because the coffin joint needs some mobility for the horse to move correctly (unlike the pastern joint, which is very still). Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) blocks IL-1 from binding to tissues and inhibits the damaging consequences of IL-1. Microcurrent technology: Tissue, including muscle, tendons, ligaments, skin and bone, is formed from a large mass of similar cells that perform specific functions. These cells use tiny sequences of electric current, measured in millionths of an amp, to organise, monitor and regulate a stable state within the body. When there is injury, damage or disease to a tissue, there is disruption to the normal electrical current within the cells and things fail to work properly. By introducing the correct sequences the body's natural electric circuitry is replicated and kick starts and accelerates normal functioning. Prognosis If the ringbone is close to a joint, the prognosis for the horse's continued athletic use is not as good as if the ringbone is not near a joint. Ringbone that is progressing rapidly has a poorer prognosis as well. Horses that are not performing strenuous work, such as jumping or working at speed, will probably be usable for years to come. However, horses competing in intense sports may not be able to continue at their previous level, as their pastern joints are constantly stressed.

Legend In Virgil's account of Dido's founding of Carthage, when Dido and her party were encamped at Byrsa, the local Berber chieftain offered them as much land as could be covered with a single oxhide. Therefore, Dido cut an oxhide into tiny strips and set them on the ground end to end until she had completely encircled the hilltop of Byrsa (, \\"oxhide\\"). History The citadel dominated the city below and formed the principal military installation of Carthage. Its name appeared on Carthaginian currency under the form (). It was besieged by Scipio Aemilianus Africanus in the Third Punic War when the city was defeated and destroyed in 146. The Byrsa citadel was the seat of the proconsul of Africa within the Roman Empire. In 439, Geiseric took possession of Carthage. The Vandal kings ruled North Africa from the Byrsa until the Byzantine emperor Justinian reconquered the province in 533. StLouis Cathedral was built on Byrsa Hill starting in 1884, atop an ancient temple. Today, it serves as a cultural centre. Byrsa Hill itself is part of the archaeological site of Carthage. In addition to a cathedral monument, the Carthage National Museum was erected atop it. Archaeology In 1994, the body of an ancient Carthaginian individual was excavated from a 2500-year-old Punic tomb in Byrsa Hill. In 2016, he was found to belong to the rare U5b2c1 maternal haplogroup.

U≈üak carpets, Ushak carpets or Oushak Carpets () are Turkish carpets that use a particular family of designs, called by convention after the city of U≈üak, Turkey - one of the larger towns in Western Anatolia, which was a major center of rug production from the early days of the Ottoman Empire, into the early 20th century (although these patterns were woven in other regions also).King & Sylvester, 70 and 73  Classification  Historically Ushaks were classified as ‚ÄòAnatolian Rugs,‚Äô Anatolian literally translating to ‚Äòland of the rising sun.‚Äô Today scholars know much more about Oushaks and are able to classify them as such. ‚ÄòAnatolian‚Äô is used as a last resort when a more specific identification cannot be found; at which point ‚ÄòAnatolian‚Äô refers to a carpet made in Turkey. The level of international popularity attained by U≈üak's carpets became such that the word \\"Ushak\\" is considered an English word of Turkic origin Merriam- Webster Unabridged - Ushak A heavy woolen oriental rug tied in Ghiordes knots and characterized by bright primary colors and an elaborate medallion pattern. = In the European market = In the European markets, the earlier types of Turkish carpets, before the \\"star\\" type, are now often called \\"Lotto carpets\\" and \\"Holbein carpets\\". The terms make reference to their depiction in minute detail in paintings by Lorenzo Lotto and Hans Holbein the Younger, in which they are often placed in a way to brighten the background, and suggest status.Other types of rugs were also named after examples seen in paintings, such as Crivelli rugs. See King & Sylvester throughout The region of U≈üak still remains a vibrant center of hand-made carpet weaving today. = In the United States Market = There are many Turkish rugs companies in the US Market. They manufacture carpets and rugs in Turkey and distribute them to US market through major retailers and online channels. Most of the rugs are machine made yet designed with a traditional Ushak look.A classic antique Oushak. Four sinuous dragons rotate about the center of the rich apricot field, while above and below them winged lions pounce on larger fantastic creatures.  History of market popularity  After the 17th century, Ushaks (Ovshaks), development of Oushak rug weaving is less well known. Late 17th century saw a decline in the Oriental rug market as European consumers tended to purchase rugs of European origin ‚Äì primarily Aubusson, Savonnerie and Axminster. The wane in the European market meant that Ovshak production declined. Those that were still made throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries were manufactured for upper-class people in the Turkish territories on Eastern Europe. Towards the end of the 19th century, when the European market began to be interested in Persian carpets once again, the Ushak (Ovshak) population did not have enough weavers still skilled in the traditional Ovshak craft. Manufactories had to turn to neighboring villages and their craftsmen who still maintained traditional techniques. Ushak carpets, particularly those known as Lotto carpets, are among the later types of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting, as they were imported by Europeans, where they adorned cathedrals, churches, and the homes of the wealthy and powerful.King & Sylvester, 70-75  Design  Antique Oushak carpet The artistic knotting techniques of the Oushak produce a unique carpet. Ushak (Oushak) rugs are some of the finest Oriental Rugs, so much so that many of the masterpieces of the 15th and 16th centuries have been attributed to Oushak. The popular star and medallion carpets originated in Oushak. Oushak rugs are known for the silky, luminous wool they work with. The dyes tend towards: cinnamons, terracotta tints, gold, blues, greens, ivory, saffron and grays. The late 19th century saw the rejuvenation of Oriental rug production, at this time Oushak re-surfaced as a preeminent center of weaving industry. The new Oushak industry saw two major shifts in design: floral patterns in the Persian tradition were incorporated into design and room size, decorative carpets were woven as European standards demanded. The late 19th century weavers came from villages outside of Oushak and employed tribal techniques. Paramount to these techniques was the use of larger knots (sometimes less than 30 knots per square inch) and an all-wool foundation. The tribal style fused with the older Ushak/Smyra designs. The merger of the two styles created a new style simply known as late 19th/early 20th century Oushak carpets. The new decorative Oushak, commercially woven, employed a soft red, as its primary color offsetting the large-scale floral motifs from the field in a bright blue.9 The luxurious quality of the wool (for which Oushaks had always been known) aided the colors luminosity.  Istanbul mosques and Ushak carpets  Approximately 40 years ago anthropologists did a study on the carpets of the larger mosques of Istanbul (such as the Sultan Ahmet Mosque). What they found was that the floors were covered with hundreds of carpets (sometimes several deep) almost exclusively from the Oushak region.  Notes  References  * Campbell, Gordon.

It was written and directed by Gregory Widen in his feature directorial debut, and is the first motion picture of The Prophecy series including four sequels. The film tells the story of the Archangel Gabriel (Walken) and his search for an evil soul on Earth, and a police detective (Koteas) who unknowingly becomes caught in the middle of an angelic civil war.  Plot  Thomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: Simon briefly enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, while Usiel, a lieutenant of the Archangel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of recently deceased Korean War veteran Colonel Arnold Hawthorne, and a thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds Hawthorne awaiting burial and sucks his soul out of his body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Usiel's body has no eyes, no bones, hermaphroditism, and the blood chemistry of a fetus. His personal effects include an ancient Bible, with an expanded Book of Revelation that describes a second war in Heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon. Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches a disappointed Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death. Jerry retrieves Usiel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Usiel's body in the morgue. Finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is cared for by her teacher, Katherine. After finding Usiel's burnt body, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it, and a win for the rebellious angels would make Heaven like Hell with Earth in its thrall. Gabriel tortures Simon, but he refuses to reveal its location, so Gabriel kills him. Mary shows signs of possession by Hawthorne, recounting an incident from Hawthorne's harrowing war experiences in first-person perspective. Meanwhile, Thomas examines Simon's remains and questions Katherine. In Hawthorne's home, he finds evidence of war crimes. Thomas visits a church to reflect in and is shaken by a verbal confrontation with Gabriel. At school, Katherine finds Gabriel questioning the children. After he leaves, she rushes to Mary's home and finds Thomas. As Mary's condition worsens, Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she had seen Gabriel. They find angelic script and experience together a terrible vision of the angelic war. Returning to Mary, they find Gabriel and Jerry. Thomas kills Jerry, while Katherine distracts Gabriel when her wild gunshot misses him and blows up Mary's trailer home. They take Mary to a Native American site to be exorcised. In a hospital, Gabriel recruits a new unwilling assistant, Rachael, just as she dies of a terminal illness. Lucifer confronts Katherine and tells her that \\"other angels\\" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to enter Heaven. He knows Gabriel plans to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obedient angels. He also knows that if Gabriel wins the war under his influence Heaven will ultimately devolve into another Hell, which Lucifer considers \\"one Hell too many\\". Lucifer then appears to Thomas and advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith against him. When Gabriel arrives and attempts to disrupt the exorcism ritual, Thomas kills Rachael, and he and Katherine fight Gabriel. Gabriel defeats them and moves to kill Katherine. Lucifer appears, encouraging the Natives to complete the exorcism. Lucifer confronts Gabriel, telling him that his war is based upon arrogance, which is evil, making it Lucifer's territory. Lucifer tells Gabriel he needs to go home and rips out his heart. Simultaneously Mary expels out Hawthorne's soul. The \\"enemy ghost\\" starts to attack Thomas and Katherine, but a bright light from Heaven appears and destroys it. Lucifer asks Thomas and Katherine to \\"come home\\" with him, but they refuse. Lucifer drags Gabriel to Hell. As morning comes, Thomas comments on the nature of faith and what it means to truly be human.

The critical consensus reads: \\"The Prophecy has its moments, but any fantasy thriller starring Christopher Walken as a murderous angel should be a good deal more engaging than this.\\" Eric Hansen of Variety called it \\"daring and unique on the one hand, but hard to swallow on the other\\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film is bad enough to end the recent proliferation of religious thrillers. David Kronke of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Though Widen proves himself capable enough behind the camera, his script here is simply too loopy for him to render it in any credible fashion.\\" Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"Yet for all its goofiness, director Widen has made a film with some genuinely creepy moments.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it D‚àí and described it as \\"an occult freakshow so inert it seems to have been pasted together out of stock footage\\". It has since gone on to become a cult film.  Sequels  The film spawned four direct-to-video sequels: The Prophecy II (1998), The Ascent (2000), Uprising (2005) and Forsaken (2005).  Soundtrack  The film score by David C. Williams was released on Perseverance Records August 7, 2006. The song \\"Breakin' Down\\" by heavy metal band Skid Row plays over the closing credits. Other pop songs featured include Angel In Black by Shawn Amos, Surf N' Turf by Dennis Michael Tenney, and Your Best Friend by Peter Bear.

Local Vietnamese refer to it as Ch·ª£ L·ªõn, while local Vietnamese-Chinese refer it as Â†§Â≤∏ - Êñ∞Ë°óÂ∏Ç \\"The New Market of Ch·ª£ L·ªõn\\", and the Chinese other than those living in Vietnam known it only as Â†§Â≤∏ (Dƒ´'√†n, or literally, \\"embankment\\"). \\"The Old Market\\" () did exist in Cho Lon; it used to be on Nguyen Trai Street in District 5. It was destroyed in a raging fire (exact time unknown) and soon after, \\"The New Market\\" was built. Although it was used extensively before the fire, local people rarely mention about this lost market except the elderly, or ones who has lived nearby long enough to know the history of this old market.  Geography  Binh Tay Market is sitting on Thap Muoi Street (Vietnamese: ƒê∆∞·ªùng Th√°p M∆∞·ªùi), a four street- block span connecting Confucius Street (Vietnamese: ƒê∆∞·ªùng Kh·ªïng T·ª≠ - old French: Quai de Gaudot) to the North, and Hau Giang Street (Vietnamese: ƒê∆∞·ªùng H·∫≠u Giang) to the South, on the edge of District 6. It is the largest marketplace before the road leading West to Mien Tay of Vietnam, via a very important ground transportation hub named Xa C·∫£ng Mi·ªÅn T√¢y. Despite many wars over the years, Binh Tay Market has always been a major business hub not only for the local Vietnamese and Chinese, but also for the Vietnamese farmers trading daily goods coming from all directions of South Vietnam.  Little- known history  B√¨nh T√¢y Market was built, or at least heavily financially supported, by a Chinese businessman named Guoyan (ÈÉ≠Áê∞) better known as Qu√°ch ƒê√†m, (1863‚Äì1927), originally hailing from Chaozhou in Guangdong. Qu√°ch ƒê√†m operated his businesses under the trade name of Th√¥ng Hi·ªáp, but he was best known by his nickname \\"Handicapped Th√¥ng\\" among local Chinese. He started out very poor, making a living by recycling garbage and other used material; later, he began to enter into other types of businesses, in which he earned his fortune. There used to be a life-size bronze statue of Th√¥ng Hi·ªáp standing right in the center of the B√¨nh T√¢y Market, surrounded by four bronze lions, and four bronze dragons spitting water into the fountain under in which the statue of Th√¥ng was standing. The full size statue of Th√¥ng was replaced with a smaller glass altar sometime between 1976 and 1980 for unknown reasons. Nowadays, that statue is located in the Fine Art Museum of Ho Chi Minh city. The four bronze lions and dragons are still standing .

Following the Fatimid conquest of Egypt, he was dispatched to Nubia by the Fatimid governor Jawhar al-Siqilli in 975 AD (365 AH) or perhaps a little earlier.Adams (1991) dates his mission to between 969 and 973. He left a written record of his mission, the KitƒÅb AkhbƒÅr al-N≈´ba wa æl-Mu·∏≥urra wa  øAlwa wa æl-Buja wa æl-Nƒ´l (\\"Book of Reports on Nubia, Makuria, Alodia, the Beja and the Nile\\"). This is the only surviving eyewitness description of medieval Nubia other than the very brief account in Ibn ·∏§awqal. Jawhar, who had led the Fatimid conquest of Egypt, was apparently under the impression that the Nubians, who had previously resisted Islamization, might be persuaded to convert to Isma'ilism, the Islamic doctrine espoused by the Fatimids. He chose as his ambassador Abdallah ibn Ahmad ibn Salim from Aswan (the nisbah al-Aswani means \\"of Aswan\\") presumably because Aswan lay on Egypt's frontier with Nubia and so Abdallah could be presumed to have some familiarity with the country. Ibn Salim travelled through much of Lower Nubia with a large retinue. He celebrated Eid al-Adha with some sixty fellow Muslims. He stayed several months in Dongola, the capital of Makuria. There he persuaded King George II to resume payment of the ba·∏≥t, an annual tribute the Nubians had rendered to the Muslim rulers of Egypt since the seventh century. He failed, however, to persuade the king to convert to Islam, although he did engage in a debate at court. He also visited the southern kingdom of Alodia and describes its capital, Soba, in the KitƒÅb AkhbƒÅr al-N≈´ba. He does not appear to have visited the country of the Beja, however, and his descriptions of it are secondhand.Adams (1991) doubts that he visited Alodia, since his mission was to the court of Makuria and would have had no reason to travel on to Alodia. The record of Ibn Salim's voyage survives only as excerpts in al- Maqrizi and al-Manufi. The excerpts of al-Maqrizi are quoted and abridged in Ibn Iyas. The original complete work is lost. The KitƒÅb seems to have once circulated relatively widely, since it can be detected as a source in several works, such as that of Abu al-Makarim. The KitƒÅb is still one of the most important sources on medieval Nubia. He describes the geography, history and contemporary political situation of the bilƒÅd al-S≈´dƒÅn. He describes a quite centralized and prosperous Makurian state. Unlike many other Arab writers, he seems favourably disposed to the Christian kingdoms.

It was developed primarily for internal security or armed reconnaissance purposes. Modeled after Renault's V√©hicule de l'Avant Blind√© (VAB) armoured personnel carrier, the VBC-90 was engineered in concert with Saviem and Creusot-Loire. One was also built in prototype form by Argentina under license, where it was known as the Veh√≠culos de Apoyo y Exploraci√≥n.S√°nchez Rubio, Rodolfo.

VBC-90s were available with various chassis configurations resembling both the VAB and the Berliet VXB-170. Development History The VBC-90 was developed by Renault and Saviem as a specialized reconnaissance and fire support variant of the V√©hicule de l'Avant Blind√©. It had a very wide turret ring and was manufactured specifically to carry a large-calibre gun system. At least two prototypes had been completed by 1979 and were initially designated VCS-90. The first two had boat-shaped hulls and glacis plates reminiscent of the VXB-170 and VAB, respectively. They essentially resembled six-wheeled variants of these vehicles, albeit with larger turret rings. The third had a more unique hull and a sloping glacis plate. It was this variant which was eventually accepted for production as the VBC-90. Unlike the VAB, the VBC was not developed to meet a French Army requirement and was intended solely for export to French military clients overseas.Kolodziej, Edward A. \\"Making and Marketing Arms: The French Experience and Its Implications for the International System.\\" Princeton University Press, 2014. . pp 274‚Äì275. Nevertheless, from 1981, the French government ordered 28 VBC-90s for a single squadron of the Mobile Gendarmerie, as a replacement for the ageing AMX-13 light tanks. The last one was delivered in 1984. VBCs produced by Renault for the Gendarmerie were designated VBC-90G.Senat Avis: Premiere Session Ordinaire de 1986‚Äì1987 (Tome V) Another 6 were delivered to Oman between 1984 and 1985 as part of a much larger shipment of VABs for the Royal Omani Guard. Oman has since announced it will be phasing out its VBC-90s in favor of the much more heavily armed B1 Centauro. The French gendarmerie relegated its VBCs to reserve storage in the early 2000s. A simplified VBC-90 variant known as the Veh√≠culos de Apoyo y Exploraci√≥n (VAPE) was developed for Argentina by Renault. It was trialled alongside a much heavier model of the ERC 90 Sagaie offered by Panhard, but neither of the two were adopted by the Argentine Army. In 2014, Lebanon was lobbying for the purchase of an undisclosed number of VBC-90s. The deal was to be partly financed with military grants from Saudi Arabia but was frozen in 2016 due to tensions between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. Specifications It has a steel hull armoured to protect against small arms fire. It has a crew of three, with the driver sitting at the front of the vehicle with three bullet-proof windows provided for the driver. A GIAT TS 90 turret carries the commander and gunner, and carries an armament of a 90 mm cannon with a co-axial 7.62 mm machine gun. 20 rounds of 90 mm ammunition are carried in the turret, with a further 25 rounds in the hull. It is powered by a six-cylinder diesel engine mounted at the rear of the hull, driving a 6x6 drive. The vehicle is not amphibious, unlike the VAB on which it was based.

The book has sold over 13 million copies, has won several prizes for children's literature, and has been developed into plays on both the West End and Broadway and even an Oscar nominated animated film. The Gruffalo was initially published in 1999 in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Children's Books () as a 32-page hardback edition, was followed six months later by a paperback edition, and subsequently by a small-format board book edition. It was penned for readers aged three to seven, and is about 700 words long. It is written in rhyming couplets, featuring repetitive verse with minor variance. Plot The story of a mouse's walk through the woods unfolds in two phases; in both, the mouse uses clever tricks to evade danger. On his way the mouse encounters several dangerous animals (a fox, an owl, and a snake). Each of these animals, clearly intending to eat the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he has plans to dine with his friend, a \\"gruffalo\\", a monstrous creature whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal, and describes the features of the gruffalo's monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat it, each animal flees. Convinced the gruffalo is fictional, the mouse gloats thus: : Silly old fox/owl/snake, doesn't he know? : there's no such thing as a gruffalo! After getting rid of the last animal, the mouse is shocked to encounter a real gruffalo ‚Äì with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing. The gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse, but again the mouse is cunning: he tells the gruffalo that he, the mouse, is the scariest animal in the forest. Laughing, the gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse as he demonstrates how feared he is. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the animals that had earlier menaced the mouse. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off ‚Äì and each time the gruffalo becomes more impressed with the mouse's apparent toughness. Exploiting this, the mouse threatens to eat the gruffalo, which flees. The story is based on a Chinese folk tale of a fox that borrows the terror of a tiger. Donaldson was unable to think of rhymes for \\"tiger\\" so instead she invented a word that rhymes with \\"know\\".Information on Julia Donaldson, children's author and creator of The Gruffalo Recognition The Gruffalo won the gold award (in the 0‚Äì5 years category) of the 1999 Nestl√© Smarties Book Prize.

Belle Island is a small island near the southern end of the lake. It was given to the state of New Hampshire by Camp Mowglis, a boys' camp located near the northern end of the lake, in 1942. According to a plaque posted on a rock on the island, the camp, known as the School of the Open, gave the island to the state \\"to remain perpetually in its natural beauty for a camping area especially for residents of New Hampshire, but for anyone who wants to use it. Take good care of it,\\" the plaque reads.Photo showing text on the plaque There are a couple of popular sandbars on the lake. One is at the mouth of the Fowler River, just south of Wellington State Park. The other is in Hebron, by the mouth of the Cockermouth River, in the northwest corner of the lake. Name A questionable tradition says that the Native Americans called the lake \\"Pasquaney\\", meaning \\"the place where birch bark for canoes is found\\". In 1751, John Kendall and Jonathan Farwell participated in marking the western lands of the Masonian proprietors, where they referred to it as \\"Newfound Lake\\" or \\"Baker's Pond\\". Evidently this information did not get to Emmanuel Brown in time for publication of his New and Accurate Map of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England in 1752, as the lake was left nameless. In 1755, Thomas Jefferys published a Map of the Most Inhabited Parts of New England with the lake shown, but still without a name. In 1761, a map called the Accurate Map of his Majesty's Province of New Hampshire detailed the area, again with the lake nameless. In 1766 the New Chester proprietors refer to the lake in printed records as \\"Newfound pond\\". In 1791, Jeremy Belknap called it \\"New Chester Pond\\" in his History of New Hampshire. Bristol native Fred Lewis Pattee romantically referred to Newfound by its supposed Indian name in his poem \\"Pasquaney Lake\\". Original landowners The lake was originally fought over by John Mason and Peter Wheelright, who both claimed they owned a large plot of land with the lake being inside that plot. On November 7, 1629, Mason, a merchant from London, had the land from Newfound Lake to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts granted to him. Six months earlier, Reverend Peter Wheelright bought a large plot of land from native Indians that was similar to the land John Mason received. The argument went to court and lasted for more than one hundred years. Eventually, Mason's sixth heir, John Tufton Mason, won the case and sold the land to a syndicate known as the Masonian proprietors. On September 14, 1753, a syndicate living in Chester, New Hampshire, bought the land from the Mason proprietors, and the land became known as \\"New Chester\\". On February 12, 1788, the territory was divided up, and the territory north and east of Newfound Lake and the Newfound River was incorporated as Bridgewater. Two thirds of the lake was incorporated as Bristol on June 24, 1819. Fish In 1890, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Commissioner stocked 15,000 landlocked salmon into the Fowler River, and in 1898, the NH Fish and Game Commission stocked 40,000 whitefish from Lake Superior. In 1889, the state built a fish hatching house located on the Newfound River because of the \\"ease with which the trout could be dipped from the spawning beds and stripped of the spawn.\\" The house was and could hold 750,000 eggs. In 1897 a larger house was constructed, which held 1,000,000 lake trout eggs, 125,000 brook trout eggs, and 65,000 landlocked salmon eggs all in its first year of operation. After years of declining trout numbers, a screen was built at the outlet of the lake to prevent the fish from swimming down the Newfound River. Today, 22 species of fish are found in the Newfound Lake watershed: * Brook trout * Brown bullhead * Burbot * Chain pickerel * Common shiner * Creek chub * Eastern blacknose dace * Fallfish * Golden shiner * Lake trout * Landlocked salmon * Longnose dace * Margined madtom * Rainbow smelt * Rainbow trout * Redbreast sunfish * Rock bass * Round whitefish * Slimy sculpin * Smallmouth bass * White sucker * Yellow perch Of these species, six - brook trout, burbot, lake trout, rainbow smelt, round whitefish, and slimy sculpin - were selected as needing special consideration by the 2006 New Hampshire Wildlife Action Plan. Selection is based on a species' population status, integral ecological function, or the ability to extrapolate from it to indicate a healthy aquatic ecosystem. Every year between mid-March and early July the lake is stocked with additional fish. In 2011 this included 305 landlocked salmon, with a total weight of , and 1,845 rainbow trout weighing . Steamboats Newfound Lake has hosted multiple steamboats in its waters. The first, the Pioneer owned by Capt. George W. Dow, was placed in the lake in 1865. It was destroyed by fire. In 1878, Edward M. Drake put the Cardigan on the lake, which plied until 1883. That same year, the Lady Helen joined it, but was also destroyed in a fire. In May 1900, the Stella-Marion was launched at Kimball's beach. It freighted mail and passengers until it too was destroyed in a fire on September 2, 1915. Lighthouses Reed Lighthouse, built in 1932, is located on West Shore Road next to the Ledges. Newfound Lighthouse stands at the Paradise Point Lodge on Route 3A in Bridgewater. Lake conservation The Newfound Lake Region Association (NLRA) was created in 1971 to protect the waters of Newfound Lake and the surrounding land. A total of of land is currently in conservation.

Sold to developers in 1965, the estate is now divided between State and private ownership. Interiors thumb On the piano nobile there are a series of ever grander reception rooms typical of the 1720s. The house was entered by ascending a staircase outside before coming into a large entrance hall which was graced with stucco gilding and pictures of the family. To the left is the dining room which was made out of two smaller rooms. To the right of the hall was the huge staircase itself. This was made of Portland stone and is cantilevered. Straight on is the Green Drawing Room and was also known as the Saloon because of its position in the house. This was the room that the family used to receive their guests in before leaving and (staying on the left hand side of the house) entering the Red Drawing Room. The Print Room is decorated with cut-outs of favourite images, following the fashion of the 1760s. This room is on the right side and is thought to be the only surviving example of this in Ireland from this period. Further on is the State Bedroom, which was never used by royalty as such, but by the various viceroys based in Dublin. In it are chairs which were from Venice. Another feature of Castletown is the Long Gallery, an long room decorated in the Pompeian manner by O'Reilly in the 1770s in blue, red and gold. History=Early history= On William Conolly's death in 1729, his widow Katherine (n√©e Conyngham) continued living in the house and hosting extravagant entertainments there until her own death in 1752.Wilson, Rachel, Elite Women in Ascendancy Ireland, 1690-1745: Imitation and Innovation (Boydell and Brewer, Woodbridge, 2015). 978-1783270392 The Castletown estate then passed to Conolly's nephew William James Conolly, MP for Ballyshannon. On William James' death in 1754 it passed to his son Tom Conolly whose wife, Lady Louisa (great-granddaughter of Charles II of England and Louise de Keroualle), finished the interior decoration during the 1760s and 1770s. Lady Louisa had grown up in Carton House, a demesne to the north east of Castletown house. Much of the work on the interior was carried out to designs of William Chambers. She also did extensive work on the grounds; the paths through the forest are still in walking condition although, due to anti-joyrider measures, several of the culverts have broken and the pathways are again subject to flooding. The drainage scheme through the woodland is ingenious, creating dry paths for walking on land that is below the watertable. The ha-ha fence is part of this intricate network. When Tom died in 1803 he left the estate to his wife who on her own death in 1821 bequeathed it to her great-nephew, Edward Michael Pakenham, later the MP for Donegal, on condition he adopted the surname of Conolly. He was succeeded by his eldest son, another Tom Conolly, the eccentric MP for Donegal from 1849 to 1876. Tom's eldest son Thomas inherited Castletown, but after he was killed in 1900 the estate passed to his brother Major Edward Conolly. The Conolly family continued to live in their ancestral house, latterly as the Conolly-Carews, until 1965, when it was sold by The 6th Baron Carew, along with its collections and land, to a Major Wilson for ¬£133,000. Some of the land has been built on, although with some of the estate's features retained amongst the new structures. =Desmond Guinness and the Castletown Foundation= The house was bought in 1967 by Mariga and Desmond Guinness for ¬£93,000 to save it from vandalism, became the flagship of the Irish Georgian Society, and was eventually handed over to the newly established Castletown Foundation. The estate was sold on in parts, with held as curtilage around the house, some small quantities retained privately by Desmond Guinness, the forested Crodaun Woods part sold to what became Coillte and around acquired over time by Kildare County Council. Most of the core estate remains as woods or green space but a large fraction in the south west was developed as Castletown Estate, controversially approaching the main house closely, and taking in the Walled Garden and the orchard (whose wall remains), which were lost. However, some other features, such as the Gazebo, the Steward's House and a mock temple, were retained, after negotiations between developer Janus Securities and the Irish Georgian Society. =Modern times= The charitable Castletown Foundation struggled with the financial and operational demands of maintenance and ongoing restoration, and in 1994, following extensive negotiations between the foundation and the State, Castletown House, with its 120-acre residual demesne, was transferred to the Office of Public Works (OPW). The OPW continued the programme of restoration, of both house and lands. Across the broader former estate, and despite the protection of the house and some estate features, at least one of the outlying features, The Gazebo, was partly demolished, without planning permission, in late 2007.*Gazebo photos An enforcement notice was served on the developer concerned, and further action is expected.Background on Castletown estate and the damage to the Gazebo In 2012, work began to restore the lake on the lawn between Castletown House and the Liffey, and this was followed in 2016 by work on the pleasure grounds behind and to the west of the house. Current activities Castletown House has opened its doors to various academic and artistic organisations. The first arts organisation to take up residency at Castletown House in 2007 was The Performance Corporation, an Irish site- specific theatre company. The company operates an office from the premises as well as running rehearsals for their productions and hosting an annual international cross-artform residency programme, the SPACE Programme. The OPW- Maynooth University Archive and Research Centre was launched by President Mary McAleese in November 2008. It was established to facilitate the care and study of archives and other sources dealing with the history of Irish estates, their houses and inhabitants. It also facilitates research in the decorative arts. This facility marks an exciting new collaboration between the Office of Public Works and Maynooth University. The Archive and Research Centre is located on the second floor of Castletown House. A weekly parkrun takes place in the parklands of Castletown house every Saturday. Former St Patrick's Athletic F.C. and current Kerry goalkeeping coach Mick O'Shea is the current caretaker of Castletown House. Access and rights of way Access by pedestrians is possible from Celbridge along the former half-mile main drive lined with lime trees. Access by car is from the north beside junction 6 of the N4 / M4 motorway, with a car park near the house. An informal footpath runs along the river Liffey, and a second path runs from the house towards Leixlip, passing the gate lodge designed by Batty Langley.

It stars Ronald Mlodzik, who also appears in Cronenberg's Crimes of the Future, Shivers and Rabid. It was Cronenberg's first feature-length effort, following his two short films, Transfer and From the Drain. It is a brief feature film, with a running time of a little over one hour. The film has a 60% 'fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Summary The film purports to be part of a \\"mosaic\\" of educational resources by the Canadian Academy of Erotic Enquiry. It documents an experiment by the unseen Dr. Luther Stringfellow. A young man (Ronald Mlodzik) in a black cloak is seen arriving at the Academy, where he joins a group of young volunteers who are being endowed with telepathic abilities which they are encouraged to develop through sexual exploration. It is hoped that telepathic groups, bonded in polymorphous sexual relationships, will form a socially stabilising replacement for the \\"obsolescent family unit\\". One girl develops a secondary personality in order to cope with her new state of consciousness, which gradually ousts her original personality. As the volunteers' abilities develop, the experimenters find themselves increasingly unable to control the progress of the experiment. They decide to separate the telepaths, which results in two suicides. The final sequence shows the young woman who developed an extra personality wearing the black cloak. CastProduction The film was shot in black and white, and silent because the Bolex camera Cronenberg was using made too much noise. A commentary, purportedly by various followers of Stringfellow's theories, and parodying scientific and metaphysical jargon, was added later. The film was shot at Scarborough College (University of Toronto). Analysis The film embodies several themes now common within Cronenberg's body of work. The exploration (voluntary or otherwise) of new states of consciousness via sexual experimentation is a major theme in Shivers, Videodrome, Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch, M. Butterfly and Crash. The idea of telepathy induced by an unknown scientist recurs in Scanners, as does the image of one tormented telepath who uses an electric drill to pierce his own forehead in what Stereo's commentary refers to as \\"an act of considerable symbolic significance\\". Home video The film has been included as a special feature in multiple releases of other Cronenberg films, including in standard definition on Blue Underground's Blu- ray release of Fast Company, in high definition on Criterion release of Scanners and also in high definition on a bonus disc in Arrow Video's UK Blu- ray release of Videodrome, The bonus disc from Videodrome was later released on its own as David Cronenberg's Early Works.

His massive tome, De Synagoga Judaica (1st. ed. 1603), scrupulously documents the customs and society of German Jewry in the early modern period. Buxtorf was the father of Johannes Buxtorf the Younger. Life Buxtorf was born at Kamen in Westphalia. The original form of the name was Bockstrop, or Boxtrop, from which was derived the family crest, which bore the figure of a goat (Ger. Bock, he-goat). After the death of his father, who was minister of Kamen, Buxtorf studied at Marburg and the newly founded Herborn Academy, at the latter of which Caspar Olevian (1536‚Äì1587) and Johannes Piscator (1546‚Äì1625) had been appointed professors of theology. At a later date Piscator received the assistance of Buxtorf in the preparation of his Latin translation of the Old Testament, published at Herborn in 1602-1603. From Herborn Buxtorf went to Heidelberg, and thence to Basel, attracted by the reputation of Johann Jakob Grynaeus and J. G. Hospinian (1515‚Äì1575). After a short residence at Basel, he studied successively under Heinrich Bullinger (1504‚Äì1575) at Z√ºrich and Theodore Beza at Geneva. On his return to Basel, Grynaeus, desirous that the services of so promising a scholar should be secured to the university, procured him a situation as tutor in the family of Leo Curio, son of Celio Secondo Curione, well known for his sufferings on account of the Reformed faith. At the insistence of Grynaeus, Buxtorf undertook the duties of the Hebrew chair in the university, and discharged them for two years with such ability that at the end of that time he was unanimously appointed to the vacant office. From this date (1591) to his death in 1629 he remained in Basel, and devoted himself with remarkable zeal to the study of Hebrew and rabbinic literature. He received into his house many learned Jews, that he might discuss his difficulties with them, and he was frequently consulted by Jews themselves on matters relating to their ceremonial law. He seems to have well deserved the title which was conferred upon him of \\"Master of the Rabbins.\\" His partiality for Jewish society brought him, indeed, on one occasion into trouble with the authorities of the city, the laws against the Jews being very strict. Nevertheless, on the whole, his relations with the city of Basel were friendly. He remained firmly attached to the university which first recognized his merits, and declined two invitations from the University of Leiden and Academy of Saumur successively.

He played either as an attacking midfielder or as a striker. He has previously played for Aberdeen, Inverness CT, Hearts, St Mirren, Queen of the South, Dumbarton, Peterhead, Elgin City and Huntly. Notably, Wyness scored over 100 goals for Inverness during two spells with the club. Career Wyness began his career at Aberdeen, where he originally played as a midfielder. He was used sparingly as a squad player by several managers, until Ebbe Skovdahl allowed him to go on loan to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 1999, where he played as a midfielder, then as a striker. Wyness signed a permanent contract for Caley Thistle in January 2000. However, during his first twelve months at the club he struggled to make an impact, and was eventually transfer-listed by then- manager Steve Paterson. This provided Wyness with a huge incentive to fight his way back into the team and he responded to his transfer listing by beginning to score goals almost immediately. He was eventually taken off the transfer list in December 2000, and soon became a firm favourite of the Caley Thistle supporters. =Caley Thistle= Wyness was Caley Thistle's top scorer of season 2000‚Äì01, with 24 league goals. The following season, he netted 18 times in the league and, in season 2001‚Äì02, established a strike partnership with Paul Ritchie which resulted in 37 league goals between the two of them that season. In March 2003 he also scored the only goal of the game as Caley Thistle once again sent Celtic crashing out of the Scottish Cup. =Heart of Midlothian= Wyness's excellent performances in front of goal earned him a move to Heart of Midlothian in the summer of 2003. Wyness found it hard to break into the Hearts team and was only occasionally used by Levein. He fared better under Craig Levein's successor, John Robertson, who had also managed him at Caley Thistle, but when Robertson was replaced by George Burley in 2005 Wyness once again found himself out of favour. He returned on loan to Caley Thistle and he signed a pre-contract agreement in January 2006 to rejoin the Inverness club on a permanent basis. In late May 2006, once his Hearts contract expired, he signed a two-year deal with Caley Thistle. =Record= Wyness holds the Inverness Caledonian Thistle scoring record, with a total of 101 goals. He netted his 100th goal for Inverness against his first club, Aberdeen. =St. Mirren= In May 2008, Wyness agreed a two-year deal to join St Mirren.Gannon, Michael. New boy Wyness keen to be part of Buddies' vision of future, says Caldwell, Press and Journal, 20 May 2008. Wyness scored the first goal for the Buddies at their new ground named St. Mirren Park, in a match against Kilmarnock. =Queen of the South= On 25 September 2009 Dumfries club Queen of the South announced Wyness had joined on a three-month loan deal. Wyness netted a debut goal a day later in the 4‚Äì1 win away to Dunfermline Athletic that put Queens top of the table. Wyness returned to St. Mirren after making seven appearances and scoring two goals for Queens. =Recent career= On 25 January 2010, St. Mirren announced Wyness was free to find himself another club, and he was later released from his contract. Wyness then signed for Second Division club Dumbarton until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Wyness then signed for Peterhead for the 2010‚Äì11 season. Wyness signed for Elgin City during the 2012 summer transfer window. He scored his first goal for the club in an incredible 7‚Äì5 home loss in the first round of the 2012‚Äì13 Ramsden's Cup against Arbroath. After Elgin, he went on to play for Buckie Thistle in the 2015/16 season, and then signed for Huntly F.C. in 2016.

It takes place in New York City in the 1990s, and revisits some characters of the original, including Yossarian, Milo Minderbinder and Chaplain Tappman. The book has two stories that are interwoven throughout ‚Äì that of Yossarian in the last stages of his life, and that of Sammy Singer and Lew Rabinowitz, two men from Coney Island who also fought in World War II (the Sammy Singer character makes a brief appearance in Catch-22 as the tailgunner aboard Yossarian's bomber who kept waking up and fainting when he saw Yossarian trying to attend to the wounds of Snowden). As with Catch-22, the topic of death is omnipresent, only in this case from (usually) age-related illnesses, in particular cancer (rather than dying in battle, as with its predecessor). One notable inconsistency in the book is that although Yossarian was 28 in Catch-22, which took place in 1944, in Closing Time Yossarian is 68, and the time of Catch-22 is referred to as \\"50 years ago\\". When asked about the inconsistency in an interview with The New York Times, Heller replied, \\"I know, but I decided to ignore it.\\" There is a man mentioned by Lew named \\"Vonnegut\\", whom he met while in Dresden. This is a reference to Kurt Vonnegut's experiences in the Bombing of Dresden and his book Slaughterhouse-Five.

Biography=Author= His translation of the Song of Songs (published under the pseudonym of A. Bernstein, 1834) and his publication of Young Germany () established his reputation as a writer among the literary critics of Berlin. He was the author of two Ghetto stories, V√∂gele der Maggid and Mendel Gibbor, being one of the originators of this genre of modern fiction. =Reformer= He was also a publicist. In 1849 he founded the Urw√§hlerzeitung, in which (in 1851) he published some ultra-democratic articles which brought about his imprisonment. The paper was finally suppressed in 1853, and Bernstein established the Volkszeitung, a journal devoted, like its predecessor, largely to the dissemination of democratic views. His History of Revolution and Reaction in Prussia and Germany from the Revolution of 1848 up to the present (; 3 vols., 1883‚Äì1884) was a collection of important political essays. In the middle of the 19th century Bernstein took an active share in the movement for synagogue reform in Germany. =Scientist= His multivolume book From the field of natural science (; 1853-1856), later republished under the title Popular Books on Natural Sciencehttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/37224/37224-h/37224-h.htm (; 1880), was frequently reprinted and translated into nearly all the languages of Europe. Already in the edition of 1855, Bernstein published ideas on space, time and the speed of light which had appeared in the anonymous treatise The Stars and the Earth () written by 'an unknown clear-sighted thinker.'\\"ein unbekannter scharfsichtiger Denker\\" in: Karl Clausberg, \\"Zwischen den Sternen - Lichtbildarchive : was Einstein und Uexk√ºll, Benjamin und das Kino der Astronomie des 19.

Gedanken √ºber Raum, Zeit und Ewigkeit\\" (Berlin: Rogoff, 1923) A story in volume 16 of Bernstein's Naturwissenschaftliche Volksb√ºcher about riding along with the electricity travelling through a telegraph wire is often credited with inspiring the 16-year-old Albert Einstein to think about travelling along with a beam of light and seeing it stationary. Such thought experiments eventually led to his famous theory of special relativity.Frederick Gregory, \\"The Mysteries and Wonders of Natural Science: Aaron Bernstein's Naturwissenschaftliche Volksb√ºcher and the Adolescent Einstein,\\" in Einstein: The Formative Years, 1879-1909, ed.

Early life C. C. Little was born in Brookline, Massachusetts and attended Harvard University after his secondary education at the Noble and Greenough School. While studying under W. E. Castle, Little began his work with mice, focusing on inheritance, transplants, and grafts. He also was an assistant dean and secretary to the president. His most important research occurred at Harvard, including what some call his most brilliant work, \\"A Mendelian explanation for the inheritance of a trait that has apparently non-Mendelian characteristics\\". His observations on transplant rejection became codified into the \\"five laws of transplant immunology\\" by George Snell. Little developed the \\"DBA (Dilute, Brown and non-Agouti)\\" strain of mice while at Harvard. For his research, he received posthumously the 1978 Cancer Research Institute William B. Coley Award. Little received an A.B. from Harvard University in 1910, an M.S. in 1912, and D.Sc. in 1914 in zoology, with special focus in the new science of genetics. During World War I Little served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, attaining the rank of Major. Following the war he spent three years at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In 1921 he helped found the American Birth Control League with Margaret Sanger and Lothrop Stoddard. Career Little accepted the post of President of the University of Maine in 1922, becoming at age 33 the youngest university president in the country. While there he started a summer laboratory in Bar Harbor. In 1925 he left to become the President of the University of Michigan. His tenure at the university was controversial due to his outspokenness in favor of eugenics, birth control, and euthanasia. He left Michigan in 1929 in order to devote himself to his research at Bar Harbor. With funding from Detroit car manufacturers he was able to improve the facility for year-round use. He renamed it the \\"Jackson Laboratory\\" in honor of one donor, Roscoe B. Jackson of the Hudson Motor Car Corporation. Also in 1929 he took on a part-time job as managing director of the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later became the American Cancer Society (ACS)) and served as President to the American Eugenics Society. Funding for the Jackson Laboratory was extremely limited during the Great Depression, but it received one of the first grants from the newly formed National Cancer Institute in 1938. Little energetically developed both the lab and the ACS, and by 1944 they were shipping 9000 mice a week to other laboratories. The laboratory and all of the livestock were destroyed in the Great Bar Harbor Fire in the Fall of 1947. The lab was quickly rebuilt and most mouse strains were recovered from other labs around the world. By 1950 the lab was maintaining 60 inbred strains, and had developed the F1 hybrid that became widely used for chemical testing. Little resigned in 1954. His last major post, from 1954 to 1969, was as the Scientific Director of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (renamed Council for Tobacco Research in 1964). In that role he was a leading scientific voice of the tobacco industry and oversaw a USD 1 million research budget that gave grants to hundreds of scientists. In 1959 he refuted his earlier assertion, made as Director of the ACS, that inhaling fine particles is unhealthy, and stated that smoking does not cause lung cancer and is at most a minor contributing factor. A decade later he said, \\"there is no demonstrated causal relationship between smoking or any disease.\\" In keeping with his earlier research he believed that the main cause of cancer was genetic, not environmental. Death and legacy Little died of a heart attack in 1971 in Ellsworth, Maine at the age of 83. The C. C. Little Science Building at the University of Michigan was named in his honor. In 2017, five faculty members and an undergraduate student submitted a formal request to University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel to change the building's name because of Little's previous support of eugenics. The building‚Äôs sign without Little‚Äôs name was replaced on March 29, 2018. See also * Eugenics in the United States References *C. C. Little, Cancer and Inbred Mice by James F.

History=Southern Pacific= The Central Pacific Railroad opened its Berkeley Branch Railroad to the intersection of Shattuck and University Avenues on August 16, 1876. Early civic leader Francis K. Shattuck donated land for the railroad and its depot, and subsidized the initial construction. Berkeley was the terminus of the line until 1878, when it was extended northwest along Shattuck. The Central Pacific was leased by the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) in 1885, then transferred to its Northern Railway subsidiary in 1888. The first Berkeley station was a small wooden building at the northwest corner of Center Street and Shattuck; it was replaced in the 1890s by a slightly larger by still modest station. On October 26, 1903, the Key System began electric commuter rail operation from Berkeley to the San Francisco ferries - a direct threat to the SP's steam-hauled trains - on a line that paralleled the SP tracks on Shattuck. Around that time, Cal president Benjamin Ide Wheeler and other prominent Berkeley academics lobbied SP president E. H. Harriman for an improved train station to complement John Galen Howard's emerging architectural style for the nearby University of California, Berkeley. Finally, the devastating 1906 earthquake and subsequent rebuilding \\"served as a powerful incentive to expedite the project\\". Surveying work began in June 1906; that September, SP management announced their intentions to convert their suburban lines to a frequent electric service to compete with the Key System. The new station, an elegant red brick structure with buff terracotta trim, red tile roof, and a colonnade, opened on April 9, 1908. It was officially designed by SP architect Daniel J. Patterson in a similar style to √âmile B√©nard's original plans for the university, though the high quality of its design and circumstantial evidence led some historians to believe it was actually designed by Howard. The SP lines were fully electrified in 1911. =BART= Entrance to the Berkeley BART station (bottom right) as seen shortly after the station opened in 1973 Downtown Berkeley opened on January 29, 1973, as part of the extension from MacArthur to Richmond, with service southward to Fremont until the opening of the Transbay Tube and subsequent service to San Francisco later that year. The station was designed by Maher & Martens of San Francisco in collaboration with Parsons Brinckerhoff, Tudor Construction, and Bechtel. In 1995, BART changed the name of the station from \\"Berkeley\\" to \\"Downtown Berkeley\\" in an effort to minimize confusion between this station and North Berkeley. Removal of rotunda New main entrance to the station. A station and plaza renovation project began construction on August 29, 2016 and opened to the public on October 19, 2018. The new plaza includes new lighting, landscaping, drainage, paving, and bus shelters in the overground plaza of the station. The old main rotunda entrance has been removed and was replaced by a glass entrance structure similar to those in Downtown Oakland. The $11.2 million project is funded primarily by BART, with additional funding from the City of Berkeley, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Alameda County. A further project to renovate the underground station interior is in the planning stages. Station layout Like most underground BART stations, Downtown Berkeley has two levels: a mezzanine containing the faregates and an island platform with two tracks. Access to the station is provided by five street-level entrances on Shattuck Avenue, with two at Addison Street and Allston Way each and one at the southwest corner of Shattuck Avenue and Center Street. The escalators at the latter were topped by an 24-sided rotunda featuring artwork of the UCB Botanical Garden.

He was further known as an anti-contagionist, a school of thought, named later on, that did not believe in the then novel concept that bacteria were the main cause of disease. In particular he argued in favor of a variety of conditions collectively contributing to the incidence of disease including: personal state of health, the fermentation of environmental ground water, and also the germ in question. He was most well known for his establishment of hygiene as an experimental science and also was a strong proponent for the founding of hygiene institutes in Germany. His work served as an example which other institutes around the world emulated. Early life and education Pettenkofer was born in Lichtenheim, near Neuburg an der Donau, now part of Weichering. He was a nephew of Franz Xaver (1783‚Äì1850), who from 1823 was a surgeon and apothecary to the Bavarian court and was the author of some chemical investigations on the vegetable alkaloids. After a falling out with a relative he was staying with he briefly entered the theater. He returned to his family to marry Helene Pettenkofer. A stipulation of his marriage was that he pursue another career and was advised to pursue medicine. He attended the Wilhelmsgymnasium, in Munich, then studied pharmacy and medicine at the Ludwig Maximilian University, where he graduated M.D. in 1845. Career as chemist left After working under Liebig at Gie√üen, Pettenkofer was appointed chemist to the Munich mint in 1845. Two years later he was chosen as an extraordinary professor of chemistry at the medical faculty. In 1853 he was made a full professor and in 1865 he also became a professor of hygiene. In his earlier years he devoted himself to chemistry, both theoretical and applied, publishing papers on a wide range of topics. One of his first projects and subsequent publications was in the separation of gold, silver, and platinum. This work derived from his position at the Munich mint and was centered around minimizing the costs of currency conversion by separating the precious metals from one another. The purer elements could then be utilized in other applications. Later in his career he continued published and spoke about the numerical relations between the atomic masses of analogous elements. His theories were early in the development of the Periodic Table. He rejected the current theory of triads and expanded the connections between the elements to larger groupings. He argued that the weights of different elements in a group were separated by multiples of a certain number that varied based upon the group. His work in this area was later cited by Dmitri Mendeleev in his construction of the Periodic Table of Elements. He continued his publications in a wide variety of other fields as well including: the formation of aventurine glass, the manufacture of illuminating gas from wood, the preservation of oil paintings, and an improved process for cement production among other things. The color-forming reaction known by his name for the detection of bile acids was published in 1844. In his widely used method for the quantitative determination of carbonic acid the gaseous mixture is shaken up with baryta or limewater of known strength and the change in alkalinity ascertained by means of oxalic acid. He further provided the experimental proof that the mysterious haematinum of ancient times was in fact a copper- colored glass., M. Ueber einen antiken rothen Glasfluss (Haematinon) und √ºber Aventurin-Glas. Abhandlungen der naturw.-techn. Commission der k. b. Akad. der Wissensch. I. Bd. M√ºnchen, literar.-artist. Anstalt, 1856. Career as hygienist Pettenkofer's name is most familiar in connection with his work in practical hygiene, as an apostle of good water, fresh air and proper sewage disposal. His attention was drawn to this subject by the unhealthy condition in Munich in the 19th century. Specifically he examined the field of hygiene and determined that there was a minimal amount of rigorous research. He was responsible for transitioning the field of hygiene into a research-oriented field. He is further responsible for the acceptance of hygiene as a science to be examined in medical schools and to be taught in specific hygiene departments. In 1865 his petitions to the government were accepted and three departments of hygiene were established in Munich, W√ºrzburg, and Erlangen. By 1882 hygiene was included in examinations for medical students in every major city of Germany. As one of the principal proponents for the field of hygiene in Munich he was responsible for giving presentations to government officials in order to secure funding for public health projects. One of the prevailing arguments of the day that Pettenkofer focused on was the relationship between sewage and the health of a population. In one of his first major projects in his home city of Munich Pettenkofer advocated for the development of running water throughout the city. He also emphasized the selection of the Mangfall River, not the readily at hand and highly polluted Isar River, as the source of the city's drinking water. Many of his additions and plans for the city's sewage system are reflected today in the current sewage system layout. During his schooling he studied for a time under Justus von Liebig where he applied his study of chemistry to the study of chemical reactions occurring within the body. This in particular focused on the study of the science of nutrition and the reactions in the body that consumed foods and produced the processes of the body. He further advocated for reform of the food production system used in Munich. He argued that the system for the study of proper cattle feed was more well developed than that for humans and recommended civic funding for studying proper nutrition. He proposed that this study of nutrition was important specifically for the poor and those in strictly controlled environments such as prison because they were most at risk for obtaining sub- par nutrition due to their limited control over their food consumption. He further advocated for the construction of more spacious living accommodations. He asserted that there was a strong link between proper circulation of \\"good air\\" through houses, adequate space for living, and the health of the occupants. His beliefs aligned significantly with the school of thought known as the Miasma theory. He firmly believed that the causes of disease were related to the multitude of environmental factors that the people of Munich were required to live in. Air was of a particular interest to him and he continued to advocate for its relevance to the processes of disease, specifically the spread of cholera. He was also a strong proponent of regular bathing and changing of clothes in its relationship to health through the further regulation of the heat of the body. He advocated that health was the collective responsibility of a city to behave as best they are able to further the health of the general population. In addition to the wide number of publications and lectures that he gave on the subject of public health Pettenkofer was also involved in the initiative to create an Institute of Public Health in Munich. He continued research into a variety of fields listed above as head of the Institute of Physiology in Munich from 1857 onwards. After numerous successful audiences with two of the kings of Bavaria he had helped found the first three hygiene departments. In 1879 he finally achieved his goal of the creation of a standalone Institute of Hygiene in Munich. This institution was larger than his previous accommodations in the department of Physiology and allowed him to continue to his research and to gather a large cohort of research students under his teachings. The founding of his Institute of Hygiene drew significant international attention and was considered a model for many later institutions including the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. During his career his position as a strong proponent of public health at times placed him at odds with his contemporaries, most notably Robert Koch. During his career Koch identified and isolated a large number of bacterial strains and was a supporter of the theory that these germs were the main causes of disease. This placed him at odds with Pettenkofer's broader approach to disease that involved many other environmental factors in addition to the activity of the germ of a disease. The two scientists conflicted most notably over the subject of cholera. In one specific case, Pettenkofer obtained bouillon laced with a large dose of Vibrio cholerae bacteria from Robert Koch, the proponent of the theory that the bacteria was the sole cause of the disease. He consumed the bouillon in a self-test in the presence of several witnesses on 7 October 1892. He also took bicarbonate of soda to neutralise his stomach acid to counter a suggestion by Koch that the acid could kill the bacteria. Pettenkofer suffered mild symptoms for nearly a week but claimed these were not associated with cholera. The modern view is that he did indeed have cholera, but was lucky to just have a mild case and he possibly had some immunity from a previous episode.Lawrence K. Altman, Who Goes First?: The Story of Self-experimentation in Medicine, pp. 24-25, University of California Press, 1987 . Publications Pettenkofer published his views on hygiene and disease in numerous books and papers; he was an editor of the Zeitschrift f√ºr Biologie (together with Carl von Voit) from 1865 to 1882, and of the Archiv f√ºr Hygiene from 1883 to 1894. In addition to his research publications he also gave a significant number of lectures to government officials in order to persuade them to provide funding for civic works and governmental oversight committees to promote and assess the state public health. The 1899 handwritten manuscript 'On the self purification of rivers' and Pettenkofer's papers can be found at the archives of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Death Pettenkofer's name of the LSHTM Frieze in Keppel Street In 1894 he retired from active work, and on 10 February 1901 he shot himself in a fit of depression. He died at his home in the Residenz in Munich. He is buried in the Alter S√ºdfriedhof in Munich.  Recognition  During his lifetime he received numerous accolades. He was presented with the title of \\"Honorary Citizen\\" of Munich and given a gold medal. His work in hygiene precipitated the creation of the \\"Pettenkofer Foundation for Research in Hygiene\\" which received funding from the cities of Munich and Leipzig to fund research projects related to Hygiene and Public Health. In 1883 he was awarded a hereditary title of nobility and was given the title \\"Excellency.\\" In 1897 he was awarded the Harlen Medal from the British Institute of Public Health. Max Joseph von Pettenkofer's name features on the Frieze of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Twenty- three pioneers of public health and tropical medicine were chosen to feature on the School's building when it was constructed in 1929.

Biography Pettenkofen was born in Vienna; his father was a merchant and landowner. He grew up on his father's estate in Galitzia. After his father's death, he grew up with the family of his cousin Ferdinand von Saar in Vienna. In 1834, giving up a military career, he became a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied with Leopold Kupelwieser and Franz Eybl. At this time, he painted genre works in typical Biedermeier style. During the Revolutions of 1848, he became a military painter in the style of Carl Schindler. While performing his duties, he spent some time in Szolnok, Hungary; an area which left a great impression on him and led to his style becoming more picturesque. In 1852, he went to Paris and came under the influence of the Barbizon school. His paintings are recognized for the sincerity with which the artist depicts the uneventful melancholy life of Hungarian peasants and gypsies, without any theatrical pathos or forced humour. He was admitted as a member of the Vienna Academy in 1866 and, in 1872, became an honorary member of the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. In 1876, he was knighted. Between 1870 and 1880, he took annual trips to Venice. He died at the \\"Sanatorium Loew\\" in Vienna in 1889. That same year, a street in Landstra√üe was named after him. In 1893, he was buried in a grave of honor (), designed by Viktor Tilgner, at the Zentralfriedhof.

It grew organically out of a promotional album M≈ìbius made for the French car manufacturer Citro√´n, called \\"The Star\\", in 1983. Background and publication history In the initial story, M≈ìbius introduces two genderless protagonists, Stel and Atan, who crash on a barren planet and must traverse it in an old Citro√´n. They eventually stumble on a camp of interstellar refugees surrounding a mysterious pyramid, and are transported to an unknown world described as a 'Garden of Eden somewhere in another galaxy'. The open ending of the Citro√´n story inspired M≈ìbius to wonder what would happen next. He plotted out three or four books' worth of stories that were also conceived as the basis of a coherent M≈ìbius universe, one which crossed over with other major works like The Airtight Garage. In effect, a recurrent character in the series was \\"Master [Ma√Ætre in French] Burg\\", Stel's dream guide who aided him in his quest on Edena, which was a palindrome of \\"[Major] Grubert\\", the main protagonist of The Airtight Garage, and by M≈ìbius intended to be one and the same person. M≈ìbius was strongly influenced by the teachings of Jean-Paul Appel-Gu√©ry, whose commune on Tahiti he had joined with his family in the period 1983-1984, and Swiss nutritionist Guy-Claude Burger, as well as his own transient lifestyle (\\"The Gardens of Edena\\" was drawn in Tokyo and Los Angeles for example, and \\"The Goddess\\" was begun in France and completed in California, whereas \\"Stel\\" was begun in California and completed in France). Questions are posed about dreams, nutrition and health, biology and sexuality, the human desire to live in a structured society, and archetypal good and evil. All of these philosophical elements are organically embedded in deceptively 'light' stories. The two protagonists Stel and Atan for example, stemming from a highly industrialized civilization, (re)discover their human sexuality on Edena, brought on by the circumstance that they, cut off from that civilization, are forced to consume natural nutrition, with Atan in the process becoming \\"Atan _a_ \\". M≈ìbius started out the series by restricting himself to a 'Clear Line' style (Ligne Claire), with minimal details, though in later outings, especially the short stories \\"The Still Planet\\" and \\"The Repairmen\\", his signature intricate M≈ìbius graphic style started to resurface, before returning to his original art style for the last outing in the main narrative, Sra. While M≈ìbius has received a multitude of (international) awards for his body of work, this series did receive a specific one, the 1991 Spanish Haxtur Award of the Sal√≥n Internacional del C√≥mic del Principado de Asturias, for La Diosa (The Goddess) in the category \\"Best Drawings\\". Concurrently, the short story \\"The Still Planet\\", which, coming in at 25 pages, accounted for half the contents of the comic book Concrete Celebrates Earth Day 1990 (52 pages, Dark Horse Comics, April 1990) in which it was first published, was instrumental in winning the 1991 Eisner Award for \\"Best Single Issue\\". Noteworthy was, that the story is created as a wordless comic, save for the title, with only the (highly detailed) art intended to tell the story. In this, Moebius repeated the experimental style utilized for the comic that had brought him international renown in the mid-1970s, Arzach. Additionally, the story was under its French title \\"La plan√®te encore\\" adapted into a French-produced animation short in 2010. M≈ìbius Production served as a production company, with wife Isabelle Giraud serving as one of its producers. M≈ìbius himself was one of the two directors of the short.\\"La plan√®te encore\\", IMDb.com Episodes The series consists of five parts, each published as a separate volume, plus a sixth volume containing shorter stories \\"Seeing Naples\\", \\"Another Planet\\" (=\\"The Still Planet\\"), \\"The Repairmen\\" and \\"Dying to See Naples\\", that are outside of the main narrative: * Sur l'√âtoile (The Star); Paris: Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, December 1983, * Les Jardins d'Edena (The Gardens of Edena); Tournai: Casterman, September 1988, * La D√©esse (The Goddess); Tournai: Casterman, September 1990, * Stel; Tournai: Casterman, April 1994, * Sra; Tournai: Casterman, September 2001, * Les R√©parateurs (The Repairers); Tournai: Casterman, September 2001, English editions In the English language, the series, translated by Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier, has seen publications between 1988 and 1994 by Marvel Comics (under its Epic imprint), Titan Books, Graphitti Designs, and, at a later point in time, by Dark Horse as well, the latter completing the main narrative in translation in 2016, with the short stories following suit in 2018.
