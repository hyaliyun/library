A native of Jersey City, New Jersey, Geraghty was a graduate of Villanova University, where he received a degree in journalism. He went right from the Villanova campus to the Brooklyn Dodgers, but would appear in only 70 Major League games, 51 with the Dodgers in his rookie season and 19 more with the Boston Braves (1943‚Äì44). He compiled a batting average of .199 in 146 at bats, with his 29 hits including four doubles. He also played ten seasons in the minor leagues. Geraghty threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Survived 1946 Spokane bus tragedy On June 24, , Geraghty survived one of the greatest tragedies in baseball history, when the bus carrying his minor league team, the Spokane Indians of the Class B Western International League, crashed while attempting to avert an oncoming car on a rain-slicked mountain pass. Nine players were killed; Geraghty was among the injured. He sustained a severe head wound when he was thrown through a window before the bus burst into flames, but was able to climb up the hillside and signal for help. The Spokane club was decimated and could only continue the season with players loaned from other teams and organizations. \\"I guess I'm pretty lucky\\", Geraghty told the Associated Press the day after the crash. \\"I was thrown right out a window. I took the window frame right with me. I remember flying out the window, but I must have been knocked out because I don't remember landing.\\"WIL Baseball web site Despite his head injury, Geraghty was named the immediate replacement for Mel Cole‚Äîthe team's catcher and player-manager who perished in the crash‚Äîas the Indians' first post-accident skipper. But his injuries were too serious and former big- leaguer Glenn Wright assumed the reins for the rest of 1946.Costello, Rory, Ben Geraghty. SABR Biography Project Geraghty was able to return to Spokane to manage the Indians in 1947, and he led them to a second-place finish and 87 victories. His health, however, would never be the same. He would manage in the minors for the next 16 seasons, but he was troubled by heart disease, cardiovascular disease and ulcers,Spink, J.G.

Westport, Connecticut: The Greenwood Press, 2005, page 33 Manager of young Henry Aaron In his 17-year managing career, Geraghty won 1,317 games and lost 1,021 (.563) and won five pennants in seven years (1953‚Äì59) while piloting Class A Sally League and Triple-A American Association farm clubs of the Braves, then based in Milwaukee. In the ten seasons of 1953 through 1962, a Geraghty-managed team never finished lower than second place. But his impact was felt beyond mere wins and losses. In 1953, Geraghty managed a racially integrated team in the Jim Crow South with the Jacksonville Braves, and one of his players was 19-year-old Henry Aaron. Aaron, wrote author and former minor league pitcher Pat Jordan in his 1975 memoir A False Spring, \\"believed that Ben Geraghty was the greatest manager who ever lived, certainly the greatest manager he ever played for ...\\" In addition to his on-field strategic acumen and his ability to develop playing talent, Geraghty, a white man, regularly confronted the rigid racial segregation of the times, insisting that he and his African-American players be served as equals at the finest restaurants. \\"Invariably, they would be refused service\\", Jordan wrote. \\"While Aaron waited nervously outside, Geraghty complained loudly to the management ... They [would go] to the next best restaurant, and the next and the next, until Geraghty finally located one that would serve [them].\\" Afflicted by health woes But Geraghty would never be called to manage or coach in the Major Leagues. He was strongly considered for the Braves' managerial opening when Fred Haney stepped down following the season, but Chuck Dressen was hired instead.Linthurst, Randy, Too Good in Minors to Manage in Majors, SABR Ulcers then sidelined Geraghty for much of the 1960 season, while he was in the midst of a three-year term as skipper of Milwaukee's Louisville Colonels Triple-A farm club. In 1962, he left the Braves and joined the Cleveland Indians' farm system as manager of their new Triple-A International League affiliate, the Jacksonville Suns. That January he also underwent a four-hour operation in a Jacksonville hospital to correct a circulatory condition.The New York Times, January 30, 1962 Recovering in time for spring training, he led his 1962 Suns to 94 victories and earned his second Minor League Manager of the Year Award and final pennant, although his Suns were defeated in seven games by the Atlanta Crackers in the finals of the Governors' Cup playoffs. The following June 18, in Jacksonville, in the middle of his second season in the Suns' job, Geraghty was stricken with a fatal heart attack, one month shy of his 51st birthday. \\"I don't know of another manager in baseball whom the paying fans held in so much respect\\", The Florida Times-Union's sports editor wrote upon Geraghty's death.Jacksonville.com retrospective He is interred in Evergreen Cemetery, Jacksonville.Baseball Almanac Before his 1946 injury from the Spokane bus accident, Geraghty also was a basketball coach, serving as an assistant with the varsity at Seton Hall University.

As with other ambulance services in the United Kingdom, it does not charge its patients directly for its services, but instead receives funding through general taxation. It responds to medical emergencies in Northern Ireland with the 300-plus ambulance vehicles at its disposal. Its fleet includes mini- buses, ambulance officers' cars, support vehicles, RRVs and accident and emergency ambulances. History The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service was formed on 1 April 1995 through the amalgamation of its four predecessors. Its full title is the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service Health and Social Care Trust. Ambulance in Ann Street, Belfast, October 2009 Services The Service employs approximately 1,300 staff of which approximately 420 are paramedics, 300 are emergency medical technicians (EMT) and 100 are control centre staff, which work shift patterns to ensure the service is operational 24/7. They are based across 46 stations & sub-stations, two control centres (emergency and non-emergency) and a regional ambulance training centre. It responds to approximately 201,000 emergency (999) calls per year (with the number of 999 calls is increasing per year) with a combination of traditional emergency ambulances with two crew members, and rapid response vehicles (RRV) crewed by a single paramedic. RRVs respond mostly to calls where there is a potential immediate life-threat (Category A) because they can respond more quickly than a conventional ambulance. Double-crew ambulances respond to both emergency and non-emergency (healthcare professional-initiated urgent) calls as well as providing critical-care transfers between hospitals. The Trust aims to provide at least one paramedic to every emergency call by staffing each double-crew, emergency ambulance with two paramedics, or a paramedic and an EMT, and utilising RRV. The trust has not adopted the controversial use of emergency care assistants (ECA) in the way some other UK ambulance services have. In 2019, the service entered a partnership with the Ulster University to deliver a foundation degree in Paramedic Science, with the first cohort of trainees graduating in December 2019. Further cohorts are scheduled until a BSc honours degree commences in line with future requirements for professional registration of UK paramedics. In addition to the emergency service, NIAS has a fleet of Patient Care Service vehicles which are used for more routine patient transport to/from hospital. Within the Patient Care Service there are both single-crewed 'sitting case' (minibus) vehicles as well as double-crewed 'intermediate care vehicles' (ICV) which carry a stretcher. In 2016, NIAS was commissioned to provide a helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) for the first time in Northern Ireland, which was by then the only region of the UK not to have one. Following a public consultation, they partnered with the charity Air Ambulance Northern Ireland who provide the aircraft and airbase, with the doctors and paramedics provided by NIAS. The service undertook its first live mission in August 2017.  Performance  NIAS currently has a target time of eight minutes to reach the scene of an emergency although, during December 2017 only 47.5% of this target was met therefore the average response time in Northern Ireland was 16 minutes 10 seconds. Currently the trust works with volunteer and private ambulance services to help cope and meet key response times, this is due to the current increased demand and squeeze on public spending across Northern Ireland. Staff have expressed concern by the growing pressures they face and overall low morale across the service. The ambulance service aims to restructure the service to cope with future increased demand. In September 2018, the ambulance service requested an additional ¬£30million in funding from the Department of Health to restructure the service and to recruit an additional 300 staff members, most of whom would be paramedics, EMTs and emergency call takers. The recruitment is meant to quicken response times and relieve pressure on staff.

It was the first professionally produced, authorised independent spin-off of the long-running TV series Doctor Who, and the only such production to be made while the originating TV series was still on the air (it ended in 1989). Produced and directed by Keith Barnfather and written by Andy Lane and Helen Stirling, Wartime followed the adventures of Warrant Officer John Benton of the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce a.k.a. UNIT. During a mission for UNIT leader Brigadier Alistair Lethbridge- Stewart, Benton visits his childhood home where ghosts of the past rise up to haunt him. John Levene, who played Benton on Doctor Who off-and-on between 1968 and 1975, reprised the role for the film. In 1997, a revised version of the film was released, acknowledging in the credits for the first time a voice-only cameo by Nicholas Courtney as the Brigadier which had always been present in the film. Although the British Broadcasting Corporation owns the rights to Doctor Who and its lead characters, Reeltime was able to obtain permission from Derrick Sherwin, creator of Benton and UNIT, to use both entities in this film so long as the Doctor was not mentioned. This set a precedent that led to further independently made spin-offs featuring former companions of the Doctor, and alien races from the show, which would be released over the following decade; ultimately an independent company, Big Finish Productions, would in the late 1990s receive a licence from the BBC to produce officially sanctioned Doctor Who-based productions. The fact Benton is a warrant officer, having been promoted in the first Fourth Doctor serial, Robot, places it after that serial, but presumably prior to his departure from UNIT in the late 1970s as revealed in the serial Mawdryn Undead. In September 2015, the film was released on DVD Plot On his way to UNIT HQ in order to deliver some radioactive materials, Warrant Officer John Benton has an unexpected flashback to his childhood in Lancashire. After visiting the grave of his older brother Chris, Benton has a further flashback to his childhood in 1944. Later, having failed to contact UNIT successfully, Benton senses that there is potential trouble lurking nearby and orders Willis to repair the jeep while he himself investigates. Unbeknownst to both of them, there is a stranger lurking in the woods who aims to steal the radioactive material. As Benton wanders through the woods, he is further haunted by his childhood; it is revealed that Benton blames himself for the death of his older brother Christopher‚Äîwhile playing a game of chase, Christopher slipped off a wall and fell to his death. A ghostly entity, which takes the form of Benton's father, torments John and tries to convince him that he is weak and unworthy of being in the army. John eventually breaks the hold over the spirit and realizes that his brother's death was an accident and that he was actually trying to save him. Returning to the jeep, having now exorcised his demons, he manages to subdue the mystery man who was attempting to steal the radioactive source. Benton and Willis leave the woods and resume their journey while the voice of his father states that the game is now over.  Background  In 1987 Wartime was first published on VHS. In 1997 Keith Barnfather revised the film. He added a voice over with Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and released this version as well on VHS. The VHS also contained old video recordings of a Doctor Who Convention in London with Patrick Troughton, Colin Baker, Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee, and Peter Davison.Thomson, Gale (2007): Video Sourcebook: A Guide to Programs Currently Available on Video. Gale / Cengage Learning: S. 2006 In 2015 a DVD of the film was published. In this film it is the first time Sergeant Benton's first name John is mentioned. Since then the name was used for Sergeant Benton in the media, by fans and in other Doctor Who releases. For example, the name John appears in the Big Finish audio play Council of War. Furthermore, it was used in a few novels which were produced by the BBC, forexample in David A. McIntee's The Face of the Enemy, Paul Leonard's Genocide, Paul Cornell's No Future, Gary Russell's The Scales of Injustice, Keith Topping's The King of Terror, Tommy Donbavand's Shroud of Sorrow, Christopher Bulis' The Eye of the Giant, Mark Morris' Deep Blue or Simon Guerrier's Time Signature.

The tram carried passengers up and down the hillside until its closure in 1981, and its abandoned lower station can still be found near Jetstream‚Äôs station and Ninja's final brake run. Ninja is the only Arrow Dynamics suspended coaster west of the Mississippi River. The other three suspended coasters in North America (Vortex at Canada's Wonderland, Iron Dragon at Cedar Point, and The Bat at Kings Island) are all east of the Mississippi. The station building is designed to resemble elements of Japanese architecture, and features several large renditions of classic Japanese woodblock prints of popular Kabuki actors of the Edo period, mostly by T≈çsh≈´sai Sharaku. Soon after Six Flags Astroworld was shut down in 2005, the trains from their suspended XLR-8 were brought to Six Flags Magic Mountain to be used on Ninja. Ninja received a fresh coat of paint for the 2007 season; the ride was repainted with bright red track and white supports. In 2008, Six Flags Magic Mountain installed a new control system for Ninja. =Incidents= *On August 30, 2008, at approximately 4 p.m. PDT, 20-year-old Michael Rohrer of West Hollywood, California was struck by a coaster vehicle passing overhead after he entered a restricted area below the ride by scaling two 6-foot perimeter fences to retrieve a lost hat. He was treated at the scene by park first aid, then airlifted to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles in comatose condition. He was pronounced dead on August 31, 2008 at approximately 2 a.m. PDT. Cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma. *On the evening of July 7, 2014, a pine tree branch fell across the coaster's track, causing the first car of the train to derail, stranding the riders aboard. Four people were injured in the accident and two were treated in the hospital, all for minor injuries. Twelve days after the incident, Six Flags Magic Mountain reopened the coaster on July 19, 2014.

Alden and Cynthia M. Westover, was an American journalist, author, inventor, and New York City municipal employee. Early life and education She was born in Afton, Iowa, the daughter of Oliver S. Westover and Lucilda (Lewis) Westover. She was the grand-daughter of Alexander Campbell, a leader of the Campbellite religious reform movement. Her mother died when she was very young, and during her childhood she often accompanied her father, a geologist and miner, on prospecting expeditions throughout the American west. The second of her three books, Bushy (1896), was based on these childhood experiences. She graduated from Colorado State University with a teaching degree and also studied at the Denver Business College. Municipal employment Alden moved to New York City in 1882 to further her musical education in hopes of becoming an opera singer; she later sang as a soloist in church choirs. In 1887 she was appointed a New York inspector of customs, in which position she was involved in the seizure of smuggled goods. She learned French, German, Italian, and Spanish in order to communicate better with people she came in contact with through her job. Beginning in 1890, Alden worked for two years as secretary to the New York City Commissioner of Street Cleaning. During this period, she invented a street-cleaners' cart, to make life easier for the street sweepers and for their horses, which at that time had to pull heavy wagons. The cart was small enough for the sweepers to handle themselves, and it had a self-dumping feature so that it could be emptied directly onto the trash barges, bypassing the horse-drawn wagons. For this invention, the Parisian Academy of Inventors awarded Alden a gold medal and made her an honorary member. For a time she was also employed at the New York Museum of Natural History but left this job to take up journalism. Journalism and Sunshine Society Alden entered journalism in 1894 as editor of the woman's department at the New York Recorder. In 1897 she moved to the New York Tribune, where she held the same position. During her three years with the Tribune, she planned and founded the International Sunshine Society, serving as its president-general for the rest of her life. It started with Alden's practice of sending Christmas cards and gifts to shut-ins, and she slowly expanded it, first to her circle of fellow writers, and later to a membership that peaked at half a million. The focus also shifted to establishing institutions to serve the blind, funded mainly by donations from members as there were no membership dues. The Sunshine Society set up a sanatorium in Bensonhurst for blind children in 1902 (which became Harbor Hospital fifteen years later), a nursery and kindergarten for blind children in Brooklyn (1905), and the Sunshine Arthur Home for blind babies in Summit, New Jersey (1910). It later opened homes for the elderly and operated schools for orphans, lunchrooms for working women, libraries, and summer camps. The society also championed legislation in aid of the blind in a total of 18 states. In 1899, Alden accepted a position on the editorial staff of the Ladies' Home Journal, continuing there until 1909. Although the journal was based in the Midwest, she continued to reside in New York City, where she died.

Walker) * The First Book of Song and Story (1903, introduction only) * The Ways of Earning Money: A Book for Women (1904) * The Baby Blind (1915) Personal life In 1896 she married John Alden, who would later become the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle. Their house was only 8 feet wide and became known as \\"the littlest house in Brooklyn\\". Following her death and cremation, John placed her ashes at the foot of a tree planted in her honor in New York's Central Park.

It was ported to the Amiga, Apple IIgs, Atari 7800, Atari ST, and Macintosh. Description Mean 18 is notable for two reasons: it was the first computer golf game to give the golfer's point of view of the course, and it was the first golf game to come with a course editor that allowed players to create their own courses. Mean 18 featured the Augusta National and Pebble Beach and St. Andrews courses. It used the soon popular 3-click control system, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade. The game features Beginner and Expert difficulty options. The Expert mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click more crucial. The player can also choose between regular and professional tees. For the regular mode, the tees are shorter and the computer automatically recommends the best club. Using the professional tees, the computer still recommends clubs, but not necessarily the best ones for the shot. Reception Computer Gaming World cited the practice green, the computer caddy, and course editor as reasons for preferring the Amiga version of Mean 18 to the also-\\"outstanding\\" Leader Board. Info gave the Amiga version four stars out of five, stating \\"If you're a golfer, you'll like Mean 18\\" but criticizing the \\"blocky IBM-style graphics. Complete Amigatization would solve a lot of the problems\\". Compute! listed it in May 1988 as one of \\"Our Favorite Games\\", praising the graphics, sound, realism, and course editor.

Early life and career Aitken was born in Redondo Beach, California in 1968. In 1987, he initially studied magazine illustrationDorothy Spears (July 21, 2011), Can You Hear Me Now? New York Times. with Philip Hays at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena before graduating in Fine Arts in 1991. He moved to New York in 1994 where he had his first solo show at 303 Gallery. He currently lives and works in Venice, California, and New York.Media Art Net  Aitken, Doug: Biography Work Aitken's body of work ranges from photography, print media, sculpture, and architectural interventions, to narrative films, sound, single and multi- channel video works, installations, and live performance.UC Berkeley Art, Technology, and Culture Colloquium - Bio: Doug AitkenSleepwalkers exhibition catalogue, published by the Museum of Modern Art, 2007, Aitken's video works have taken place in such culturally loaded sites as Jonestown in Guyana, southwest Africa's diamond mines, and India's Bollywood.Doug Aitken, September 10 ‚Äì October 8, 2005 Regen Projects, Los Angeles. =Site-specific projects= Aitken has created an array of site-specific installations, sometimes synthesizing interactive media with architecture. A recent site-specific work, New Horizon, revolved around a reflective hot air balloon and gondola that transformed into a kinetic light sculpture. The balloon sculpture was featured in a series of happenings that took place in July 2019 across the state of Massachusetts. Another project was Underwater Pavilions (2016), which consisted of three temporary sculptures that were moored to the ocean floor off Catalina Island, CA. Geometric in design, the sculptures created environments that reflected and refracted light, opening a portal that physically connected a viewer to the expanse of the ocean while simultaneously disrupting preconceived visual ideas of the aquatic world. By merging the language of contemporary architecture, land art, and ocean research and conservation, the Underwater Pavilions were a living artwork within a vibrant ecosystem. In contrast to areas of the sculpture that have a rough and rock- like surface, mirrored sections reflected the seascape and, when approached, activated to become a kaleidoscopic observatory. The environments created by the sculptures changed and adjusted with the currents and time of day, focusing the attention of the viewer on the rhythm of the ocean and its life cycles. The artwork created a variety of converging perceptual encounters that played with the fluidity of time and space, resulting in a heightened awareness of the physical world. The sculptures were created in partnership with Parley for the Oceans and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Another site-specific project, titled Mirage, premiered at Desert X, near Palm Springs, CA from February 25 - April 30, 2017, and evolved with presentations in Detroit, MI, as Mirage Detroit (2018), and Switzerland as Mirage Gstaad (2019). =Video installations= Since the mid-1990s, Aitken has created installations by employing multiple screens in architecturally provocative environments. diamond sea (1997), for example, includes three video projections, one suspended video monitor, and one full-color, illuminated transparency photograph in a dimly lit space. Multiple speakers create an immersive sound experience; the multi-screen film explores a guarded region in the Namib desert in southwestern Africa known as Diamond Area 1 and 2. The territory, estimated at over 40,000 square miles and sealed off since 1908, contains the world's largest and richest computer-controlled diamond mine. Hysteria (1998‚Äì2000) uses film footage from the past four decades that shows audiences at pop and rock concerts working themselves into a frenzy on four screens in an X formation.Remix: Contemporary Art and Pop, 24 May to 26 August 2002 Tate Liverpool. Filmed and photographed in the dusty sound stages and film sets of Bombay, Into the Sun (1999) focuses on the frenetic activity of Bollywood, recreating the sound stages of the Indian film industry with canvas projection screens, a red dirt floor, and video shown in a non-stop, twenty- four-hour loop.Doug Aitken: Into the Sun, 7 October - 12 November 1999 Victoria Miro Gallery, London. diamond sea was presented at the 1997 Whitney Biennial and his electric earth installation, an eight projection, multi-room post cinematic experience, drew international attention and earned him the International Prize at the Venice Biennale in 1999. His ambitious show New Ocean, which included multiple sound, photo, and video works, began with a transformation of the Serpentine Gallery in London and traveled the world to Austria, Italy and Japan, each time in a new configuration. In 2010, Aitken exhibited his work House, a study of destruction featuring the artist's parents. In 2017, the artist displayed a three channel video installation titled Underwater Pavilions at Art Basel Unlimited, documenting sculptures of the same name.https://www.artbasel.com/catalog/artwork/55603/Doug-Aitken- Underwater-Pavilions Recently, Aitken has shown NEW ERA, a kaleidoscopic multi-channel video installation in a mirrored hexagonal room, in various locations across the world, from New Yorkhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/doug-aitken-mirrors-our- obsession-with-mobile-technology to Zurichhttps://news.artnet.com/art- world/doug-aitken-zurich-show-1295309, Denmarkhttps://en.aros.dk/about- aros/press/2019/tomorrow-is-the-question/, Beijinghttps://www.faurschou.com/beijing/past-exhibitions/doug- aitken/installation-view-new-era/, Californiahttps://www.ucdavis.edu/news/west-coast-premiere-surrounds-viewers- transforms-them-collaborators/ and Londonhttps://www.anothermag.com/art- photography/11932/transformer-a-rebirth-of-wonder-jefferson-hack-curated- show-180-the-strand. The artwork maps the creation of the cellular telephone into a landscape of repetition and philosophical reckoning with its effect on the world.https://www.wallpaper.com/art/doug-aitken-new-era-martin-cooper =Outdoor film installations= In 1998, Glass Horizon, an installation comprising a projection of a pair of eyes onto the facade of the Vienna Secession building after it had closed for the night, showcased an interest in architectural structures and in art that interacts with urban environments.In a First, ‚ÄòSleepwalkers' Lights Up MoMA's Facade - January 17, 2007 - The New York Sun In 2001, Aitken's exhibition at London's Serpentine Gallery used the entire building for the complex installation New Ocean including transforming the museum's tower into a functional lighthouse at night.Adventures in white space Showbiz  This is London In 2004, after having worked together in Berlin, Doug Aitken and Klaus Biesenbach co-curated Hard Light, a group exhibition at MoMA PS1. In the winter of 2007, Aitken's large-scale installation Sleepwalkers, curated by Klaus Biesenbach in collaboration with Creative Time, was presented at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The project included actors such as Donald Sutherland and Tilda Swinton, as well as musicians Seu Jorge and Cat Power. Five interlocking vignettes shown through eight projections were displayed upon the exterior walls of the museum so as to be visible from the street. Concurrent with the exhibition, Aitken also presented a \\"happening\\" inside the museum that featured live drummers and auctioneers, and a performance by Cat Power. In the same year, he created an interactive music table: \\"k-n-o-c-k-o-u-t\\". In 2008, Aitken produced another large scale outdoor film installation, titled Migration for the 55th Carnegie International show titled \\"Life on Mars\\" in Pittsburgh, PA. The first installment in a three-part trilogy entitled Empire, the work features migratory wild animals of North America as they pass through and curiously inhabit empty and desolate hotel rooms. Continuing Aitken's work in large scale outdoor video installation, his artwork \\"SONG 1\\" (2012), created for the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, challenged the standard of public art in Washington D.C. The artwork, which deconstructed the popular song \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\", created a 360 degree screen out of the circular facade of the museum. Rather than using a more typical concave surface for such a projection, Aitken projected the film onto the convex exterior of the museum creating a cinema experience that required moving around the building and could never be fully seen from any one location. Another example of what the artist has called 'liquid architecture', his freestanding installation ALTERED EARTH (2012) explores the Camargue region of southern France in a maze-like flowing arrangement of twelve large projections in the hangar-like Grande Halle of the Parc des Ateliers in Arles. The work also inspired an app created by the artist and POST for the Apple iPad. Commissioned by art patron Bagley Wright, Mirror (2013) is a large LED screen, wrapped around the corner of the Seattle Art Museum, with thin strips of vertical lights. For the project, Aitken had been filming for the project over five years, capturing images of central Seattle as well as the surrounding area. A computer program selects which parts of the footage to project in response to a live feed of information that ranges from the weather to the density of traffic in the streets of Seattle.Charlotte Burns (March 1, 2013), Seattle to unveil Doug Aitken‚Äôs digital Land Art The Art Newspaper. =Conversations= In 2006, Aitken produced Broken Screen: 26 Conversations with Doug Aitken (Distributed Art Publishers, 2006), a book of interviews with twenty-six artists who aim to explore and challenge the conventions of linear narrative. Interviews included Robert Altman, Claire Denis, Werner Herzog, Rem Koolhaas, Kenneth Anger and others. The Idea of the West (2010) presents the collective response of 1000 people on the street who were asked ‚ÄúWhat is your idea of the West?‚Äù to create a manifesto from the quotes and comments of random individuals. Another interview project, Patterns & Repetition (2011) is a series of filmed conversations about creativity in the 21st Century in which Aitken conducts short conversations with pioneers in different artistic disciplines, including Devendra Banhart, Thomas Demand, Jack White, James Murphy, Mike Kelley, Jacques Herzog, Fischli & Weiss, Yayoi Kusama, Stephen Shore, and Dan Graham. Continuing his interest in the exchange of ideas, Aitken's work \\"THE SOURCE\\" (2012) explores the root of creativity. Six projections in a pavilion designed by David Adjaye, cycle through many more interviews with artists, architects, and musicians such as Adjaye, Liz Diller, William Eggleston, Philippe Parreno, Paolo Soleri, Tilda Swinton, and Beck among others. =Happenings= Aitken has directed many live \\"happenings\\" including his Broken Screen happenings from 2006 in Los Angeles and New York.http://atc.berkeley.edu/bio/Doug_Aitken/ In 2009, Aitken orchestrated a real-time opera titled \\"the handle comes up, the hammer comes down\\" that assembled auctioneers performing against the rhythms of his Sonic Table, at Il Tempo del Postino, at Theater Basel. Also in 2009, along with his large-scale video installation, Frontier, presented on the Tiber river's Isola Tiberina in the heart of Rome, Aitken staged a happening by the same title. The film featured a protagonist played by the iconic American artist Ed Ruscha, as he's seen caught in a landscape between fiction and non-fiction. The work creates a futuristic journey from day to night in a world where reality is put into question.The Art NewspaperFrieze Magazine In the happening, performers from the film, such as a professional whip cracker, come alive in the installation while surrounded by the audience. First shown at the Deste Foundation‚Äôs project space \\"Slaughterhouse\\" on the Greek island of Hydra, Black Mirror is displayed on five screens reflected ‚Äúinto infinity‚Äù across black mirrors and stars Chlo√´ Sevigny tethered only by brief conversations over the phone and through voiceover in such disparate locales as Mexico, Greece, and Central America.Fan Zhong (June 2011), June 20: Doug Aitken's Black Mirror W Magazine \\"Black Mirror\\" was also a four-night event staged on a custom barge, again featuring a performers from the film: Leo Gallo, Tim McAfee-Lewis, No Age, and Chlo√´ Sevigny.https://pitchfork.com/news/42525-no-age-score-live-art-project-with- chloe-sevigny/ =Photographs, light boxes, and sculptures= Aitken is well known for his many photographs, which often explore spatial and temporal disruption and narrative suggestion like his installations. For example, Passenger, a group of still photographs made in 1999, shows planes in flight, most of which focus on the faint traceries of takeoffs and landings over desolate airport landscapes.Doug Aitken: Passenger (2004) Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art. More recently, Aitken has created aluminum light boxes that combine photographic image and text. Extending the theme of text and image, Aitken has produced sculptures from materials as diverse as plants inside clear acrylic and kaleidoscopic mirrors. Other sculptures, such as sunset (black and white), 2012, employ the use of hand- carved foam, epoxy and hand silk-screened acrylic. =Sound experiments= Interested in the uneasy intersection of nature and culture or narrative variability, the artist has incorporated into his scores what he calls \\"field recordings,\\" such as jungle noises from Jonestown, Guyana (in his 1995 monsoon), and the reverberations of tremors generated by the eruption of the Soufri√®re Hills volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat (in eraser, 1998). In 1996, for the public art organization Creative Time, Aitken conceived an installation piece in the Anchorage, a cavernous space inside the base of the Brooklyn Bridge, that used recordings of the traffic noises overhead. In 2004, he completed a sound sculpture for the Barcelona Pavilion composed of a central post supporting a few sweeping steel branches that rotated while highly directional speakers at the end of each branch played snippets of scripted conversation. In October 2009, Aitken's Sonic Pavilion opened to the public. The pavilion is located in the forested hills of Brazil, at Inhotim. The Sonic Pavilion provides a communal space to listen to the sounds of the earth as they are recorded through highly sensitive microphones buried close to a mile deep into the ground and carried back into the pavilion through a number of speakers. The sound heard inside the pavilion is the amplified sound of the moving interior of the earth.New York Times Aitken has collaborated on his films with a wide variety of musicians, from hip hop artist Andr√© 3000 of Outkast, who was in Aitken's 2002 multiscreen Interiors to indie bands like Lichens and No Age, which contributed to his score for his 2008 film Migration and 2011's Black Mirror, respectively. =Books= Aitken is also a producer of innovative books: I AM A BULLET: Scenes from an Accelerating Culture (2000) a collaboration with writer Dean Kuipers; Doug Aitken: A-Z Book (Fractals) (2003), the alphabet serves as structure to arrange Aitken's photography and video work, along with texts and interviews; Broken Screen (2005), a book of interviews with 26 artists pushing the limits of linear narrative; Alpha, published in 2005 by the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Sleepwalkers (2007), published by the Museum of Modern Art, in correspondence to the film and video installation of the same name; 99 Cent Dreams (2008), a collection of photographs that captures \\"moments between interaction\\" to create a 21st-century nomadic travelogue;99 Cent Dreams, published by the Aspen Art Press, 2008, Write In Jerry Brown President (2008), a folded artist book published by the Museum of Modern Art,;Doug Aitken Victoria Miro Gallery, London.

Two monograph style books contain comprehensive information on the artist's career: Doug Aitken: 100 YRS, published by Rizzoli http://www.rizzoliusa.com/book.php?isbn=9780847838325 and Doug Aitken: Electric Earth, published by Prestel.https://prestelpublishing.randomhouse.de/book/Doug-Aitken/Philippe- Vergne/Prestel-com/e508275.rhd =Station to Station= Station to Station is a nomadic ‚ÄúHappening‚Äù that first occurred in the fall of 2013 on a transcontinental train. It functioned as a moving platform for artistic experimentation stopping in cities, towns and remote locations across America. An artist-created project, Station to Station embraced constantly changing stories, unexpected encounters, and creative collisions between music, art and film. The project had the support of a wide range of institutions including MoMA PS1, Carnegie Museum of Art, MCA Chicago, Walker Art Center, SITE Santa Fe, LACMA and SFMOMA. All event proceeds went to fund multi-museum arts programs throughout 2014. Art works and musical performances changed with every stop. The train traveled from New York City to San Francisco, making a total of 9 stops at train stations across the country - New York; Pittsburgh; Chicago; Minneapolis/St. Paul; Santa Fe/Lamy, New Mexico; Winslow, Arizona; Barstow, California; Los Angeles; and Oakland.https://pitchfork.com/news/51242-savages-dirty-projectors-ariel-pink- no-age-more-join-doug-aitkens-station-to-station-train-tour/ The project acted as a studio and cultural incubator, creating unplanned moments and artistic collisions.

Food was provided by Alice Waters and the Edible Schoolyard Project and chef Leif Hedendal. From June 27- July 26, 2015, Aitken staged Station to Station: A 30 Day Happening at the Barbican Centre in London. Envisioned as a living exhibition, the entire multi-arts facility was turned into a large scale multi-disciplinary event, with more than 100 artists, including Olafur Eliasson, Martin Creed, and Terry Riley.https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/25/barbican-station-to- station-art-exhibition-doug-aitkenhttp://www.barbican.org.uk/stationtostation On August 21, 2015, a feature film directed by Aitken, shot with footage from the 2013 happenings, titled Station to Station, premiered in Los Angeles.

Manufactured by Anton Schwarzkopf and designed by Werner Stengel, the roller coaster opened to the public on May 8, 1976. The New Revolution is the world's first modern roller coaster to feature a vertical loop and has been recognized for that accomplishment by American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE), who awarded the roller coaster its Coaster Landmark status.ACE Coaster Landmark Awards. However, there were earlier examples of roller coasters with a full vertical loop, such as the steel roller coaster called \\"Looping the Loop\\" in Parque Japon√©s in Buenos Aires, which operated from 1911 to 1930. The coaster was named after the American Revolution in celebration of the country's Bicentennial. Unlike many of the previous looping roller coasters in the 19th and early-20th centuries which attempted circular loops, Revolution's success was dependent on a clothoid-shaped vertical loop ‚Äì a first in the industry. In 2016, the coaster received a makeover for its 40th anniversary that included new trains with lap bars and an optional virtual reality experience for riders. The New Revolution soft-launched to season pass holders on March 26, 2016, and opened to the general public on April 21, 2016. History =Great American Revolution= In the mid-1970s, Magic Mountain enlisted ride manufacturer Anton Schwarzkopf and legendary designer Werner Stengel to design and build the first looping roller coaster in modern times. The last known existence of one was Loop the Loop at Coney Island during the early 1900s. Prior to Great American Revolution's opening, a week of testing was needed to properly calibrate the tightness of the wheels, in order to get the train to complete one full circuit. At the ride's opening, staff operating the ride were outfitted with Continental Army-style uniforms to match the time period of the American Revolution, which the country was celebrating for its Bicentennial. =La Revoluci√≥n, Revolution= In 1979 following the purchase of the park by Six Flags, the ride's name was changed to La Revoluci√≥n in honor of the Mexican Revolution. In 1988, the ride's name was changed once more to simply Revolution. In June 2002, a Coaster Landmark plaque awarded by American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) was placed near the line queue in front of the ride. The award was presented in recognition of its accomplishment as the world's first modern vertical-looping roller coaster. In 2005, parts of Revolution had to be dismantled to make way for the park's new Tatsu roller coaster that was being constructed. Revolution reopened with Tatsu on the new coaster's media day on May 11, 2006. =The New Revolution= On September 3, 2015, Six Flags announced that Revolution would be refurbished for the 2016 season marking the roller coaster's 40th anniversary. Its track was painted white and blue, and the ride received new red, white, and blue trains with the lead cars of each train featuring a silver eagle ornament mounted on the front. The new trains were also fitted with lap and calf bars; the elimination of the highly criticized over-the-shoulder restraints was intended to provide a smoother, more comfortable ride experience with additional airtime. The ride reopened with the name of The New Revolution. New seats on the New Revolution Six Flags announced on March 3, 2016, that The New Revolution would be among several rides at various parks that would receive a virtual reality (VR) upgrade. Riders had the option to wear Samsung Gear VR headsets, powered by Oculus, to create a 360-degree, 3D experience while riding. The illusion was themed to a fighter jet, where riders flew through a futuristic city as co- pilots battling alien invaders. The feature debuted with the coaster when it emerged from refurbishment and reopened to season pass holders on March 26, 2016. It reopened to the general public on April 21, 2016. On February 8, 2017, Six Flags announced that The New Revolution would offer a new VR experience known as The New Revolution Galactic Attack. It was billed as the world's first mixed Virtual Reality Experience powered by Oculus VR. The experience was centered around an alien invasion in space. As riders crest the lift hill, the setting changed into an intergalactic battle seen from the cockpit of a fighter spaceship. It became available to the public on February 25. Beginning on November 18, 2017, Six Flags debuted a new VR experience to match the \\"Holiday in the Park\\" theme. Dubbed \\"Santa's Wild Sleigh Ride,\\" it placed riders in Santa's sleigh as he delivered presents to a snowy town. https://www.dailynews.com/2017/11/10/six-flags-magic-mountains-holiday-in-the- park-offers-santa-and-steampunk-for-2017/ The VR option was extremely popular, causing 2-3 hour lines. The headsets would overheat and make the lines even longer. Therefore, the headsets were moved to Lex Luthor's Drop of Doom in 2018. With the VR feature removed, the ride now operates in \\"Classic Revolution\\" mode. Incidents Vertical Loop at night On May 31, 1996, a park employee was hit and killed instantly while attempting to cross the tracks in the boarding station as a train was returning. The investigation determined she slipped and fell into a pit below, crossing from the side where passengers exit over to the opposite side. On June 12, 2015, a 10-year-old girl riding the roller coaster was found breathing but unconscious after returning to the station. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and died the following day. According to the local coroner's office, she died of natural causes unrelated to the ride. An autopsy wasn't performed to determine the exact cause, at the request of the girl's family. In popular culture Revolution was prominently featured in the climax of the 1977 suspense thriller Rollercoaster. The 1978 cult film Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park features the rollercoaster throughout the movie. It was also featured in the episode \\"Phantom of the Roller Coaster\\" in season three of Wonder Woman. The coaster is also featured in the 1979 film Van Nuys Blvd and in the 1983 movie National Lampoon's Vacation as the Whipper Snapper.

In the early years of the U.S. Open, the club hosted it four times: 1898, 1901, 1905, and 1908. History Myopia Hunt Club was founded in 1882 by J. Murray Forbes. The golf course was designed and built by Herbert C. Leeds in 1894 and he continued working at the Club for over 30 years. Leeds tied for seventh place in the 1898 U.S. Open held at Myopia Hunt Club. His familiarity with the course was no doubt a factor in his ability to finish so high on the leaderboard in the tournament. The name \\"Myopia\\" is due to some of its founding members having come from the Myopia Club in Winchester, Massachusetts, which had been founded by four brothers with poor vision, or myopia. Today, the Myopia Hunt Club is a drag hunt, meaning that the hounds follow a laid scent rather than live fox. When completed, Myopia Hunt Club measured 6,539 yards and Leeds made certain that golfers would encounter a multitude of challenging features, including tall mounds, deep bunkers, lightning-fast greens, blind shots requiring substantial carry, deep swales, punishing rough, plateaued greens, as well as a pond and paddock to avoid. So difficult was the course that in the 1901 U.S. Open not a single professional was able to break 80 in any round. Polo Myopia also features one of the oldest continually running polo fields in the nation. Gibney Field, formerly used as a pasture, was mowed and used for practice in the summer of 1888. That fall, Myopia held its first official match against the Dedham Polo and Country Club.Sport in Norfolk County by Allan Forbes. Houghton Mifflin, Boston. 1938.American Polo by Newell Bent. The MacMillan Company, 1929. In 1890, Myopia became one of seven charter members of the Polo Association, now the United States Polo Association. Of those seven original clubs, Myopia is one of two still in existence; Meadowbrook on Long Island is the other. It is the only one that still uses its original field.United States Polo Association Blue Book, 2013. Gibney Field is not, however, the oldest continuously used polo field in the nation. That honor goes to Aiken Polo Club's Whitney Field‚Äîin Aiken, South Carolina‚Äîwhich was first used for polo in a gala exhibition match in 1882. Aiken Polo Club joined the Polo Association in 1899.Life and Sport in Aiken, by Harry Worcester Smith. Derrydale Press, New York. 1935.United States Polo Association Blue Book, 2013. Polo is still played at Myopia throughout the summer season, from Memorial Day until Columbus Day. Sunday afternoon games at 3 p.m. are open to the public for a small fee. In 1902 a real tennis court was opened at the Myopia Hunt Club, but has since been converted to other uses. Golf Myopia Hunt Club is the only course in the United States to have been listed by Golf Magazine as having two of the United States's top 100 signature holes, Myopia's fourth and ninth. The U.S. Open was held at the Club in 1898, 1901, 1905, and 1908. The 72-hole winning score in 1901 by Willie Anderson, one of only four four-time champions, was 331, a record high that still stands today. He defeated Alex Smith in an 18-hole playoff, 85 to 86, his highest 18-hole score of the tournament. The first nine was completed in 1896, but the second nine was not finished until October, 1898,<\\\\ ref Boston Globe, October 10, 1898, p.2.> so the June, 1898 U.S. Open was actually played over eight rounds of nine holes. =Myopia Hunt Club scorecard= none From 1995‚Äì2005, the course underwent a series of major improvements under the leadership of Club president Michael Greene. Greene, along with Captain of Golf Steve Warhover (and with the consent of the voting members of the Club), lengthened the course with several new tees. These were installed on the 2nd, 4th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 15th, and 18th holes. In addition, many trees throughout the course were removed and replaced with traditional mounds, better fitting the historic design of Herbert Corey Leeds. Myopia Hunt Club was the home course of the late novelist and golf writer John Updike.John Updike, \\"The Yankee Golfer,\\" Golf Dreams (N.Y., Knopf, 1996), p. 193.

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the Floorless Coaster model was the park's sixteenth roller coaster and is located in the Screampunk District area of the park. The ride consists of a series of roller coaster elements including seven inversions ranging from a zero-g roll to interlocking corkscrews. The ride is a mirror image of Bizarro at Six Flags Great Adventure. History In 1999, Six Flags Great Adventure spent $42 million on new attractions including a prototype Floorless Coaster, Medusa (later renamed Bizarro), developed and built by Bolliger & Mabillard. The immediate popularity of the ride led to several parks installing Floorless Coasters in the early 2000s. In November 2002, parts for Scream began arriving at Six Flags Magic Mountain. On November 14, 2002, the park officially announced that they would be adding Scream for the 2003 season, making it the park's sixteenth roller coaster. According to the park, the ride was added to fill the \\"missing link to our coaster collection\\". After five months construction, Scream officially opened to the public on April 12, 2003. On April 9, 2004, a park employee was killed when they were hit by one of Scream's trains during an after-hours test run. According to a statement issued by the park, the employee \\"deviated from safety training procedures and walked underneath the ride\\". The ride was closed immediately pending clearance by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The administration cleared the ride for operation within two weeks. In 2015, the coaster received a brand new color scheme of blue track and orange supports for the opening of Twisted Colossus. Characteristics =Statistics= The Scream stands tall. With a top speed of , the ride features seven inversions including a vertical loop, a dive loop, a zero-g roll, a cobra roll and two interlocking corkscrews. Although the ride is a mirrored clone of the first Floorless Coaster (Medusa/Bizarro at Six Flags Great Adventure), they feature a slight difference in height of about and a difference in speed of . =Trains= Scream operates with three floorless trains. Each train seats 32 riders in eight rows of four. This gives the ride a theoretical capacity of 1,440 riders per hour. The open-air trains feature seats which leave riders' legs dangling above the track. Riders are restrainted with over-the-shoulder restraints. As the trains are floorless, the station has a retractable floor for safe boarding. The third train of the ride is painted blue and orange. Ride experience Once the train is loaded and secured, the floor is retracted and the train departs the station. A U-turn to the right leads to the chain lift hill. Once riders reach the top, they go through a small pre-drop before dropping to the right. The train then reaches a top speed of and enters the vertical loop followed by a turn to the left into the dive loop. After the diving loop, the train passes the station and goes through a zero-g roll, where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness. The train then goes through the cobra roll, a roller coaster element which inverts riders twice. Riders then enter the mid-course brake run which is located next to the lift hill. The train drops out of the brake run to the right and enters a 270-degree helix followed by the two interlocking corkscrews. Riders go through a small dip then enter the final brake run before returning to the station. Reception Screams lift hill and interlocking corkscrews, with a former parking lot below The reception of Scream has been mixed. Arthur Levine of About.com gives the ride 4 out of 5 stars. He states \\"it's remarkably smooth, loaded with airtime, and has plenty of surprises to warrant its name\\". Levine did criticise the lack of theming and landscaping around the ride noting the immediate area surrounding the ride \\"includes a bone yard of coaster seats and parts\\". Robert Niles of the Los Angeles Times shared a similar sentiment, stating \\"Scream creates an effective illusion that you are alone, flying above the track\\" but questions the ride's location on a former parking lot. He highlights \\"a good story can elicit extreme thoughts and emotions. [...] Why ignore those opportunities when building a thrill ride?\\". Niles concluded by stating \\"I feel a little neglected as I shuffle off the otherwise exciting ride\\", referring to the lack of theming or storyline. Lynn Arave of the Deseret News praised the ride, rating it alongside the Riddler's Revenge for the best rides in the park. Scream has never featured in Amusement Today's annual Golden Ticket Awards top 50 steel roller coasters. The mirrored clone at Six Flags Great Adventure peaked at position 16 in its debut year before ranking a further six times in the list.

Notification Services offers a scalable server engine on which to run notification applications, with multi- server capability-providing flexibility and scalability for deploying applications. Notification Services was designed to ease the pain of developing and deploying notification applications that generate personalized, timely information to subscribers. To design, code and test all of the components that make up a robust Notification Services Application-such as notification scheduling, failure detection, retry logic, time zone management, notification grouping, and queue management, adding Notification Services to software applications can be a daunting task. Background Over the years the term Notification applications has been superseded with the term Complex Event Processing (CEP). The idea is that the user defines a set of Rules (or Queries) in advance, and then push data through those rules. Should the data fit any of the criteria of the Rules then some action is fired. For example: A rule may state \\"If car speed through sensor is above 100 km/h, take photo and record\\" otherwise all other data is discarded. This approach is much faster than the traditional OLTP design of; Insert the row(s) into the database while constantly polling the data to see if something relevant has happened. It is especially suited to situations where you have high speed inputs, a fixed set of fairly simple queries and may not need to keep all the data. e.g.: Some industries measure the voltage, current and other attributes of hundreds of electric motors in their conveyor belts, 100 times each second. Then compare each measurement to its average, plant operators are alerted should a sudden change occur. Release history SQL Server Notification Services was one of the many components that comprised Microsoft SQL Server. It was first released in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 2 (2003). An enhanced release shipped in SQL Server 2005. It was discontinued and removed from SQL Server 2008, although SQL Server 2005 SP3 allows for the Notification Services components to be run against the SQL Server 2008 Database Engine. It has been replaced by StreamInsight which first shipped as a component of SQL 2008 R2. StreamInsight is a separate install and not visible as a part of a regular SQL Server setup. Extensibility and programmability A programming framework based on Transact-SQL and XML, provides a declarative programming model, and lends itself to quick prototyping and deployment of robust notification applications. An API for creating subscription management applications is provided, plus standard components for collecting event data from files and SQL Server databases, for formatting notifications using XSLT, and for sending notifications via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) or by writing notifications to a file. If the standard components do not meet the needs of an application, Notification Services is extendable by building custom components using the .NET family of programming languages, such as Microsoft Visual C# .NET and Microsoft Visual Basic .NET. Finally, Notification Services can communicate with a wide variety of Microsoft, third-party, and custom- built event providers and delivery protocols, enabling Notification Services to communicate with existing systems in heterogeneous environments.

A typical example of karst polje encircled by tall peaks and mountain ranges, the field is characterized by many unique natural phenomenons and karstic features.  Geography  The field has an area of 45,868 hectare, 458.7 km¬≤, and an average width of 6 km. It is located at an average height of 720 m above sea level. The field is located in region of Tropolje, in the southwest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and lies between the karstic mountains of Dinara and Kame≈°nica on the south, Tu≈°nica mountain on the east, Cincar and Golija mountain on the north and ≈†ator and Staretina mountain on the west. Bu≈°ko Blato (Bu≈°ko lake) lies to the southeast, and ≈Ωdralovac to the northwest. ≈Ωdralovac is a narrow corridor by which the Livno field is connected to the Grahovsko field, between the slopes of mountains Dinara, Kame≈°nica and ≈†ator. = Climate = In the Neolithic age, the field was underwater. On the field itself there remains several lakes, of which Bu≈°ko Blato has the largest accumulation in the region. Bre≈æinsko jezero is another lake of note which lies on the northwest part of the field. When the Orlovac Hydroelectric power-plant was built in the 1960s, it altered the climate of the entire Livno region. Long, cold winter months with large snowfalls with the characteristic bura wind, were replaced by rainy winters and long, warm summers. = Hydrology and hydrography = Across the Livanjsko field flow several rivers, which belong to the Adriatic watershed. The most important of these are the ≈Ωabljak, the Sturba, the Bistrica, the Brina, the Plovuƒça, the Jaruga and the Riƒçina which are all rich in trout and crab. An artificial lake, Bu≈°ko Blato, was dammed in the polje in the 1970s for electric power generation. Additional projects are in planning which could seriously compromise the delicate hydrological balance of the Dinaric karst, which is criss-crossed by underground rivers. = Towns and villages = The largest town on the field is Livno, from which the field received its name. The town of Livno has approximately 12,000 inhabitants. It is located on the northeastern part of the field, beneath mount Ba≈°ajkovac. The largest villages on the field are Guber, Grborezi, Podhum, Prolog, ƒåukliƒá, Zabri≈°ƒáe, Bila, ƒåelebiƒá, Lusniƒá, Strupniƒá, Kovaƒçiƒá, Vrbica and Bojmunte.  Culture and history  Old Livno fortress (Bistrica town), the historic site = Organic agriculture and cuisine = The field is home to continental vegetable culture such as potatoes and cabbage. Livestock, especially raising cattle and sheep, as well as the production of milk and two famous brand of delicacy cheese, simply known as Livanjski cheese and Cincar cheese, employs a good deal of the inhabitants of the field.

Several nationally syndicated programs are carried at night, including Mark Levin, Armstrong & Getty, Red Eye Radio and America in The Morning from Westwood One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media, the parent company of KMJ-AM-FM. Weekends feature shows on money, health, real estate, auto repair and dining. Some shows are paid brokered programming. Weekend hosts include Chris Plante, Chad Benson and Ric Edelman. Local newscasters are heard at the beginning of most hours, with Westwood One News carried at night. History =KKDJ= The station signed on the air on December 8, 1979.Broadcasting Yearbook 1981 page C-22 It was owned by Pacific Quadracasting, Inc. It was an Album-Oriented Rock (AOR) station known as \\"KKDJ 106\\". The KKDJ call letters were previously used by a rock station in Los Angeles. There was another KMJ-FM between 1949 and the 1980s, at 97.9 MHz. It was the original FM simulcast of 580 KMJ, then switched to classical music and later Top 40, before becoming today's KMGV. KKDJ was the leading rock station in Fresno throughout the 1980s, largely due to the popularity of KKDJ's morning show, The Dean and Don's Breakfast Club. Dean was also known as Bobby Volare and Don as Donnie Rotten. The Dean and Don's Breakfast Club had an avid following in Fresno during the late 1970s and early 1980s. KKDJ also brought 1980s concert acts such as The Knack, Huey Lewis and the News, the Motels and the Babys to the Star Palace and Warner's Theatre. In 1980, Dean and Don along with their co-host Jimmy Michaels recruited the KKDJ 106 Cheerleaders, eight women and one man. The applicants had to submit a written essay of why they wanted to become a KKDJ 106 Cheerleader. The hip and sexy 1980s cheer team was recruited to promote concerts and other events, hosted by the Breakfast Club. Some of the team members include; Susan \\"Sexy Susan \\" Johnson, Rebecca \\"Becky Baby\\" Perryman, Mayer \\"Mary Maybe\\" Daher, Julie \\"Jules\\" Contreras, with Susan \\"Sassy Sue\\" Riley, and Cecelia \\"Lusty Lolita\\". Other KKDJ 106 DJs at the station during this time included Jeffrey D. Reidel, Michael \\"Mike The Wild Kingdom\\" Wild, with David \\"Dead Air Dave\\" Sozinho, and Sue Delany. Dean's weekend show was called Dean Opperman's Off-Ramp to Nowhere. KKDJ's dominance as a rocker was hurt when 103.7 KMGX changed its format from Top 40 to hard- edged rock in 1989, as KRZR (today KFBT). In 1991, KKDJ changed its format from album rock to alternative rock under the nickname \\"105.9 The Edge\\". This format lasted until January 1994. =Spanish ballads and hot talk= When Henry Broadcasting acquired KKDJ, it was relocated from its studios on Shaw Avenue to a small trailer in the KSKS/KMJ parking lot, a trailer previously used by sister station KDON-FM for live remotes. Henry Broadcasting also changed the format of KKDJ to Classic Rock, to compete with KJFX. In 1996, KKDJ's format changed again, this time to Spanish soft ballads as KRNC, \\"Romance 106.\\" That evolved into a more uptempo Spanish Hits format as \\"Viva 106.\\" The Latino format was replaced in 2004 by a hot talk format known as \\"The Edge,\\" with the call sign KKDG, featuring Howard Stern's syndicated show in the morning. The talk format barely made a dent in the ratings, and Spanish pop \\"Viva 106\\" was temporarily revived, while still running Howard Stern in AM drive time. =Jack-FM= In September 2005, the format was changed again to adult hits as an affiliate of the Jack FM format, rebranded as \\"105.9 Jack FM,\\" and changing its call sign to KFJK. Jack-FM was among the highest-rated stations in the Fresno market for several years, due to its large playlist, made up of rock, alternative and pop hits from the past and present, as well as its own unique system of playing these songs at random, hence the slogan, \\"Playing What We Want.\\" In addition, Jack had no DJs, which was heavily promoted. One station announcement said, \\"You don't hear someone talk in between songs on a CD, so why would you hear someone talk in between songs on the radio?\\" In response to the success of KFJK, in December 2006, KWYE changed its format, which had previously been Top 40. =News/Talk KMJ-FM= Jack FM's popularity declined by 2009, eventually ranking 15th (out of 38).Talk radio format takes over KFJK - TV - fresnobee.com On March 26, 2009, KFJK changed its format to news/talk, branded as \\"KMJ Now,\\" in tandem with KMJ 580 AM. On March 27, 2009, KFJK changed its call letters to KMJ-FM. KMJ-FM's switch to talk created the region's fifth such station. At first KMJ-AM and FM shared only some programs, but today the two stations are fully simulcast.

Viper is the last operating roller coaster with seven inversions to be built by American manufacturer Arrow Dynamics. The other two, Shockwave at Six Flags Great America and the Great American Scream Machine at Six Flags Great Adventure, were demolished in 2002 and 2010, respectively. The roller coaster replaced a HUSS ride type named Condor. History In November 1989, Six Flags Magic Mountain announced that Viper would be added to the park. The ride opened on April 7, 1990. A week after opening, Viper was shut down. Inspectors found weak links in the long chain. Instead of replacing the links, a new chain had to be ordered. A trim brake was also installed after the first loop. The ride would reopen a few days later. In August 2018, Viper closed for an extended refurbishment.https://www.thecoasterkings.com/six-flags-magic-mountain-update- august-15th-2018/ On December 22, 2018, Viper reopened to the public with new modifications. Ride experience Upon exiting the station, the train immediately begins climbing the lift hill. At the top, the train curves into the drop and enters a tall vertical loop. The train then makes a sharp left, entering two vertical loops and climbing into the mid-course brake run, followed by a zig-zag into a Batwing element, where it goes through a half- corkscrew followed by a half loop. Next, the train goes up into another half loop and half corkscrew so that it returns in the opposite direction. Riders are photographed by an on-ride camera in the middle of this element. Riders then make a right turn and immediately enter a double corkscrew which inverts riders twice. The ride leads into a flat section of track followed by an s-curve drop and rise into the final brake run before turning right into the station. Records When Viper opened in 1990, it was the tallest and fastest looping coaster in the world. Its speed record was eclipsed the following year by Steel Phantom at Kennywood, which opened in 1991 with a top speed of , but it regained the speed record in 2000 when Steel Phantom closed. The height record for the tallest vertical loop was until 2000 with the opening of Superman Krypton Coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. In media Viper was featured in the 1992 film Encino Man, in which it was referred to as \\"Vaper\\". Viper also made appearances in the 1993 film True Romance and the 2000 film Space Cowboys, as well as in commercials for Toyota and Cheetos. Viper was featured in a 1993 episode of Beverly Hills, 90210, \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\", in which the cast goes to Magic Mountain on Senior Skip Day and Andrea conquers her fear of roller coasters. In 2012, it appeared in Glee's Big Brother episode when the cast rides it during their visit to the park on senior ditch day. The song \\"Up, Up, Up\\" is sung over the experience. The coaster appears in the video game RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 as part of a recreation of the Six Flags Magic Mountain park. Viper was also featured in Lucifer season 3, episode 25, when the character Dan rides it after being trapped by one of the suspects in that episode.

Early life Electra Havemeyer was born on August 16, 1888. She was the youngest child of Henry Osborne Havemeyer (1847‚Äì1907), President of the American Sugar Refining Company, and Louisine Elder (1855‚Äì1929). She had two older siblings, Adaline Havemeyer (1884‚Äì1963), who married Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen, and Horace Havemeyer (1886‚Äì1956), who married Doris Dick Havemeyer. Her paternal grandparents were Frederick Christian Havemeyer Jr. (1807-1891), and Sarah Louise Henderson Havemeyer (1812-1851). Her maternal grandparents were merchant George W. Elder (1831‚Äì1873) and his wife, Matilda Adelaide Waldron (1834‚Äì1907). She attended Miss Spence's School and traveled with her family to the American West, France, Italy, Spain, Egypt, Greece and Austria, but did not attend college. Career During World War I, Electra Webb drove an ambulance in New York City, and was named Assistant Director of the Motor Corps. In 1942, during World War II she joined the Civilian Defense Volunteer Organization, and directed the Pershing Square Civil Defense Center and its blood bank. =Collector= Although she spent her youth among the finest examples of European and Asian material culture, Electra Havemeyer Webb's own collecting took a radical turn. Although she lived with more than twenty extremely fine Impressionist works from her parents' collection in a penthouse at 740 Park Avenue during part of the year, she decorated a small pink farmhouse on portion of her in-laws' estate with the simple New England furniture and craftwork. Quilts, tiger maple furniture, and hooked rugs filled the homey rooms of her country house. Although a woman of tremendous means, Webb's Vermont home was modest and comfortable in scale. Her \\"Brick House\\" survives today as a rare and intact example of the Colonial Revival, providing an intimate glimpse into the life of a pioneer collector of America and founder of the Shelburne Museum. The home was in the Webb family until 2000 when the structure and its contents were acquired by the museum. Following a 4.4 million dollar campaign by the museum to restore the home to Mrs. Webb's decor, the museum was recognized by Preservation Trust of Vermont in 2005 for their efforts in preserving the Brick House. Since 2004, it has been open to the public by reservation for guided tours during the summer months. =Shelburne Museum= Louisine Havemeyer and her Daughter Electra, 1895 pastel on paper by Mary Cassatt. Collection of Shelburne Museum The closing of one of the Webb's other homes, this one near the polo grounds at Old Westbury, unintentionally birthed a museum. The question of what would become of her cigar store Indians, hunting decoys, and weather vanes had to be settled. In 1947 Electra Havemeyer Webb gathered with her friends to create Shelburne Museum. Located near Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont, Webb's museum became a haven for the handmade objects of another era. A two-hundred-year-old tavern shelters one of the finest collections of weathervanes, trade signs, and primitive portraits on the continent. A rambling old farmhouse is filled with spectacular assemblages of mochaware, pewter, and staffordshire. The finest collection of carriages and sleighs in North America rests in a unique horseshoe barn. Period homes, filled with outstanding collections of early American furniture and accessories, dot the grounds. Rather than confine her eclectic collections to a single modern gallery, Webb chose to create an institution that would showcase her \\"collection of collections\\" in fine examples of early American homes and public buildings. A general store, meeting house, log cabin, and a steamship dot the grounds. The entire museum reflects Electra Webb's passion for American art and design, as she treasured a variety of objects. Five rooms from her Park Avenue apartment were installed in a memorial building after her death in 1960, bringing Webb's collection of works by Monet, Manet, and Degas to the museum grounds. A large pastel by Mary Cassatt, showing a young Electra Havemeyer with her mother Louisine, enjoys a place of honor in the entry hall. Electra Havemeyer Webb began to collect \\"in earnest\\" in 1911, more than a decade before the founding of Colonial Williamsburg and nearly a half century before authentic American antiques would return to the major rooms of the White House. When she began to gather the remnants of an earlier America there was no National Register of Historic Places. Americans had yet to understand that their heritage was interesting and worthy of preservation. Before there was Henry Francis Dupont's Winterthur, Henry Ford's Greenfield Village, or even the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, Webb was an ambitious and well-known collector of Americana. She worked with the finest antique dealers of the era, including Edith Halpert and Harry Newman, to assemble encyclopedic and irreplaceable collections of American material culture. The honesty of everyday objects spoke to Webb, and she used her significant resources to ensure their preservation. Today the museum's Americana collection is one of the world's finest. Deaccession Controversy In 1996 the museum sold $30 million of her artwork, deemed non-essential to the collection, which had been in storage not visible to the public for years. This was to create a collections care endowment, to better preserve and secure the items in the collection. While the board had considered other ways to care for the items, including mergers and loaning out the collection, the final choice received some backlash in the art community. The president of the American Association of Museums refused to endorse the move arguing that the museum was unfairly conflating care for the items with security, while the director at the time argued it set a dangerous precedent for other museums doing the same. Electra Webb's son, James Watson Webb, Jr. went on the record saying that he was disappointed with the move as well. Most of the buyers were unidentified telephone bidders, but one item was sold to Stephen A. Wynn with the intent of displaying it at the Bellagio Casino. Personal life In 1910, Electra married polo champion James Watson Webb II (1884‚Äì1960) of the Vanderbilt family in an elaborate society wedding at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York.\\"Miss Havemeyer Bride of J.W. Webb: St. Bartholmew's Crowded at nuptials of Younger Daughter of Late H.O. Havemeyer\\" The New York Times, February 9, 1910. Retrieved 2010-03-28. He was a son of William Seward Webb and Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt. They had five children: * Electra Webb (1910‚Äì1982) * Samuel Webb (1912‚Äì1988) * Lila Webb(1913‚Äì1961) * James Watson Webb, Jr. (1916‚Äì2000) * Harry Webb (1922‚Äì1975). Recognizing her achievements in the museum field, Yale University awarded Electra Havemeyer Webb an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1956. She was the fifth woman to be recognized in this manner. She died on November 19, 1960 at Mary Fletcher Hospital in Burlington, Vermont. =Shelburne Farms= Electra's parents-in- law Dr. William Seward Webb and Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt had transformed a collection of rambling lakeside farms on the shore of Vermont's Lake Champlain into a model country estate. The core of property, the Shelburne Farms, survives today as a nonprofit foundation dedicated to fostering innovative agricultural practices. Recalling her first visit to the Webb estate as a young girl Webb declared \\"I felt as though I was in dreamland,\\" she was smitten by the beauty of Vermont's Champlain Valley. On the Webb estate she enjoyed horseback riding, the 113-foot steam yacht, and one of America's first private nine-hole golf courses. The pastoral landscape and lush grounds of Shelburne Farms would be replicated at Electra Havemeyer Webb's museum. Shelburne Museum is well known for its fine collection of lilacs, peonies, and New England perennials.

The poem deals with the Theban cycle and treats the war of the Seven against Thebes, who were seven champions who led an Archive army against the city of Thebes. Composition Tiepolo showing the battle of Polyneices and Eteocles, from the Ca' Dolfin Tiepolos. Based on Statius' own testimony, the Thebaid was written AD c. 80‚Äìc. 92, beginning when the poet was around 35, and the work is thought to have been published in 91 or 92.Feeney, Dennis, The Oxford Classical Dictionary (Oxford, 1996), p. 1439. According to the last verse of the poem,Theb 12.811 Statius wrote the Thebaid over the course of a dozen years during the reign of Emperor Domitian, although the symmetry of the compositional period, assigning one book per year, has been taken with suspicion by scholars.Feeney, p. 1439. The poem is divided into twelve books in imitation of Vergil's AeneidShackleton- Bailey, D. R., Statius' Thebaid 1-7 (Cambridge, 2003), p. 3. and is composed in 9,748 hexameter verses, the standard meter of Greco-Roman epics. In the Silvae, Statius speaks of his extensive work in polishing and revising the ThebaidSilv. 4.7.26. and his public recitations of the poem.Silv. 5.2.161. From the epilogueTheb. 810‚Äì19. it seems clear that Statius considered the Thebaid to be his magnum opus and believed that it would secure him fame for the future. Poetic models Statius's Thebaid deals with the same subject as the Thebaid‚Äîan early Greek epic of several thousand lines which survives only in brief fragments (also known as the Thebais), and which was attributed by some classical Greek authors to Homer. Perhaps a more important source for Statius was the long epic Thebais of Antimachus of Colophon, an important poem both in the development of the Theban cycle and the evolution of Hellenistic poetry.Bailey, p. 2. Statius' poem shows some parallels with Stesichorus' \\"Thebais\\". Also significant for Statius were the myth's many treatments in Greek drama, represented by surviving plays such as Aeschylus's Seven Against Thebes, Sophocles's Antigone, and Euripides's Phoenissae and Suppliants. Other authors provided models for specific sections of the poem; the Coroebus episode in Book 1 may be based on Callimachus's Aetia, while the Hypsipyle narrative in Book 5 echoes Apollonius of Rhodes's treatment. On the Latin side, Statius is highly indebted to Vergil, a debt he acknowledges in his epilogue.Theb. 810 ff. Statius emulates Vergil's Odyssean and Iliadic book division, concentrating aetiological material and traveling in the first six books and focusing on battle narratives in the second six, and many episodes allude to sections in the Aeneid (such as the correspondence of the Dymas and Hopleus episode to Nisus and Euryalus).Theb. 10.448, where a striking mythological simile connects the two sets of heroes. Ovid's considerable influence can be traced in Statius's handling of cosmic structure, description, style, and verse; Ovid in some ways seems to be more a model for Statius than Vergil at times.Feeney, p. 1439. The influence of Lucan can be particularly felt in Statius's penchant for macabre battle sequences, discussion of tyranny, and focus on nefas.Feeney, p. 1439. Seneca's tragedies also seem to be an influence in the Thebaid, particularly in Statius's portrayal of family relations, generational curses, necromancy, and insanity.Feeney, p. 1439. Contents oath. Book 1 The Thebaid opens with a priamel in which the poet rejects several themes dealing with Theban mythology and decides to focus on the House of Oedipus (Oedipodae confusa domus), and following this is a recusatio and a passage in praise of Domitian. The narrative begins with Oedipus' prayer to the chthonic gods and curse on his sons Polyneices and Eteocles who have rejected and mistreated him. The Fury Tisiphone hears Oedipus' prayer and ascends to the earth to fulfill the curse, causing strife between Eteocles and Polyneices (who is in exile for a year while Eteocles holds the throne of Thebes). This is followed by a council of the gods concilium deorum at which Jupiter informs the gods of his plan to involve Thebes and Argos in a war; when Juno passionately pleads for Argos, she is silenced by Jupiter's unshakable decision. Mercury is sent to the underworld to fetch the shade of Laius to drive Eteocles to war. Meanwhile, Polyneices is driven by a storm to Argos and the threshold of Adrastus's palace, where he meets Tydeus, an exile from Calydon who is also seeking shelter, and fights with him. Adrastus invites the two exiles in, feasts them, and, in fulfillment of a prophecy, offers them his daughters to marry; he then goes on the explain the aetiology of the festival the Argives are celebrating, telling the story of Apollo's purification by Crotopus and his seduction of his daughter Psamathe, which eventually leads to the death of her and her child Linus, followed by Apollo's vengeful summoning of a child-eating monster from the underworld which later was slain by Coroebus, and finally, Coroebus' offer of self-sacrifice to Apollo to end a plague at Argos. The book ends with Adrastus' prayer to Apollo. Book 2 The second book begins with Mercury's guidance of the shade of Laius to Thebes; Laius appears in the guise of Tiresias to Eteocles in a dream and drives him to refuse to allow Polyneices to become king when his year is over. Adrastus marries Polyneices to Argia and Tydeus to Deipyle in a ceremony marred by ill omens. The poet describes the necklace of Harmonia, which Argia wears to the wedding, as an object that brings its bearers bad luck and causes strife. Polyneices sends Tydeus on an embassy to Eteocles to remind him that his time of rule is over. Eteocles refuses Tydeus' request for him to give up the throne. Tydeus leaves in a rage and Eteocles sends an ambush to kill him as he returns in a mountain pass. Tydeus kills all the ambushers except Maeon so he can carry the news back to Eteocles. Tydeus then attaches the battle trophies‚Äîtaken from the slain‚Äîto an oak tree as he prays to Minerva. Book 3 Maeon returns to Thebes, reports the slaughter to Eteocles, criticizing the tyrant's behavior, and then commits suicide. The Thebans go out to survey the slaughter and bury the dead. Jupiter orders Mars to go to earth to stir up war, but Venus blocks his chariot, beseeching him to prevent the war. Mars follows Jupiter's commands and heads to earth, stirring up trouble in the cities and helping Tydeus spread the news of the battle fought. Arriving at Argos, Tydeus urges the people of the city to attack Thebes immediately, yet Adrastus takes some time to think about the best course of action. Amphiaraus and Melampus go to Aphesas to take auspices about the coming war, which portend confusion, violence, and death. Mars drives the Argives into a frenzy, and they take up arms and gather at the doors of Adrastus's palace, demanding war, and also at the door of Amphiarus's house, forcing the seer to reveal the unfavorable signs he saw at Aphesas. Argia, sympathetic to her husband Polyneices' restlessness, appeals to Adrastus to hasten the war. The king is finally moved and begins the preparations. Book 4 Book 4 opens three years after the third book. The Argives and their allies are gathered and the poet asks Fama and Vetustas to help him in the catalogue of heroes and allies. Each hero's armor and appearance are described. Adrastus and Polyneices muster the Argive forces, Tydeus the Aetolians, Hippomedon the Dorians, and Capaneus the Messenians. Amphiaraus is driven to fight by Eriphyle and leads the Spartans, while Parthenopaeus unbeknownst to his mother, Atalanta, leads the Arcadians; she tries to stop her son from joining the war, but at the end commends him to Adrastus. The Thebans reluctantly prepare for war. Because of bad omens and a maddened warning of the leader of the Bacchanals, king Eteocles consults with Tiresias. The seer claims that summoning spirits is a more certain way of predicting the future, so Tiresias, Eteocles, and Manto go to the grove of Diana to perform necromancy. Manto and Tiresias have a vision of the underworld and its many inhabitants come to drink the offered blood. They also see the spirit of Laius at a distance, who only approaches after Tiresias convinces him that his hate is for his son Oedipus, not his grandson Eteocles; the spirit of the old king tells them that Thebes will be victorious, but victory shall belong to Oedipus. As the Argives march through Nemea, Bacchus causes a drought for the army. The army encounters Hypsipyle who is nursing the child Opheltes (Archemorus). She leaves the boy and shows the Argives a spring where they finally find water; the book ends with praise for Nemea. Book 5 Asked by the Argives who she is, Hypsipyle tells her story. To punish the island of Lemnos for ignoring her worship, Venus drives the women of the island to kill all the men. Hypsipyle saves her father, Thoas, setting him adrift at sea in a chest. Just as the Lemnian women despair of their future, the Argonauts arrive, sleep with the women, and soon leave. When Hypsipyle's rescue of her father is revealed, she flees Lemnos and becomes a nurse to Opheltes. As Hypsipyle talks, a snake crushes Opheltes, which is killed by the Argives. King Lycurgus and Eurydice mourn their son, and the Argives suggest the institution of the Nemean games to commemorate Opheltes. Book 6 The Argives burn Opheltes on a massive pyre, and funeral sacrifices are performed while Eurydice recites a lament. Nine days later, contestants gather for the new Nemean Games which include chariot racing, which Amphiaraus wins, foot races, at which Parthenopaeus is cheated of an easy victory, and a discus contest, which Hippomedon wins. Capaneus is almost killed in the boxing, and Tydeus wins in the wrestling. The book ends with Adrastus's ill-omened attempt at archery. Book 7 Jupiter, angry at the Nemean delay, sends Mercury to the Thracian temple of Mars to stir the army. Mars sends Panic into the Argive army to frighten the soldiers who resume their march. Bacchus pleads to Jupiter to avert the war in vain as the Argives arrive at Thebes with terrible omens. Antigone and an old servant look at the army from a tower and describe the heroes (teichoscopia), and Jocasta tries to dissuade Polyneices from fighting. The Argives kill two tigers sacred to Bacchus and stir the Thebans to battle. The poet invokes the muse as he begins to describe the first skirmish where Apollo gives Amphiaraus an aristeia. During battle, the earth opens and swallows Amphiaraus and his chariot. Book 8 As Amphiaraus descends, Pluto, threatened by this violation of his realm, sends Tisiphone to create crimes in the war. The Thebans celebrate after the battle while Melampus propitiates Tellus with sacrifices in the Argive camp. The poet invokes Calliope when the battle is joined again. Both sides make gains in the fighting, but Atys, Ismene's betrothed, is killed and brought to Oedipus. Tydeus is wounded by Melanippus. Tydeus then slays him and eats his head. Thebes, Campanian red-figure Neck-amphora attributed to the Caivano Painter, ca. 340 BC, J. Paul Getty Museum (92.AE.86).J. Paul Getty Museum 92.AE.86. Book 9 Tydeus dies and the armies struggle for the body. Tisiphone drives Hippomedon to enter the fray and recover the body and the hero has an aristeia. There is a battle in the river Ismenus and Hippomedon is killed when the river floods to avenge its grandson at the behest the boy's mother, Ismenis. The heroes fight for the body of Hippomedon and Hypseus dies. Atalanta in Arcadia has a dream of Parthenopaeus' death and prays to Diana who gives him an aristeia before he is killed by Dryas. Book 10 The Thebans celebrate as the wives of the heroes in Argos perform sacrifices to Juno. Juno sends Iris to the grove of Sleep who puts the Theban army into a deep sleep during the night. A band of soldiers is gathered by the Argives which enters the Theban camp and slaughters the sleeping warriors. The pair Dymas and Hopleus kill many Thebans and are slain together. The Thebans awake and flee into the city; there is battle at the gates, which are eventually closed. Tiresias demands the death of Menoeceus for the war to end. Menoeceus leaps from the walls. Capaneus climbs a tower and curses Jupiter who kills him with a thunderbolt. Book 11 The Argives are driven by the Thebans to their camp. Tisiphone and Megaera stir Polyneices to challenge Eteocles to single combat to decide the war. Jocasta and Antigone try to dissuade them, but they go out into the plain to fight. Fortuna and Pietas try to delay the fight but are driven away by the furies. The brothers kill each other, and Oedipus laments as Jocasta kills herself at the news. Creon assumes power, forbids the burial of Polyneices and the Argive dead, and exiles Oedipus while the Argives quietly return home. Book 12 The Thebans bury their dead. The Argive widows travel to Thebes to bury their dead relatives but receive the news that Creon has denied them burial; the women travel to Athens to ask Theseus to help them. Argia secretly comes to Thebes and meets Antigone outside the wall; they burn the bodies of the brothers on one pyre, but the flames separate. Creon arrests the women as the widows become suppliants at the altar of Clementia at Athens. Theseus prepares an army against Thebes and slays Creon in battle. The Thebaid ends with an epilogue in which the poet prays that his poem will be successful, cautions it not to rival the Aeneid, and hopes that his fame will outlive him. Ancient reception and canonicity The Thebaid was popular in Statius's lifetime and (according to the epic‚Äôs final verse), Roman schoolboys were already memorizing passages from the epic before it was finished.Bailey, p. 3. Statius was personally favored by Emperor Domitian, and the educational use of his poem might be seen as a consequence of official favor;Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 11th ed. s.v. Statius. however, the poem remained a popular piece of Latin literature for many centuries, a testimony to its literary merit and lasting appeal. A commentary on the Thebaid is transmitted under the name of Lactantius Placidus, dating from the 5th or 6th century AD, which has proven useful to modern scholars.Kaster, Robert, in The Oxford Classical Dictionary (Oxford, 1996), p. 811. Influence Chaucer's \\"Knight's Tale\\". In the late 12th century a French verse romance, Le roman de Th√®bes, was composed by an unknown author, probably at the court of Henry II of England. Here the Thebaid is transformed into a chivalric epic. Giovanni Boccaccio, the 14th-century Italian poet and author best known for his Decameron, also borrowed heavily from the Thebaid when composing his Teseida (which, in turn, was used heavily by Chaucer when composing \\"The Knight's Tale\\" for the Canterbury Tales). Of particular importance is a scene in which Mercury is sent to the realm of Mars. All three of these works (as well as Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene) contain large tracts of allegorical figures that are housed in War's realm and which represent the various futilities of war and violence. Finally, one of the chief reasons that Statius is remembered today is because of the poet Dante Alighieri. Like Virgil, who is a character in the first two canticles of Dante's Divine Comedy, Statius, too, plays a large role in the Comedy: Dante and Virgil meet Statius in Purgatory, and he accompanies the two to the Earthly Paradise at the summit of the holy mountain. Through the medium of Dante, Statius gets to meet his precursor, Virgil, and praise him personally. This scene is justified as the historical Statius devoted the closing lines of his Thebaid to praise of Virgil. Critical responses to the Thebaid Despite its popularity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the Thebaid's reputation suffered in 19th- and early 20th-century scholarship. Scholars of that era considered Statius \\"derivative\\" and unoriginal and criticized his seemingly positive view of Domitian's regime. In the late 20th century, scholars have attempted to rehabilitate Statius; a series of new translations have been accompanied by a slew of studies (see bibliography) which seek to bring Statius back into the classical canon. =The Thebaid and its context= Criticism of Statius has been forced to deal with the poet's flattering attitude to the repressive emperor Domitian in his Silvae and his seeming vindication of the regime in the Thebaid.Coleman in Bailey, pp. 10‚Äì13. Scholars of the early 20th century dismissed Statius as a mere panegyrist for a tyrant. More recent scholars have taken the opposite view of Statius and interpreted the Thebaid as a criticism of civil war and the Flavian dynasty's rise to power. The cruelty and madness of the characters have been interpreted as symbolic of the cruel behavior of Domitian and his officials. The prominence of suicide in the Thebaid has also been linked with the concept of suicide as social protest found in Tacitus. Scholars like P. HardieHardie, P. The Epic Successors of Virgil: A Study in the Dynamics of a Tradition (Cambridge, 1993). have pointed out a drastic imbalance in the poem which privileges violence over peace and have noted the focus on disrupted succession. Scholars have also looked at Statius's funeral games and their connection to the poetic competitions Statius participated in.Thuillier, J. \\"Stace, Thebaide 6: les jeux funebres et les realities sportives\\" (Nikephoros 9, 1996). =Style= The style of the Thebaid has been described as episodic by scholars;Coleman in Bailey, pp. 13‚Äì18. in the past this was considered a major flaw but has since been reevaluated. Scholars have noticed a strong degree of control over the arrangement of episodes, description, and teleological narrative and point out the way that the poem's juxtapositions emphasize certain structural devices in the text. The development of intertextual readings has similarly shown that Statius's imitation of Vergil and other poets is often highly astute and creative. The importance of rhetoric, another point of criticism from earlier scholars, has also been studied in the Thebaid; it is often through speeches that Statius develops his character rather than through narrative description and Statius's has been shown to be a masterful handler of rhetorical technique. =Divine machinery= Like the majority of epics that precede him (with the notable exception of Lucan's Bellum civile), Statius makes full use of the gods as plot devices; however, Statius employs them in his own creative way.Coleman in Bailey, pp. 17‚Äì18. Denis Feeney has pointed out that the role and effectiveness of the Olympian gods is drastically reduced in comparison with chthonic deities. Jupiter's power in particular is usurped by the gods of the underworld, personifications and allegories, and human heroes (like Theseus).Feeney, D., The Gods in Epic (Oxford, 1991). In Statius' depiction of the gods, C. S. Lewis sees Statius' technique as a departure from Homer's and Vergil's more mythological treatment; Statius' development of allegory was an important step towards allegory's domination in Medieval literature. To illustrate the difference, Lewis contrasts Homer's Ares, who does other things besides rage in war, with Statius's Mars, a personification of an abstraction, who even before the battle begins is always already raging in his blind and insane passion.Lewis, C. S., The Allegory of Love (1936), pp. 48‚Äì56. Lewis further claims that on account of this difference, in the Thebaid \\"lies the germ of all the allegorical poetry\\".Lewis, p. 54.

The transmitter is off Farm-to-Market Road near Fort Bend Parkway in Southwest Houston.Radio-Locator.com/KKHH KKHH broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD-2 subchannel carries Channel Q, an Entercom LGBTQ talk and EDM service. The HD-3 subchannel simulcasts the sports radio programming heard on AM 650 KIKK. Station history =Beginnings as \\"Cool\\"= KKHH signed on the air as \\"Cool\\" KHUL at 7 a.m., October 4, 1959. KHUL carried a mostly instrumental easy listening and jazz format and billed itself as \\"Cool, Refreshing Radio\\". KHUL was the first stand-alone FM station in the Houston radio market to operate with a 24-hour schedule. KHUL was powered at 15,500 watts, a fraction of its current output. It was owned by Charles Temple, president, and Ken Norman, vice president, which operated the station as Nor-Temp Broadcasting.Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-151 =Country era= In 1966, the station was bought by Leroy J. Gloger, who owned Pasadena daytime only AM country music station KIKK. Gloger requested the station's call letters be changed to KIKK-FM and began to simulcast the AM's country format as \\"KIKK 96 FM\\" (KIKK pronounced as \\"kick\\"). After album rock station KILT-FM flipped to country in 1981, the station saw fierce competition throughout the 1980s and early 1990s from the KILT combo. More competition came when KKBQ switched from easy country to a top 40 country approach in 1992. KIKK became KILT's sister station in late 1993,Greg Hassell, \\"KIKK corraled by KILT's owner Westinghouse\\", The Houston Chronicle, July 9, 1993.Louis B. Parks, \\"KILT-KIKK merger results in mass firings\\", The Houston Chronicle, October 27, 1993. and KIKK struggled trying different variations on the format, including going from mainstream country to a more current-heavy approach in September 1994,http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-09-09.pdf then going head to head with KKBQ as \\"Young Country 95.7\\" by early 1997, and eventually rebranding as just \\"95.7 KIKK-FM\\" by September 2000.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-09-01.pdf =95.7 The Wave= At Noon on November 4, 2002, KIKK-FM flipped from its long running country format to Smooth Jazz as \\"95.7 The Wave\\", with the KHJZ call letters being adopted on November 7.Clifford Pugh, \\"KIKK now in a jazz format\\", The Houston Chronicle, November 5, 2002.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2002/RR-2002-11-08.pdf =Hot 95.7= On March 12, 2008, at 5:37 p.m., KHJZ began stunting with a loop of \\"Don't Stop\\" by Freestyler and \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" by Rihanna, while promoting an announcement to come at 3 p.m. the next day. At that time, the station flipped to Top 40/CHR, branded as \\"Hot 95.7.\\"David Barron, \\"KHJZ switches formats\\", The Houston Chronicle, March 14, 2008.From Radio-Online (March 13, 2008) \\"KHJZ Houston to Flip to CHR\\", From Radio Insight (March 12, 2008) The first song on \\"Hot\\" was \\"Hot In Herre\\" by Nelly. The format used an interactive approach and positioned its Rhythmic hit-flavored direction in between KBXX and KRBE. At first, because of its choice of direction, Mediabase had placed KHJZ on its Rhythmic reporter panel, but moved it over to the Top 40/CHR panel as its playlist started playing non- Rhythmic fare.From Mediabase The KKHH call letters were adopted on April 1, 2008. In an interview from the online website All Access (on the day of the flip), GM Laura Morris said, \\"We've built HOT 95-7 for the listener. We don't pick the hits; They do. Every hour, listeners can vote for the top hit of that hour and we'll play a song at the top of the next hour. We'll do that 24 hours a day... it's the first and only station we know of making listeners feel like they have that kind of control.\\" KKHH OM/PD Jeff Garrison, who also programmed Country sister KILT-FM and Sports Talk KILT (AM), added, \\"Houston's always been about making history ... from the oil wildcatters and the 8th Wonder of the World to landing on the moon. HOT 95-7 is Houston's next generation of radio, blazing a big, bold hot radio station for Houston listeners. HOT 95-7 has multi-cultural pop appeal with a rhythmic spice to match Houston's diversity. We're about today's new music, celebrity artists, pop culture, lifestyle and trends ... whatever is HOT now. We're online, on demand and in touch with the pulse of the next generation of pre-teen radio listeners.\\" On Friday, June 27, 2008, CBS announced the addition of Brad Booker and Sarah Pepper as the new morning show hosts of HOT 95-7 with a start date of July 21, 2008. \\"We're very excited to have Booker & Sarah join the Hot team,\\" said Hot/Houston PD Mark Adams. \\"I feel they're two of the most passionate, fun and entertaining morning show personalities out there, and I'm confident they'll do a great job here in Houston.\\" On February 22, 2010, PK and Ivan (from the syndicated The Playhouse morning show in Portland, Oregon) joined HOT 95-7 as the new morning show hosts, with Sarah Pepper remaining. Her former co-host, Brad Booker, moved over to sister station KHMX to join Maria Todd; Booker would later be released in 2011 following Todd's move to afternoons and Kidd Kraddick taking over the morning slot. PK would be released from the station in January 2016, with Pepper and Ivan remaining as morning show hosts. \\"Brit 95.7\\" stunt On Thursday, March 26, 2009, the station started running format change promos by the Station Manager. Dave Morales put the Station Manager on-air (unknown to him) to ask why...and what was going on. The station manager just passed the buck and blamed CBS management and could not provide further information. When he found out he was on-air, he slammed down the phone. The \\"changeover\\" was supposed to take place at 6:00am on Monday, March 30, 2009. There were rumors that said it would be an Urban station, similar to KBXX (97.9 The Box) and the defunct KPTY (Party 93.3); this was because there was an ad for Los Angeles sister station \\"AMP 97.1\\" listed on the bottom of the page. But many calls to the management or e-mails to the management were bilingual, hinting that they were pursuing a Latino format. However, The Pussycat Dolls were scheduled to appear in studio on Monday, the day \\"the switch\\" would be taking place. The entire \\"change\\" for March 30, 2009 was apparently a marketing ploy. The station \\"changed\\" to BRIT 95.7 to coincide with Britney Spears/Pussycat Dolls concert at the Toyota Center the same evening. The station played nothing but Britney Spears music, and some Pussycat Dolls music all day. The station would revert to HOT 95-7 at Midnight. =95.7 The Spot= At 10:20 a.m. on December 30, 2016, after playing \\"Don't Wanna Know\\" by Maroon 5, KKHH began stunting with a robotic voice counting down from 2,957 to 0; at the same time, a message appeared on Hot's website, saying \\"We're making some changes to 95-7. Tune in at 12:30 PM to find out what.\\" At that time, KKHH flipped to adult hits as \\"95.7 The Spot\\". The first song on \\"The Spot\\" was \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" by Prince. The flip returned the format to the market for the first time since May 2009, when KHJK flipped to adult album alternative. CBS Launches Variety Hits \\"95.7 The Spot\\" HoustonKKHH Becomes 95.7 The Spot Much of the \\"Hot\\" airstaff was let go as a result of the format change, while Hot morning show co-host Sarah Pepper was retained and became part of a new morning show on sister station KHMX. The following Thursday, struggling classic hip-hop station KROI changed its format to CHR, presumably in response to KKHH's format change. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. HD radio KKHH (as KHJZ) signed on HD Radio operations in 2006. 95.7-HD2 carried a traditional jazz format. After the flip of the analog/HD1 signal in March 2008, the smooth jazz format that was on the former moved to KKHH-HD2, as well as \\"The Wave\\" moniker. When CBS bought KHMX (96.5 FM) in April 2009, KKHH-HD2 and KHMX-HD2 swapped formats, with KKHH-HD2 now airing a dance format, branded as \\"Energy 95.7\\", while the smooth jazz format and \\"The Wave\\" moniker moved to KHMX-HD2. In addition, KKHH added an HD3 channel in 2010. KKHH-HD3 carries a simulcast of sports talk station KIKK.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=7 HD Radio Guide for Houston-Galveston After two years of broadcasting the Dance format on 95.7 HD2, \\"Energy 95-7 HD2\\" began offering On-Demand streaming via the Radio.com app/platform and Energy957.com in the Summer of 2012, joining WBBM- HD2/Chicago, KMVQ-HD2/San Francisco, and WPGC-HD2/Washington, D.C. as the latest CBS Radio outlets to offer Dance formats through the Radio.com platform. Playing a variety of EDM genres such as Progressive, Electronica, Trance, and Dance-pop, the station also airs a variety of 1990's tracks as well as limited commercial interruptions.

Broadcasting at 600 kHz with 5,000 watts of power and a directional pattern that drives the signal from northeast to southwest, the station boasts that it can be heard clearly in six states and two Canadian provinces. KSJB can be heard with a clear \\"city-grade\\" signal in cities such as Valley City, Bismarck, Fargo, Grand Forks, Minot, Pierre, South Dakota, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and Bemidji, Minnesota. Both KSJB and KSJZ broadcast from studios at the Buffalo Mall. They share a transmitter site south of Jamestown, on Highway 281. Programming When they signed on in 1937, they featured local programs and news, with Standard Middle of the Road Music formatting. Beginning in 1963, KSJB programmed a \\"Top 40\\" format, competing directly with Bismarck's KFYR/550 located 100 miles to the west, which also featured a popular music format. In the 1960s the station became heavily involved with various promotions, including publishing and distributing a weekly Top 40 handout and sponsoring numerous concerts. Several of those concerts featured Count Basie's Orchestra, who station owner at that time Ed Crilly often played with on various cruise ships in the early 1970s. After extensive research, in 1973 the decision was made to change the format to country-western, and the change was made over the Easter weekend, without fanfare, or prior notice to the listeners or the announcing staff. Given the station's extensive reach, it continued to focus on music and programming for truck drivers and farmers, with a schedule heavy with farm market reports and agribusiness information. Currently KSJB broadcasts Classic Country music, local news, hundreds of local and regional Class A and Class B football and basketball games, and specialty programming on weekends. History KSJB first signed on the air March 14, 1937. It operated under the name of KRMC with a power of 250 watts at 1370 kHz. The call letters KRMC came from the company name at the time: Roberts, MacNab Co. (Arthur L. Roberts, R.B. MacNab and A.J. Breitbach, general manager.) The studios were at the Gladstone Hotel downtown, and the transmitter and tower was on the south edge of Jamestown. A few years later, the station moved to their current spot on the dial at 600 kHz, but the power was still 250 watts daytime and 100 watts at night. Later the station was purchased by John W. Boler, who changed the call letters to KSJB in 1943. Finally in 1947, KSJB began its operation as a 5,000 watt directional station, with the transmitter and triple towers located along highway 281 about 6 miles south of Jamestown. Both are still located there, and in the fall of 2014, all three towers and original infrastructure was replaced at a cost of $900,000. The company's FM station, KSJZ \\"MIX 93.3\\" (originally KSJM), an adult contemporary radio station, went on the air in 1967. In 1948, KSJB \\"established auxiliary studios and control facilities in Fargo.\\" Studios and offices were added in Aberdeen, South Dakota in the 1960s as well, but none of those exist today.

In principle, afrancesados were upper-and-middle class supporters of the French occupation of Iberia (Portugal and Spain), preferring the reforms of the \\"enlightened despots\\" Napoleon I and his brother Joseph Bonaparte (installed by Napoleon as king of Spain) or, as a lesser evil, preferring to avoid the consequences of outright war with the greatest military power in Europe.Joes, Anthony James. Guerrilla Conflict Before the Cold War, pp. 109-110. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996. Google Books. Retrieved 28 January 2019. Spain =Origins= In Spain, the term afrancesado surfaced during the reign of Charles III, and had a neutral meaning, being used to designate those who followed French fashions and customs. Subsequently, it became popular as a pejorative reference to those members of the Spanish nobility and bureaucracy who swore allegiance to Joseph I Bonaparte, installed as king of Spain by his brother, Napoleon The term extended to cover a predominantly middle-class intellectual, merchant or manufacturer who saw the French as agents of change in the rigid structure of Spanish society, and who reacted against the perceived corruption and incompetence of Charles IV and the House of Bourbon in general (including Joseph's competitor Ferdinand VII). =Political program= Appointed king by his brother Napoleon Bonaparte, Joseph found himself at war with the majority of his subjects. He relied on the afrancesados to enforce a project that would gradually replace tradition and absolutism with a system Leandro Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n defined as based on raz√≥n, la justicia y el poder (\\"reason, justice, and power\\"). Progressive but not entirely liberal, this political creation was soon rejected by both conservatives and liberals (many liberals joined the guerilla against the occupation). The afrancesados were also weary of French designs: more favorable to the Revolution than of the Empire, they aimed to withdraw Spain from the Napoleonic Wars, and tried in vain to prevent Napoleon's separate administration of Spanish provinces (Catalonia, Aragon, Navarre, and Biscay) after 1809. The Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata had a French viceroy at the time, Santiago de Liniers. However, his appointment took place before the Peninsular War, and France was not involved at all in it: it was instead a consequence of the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, a conflict between Britain and the Spanish colonies. Napoleon and Joseph sent the Marquis of Sassenay to the zone, seeking support from Liniers to the new monarchy, but Liniers rejected it and confirmed his loyalty to the captive king Ferdinand VII. Later, they also attempted to negotiate with the anti- French Cortes of C√°dizwhich served as a parliamentary Regency after Ferdinand VII was deposedto maintain as much possible of Joseph's Bayonne laws of 1808 into Ferdinand's 1812 Constitution. Nonetheless, the Cortes voted to confiscate all assets of Joseph's court and of the afrancesados. =Exile= Plaque commemorating Francisco Goya's exile to Bordeaux After Wellington's 1813 campaign and the battle of Vitoria, all of Joseph's court and his collaborators (nobles, soldiers, jurists, writers, journalists, and Roman Catholic clergy alike) took refuge to France with Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's armies. The total estimate of this exile is fluctuating between 4,000 and 12,000 persons at its peak. Ferdinand broke the terms of his agreement with Napoleon after his return detention at the Ch√¢teau of Valen√ßay (May 4, 1814), and began a campaign of persecution, defining as afrancesados most of those who had not risen in combat against the French: colaboracionistas (servants of French interests), receivers of honours and distinctions handed by king Joseph, co-operating bureaucrats (those who had not resigned their positions during the occupation), or even those who were sought by the French as collaborators but had denied offers. The immense number of liberally-minded √©migr√©s alarmed the authorities of the Bourbon Restoration in France, and they began steps to convince the Spanish government to pardon them. This came during the Liberal Triennium, as an amnesty decreed by liberal Premier Evaristo P√©rez de Castro; those that did return had to flee soon after the Quintuple Alliance intervention. On April 21, 1832, France ordered them to solve their highly problematic stateless condition by either settling in the country or leaving its territory, Joseph Bonaparte's great-great-grandson Frederick Joseph Benton born 1954 reviewed the afrancesado doctrine in 1999 but has done nothing to advance its cause. =Notable Spanish afrancesados= *Francisco Amor√≥s *Miguel Jos√© de Azanza, Duke of Santa Fe *Fernando Sor *Javier de Burgos *Fran√ßois Cabarrus (was considered an afrancesado in retrospect) *Fernando Camborda *Jos√© Antonio Conde *Guido Bellico *Leandro Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n *Jos√© Mamerto G√≥mez Hermosilla *Francisco Goya *Alberto Lista y Arag√≥n *Juan Antonio Llorente *Jos√© Marchena *Francisco Mart√≠nez Marina *Juan Mel√©ndez Vald√©s *Sebasti√°n Mi√±ano *Manuel Narganes *Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Navarrete *Gonzalo O'Farrill *Manuel Jos√© Quintana *F√©lix Jos√© Reinoso *Mariano Luis de Urquijo *Diego Fern√°ndez de Velasco, 13th Duke of Fr√≠as *Juan Van Halen *Francisco Antonio Zea Portugal The term afrancesado in Portugal is connected with liberal politicians who organized the Revolution of Porto, begun on August 25, 1820.

The book details the history of the personal computer, closely tying the ideologies of the collaboration-driven, World War II-era defense research community to the embryonic cooperatives and psychedelics use of the American counterculture of the 1960s. The book follows the history chronologically, beginning with Vannevar Bush's description of his inspirational memex machine in his 1945 article \\"As We May Think\\". Markoff describes many of the people and organizations who helped develop the ideology and technology of the computer as we know it today, including Doug Engelbart, Xerox PARC, Apple Computer and Microsoft Windows. Markoff argues for a direct connection between the counterculture of the late 1950s and 1960s (using examples such as Kepler's Books in Menlo Park, California) and the development of the computer industry. The book also discusses the early split between the idea of commercial and free-supply computing.

KHTK broadcasts a sports radio format as \\"KHTK Sports 1140\\" and is an affiliate of the CBS Sports Radio network. It is owned by Bonneville International, a profit-making subsidiary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The studios and offices are on Commerce Circle in North Sacramento, just north of the American River.PublicFiles.fcc.gov/KHTK KHTK is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for commercial AM radio stations. But because AM 1140 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A XEMR Monterrey, Mexico, and WRVA Richmond, Virginia, KHTK must broadcast with a directional antenna at all times to avoid interference, using a five-tower array. The transmitter is on Rising Road in Wilton, California.Radio- Locator.com/KHTK KHTK is the second Sacramento AM station, after 1470 KIID, to broadcast using the HD Radio hybrid format. The signal is audible as far north as Redding, as far south as Monterey and into the suburbs of San Francisco. It is also simulcast on an HD subchannel of sister station 105.1 KNCI- HD3.https://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=1 HD Radio Guide for Sacramento Programming Lineup Weekdays begin with \\"The Drive with Carmichael Dave\\" in morning drive time. In middays, two CBS Sports Radio nationally syndicated shows are heard: Los Angeles-based \\"The Jim Rome Show\\" followed by \\"Tiki & Tierney\\" with Tiki Barber and Brandon Tierney. KHTK has a local afternoon drive show featuring former Kings player Doug Christie along with Jason Ross. At night and weekends, when there is no live game scheduled, KHTK carries CBS Sports Radio shows. KHTK serves as flagship station for Sacramento Kings NBA basketball (whose team colors are the same as the station‚Äôs logos) and UC Davis Aggies football. Also heard are Oakland Athletics baseball, Las Vegas Raiders football and San Jose Sharks hockey. History =Early Years= KHTK first signed on the air on November 12, 1926.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 pg. C-25 It carried the call sign KGDM. The station was originally owned by Hercules Broadcasting, licensed to Stockton, California, and operating at 1130 kHz with 1,000 watts of power. Initially it was a daytimer, required to go off the air from sunset to sunrise. The 1941 North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement required the station to move its frequency. KGDM switched to 1140 kHz with 5,000 watts, now authorized to broadcast full-time. By 1962, the station had changed its city of license to Sacramento, and moved to new facilities with 50,000 watts of power. =Country KRAK= KGDM flipped to a country music format, and adopted the call letters KRAK. Some of the early personalities included \\"Oakie Paul\\" Westmoreland, Walt Shaw, and Dick Bains. With country music moving more into mainstream popularity during the 1970s, KRAK became one of the Sacramento area's most popular stations. Listeners were not only exposed to artists such as Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, and Willie Nelson, but enjoyed two decades of on-air personality stability. Joey Mitchell worked the 6:00 - 10:00AM \\"Drive Time\\" and was named \\"Sacramento Radio Personality of the Year\\" several times. Rick Stewart could be heard middays between 10:00 - 2:00PM. Big Jim Hall covered the 2:00 - 6:00PM \\"Afternoon Drive.\\" Hal Murray worked evenings. Fred Hoffman hosted \\"Captain Fred's All-Night Truckin' Show. All had Top 40 backgrounds which led to a tighter, more upbeat format. KRAK continued to broadcast into the 1990s, long after other music stations had switched to the FM band. KRAK-FM would eventually move ahead in the ratings, later becoming 105.1 KNCI through changes after a purchase by CBS Radio and frequency switching. =Talk and Sports= On February 28, 1994, KRAK became KHTK, a Hot Talk station, as \\"Hot Talk 1140.\\" The call letters were chosen to reflect the Hot TalK format.Source: Sacramento Radio History in the 1990s from PlaylistResearch.com After a couple of years in the talk format, it flipped to its current all-sports format.\\"Doing the country shuffle; KRAK, KNCI, New Country are likely to get new names\\", The Sacramento Bee, January 15, 1994. The call letters \\"KRAK\\" would make a brief return in the Sacramento media market as a country oldies station at AM 1470 before that station was sold to Radio Disney and is today KIID airing programming in Punjabi. Most recently, the KRAK call letters were assigned to the now-KMPS in Victor Valley, California, also owned by CBS and airing the CBS Sports Radio Network.http://tangentsunset.com/sacramentoradio.htm KHTK was originally branded as \\"Sports 1140\\" before adopting \\"The Fan\\" branding in November 2011. On January 1, 2013, KHTK began to identify itself as \\"CBS Sports 1140.\\" On July 1, 2013, 6 months after identifying as \\"CBS Sports 1140,\\" KHTK switched its branding back to \\"KHTK Sports 1140\\", then to \\"Sports 1140 KHTK\\". One of KHTK's initial sports hosts was Pro Football Hall of Famer Jack Youngblood, who co-hosted with Mike Remy, the station's former program director. =Changes in Ownership= On July 31, 2008, the CBS Corporation announced that KHTK and its five sister stations in Sacramento were being put up for sale as part of the planned divestiture of radio stations outside the top-15 U.S. radio markets. But it remained part of the CBS Radio family for nearly a decade. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom which locally owned KKDO, KUDL, KSEG, KRXQ, and KIFM. The company formerly owned 107.9 KDND until it shut the station down and turned in its license to the Federal Communications Commission two days later. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom On October 10, CBS Radio announced that as part of the process of obtaining regulatory approval of the merger, KHTK would be one of sixteen stations that would be divested by Entercom, along with sister stations KYMX, KZZO, and KNCI. 102.5 KSFM would be retained by Entercom. On November 1, Entercom announced that Bonneville International would begin operating KHTK, KYMX, KZZO and KNCI via a local marketing agreement (LMA) when the merger of CBS and Entercom closed on November 17, while their licenses were placed into a divestiture trust pending a sale to a different owner within 180 days. Entercom LMAs Sacramento & San Francisco Stations to Bonneville On August 3, 2018, Bonneville announced it would buy the stations outright in a $141 million deal. The sale was completed on September 21, 2018. =Controversy= Former KHTK afternoon host and Kings play-by-play announcer Grant Napear was a staple of the station's programming from 1997 until 2020. But in June 2020, Bonneville fired Napear for insensitive remarks towards former Kings player DeMarcus Cousins in a series of Twitter feeds regarding the Black Lives Matter movement.\\"KHTK Sacramento Fires Grant Napear After Anti-BLM Tweet\\" from Radio Insight (June 2, 2020) References External links * Category:1926 establishments in California Category:Bonneville International Category:CBS Sports Radio stations Category:Las Vegas Raiders broadcasters Category:Radio stations established in 1926 HTK Category:Oakland Athletics broadcasters Category:Sacramento Kings broadcasters Category:Sacramento Monarchs broadcasters Category:San Jose Sharks broadcasters Category:Sports in Sacramento, California Category:Sports radio stations in the United States Category:UC Davis Aggies football ","title":"KHTK"},{"id":"4881752","text":"The Hemp Industries Association (HIA) is a non-profit trade group representing hemp companies, researchers and supporters in the United States and Canada. The group petitions for fair and equal treatment of industrial hemp. Since 1994, the HIA has been dedicated to education, industry development, and the accelerated expansion of hemp world market supply and demand. History HIA was established in 1994 by 45 U.S. hemp industry companies. Cannabis activist and author Chris Conrad served as its first president. By 1998 the association had more than 200 members. In 2010, the organization bought the diaries of Lyster Dewey and plans to display them to the public for the first time in many years at the first Hemp History Week. HIA said in 2014 that hemp seed oil is less than 25 parts per million CBD, thus hemp oil is not a source of CBD Which could be used in epilepsy treatments. HIA vs. DEA On October 9, 2001, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) posted an interpretive rule on its website declaring that all hempseed products containing any traces of THC would be considered seizable contraband, effectively criminalizing all hempseed products in the US. After a period of public comment, the DEA filed the final proposed rule in the federal register on March 21, 2003. One week later, the HIA joined with the Organic Consumers Association and several companies which used hempseed in one or more products to file suit against the DEA rule going into effect. On February 6, 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously for the HIA, opining that the DEA did not have the authority under the federal Controlled Substances Act to ban an otherwise legal product because it might have traces of THC. On September 28, 2004, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the appeal, allowing the Ninth Circuit decision to stand. The settlement between HIA and DEA was finally reached on May 25, 2018, in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Its studios are located in the Greenway Plaza district of Houston, and its transmitter is located in Pasadena. While it only broadcasts during daytime hours at 250 watts, KIKK's low dial position gives the station a large coverage area, stretching from Flatonia, Texas to the west, and past Lake Charles, Louisiana to the east. History KIKK commenced operations as radio station KRCT in 1947, licensed to Baytown. The Bay Broadcasting Company was the original owner, having built and operated the station since its inception. Bay Broadcasting would sell KRCT to Industrial Broadcasting Company in 1958, not long after moving it from the original tower site in Baytown, to its current home in Pasadena. On May 1, 1961, KRCT changed call letters to the current KIKK. KIKK only operates from local sunrise to local sunset in order to protect clear-channel WSM in Nashville. For a time in the 1960s, Industrial attempted to operate the station earlier than sunrise in Houston and Nashville and begin operations at 6:00 am each day. This was denied at district court and appeals court, and the station's prior operation at such times was sanctioned with a $10,000 fine from the Federal Communications Commission. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, 650 was the country music station in Houston. It simulcasted with its FM sister station at times (the former KIKK-FM, now KKHH), and was part of a heated country war with KILT AM- FM until 1994. By this point, KILT-AM dropped the country format programming it has been utilizing since 1981, becoming Houston's first sports station, while KIKK was merely filling time by simulcasting its FM sister full-time. 650 AM finally broke the simulcast with 95.7, and flipped to business news as \\"Business Radio 650\\" in 1996. Former CNN 650 logo used 2005-2010KIKK changed formats in July 2004 to Hot Talk under the moniker KIKK Ass 650, which became the Houston home for The Howard Stern Show.Clifford Pugh, \\"Houston mornings get a shock; Stern's show gives KIKK listeners a rude awakening\\", The Houston Chronicle, July 1, 2004.

Their early evening schedule was composed of Adult Standards music until 2008, when Headline News completely took over the rest of the schedule, but that network's continuous move away from rolling news to focus more on personality talk caused the station to seek other programming such as the Clark Howard Show, which then took up most of the station's schedule. In 2010, the station flipped to a local personality-emphasizing talk format (branded simply as \\"Talk 650\\"); however, it switched to an all-syndicated lineup in July 2011.\\"Talk 650 KIKK announces new programming lineup\\", mikemcguff.com, July 1, 2011 KIKK dropped its talk format on January 2, 2013, and became a sports radio station affiliated with CBS Sports Radio.

Moorad is an American businessman and investor. He began his career as a sports agent, before serving as General Partner and CEO of MLB's Arizona Diamondbacks, and Vice-Chairman and CEO of MLB's San Diego Padres. Player representation Moorad began specializing in athlete representation in 1983. He concentrated on Major League Baseball and signed a number of athletes, including Will Clark and four other members of the United States national baseball team in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 1985 he partnered with Leigh Steinberg, and the two would go on to work together for eighteen years and negotiate more than $3 billion in athlete contracts. Their firm, 'Steinberg & Moorad,' represented such athletes as Steve Young, Troy Aikman, Warren Moon, Manny Ramirez, CC Sabathia, Vernon Wells, Edgerrin James, Ed Reed, Pat Burrell, Darin Erstad, Adam Dunn, Luis Gonzalez, Orlando Hernandez, Thurman Thomas, Eric Karros, Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez, Mo Vaughn, Shawn Green, and Raul Mondesi, among many others.http://a.espncdn.com/mlb/news/2002/0223/1339433.html 'Steinberg & Moorad' was sold in October 1999 to the Assante Corporation, a Canadian asset management firm, for a reported $120 million. Moorad was named to The Sporting News‚Äô annual 100 Most Powerful People in Sports on eight occasions. Major League Baseball =Arizona Diamondbacks= In 2004, Moorad became an owner and CEO of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He owned close to 12% of the team, estimated to be worth around $18 million in 2009. While with Arizona, Moorad was a General Partner, Chief Executive Officer, the spokesman for the Diamondbacks‚Äô ownership group, and oversaw the day-to-day operations of the franchise. =San Diego Padres= In 2009, Moorad put together a group to buy the San Diego Padres from John Moores. Moorad and his group of 12 investors (including former client Troy Aikman, billionaire Chairman/CEO of Save Mart Supermarkets Bob Piccinini, and then-CEO of Panda Express Tom Davin) began purchase of the team with Moorad serving as club CEO and Vice-Chairman. The sale was valued at about $500 million, and the group planned to purchase the team over five years. During this time, Moorad's group also purchased the Padres' minor league Triple-A team, the Portland Beavers. In 2010, Moorad was named one of San Diego's Most Admired CEOs by the San Diego Business Journal. In April 2012, Moorad negotiated a new TV deal that would lead to the creation of Fox Sports San Diego, and bring in over $1.2 billion for the Padres over the next 20 years. By 2011, Moorad had sold his 12% share of the Diamondbacks. By January 2012, Moorad and his group held 49% ownership of the Padres, when MLB deferred voting on approval for the group to complete the sale with Moores. In March 2012, Moorad withdrew the group's application to complete the full purchase of the Padres. He stepped down as CEO of the Padres later that month, but remained with the team as Vice-Chairman. Some media outlets speculated that Moorad was short of the needed support of 22 MLB team owners to complete the purchase of the Padres, though only two were suspected of opposing completion of the purchase. Moores declared that the entire team was up for sale again in April, citing the good opportunity in the market after the record $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers; Moorad's minority group would receive 49% of the proceeds of any sale of the Padres. Moorad was succeeded by Ron Fowler as lead of the group of any owners transferring ownership to the new purchase. In August, the Padres were sold for $800 million, a $300 million increase over the valuation in Moorad's 2009 purchase.

It serves students in class 11 and class 12. It was founded in 1950 by the Sisters of the Holy Cross.  History  It was the time, after the partition of the Indian Subcontinent, in 1947, the Archbishop of Dhaka, Lawrence L. Garner, CSC, requested this establishment of a Girls' College by the Sisters of the Holy Cross. This task was asked of Augustine Marie. On 1 November 1950, Holy Cross College officially began its journey in Dhaka, the Capital of the then East Pakistan. Rose Bernard, (who had just arrived that year) was also called upon to help Augustine Marie in this endeavour. Augustine Marie, the founder and first principal, is remembered as a woman of great vision, humanity and passion. She wanted each student of Holy Cross College to become a mature and responsible woman... one who could contribute to society with her own knowledge, moral values, and achievements. The initial motto of the college, as indicated in our earliest Scribe, was: ‚ÄúGentle in manner Strongly in deed.‚Äù The college started with 5 students and now it has about 2500 students. Presently, the faculty consists of 47 teachers. At its opening, it began with the Humanities Group. Later on, the Science Group was added and very recently, in 2005, the Business Studies Group was opened. A six-storied building with an auditorium was built within the last ten years. During these 60 years there were five principals: Augustine Marie, Joseph Mary, Mrs. Gerty Abbas, Marian Teresa and the present one, Shikha Gomes. There were three acting principals: M. Rose Bernard, Joseph Mary and Joann Havelka.

At a time when few people owned FM radios, this was a rare \\"stand-alone\\" FM outlet, not co-owned with an AM radio station, TV station or newspaper. The station was purchased in 1963 by Monroe Lopez, owner of several Mexican restaurants in the Austin area. Under Lopez' ownership, KAZZ adopted a block-programming format featuring various types of music throughout the broadcast day. They included easy listening, jazz, country music, show tunes, R&B;, and, starting in 1964, Top 40. That made KAZZ (now known as \\"Kay-Zee\\" or \\"Alive 95\\" on the air) the first FM station in Austin to play rock and roll. During this time, the station also expanded its broadcast day from 6am-1am to 24 hours. =KOKE-FM= In November 1967, Lopez sold KAZZ to the owners of AM 1370 KOKE (now KJCE).

KOKE 1370 became KMMM, a Regional Mexican music station, while KOKE-FM switched to soft adult contemporary music as KLQT. The call sign stood for \\"Light 95,\\" as in light music. In the mid-1980s, the station got a boost to 100,000 watts, the maximum power permitted for non- grandfathered FM stations. (The current power has been reduced to 49,000 watts, but the tower height is now 1,306 feet (309 meters) in height above average terrain (HAAT), making KKMJ's signal equal to Austin's other major FM stations, heard from the suburbs of San Antonio to Temple and Killeen.)

Her best known works were: Four Girls at Chautauqua, Chautauqua Girls at Home, Tip Lewis and his Lamp, Three People, Links in Rebecca's Life, Julia Reid, Ruth Erskine's Crosses, The King's Daughter, The Browning Boys, From Different Standpoints, Mrs. Harry Harper's Awakening, The Measure, and Spun from Fact. She also wrote the primary lesson department of the Westminister Teacher, edited the Presbyterian Primary Quarterly and the children's magazine Pansy, and wrote a serial story for the Herald and Presbyter of Cincinnati every winter. Alden was interested in Sunday school primary teaching, and had charge of more than a hundred children every Sunday for many years. She was interested in temperance also, but health issues and a busy life kept her from taking an active part in the work. She gave liberally to the cause, and four of her books, Three People, The King's Daughter, One Commonplace Day, and Little Fishers and their Nets, were distinctively temperance books, while the principle of total abstinence was maintained in all her writings. Early life and education Isabella Macdonald was born in Rochester, New York to well-educated parents, Isaac and Myra Spafford Macdonald. Her father was a temperance man with pronounced convictions upon subjects regarding social reform, as well as an abolitionist, believing slavery to be a sin. Her mother was devoted to everything that was \\"pure and of good report.\\" The sixth of seven children, she was initially home-schooled by her father, who also gave her the nickname Pansy, because of an incident that occurred in her childhood. Her mother had taken great pride in a bed of pansy blossoms. Macdonald, seeing the flowers, and thinking there was no one more deserving of them than her mother, pulled them and threw them into her mother's lap exclaiming, \\"I pulled every one for you.\\" She could not understand her mother's look of distress. The father, seeing the disappointed look on the little girl's face, picked her up, seated her on his shoulder and said, \\"Never mind, baby, you shall always be my little pansy-blossom.\\" She developed her writing skills early: as a child, she kept a daily journal which her father critiqued. The letters she wrote to absent family members formed a habit of expressing her thoughts which proved to be useful in her career. When she was ten years old she wrote the story of the clock entitle Our Old Clock. The father said the story must be printed in order to preserve it, and that she might sign her pet name \\"Pansy\\" to it. The child was delighted to see something of her own writing in print. She was educated at Seneca Collegiate Institute, Ovid, New York, and Young Ladles' Institute, Auburn, New York. Marriage She met Reverend Gustavus Rossenberg Alden while teaching at Oneida Seminary in New York. His work took the couple to various parts of the country, including Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. After their marriage in 1866, Alden divided her time among writing, participating in church activities, teaching at several of the Chautauqua sessions, and raising her son, Raymond Macdonald Alden, who was born in 1873. By 1900, the family had three residences: a home in Philadelphia; a summer residence in Chautauqua, New York; and a winter home in Winter Park, Florida. Literary works The Pansy (June 1894) Alden's first book, Helen Lester, was written for a contest at age twenty. She wrote approximately 75 Sunday school books, and a number of volumes of fiction for older readers, as well as The Prince of Peace, a life of Christ. She wrote on the subjects of love to God and love to her fellow-men, dedicating her work to the advancement of the Christian religion in the home life and in the business life. She served as president of the Missionary Society, superintendent of the primary department of the Sunday School, identified with the Chautauqua assemblies, and prepared the Sunday School lessons for the \\"Westminster Teacher\\". Her works were translated into Swedish, French, Japanese, and Armenian. Alden edited the Juvenile periodical Pansy, 1873‚Äì96. For many years, she was a contributor to Herald and Presbyter, Cincinnati, and Christian Endeavor World, Boston, besides the Primary Quarterly. She made her home in Palo Alto, California. Throughout her life, Alden combined her writing and her religion. She did much work with Christian periodicals, writing serialized stories for the Herald and Presbyter from about 1870 until 1900; editing The Pansy, a Sunday juvenile, from 1874 to 1896; editing the Primary Quarterly and producing the primary-grade Sunday School lessons for the Westminster Teacher for 20 years; and working on the editorial staff of Trained Motherhood and The Christian Endeavor World. From 1865 to 1929, Alden authored about 100 books. Most of her works are didactic fiction with religious principles, which concentrate on translating Biblical precepts into acceptable Christian behavior in a modern world. Several of her books, such as her most popular work Ester Ried, were based on personal experiences; others, such as the Chautauqua Girls series, were motivated by her interest in the Chautauqua movement. She and her niece, Grace Livingston Hill, even make a brief appearance in the final chapter of the series' last book, Four Mothers at Chatauqua. Alden's books were enormously popular during the late 19th century. In 1900, sales were estimated at around 100,000 copies annually. Some titles like Ester Ried, were translated into several languages, including French, German, Russian, and Japanese. Personal life Alden was a constant sufferer from headache, which never left her and was often very severe, but she refused to call herself an \\"invalid\\". Her physician limited her to three hours of literary work each day. After the deaths of her husband and son in 1924, Alden moved to Palo Alto, California to live with her daughter-in-law.

Early life Apostolo Zeno was born in Venice to a colonial branch of the Zeno family, an ancient Venetian patrician family. His family had been transplanted from Venice to the Kingdom of Candia in the 13th century in order to maintain Venetian order and suppress any rebellious subjects. Following the assault on the island by the Ottoman Empire, the remaining members of his family returned to Venice. Upon return they were not readmitted to the patrician class, but were only able to obtain status as ordinary citizens. His father was Pietro Zeno, a doctor of medicine, and his mother, Caterina Sevasto, belonged to an illustrious and powerful family from Candia, Crete. Having lost his father at an early age, he was left to the care of his mother, who remarried to Venetian senator Pier Antonio Cornaro. His education was entrusted to the Somaschi Fathers. He was in 1691 among the founders of the Accademia degli Animosi. In 1695, he composed his first libretto, Gli inganni felici, which obtained great success, making him a fashionable librettist. From 1705, he worked with Pietro Pariati, keeping the theatrical scenes for himself and leaving to Pariati the composition of the libretti.  Works  Drammi scelti He began work as a literary journalist for the Galleria di Minerva, also taking upon executive responsibilities, but distanced himself when he realized that he had not succeeded in making the impact upon the publication that he intended. In the end he described it as an idiocy. In 1710 together with Scipione Maffei, Antonio Vallisneri and his brother, Pier Caterino Zeno, he founded the Giornale de' letterati d'Italia, maintaining that it was necessary that \\"Italians themselves make their own newspaper... revealing that good sense, erudition and ingenuity never were lacking among us, and now more than ever are they flourishing.\\" The tri-monthly publication had prestigious contributors such as Scipione Maffei, Antonio Vallisneri, Eustachio Manfredi, Ludovico Antonio Muratori, Giovanni Battista Morgagni, Giovan Battista Vico, Bernardino Ramazzini. Motivated above all by the desire to improve Italian learning, it enjoyed considerable success. When Apostolo Zeno was called to duty as poet laureate to the imperial court of Vienna in 1718, his brother, Pier Caterino took over the direction until 1732, publishing the periodical annually. Apostolo remained in Vienna until 1729, at which point he was replaced by Pietro Metastasio. He returned to Venice, dedicating himself to works of erudition and to coin-collecting. Zeno wrote the libretti for 36 operas with historical and mythological themes, including Gli inganni felici (1695), Odoardo (1695) Faramondo (1698), Lucio Vero, Imperatore di Roma (1700), Griselda (1701), Temistocle (1701), Merope (1711, Edition, 1727), L'Ambleto (1712), Alessandro Severo (1716), T'Euzzone (1719), Ormisda (1721), Artaserse (1724), Semiramide (1725), Domenico Sarro's Il Valdemaro (1726), Astarto (1730), Caio Fabbricio (1733), Euristeo (published 1757), and Sesostri re d'Egitto (Prague edition 1760) as well as 17 oratorios, including Giuseppe (1722), Gioaz (1726), David umiliato (1731). Among his literary works, the Dissertazioni vossiane are additions and corrections to De historicis latinis by Voss. His Annotazioni to the Biblioteca della eloquenza italiana by Giusto Fontanini were published posthumously. His correspondence (Epistolario) is ample.  Critical evaluation  From condemnation of the unrealistic and exaggerated elements of melodrama was born a demand for greater verisimilitude in plots and for literary dignity in texts. Zeno was the first to undertake reform to make melodrama more sober, according to the arcadici principles, developed further by Metastasio. Inspired by French tragedians, he respected, as they did, the rule of the unity of time and space. He reduced the number of characters and scenes and eliminated the clown roles, constructing his works so that they could be presented also without music. Francesco de Sanctis, referring to Metastasio, wrote that \\"if we look at the structure, his drama is constructed in the fashion which Apostolo Zeno already demonstrated. But the structure is only a simple skeleton. Metastasio breathed into that skeleton the grace and the romance of a happy and harmonious life. He was the poet of melodrama; Zeno was the architect.\\" References Category:1669 births Category:1750 deaths Category:Italian poets Category:Italian male poets Category:Italian opera librettists Apostolo Category:People from Venice Category:Italian male dramatists and playwrights ","title":"Apostolo Zeno"},{"id":"4881898","text":"Babylon A.D. is a 2008 science fiction action film based on the 1999 novel Babylon Babies by Maurice Georges Dantec. The film was directed by Mathieu Kassovitz and stars Vin Diesel, M√©lanie Thierry, Michelle Yeoh, Lambert Wilson, Mark Strong, J√©r√¥me Le Banner, Charlotte Rampling, and G√©rard Depardieu. It was released on 29 August 2008 in the United States. It is an international co-production between France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Plot In a dystopianBabylon A.D. Review. empireonline.com (August 2, 2008). Retrieved on September 7, 2020. 2027, Russian mobster Gorsky (Depardieu) hires the mercenary Toorop (Diesel) to bring a young woman known only as Aurora (Thierry) from Europe to New York City. Gorsky gives Toorop a variety of weapons and a subdermally implanted UN passport. Toorop, the girl, and her guardian Sister Rebeka (Yeoh), travel from the Noelite Convent in Kyrgyzstan to reach New York via Russia. Unlike in the technologically advanced U.S., war and terrorist activity have transformed Russia's cities into dangerous, overpopulated slums. The stress of humanity's situation causes Aurora to act out in strange ways and display clairvoyance abilities. On one such occasion, Aurora, seemingly for no reason, panics and runs from a crowded train station, just before it explodes in a terrorist attack. The protagonists must also evade an unknown group of mercenaries claiming to have been sent by Aurora's supposedly dead father. Later, they board a submarine that carries refugees to Canada. To avoid satellite detection, the submarine abandons and shoots some refugees. Aurora, infuriated by the loss of life, operates the 30-year-old submarine without training. Sister Rebeka tells Toorop that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two, and always seems to know things she has never learned. Three months before leaving with Toorop, she began acting differently. This occurred after a Noelite doctor administered a pill. The doctor told her to go to New York City and arranged for Toorop to escort them. After arriving in Alaska with help from Toorop's associate Finn (Strong), the protagonists are attacked by weaponized drones. Toorop manages to destroy all the drones, but also gets wounded. These perils cause Finn to betray the group, so Toorop shoots him dead. Once in Harlem, a news broadcast about the bombing of the Kyrgyzstan convent causes the group to realize there is more going on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess (Charlotte Rampling) only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again in a hotel room. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin. Looking outside the hotel, Toorop sees Gorsky's men and the Noelite group, heavily armed and waiting for them on the street. The High Priestess calls Toorop and asks him to bring Aurora outside. Just before they take her away, Toorop changes his mind and starts a firefight with the two groups to get two women to safety. Gorsky's men can fire guided missiles onto Toorop that track his subdermal passport. Rebeka gets killed defending Aurora, who in turn shoots Toorop, saying, \\"I need you to live.\\" Toorop's clinical death causes the guided missile to go off target (missing Toorop) and explode near Aurora instead; she inexplicably survives. Dr. Arthur Darquandier (Lambert Wilson) revives Toorop using advanced medical techniques, but several of Toorop's body parts are replaced with cybernetics to undo the damage of being dead for over two hours. Darquandier explains that when Aurora was a fetus, he implanted a supercomputer into her brain. It is also implied that the Noelite group had him create Aurora to become pregnant at a certain time to use her as a \\"virgin birth\\". After she was born, the Noelites hired Gorsky to kill Darquandier, but he failed. Darquandier remained \\"dead\\" until he found his daughter in Russia with Toorop. Darquandier uses a machine to scan Toorop's memory to find out what Aurora said to him before and shortly after shooting him. In Toorop's memory, Aurora tells Toorop to \\"go home\\". Toorop and several of Darquandier's men leave the facility. En route to Darquandier's lab, the High Priestess calls Gorsky, and during their videocall Gorsky is killed by a nuclear missile launched at him by the High Priestess. The High Priestess confronts and kills Darquandier, but Toorop has already escaped. Toorop goes to his old house in the forest, finds Aurora, and takes her to a hospital, where, 6 months later, she dies after giving birth. Aurora was \\"designed to breed\\", not to live, so her death after childbirth was preprogrammed. Toorop takes care of her two children. In a scene that is only present in the theatrical cut but was removed from the director's cut, the twins are shown to be of different ethnicities, one looking like Aurora and the other like Toorop. Cast * Vin Diesel as Hugo Toorop, a mercenary and a former Marine (full name is \\"Hugo Cornelius Toorop\\" in Babylon Babies novel).

Production Preparing for the filming in Ostrava- Poruba, Czech Republic =Development= Mathieu Kassovitz worked on an English-language film adaptation of Maurice Georges Dantec's French novel Babylon Babies for five years; in June 2005, this project got financing from StudioCanal and Twentieth Century Fox. The adapted screenplay was written by Kassovitz and screenwriter √âric Besnard. Production was initially slated to begin in February 2006 in Canada and Eastern Europe. =Casting= French actor Vincent Cassel was initially sought to be cast in the lead role. In February 2006, actor Vin Diesel entered negotiations to star in the film, titled Babylon A.D., dropping out of the lead role of Hitman in the process. =Filming= The shooting schedule was slated to begin in June 2006. By February 2007, filming was slated to wrap in April to release Babylon A.D. in time for the coming Thanksgiving. In February, filming took place at Barrandov Studios. In March 2007, the filming crew, having shot in the Czech Republic, took a two-week hiatus to deal with uncooperative weather, such as the lack of snow, and problems with set construction. Crew members scouted Iceland for locations with snow to shoot six to eight days of footage, which was supposed to be done in February. Filming was also done with the leads Diesel, Michelle Yeoh, and M√©lanie Thierry in Ostrava in March. The French visual effects company BUF Compagnie was contracted to develop the film's effects under the supervision of Stephane Ceretti. In April 2007, Babylon A.D. was reported to be over-budget and three weeks behind schedule. A lack of snow meant a skiing sequence to be shot in Eastern Europe had to be moved to Sweden. Later in the month, actor Lambert Wilson was cast into the film. Filming was completed in May 2007. American artist Khem Caigan designed the sigil that appears as a tattoo on the right side of Toorop's neck ‚Äì an emblem which originally appeared in the Schlangekraft Necronomicon in 1977. Mathieu Kassovitz said that 20th Century Fox interfered throughout production, and he never had a chance to shoot a scene the way it was scripted, or the way he wanted it to be. A French language documentary of the troubled creation of the film entitled Fucking Kassovitz was released in 2011. =Music= The music of Babylon A.D. was written by Icelandic composer Atli √ñrvarsson. The music supervisor of the movie was J√©r√¥me Hadey. The musical alliance Achozen, represented by Shavo Odadjian and RZA performed the score for the film. Music producer Hans Zimmer described the intended style: \\"Musically, our objective was to merge the sounds and energies of hip hop with classical music, seamlessly melting them into an unusual soundscape.\\" Release Babylon A.D. was originally stated to be released in the United States on 29 February 2008, but its release was postponed to 29 August 2008. As of 31 January 2009, the film had grossed $72,105,690 worldwide. In the US the film was placed #2 behind Tropic Thunder with $9,484,267 in 3,390 cinemas with a $2,798 average. Reception On Metacritic it has a score of 26% based on 15 reviews, indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\". On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 6% approval rating based on 104 reviews (96 negative, 6 positive) with the consensus calling it \\"a poorly constructed, derivative sci-fi stinker with a weak script and poor action sequences.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade D+ on scale of A to F. Jordan Mintzer of Variety called it \\"A noisier, costlier version of \\"Children of Men,\\" yet lacking that film's social-political significance and jaw-dropping direction.\\" Home media Babylon A.D. was released on Blu-ray and DVD in Europe (Region 2) on 29 December 2008, and in the United States (Region 1) on 6 January 2009. At the same time, the French 101 minute version was released on Blu-ray in the US as Babylon A.D. ‚Äì Raw and Uncut.

It comes from the word for head, ra æs. The corresponding word for leadership or chieftaincy is ri æƒÅsa. It is often translated as \\"president\\" in Arabic, and as \\"boss\\" in Persian. Swahili speakers may also use it for president. The Ottoman Turkish form of the title is reis, which denoted a captain (a term with identical etymology, being from Latin caput, head). The term ra æƒ´s is of pre- Islamic origin. It may function as an honorific laqab in a person's name. In the central Arab world, the term originally meant village headman. British India In British India the landed gentry in Muslim societies often used the word rais to describe their aristocratic position held in society. The term rais was also often used by Muslims when making deed of endowments in their community. Although, the word meant 'chief' or 'leader' legal documents used it in the context of 'landlords' or landowners. Other terms such as malik or Zamindar also appeared as 'landlords' or ‚Äòlandowners‚Äô, even though these titles implied that the individual who bore them was more ruler than proprietor.Muslim Endowments and Society in British India, By: Gregory C. Kozlowski. pp 47-48. Cambridge University Press, 1985. However, when describing any aspect of the management of their holdings 'rais or zamindars' employed regal terminology. The rais sat upon a throne (masand or gaddi). Riayat, whom British preferred to call tenants or cultivators were literally subjects. When a rais met with his riayat he described himself as holding court (darbar). The money which riayat paid his lord was tribute (nazrana) not rent. The place where he paid the tribute was called a kachari, just as a government revenue office was, and the clerks who collected, kept accounts and ensured tributes kept coming on time were known by their Mughal courtly styles of (dewans) and (sipahis ‚Äì a horse trooper). Urdu From Arabic, via Persian, this word came into Urdu as raees, which means a person belonging to the aristocracy of noble distinction.Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India, By: Henry Yule, A. C. Burnell - pg 438. Oxford University Press, 2013. In Urdu, the word Rais is also used similarly to the English term \\"old money,\\" as the opposite or antonym of nouveau riche, a person who has accummulated considerable wealth within his or her generation. When the book \\"The Pleasure of Philosophy\\" by Will Durant was translated into Urdu, by Syed Abid Ali Abid, he translated the word aristocracy with the Urdu word raisiyyat (). Palestine The adjective azam (great), is also added to mean 'the great rais'. This term, as well as the term (Chairman), are used by Israeli media to refer to the President of the Palestinian National Authority, as opposed to (President).

KLTH's studios and offices are located on SW 68th Parkway in Tigard, Oregon.1067theeagle.iheart.com/contact The transmitter is located on SW Barnes Road in the Tualatin Mountains. KLTH covers much of Northwestern Oregon and Southwestern Washington. History =KQIV= The station signed on for the first time at 10:15 P.M. PDT on September 15, 1972 as KQIV.Broadcasting Yearbook 1973 page B-164 It was a short-lived but popular progressive rock station. KQIV was owned and operated by Willamette Broadcasting Company, Inc., with Walter J. M. Kraus serving as president. The station also called itself \\"KQ4\\" and \\"FM 107.\\" The original KQIV offices and studios were located at the Lake Oswego Elks Lodge (#2263). Members of this historically conservative organization frequently crossed paths with the station's hippie disc jockeys and creative staff. The KQIV transmitter was located between Oregon City and Carver. An American Electronic Laboratories (AEL) FM-25KD transmitter fed 24,000 watts into a Jampro JSCP eight element antenna yielding an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. The antenna was mounted on a 200-foot tower based at an elevation of 800 feet in height above average terrain (HAAT). Both the \\"Q\\" and \\"IV\\" in the station's call sign alluded to four-channel quadraphonic sound. KQIV was reported in the local press to be the second quadraphonic radio station in the world. and the first to be designed and built to be quadraphonic, But those reports were based on erroneous information. KQIV established its quadraphonic identity and \\"Rockin' in Quad\\" branding in anticipation of being selected as the exclusive FM station in the Portland radio market to field test the Dorren Quadraplex System, invented by audio engineer Louis Dorren. About a month before KQIV went on the air, the FCC suspended further testing of Quadraplex due to a concern that the system used a subcarrier component not permitted under its regulations. KQIV continued to identify itself as a quadraphonic station in the hope that Quadraplex testing eventually would be permitted. Meanwhile, the station broadcast music from phonograph records encoded in various quadraphonic matrix formats. In 1974, operation of KQIV was turned over to Brotherhood Broadcasting Company, with Roy Jay as president. Brotherhood changed the station's music format to urban contemporary, branded as Soul 107. In 1975, the KQIV offices and studios were moved to Milwaukie. But the station's ratings failed to improve. Ongoing financial difficulties led to the court-ordered liquidation of KQIV, which went off the air on June 18, 1976. =KMJK= KQIV remained silent for nearly 14 months. On August 1, 1977, Communico Northwest Corp. began operating the station, using the same license as KQIV. The call sign switched to KMJK, using the moniker \\"Magic 107\\" and playing soft rock. The offices and studios moved to \\"Magic Manor\\" in Lake Oswego and the transmitter was relocated to Portland. On June 29, 1979, KMJK changed its format to Top 40, but still called \\"Magic 107.\\" The contemporary hit format failed to catch on, and in July 1981, KMJK changed back to Soft Adult Contemporary music, still using the \\"Magic 107\\" moniker. In August 1982, KMJK switched back to Top 40, while retaining the \\"Magic 107\\" name. On April 13, 1987, at 6 a.m., after a 12-hour stunt, KMJK changed its format to classic hits, now calling itself \\"Classic Hits 106.7.\\" On September 1, 1989, KMJK shifted its format to classic rock, calling itself \\"Classic Rock 106.7.\\" On February 19, 1990, KMJK changed to hot adult contemporary as \\"106.7 Magic FM.\\" =KMXI, KKBK and KKJZ= On January 25, 1991, the station rebranded and changed call letters to \\"Mix 106\\" KMXI, while continuing its Hot AC format. On December 30, 1991, KMXI changed its format to oldies as \\"Oldies 106.7.\\" In 1993, KMXI was bought by BayCom Partners for $2.6 million.Broadcasting Yearbook 1994 page B-B-304 On July 7, 1993, 106.7 flipped to classical music as \\"K-Bach\\" KKBK. While the format was popular with mostly older listeners, the station struggled to attract advertisers. In less than a year, management decided to try a different unique format that was catching on in many cities, Smooth Jazz. On March 17, 1994, the station became KKJZ, and rebranded as \\"Smooth Jazz 106.7.\\" =KLTH= In 1998, KKJZ was acquired by Infinity Broadcasting, which later was merged into CBS Radio.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook page D-364 On February 1, 2002, CBS changed the station's call sign to KLTH, and flipped back to Soft AC as \\"Lite Rock 106.7, K-Lite.\\" On January 9, 2006, KLTH changed its format to 1960s and 1970s oldies as \\"106.7 K-Hits.\\" Over time, KLTH expanded its scope to cover the 1980s as well. Its competition was Adult hits KYCH, which was previously KKSN, Portland's outlet for the oldies format prior to KLTH's debut. The debut of ‚ÄúK-Hits‚Äù was quite successful, capitalizing on the oldies/classic hits vacuum left by KKSN. Programmed by Dennis Constantine and Creative Imaging by John Hugill, K-Hits was a top 3 contender until KQOL changed to classic hits and competed directly. On April 1, 2009, CBS Radio sold KLTH to Clear Channel Communications along with KXJM. The sale made KLTH and KQOL sister stations. Both co-existed until May 6, 2009, when KQOL flipped to classic rock as KFBW. Previous KQOL were redirected to KLTH, which aired the message \\"Welcome 105.9 listeners.\\" Weekend specialty programs on KLTH included \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", a weekly classic Disco show. Shortly after the move, on August 17, 2009, the name was changed to \\"Oldies 106.7\\" with a logo identical to CBS Radio's WODS in Boston. This was later replaced by a more modern logo. In the May 2011 Arbitron PPMs, KLTH became the number one station in the Portland area radio rankings, overtaking the market's usual top station, co-owned KKCW, which plays adult contemporary music.Portland Arbitrons from Radio-Info On August 1, 2014, at 5 p.m., KLTH shifted its format to classic hits and rebranded as \\"106.7 The Eagle\\". Most listeners did not notice much of a change, since KLTH had already been cutting back 1960s titles and focusing mostly on the 70s and 80s hits. KLTH-HD2 In 2010, KLTH began broadcasting in the HD Radio format. On June 4, 2010, KLTH-HD2 signed on a 1950s-1960s oldies format branded as \\"Real Oldies\\". On April 17, 2015 KLTH-HD2 switched to iHeartMedia's \\"My 60s\\" format, featuring the hits of the 1960s (now known as \\"iHeart '60s\\"). KLTH-HD3 In December 2018 KLTH began airing \\"The Breeze\\" soft adult contemporary format on its HD3 subchannel.

History 97.9 FM was originally owned by the McClatchy family. It was originally the FM sister station to KMJ, with the callsign KMJ-FM. Known as \\"Music 98\\", the station broadcast classical music, then pop standards. In 1981 the callsign was changed to KNAX and the format was changed to country. KNAX's competition at that time was KMAK, an AM station that had adopted the Country format around 1966. By 1985, KMAK had changed format to News/Talk, and KNAX was the sole Country outlet for the Fresno area. This lasted until 1992 when 93.7 changed format to Country as \\"Kiss Country\\". Both stations co-existed until KNAX was sold to Henry Broadcasting, which also owned KSKS. The format of KNAX was altered to a mix of classic Country with a few currents at this time. The station adopted the nickname of \\"Kickin' Country 98\\", and the original KNAX logo was replaced. In July 1996, KNAX and KRBT were sold from Osborn Communications to American Radio Systems, which would then sell to Infinity Broadcasting (now CBS Radio) in 1998. On July 3, 1998, with the emergence of a new format called \\"Jammin' Oldies\\" consisting of Classic R&B;/Soul and Disco, the owners decided to take KNAX in a different direction and dropped country in favor of this current format and call letters KMGV, \\"Mega 97.9\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-07-10.pdf Peak Broadcasting acquired KMGV, and several other Fresno market stations, in November 2006 from CBS Radio.

It was published by Accolade, and is the fourth in a series of video games named after golfer Jack Nicklaus, following Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition (1992). The original Microsoft Windows version was developed by Cinematronics. Versions were also released for Macintosh and DVD. The game was followed by Jack Nicklaus 5, released later in 1997. Gameplay Jack Nicklaus 4 includes eight different game modes. The game features five 18-hole courses, including four real-life courses: Muirfield Village, Colleton River Plantation, Country Club of the South and Cabo del Sol. The fifth course is Winding Springs, a fictional location created by the developers using a golf course designer program that comes with the game. The course designer allows the player to create a custom golf course, one hole at a time. The course designer includes over 100 scalable objects, including bushes, trees, and rocks. Approximately two-thirds of the game's instruction manual is devoted to the course designer, which also includes a built-in wizard program to aid the user. The game includes the ability to import and convert online user-created golf courses from Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition, which also featured a course designer. Courses created in Jack Nicklaus 4 are compatible with the game's sequel, Jack Nicklaus 5. The player competes against various opponents throughout the game, including Jack Nicklaus, who is not a playable character. The game includes four multiplayer modes, via serial cable, modem, LAN, or the Internet. While aiming, the player can get an overhead view that goes up to 150 feet high. The DVD version includes 10 game modes and an ABC Sports video titled Toughest 18 Holes. The DVD version also features four golf courses, as well as six others that were made with the course designer. In addition, the game offers three types of weather and five types of wind. Development and release Jack Nicklaus 4 was developed by Cinematronics, with Michael Franco as producer. The team's goal was to develop a game which would recreate the experience of playing real golf, partially through graphics and sounds. The game would also offer more viewing angles than other golf games, and more control over the swing profile. During development, the game included the subtitle Golden Bear Edition. Development was underway as of January 1995, and the game was announced that month at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show. The game was developed for Microsoft Windows due to the operating system's increased prevalence. Franco produced the game on behalf of Accolade, while Brad Fregger produced it for Cinematronics; they both also handled the game design. Fregger joined the development team in 1996, when Cinematronics contacted him to help finish the game. Dennis Clark programmed the physics, while Mike Sandige programmed the rendering. Jim Mischel programmed the course designer. The game includes 16.7 million colors. The game does not support 3D cards, as it already uses a fast rendering engine. Another factor was scheduling and the competitive market, prompting Accolade to release the game without 3D card support. The game has 32 megabytes' worth of sound, which include regionally authentic bird sounds for the golf courses. The game uses DirectSound, and its multiplayer mode utilizes DirectPlay. The course designer was modeled after Nicklaus Productions' computer-aided design system. Accolade began shipping the Microsoft Windows version on March 25, 1997. In May 1997, Accolade announced that it would release the game on Macintosh later in the summer. A free upgrade with several new features was released online in June 1997. That month, Accolade announced it would release the game on DVD in the summer, to take advantage of the format's increasing popularity. A PlayStation version, titled Jack Nicklaus '98 and featuring the same courses as Jack Nicklaus 4, had been scheduled for release in late 1997, although it was never released. The Macintosh version was published by MacSoft. An online game, Jack Nicklaus Online Golf Tour, was released in 1998. It was based on the Jack Nicklaus 4 game engine, and online courses created with Jack Nicklaus 4 were playable through Jack Nicklaus Online Golf Tour. Reception Jack Nicklaus 4 received positive reviews, but sold poorly. The game was praised for its graphics, its multitude of online courses, and its course designer, although some reviewers were critical of the inability to create custom objects with the designer. Some praised the golf ball animations for their realism when hitting different terrains. Scott A. May of Computer Gaming World called it \\"the preeminent golf simulation of our time\\" and an \\"absolute model of perfection\\" with nearly \\"everything you could ever hope for\\" in a golfing video game. Anthony Baize of AllGame praised the game for its realism, options, and sound effects, but criticized the golfers for looking noticeably different against the game's backgrounds. T. Liam McDonald of GameSpot called it \\"a fine piece of work with only a couple minor flaws,\\" which included a lack of certain ideas that McDonald hoped to see in a future Jack Nicklaus game. Computer Gaming World and GameSpot noted that self-made golf courses could take up to 10 megabytes of space, considered high at the time. Computer Gaming World further noted that the game took approximately 171 megabytes of hard drive space to download, and wrote, \\"As if anticipating consumer resistance, Accolade makes absolutely no mention of this fact on the box or in the manual.\\" The Edmonton Journal also mentioned the high installation requirements and noted that such requirements were not specified on the game's box. PC Zone criticized the game for difficult aiming and putting. The Palm Beach Post praised the course designer but considered it difficult to use. The newspaper praised the game's swing meter as \\"greatly improved\\" over previous games. Macworlds Michael Gowan wrote about the Macintosh version, \\"Featuring five courses, network play, a convincing physics model, and the ability to create your own courses from scratch, this golf simulation has only one bogey: the delay between swinging the club and the corresponding animation.\\" Dean Renninger of MacAddict stated that while some of the game's graphical details were good, they were \\"a far cry from photorealistic.\\" Renninger considered the game too easy, and believed that the Links series was superior. AllGame's Jonathan Sutyak reviewed the DVD version and criticized it for not taking advantage of the DVD format. In addition, Sutyak criticized the graphics and sound for not being improved over the computer version, and criticized the in-game instructions for being erroneous. He praised the gameplay and called the game \\"very good,\\" but \\"not enough of an improvement\\" over the computer version, stating that people who owned the original version would have no reason to buy the DVD version.

Members of the IIT specialised in the study and practice of indirect taxes. The body was formed in July 1991 and formally launched in October 1991. It gained permission to call itself an institute in December of the same year. It operated as a company limited by guarantee. Entry to the Institute was normally gained by taking up to four professional examinations in indirect taxation. There were two routes through the exams, the Value Added Tax route and the customs route, which reflect two of the most major areas that indirect taxation is applied to in the United Kingdom. It was possible to gain exemptions from some of the exams through possessing other suitable qualifications which include those from various British accountancy professional bodies, the Chartered Institute of Taxation and HM Revenue and Customs. The four papers were: * I: Legal, Business and Professional Ethics * II: optional paper which is dependent on whether the VAT or customs route through the qualification is being taken * III: Other Indirect Taxes * IV: Stamp Taxes, Direct Taxes and Interaction of all Taxes Those who have passed the examinations and been accepted into membership were entitled to use the designatory letters AIIT (Associate of the Institute of Indirect Taxation). Upon submission of a thesis to the institute it was possible to become a Fellow of the Institute of Indirect Taxation which allowed for the use of the designatory letters FIIT. Other categories of member, which were without designatory letters, were student members and affiliate members. It was also possible to be made an honorary member or Fellow.

Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts a soft adult contemporary format. KSWD's studios are located on Fifth Avenue in Downtown Seattle; the station broadcasts from two transmitters located near Issaquah on Tiger Mountain, with its main transmitter operating at 73 kW effective radiated power, and its auxiliary transmitter operating at an ERP of 53 kW. KSWD broadcasts in HD Radio, carrying a blues format on its HD2 subchannel branded as The Delta. History =Early years= The station's legacy on FM radio dates back to July 8, 1961, when it signed on as KOL-FM, a simulcast of its AM sister station KOL (1300 AM). From 1962 to 1967, KOL-FM was owned by television producers and game show moguls Mark Goodson and Bill Todman;\\"Changing Hands\\", Broadcasting, 29 October 1962, p. 62. during this period, KOL-AM-FM aired top 40 and middle of the road formats.Warren Guykema, \\"KOL is Swinging Station With Some Serious Aims\\", The Seattle Times, 17 November 1963, TV Section, p. 4.Marty Loken, \\"Like It or Loop It, KJR's Still No. 1\\", The Seattle Times, 12 April 1964, p. 19Schneider, op. cit., p. 108.Marty Loken, \\"KOL's New Sound- Rock and Roll from the Mudflats\\", The Seattle Times, 13 June 1965, TV Section, p. 17 The pair of stations was sold to Buckley Broadcasting in 1967. The station had a progressive rock format from 1968 to 1975, competing with KISW and, starting in 1974, KZOK-FM. In 1975, the station changed its call letters to KEUT and its format to beautiful music. =KMPS-FM= The station changed to its long-running country format as KMPS-FM on February 1, 1978, continuing to simulcast its AM sister. Throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, KMPS-FM was the dominant (and sometimes only) country station in the Seattle area. EZ Communications bought KMPS-AM-FM from Hercules Broadcasting in 1986. EZ sold the AM station to Salem Communications ten years later in 1996. In July 1997, EZ merged with American Radio Systems. Westinghouse/CBS bought American Radio Systems' stations (including KMPS) on September 19, 1997. In June 1998, CBS split off the radio division under the revived Infinity Broadcasting name, which would be renamed CBS Radio in December 2005. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. KMPS would be retained by the new company, making it a sister station to country competitor KKWF as well as KHTP, KISW, and KNDD. To meet ownership limits set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), sister stations KFNQ, KJAQ, and KZOK-FM were divested to iHeartMedia. The merger was approved on November 9 and was consummated on November 17. On the same day as the completion of the merger, KMPS-FM switched to all-Christmas music, leading to speculation that the station was planning to change formats after the holiday season. On-air personality Deanna Lee denied that this was the case, and stated that KMPS would remain a country station. However, the rumors would turn out to be true. =KSWD= On December 4, 2017, at 9:12 a.m., KMPS-FM flipped to soft adult contemporary as \\"94.1 The Sound\\", launching with \\"Hello\\" by Lionel Richie. These changes briefly made KKWF the only country station in Seattle, before KVRQ abruptly flipped to the format later in the morning. The station's call letters were changed to KSWD on December 11, 2017; these calls were previously used by KKLQ, an Entercom station divested during the merger which had also branded itself as \\"The Sound\\". The KMPS calls were moved to sister station KRAK in Hesperia, California. On January 16, 2018, John Fisher, former longtime morning host at KMTT, was announced as KSWD's morning host beginning January 22. Ten days later on January 26, it was announced that Seattle resident and nationally syndicated personality Delilah would become the station's midday host beginning January 29. Alongside her daytime program on weekdays, KSWD airs her syndicated program on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. In May 2018, Smokey Rivers (who previously worked for iHeartMedia's Phoenix cluster and KMXZ-FM, and was CBS Radio's president of adult contemporary from 2000 to 2005) was named the station's program director, and began to additionally host afternoons.

It was established on 1 April 1998 and has 3,400 staff providing ambulance and related services to the 3 million residents of Wales. Organisation The trust headquarters is located at St Asaph, Denbighshire. The service is currently divided into three regions: * Central and West Region ‚Äì regional office at Swansea * North Region ‚Äì regional office at St Asaph * South East Region ‚Äì regional office at Cwmbran The service is currently investing heavily as part of a five-year modernisation plan, this will see the end of regions and management will be via Heads of Services aligned to the Health Board areas along with a Head of Service for the Clinical Contact Centres and Head of Service for Production which oversees the resources available within the geographical areas. Services A Welsh Ambulance Service ambulance The trust provides a number of services: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) - responds to emergency 999 calls and GP's urgent calls. A standard crew combination for this service would normally consist of a paramedic and an emergency medical technician. However double paramedic / double technician crews are not uncommon. , the majority of the EMS fleet consists of Wilker Mercedes Benz 519 Sprinter Ambulances and Honda CRV or Ford Focus rapid response vehicles (RRV). Non Emergency Patient Transport Service (NEPTS) - deals with the planned care aspect of ambulance work. NEPTS staff usually provide transport between home and healthcare facilities or some inter-hospital transfers. Urgent Care Service (UCS) - bridges the gap between NEPTS and EMS, allowing for patients to be transferred between home and hospital or hospital to hospital while meeting the advanced needs that some of these patients may have (such as oxygen administration and continuous monitoring). UCS ambulance crews may also be allocated to EMS calls at times of high demand and following clinical telephony triage by a nurse or face to face triage by advanced paramedic practitioners or paramedic practitioners working from a RRV. NHS Direct Wales / 111 Wales - a 24-hour telephone and internet health advice service provided by NHS Wales to enable people to obtain advice when use of the national emergency telephone number (999 or 112) does not seem to be appropriate but there is some degree of urgency. NHS Direct Wales / 111 Wales supports EMS Operations by providing clinical triage for \\"Green 3\\" calls that are deemed suitable. More than 45% of 999 calls have a disposition of not requiring 999 conveyance. In addition during times of escalation other calls deemed suitable are triaged. It does not replace any of the existing emergency or non- emergency medical services but complements those already existing and enables callers who might not be fully able to diagnose themselves to be directed to care of an appropriate level of urgency, including transport to hospital if the diagnosis merits that action. Community First Responders (CFR) - volunteers from the community trained in basic first aid, oxygen administration and the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). They are used by the ambulance service mostly in rural areas to provide basic care, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before an EMS crew arrives. As a CFR is usually only sent to local calls in specified communities, they often arrive before an EMS ambulance crew, even without the use of blue lights and sirens. Whilst most CFR teams are the sole responsibility of WAST, a number of teams (especially in the county of Powys) are made up of regular divisions from St John Ambulance Cymru although this does not give them any exemptions. There are developing numbers of advanced paramedic practitioners in the service who through their extended scope of practice are working toward advancing the service their patients receive with \\"see and treat\\" and \\"see and refer\\" models of care. This removes the need for some patients to travel in an ambulance to A&E.; In 2012, a strategic review of the service was commissioned by the Welsh Government and was conducted by Professor Siobhan McClelland and published in April 2013.

Medications such as baclofen, bupivacaine, clonidine, morphine, or ziconotide may be delivered in this manner to minimize the side effects often associated with the higher doses used in oral or intravenous delivery of these drugs. Medical uses * Some cancer patients with opioid resistant pain or serious side effects may benefit from intrathecal pain management. * Probably, only some benign patients with opioid resistant pain or serious side effects are suitable for intrathecal treatment. Application People with spastic diplegia or other forms of spasticity, or people in intolerable pain, who cannot tolerate side effects of the higher-dose oral medications of the same medication type, are potential candidates for that medication being administered via an intrathecal pump. Construction The implantable intrathecal pump consists of a metal pump which stores and delivers the medication, and an intrathecal catheter which delivers the medication from the pump to the intrathecal space in the spine where the medication takes effect. Two types of pumps are available: a constant rate pump delivers the medication at a constant rate, and a programmable pump delivers the medication according to a rate determined by a computer program. Also external pumps, with or without a subcutaneous port are used for intrathecal delivery. The implantable medical device requires a surgical procedure; sometimes a surgeon performs a trial intrathecal injection or implants a temporary intrathecal catheter and pump to determine if the medication works to begin with, and thus if a pump is appropriate. A permanent intrathecal pump is then implanted if the patient derives at least 50% improvement in his or her symptoms.  Maintenance  = Refills = Intrathecal pumps require maintenance. Individuals who use these pumps will need to come into their physician's office to have the pump refilled. How frequently this occurs is dependent on several factors, including drug concentration and dosage, and pump size. The refill frequency can range between one and six months for baclofen pumps. = Replacement = Intrathecal pumps periodically need to be replaced. For baclofen pumps, this may be once every 5‚Äì7 years.

Thereafter a line of dukes, often largely independent and dynastic from the mid-ninth century, ruled until the coming of the Normans, a new menace they could not weather.

It also provides margin lending, and cash management services. The company was founded as Ameritrade in 1971 before the company acquired competitor TD Waterhouse from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2006. The newly combined company was then renamed TD Ameritrade, with Toronto-Dominion Bank keeping about 40 percent minority ownership. In October 2020, The Charles Schwab Corporation acquired TD Ameritrade in a $22-billion stock deal that gave Toronto-Dominion Bank 13 percent minority ownership in Charles Schwab. TD Ameritrade was originally based in Omaha, Nebraska, with major trading centers in Southlake, Texas and St Louis, Missouri. Charles Schwab plans to move most of the operations to a new combined headquarters in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex. Current operations As of March 31, 2020, TD Ameritrade had more than 12 million client accounts and client assets of approximately $1.2 trillion. In fiscal 2020 second quarter, the company executed an average of 2.1 million daily average revenue trades per day. In fiscal 2019, the company derived 33.3% of its revenues from commissions and fees including payment for order flow, 28.5% of its revenues from the company's bank deposit account program, 25.5% of revenues from interest, 9.7% from investment product fees, and 3% from other sources. History In 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned the practice of fixed brokerage commissions and Joe Ricketts and three partners opened First Omaha Securities, Inc. in Omaha, Nebraska. In 1983, Ameritrade Clearing Inc. was established as a central counterparty clearing broker. In 1988, the company introduced the first quote and order entry system via the push-button telephone. In 1995, the company acquired K. Aufhauser & Company, Inc., the first firm to offer an electronic trading platform. In January 1996, TransTerra's Accutrade launched \\"Accutrade for Windows\\", an electronic trading platform. In September 1996, the company merged with TransTerra. In March 1997, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. In February 2001, the company acquired TradeCast, which had approximately 60 broker-dealer, hedge fund and money management customers, for $67.3 million. In July 2001, the company acquired National Discount Brokers for $154 million, adding $6.3 billion in client assets. In September 2002, the company acquired Datek. In June 2003, the company acquired Mydiscountbroker.com. In 2004, the company acquired Bidwell in January, BrokerageAmerica in February, and JB Oxford and Company in October. In January 2006, the company acquired the United States brokerage business branded as TD Waterhouse from Toronto-Dominion Bank. The newly combined company was renamed TD Ameritrade, with the Toronto-Dominion Bank owning 40%. In February 2008, the company acquired accounts from Fiserv. In May 2008, CEO Joe Moglia announced he would be vacating the CEO position and would become Chairman. He was succeeded as CEO by COO Fredric Tomczyk, who was formerly Vice Chair of Corporate Operations at Toronto-Dominion Bank. In January 2009, the company acquired Thinkorswim, a producer of software for active traders, for $606 million in cash and stock. In 2013, the company opened a new $250 million headquarters in Omaha. In 2016, Tomczyk retired as CEO and succeeded by Tim Hockey, who had previously headed the TD Canada Trust retail banking division of Toronto-Dominion Bank. In September 2017, the company acquired Scottrade, based in St Louis, Missouri, making St. Louis the second-largest hub for the company. The transition of client accounts occurred in February 2018. In April 2018, TD Ameritrade and Havas placed the first advertisement inserted within the bitcoin blockchain. In August 2019, CEO Tim Hockey announced his departure from TD Ameritrade in early Q1 2020. In October of 2019, TD Ameritrade reduced most online trades to being commission free. On November 25, 2019, Charles Schwab Corporation announced its intent to acquire TD Ameritrade for approximately USD $26B in stock. Corporate HQ would relocate from Omaha to Texas. According to Barrons, \\"Ameritrade stock fell an additional 26% after the commission cut\\" in October 2019 and \\"that further stock-price decline opened the door for Schwab to swoop in and buy the [Ameritrade] without paying an equity premium for the trading revenue that it had helped to wipe out\\". Toronto-Dominion Bank will have a 13% ownership stake in the newly combined company. On October 6, 2020, the Charles Schwab-TD Ameritrade merger closed. Charles Schwab says that the two firms will continue to operate as independent brokerages for the next 18 to 36 months until they are fully integrated into one. Legal actions =Security breaches= In November 2007, the company reported that hackers gained access to most of its clients' names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and trading activity. In 2011, after being sued in a class action, the company settled by agreeing to compensate customers that were victim to identity theft between $50 and $2,500 each. The settlement was criticized for netting the attorneys almost as much money as the victims. =Auction rate securities scandal= In 2009, TD Ameritrade settled a lawsuit alleging it had marketed auction rate securities as short-term investments. The settlement included a $456 million payment and the buyback of the securities, compensating investors for losses. =Customer losses in reserve money funds= The company recommended to its customers to invest cash holdings in a money market fund that was an affiliate of the Reserve Primary Fund and the fund gained approximately $1 billion in assets as a result of such marketing by the company. The company received commissions from the fund for steering customers. In September 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, as a result of its holdings in securities of Lehman Brothers, the fund was forced to break the buck and $1 billion in cash equivalents of TD Ameritrade clients were frozen. The company was accused of having a conflict of interest as a result of commissions that it received, for having poor marketing ethics, and for misrepresenting the safety of the investment. Fredric Tomczyk, President of the company, argued that the contract with the Reserve Fund was a standard contract and that \\"an investment firm has to make money in some way.\\" The company was named in class action lawsuits by its customers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its marketing practices. In 2008, the company agreed to reimburse its customers for up to a 3% loss in the Reserve Primary Fund, or up to $50 million. In 2011, the company settled the SEC case and agreed to pay 1.2¬¢ per share of the Reserve Yield Plus Fund that was held by its customers, or $10 million in total. The Reserve Yield Plus made its final distribution in 2016 and investors received 97 to 98 cents per share in addition to compensation from TD Ameritrade. Sponsorships The company owns the naming rights to TD Ameritrade Park Omaha for which it pays an average of $1 million a year.

The album features Lyngstad's anthology of her solo recordings prior to ABBA, which includes the A and B sides of ten 7\\" singles, and rare television and radio performances from this period, as well as her debut album, Frida. History On 3 September 1967, Frida won the national Swedish song contest named \\"New Faces\\", arranged by record company EMI and held at Skansen, Stockholm. The first prize was a recording contract with EMI Sweden. A secret for the winner, not known to Frida, was to perform the song live in a major TV show the same evening. This happened on the same day Sweden went from driving on the left hand to the right hand. That Sunday evening, September 1967, Frida sang her winning song \\"En Ledig Dag\\", (A Free Day or A Day Off) in the TV show. This very first exposure to a wider TV- audience caused a big sensation and so many record companies and composers got in touch with Frida, EMI started to fear they might lose their new singer. To be sure, on the next morning, EMI drove all the way from Stockholm to the town Eskilstuna and ended up in Frida's home with the recording contract for her to sign. EMI producer Olle Bergman said that \\"We got so interested and fond of her, and I thought she had everything a person needs to become something\\". During these early years, Lyngstad did many other radio and TV recordings in Sweden. Various performances can be found in Frida ‚Äì The DVD but they are not included in this set. She spent five years at EMI Sweden before switching to the Polar Music label and joining her bandmates in ABBA in 1972. Her first TV- performance, mentioned above, is included in her documentary DVD. On 11 September 1967, Frida went into Europa Film Studio in Stockholm and recorded \\"En Ledig Dag\\". Professional and self-assured on this first day in the studio, she managed to record the vocals for the song in just one take. The same day, she also recorded the B-side, \\"Peter Kom Tillbaka\\", (Peter Come Back). Among all the songs here is her 1969 attempt in the Swedish for the Eurovision Song Contest with \\"H√§rlig √Ñr V√•r Jord\\" (Our Earth Is Wonderful) when she finished fourth. Her first studio album, \\"Frida\\", was also included in this compilation, which was produced by her then fianc√© Benny Andersson, as well as her first #1 hit in Sweden with \\"Min Egen Stad\\", (My Own Town) in the Svensktoppen chart. (This song includes 3 of the 4 Abba members: Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus, Benny on piano, and Frida). This release also includes clips from the press and critics from the time the songs and album were first released. Frida received unanimously generous praise from the critics, who especially noted the precision and versatility of Frida as a vocalist, hitting every note to perfection. The box set contains pictures of all the singles releases, and alternative photo shots which were never seen before. The bonus tracks on this compilation were recorded for TV. The Frida 1967-1972 compilation saw the CD debut of the rare duet single \\"En Kv√§ll Om Sommar'n\\"/\\"Vi Vet Allt Men N√§stan Inget\\", (One Summer Evening/We Know Everything But Almost Nothing) with Lars Berghagen, recorded in the spring of 1971 to promote a Swedish summer tour in the folkparks, originally released on the Polydor label. The live version of \\"Barnen Sover\\", (The Children Are Sleeping) was recorded on 29 September 1970 for radio show, V√•ra Favoriter (Our Favourites). This was the very first public appearance of Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha F√§ltskog, Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson as a quartet, shortly before their 'Festfolket' tour.

In contrast, non-qualified stock options result in additional taxable income to the recipient at the time that they are exercised, the amount being the difference between the exercise price and the market value on that date. Non-qualified stock options are frequently preferred by employers because the issuer is allowed to take a tax deduction equal to the amount the recipient is required to include in his or her income.

It is situated on the river Eider and the Kiel Canal, approx. north of Rendsburg, and west of Kiel, just off the motorway.  History  The earliest inhabitants of the area which later became B√ºdelsdorf, were Stone-Age people who lived there around 3000 BC. Modern B√ºdelsdorf originates from a small settlement attached to Rendsburg around 1300 AD. Carlsh√ºtte (2010), art and cultural center Kunst in der Carlsh√ºtte (KiC) with sculpture park attached to it In 1777, work on the Eider Canal linking the Baltic Sea to the North Sea began. In 1779, the boundaries of village were defined. In 1827, Hartwig Marcus Holler opened the Carlsh√ºtte, the first industrial-age iron- and steelworks in the duchy. Holler also built a shipyard and created jobs for the factory workers' wives. In 1841, he employed more than 250 workers. In 1895, the Kiel Canal was finished and B√ºdelsdorf and the Carlsh√ºtte flourished. In 1909, the Carlsh√ºtte employed 1,100 workers. B√ºdelsdorf town hall (2010) Development slowed with World War I. However, B√ºdelsdorf grew to be a borough with about 10,000 inhabitants throughout the 20th century. In 1984, B√ºdelsdorf's new town center was opened, consisting of a new town hall, a community centre and several blocks of flats and shops. In 1988, B√ºdelsdorf acquired vast areas of land and managed to attract several companies. As a result, B√ºdelsdorf is a thriving community with about 11,000 inhabitants and 5,000 jobs. In 2000, B√ºdelsdorf war granted the title of town, opening new opportunities for its future development.

A period of decadence followed, also because of the frequent epidemics. In the 18th century, under the Venetian rule, Cerea began to grow and the noblemen started building their villas.

He survived the war only to be mortally wounded in a duel with the Duke of Buckingham who was having an affair with his wife. Life Talbot was the second son of John Talbot, 10th Earl of Shrewsbury, by his first marriage to Mary Fortescue. Talbot was a Captain in the royalist armies during the English Civil War and fought at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Following the royalist defeat there he fled abroad to Europe but returned to England before February 1654, the month he succeeded to his father's earldom, when he petitioned the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, to pardon him for all offences against Parliament. He was suspected of complicity in the unsuccessful royalist rising by Sir George Booth in August 1659 in the period between Cromwell's death and the restoration of King Charles II in 1660. Shrewsbury was readily employed in Charles' court. He bore the Second Sword at the king's coronation in 1661, and in the same year was made Lord Housekeeper of Hampton Court and Treasurer and Receiver-General of Ireland. Lady Anna Maria Brudenell After his first wife and two young sons had died, Shrewsbury (who had succeeded to his father's titles in 1654) married the \\"notorious\\" Lady Anna Maria Brudenell, a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Cardigan, on 10 January 1659. On 16 January 1668, he duelled with one of his wife's lovers, George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and was mortally wounded, dying two months later of his injury. He was buried at the parish church of Albrighton in Shropshire. Samuel Pepys wrote of the incident: His wife is said to have disguised herself as a page and held Villiers' horse during the duel and afterwards slept with him while he wore the blood-stained shirt he had been wearing when he wounded her husband. The earl had had two sons with Maria Brudenell. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles. His second son, John Talbot (1665‚Äì1686), was also killed in a duel by Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton (the illegitimate son of King Charles II), Talbot \\"having given the Duke of Grafton very unhandsome and provoking language\\".

They are found growing epiphytically and terrestrially on embankments in cool, humid, wet areas, 1,000-2,200 m elevation. Flower structure for this genus can be described as globose, nonresupinate flowers that are white to yellow, mostly unspotted, and borne on an erect inflorescence. The epichile is rectangular or ovate (not triangular as in Houelltia), and the lateral projections on the hypochile are broad instead of acute. The pollinarium has a broad, concave viscidium. The plants have ovoid, ridged pseudobulbs, each bearing 2-4 large, pleated leaves. The inflorescences begin from the base of the pseudobulbs and are always pendant, with fleshy, showy flowers hanging downward (\\"nodding\\") on a simple raceme. The dorsal sepal is free and the lateral sepals form a short mentum with the column foot. The petals are similar to the dorsal sepal but smaller.

The cemetery was created to commemorate soldiers of Hong Kong Garrison who perished during both the First World War and the Second World War. According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), the commemorative graves/plaques of 914 soldiers from Undivided India are grouped in 3 memorial locations within the Sai Wan cemetery complex : 104 Indian soldiers whose tombstones are located on the slopes of Sai Wan Cemetery, 287 more Indian soldiers interred at Sai Wan Memorial while a further 118 Indian soldiers whose remains were cremated according to their religious customs are inscribed on commemorative plaques at the Sai Wan Cremation Memorial. The Sai Wan War Cemetery contains the graves of 228 Canadians.Canadian Encyclopedia Monuments, World Wars I and II Background On 8 December 1941 ‚Äì less than eight hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor ‚Äì Japanese forces launched an invasion into Hong Kong, then a British Crown colony. The invasion started a lesser-known chapter of World War II when Allied forces ‚Äì mainly British, Indian and Canadian ‚Äì began the futile defence of British Hong Kong. Records now show that the territory had been deemed militarily undefendable by the War Office. Even so, the garrison was ordered to put up a robust resistance and six infantry battalions were tasked with the defence of Hong Kong. Several locations including Shing Mun Redoubt along the Gin Drinkers' Line, Wong Nai Chung Gap, Mount Butler, shores bordering Lye Moon Passage, Devil's Peak and Stanley Fort saw fierce combat which resulted in overwhelming casualties among Allied Troops. The Japanese forces from Shenzhen easily crossed the Sham Chun River, and entered into the territory through the Mainland in the north. The three British Army battalions manning the Gin Drinkers Line were the 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots to the west, the 2/14th Battalion, Punjab Regiment in the centre and the 5/7th Battalion, Rajput Regiment to the east. The 5/7 Rajput of the Indian Army bore the heaviest casualty losses amongst all defending combatant battalions engaged in the Battle of Hong Kong: 156 killed in action or died from wounds, 113 missing, and 193 wounded. The 2/14 Punjab of the Indian Army also bore heavy losses: 55 killed in action or died from wounds, 69 missing, and 161 wounded. Hong Kong and Singapore Royal Artillery, which was raised with troops recruited from Undivided India, also suffered heavy casualties during the Battle of Hong Kong and are commemorated with names inscribed on panels at the entrance to Sai Wan War Cemetery: 144 killed, 45 missing and 103 wounded. Intense battles were fought on Hong Kong Island until the British surrendered the territory at the end of the month on Christmas Day. The surrender marked the beginning of the Japanese occupation of the territory and would last until the Japanese unconditionally surrendered three years later. Casualties were heavy among defending forces during the battle, but many more succumbed to disease, drowning, maltreatment, or execution during their long captivity in Hong Kong and Japan, and transportation between the two. The majority of the fallen Allied soldiers from the campaign, including British, Canadian and Indian soldiers were eventually interred at the Sai Wan Military Cemetery. A total of 1,528 soldiers, mainly from the Commonwealth, are commemorated here. Most of the remaining burials are located at the Stanley Military Cemetery. Location Signs on Cape Collinson Road leading to cemeteries in the vicinity of Sai Wan War Cemetery The cemetery is located on the western slope of Pottinger Peak at the north-eastern corner of Hong Kong Island. The site of the cemetery is situated midway up on the north side of Mount Collinson on Cape Collinson Road. The site gradually slopes down towards the sea which used to provide a magnificent view of the harbour narrow at Lei Yue Mun. Incidentally Lei Yue Mun was where the Japanese had crossed the harbour on the evening of 18 December and landed on Hong Kong Island. That same night 20 gunners at the Sai Wan Battery were massacred. Today, the view of the harbour is obstructed by residential high rises in Chai Wan, and only on a clear day Kowloon would be visible across the harbour. The area also has a few other cemeteries. The Holy Cross Roman Catholic Cemetery; Hong Kong Military Cemetery; and the Cape Collinsion Muslim and Buddhist Cemeteries are within walking distance from one another. Further east just a few hundred meters away on the side of Pottinger Peak is the larger Cape Collinson Chinese Permanent Cemetery. One of 444 unidentified burials at the cemetery, of which 118 are from Undivided India and 107 are Canadian. The cemetery Layout of Sai Wan War Cemetery Memorial panels at Sai Wan War Cemetery The cemetery was built in 1946. It is now one of the many maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission since the land has been leased since 1953. A memorial hall the entrance into the cemetery bears panels with the names of more than 2,000 Commonwealth servicemen who died in the Battle of Hong Kong or subsequently in captivity and those who have no known grave. Additional panels form the cremation memorial bearing the names of 144 British Indian Army casualties whose remains were cremated in accordance with their faith. Also, the Sai Wan (China) Memorial commemorating 72 casualties of both World Wars whose graves in mainland China could not be maintained can be found at the memorial hall. Twenty local soldiers and eight civilians are also buried here. A plaque displaying the battle and army advances gives visitors the insight into the extent of the campaign. The physical layout of the cemetery on the slope of Mount Collinsion has British graves at the top most level, Canadian and Dutch graves in the middle and the graves of soldiers from Undivided India at the lower portion of the slope. Recently relocated graves of soldiers from Undivided India who died in World War II have been moved from cemeteries in Kowloon to the bottom edge of Sai Wan War Cemetery. The war graves are marked with white upright granite headstones depicting the appropriate regiment or service's insignia. The cemetery is enclosed within a wall of flowering shrubs and bushes. Storm-water drainage ditches run along the two sides of the cemetery from top to bottom. An Altar of Remembrance, bearing the words from Sirach: \\"Their name liveth for evermore\\" marks the top of the flight of stone steps leading down a center aisle towards the Cross of Sacrifice. Both the cemetery and memorial were designed by Colin St. Clair Oakes. Other than those died in defence of Hong Kong, the remains of POWs who died in Taiwan were brought to Sai Wan for burial as well. There are now 1,528 casualties of World War II buried or commemorated at Sai Wan War Cemetery, 444 of the burials are unidentified. The unidentified were marked with the words: Known Unto God. In addition, there are special memorials to 16 World War II casualties buried in a Kowloon Muslim cemetery whose graves were lost. There are also 77 war graves of other nationalities from this period, the majority of them Dutch. The cemetery also contains special memorials to 12 World War I and 28 World War II graves which were earlier in two Muslim cemeteries (Number 3 Muslim Cemetery at Ho Man Tin and Mohammeden Cemetery at Ta Sek Ku near Mong Kok) whose graves have since been lost due to urban redevelopment. Notable graves The headstone of Brigadier J.K. Lawson. About 280 servicemen were from Canada, including Brigadier John K. Lawson. Lawson was the highest-ranking officer to be killed in action during the defence of Hong Kong, his remains were originally buried by the Japanese at Wong Nai Chung Gap during the occupation but were reburied at the cemetery. Another of two Major General Lancelot Ernest Dennys and Merton Beckwith-Smith were also buried in this cemetery. Company Sergeant-Major John Robert Osborn, recipient of a Victoria Cross awarded for the defence of Hong Kong, has no grave at this cemetery, but his name is engraved on the memorial hall.Canadian Virtual War Memorial Gallery File:HK SaiWanWarCemetery Canadian.JPGHeadstones of Canadian soldiers at Sai Wan War Cemetery File:Indian section of Sai Wan War Cemetery December 2017.jpgHeadstones of Indian soldiers at Sai Wan War Cemetery File:Sai Wan Dutch Headstones.jpgHeadstones of Dutch soldiers at Sai Wan War Cemetery File:HK SaiWanWarCemetery Sai Wan Memorial.JPGSai Wan War Cemetery, Stone of Remembrance File:HK SaiWanWarCemetery NamesOfDeathPanels.JPGSai Wan War Cemetery Memorial Panels File:HK SaiWanWarCemetery Entrance.JPGSai Wan War Cemetery File:Siu Sai Wan Aerial.jpg Aerial view of Cape Collinson, Siu Sai Wan and western slope of Pottinger Peak See also * Stanley Military Cemetery * List of cemeteries in Hong Kong References * * Sai Wan Military Cemetery External links * Category:Cemeteries in Hong Kong Category:Military of Hong Kong Category:Chai Wan Category:Canadian military memorials and cemeteries Category:Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries in Hong Kong Category:World War II sites in Hong Kong Category:World War II cemeteries ","title":"Sai Wan War Cemetery"},{"id":"4882239","text":"Nortorf is a town in the district of Rendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde, in Schleswig- Holstein, Germany.

In some ships the 2-pounder was replaced a single or twin 20 mm Oerlikon AA gun, while most ships were fitted with four additional single Oerlikon mounts over the course of the war. For escort work, her minesweeping gear could be exchanged for around 40 depth charges. Construction and career Rye was built by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. in Troon, Scotland and commissioned in 1941. Her pennant number was J 76. Rye served in the Mediterranean Sea based in Malta as part of the 14th/17th Minesweeper Flotilla. She took part in the Malta Convoys, notably Operation Harpoon during which she rescued 84 survivors from the SS Chant, and in Operation Pedestal during which she was one of the ships that rescued the SS Ohio. The Ryes captain, Iain Pearson, was awarded a bar to his DSC for service during the Malta Convoys. After the Mediterranean, Rye returned to Home waters and served with the 14th M/S Flotilla based in Plymouth. She was part of Operation Neptune, the naval component of Operation Overlord (D-Day). The flotilla participated in minesweeping operations from 5‚Äì30 June, initially clearing paths through the German minefields to the invasion beaches, and subsequently clearing wider areas to allow transport and supply vessels to operate in safety.  Postwar  Rye was decommissioned on 24 August 1948. She was scrapped at Purfleet in Essex in September 1948. Her ensign is laid up in St Mary's parish church in the town of Rye, East Sussex.

Mullazai, also known as Malazai or Malay zai or Mali Zai, is a Pashtun Marwat village. Geography Mullazai lies at an altitude of 255 m (839 ft) and is situated to the north-west of the Indus River and close to the District of Tank. At a distance of 200 miles from Peshawar and about 40 miles from the city of Tank, Pakistan, which is the capital for the region. Mullazai is hot and humid in summers, when the temperature in Mullazai can reach 110-120 ¬∞F.  Origin  It has a population of around more than 80,000, the second biggest in Tank district. The people of Mullazai are known as Marwats. Mala Zai (or Mali Zai) was the second son of Nona, who was the third son of Marwat Clans of the village include Khwaji Khel, Nazar Khel and Haji Khel. These are the direct descendants of Malazai (Malay zai), through Khadar the grandson of Nona. Other clans like Sain Khel, Pehlawan Khel, Salmanzai and Jang-e-khel claim to be Marwats but are disputed by historians. Most of them are ethnic minorities migrated and settled in Mullazai in later times. Some of the most notable people from the village include the late Lt Col. Sarfaraz Khan, probably the most important, who was awarded the title of Ghaz-e-Kashmir and was nominated to be a member of the Federal Council Majlis-Shoora in 1980 by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Economy The economy of the village mainly depends on farming and engineering. Also, many of the village's inhabitants work in the local schools and hospitals. Agriculture is dependent on the significant local rainfall and from tube wells. Many people from this village also work as contractors in Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

People  Family administration in the area is headed by the father or elder of the family. The game of Maila is popular in the area. The game consists of three people from one village attempting to topple three people from another village, whilst all standing on one leg. Celebrations ensue when the game is over, by the winning villagers lighting fires and dancing until late in the night. The local Jirga make the local religious decisions and maintain the customs of the area based on their set of laws and principles. If any of the villagers die, not only do the relatives, but all the adult villagers, both men and women, go to the bereaved family. There, they will spend the whole night reciting the Quran for the affected family. To console the bereaved family after the dead are buried, they stay with them for three consecutive nights and render as much help as they can to the bereaved family and pray for the deceased person.

It documents a long causal chain assembled of everyday objects and industrial materials in the manner of a Rube Goldberg machine, though without the trope of accomplishing a relatively mundane task at the end. Description The installation was in the artists' Z√ºrich warehouse studio, about 100 feet long, and incorporated materials such as tires, trash bags, ladders, soap, oil drums, old shoes, water, and gasoline. Fire and pyrotechnics were used as chemical triggers. The film is 29 minutes and 45 seconds long, but some of that is spent waiting for something to burn, dissolve, or slowly slide down a ramp. Long processes with little visible change are skipped with a fade out/fade in. The film is presented as a single sequence of events, but careful observation reveals over two dozen film edits. The film evolved out of work the artists did on their earlier photography series, Quiet Afternoon, () of 1984-1985. As the delicately unstable assemblages they constructed for the photos were apt to almost immediately collapse, they decided that they wanted to make use of this energy. The film may also have been inspired by the video work of fellow Swiss artist Roman Signer. The artists likely saw his video work which was exhibited at the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich in 1981.Mack, Gerhard. ‚Äú'Modulations of Time and Space': The Work of Roman Signer.‚Äù In Roman Signer. (London: Phaidon, 2006). Page 86. Signer's videos often document objects performing simple actions that are the result of physical phenomena. Copyright dispute with Honda In May 2003, Fischli and Weiss threatened legal action against Honda over similarities between the Cog commercial and The Way Things Go. The artists felt that the ad's creators had \\"obviously seen\\" their film, and should have consulted them. Fischli and Weiss had refused several requests to use the film for commercial purposes, though Honda claimed that this was irrelevant as their permission was not needed to create new works with some elements similar to their previous works. Honda's advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy eventually admitted to copying a sequence of weighted tires rolling uphill. The controversy was blamed for denying Cog a Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Exhibitions The movie was a public highlight of the documenta 8 exhibition in Kassel, Germany (June - September 1987), and is on permanent exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and in the Museum Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden.

She was known as the \\"eternal flapper\\". Biography Hopper was born on January 17, 1872 as Edna Margaret Augusta Wallace in San Francisco, California to Josephine and Waller Wallace. Hopper claimed her birth records were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Her father was the head night usher at the California Theater. She had one sibling. Hopper trained for the stage in New York. While there, she had married DeWolf Hopper on June 28, 1893. They appeared in several comic operas together, including John Philip Sousa's El Capitan, before divorcing in 1898. The couple presented a striking physical contrast on stage. DeWolf, at 6 ft 5 in, was tall for that time, while Hopper stood under five feet tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. Edna Wallace and DeWolf Hopper in the musical Panjandrum (1893) Hopper starred in her most famous role, Lady Holyrood in the popular musical Florodora, which had premiered in London. Though not part of the renowned Florodora Sextette, she shared in some of the wild adulation of male admirers who mobbed the stage door after every performance. Hopper remained active over the next decade, starring in George M. Cohan's Fifty Miles from Boston in 1907. She married Wall Street broker Albert Oldfield Brown in 1908. Her professional activity lessened in the 1910s but resumed in the 1920s. One of the earlier stage actors to have a facelift, Wallace Hopper had the operation filmed and then made personal appearance tours over the next eight years showing the film and revealing beauty tips. Her name became associated with a line of personal care products and cosmetics, Edna Wallace Hopper Cosmetics, sold by American Home Products. In 1953 she performed the same role she had begun her acting career with in 1893, at the final performance at the Empire Theater in Manhattan, which was scheduled for demolition. The June 8, 1953 issue of Life Magazine featured an article on Hopper, considering her a popular stage actress and singer during the turn of the 20th Century. Hopper separated from her second husband, and he later died on March 5, 1945. She went on to become the only woman of the thirty-six member board of L. F. Rothschild & Co. Hopper died on December 14, 1959 in New York City. She is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.

History The event evolved out of a dispute concerning spending for the 2006 Gay Games (formally called Gay Games VII), which Montreal had been awarded. However, the Gay Games sanctioners (Federation of Gay Games) and Montreal 2006 quarrelled over the budget and scale of the Games and the amount of control each party would exercise; subsequently, the FGG parted company with Montreal, awarding the games to Chicago.

With attendance of some 2,000 participants, it was the largest conference on LGBT rights ever held. The four-day conference consisted of five plenary sessions on the United States and Canada, Africa and the Arab World, Latin America, Asia and the Pacific, and Europe, in addition to the opening and closing sessions. Keynote speakers included G√©rald Tremblay, Gene Robinson, Mark Tewksbury, Irshad Manji, Mariela Castro, Georgina Beyer, Waheed Alli, Martin Cauchon, Li Yinhe and Martina Navratilova. Louise Arbour, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, delivered an especially well-received speech at the opening dinner, which gave particular encouragement to the conference's goal of recognition at the United Nations. There were also more than a hundred workshops on more specific themes, as well as programmes of workshops on sport, business, and international affairs. The conference concluded with the issuance of the Declaration of Montreal on LGBT Human Rights, a declaration that will be submitted to the United Nations. Opening Ceremonies Opening ceremonies of the 2006 World Outgames Opening Ceremonies for the 1st Outgames Montreal 2006 were held at the Olympic Stadium on Saturday, July 29, 2006. The performance was broadcast by Radio-Canada, Canada's national French-language public broadcaster. After the parade of nations, the Declaration of Montreal was read by Mark Tewksbury and Martina Navratilova. G√©rald Tremblay, Mayor of Montreal, Line Beauchamp, Quebec Minister of Culture, and Michael Fortier, federal Minister of Public Works, represented the three levels of government; Fortier was loudly booed, reflecting anger among the LGBT community regarding the Conservative government's stances on gay rights, including the announcement of a motion to reopen debate on the Civil Marriage Act and same-sex marriage in Canada. Lights at the Olympic Stadium, Outgames Opening, click to enlarge After the athletes' and officials' oath were taken by Charles Boyer and Diane Bandy respectively, Mayor Tremblay officially declared the Outgames open. Using the theme of \\"the circle\\", the concept of the show integrated music, song, dance, choruses, mass choreography and performances by the Cirque du Soleil. Artists who performed at the opening ceremonies included: *k.d. lang *Martha Wash *Deborah Cox *Jonas *Sylvie Desgroseilliers *Diane Dufresne *Cirque du Soleil Venues Over 50 venues in Montreal hosted events for the 1st World Outgames. Three main areas gathered most of the activities, the largest being the Claude Robillard Sports Complex, in addition to the Montreal Olympic Park and the Jean Drapeau Park. The Outgames used most of the venues built for the Montreal Summer Olympics of 1976. Other venues included the Golf Metropolitain Anjou for golfing, the Parc du Domaine Vert √† Mirabel for mountain biking, the Little Italy neighbourhood for the Cycling Criterium, as well as various parks across the city for sports such as soccer, tennis and softball. The main social and entertainment location for non-sporting events during the 2006 Outgames was located at the west side of Viger Square. 35 Sporting events contested including *Rowing *Aerobics *Billiards *Badminton *Dragon Boat Regatta *Table tennis *Figure Skating *Tennis *Golf *Track and Field *Handball *Triathlon *Ice hockey *Volleyball *Karate *Water Polo *Marathon *Wrestling *Physique *Outsplash http://montreal2006.info/en_sports.html Participating teams * English Bay Triathlon Club * Team Vancouver * Team Frankfurt a.

The CGT was formed in March 1940 at a congress held in San Juan. The congress was attended by delegates from 42 unions, and it had an initial membership of 72,000. The small Puerto Rican Communist Party played a leading role in its development. One offshoot of the General Confederation of Workers is the similarly named General Confederation of Farmers. The CGT quickly surpassed the older Free Federation of Workers (FLT) as the largest union federation in Puerto Rico. It affiliated with the US Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and like the CIO it organized workers based on industrial unionism. As the CGT grew closer politically to the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), the radical wing of the federation broke off and formed the General Confederation of Workers (Authentic).

It has black plumage with a prominent yellow shoulder on its wing. Adult males and females are of similar appearance. The species is predominantly insectivorous. Taxonomy The nominate form of the yellow- shouldered blackbird (A. x. xanthomus) was first described from Puerto Rico and Vieques in 1862 by Philip Sclater as Icterus xanthomus. The species is closely related to, and possibly derived from, the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius pheoniceus). The tawny-shouldered blackbird (Agelaius humeralis), a species from Cuba and Haiti, is morphologically intermediate between A. xanthomus and A. humeralis. Until recently, some authors considered A. xanthomus as a subspecies of A. humeralis. The 1983 American Ornithologists' Union edition considered A. xanthomus, together with A. humeralis, a superspecies. The main physical difference between A. xanthomus and A. humeralis resides in their bills, with A. humerali being broader toward the base. The recognized subspecies A. x. monensis, or Mona yellow-shouldered blackbird, was described by Barnes in 1945 from the islands of Mona and Monito. Description The yellow-shouldered blackbird, as its name implies, is a glossy black bird with a small yellow humeral patch around its \\"shoulders\\" outlined by a white margin. Immature individuals possess a duller coloration and a brown abdomen. Although plumage coloration is indistinguishable between the sexes, sexual dimorphism is present in this species with males being larger than females. Plumage abnormality is rare in this species. Adult individuals measure from ; on average, males weigh and females weigh . Sexual categorization may also be made by measurement of the wings, with males' being 1.1 times larger and having a mean length of , while females' wings have an average length of . Distribution and habitat Caja de Muertos off the southern coast of Puerto Rico, habitat of the yellow- shouldered blackbird. The species was once commonly found in the coastal forests of the archipelago of Puerto Rico but during the early 20th century these forests were destroyed to allow for the development of sugarcane plantations. After the decline of the sugar industry after the 1930s the coastal areas were developed for housing. As a result, the species is now limited to three areas: the islands of Mona and Monito, where a subspecies developed (A. g. xmonensis); the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station area in eastern Puerto Rico; and the southern Puerto Rican dry forests and mangroves. Although all three locations are considered coastal subtropical dry forests, the species has been observed as far inland as the mountain town of Lares and in subtropical wet forests during the non-breeding season. The species has also been observed at the Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge. The destruction of habitat and brood parasitism by the shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) led to a drastic population decline from the mid-1970s to early 1980s. In 1976, the population of the nominate form was estimated at 2000 individuals but in 1982 the population estimate dropped to 300 individuals. Conservation efforts have increased the population to 1250 pairs. In 1976 Post and Wiley estimated the Mona subspecies population at 200 individuals. Subsequent roost counts and studies from 1981 to 1995 estimated the population at anywhere between 220 and 400 individuals. Studies performed in the island of Monito, located northwest of Mona, revealed an average of 25 individuals with breeding being observed. The studies also revealed that birds traveled from the west coast of Mona to Monito. Yellow-shouldered blackbirds are non-migratory birds, but a portion of the population of the nominate form moves from coastal areas to inland areas during the non-breeding season to feed. Diet Yellow-shouldered blackbirds are omnivorous, but are considered to be arboreal insectivores since the majority of their diet consists of insects. William Post performed studies to determine the dietary habits of the nominate form A. x. xanthomus. The studies analyzed samples of food parents brought to nestlings, and found evidence of consumption of insects belonging to the orders Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Dermaptera and Hymenoptera, arachnid material of the order Araneae, unidentified molluscs, and plant matter. Aside from natural material, the species also consumes processed food such as cattle ration, human food (cooked rice and sugar), dog food and monkey chow. Plant matter was acquired from processed foods while insects are gleaned from the canopy and sub-canopy layers of trees. During the nesting season their diet is composed of 90% arthropod material. Studies have not been performed to determine the dietary habits of the Mona subspecies, but consumption of insects, spiders, fruits from Pithecellobium species and the cacti Selenicereus species, Pilosocereus royenii, Harrisia portoricensis, and Opuntia species, seeds from gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba) and Ficus species and nectar from Aloe vera, yucca and Croton discolor have been observed. Reproduction and behavior The yellow-shouldered blackbird breeding season commonly spans from April to August but breeding activity has been observed from February to November. The breeding season's start coincides with the start of the rainy season, thus explaining the fluctuation in the start and end of the breeding season. The species is believed to be monogamous with a single attempt at nesting per year and with nesting being performed in loose colonies. Nests of both the nominate form and the Mona subspecies contain from one to four eggs with an average of three. Eggs are blue-green with brown spots and are incubated for 13 days by the female. Both sexes reach sexual maturity at one year of age. As with other Agelaius species, it usually builds open, cup-shaped nests in trees, but nest locations and shapes may vary depending on location and availability of building materials. The Roosevelt Roads' population builds nests on hollows in dead mangroves, while the Mona subspecies builds nests in ledges or crevices near the coastal cliffs. In all, the species uses eight distinct nesting habitats: mudflats and salinas; offshore red mangrove cays; black mangrove forest; lowland pastures (dry coastal forest); suburban areas; coconut plantations; and coastal cliffs. Building of the nest is performed solely by females while feeding of the young is performed by both sexes. Nestlings leave the nest 13 to 16 days after hatching. Males defend small territories, usually around 3 metres, during the nesting period. Before the nesting period males defend slightly larger territories to repel other males. Yellow-shouldered blackbirds engage in anting, a rare behavior only observed in the Puerto Rican tanager among West Indian birds. Individuals were observed applying Pheidole species ants to their body and feathers for a short period of time (8 minutes). The species engages in mobbing, a behavior in which a pack of birds, from one or more species, attack a known predator (usually to defend eggs or hatchlings). Threats and conservation efforts Critical habitat in southwest Puerto Rico for the yellow-shouldered blackbird The yellow-shouldered blackbird was listed as an endangered species on November 19, 1976 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Critical habitat was subsequently established for the entire Mona and Monito islands, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, an area expanding from Cabo Rojo to Gu√°nica in the southwest region of Puerto Rico, and a small area in San Germ√°n. Diseases such as avian pox have been associated with extinction of bird populations such as Hawaiian honeycreepers. For this species only one type of parasite has been observed, the chewing louse (formerly classified as Mallophaga), with three species being observed: Philopterus agelaii; Machaerilaemus species; and Myrsidea species. The parasites predominantly occur in the head area with adult males having the highest infestation percentage and juveniles having a lower infestation rate than adults. The mites Ornithonyssus bursa and Androlaelaps casalis have also been observed in nests, but the information presently available does not indicate they are a threat. Another disease commonly experienced by yellow- shouldered blackbirds is fowlpox, also known as avian pox. Lesions caused by this disease occur in exposed areas such as the legs and the bend of the wings. Nest predation has been an important contributor to the decline of the yellow-shouldered blackbird. Known terrestrial predators include rats (Rattus rattus), mongooses and feral cats, all introduced species to Puerto Rico. Rats constituted the main nest predator eating both eggs and hacthlings. A 1983 report concluded that rat predation accounted for 48% of nest failures that year. The majority of the activity coincided with the recession of water from July to August which exposed the mangrove nesting area to dry land. Since the middle 1980s artificial PVC nesting structures have been created in mudflats surrounding mangrove forests to reduce rat predation. These structures replaced old wooden nesting boxes and were readily accepted by the species. Presently, few (one or two) natural nests are observed each year in the area. The loss of feeding and breeding habitat and brood parasitism by the shiny cowbird are among other threats that limit and endanger the yellow-shouldered blackbird populations. Natural predators, such as the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus), also represent a threat, although minor, to the populations. These animals have been reported to steal eggs and young from nests and to also destroy or steal nesting materials which in many cases leaves the young as prey for the predators.

Noori's memo accused him of the following: Transcript Noori chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. On March 3, 2006, in response to a court order from Jed Rakoff the Department of Defense published a single page Summarized transcript from his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. Mohammon v. Bush, Civil Action No. 05-2386 Adel Noori was one of the petitioners in Mohammon v. Bush, Civil Action No. 05-2386. In September 2007, the Department of Justice published dossiers of unclassified documents arising from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 179 captives. The Department of Defense withheld Adel Noori's documents when they published the documents from the other 179 habeas petitioner's CSR Tribunals. On July 18, 2008, George M. Clarke III informed the US District Court that: = Administrative Review Board = Detainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them \\"enemy combatants\\" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention. Summary of Evidence memo A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Adel Noori's Administrative Review Board, on July 1, 2005. The memo listed factors for and against his continued detention. The following primary factors favor continued detention The following primary factors favor release or transfer Board recommendations In early September 2007, the Department of Defense released two heavily redacted memos, from his Board, to Gordon R. England, the Designated Civilian Official. The Board's recommendation was unanimous The Board's recommendation was redacted. England authorized his transfer on October 22, 2005. 2005 through 2008 On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court restored the Guantanamo captives' access to the USA's civilian justice system in its ruling on Boumediene v. Bush. Specifically it re-initiated the captives' habeas corpus petitions. In an unrelated development Huzaifa Parhat's DTA appeal concluded that his Combatant Status Review Tribunal had erred in confirming he was an \\"enemy combatant\\", due to insufficient evidence. The Department of Justice had the option of appealing the ruling, claiming it had new evidence. The Uyghurs' habeas petitions were the first to be scheduled for review. In September 2008, days before the Department of Justice would have been expected to offer a justification in court for the Uyghurs' detention, and after six and half years of extrajudicial detention, the Department of Justice acknowledged the evidence to justify their detention did not exist. Temporary Asylum in Palau In June 2009 the government of Palau announced that they would offer temporary asylum to some of the Uyghurs. The government of Palau sent a delegation to Guantanamo, and interviewed some of the remaining Uyghurs. Some of the Uyghurs declined to be interviewed by the Palauns. In the end the government of Palau offered asylum to twelve of the remaining thirteen Uyghurs. Palau declined to offer asylum to one of the Uyghurs who suffered from a mental disorder, brought on by detention, that was too profound to be treated in Palau. On October 31, 2009, Adel Noori, Ahmad Tourson, Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman, Edham Mamet, Anwar Hassan, and Dawut Abdurehim were released and transferred to Palau. Noori worked as a security guard at the Palau Community College. Reappearance in Turkey On February 14, 2013, the Associated Press reported that Noori had \\"missing since late last year\\" from Palau. The Uyghurs were not eligible for Palaun citizenship, so Noori had no legitimate travel documents. The Associated Press quoted a report from Tia Belau, a local newspaper, that speculated Noori may have been trying to make his way to Turkey, to join his wife and child. The Tia Belau reported that Noori had not been seen at work for two months. They reported he had traveled through Japan, but Japanese officials could not refute or confirm this. Carol Rosenberg, of the McClatchy News Services, confirmed on February 20, 2013, that US officials knew Noori had joined his wife in Turkey, although the officials she spoke with insisted on anonymity. Joshua Keating of Foreign Policy magazine noted that \\"Noori's relocation is particularly impressive given that he is technically stateless and has no travel documents.\\" On June 29, 2015, Nathan Vanderklippe, reporting in The Globe and Mail, wrote that all the Uyghurs had quietly left Palau. The Globe confirmed that Palau's agreement to give refuge to the Uyghurs was reached after the USA agreed to various secret payments. Those payments included $93,333 to cover each Uyghurs living expenses. The Globe confirmed that controversy still surrounded former President Johnson Toribiong who had used some of those funds to billet the Uyghurs in houses belonging to his relatives. Vanderklippe reported that the men had never felt they could fit in with the Palauns. Some of the men compared Palau with a lusher, larger Guantanamo. Some of the men were able to bring their wives to Palau. Attempts to hold most regular jobs failed, due to cultural differences. Attempts to use their traditional leather-working skills to be self-employed failed. Eventually, all six men were employed as night- time security guards, a job that did not require interaction with Palauns. One of the men's young toddler, born on Palau, died when he fell from a balcony. According to Vanderklippe, the men's departure from Palau was quietly arranged with cooperation with American officials. He reported they left, one or two at a time, on commercial flights. Palaun officials would not share the Uyghurs destination.

This includes the territory of what was once Anglo- Egyptian Sudan, as well as this area's long and diverse history. The oldest existing records of the precursors of a distinctive Sudanese literature can be dated to about 300 BCE and were written in the Meroitic script. These historical records, such as inscriptions on sandstone, bear testimony of the kings of Kush or deities of the Kushite culture in northern Sudan. During the 6th century Christianization of Nubia, the Kushite language and cursive script were replaced by Byzantine Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian languages, with texts relating both to religion, to public affairs or to private life. From the fourteenth century onwards, Arabic became the primary language in Nubia and, with the spread of Islam, developed into the main written and spoken language for religious and secular affairs in other parts of Sudan. \\"Long before the novel and short story became known as literary genres, Sudanese literature existed in the form of oral stories and narrative poems, most of which, until recently, were transmitted from one generation to the next.\\", as literary critic Eiman El-Nour put it in his seminal paper The Development of Contemporary Literature in Sudan. Through the spread of written literature in Sudanese newspapers, as well as through formal, non-religious education in the 20th century and beyond, a modern Sudanese literature of fiction and nonfiction in Arabic began to appear.On the notion of a modern national literature in Africa, compare the following definition by Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe: \\"A national literature is one that takes the whole nation for its province and has a realized or potential audience throughout its territory. An ethnic literature is one which is available to one ethnic group within the nation.\\" Chinua Achebe. Morning Yet on Creation Day (New York: Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1976), p. 75 Some modern writers with Sudanese roots and living in other countries, like Leila Aboulela or Jamal Mahjoub, write in English and, together with translations of original works written in Arabic, have made fictional literature about Sudan accessible to a wider audience. Traditional and modern forms of oral literature Literature in Sudan of today is either orally told, recited or written in the Arabic language, with certain types also in local languages, such as poetry in the Fur language of western Sudan.\\"Some of the other major languages of the Sudan which possess both oral literature and written material, either in grammars, dictionaries, or recently compiled dual language folkloric text are Dinka, Fur, Nuer, Shilluk, Azande and Bari.\\" As in other African countries, both written literature and genres of oral tradition, such as folk tales, proverbs or poems, are common, but depend on their social setting, such as in rural, partly illiterate or in urban educated societies. These oral types of storytelling may be simply recited by individuals or by groups of persons, or they may be accompanied by singing and musical accompaniments, thus transgressing the theoretical definition of literature and music.Nigerian literary critic Mbube Nwi-Akeeri explained that Western theories cannot effectively capture and explain oral literature, particularly those indigenous to regions such as Africa. The reason is that there are elements to oral traditions in these places that cannot be captured by words alone, such as gestures, dance, and the interaction between the storyteller and the audience. According to Nwi-Akeeri, oral literature is not only a narrative, but also a social performance. Cf. Nwi-Akeeri, Mbube (2017). Oral literature in Nigeria: A Search for Critical Theory. Research Journal of Humanities and Cultural Studies, vol. 3. ISSN 2579-0528 Among the living oral traditions, there are the Ahaji folk tales and the Madih, or religious praise tales. The first kind generally have a mythological and often local character. According to literary critic Eiman El-Nour, \\"they invariably have happy endings and are full of fanciful scenes and superstitions that describe the magic powers of genies and ogres.\\" Madih, the other kind of poetry is typically recited by a singer and chorus, and has a religious character, praising the prophet Muhammad or revered religious leaders. From the beginning of modern written literature, and going back to age-old oral traditions, poetry and songs have been the most popular genres in Sudan. Before independence, poems and the lyrics of songs were expressions of nationalism and other political issues. An important poet, whose patriotic verses have been used in popular songs like \\"Azza fƒ´ HawƒÅk\\" (My beloved Azza) was Khalil Farah (1892-1932). To this day, poetry and songs have occupied a prominent role in Sudanese culture. Songs celebrating the beauty of the land, its regions and sceneries like the Nile valley or her people have been very popular in modern music since at least the 1930s. During modern times of political oppression, these forms of oral literature have been expressions of resistance towards the rulers of the day, and have led to the imprisonment or exile of poets like Mahjoub Sharif (1948 - 2014) or musicians like Mohammed Wardi (1932 - 2012). A traditional form of oral poetry are the songs of praise or ridicule by female singers of Western Sudan, called Hakamat. These are women of high social standing, respected for their eloquence, intuition and decisiveness, who may both incite or vilify the men of their tribe, when engaged in feuds with other tribes. The social impact of these Hakamat can be so strong, that they have recently been invited by peacebuilding initiatives in Darfur in order to exert their influence for conflict resolution or other social issues, like environmental protection. Contemporary forms of oral literature in urban settings as an expression of identity, political resistance or visions of the future are the forms of spoken word poetry, political slogans, rap, or hip hop music that preceded and accompanied the Sudanese Revolution of 2018/19.  Modern Sudanese literature written in Arabic  According to literary scholar Constance E. Berkley, \\"Sudanese Arabic literature has links with all Arabic literature, both past and present. At the same time, it is valid in its own right. Among the Sudanese, as among other African and/or Arabic speaking people, poetry is the preferred literary form.\\" On the further issue of writing in Arabic with a distinct Sudanese character, the Sudanese poet and critic Mohammed Abdul-Hayy writes: \\"Muhammad Ahmed Mahgoub was one of the leading literary spokesmen who (...) expressed the idea of a Sudanese literature 'written in Arabic, but infused with the idiom of our land, because this (idiom) is what distinguishes a literature of one nation from another.'\\"Muhammad Abdel Hai, Conflict and Identity: The Cultural Poetics of Contemporary Sudanese Poetry (Khartoum University Press. 1976), p.21, quoted after Although there were several newspapers published in Sudan around the beginning of the 20th century, arguably the most important newspaper in terms of impact on modern Sudanese literature was \\"Al-Ra'id\\" (The Pioneer). This paper, published in Arabic, started in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, in 1914 and presented a variety of poetry and other literary forms. Its first editor was the well-known poet and journalist Abdul Raheem Glailati. In 1917, he was deported to Cairo by the British authorities, because of his article criticising the poor living conditions of Sudanese, but even in 1924, he could publish a collection of revolutionary, nationalist poetry. Another important factor for the development of written literature in Sudan was the spread of modern educational institutions, like the Gordon Memorial College in Khartoum and other non-religious schools in major cities like Omdurman or Wad Madani. Schooling in the English language also provided Sudanese intellectuals with access to English literature, translations from other Western languages and to non-fictional publications on world-wide issues. Apart from poetry, the most prominent literary genre in Sudan is the short story. This form of writing started in the 1920s and was largely influenced by Arabic short stories in Egyptian newspapers. Since the period preceding the independence of Sudan in 1956, short stories and novels have dealt with political and social issues, as well as with the question of the country's complex cultural identity. This central theme of what it means to be Sudanese is marked in more or lesser degrees by both African roots as well as by Arabic cultural influences.\\"The novel of the period prior to Independence dedicated itself to the search for an effective combative identity at the individual and the collective level. The post-Independence novel has attempted to grant us our profound and deeply rooted historical identity, with its negative and positive sides.\\" El-Nur Osman Abkar, The post-Independence novel: The Search for an Historical cultural identity with El Tayeb Salih and Ibrahim Ishaq, al-Ayyam newspaper (February 18, 1977), quoted after It also gave the name to a group of writers of the 1960s, comprising Al-Nur Osman Abkar, Mohammed Abdul-Hayy, Ali El-Makk or Salah Ahmed Ibrahim, called The Forest and Sahara school, where forest stands for the rainforests of the South and sahara for the deserts of Northern Sudan. A Sudanese journalist and renowned poet in the Arabic literary world was Muhammad al-Fayturi (1936‚Äì2015), whose extensive poetic work \\"particularly draws upon his experience as an African living among Arabs, and thus addresses issues such as race, class and colonialism.\\" In line with social and political developments in other countries at the time, stories, novels and poems dealing with social realist themes, like the conflicts between social classes were also written in Sudan. These were spurred on by Sudanese academics, who were returning home from studying in Egypt or in European countries. Literary critic Eiman El-Nour states that a novel by the title of \\"Al-Faragh al-'arid\\" (The vast emptiness or The wide hollowness) was the first \\"true example\\" of this type. Published in 1970, after the death of its author Malkat Ed-Dar Mohamed, the work reportedly caused quite a stir, having been written both by a woman and dealing with themes of social reality. Arguably the most notable Sudanese writer is Tayeb Salih (1929 ‚Äì 2009), who wrote both novels as well as short stories. His most famous work, translated as Season of Migration to the North and published in 1966, deals with the coming of age of a student returning to Sudan from England. It became famous among Arabic readers across the region and has subsequently been translated into several languages, including English and French. Born in Cairo of Sudanese parents in 1959, Tarek Eltayeb has been living in Vienna, Austria, since 1984. In addition to seven books in Arabic, he has published his poetry, novels and short stories in German translation. His novel Mudun Bila Nakhil (Cities Without Palms, 1992), tells the story of a young man from Sudan, who first emigrates to Egypt and further on to Europe. Another Sudanese writer of international recognition is Amir Taj al-Sir, born 1960. He has published more than a dozen books, including poetry and nonfiction. His first novel Karmakul came out in 1988, and his novel The Hunter of the Chrysalises was shortlisted for the 2011 Arabic Booker Prize. Abdelaziz Baraka Sakin (born 1963) has written several popular novels and collections of short stories, including al-Jango (2009) that deals with the conditions in a women's prison and won the al-Tayyib Salih Prize for Creative Writing. Even after having been initially sold in local bookstores, his books were confiscated and banned by the Sudanese authorities of the day and are only available outside of Sudan. His novel Masƒ´·∏• DƒÅrf≈´r (The Messiah of Darfur, 2013), taking place in the context of the civil war in Darfur, was published in French in 2016. Since 2012, Baraka Sakin has lived in exile in Austria and has been invited to a number of literary festivals in France and Germany. Stella Gaitano, born in Khartoum of parents from southern Sudan in 1979, has published both short stories and a novel in Arabic, that have been translated into English. She grew up and studied in Khartoum, and writes stories often dealing with the harsh living conditions of people from southern Sudan, who have endured discrimination and military dictatorship, or war and displacement in the northern part of Sudan. Rania Mamoun (born 1979) is another contemporary female writer, who has written novels and short stories, translated as Thirteen Months of Sunrise. Several of her stories have appeared in English translation, including in The Book of Khartoum, Banthology and in Banipal literary magazine. Sabah Sanhouri (born 1990), is a cultural essayist from Khartoum, who writes prose as well as poetry. Her story \\"Isolation\\" won the El-Tayeb Saleh competition for young writers in 2009 and was published both in Arabic, as well as in a French and English translation. Mirrors, her first collection of stories, came out in Egypt and Sudan in 2014, and in 2019, she published her first novel, entitled Paradise.  Literature in English by writers with Sudanese roots  Taban Lo Liyong, who was born in southern Sudan in 1939 and studied in the 1960s in the United States, is one of Africa's well-known poets, writers of fiction and literary criticism. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Liyong wrote highly imaginative short narratives, such as Fixions (1969), and unorthodox free verse,( ...) His nonfiction output consists of argumentative and amusing personal essays and bold literary criticism (...), presenting challenging new ideas in an original manner.\\" After teaching positions in several countries, including Sudan, he became professor of English at the University of Juba. Leila Aboulela, who was born in 1964 in Cairo, Egypt, to an Egyptian mother and a Sudanese father, and grew up in Khartoum, is a Sudanese writer who lives in Great Britain and writes in English. Her poems, short stories and novels have received international acclaim. Jamal Mahjoub, who was born in London in 1966 of British and Sudanese parents and grew up in Khartoum, writes in English and has published a trilogy taking place in Sudan. His novel A Line in the River (2019) recounts the years from the military coup of 1989 up to the separation of the North and South Sudan in 2001. In an article about literature in Sudan, written just about as the Sudanese Revolution of 2018/19 came to its final stage, he gave the following assessment of the limitations for writers, publishers and readers: A representative of young writers of Sudanese origin, living in the worldwide Sudanese diaspora, is Safia Elhillo (born 1990), a Sudanese-American poet known for her written and spoken poetry. Her poems have appeared in several publications, including Poetry, Callaloo, and the Academy of American Poets‚Äô Poem-a-day series, and in anthologies, such as The BreakBeat Poets: New American Poetry in the Age of Hip-Hop and Women of Resistance: Poems for a New Feminism. Her collection of poetry The January Children (2017) refers to the children born in Sudan under British occupation, whose birth date was often indiscriminately recorded as January 1. Emtithal Mahmoud, who was born in Darfur in 1992, moved with her parents to the United States as a child. She became known as a spoken word poet and activist for refugees. In 2015, she won the Individual World Poetry Slam championship and has since published her first collections of poems in English, entitled Sisters' Entrance. Daoud Hari, who was born as a tribesman in the Darfur region of Western Sudan, wrote an autobiographical memoir in English about life and people in Darfur, entitled The Translator: A Tribesman's Memoir of Darfur. Through his story, he tried to bring further international attention to the plight of his people and country.  Traditional and modern forms of Sudanese theatre  Rituals and theatre-like performances, such as the so- called zƒÅr rituals, have been described by modern studies as part of ancient and traditional civilisations in Sudan. During the 1930s, literary writers like Ibrahim al-Abadi (1894-1980) wrote a play about Sudanese resistance fighter against the Turkish army, El Mek Nimr, and Khaled Abu Al-Rous about a village love story called Tajouj. Along with other Sudanese or foreign plays, they were produced at the National Theatre of the time. In a period of flourishing cultural life in Sudan from the 1960s and up to the restrictions of many public activities by the Public Order Laws since 1989, foreign and Sudanese theatre plays in the modern sense enjoyed a certain amount of popularity in Khartoum. Nevertheless, the College of Music and Drama of the Sudan University of Science and Technology has been offering studies and degrees without interruption since 1977, and together with the Sudanese Dramatists Union has organized theatre festivals and workshops at the National Theatre, opened in 1959 in Omdurman.  Academic scholarship on Sudanese literature and Arabic language  An outstanding Sudanese scholar and literary critic with a long list of publications on poetry or other genres from Sudan and in Arabic in general, was Abdalla Eltayeb (1921 ‚Äì 2003). His primary field of study was the Arabic language and its creative use in poetry. One of his most notable works is A Guide to Understanding Arabic Poetry, a massive opus written over thirty-five years. Eltayeb was also president of Khartoum's Arab Language League and a member of the Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo. Through his works of fiction and radio programmes on literature, he contributed to a wider appreciation of literature for people without access to written sources. Another notable scholar on language and culture in Sudan was Awn Alsharif Qasim (1933 ‚Äì 2006). Among many other works, he authored the Sudanese Encyclopedia of Tribes and Genealogies, a pioneer, state of the art series of books about the different Sudanese tribes, their roots and origins. Several departments of the University of Khartoum, like the Faculty of Arts, the Institute of Asian and African Studies or of Islamic Studies, publish academic scholarship relating to the history and present of culture in Sudan.  Anthologies of Sudanese literature  After the 2009 collection of short stories in French translation, Nouvelles du Soudan, several anthologies in English, such as I Know Two Sudans: An Anthology of Creative Writing from Sudan and South Sudan, The Book of Khartoum, Literary Sudans: An Anthology of Literature from Sudan and South Sudan or Modern Sudanese Poetry: An Anthology have made contemporary literature from Sudan and South Sudan accessible to readers in translation. In addition, Banipal literary magazine published a special issue in 2016 on Sudanese literature today. Apart from those names already mentioned above, writers featured in these compilations are Hammour Ziada, Mohammad Jamil Ahmad, Abdel Ghani Karamallah, Najla Osman Eltom, Hamed El-Nazir, Emad Blake, Mansour El-Souwaim, Nur al-Huda Mohammed Nur al-Huda, Ahmed Al Malik, Dan Lukudu, Agnes Ponilako, Bushra Elfadil, Kenyi A. Spencer, Mamoun Eltilb and others.  Nonfiction by Sudanese writers  The list of Sudanese writers of nonfiction, as another important form of narrative writing, includes authors known for their contributions to such topics as Islamic thought, politics or social issues in Sudan. Addressing Sudanese readers, these are mainly published in Arabic, with some publications presenting essays, academic scholarship, interviews or other journalistic texts also in English. One of the Sudanese cultural online magazines, focussing on the close relationships of life in Sudan and South Sudan, as well as with other East African neighbours, is Andariya Magazine, and another online journal with a similar East African focus is The Niles.

It is a Grade I listed house and is open to public viewing. The present Palladian hall was built in 1732 for William Hanbury, Esq (1704-1768), a famous antiquarian, by Francis Smith of Warwick, to a James Gibbs design; the hall is still today surrounded by its working estate, and comprises both parkland and gardens. Pevsner described the building as, ‚Äúa perfect, extremely reticent design‚Ä¶ done in an impeccable taste.\\" In building the hall, Hanbury was utilising a fortune which had been bolstered by an advantageous marriage to a niece of Viscount Bateman; he went on to acquire the Shobdon estate in Herefordshire and one of his grandchildren, William Hanbury III, succeeded to a Bateman baronetcy. Richard Christopher Naylor, a Liverpool banker, cotton trader and horse racing enthusiast, purchased the estate in 1864, mainly for its hunting potential. In 1902, George Granville Lancaster bought the estate; his son, Claude, inherited on his majority in 1924, and later passed to Claude's elder sister Cicely in 1967; she later established the Kelmarsh Trust to safeguard the estate's future after her death in 1996. Ronald Tree and his wife Nancy, n√©e Perkins (later known as Nancy Lancaster) took a 60-year repairing lease on the Hall in 1929. Tree became the Member of Parliament for Harborough in 1933. His wife, who became renowned for her work and taste in interior design, subsequently married the owner of the Place, Colonel Lancaster.

It can be noted that the two frequences marked on the x-axis, œâp and œâs. œâp indicates the pass band cutoff frequency and œâs indicates the stop band cutoff frequency. The ripple like plot on the upper left is the pass band ripple and the ripple on the bottom right is the stop band ripple. The two dashed lines on the top left of the graph indicate the Œ¥p and the two dashed lines on the bottom right indicate the Œ¥s. All other frequencies listed indicate the extremal frequencies of the frequency response plot. As a result, there are six extremal frequencies, and then we add the pass band and stop band frequencies to give a total of eight extremal frequencies on the plot. The Parks‚ÄìMcClellan algorithm, published by James McClellan and Thomas Parks in 1972, is an iterative algorithm for finding the optimal Chebyshev finite impulse response (FIR) filter. The Parks‚ÄìMcClellan algorithm is utilized to design and implement efficient and optimal FIR filters. It uses an indirect method for finding the optimal filter coefficients. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the error in the pass and stop bands by utilizing the Chebyshev approximation. The Parks‚ÄìMcClellan algorithm is a variation of the Remez exchange algorithm, with the change that it is specifically designed for FIR filters. It has become a standard method for FIR filter design. History of optimal FIR filter design In the 1960s, researchers within the field of analog filter design were using the Chebyshev approximation for filter design. During this time, it was well known that the best filters contain an equiripple characteristic in their frequency response magnitude and the elliptic filter (or Cauer filter) was optimal with regards to the Chebyshev approximation. When the digital filter revolution began in the 1960s, researchers used a bilinear transform to produce infinite impulse response (IIR) digital elliptic filters. They also recognized the potential for designing FIR filters to accomplish the same filtering task and soon the search was on for the optimal FIR filter using the Chebyshev approximation. It was well known in both mathematics and engineering that the optimal response would exhibit an equiripple behavior and that the number of ripples could be counted using the Chebyshev approximation. Several attempts to produce a design program for the optimal Chebyshev FIR filter were undertaken in the period between 1962 and 1971. Despite the numerous attempts, most did not succeed, usually due to problems in the algorithmic implementation or problem formulation. Otto Herrmann, for example, proposed a method for designing equiripple filters with restricted band edges. This method obtained an equiripple frequency response with the maximum number of ripples by solving a set of nonlinear equations. Another method introduced at the time implemented an optimal Chebyshev approximation, but the algorithm was limited to the design of relatively low-order filters. Similar to Herrmann's method, Ed Hofstetter presented an algorithm that designed FIR filters with as many ripples as possible. This has become known as the Maximal Ripple algorithm. The Maximal Ripple algorithm imposed an alternating error condition via interpolation and then solved a set of equations that the alternating solution had to satisfy. One notable limitation of the Maximal Ripple algorithm was that the band edges were not specified as inputs to the design procedure. Rather, the initial frequency set {œâi} and the desired function D(œâi) defined the pass and stop band implicitly. Unlike previous attempts to design an optimal filter, the Maximal Ripple algorithm used an exchange method that tried to find the frequency set {œâi} where the best filter had its ripples. Thus, the Maximal Ripple algorithm was not an optimal filter design but it had quite a significant impact on how the Parks‚ÄìMcClellan algorithm would formulate. History In August 1970, James McClellan entered graduate school at Rice University with a concentration in mathematical models of analog filter design and enrolled in a new course called \\"Digital Filters\\" due to his interest in filter design. The course was taught jointly by Thomas Parks and Sid Burrus. At that time, DSP was an emerging field and as a result lectures often involved recently published research papers. The following semester, the spring of 1971, Thomas Parks offered a course called \\"Signal Theory,\\" which McClellan took as well. During spring break of the semester, Parks drove from Houston to Princeton in order to attend a conference, where he heard Ed Hofstetter's presentation about a new FIR filter design algorithm (Maximal Ripple algorithm). He brought the paper by Hofstetter, Oppenheim, and Siegel, back to Houston, thinking about the possibility of using the Chebyshev approximation theory to design FIR filters. He heard that the method implemented in Hofstetter's algorithm was similar to the Remez exchange algorithm and decided to pursue the path of using the Remez exchange algorithm. The students in the \\"Signal Theory\\" course were required to do a project and since Chebyshev approximation was a major topic in the course, the implementation of this new algorithm became James McClellan's course project. This ultimately led to the Parks‚ÄìMcClellan algorithm, which involved the theory of optimal Chebyshev approximation and an efficient implementation. By the end of the spring semester, McClellan and Parks were attempting to write a variation of the Remez exchange algorithm for FIR filters. It took about six weeks to develop and some optimal filters had been designed successfully by the end of May. James McClellan and Thomas Parks James McClellan was born on October 5, 1947, in Guam. He received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (1969) from Louisiana State University. After receiving his Master of Science (1972) and Doctorate (1973) degrees from Rice University, Dr. McClellan worked at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory from 1973 to 1975. He became a professor in the MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department in 1975. After working at the university for seven years, Dr. McClellan joined Schlumberger in 1982, where he worked for five years. Since 1987, Dr. McClellan has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr. McClellan has received numerous awards for his work in digital signal processing and its application to sensor array processing: IEEE Signal Processing Technical Achievement Award (1987), IEEE Signal Processing Society Award (1996), and IEEE Jack S. Kilby Signal Processing Medal (2004). In addition to the awards he has received, Dr. McClellan has published a number of significant pieces of literature: Computer-Based Exercises for Signal Processing Using MATLAB 5 (1994), DSP First (1997), Signal Processing First (2003), and Number Theory in DSP (1979). Thomas Parks was born on March 16, 1939, in Buffalo, New York. He received his Bachelor (1961), Master of Science (1964), and Doctorate (1967) degrees in Electrical Engineering from Cornell University. After graduating with his doctorate, Dr. Parks joined the faculty at Rice University. He was a faculty member from 1967 to 1986, when he joined the faculty at Cornell University. Dr. Parks is the recipient of multiple awards based on his research focused on digital signal processing with its application to signal theory, multirate systems, interpolation, and filter design: IEEE ASSP Society Technical Achievement Award (1981), IEEE ASSP Society Award (1988), Rice University President's Award (1999), IEEE Third Millennium Medal (2000), and IEEE Jack S. Kilby Signal Processing Medal (2004). In addition to the awards he has received, Dr. Parks has published numerous contributions to the electrical engineering field: DFT/FFT Convolution Algorithms (1985), Digital Filter Design (1987), A Digital Signal Processing Laboratory Using the TMS 32010 (1988), A Digital Signal Processing Laboratory Using the TMS 320C25 (1990), Computer-Based Exercises for Signal Processing (1994), and Computer-Based Exercises for Signal Processing Using MATLAB 5 (1994). The algorithm The Parks‚ÄìMcClellan Algorithm is implemented using the following steps: # Initialization: Choose an extremal set of frequences {œâi(0)}. # Finite Set Approximation: Calculate the best Chebyshev approximation on the present extremal set, giving a value Œ¥(m) for the min-max error on the present extremal set. # Interpolation: Calculate the error function E(œâ) over the entire set of frequencies Œ© using (2). # Look for local maxima of E(m)(œâ) on the set Œ©. # If max(œâŒµŒ©)E(m)(œâ) > Œ¥(m), then update the extremal set to {œâi(m+1)} by picking new frequencies where E(m)(œâ) has its local maxima. Make sure that the error alternates on the ordered set of frequencies as described in (4) and (5). Return to Step 2 and iterate. # If max(œâŒµŒ©)E(m)(œâ) ‚â§ Œ¥(m), then the algorithm is complete. Use the set {œâi(0)} and the interpolation formula to compute an inverse discrete Fourier transform to obtain the filter coefficients. The Parks‚ÄìMcClellan Algorithm may be restated as the following steps: # Make an initial guess of the L+2 extremal frequencies. # Compute Œ¥ using the equation given. # Using Lagrange Interpolation, we compute the dense set of samples of A(œâ) over the passband and stopband. # Determine the new L+2 largest extrema. # If the alternation theorem is not satisfied, then we go back to (2) and iterate until the alternation theorem is satisfied. # If the alternation theorem is satisfied, then we compute h(n) and we are done. To gain a basic understanding of the Parks‚ÄìMcClellan Algorithm mentioned above, we can rewrite the algorithm above in a simpler form as: # Guess the positions of the extrema are evenly spaced in the pass and stop band. # Perform polynomial interpolation and re-estimate positions of the local extrema. # Move extrema to new positions and iterate until the extrema stop shifting. Explanation The picture above on the right displays the various extremal frequencies for the plot shown. The extremal frequencies are the maximum and minimum points in the stop and pass bands. The stop band ripple is the lower portion of ripples on the bottom right of the plot and the pass band ripple is the upper portion of the ripples on the top left of the plot. The dashed lines going across the plot indicate the Œ¥ or maximum error. Given the positions of the extremal frequencies, there is a formula for the optimum Œ¥ or optimum error. Since we do not know the optimum Œ¥ or the exact positions of the extrema on the first attempt, we iterate. Effectively, we assume the positions of the extrema initially, and calculate Œ¥. We then re-estimate and move the extrema and recalculate Œ¥, or the error. We repeat this process until Œ¥ stops changing. The algorithm will cause the Œ¥ error to converge, generally within ten to twelve iterations. Additional notes Before applying the Chebyshev approximation, a set of steps were necessary: # Define the set of basis function for the approximation, and # Exploit the fact that the pass and stop bands of bandpass filters would always be separated by transition regions. Since FIR filters could be reduced to the sum of cosines case, the same core program could be used to perform all possible linear-phase FIR filters. In contrast to the Maximum Ripple approach, the band edges could now be specified ahead of time. To achieve an efficient implementation of the optimal filter design using the Parks-McClellan algorithm, two difficulties have to be overcome: # Defining a flexible exchange strategy, and # Implementing a robust interpolation method. In some sense, the programming involved the implementation and adaptation of a known algorithm for use in FIR filter design. Two faces of the exchange strategy were taken to make the program more efficient: # Allocating the extremal frequencies between the pass and stop bands, and # Enabling movement of the extremals between the bands as the program iterated. At initialization, the number of extremals in the pass and stop band could be assigned by using the ratio of the sizes of the bands. Furthermore, the pass and stop band edge would always be placed in the extremal set, and the program's logic kept those edge frequencies in the extremal set. The movement between bands was controlled by comparing the size of the errors at all the candidate extremal frequencies and taking the largest. The second element of the algorithm was the interpolation step needed to evaluate the error function. They used a method called the Barycentric form of Lagrange interpolation, which was very robust. All conditions for the Parks‚ÄìMcClellan algorithm are based on Chebyshev's alternation theorem. The alternation theorem states that the polynomial of degree L that minimizes the maximum error will have at least L+2 extrema. The optimal frequency response will barely reach the maximum ripple bounds. The extrema must occur at the pass and stop band edges and at either œâ=0 or œâ=œÄ or both. The derivative of a polynomial of degree L is a polynomial of degree L-1, which can be zero at most at L-1 places. So the maximum number of local extrema is the L-1 local extrema plus the 4 band edges, giving a total of L+3 extrema.

October 14, 1757, Grafton, Massachusetts Bay; d. May 20, 1844, Boston, Massachusetts, US)Willard Genealogy. Edited by Charles Henry Pope. Boston, MA. 1915. was an entrepreneur, an industrialist, and a designer of clocks who worked extensively at his Roxbury, Massachusetts, factory during the early years of the United States of America. While at the family farm at Grafton, Aaron Willard developed his career conjointly with his three brothers, who became celebrated horologists too (though Aaron's and his brother Simon's creations are the most significant). Both brothers moved to Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts, (where the peninsular town of Boston joined to the mainland) where they developed one of the first modern American industries, independently from each other. Simon and Aaron Willard's clocks were the first economically accessible timepieces of the country. Willard Family The first American ancestor of Willard's family was Simon Willard who arrived in 1634, together with his wife Mary Sharpe, stemming from Horsmonden, Kent, England. In America, Simon Willard became a military commander and dealt fiercely with the Indians. The Willards were among the founders of the town of Concord, Massachusetts. Later on, Simon had a prominent role throughout the region as politician and judge. A century later, Aaron Willard was of Simon's fifth New England generation. He was born in 1757, at a farm located in the hill-region of Grafton, in Worcester County, Massachusetts. Aaron Willard's parents were Benjamin Willard and Sarah Brooks. He was the third of four sons; his brothers were Benjamin, Simon, and Ephraim. =Willard Brothers= After Senior Benjamin's first steps into horology, the four brothers became horologists as well. All developed their skills at their Grafton farm and, initially, they shared time between farming chores and the new activity. All their lives were closely connected and they had strong influence reciprocally. A Pioneer American Industry Clock's signature At Boston, the two Willard brothers' chief enterprises‚ÄîSimon's and Aaron's‚Äîwere of the first American industries. Their well-organized modern workshops demanded supplies‚Äîsuch as mahogany or previously cast pieces‚Äîwhich stemmed from more than 20 manufacturers within a mile-zone. They dominated the clock-making in the Boston region. Both brothers had successful uncompromising policies in commerce, although they were permanently pledged into improving the design of their clocks too. Due to Aaron's massive production, the clock became a domesticated product for public usage, whether in parlors, offices, or the like. Nonetheless, the Willard brothers' clocks weren't affordable yet for most common people. The Willard family became quite recognizable within American high society, particularly Simon. Clock-models Although the clocks had been relatively expensive, both Willard brothers strove to compact the traditional 18th century British type of longcase clock. They simplified its action-mechanism and, for casing, they used specifically tailored wooden frames‚Äîwhich were uncomplicated for either manufacturing or assembling. Their new smaller models were relatively economic. Therefore, sales rose quickly, and the Willard brothers supplied clocks to both public and domestic consumers. Aaron Willard's models were: *Tall clock (Grandfather-Clock) *Massachusetts Shelf clock *Willard Patent Timepiece (Banjo-Clock) *Gallery Clock *Regulator clock *30-hour wall clock (Grafton timepiece) On every unit, Aaron Willard spelled his signature out, over either the dial or the glass- panel. Image:ana-004-shelfawillard.jpgAaron Willard's Shelf Clock Image:ana-005-banjoawillard.jpgAaron Willard's Lyre Clock =Tall Clock (Grandfather-Clock)= Aaron Willard began manufacturing and commercializing traditional tall case clocks (referred to as longcase clocks outside of the US). These clocks, often called Grandfather clocks today, generally stood about 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall . Although some other clockmakers produced wooden movement clocks, Willard made only clocks with brass movements. His tall case clocks were always of eight-day duration (other than extremely rare extended running clocks). The case Like Simon's, Aaron's clocks adopted a distinguishing feature early: since 1790, about their cases where, up over the dial, the case-door delineated a half circle which echoed the dial. The clocks' tops were adorned with a series of wooden curly arrangements called Whales-Tails. Later on, these ringlets evolved, and they finished extra- stretched and artistically riddled too. Many elements of brass‚Äîwhich were usually imported‚Äîsprinkled all case's woodwork. Particularly, Aaron's clocks had three spherical finials on top. However, the case presented a spate of other small brassy touches around, depending on the model. The case's door was secured by means of an iron lock. Faces The clock dials (faces) were painted iron. They were produced with varying complexity, in accord with the price of the model. For the economical, it was relatively unadorned. For the most expensive types, the dial featured artistic paintings from recognized Bostonian artists. Aaron Willard increased the value of his clocks by adding features to the dials. Most had a revolving calendar wheel, indicating the date. Many incorporated a revolving moon disc at the top of the dial for indicating the phases of the moon. In rare instances, a \\"rocking ship\\" dial was used. These were produced in Boston and are highly desirable to collectors. They are fitted with a small depiction of a sailing ship that rocks back and forth in the arch of the dial. it is driven by the motion of the pendulum. Decadence About 1812, the Napoleonic Wars altered the national economy, forcing a simplification of the most expensive models, due to cost-problems. For example, the dial-door became a conventional square, and the extra devices, which were traditionally around the dial, were simplified. =Massachusetts Shelf clock = Arriving in Roxbury, MA. about 1780, and continued to produce tall case clocks, but some time later began to produce Shelf Clocks. This model was much smaller than the tall case clocks and as a result, was suitable for being placed on a mantle, shelf or a piece of furniture. Nowadays, the Shelf-Clocks are nonetheless considered Aaron's foremost department. They are avidly sought by collectors. =Banjo clock (Willard Patent Timepiece)= Aaron Willard's third clock-model was the Banjo clock, which eventually became the factory's mainstream. The Banjo had been invented by Simon in 1802. It comprised a compacted mechanism in a compact body which could be fastened on a wall. With a not-cheap price of about $30, it was nevertheless a hit. It became the most famous clock in the early history of the United States. Daily work =Grafton= At Grafton, in Worcester County, Massachusetts, the one-room farm had been built in 1718 by Joseph Willard, who belonged to the third generation of the Willard family. The residence was further enlarged through the years. In 1776, Benjamin Willard began learning the horologist profession there, and he built a small workshop for commerce. Consequently, his knowledge was learnt also by his brothers. All did a seasonal tradeoff between farming chores and their new profession. By producing clocks for the region, the business eventually was profitable. =Roxbury (1792)= Successively, three of Willard brothers moved to Boston's Roxbury Street. Benjamin arrived in 1770. Simon arrived approximately in 1778, to the 2196-address. Aaron Willard brought his business in 1792 to the 2224-address which was a quarter of a mile from Simon's. The Boston Directory promoted Aaron's establishment as \\"Aaron Willard, clock maker on the Neck.\\" The factory's workshop functioned inside an extension which was bigger than the actual residence. Inside, the number of employees was approximately 30 during the best years. Within a radius of a quarter of a mile, 21 other important manufacturers supplied the factory in different capacities. Marriages =Catherine Gates= After his two brothers had already settled in Boston, Aaron Willard met a lady who was from nearby. Catherine Gates was from the Roxbury region, which neighbored Boston to the south, in Suffolk County. They married on March 6, 1783, in Roxbury. She was 20 years old. They had two children: Aaron Willard, Junior, on June 29, 1783, and Nancy Willard, on July 14, 1785. Catherine Gates died just days after the second birth. In time, Aaron Junior would be a renowned horologist too. =Mary Partridge= In the same decade, Aaron Willard married again, to Mary Partridge, who lived on nearby Roxbury St. She was 27 years old. The wedding took place at the Grafton farm on November 19, 1789. They had nine children: *Mary, in 1790 *Sophia and Emily, in 1792, who were twins *Catherine Gates, in 1794 *George, in 1796 *Jane J., in 1798 *Charles, in 1800 *Henry, in 1802 *Morris, in 1808 Death In 1823, Aaron Willard went into retirement. He died on May 20, 1844, at Roxbury, Suffolk, Massachusetts. He was 87 years old.Willard Genealogy. Edited by Charles Henry Pope. Boston, MA. 1915.

Origin of conspiracy theory work Giorgio wrote a novel which described how a popular Southern singer who called himself \\"Orion\\" faked his own death to escape the pressures of fame. According to Brewer-Giorgio, her publisher inexplicably began to recall her novel, which led her to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of Presley. At about the same time; an actual singer, also calling himself Orion, who sounded and looked similar to Elvis, began giving performances wearing a mask, though it was later revealed that this performer was a little-known singer named Jimmy Ellis. Brewer- Giorgio claims that his mask wearing was done without her consent, and that she had no connection with Ellis or his recordings. Orion has been released three different times and is currently out of print. The first edition has a white cover with a design on it and \\"Orion\\" written over the design. The second edition is blue with a face printed on it, showing just the eyes of a singer with a mask over it and Orion written in red.

Ya. Remez, \\"Sur la d√©termination des polyn√¥mes d'approximation de degr√© donn√©e\\", Comm. Soc. Math.

A typical example of a Chebyshev space is the subspace of Chebyshev polynomials of order n in the space of real continuous functions on an interval, C[a, b]. The polynomial of best approximation within a given subspace is defined to be the one that minimizes the maximum absolute difference between the polynomial and the function. In this case, the form of the solution is precised by the equioscillation theorem. Procedure The Remez algorithm starts with the function f to be approximated and a set X of n + 2 sample points x_1, x_2, ...,x_{n+2} in the approximation interval, usually the extrema of Chebyshev polynomial linearly mapped to the interval. The steps are: * Solve the linear system of equations : b_0 + b_1 x_i+ ... +b_n x_i ^ n + (-1)^ i E = f(x_i) (where i=1, 2, ... n+2 ), :for the unknowns b_0, b_1...b_n and E. * Use the b_i as coefficients to form a polynomial P_n. * Find the set M of points of local maximum error P_n(x) - f(x) . * If the errors at every m \\\\in M are of equal magnitude and alternate in sign, then P_n is the minimax approximation polynomial. If not, replace X with M and repeat the steps above. The result is called the polynomial of best approximation or the minimax approximation algorithm. A review of technicalities in implementing the Remez algorithm is given by W. Fraser. =On the choice of initialization= The Chebyshev nodes are a common choice for the initial approximation because of their role in the theory of polynomial interpolation. For the initialization of the optimization problem for function f by the Lagrange interpolant Ln(f), it can be shown that this initial approximation is bounded by :\\\\lVert f - L_n(f)\\\\rVert_\\\\infty \\\\le (1 + \\\\lVert L_n\\\\rVert_\\\\infty) \\\\inf_{p \\\\in P_n} \\\\lVert f - p\\\\rVert with the norm or Lebesgue constant of the Lagrange interpolation operator Ln of the nodes (t1, ..., tn + 1) being :\\\\lVert L_n\\\\rVert_\\\\infty = \\\\overline{\\\\Lambda}_n(T) = \\\\max_{-1 \\\\le x \\\\le 1} \\\\lambda_n(T; x), T being the zeros of the Chebyshev polynomials, and the Lebesgue functions being :\\\\lambda_n(T; x) = \\\\sum_{j = 1}^{n + 1} \\\\left l_j(x) \\\\right, \\\\quad l_j(x) = \\\\prod_{\\\\stackrel{i = 1}{i e j}}^{n + 1} \\\\frac{(x - t_i)}{(t_j - t_i)}.

Detailed discussion This section provides more information on the steps outlined above. In this section, the index i runs from 0 to n+1. Step 1: Given x_0, x_1, ... x_{n+1}, solve the linear system of n+2 equations : b_0 + b_1 x_i+ ... +b_n x_i ^ n + (-1) ^ i E = f(x_i) (where i=0, 1, ... n+1 ), :for the unknowns b_0, b_1, ...b_n and E. It should be clear that (-1)^i E in this equation makes sense only if the nodes x_0, ...,x_{n+1} are ordered, either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Then this linear system has a unique solution. (As is well known, not every linear system has a solution.) Also, the solution can be obtained with only O(n^2) arithmetic operations while a standard solver from the library would take O(n^3) operations. Here is the simple proof: Compute the standard n-th degree interpolant p_1(x) to f(x) at the first n+1 nodes and also the standard n-th degree interpolant p_2(x) to the ordinates (-1)^i :p_1(x_i) = f(x_i), p_2(x_i) = (-1)^i, i = 0, ..., n. To this end, use each time Newton's interpolation formula with the divided differences of order 0, ...,n and O(n^2) arithmetic operations. The polynomial p_2(x) has its i-th zero between x_{i-1} and x_i,\\\\ i=1, ...,n, and thus no further zeroes between x_n and x_{n+1}: p_2(x_n) and p_2(x_{n+1}) have the same sign (-1)^n. The linear combination p(x) := p_1 (x) - p_2(x)\\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\!E is also a polynomial of degree n and :p(x_i) = p_1(x_i) - p_2(x_i)\\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\! E \\\\ = \\\\ f(x_i) - (-1)^i E,\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ i =0, \\\\ldots, n. This is the same as the equation above for i = 0, ... ,n and for any choice of E. The same equation for i = n+1 is :p(x_{n+1}) \\\\ = \\\\ p_1(x_{n+1}) - p_2(x_{n+1})\\\\\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\!E \\\\ = \\\\ f(x_{n+1}) - (-1)^{n+1} E and needs special reasoning: solved for the variable E, it is the definition of E: :E \\\\ := \\\\ \\\\frac{p_1(x_{n+1}) - f(x_{n+1})}{p_2(x_{n+1}) + (-1)^n}. As mentioned above, the two terms in the denominator have same sign: E and thus p(x) \\\\equiv b_0 + b_1x + \\\\ldots + b_nx^n are always well-defined. The error at the given n+2 ordered nodes is positive and negative in turn because :p(x_i) - f(x_i) \\\\ = \\\\ -(-1)^i E,\\\\ \\\\ i = 0, ... , n\\\\\\\\!+\\\\\\\\!1. The theorem of de La Vall√©e Poussin states that under this condition no polynomial of degree n exists with error less than E. Indeed, if such a polynomial existed, call it \\\\tilde p(x), then the difference p(x)-\\\\tilde p(x) = (p(x) - f(x)) - (\\\\tilde p(x) - f(x)) would still be positive/negative at the n+2 nodes x_i and therefore have at least n+1 zeros which is impossible for a polynomial of degree n. Thus, this E is a lower bound for the minimum error which can be achieved with polynomials of degree n. Step 2 changes the notation from b_0 + b_1x + ... + b_nx^n to p(x). Step 3 improves upon the input nodes x_0, ..., x_{n+1} and their errors \\\\pm E as follows. In each P-region, the current node x_i is replaced with the local maximizer \\\\bar{x}_i and in each N-region x_i is replaced with the local minimizer. (Expect \\\\bar{x}_0 at A, the \\\\bar {x}_i near x_i, and \\\\bar{x}_{n+1} at B.) No high precision is required here, the standard line search with a couple of quadratic fits should suffice. (See David G. Luenberger: Introduction to Linear and Nonlinear Programming, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company 1973.) Let z_i := p(\\\\bar{x}_i) - f(\\\\bar{x}_i). Each amplitude z_i is greater than or equal to E. The Theorem of de La Vall√©e Poussin and its proof also apply to z_0, ... ,z_{n+1} with \\\\min\\\\\\\\{z_i\\\\\\\\} \\\\geq E as the new lower bound for the best error possible with polynomials of degree n. Moreover, \\\\max\\\\\\\\{z_i\\\\\\\\} comes in handy as an obvious upper bound for that best possible error. Step 4: With \\\\min\\\\,\\\\\\\\{z_i\\\\\\\\} and \\\\max\\\\,\\\\\\\\{z_i\\\\\\\\} as lower and upper bound for the best possible approximation error, one has a reliable stopping criterion: repeat the steps until \\\\max\\\\\\\\{z_i\\\\\\\\} - \\\\min\\\\\\\\{z_i\\\\\\\\} is sufficiently small or no longer decreases. These bounds indicate the progress. Variants Sometimes more than one sample point is replaced at the same time with the locations of nearby maximum absolute differences. Sometimes all of the sample points are replaced in a single iteration with the locations of all, alternating sign, maximum differences.2/73 \\"The Optimization of Bandlimited Systems\\" ‚Äì G. C. Temes, F. C. Marshall and V. Barcilon. Proceedings IEEE. Sometimes relative error is used to measure the difference between the approximation and the function, especially if the approximation will be used to compute the function on a computer which uses floating point arithmetic. Sometimes zero-error point constraints are included in a Modified Remez Exchange Algorithm.

His father was 66 when he was born. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School between 1926 and 1931 and had an outstanding school career, being appointed a Senior Prefect in his final year. He was also a notable sportsman, captaining the 1st XV rugby union side, and playing for the 1st XI cricket team. He then attended Balliol College, Oxford, following in the footsteps of his older brother Sir James Robertson. Returning to Scotland he graduated LLB at the University of Edinburgh in 1937, and served his apprenticeship as a Writer to the Signet with Shepherd and Wedderburn, but soon found his preferred field as an advocate. He regarded his life as having been transformed by meeting Anna Glen, daughter of Judge James Fulton Glen, of Tampa, Florida, United States, at her 21st birthday party at the Gleneagles Hotel. They married and had one son and two daughters, sharing 63 years together before she died in 2002. When World War II broke out Robertson joined the 8th Battalion The Royal Scots, serving first as a weapons instructor. He was later commissioned and as captain and intelligence officer for the 44th Lowland Brigade (15th Scottish Division), he distinguished himself in Normandy and NW Europe and the campaign from D-Day to the end of the war, being mentioned in dispatches. He wrote an account of the action, \\"From Normandy to the Baltic\\", printed in Germany before he returned to Britain. Career His career as an advocate was soon established. He took silk in 1954, later serving as Sheriff Principal of Ayr and Bute (1961‚Äì1966) and then of Perth and Angus (1966). In 1966 he was appointed to the High Court bench. His friend James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern said: \\"He was a meticulous, courteous and diligent judge and a great believer in the reputation of Scots Law. He was sensitive to any interference by the Executive in the work of the Courts.\\" =Notable cases= Robertson presided over the 1974 case of Jessie McTavish, a Glasgow nurse accused of the murder of one of her patients and the assault of four others. In summing up he neglected to mention her denial of a police claim that she had admitted to mercy killing during an interview. McTavish was convicted but Robertson's omission was used as the basis for an appeal the following year and McTavish's sentence was overturned.Nurse who inspired Colin Norris - Telegraph Further positions Robertson was also chairman of the Scottish Joint Council for Teachers‚Äô Salaries (1965‚Äì1981); an assessor on University of Edinburgh Court (1967‚Äì1981); chairman of the Edinburgh Centre for Rural Economy (1967‚Äì1985); chairman of the Centre of Tropical Veterinary Medicine; and chairman of the Scottish Valuation Advisory Council (1977‚Äì1986). The first Scottish judge to be a member of the International Union of Judges, he served for 13 years (1974‚Äì1987). He was on the board of governors of Merchiston Castle School 1954-2005 and was chairman 1970-1996. Robertson also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1988 He played golf into his eighties, particularly at Muirfield where he was captain from 1970 to 1972.

Yesterday Was a Lie was released theatrically in the U.S. on December 11, 2009. Home video The film was released on DVD on April 6, 2010.  Reception  In a review published after the film's U.S. theatrical opening, Variety praised the film's \\"stunning black-and-white HD cinematography\\" and \\"impressively atmospheric tone\\" and its recreation of the \\"classical Hollywood [visual] aesthetic\\". The film's \\"sultry jazz score\\" was also singled out for mention. However, the review also criticized the casting of the film‚Äîcalling the acting \\"stiff\\" and \\"hopelessly amateurish\\"‚Äîas well as the plot, which it described as a \\"clunky David Lynchian cosmic mystery\\" leading to \\"grand (yet underwhelming) revelations about the nature of reality.\\"Debruge, Peter. \\"Yesterday Was a Lie\\" at Variety.com (December 16, 2009).

Micro theatrical release will come and > go unnoticed, though niche auds may find it on DVD. Other mainstream reviewers were critical of the film as well. Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"The film seems like an atmospheric shampoo commercial in which glamorous models pose in gritty back alleys with fog machines going full force. ... There's lots of talk about the 'interconnected of consciousness' and 'the totality of consciousness' and how those who can plug into it can control reality ... [The] film is hard to connect with and is way too vague to inspire the urge to try to do so.\\"Thomas, Kevin. \\"'Yesterday' looks noir, lacks depth\\" Los Angeles Times, (December 11, 2009) while John Wheeler in LA Weekly wrote that the film's \\"pitch\\" was \\"'a metaphysical noir about a beautiful alcoholic detective searching for the key to understanding nonlinear time'\\" but commented that the \\"film can't hope to live up to that premise, and it doesn't.\\" It comments that \\"the film jumps around aimlessly, repeating dialogue and images of Hoyle's search while using non sequitur discussions of Dal√≠ and Eliot to justify its often impenetrably surreal structure.\\" It praises the film as being in \\"gorgeous black-and-white and lit by some extremely competent artisans\\" but concludes that \\"the film is finally too disjointed and incomprehensible to be enjoyed as much else besides an exercise in style.\\"Wheeler, John \\"Movie Reviews: Broken Embraces, Paa, A Single Man, Armored\\", LA Weekly (December 10, 2009) The Epoch Times newspaper, Collider.com, Ain't It Cool, and KGO resident film critic Dennis Willis all reviewed the film positively, with Willis calling Yesterday \\"nothing less than the arrival of a major filmmaker.\\"Willis, Dennis.

Originally a Turkic slave-soldier, in 868 Ibn Tulun was sent to Egypt as governor by the Abbasid caliph. Within four years Ibn Tulun had established himself as a virtually independent ruler by evicting the caliphal fiscal agent, Ibn al- Mudabbir, taking over control of Egypt's finances, and establishing a large military force personally loyal to himself. This process was facilitated by the volatile political situation in the Abbasid court and the preoccupation of the Abbasid regent, al-Muwaffaq, with the wars against the Saffarids and the Zanj Rebellion. Ibn Tulun also took care to establish an efficient administration in Egypt. After reforms to the tax system, repairs to the irrigation system, and other measures, the annual tax yield grew markedly. As a symbol of his new regime, he built a new capital, al-Qata'i, north of the old capital Fustat. After 875/6 he entered into open conflict with al- Muwaffaq, who tried unsuccessfully to unseat him. In 878, with the support of al-Muwaffaq's brother, Caliph al-Mu'tamid, Ibn Tulun took over the governance of Syria as well as the frontier districts with the Byzantine Empire, although control of Tarsus in particular proved tenuous. During his absence in Syria, his eldest son and deputy, Abbas, tried to usurp power in Egypt, leading to the imprisonment of Abbas and the nomination of Ibn Tulun's second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir. The defection in 882 of a senior commander, Lu'lu', to al-Muwaffaq, and the defection of Tarsus, forced Ibn Tulun to return to Syria. Now virtually powerless, al-Mu'tamid tried to escape from his brother's control to Ibn Tulun's domains but was captured by al-Muwaffaq's agents, and Ibn Tulun convened an assembly of jurists at Damascus to denounce al-Muwaffaq as a usurper. His attempt in autumn 883 to bring Tarsus to heel failed, and he fell sick. Returning to Egypt, he died in May 884 and was succeeded by Khumarawayh. Ibn Tulun stands out as the first governor of a major province of the Abbasid Caliphate to not only establish himself as its master independently of the Abbasid court, but to also pass power on to his son. He was thus also the first ruler since the Ptolemaic Pharaohs to make Egypt an independent political power again, with a sphere of influence encompassing Syria and parts of the Maghreb, setting the tone for later Egypt-based Islamic regimes, from the Ikhshidids to the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo. Primary sources Several medieval authors wrote about Ahmad ibn Tulun. The two major sources are two biographies by two 10th-century authors, Ibn al-Daya and al- Balawi. Both are called Sirat Ahmad ibn Tulun, and al-Balawi's work relies to a large extent on Ibn al-Daya's, although it is much more extensive. Ibn al- Daya also wrote a book (Kitab al-mukafa'a) with anecdotes from the Tulunid-era Egyptian society. Further information comes from Ibn Tulun's contemporary, the geographer and traveler Ya'qubi, whose works cover the first years of his rule in Egypt, and from later Egyptian authors, especially the 15th-century historians Ibn Duqmaq and al-Maqrizi, who drew on a variety of earlier sources to write on the history of the Tulunid state. Several other medieval Arabic chroniclers from the 13th to the 16th centuries mention Ibn Tulun or his officials, but most are of a later date and not very reliable, especially in comparison to Ibn Duqmaq and al-Maqrizi.See also on modern scholarship regarding Ibn Tulun and his works. Life =Early life and career= Ahmad ibn Tulun was born on the 23rd day of the month of Ramadan 220 AH (20 September 835) or slightly later, probably in Baghdad. His father, Tulun, was a Turk from a locality known in Arabic sources as Tagharghar or Toghuz[o]ghuz --i.e., the Uyghur confederation. In the year 815/6 (200 AH) Tulun was taken captive along with other Turks, and sent as part of the tribute of the Samanid governor of Bukhara Nuh ibn Asad to the Caliph al-Ma'mun (reigned 813‚Äì833), who at the time resided in Khurasan. After al-Ma'mun returned to Baghdad in 819, these Turkish slaves were formed into a guard corps of slave soldiers (ghilmƒÅn, sing. ghulƒÅm) entrusted to al-Ma'mun's brother and eventual successor, al-Mu'tasim (r. 833‚Äì842). Tulun did well for himself, eventually coming to command the Caliph's private guard. Ahmad's mother, called Qasim, was one of his father's slaves. In 854/5, Tulun died, and Qasim is commonly held to have married a second time, to the Turkish general Bayakbak or Bakbak. This report, however, does not appear in Ibn al-Daya or al-Balawi, and may be spurious. According to al-Balawi, after his father's death Ahmad came under the tutelage of Yalbakh, a close companion of Tulun, who had been taken captive alongside him. At his deathbed, Tulun urged his friend to take care of his wife and son, and Bakbak thereafter treated the young Ahmad as his own son. The young Ahmad ibn Tulun received a thorough education, involving military training at the new Abbasid capital of Samarra and studies in Islamic theology at Tarsus, acquiring a reputation not only for his knowledge but also for his pious and ascetic way of life. He became popular among his fellow Turks, who would confide secrets and entrust their money and even their women to him. While at Tarsus, Ibn Tulun fought in the frontier wars with the Byzantine Empire. There he also met another senior Turkish leader, Yarjukh, whose daughter, variously given as Majur or Khatun, became his first wife and the mother of his eldest son, Abbas, and his daughter Fatimah. The sources also report that during his time at Tarsus, Ibn Tulun had ties to Caliph al- Mutawakkil's vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan, and the latter's cousin Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khaqan. On one occasion, while returning to Samarra, he saved a caravan bearing a caliphal envoy returning from Constantinople from a Bedouin raiding party, and accompanied it to Samarra. This act gained him the favour of Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862‚Äì866), as well as a thousand gold dinars and the hand of the slave Miyas, the mother of his second son, Khumarawayh. When the Caliph abdicated and went into exile at Wasit in 866, he chose Ibn Tulun to be his guard. Qubayha, the mother of the new caliph, al-Mu'tazz (r. 866‚Äì869), schemed to remove the deposed al-Musta'in, and offered Ibn Tulun the governorship of Wasit if he would murder him. Ibn Tulun refused and was replaced by another, who carried out the deed. Ibn Tulun himself played no part in the assassination, but gave his master a burial and returned to Samarra. =Governor of Egypt= Spiral Minaret of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo Already under Caliph al-Mu'tasim, senior Turkish leaders began being appointed as governors of provinces of the Caliphate as a form of appanage. Thereby they secured immediate access to the province's tax revenue for themselves and their troops, bypassing the civilian bureaucracy. The Turkish generals usually remained close to the centre of power in Samarra, sending deputies to govern in their name. Thus when al-Mu'tazz gave Bakbak charge of Egypt in 868, Bakbak in turn sent his stepson Ahmad as his lieutenant and resident governor. Ahmad ibn Tulun entered Egypt on 27 August 868, and the Egyptian capital, Fustat, on 15 September. Ibn Tulun's position after his appointment was far from undisputed within his province. As governor of Fustat he oversaw the province's garrison and was the head of the Muslim community as recognized in his title of \\"overseer of the army and the Friday prayer\\" (wƒÅli al-jaysh wa æl-·π£alƒÅt), but the fiscal administration, in particular the collection of the land tax (kharƒÅj) was in the hands of the powerful veteran administrator Ibn al-Mudabbir. The latter had been appointed as fiscal agent ( øƒÅmil) already since ca. 861, and had rapidly become the most hated man in the country as he doubled the taxes and imposed new ones on Muslims and non- Muslims alike. Ibn Tulun quickly signalled his intention to be sole master of his province: on his arrival at Fustat, when both Ibn al-Mudabbir and Shukayr, the head of the postal service (barƒ´d) and of correspondence with the caliphal government, came out to meet him with a gift of 10,000 dinars, he refused to accept it. For the next four years, Ibn Tulun and his rivals fought via their emissaries and relatives at the caliphal court in Samarra to neutralize each other; in the end, Ibn Tulun managed to secure Ibn al-Mudabbir's transfer to Syria in July 871, and assumed collection of the kharƒÅj himself. At the same time, Ibn Tulun also secured the dismissal of Shukayr, who died shortly after. Thus by 872 Ibn Tulun had assumed control of all branches of the administration in Egypt, becoming de facto independent of the Abbasid central government. At the time of Ibn Tulun's appointment, Egypt was undergoing a transformative process. In 834 its early Muslim elite, the Arab settler families (jund) of Fustat, lost their privileges and government pay, and power passed to officials sent by the Abbasid court. At about the same time, for the first time the Muslim population began surpassing the Coptic Christians in numbers, and the rural districts were increasingly subject to both Arabization and Islamization. The rapidity of this process, and the influx of settlers after the discovery of gold and emerald mines at Aswan, meant that Upper Egypt in particular was only superficially controlled by the local governor. Furthermore, the persistence of internecine strife and turmoil at the heart of the Abbasid state‚Äîthe so-called \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\"‚Äîled to the appearance of millennialist revolutionary movements in the province under a series of Alid pretenders. One of them was Ibn al-Sufi, a descendant of Ali's son Umar, who rebelled in late 869 and massacred the populace of Esna. In winter 870 he defeated an army sent against him by Ibn Tulun, but was driven to the oases of the desert in spring. He remained there until he was defeated in a struggle with another regional strongman, Abu Abdallah ibn Abd al-Hamid al-Umari in 872, fleeing to Mecca. There he was seized and imprisoned for a while by Ibn Tulun. One of his followers, Abu Ruh Sukun, rebelled in the oases in 873/4 and was successful enough for Ibn Tulun to offer him an amnesty. Ibn al-Sufi's vanquisher, al-Umari, was another descendant of Ali who had created an autonomous principality around the gold mines, defeating the forces sent against him. Another revolt broke out in 874/5 by the governor of Barqa, Muhammad ibn al-Faraj al-Farghani. Ibn Tulun tried to reconcile with him at first but was eventually forced to send an army to besiege and storm the city, although the reprisals were limited. The re-imposition of his authority over Barqa, however, led to the strengthening of ties with Ifriqiya to the west, including, according to Ibn al-Athir, the erection of a series of lighthouses and messaging beacons along the coast. In the meantime, in Palestine, the local governor, Isa ibn al-Shaykh al-Shaybani, had used the anarchy in Iraq to set up a quasi-independent Bedouin regime, intercepting the tax caravans from Egypt and threatening Damascus. When Caliph al-Muhtadi ascended the throne in July 869, he offered a general amnesty, and wrote to Ibn al-Shaykh, offering a pardon in exchange for him handing over the treasure he had wrongfully appropriated. When Ibn al-Shaykh refused, the Caliph ordered Ibn Tulun to march against him. Ibn Tulun complied and began a mass purchase of black African (SudƒÅn) and Greek (R≈´m) slaves to form an army over the winter of 869/70, but no sooner had he arrived at al-Arish with his army in summer 870 than orders came to turn back. Ibn al-Shaykh's revolt was crushed soon after by another Turkish soldier, Amajur al-Turki, who continued to govern Syria for the Abbasids until his death in 878. This episode was nevertheless of major importance as it allowed Ibn Tulun to recruit an army of his own with caliphal sanction. The Tulunid army, which eventually grew to reportedly 100,000 men‚Äîother sources give a breakdown of 24,000 Turkish ghilmƒÅn and 42,000 black African and Greek slaves, as well as a mercenary corps composed mostly of Greeks‚Äîbecame the foundation of Ibn Tulun's power and independence. For his personal protection, Ibn Tulun reportedly employed a corps of ghilmƒÅn from Ghur. Ibn Tulun's stepfather Bakbak was murdered in 869/70, but luckily for him in the summer of 871 the supervision of Egypt passed to his father-in-law Yarjukh. Yarjukh not only confirmed Ibn Tulun in his post, but in addition conferred to him the authority over Alexandria and Barqa. In 873, Ibn Tulun entrusted the government of Alexandria to his eldest son, Abbas. Ibn Tulun's growing power was manifested in the establishment of a new palace city to the northeast of Fustat, called al-Qata'i, in 870. The project was a conscious emulation of, and rival to, the Abbasid capital Samarra. Just like Samarra, the new city was designed as quarters for Ibn Tulun's new army with the aim of reducing frictions with the urban populace of Fustat. Each unit received an allotment or ward (whence the city's name) to settle, after which the ward was named. The new city's centrepiece was the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, which was built in 878‚Äì880 under the supervision of the Mesopotamian Christian architect Ibn Katib al-Farghani. A royal palace adjoined the mosque, and the rest of the city was laid out around them. Beside government buildings, it included markets, a hospital (al-bimƒÅristƒÅn) that provided services free of charge, and a hippodrome. Nevertheless, Ibn Tulun himself preferred to reside in the Coptic monastery of Qusayr outside Fustat. =Ibn Tulun's new regime= The administration of Egypt was already well developed before Ibn Tulun's arrival, with a number of departments (dƒ´wƒÅns) responsible for the collection of the land tax, the supervision of the post, the public granaries (dƒ´wƒÅn al-ahrƒÅ ø), the Nile Delta lands (dƒ´wƒÅn asfal al-ar·∏ç), and possibly a privy purse (dƒ´wƒÅn al-kha·π£·π£) for the governor's personal use. A chancery (dƒ´wƒÅn al-inshƒÅ æ) possibly also already existed, or else was established under Ibn Tulun, when he remodelled the Egyptian administration after the Abbasid central government. Most of the officials employed by Ibn Tulun were like him trained in the caliphal court at Samarra. Ibn Tulun's chancellor was the capable Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Abd al-Kan (died 891), while other important positions in the administration were held by the four Banu al-Muhajir brothers and Ibn al- Daya. Al-Balawi also reports several anecdotes about Ibn Tulun's extensive use of spies and his own ability to uncover spies sent against him, and claims that the chancery was established so that Ibn Tulun could check up on every piece of correspondence with the caliphal court. Unsurprisingly, given his own origins as a slave soldier, Ibn Tulun's regime was in many ways typical of the \\"ghulƒÅm system\\" that became one of the two main paradigms of Islamic polities in the 9th and 10th centuries, as the Abbasid Caliphate fragmented and new dynasties emerged. These regimes were based on the power of a regular army composed of ghilmƒÅn, but in turn, according to Hugh N. Kennedy, \\"the paying of the troops was the major preoccupation of government\\". It is therefore in the context of the increased financial requirements that in 879, the supervision of the finances in Egypt and Syria passed to Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al- Madhara'i, the founder of the al-Madhara'i bureaucratic dynasty that dominated the fiscal apparatus of Egypt for the next 70 years. Although, as Zaky M. Hassan notes, \\"fragmentary evidence does not permit a thorough assessment of Tulunid economic and financial policies\\", it appears that the peace and security provided by the Tulunid regime, the establishment of an efficient administration, and repairs and expansions to the irrigation system, coupled with a consistently high level of Nile floods, resulted in a major increase in revenue. By the time of Ibn Tulun's death, income from the land tax alone had risen from 800,000 dinars under Ibn al-Mudabbir to the sum of 4.3 million dinars, and Ibn Tulun bequeathed his successor a fiscal reserve of ten million dinars. Crucial to this was the reform of the tax assessment and collection system, including the introduction of tax farming‚Äîwhich at the same time led to the rise of a new landholding class. Additional revenue was collected from commercial activities, most notably textiles and in particular linen. Ibn Tulun's regime was highly centralized, but also featured \\"consistent attempts to win the backing of Egypt's commercial, religious and social √©lite\\", according to Zaky M. Hassan. Notably, the wealthy merchant Ma'mar al-Jawhar functioned both as Ibn Tulun's personal financier and as the head of an informal intelligence network through his contacts in Iraq. A further \\"notable characteristic\\" of Ibn Tulun's rule, according to historian Thierry Bianquis, was \\"the quality of relations it maintained with Christians and Jews\\"; according to a letter by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Elias III, when he took over Palestine, he appointed a Christian as governor of Jerusalem, and possibly even of the provincial capital, Ramla, thereby putting an end to the persecution of Christians and allowing the renovation of churches. =Expansion into Syria= Map of the Tulunid domains following the conquest of Syria, In the early 870s, a major change took place in the Abbasid government, as the Abbasid prince al-Muwaffaq emerged as the de facto regent of the empire, sidelining his brother, Caliph al-Mu'tamid (r. 870‚Äì892). Officially, al-Muwaffaq controlled the eastern half of the Caliphate, while al-Mu'tamid's son and first heir al-Mufawwad controlled the western, with the aid of the Turkish general Musa ibn Bugha. In reality al-Muwaffaq held the actual reins of power. Al-Muwaffaq however was preoccupied with the more immediate threats to the Abbasid government presented by the rise of the Saffarids in the east and by the Zanj Rebellion in Iraq itself, as well as with keeping in check the Turkish troops and managing the internal tensions of the caliphal government. This gave Ibn Tulun the necessary space to consolidate his own position in Egypt. Ibn Tulun kept himself out of the Zanj conflict, and even refused to recognize al-Mufawwad as his suzerain, who in turn did not confirm him in his position. Open conflict between Ibn Tulun and al-Muwaffaq broke out in 875/6, on the occasion of a large remittance of revenue to the central government. Counting on the rivalry between the Caliph and his over-mighty brother to maintain his own position, Ibn Tulun forwarded a larger share of the taxes to al-Mu'tamid instead of al-Muwaffaq: 2.2 million dinars went to the Caliph and only 1.2 million dinars to his brother. Al- Muwaffaq, who in his fight against the Zanj considered himself entitled to the major share of the provincial revenues, was angered by this, and by the implied machinations between Ibn Tulun and his brother. Al-Muwaffaq sought a volunteer to replace him, but all the officials in Baghdad had been bought off by Ibn Tulun and refused. Al-Muwaffaq sent a letter to the Egyptian ruler demanding his resignation, which the latter predictably refused. Both sides geared for war. Ibn Tulun created a fleet and fortified his borders and ports, including Alexandria, and a new fortress on Rawda Island to protect Fustat. Al-Muwaffaq nominated Musa ibn Bugha as governor of Egypt and sent him with troops to Syria. In the event, due to a combination of lack of pay and supplies for the troops, and the fear generated by Ibn Tulun's army, Musa never got further than Raqqa. After ten months of inaction and a rebellion by his troops, Musa returned to Iraq. In a public gesture of support for al- Mu'tamid and opposition to al-Muwaffaq, Ibn Tulun would assume the title of \\"Servant of the Commander of the Faithful\\" (mawlƒÅ amƒ´r al-mu æminƒ´n) in 878. Ibn Tulun now seized the initiative. Having served in his youth in the border wars with the Byzantine Empire at Tarsus, he now requested to be conferred the command of the frontier districts of Cilicia (the Thugh≈´r). Al-Muwaffaq initially refused, but following the Byzantine successes of the previous years al-Mu'tamid prevailed upon his brother and in 877/8 Ibn Tulun received responsibility for the entirety of Syria and the Cilician frontier. Ibn Tulun marched into Syria in person. He received the submission of the son of Amajur, who had recently died, whom he appointed governor at Ramla, and proceeded to take possession of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo. At Damascus Ibn Tulun encountered his old rival Ibn al-Mudabbir, who since his eviction from Egypt had served as Amajur's  øƒÅmil for Palestine and Damascus. Ibn al-Mudabbir was fined 600,000 dinars and thrown into prison, where he died in 883/4. In the rest of the provincial administration, however, he largely left the people who had served under Amajur in place. Only the governor of Aleppo, Sima al-Tawil, resisted, and fled to Antioch. Ibn Tulun laid siege to the city until Sima was killed, reportedly by a local woman. He then continued on to Tarsus, where he began preparing for a campaign against the Byzantines. The presence of his numerous soldiers, however, led to a rapid rise in prices, causing great hostility among the Tarsians, who demanded that he either leave or reduce his army. At this juncture, news arrived from Egypt that his son Abbas, whom he had left as his regent, was preparing to usurp his position under the influence of his entourage. Ibn Tulun hastily withdrew from Tarsus, but as more information about the situation in Egypt began to arrive, clarifying that Abbas posed no real threat, Ibn Tulun decided to spend more time in Syria and consolidate his authority. He redressed the injustices of Sima, installed troops in Aleppo (under his ghulam Lu'lu') and Harran, secured the co- operation of the Banu Kilab tribe and their leader Ibn al-Abbas, and captured the rebel Musa ibn Atamish. At some point after his takeover of Syria, Ibn Tulun ordered the refortification of Akka, a task undertaken by Abu Bakr al- Banna, the grandfather of al-Muqaddasi, who provides a detailed description of the work. Only then, in April 879, did Ibn Tulun return to Egypt. Abbas fled west with his supporters, and from Barqa tried to take over Ifriqiya. Defeated by the Ifriqiyans (probably in the winter of 880‚Äì881), he retreated back east to Alexandria, where he was finally confronted and captured by Ibn Tulun's forces. After being publicly paraded seated on a mule, Ibn Tulun ordered his son to execute or mutilate his companions, who had driven him to rebel. Ibn Tulun reportedly secretly hoped that his son would refuse to do such a dishonourable act, but he agreed. Weeping, Ibn Tulun had Abbas whipped and imprisoned. He then named his second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir-apparent. =Final years and death= Gold dinar of Ahmad ibn Tulun minted in Fustat in 881/2 Following his return from Syria, Ibn Tulun added his own name to coins issued by the mints under his control, along with those of the Caliph and heir apparent, al-Mufawwad. In the autumn of 882, the Tulunid general Lu'lu' defected to the Abbasids. At the same time, the Tulunid-appointed governor of Tarsus and the Thugh≈´r died, and his replacement, Yazaman al-Khadim, with popular backing, refused to acknowledge Tulunid rule. Ibn Tulun immediately left in person for Syria‚Äîtaking the chained Abbas with him as a precaution‚Äîand headed for Tarsus. At Damascus, he received a message from al-Mu'tamid informing him that the by-now nearly powerless Caliph had escaped Samarra and was heading for Syria. Taking custody of al-Mu'tamid would have immensely boosted Ibn Tulun's standing: not only would the sole source of political legitimacy in the Muslim world reside under his control, but he would also be able to pose as the \\"rescuer\\" of the Caliph. Ibn Tulun therefore decided to halt and await al-Mu'tamid's arrival. In the event, however, the Caliph was overtaken at al-Haditha on the Euphrates by the governor of Mosul, Ishaq ibn Kundaj, who defeated the caliphal escort and brought him back to Samarra (February 883) and thence south to Wasit, where al-Muwaffaq could better control him. This opened anew the rift between the two rulers: al-Muwaffaq nominated Ishaq ibn Kundaj as governor of Egypt and Syria‚Äîin reality a largely symbolic appointment‚Äîwhile Ibn Tulun organized an assembly of religious jurists at Damascus which denounced al-Muwaffaq as a usurper, condemned his maltreatment of the Caliph, declared his place in the succession as void, and called for a jihƒÅd against him. Only three participants, including the chief qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ of Egypt, Bakkar ibn Qutayba, refused to pronounce the call for jihƒÅd publicly. Ibn Tulun had his rival duly denounced in sermons in the mosques across the Tulunid domains, while the Abbasid regent responded in kind with a ritual denunciation of Ibn Tulun. Despite the belligerent rhetoric, however, neither made moves to confront the other militarily. After his failure to take control of the Caliph, Ibn Tulun turned on Tarsus. He appointed Abdallah ibn Fath in Lu'lu's place in Aleppo, and marched in person to Cilicia. The Egyptian ruler laid siege to Tarsus in autumn 883, but Yazaman diverted the local river, inundating the Tulunid camp and forcing Ibn Tulun to retreat. Ibn Tulun fell ill on his return to Egypt, and was carried to Fustat on a wheeled vehicle. In the same year, a campaign to take over the two holy cities of Islam, Mecca and Medina, also failed. Back in Egypt, he ordered Bakkar to be arrested and replaced him with Muhammad ibn Shadhan al-Jawhari. A thorough examination of Bakkar's accounts while head of the charitable endowments, however, revealed no misappropriations. Although Ibn Tulun ordered him released, the elderly and sick qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ refused to leave his cell. At the same time, the illness of Ibn Tulun himself worsened. \\"Muslims, Christians and Jews, including women and children, converged separately upon the flank of the Muqattam to implore God to save him\\", as Bianquis writes, but Ibn Tulun died at Fustat on 10 May 884 and was interred on the slopes of the Muqattam. According to al-Balawi, Ibn Tulun left his heir 24,000 servants, 7,000 men and 7,000 horses, 3,000 camels, 1,000 mules, 350 ceremonial horses, and 200 fully equipped warships. At Ibn Tulun's death, Khumarawayh, with the backing of the Tulunid elites, succeeded without opposition. Ibn Tulun bequeathed his heir \\"with a seasoned military, a stable economy, and a coterie of experienced commanders and bureaucrats\\". Khumarawayh was able to preserve his authority against the Abbasid attempt to overthrow him at the Battle of Tawahin and even made additional territorial gains, but his extravagant spending exhausted the treasury, and his assassination in 896 began the rapid decline of the Tulunid regime. Internal strife sapped Tulunid power. Khumarawayh's son Jaysh was a drunkard who executed his uncle, Mudar ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun; he was deposed after only a few months and replaced by his brother Harun ibn Khumarawayh. Harun too was a weak ruler, and although a revolt by his uncle Rabi'ah in Alexandria was suppressed, the Tulunids were unable to confront the attacks of the Qarmatians which began at the same time. In addition, many commanders defected to the Abbasids, whose power revived under the capable leadership of al-Muwaffaq's son, Caliph al-Mu'tadid (r. 892‚Äì902). Finally, in December 904, two other sons of Ibn Tulun, Ali and Shayban, murdered their nephew and assumed control of the Tulunid state. Far from halting the decline, this event alienated key commanders in Syria and led to the rapid and relatively unopposed reconquest of Syria and Egypt by the Abbasids under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, who entered Fustat in January 905. With the exception of the great Mosque of Ibn Tulun, the victorious Abbasid troops pillaged al- Qata'i and razed it. =Offspring= According to al-Balawi, from his various wives and concubines, Ibn Tulun had 33 children, 17 sons and 16 daughters. The only modern edition of al-Balawi provides the following list: * Male children: Ab≈´ al-Fa·∏çl al- øAbbƒÅs (the eldest), Ab≈´ al-Jaysh KhumƒÅrawayh, Ab≈´ al-AshƒÅ æir Mu·∏çar, Ab≈´ al-Mukarram Rabƒ´ øah, Ab≈´ al-MaqƒÅnib ShaybƒÅn, Ab≈´ NƒÅhi·∏ç 'IyƒÅ·∏ç, Ab≈´ Ma ød  øAdnƒÅn, Ab≈´ al-KarƒÅdƒ´s Kazraj, Ab≈´ ·∏§absh≈´n  øAdƒ´, Ab≈´ ShujƒÅ ø Kindah, Ab≈´ Man·π£≈´r Aghlab, Ab≈´ Lahjah Maysarah, Ab≈´ al-BaqƒÅ æ HudƒÅ, Ab≈´ al-Mufawwa·∏ç GhassƒÅn, Ab≈´ al-Faraj MubƒÅrak, Ab≈´  øAbdallƒÅh Muhammad, and Ab≈´ al-Fataj Mu·∫ìaffar. * Female children (note that only 15 names are listed): FƒÅ·π≠imah, Lamƒ´s, (unreadable), ·π¢afiyyah, Khadƒ´jah, Maym≈´nah, Maryam,  øƒÄ æishah, Umm al- HudƒÅ, Mu æminah,  øAzƒ´zah, Zaynab, SamƒÅnah, SƒÅrah, and Ghurayrah. Legacy Map of the fragmented Abbasid empire, with areas still under direct control of the Abbasid central government (dark green) and under autonomous rulers (light green) adhering to nominal Abbasid suzerainty, Despite the brief duration of his dynasty, Ibn Tulun's rule was a seminal event not only for Egypt, but for the entire Islamic world. For Egypt itself, his reign marks a turning point as the country for the first time since the Pharaohs ceased being a passive province subject to a foreign imperial power, and became once again a political actor in its own right. The new realm Ibn Tulun forged, encompassing Egypt and Syria as well as the Jazira and Cilicia, and to a lesser extent the eastern parts of the Maghreb, established a new political zone separated from the Islamic lands further east, restoring in a fashion the frontier that had existed between the Roman/Byzantine and Sassanid Persian realms in Antiquity. Egypt was the basis of Ibn Tulun's power; he paid particular attention to restoring its economy, as well as establishing an autonomous bureaucracy, army, and navy. These policies were continued by later Egypt-based regimes, the Ikhshidids (935‚Äì969) and eventually the Fatimids (969‚Äì1171), who likewise used Egypt's wealth to establish control over parts or even most of Syria. Indeed, as Thierry Bianquis remarks, the territory ruled by Ibn Tulun in Syria was remarkably similar to that controlled by the later Egypt-based regimes of Saladin and the Mamluk Sultanate. According to the historian Matthew Gordon, Ibn Tulun's relations with, and quest for autonomy from, the Abbasids is a \\"central problem of Tulunid history\\". Modern scholars see in Ibn Tulun's policies a \\"careful balancing act\\" and notice that he never fully severed himself from the Caliphate, remaining conspicuously loyal to the person of al- Mu'tamid, who, after all, was a powerless figurehead. Nevertheless, the move towards increasing autonomy is evident throughout his reign. His relations with the Abbasid government were dominated by his conflict with al-Muwaffaq, resulting from the latter's attempts to establish control over Egypt‚Äîwhose wealth was direly needed during the costly war against the Zanj‚Äîand prevent the further rise of Ibn Tulun. In a certain sense, writes Matthew Gordon, many of Ibn Tulun's measures \\"were as much the means by which imperial interests were protected against the ambitions of al-Muwaffaq and his (largely Turkish) military coterie in Iraq as they were efforts to secure Tulunid authority\\". Given that Ibn Tulun at least twice (in 871 and 875/6) remitted huge sums to the caliphal treasury, it remains an open question whether without the conflict with al-Muwaffaq, this would have been a more regular occurrence. Nevertheless, in retrospective, Ibn Tulun's role in the wider context of Islamic history is as the herald of the Abbasid Caliphate's disintegration and the rise of local dynasties in the provinces. This became particularly evident with the succession of Khumarawayh: as Thierry Bianquis explains, \\"this was the first time in Abbasid history with regard to the government of so large and rich a territory, that a wƒÅli, whose legitimacy derived from the caliph who had designated him, was succeeded openly by an amƒ´r who claimed his legitimacy by inheritance\\". Thus Zaky M. Hassan calls Ibn Tulun a \\"typical example of the Turkish slaves who from the time of Harun al-Rashid were enlisted in the private service of the caliph and the principal officers of state, and whose ambition and spirit of intrigue and independence [eventually made] them the real masters of Islam\\".

Accessed March 24, 2016. More than a decade after its publication, according to an article in the University of Chicago Law Review: \\"As had never been done before, Actual Innocence presented story after story of wrongful convictions (and near executions) of the indisputably innocent, with each chapter devoted to exposing each of these flaws in the justice system. Actual Innocence was nothing short of a revelation, a wake-up call concerning the reality of wrongful convictions and the truth-telling power of DNA evidence. It was not merely descriptive; it was also prescriptive, setting out a lengthy recipe of reforms needed to prevent future wrongful convictions.\\" Dwyer was the co- author of Two Seconds Under the World (1994), an account of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center that explored the early signs of fundamentalist terrorism, and poor coordination by investigating agencies, including the FBI. =Subway Lives= Dwyer is the author of Subway Lives: 24 Hours in the Life of the New York Subways (1991), which the critic Jonathan Yardley said was \\"as good a book about New York as you could hope to find.\\" It follows the lives of six New Yorkers and is set on the day the last graffiti-covered train was in service. Writing in The Washington Post, Yardley commented: \\"Subway Lives is a book that not merely tells you everything you secretly wanted to know about subways; it also allows you to see New York from a novel, revealing vantage point...In every way, it's a terrific book.\\" In the Los Angeles Times, Devon Jerslid wrote: \\"Subway Lives may be hard-boiled, but it's best understood as an epic poem, and Dwyer himself comes across as a faintly Homeric figure, a late 20th-century urban bard who finds something heroic in (and under) the mean streets of Gotham.\\" Much of the material for the book came from his job as the subway columnist from 1986 to 1989 for New York Newsday. Film and theater The filmmaker Ken Burns described Dwyer as the Greek chorus of the 2012 documentary, Central Park Five, made by Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon, on the wrongful convictions of five teenagers in an attack on a jogger. The actor Michael Gaston portrayed Dwyer in Lucky Guy', a play by Nora Ephron about Dwyer's friend Mike McAlary, the late Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning columnist, that ran on Broadway in 2013, starring Tom Hanks as McAlary.

He was Chief Judge of that court from 1997 to 2004. He began a second term as Chief Judge in 2018. From 1991 to 1993 and again from 2001 to 2007, he was a nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. His federal appellate nomination from 2001 to 2007 is the longest in history not to be acted upon by the United States Senate.  Education and career  Born in Passaic, New Jersey, Boyle received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Brown University in 1967 and a Juris Doctor from the Washington College of Law at American University in 1970. From 1970 to 1973, he was the minority counsel of the Housing Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency. In 1973, he was a legislative assistant to Republican Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. He was in private practice in Elizabeth City, North Carolina from 1974 to 1984.  Federal judicial service  Boyle was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on April 4, 1984, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina vacated by Judge Franklin Taylor Dupree Jr. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 24, 1984, and received commission on May 3, 1984. He served as Chief Judge from 1997 to 2004. He became Chief Judge once again in 2018.  First Fourth Circuit nomination  On October 22, 1991, Boyle was nominated by US President George H. W. Bush to a newly-created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, but his nomination was not acted upon by the Senate, which was controlled by the Democrats. His nomination was allowed to lapse at the end of Bush's presidency.  Fourth Circuit controversies  On December 24, 1995, in the hope of integrating the Fourth Circuit, US President Bill Clinton nominated James A. Beaty Jr., an African-American judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, to a Fourth Circuit seat vacated by Judge James Dickson on Phillips Jr. in 1994, when he took senior status. Almost immediately, Beaty's nomination ran into opposition from Jesse Helms, who was angry that Clinton had refused to renominate Boyle to the Fourth Circuit. Beaty's nomination was ultimately unsuccessful because of Helms's opposition. On May 9, 2001, Boyle was renominated by President George W. Bush to the Fourth Circuit, this time to the seat vacated by Phillips Jr, but his nomination was never brought to a vote on the floor of the Senate. For over five years, the nomination was stalled, the longest federal appeals court nomination that was never given a full Senate vote. His nomination was adamantly opposed by the Democratic Party from the beginning. Democratic Senator John Edwards claimed Boyle was an opponent of civil rights and disabilities legislation. Boyle's supporters viewed him as the victim of political payback and obstruction because of his ties to Helms, who had derailed several judicial nominations by Clinton because of Boyle. In March 2005, after Bush's re-election and an increased RepublicanParty Senate majority, the Senate Judiciary Committee gave Boyle a hearing, almost a full four years after his nomination. On June 16, 2005, Boyle was voted out of Committee on a 10-8 party line vote. In April 2006, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said he would try to schedule a vote in May on the nomination of Boyle. No vote occurred, however; with the Democrats taking over the US Senate in the 110th Congress, Boyle's confirmation chances markedly decreased. On January 9, 2007, the White House announced that it would not renominate Boyle. At the time, Boyle clearly stated he did not voluntarily withdraw his nomination.www.newsobserver.com . On July 17, 2007, US President George W. Bush nominated United States District Court Judge Robert J. Conrad, to the Phillips seat; Conrad's nomination was also unsuccessful. See also * George H.W.

In 2008, Miller earned a mention in Talkers Magazine. Although he did not make the cut for inclusion in the magazine's ‚ÄúHeavy Hundred‚Äù list, he was listed in the unranked 101 to 250 category.http://www.savewrko.com/2008/02/13/talk-hosts-ranked/ The website VisitingNewEngland.com called him \\"for the most part, a fair and balanced talk show host with a deeply developed thought process and a slight chip-on-the- shoulder attitude.\\" Politically, Miller reportedly leans libertarian but differs with some of the typical Libertarian Party positions on matters of criminal justice, and national defense.  Biography  Miller was born on October 9, 1970 in Muncie, Indiana. After his father died in 1986, he moved from Indiana to live with his mother in New Jersey. He attended Howell High School with future CBS sportscaster Bonnie Bernstein, who was featured on his radio show several times, as well as filmmaker Brian Jude. Miller dropped out of Trenton State College, moved to western Kansas and began his radio career in March 1992 at 1420 AM KULY in Ulysses, Kansas. He worked at High Plains Public Radio in Garden City, Kansas before enrolling at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas,where he wrote columns for the school's daily newspaper, K-State Collegian.  Radio career  After earning a bachelor of arts in social science in 1996, Miller moved to Kansas City to work as a producer for then-sister stations AM 980 KMBZ and AM 810 KCMO. He moved to Los Angeles in 1998 to produce The John & Ken Show, which at the time was syndicated nationwide. He also worked as a phone screener for Stephanie Miller before moving back to Kansas City. In 2000, Miller hosted his first talk radio show at AM 580 WIBW in Topeka, Kansas. The following year, Miller began hosting a weekend show and producing the weekday morning show on AM 710 KCMO. In the spring of 2002, Miller was named the host of a morning drive radio talk show in Tulsa, Oklahoma but, according to Miller, was fired after just a few weeks \\"for not being conservative enough.\\" By the end of 2002, Miller was hosting The Scotto Show in afternoon drive on AM 810 WGY in Albany, New York. In the days after the start of the Iraq War, Miller promoted and spoke at a rally to show support for military servicemen and their families that drew 10,000 people to upstate New York, according to the Boston Globe. Miller began airing on Boston's WRKO in September 2003, replacing morning show co-host John \\"Ozone\\" Osterlind. He shared hosting duties with Peter Blute, a Republican career politician who had represented Massachusetts' Third District in Congress and directed Massport before joining WRKO in 1999. In May 2004 Miller wrote an op/ed article in the Boston Globe critical of the Federal Communications Commission's crackdown on broadcast indecency. After Blute departed WRKO in September 2005 to pursue other interests, WRKO launched Boston This Morning with Miller as its sole host. While Blute and Scotto discussed a few select issues of the day in depth with guests and callers, Boston This Morning covered a wider range of stories through newsmaker interviews and breaking news coverage but with less time devoted to Miller's commentaries and interaction with callers. According to the Boston Herald, WRKO designed Boston This Morning to be more competitive with all-news market leader AM 1030 WBZ, but Boston Phoenix media critic Mark Jurkowitz has lamented that WRKO has transformed the freewheeling and funny Scotto into the much more serious and sober‚Äîand newsmanly‚ÄîScott Allen Miller. In the spring of 2006 the program was renamed The Scott Allen Miller Show and changed once again to a more relaxed, caller-friendly format without the frequent traffic and weather breaks, interviews with a variety of guests, and scarce audience participation of Boston This Morning. The Scott Allen Miller Show maintained a strong news presence through Miller's interviews with newsmakers and updates from WRKO's news anchors. Miller was fired from WRKO http://internet128.com/index.php/2007/10/18/scott-allen-miller-leaves-howie- carr-cant-and-mike-felger-is-pretty-entertaining/ in 2007.,https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/1213555461.html?dids=1213555461:1213555461&FMT;=ABS&FMTS;=ABS:FT&date;=Feb+9%2C+2007&author;=JESSICA+HESLAM&pub;=Boston+Herald&edition;=&startpage;=2&desc;=Radio+daze+for+bounced+host to be replaced by former Massachusetts Speaker of the House Tom Finneran. Miller's last day on the station was February 9. Miller returned to Albany in October 2007 to replace Paul Vandenburgh on WROW, beginning on October 22. Miller departed WROW in 2008, hosting his final show on August 29. Since his departure from WRKO he has occasionally filled in for John Gibson on his Fox News Radio show as well as for Jeff Bolton and Jon David Wells on 570 KLIF in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. Scott also filled in for Spencer Hughes on Fox Across America, a Fox News Radio show.  Personal life  As a child, Miller attended a Pentecostal church and occasionally attended services at Trinity Church in Boston with his wife, but long insisted he was an agnostic. However, on January 12, 2007 Miller announced he had converted to Orthodox Christianity; He and his daughters were baptized into the faith on Easter of that year, with his wife Chrismated on Easter of the following year. He said that his religious conversion began when he attended a service at an Orthodox church in South Boston with a friend more than a year before. He further went on to say that his faith is helping him be optimistic about his future after being released from his show on WRKO. He is an avid reader of Orthodox Theological literature, including writings of the Church Fathers, and will discuss them at length with those who show interest. Miller has a blog called the Scotto Bloggo which he occasionally updates, though less frequently than in the past. According to the John Gibson radio program as said on 8/15/2011, Miller will not be hosting the radio program anymore because he will be working on become a priest.

The story is a sort of variation on the Jongleur de Notre Dame and Little Drummer Boy themes. The Knights of the Silver Shield, is included in Olive Beaupre Miller's Book House for Children anthology of children's literature. It is a story about how sometimes the resistance of temptation and the simple act of gate-keeping can be an act of valor to rival all others. \\"A Tournament of Stories\\" is the subtitle of Alden's last children's book. Its frame story features a kingdom whose Chief Story-Teller has recently died. Nine story- tellers finally vie for the position by telling one story each to Prince John, Princess Jane, and a jury of children.

The theme of the World Youth Day was \\"You are the salt of the earth... you are the light of the world.\\" Shortly after the World Youth Day, Thomas Rosica was approached by the founder of St. Joseph Communications, Gaetano Gagliano, to run a religious television network. The new television station was named \\"Salt + Light Television\\" after the theme of the World Youth Day 2002 and began its broadcast on July 1, 2003 with only two employees.

Some of these people included; Benjamin Lees, John Cage, George Crumb, George Rochberg, Ned Rorem, Karel Husa, and William Schuman. Berry edited the interviews to make them a half-hour in length, often adding excerpts of the particular composers music. In Santa Cruz, California, he became acquainted with the Hungarian cellist, composer, and former conductor for the Honolulu Symphony, George Barati. In the 1990s he presented performances of his music in San Francisco with George Barati, Lou Harrison, and an electronic composer, Charles Amirkhanian. Mr. Berry records exclusively for Centaur Records. His Cello Concerto, Symphony No. 3 and other works were released in 2008 on Centaur CD #2898.

Currently, two subspecies are recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here. Taxonomy The taxonomic history of this species is convoluted. Previously, seven other C. viridis subspecies were also recognized, including C. v. abyssus, C. v. caliginis, C. v. cerberus, C. v. concolor, C. v. helleri, C. v. lutosus and C. v. oreganus. However, in 2001 Ashton and de Queiroz described their analysis of the variation of mitochondrial DNA across the range of this species. Their results agreed broadly with those obtained by Pook et al. (2000). Two main clades were identified, east and west of the Rocky Mountains, which they argued were actually two different species: on the one hand C. viridis, including the conventional subspecies C. v. viridis and C. v. nuntius, and on the other C. oreganus, including all the other traditional subspecies of C. viridis. The authors retained the names of the traditional subspecies, but emphasized the need for more work to be done on the systematics of C. oreganus.Viperidae - Crotalinae - 2001 Publications.

Common names for this species include prairie rattlesnake and Hopi rattlesnake. Description This species commonly grows to more than in length. The maximum recorded size is . In Montana, specimens occasionally exceed in length; the species reaches its maximum size in this region. One of the most characteristic features is the presence of three or more, usually four, internasal scales.Campbell JA, Lamar WW. 2004. The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates. 870 pp. 1500 plates. . Identification characteristics will vary depending on which subspecies is encountered. Generally, western rattlesnakes are usually lightly colored in hues of brown. Patches of dark brown are often distributed in a dorsal pattern. A color band may be seen at the back of the eye. The western rattlesnake group carries the distinctive triangle-shaped head and pit sensory organs on either side of the head. A key characteristic that can help differentiate a western rattlesnake from other rattlesnakes is the presence of two internasals contacting the rostral.Stebbins RC. 2003. A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians, Third edition. The Peterson Field Guide Series ¬Æ. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company. xiii + 533 pp. . Distribution and habitat They, and the subspecies mentioned below, are found in North America over much of the Great Plains, the eastern foothills and some intermontane valleys of the Rocky Mountains, from southwestern Canada through the United States to northern Mexico. In Canada, they occur in Alberta and Saskatchewan; in the US in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, southern Idaho, most of Montana (where it is one of 10 snake species and the only venomous one), North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, extreme eastern Arizona, extreme western Iowa, and in Mexico in northern Coahuila and northwestern Chihuahua. Its vertical range is from near the Rio Grande to over in elevation in Wyoming. Wright and Wright (1957) and Klauber (1997) both mention Utah as within the range of this species, including maps showing it confined to the extreme southeastern part of the state.Klauber LM. 1997 (Reprint). Rattlesnakes: Their Habitats, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind. Second Edition. Berkeley: University of California Press. 1,580 pp. (2 volumes). (First published in 1956, 1972). . The type locality is described as \\"the Upper Missouri [Valley, USA]\\". An emendation was proposed by H.M. Smith and Taylor (1950) to \\"Gross, Boyd County, Nebraska.\\" Habitat characteristics can vary depending on subspecies and range. Generally, western rattlesnakes occupy areas with an abundant prey base. Many subspecies occupy somewhat rocky areas with outcrops serving as den sites. Western rattlesnakes have also been known to occupy burrows of other animals.Shipley, B.K., D. Chiszar, K.T. Fitzgerald, and A.J. Saviola. \\"Spatial ecology of Prairie Rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis) associated with Black- tailed Prairie Dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies in Colorado.\\" Herpetological Conservation and Biology 8, no. 1 (2013): 240-250. http://www.herpconbio.org/Volume_8/Issue_1/Shipley_etal_2013.pdf They seem to prefer dry areas with moderate vegetation coverage. Vegetation cover will vary depending on region and subspecies. Behavior In a defensive posture. Western rattlesnakes live on the land, but they can sometimes climb in trees or bushes. Some even rest in crevices or caves. They are typically active diurnally in cooler weather and nocturnally during hot weather C. viridis. This species complex is equipped with powerful venom, using about 20-55 percent of venom in one bite, and will defend themselves if threatened or injured. As with other rattlesnake species, western rattlesnakes will rapidly vibrate their tails, which produces a unique rasping sound to warn intruders. The venom of the western rattlesnake is a complexly structured mixture of different proteins with enzymes such as proteases and peptidases found among them.Saviola, A.J., Pla, D., Sanz, L., Castoe, T.A., Calvete, J.J. and Mackessy, S.P., 2015.

Taschenatlas der Toxikologie: Substanzen, Wirkungen, Umwelt [=Pocket Atlas of Toxicology: Substances, Effects, Environment ]. (Chapter: \\"Venoms\\"). Hamburg: Nikol Verlag. . (in German). =Diet= Western rattlesnakes, because of their expansive distribution, have a wide array of prey. Generally, this species prefers small mammals, such as ground squirrels, ground nesting birds, mice, rats, small rabbits and prairie dogs. They will occasionally feed on amphibians and reptiles, and sometimes even other snakes. This is more commonly seen in juvenile snakes. =Reproduction= Western rattlesnakes are viviparous and can produce from one to 25 young per reproduction event. The average number of young ranges from four to 12, but can vary greatly due to availability of food and environmental conditions. Males may compete for females during the breeding season, but western rattlesnake females may not necessarily breed every year.C. viridis They give birth in late summer or early fall, being their breed 22‚Äì28 cm long, without the need for parental care. In addition, their pups are toxic as soon as they are born. They reach sexual maturity at three years of age. It is also common for females to give birth at communal den sites with the young born between August and October.C. virdis. Accessed 7 October 2009. Conservation status This species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (v3.1, 2001). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The population trend was stable when assessed in 2006.

She recorded alongside sopranos such as Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Early life and career: 1930‚Äì1955 Margaret Ann Enid Geater was born in Brisbane, Queensland. She began her vocal studies at a convent school before winning an Australian state scholarship in 1949. That same year, she married Henry ElkinsMark McGinnes Statuesque yet steely soprano The Age, 9 April 2009 and adopted Margreta Elkins as her stage name. Also that year she competed in the Mobil Quest against Joan Sutherland. In 1950, she toured Queensland and appeared in Faust as Si√©bel; Il trovatore as Azucena; and Madama Butterfly as Suzuki. In 1952 she joined and toured with the National Opera Company of Australia,. .the company toured in that year as New South Wales National Opera. Read bio. of Clarice Lorenz, founder and managing director of the then company. making her first appearances in Brisbane as Carmen in 1953 and as Azucena, in 1954. She entered the Mobil Quest again in 1956, winning second prize. International success: 1956‚Äì1969 Moving to Europe in 1956, she was based there for the next twenty years. She began her European career performing with the Dublin Grand Opera Society and the Carl Rosa Opera Company in such roles as the title role in Carmen and Dorabella in Cos√¨ fan tutte. In 1958, she became a resident principal mezzo-soprano at The Royal Opera, making her debut there as Amneris in Aida. She sang regularly at that house for the next ten years in such operas as Lucia di Lammermoor as Alisa; Der Rosenkavalier as Octavian; Die Walk√ºre as Sieglinde; and Malcolm Williamson's The Growing Castle as The Poet, among others. She also notably sang Hippolyta in the London premiere of Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1961), directed by Sir John Gielgud, and portrayed the role of Helen in the world premiere of Michael Tippett's King Priam on 29 May 1962 in Coventry. Her other opera roles included Herodias in Salome, Maffio Orsini in Lucrezia Borgia, Brang√§ne in Tristan und Isolde, and Delilah in Samson and Delilah. Elkins was a frequent collaborator with Joan Sutherland for performances in London, sharing the stage with her in Norma as Adalgisa; Alcina as Ruggiero; Rodelinda as Bertarido; and as Alisa to Sutherland's Lucia. Elkins also sang the role of Alisa opposite Maria Callas's Lucia for her 1959 recording of the opera with conductor Tullio Serafin. Callas had heard Elkins in rehearsal and chose her to sing Alisa for the EMI recording. Elkins partnership with Sutherland also resulted in a number of studio recordings of complete operas led by Richard Bonynge for Decca Records. She also joined Sutherland and Bonynge's 1965 tour of Australia with the Sutherland-Williamson Opera Company. In November 1964, Elkins appeared alongside No√´l Coward, Dame Margot Fonteyn and others in a 90th birthday tribute to Sir Winston Churchill. It was around this time that she declined an offer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, as she did not like the part she was offered. She had earlier refused an offer to sing at Glyndebourne, for contractual reasons. However, Elkins did make appearances at the Teatro di San Carlo, the Teatro Carlo Felice, the Liceu, the Opera Company of Boston and the New Orleans Opera during the 1960s. She also sang two roles with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company, Si√©bel in 1965 and Adalgisa in 1968, both with Sutherland.Free Library of Philadelphia: Box: Phila. Lyric Opera Company: 782.1 P5326p Bal Two [1968‚Äì1975]  Later life and career: 1970‚Äì2009  In 1970, Elkins had a daughter, Emma. After the birth of her daughter she decided to limit significantly her performances outside Australia and spent most her remaining career performing in her own country after the early 1970s. She toured Australia in recital for the ABC a number of times and became a principal member of the Australian Opera in 1976. That same year she declined an offer to sing at the Bayreuth Festival for family reasons. But she remained a committed Wagnerian and considered her Sieglinde in Die Walk√ºre for the AO as the highlight of her career. She left AO to go freelance in 1980. She recorded Elgar's Sea Pictures with the Queensland Symphony Orchestra in 1983, a recording which is often compared favourably with Dame Janet Baker's. On 11 June 1984, Elkins was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for service to opera.It's an Honour She was a Sessional Lecturer in Voice at the Queensland Conservatorium and taught at The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.Queensland Conservatorium She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Queensland in 1986. In 1990, she appeared as Azucena in Il trovatore for Queensland Lyric Opera. In 2002 she returned to the stage once more, as Mamma Lucia in Cavalleria rusticana for Opera Queensland where she was an honorary life member. She died in Brisbane of cancer in 2009, aged 78, survived by her husband and daughter.

Town in the novels of E F Benson  Tilling takes its name from the River Tillingham which flows through Rye. Benson himself moved to Rye in 1918, where he lived in Lamb House, former home of the novelist Henry James. Benson was mayor of Rye 1934-7 and was elected Speaker of the Cinque Ports in 1936.  Mapp and Lucia  Tilling first appeared in Miss Mapp (1922) and subsequently in The Male Impersonator and Desirable Residences (short stories of 1929), Mapp and Lucia (1931), set between June 1930 and the spring of 1931, in which Emmeline Lucas (\\"Lucia\\") and Elizabeth Mapp clashed for the first time, Lucia's Progress (1935) and Trouble for Lucia (1939). The novelist Susan Leg, the subject of Secret Lives (1932), re- appeared in Trouble for Lucia. The first Lucia book, Queen Lucia, was published in 1920. It was followed in 1927 by Lucia in London. Benson's The Freaks of Mayfair (1916) provided the genesis of some of the characters of Tilling. Specifically, \\"Aunt Georgie\\", a bachelor with a penchant for embroidery, provided the model for George Pillson, who, as with Lucia, with whom he entered into a platonic marriage in Lucia's Progress, originally lived at Riseholme (thought to have been modelled on Broadway) in the Cotswolds. In the final Benson Lucia book Trouble for Lucia Tilling seems to be no longer in Sussex but in Hampshire. In the 1980s, following the adaptations by Gerald Savory (1909‚Äì96) of Benson's novels for London Weekend Television (1985‚Äì86), in which Tilling was referred to as \\"Tilling-on-Sea\\" (a form unknown in the books), two pastiches by Tom Holt (b. 1961), based in Tilling, were published by Macmillan: Lucia in Wartime (1985) and Lucia Triumphant (1986). Holt also produced a short story, Diplomatic Incident, for the former Tilling Society in 1998 and another called Great Minds for the Friends of Tilling in 2006. The Friends of Tilling organise an annual gathering in Rye each September for devotees of Mapp & Lucia and E F Benson's other comic novels. Two other Tilling books, Major Benjy and Au Reservoir, were written by Guy Fraser- Sampson and published by Troubador. In 2014 the BBC made a new three-part series adapted by Steve Pemberton (who also played Georgie Pillson) from the original Mapp and Lucia novel.  Topography  Lamb House, Rye: home of E F Benson and model for Mallards in Tilling Lamb House was the model for \\"Mallards\\", the home initially of Elizabeth Mapp and subsequently of Lucia, who renamed it Mallards House. Cynthia & Tony Reavell (1984) E F Benson: Mr Benson remembered in Rye, and the World of Tilling contained a map of Tilling that drew on references in the books and the layout of Rye itself. A similar plan was reproduced in Holt's novels. In some instances, the street names of Tiling and Rye coincided ‚Äì for example, High Street (the location of Godiva Plaistow's house, \\"Wasters\\") and West Street (\\"Quaint\\" Irene Coles' \\"Taormina\\") ‚Äì but there were some variations: Mermaid Street became, in Tilling, Porpoise Street (where Algernon and Susan Wyse lived); Market Road was Malleson Street (Woolgar & Pipstow, the estate agents); and Watchbell Street was Curfew Street (the Trader's Arms). In Rye a lookout, presented by Benson when he was mayor in 1935, stands towards the River Rother and Camber, with a plaque noting that its donor had \\"immortalised\\" the town as Tilling through his books.  Tilling Gazette  The local newspaper in the TV version was the Tilling Gazette and in the book Lucia's Progress it was the Hastings Chronicle but in Trouble for Lucia, this inexplicably became the Hampshire Argus (editor, Mr McConnell). (In Savory's adaptation for television, McConnell was introduced to Elizabeth Mapp by her intoxicated husband, Major Mapp-Flint, as \\"a veritable pilling of Tillar\\".)  Imports from Riseholme  The custom in Tilling of saying \\"au reservoir\\" as a valediction (in place of the French au revoir) was a feature of Miss Mapp, although it became apparent in Mapp and Lucia that it had originated with Lucia in Riseholme. It was transported to Tilling by Elizabeth Mapp who had stayed one summer at the Ambermere Arms in Riseholme. The lexicographer Eric Partridge suggested that in fact the term had originated in America in the 1880s.Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, several editions 1937‚Äì61 Lucia's celebrated recipe Lobster √† la Riseholme was first served in Tilling in Mapp and Lucia.  Rail and tramways  A railway station opened in Rye in 1851 and there are various references in the Benson books to a local station. In the BBC's 2014 dramatisation, townsfolk gather at a station depicted as \\"Tilling Town\\" in the hope of catching a glimpse of the Prince of Wales. In John van Druten's play, Make Way for Lucia (1948), based on Benson's novels, Lucia refers to Georgie Pillson and Major Benjamin Flint having breakfasted together in East Tilling. This appears to be the next station on the line between Tilling and London.Make Way for Lucia, Act III, scene 1. There is no comparable real-life location and the next stop to the east of Rye is (and was in the 1920s/30s) Appledore, located two miles from the village of that name. Benson makes no reference to East Tilling. Van Druten may have had in mind the Cinque Port of Winchelsea, which lies a few miles to the west of Rye and is the next station in that direction. Some of Benson's characters, notably Major Flint, use a tramway to get to the golf links outside the town. This was based on the Rye and Camber Tramway, which closed for good during the Second World War. The links station building remains, across the Rother from Rye Harbour, as does evidence of the track bed.  Riseborough  Benson's Mrs Ames (1912) was set in Riseborough, which also bore a resemblance to Rye. Though this antedated Benson's move to Rye, he already knew the town well, having, for example, first visited Henry James at Lamb House in 1900.Benson (1940) Final Edition Patricia Wentworth: Tilling Green A village called Tilling Green, in the fictional county of Ledshire, appeared in one of Patricia Wentworth's Miss Silver stories, Poison in the Pen (1955).

It was originally transmitted on Monday, 23 December 1974. Plot Mainwaring tells Wilson that before a battle, their commander told them a joke. However, when Mainwaring attempts to cheer up his unusually quiet platoon with a joke, it does not work. Jones asks Mainwaring if he and his section can speak to him in private. Once in the office, Jones admits that he took his section for a quick drink in the Horse and Groom. Mainwaring is less than impressed, so is annoyed when he hears that they also stopped in the King's Head to stop Cheeseman shivering, and stopped in the Goat and Compasses. Mainwaring is then amused to learn that Godfrey had begun to sing rather raucously, so he was taken into the Red Lion to sober up. The landlord had come up to Jones and had told him about something rustling in the haystack. Jones shot at the rustler, and was shocked to learn that it was a turkey, which is now plucked and stuffed in his refrigerator! Mainwaring is shocked, and insists that they pay Mr Boggis, farmer at the North Berrington Turkey Farm, the only place where the turkey could have come from, for the loss of his turkey. However, Mr Boggis is not there. Eventually they discover Mr Boggis is at market day; however the farm worker is unwilling to accept money for the bird unless he is certain that one is missing. They attempt to count the birds, and discover after much chaos that no birds are missing. Therefore, Jones' section decides to hold a turkey dinner for the OAPs of Walmington-on-Sea. Mainwaring is delighted and decides to organise a Turkey Dinner General Purposes Committee, with himself as chairman, of course. Mrs Fox will cook the turkey, Mrs Pike decides to make the stuffing, and Mrs Cheeseman will make the gravy. Everything goes well, until Mainwaring emerges from the office in his dinner suit: he is guest speaker at a Rotary Club dinner. Pike whirls around with a plate in his hand, and accidentally spills gravy all over Mainwaring's suit. Jones uses blotting paper to get rid of the gravy, but ends up making a mess of Mainwaring's shirt, which he covers up with white enamel paint, which ends up on Mainwaring's dinner jacket. A sling is the only answer to the problems, as it will not only hide the paint, but it will also make Mr Mainwaring appear more brave at the dinner. However, Hodges comes bursting through the door, bumping into Pike, and knocking gravy onto his sling once again.

Salton signed professionally in March 1989, and made his league debut at Elland Road against Leeds United on 29 February 1992 in the Football League First Division. However, Luton were relegated at the end of that season and were denied a place in the new FA Premier League.

Zinacant√°n literally means \\"land of bats\\" and comes from the Nahuatl language. People in Zinacant√°n speak Tzotzil (a Mayan language) and they call their own land \\"Sots'leb\\", that is, \\"land of bats\\" in their own language.

Other than the town of Zinacant√°n, the municipality had 60 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: Navenchauc (4,625), Past√© (3,771), classified as urban, and Nachig (3,260), Apas (1,485), Patosil (1,452), Zequentic (1,201), and Bochojbo Alto (1,088), classified as rural. Traditional charges and feasts Many feasts are celebrated during the year. In every feast men are in charge of the celebration‚Äîthey are: martomoetik, alperesetik, and moletik. The first two of these three names are loan words from the Spanish mayordomos and alf√©rez, respectively. They have to pay whatever is needed in order to celebrate the feasts. These three kinds of cargos (‚Äúcharges‚Äù) are in fact a hierarchy. They constitute an ascending scale in the same order as they are described below. One can never become one of the moletik if he hasn't been a martomo first and then an alperes. These charges are just for men, although their wives have important roles in their husbands' charges. There are twelve martomoetik, twelve alperesetik and six moletik, who are chosen by the inhabitants of Zinacantan every year. Each one has a different feast assigned to him during the year, although they each have to assist in every feast throughout the year. 211x211px The martomoetik are those in charge to buy whatever is needed for the feast within the church (flowers, candles, pine leaves, etc.). The alperesetik are those who buy and prepare everything needed for the feast outside the church: fireworks, kamer√≥ (which is a sort of ‚Äúbomb‚Äù or explosive that they use at certain moments of the feast in order to emphasize its importance), etc. The moletik are the elders who are in charge of teaching the younger chargers how to organize the feast. Three days before of the very day of the feast they begin to celebrate by wearing their traditional clothes and performing the corresponding traditional rites. The patron saint of Zinacant√°n is San Lorenzo (Saint Lawrence), whose feast day is 10 August. This traditional feast lasts four days (8‚Äì10 August). The feast of Saint Sebastian, 20 January, is also important in Zinacantan. In fact, Saint Sebastian's feast lasts from 18 to 22 January. There are also many other feasts which are less important, including Epiphany on 6 January, Our Lady of the Candelaria on 2 February, Ash Wednesday, Holy Week, Pentecost, Saint Dominic on 4 August, Saint Matthiew on 22 September, and Christmas. History In pre-Columbian times before the conquerors' arrival, Zinacant√°n already had strong links with the Aztecs in the Central Zone of Mexico. Zinacantecans exchanged their products (especially salt, but by the 19th century also cacao, tobacco, and coffee) with Aztec traders. The first missionaries who came to evangelize the native inhabitants in Zinacant√°n were the Dominican Friars. They settled in Zinacantan in the 16th century and built a wooden chapel to begin their mission. These missionaries left Zinacant√°n before they were expelled from Mexico by the government in the 17th century. They resumed their pastoral work in Zinacantan in 1976. An important development in Zinacant√°n was the construction of the Pan American Highway, which significantly improved the mobility and prosperity of the Zinacanteco population, as it enabled them to easily transport goods to market such as maize and flowers.

The northern part of the island is known as Museum Island. Fischerinsel is normally said to extend south from Gertraudenstra√üe and is named for a fishermen's settlement which formerly occupied the southern end of the island. Until the mid-twentieth-century it was a well preserved pre-industrial neighbourhood, and most of the buildings survived World War II, but in the 1960s and 1970s under the German Democratic Republic it was levelled and replaced with a development of residential tower blocks.

In the 18th century, boating professions became less important as the city industrialised. As a result, in the early 19th century, the Fischerinsel district stopped developing and became a neighbourhood which preserved the look of old Berlin, including the last gabled houses in the city. In the 20th century it became a tourist attraction. The neighbourhood and its high street, Fischerstra√üe, remained comparatively untouched after World War II.Brian Ladd, The Ghosts of Berlin: Confronting German History in the Urban Landscape, Chicago: University of Chicago, 1997, , p. 47.The Luisenst√§dtische Bildungsverein encyclopedia entry and the city tourist information page on the Fischerinsel state that there was considerable destruction in the Fischerinsel: \\"stark zerst√∂rt\\", \\"weitgehend zerst√∂rt\\". Like the rest of the borough of Mitte, it fell into the Soviet Zone which became East Berlin. In 1954, a plan was drawn up for the neighbourhood which emphasised conservation of the surviving buildings. Later plans envisaged replacement with low density housing (1957) and a perimeter development of tower blocks.

History  Cedar High School Was originally part of Branch Normal School, a branch of the University of Utah. The responsibility for running the school was transferred to Utah State University. When this happened, the school's name was changed to Branch Agricultural College, what is today Southern Utah University. As the town and number of students grew, the need for an independent high school became apparent. Cedar High School was founded in September 1940. The school building was located on Center and 300 West just north of the Randall L. Jones auditorium on the SUU campus. It was designed to house 350 students and became overcrowded as the student body grew to 500. It was torn down in 2000 to make room for a parking lot. The school was founded in 1941 and incorporated high school students from the nearby Branch Agricultural College. In 1942 CHS got its mascot under President Jay Thorley. Cedar High School belongs to the Iron County School District. The current building was completed for the 1963-1964 Academic year, and was extremely modern for the time. The Building has undergone several expansions over the years. The most recent expansion was completed in 2010, and includes a new commons area, state-of-the-art band room, and an all new counseling center. Current enrollment is approximately 1100. The principal is John Dodds. Until 1997 Cedar High was the city's only secondary school; for many decades its students participated in a fierce rivalry with Dixie High School in St. George, Utah (another one-high school town until the 1980s). For the past decade the hometown rivals have been the Canyon View High School Falcons. Cedar High School has a choir, orchestra and band groups, theater program, and art department. CHS has a pep band, which plays at all of the home football and basketball games. CHS also has a jazz band which has won the state championship six times in a row. CHS has also fielded many champion cross-country teams. Sports The Cedar High School football team has played in the state championship winning all three times. CHS sports include baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, Mohey Tawa (drill team), soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, volleyball, water polo and wrestling. The boys' basketball team won their first 2A State championship in 1975. They won the 3A Utah State Basketball Championship in 1994 and 1995. The boys' baseball team won the 3A Utah State Champtionship in 1975. Notable alumni * Ally Condie - author of the New York Times bestseller Matched * Michael O.

The issue that the government might seek to regulate the activities and civil rights of superheroes, who are either criminalized or deemed to be a threat to the safety of the general public, who may be denied habeas corpus or detained indefinitely without trial, or viewed as valuable national security resource subject to forced conscription without notice in times of crisis, has also been explored in other comics, such as those featuring DC's Justice Society of America team, series like Watchmen, Astro City, and Powers; the films The Return of Captain Invincible (1983) and The Incredibles (2004); and in role- playing games Brave New World (1999), and Dawn of Legends for Savage Worlds. This kind of plot point is especially rich and extensively explored in the fictional universes of various comic book stories that are published by Marvel Comics. The first mention of the broad concept was in Uncanny X-Men #141 (January 1981). The actual term \\"Registration Act\\" was first used in Uncanny X-Men #181 (May 1984). As their names suggest, Mutant Registration Act and Superhuman Registration Act deal with the registration of mutants and superhumans respectively. The Mutant Registration Act has also been featured in both the original X-Men animated series and the X-Men films. Numerous versions of each bill have been proposed at different times and in different jurisdictions in the Marvel Universe. The Superhuman Registration Act is a major plot point in Marvel's 2006 crossover limited series Civil War, which was loosely adapted in the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War. This version was called the Sokovia Accords. The Registration Acts as a concept =Publication history= The idea that enhanced individuals might need to be \\"regulated\\" or \\"registered\\" by the government was first raised in specific relation to Marvel Comics' mutants. In Uncanny X-Men #141, (written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne) the concept is briefly suggested. In that issue the term \\"Registration Act\\" is not used, but one character (Moira MacTaggert) brings up the notion of \\"registration\\". In reference to a politician whom she suspects of anti-mutant bigotry she says: :\\"Registration today, gas chambers tomorrow\\". The same issue features mention of the \\"Mutant Control Act\\", however it is left unclear exactly what that legislation involves and whether some form of registration is a part of it. However, in New Mutants #1, it was implied that involved the operation of concentration camps. The term \\"Mutant Registration Act\\" was first fully used in Uncanny X-Men #181, by writer Chris Claremont. As the MRA (as it became known) was passed into law in the Marvel Universe it became widely used as a subplot, plot device or background element across Marvel's entire line of titles, especially those featuring mutants (such as Uncanny X-Men, X-Factor and New Mutants) during the late 1980s. In the early 1990s Chris Claremont left the X-titles and the topic of the MRA began to appear much more rarely in stories. It was still occasionally mentioned, though usually in the past tense, suggesting that it was repealed at some point (though this was never clearly shown) or that it simply ceased to be actively enforced. However, in an interview regarding the Civil War: X-Men limited series its writer David Hine suggested that it is still law in the Marvel Universe, stating that in the series the idea of bringing \\"the Mutant Registration Act in line with the SRA\\" will be discussed. The idea of an equivalent piece of legislation for non-mutant super-powered individuals‚Äîa Superhuman Registration Act‚Äîwas first raised in comics that were published during the \\"Acts of Vengeance\\" crossover in 1989-1990. The issue was most fully explored in Fantastic Four #335-336 by writer Walter Simonson. In the course of the story, the issue was apparently resolved with the proposed Act being shelved. The concept was then revived in 1993 in Alpha Flight (vol. 1) #120 (May 1993) by writer Simon Furman. In that issue a \\"Superpowers Registration Act\\" becomes law in Canada and went on to be a major plot point in the remainder of the series. However, later Alpha Flight series did not make use of the concept. In 2006 the concept was again revived by writer Mark Millar as the main plot point in Marvel's 2006 Civil War crossover. In preparation for that storyline a new version of the Superhuman Registration Act has been widely mentioned across various Marvel titles, with the issue being most widely discussed and explored in The Amazing Spider-Man #529 - 531 (April - June 2006) by writer J. Michael Straczynski. =Issues, allegories and metaphors= When the topic of the original Superhuman Registration Act is debated in Fantastic Four #335-336 the issue is explored in a national security context, with the utility of such a law being challenged. In the comics the Fantastic Four argue that super-heroes are already a hugely benevolent force for society and such an act would be unnecessary and possibly counter-productive. When the issue of an SRA was raised again in Amazing Spider-Man #529 - 531 the prospect of a new SRA is explored once more from a security perspective, with reference being made to the fact that super-powered individuals often wield abilities which have massively destructive potential for use, making some mechanism to regulate their activities necessary. The writer of Civil War, Mark Millar, has stated that that storyline explores the civil rights implications of the SHR as previous stories have done, but also explores the other side of the argument in more depth, in particular how Marvel super-heroes are, absent an SRA, illegal vigilantes, lacking proper legal authority or oversight. =Terms of the registration acts= In a June 2006 interview Civil War editor Tom Brevoort confirmed that registrants to the act were required to reveal their identities to the government (but not the public) and they have to undergo some basic testing or training and satisfy certain (as yet unspecified) standards before they gain legal authorization to continue to use their abilities to fight crime. Government employment is not mandatory, though it is available to those who wish to take it. This has not remained consistent, though, and characters have made reference to all superpowered individuals being forced to register and enlist in S.H.I.E.L.D. It was revealed in Amazing Spider-Man #535 that unregistered individuals are sent to a prison in the otherdimensional Negative Zone indefinitely until they agree to register. Iron Man claims that as this is off United States soil, they have almost no civil rights unless the United States Supreme Court explicitly rules otherwise‚Äîand he knows they won't. This leads Spider-Man to re-evaluate his support of the act. After the major conflict of Civil War ends, all the superhero inmates are transferred to real prisons in the state while the facility is transformed into a Maximum Security Prison for high- threat-level villains such as the Taskmaster and Lady Deathstrike. Marvel Universe =Marvel Comics= Mutant Control Act The first direct mention of a piece of legislation specifically aimed at super-humans in the Marvel Universe comes in Uncanny X-Men #141 (January 1981) in which the \\"Mutant Control Act\\", a law from the future, is mentioned. In the course of the story, the first part of the two-part \\"Days of Future Past\\" storyline, Kate Pryde travels back in time from a dystopian future to the present and possesses the body of her younger self, X-Men member Kitty Pryde. On revealing herself to Kitty's teammates she recounts to them the series of events which led to her dark future, in the hopes that the X-Men might be able to prevent those events from coming to pass. One of those pivotal events was the passing of a \\"Mutant Control Act\\" by the government of the United States. When the Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional the government responded by reactivating their robot Sentinel program so that they might police the mutant race. The Sentinels interpreted their mandate in such a way that they decided to forcibly take over the government of the country and instituted a harsh regime where mutants were severely persecuted. The reference to the Mutant Control Act is brief, and it is unclear exactly what its provisions would entail, though it would appear that registration forms at least one part of it. In the course of the story the X-Men are successful in preventing one of the pivotal events which Pryde had described to them (the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly) from occurring, though the story's end is intentionally ambiguous as to whether Pryde's dystopian future was fully avoided. Although no Mutant Control Act has been introduced in the comics, the Mutant Registration Act may be its equivalent and the events of \\"Days of Future Past\\" continue to be alluded to in X-Men comics as a possible future. 1982 British Super Hero Legislation During the events of the Jaspers' Warp story arc, an insane reality warper, Jim Jaspers, became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and turned the UK into a fascist state. As PM, he enforced \\"Super Hero Legislation\\"; using armored agents of S.T.R.I.K.E., the UK division of S.H.I.E.L.D., to hunt down and detain superhumans within the UK. However, the legislation is abandoned after Captain Britain defeated Jaspers. Mutant Registration Act Registration as a concept is first mentioned in Uncanny X-Men #141 in which Moira MacTaggert suggests that Robert Kelly deems the registration of mutants by the government as necessary.Uncanny X-Men #141: 21 (1981) Her suggestion eventually turns out to be accurate, and in the Uncanny X-Men #181 (May 1984) the first mention of a Mutant Control Act is made when Kelly is seen discussing his introduction of the Mutant Affairs Control ActUncanny X-Men #181: 21 (1984) with a senatorial colleague. It is then mentioned in #183 (1984) to have \\"stirred up the hornets' nest\\" (12) by Valerie Cooper. By #184 (July 1984) the Act is mentioned as introduced in Congress by Senator Kelly,Uncanny X-Men #184: 7 (1984) and in #188 Nightcrawler remarks the chance of it to become accepted as law is as high as never before,Uncanny X-Men #188: 16 (1984) suggesting that, unlike the Mutant Control Act in the \\"Days of Future Past\\" timeline, it would not be struck down by the Supreme Court. The passage of the MRA did not have an immediate impact on the plots of any Marvel series, but the legislation continued to be referenced intermittently in various titles. In at least one instance (X-Factor #1; February 1986), the Act is referred to as a \\"possible new law\\". In that story, the prospect of the MRA is one of the things which motivate Jean Grey and Cyclops to form X-Factor. The legislation becomes a plot point later when government agent Val Cooper and the mutant terrorist Mystique form Freedom Force, a government-sanctioned superhero team (mostly comprising former members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants) in Uncanny X-Men #199 (November 1985). Freedom Force went on to make many appearances where they sought to enforce the MRA by arresting unregistered mutants such as members of the X-Men (e.g. Uncanny X-Men #206, June 1986), X-Factor (e.g. X-Factor #30; July 1988) and the New Mutants (e.g. New Mutants #86, February 1990). They also appeared enforcing the MRA in non-X-Men-related titles such as Daredevil #269 (August 1989). Captain America (who at this point is John Walker, the character who would later be known as U.S. Agent) and Battlestar ‚Äì two other officially sanctioned super-heroes ‚Äì also briefly enforce the Act by capturing the unregistered mutant Meteorite for the government in Captain America (vol. 2) #343 (July 1988). During this period of active enforcement of the MRA, the only mutants who are shown publicly protesting the Act were those who were not aligned with the X-Men or its affiliated teams. For example, in X-Factor #33 the Alliance of Evil demonstrates against the MRA in Manhattan and after fighting X-Factor are arrested by Freedom Force and in Captain America #368 (March 1990) a mutant group called the Resistants are shown protesting the Act in Washington D.C. Indeed, far from publicly agitating against the act, one X-team (X-Factor, in its original form) actually pretend in public to be supporters of the MRA who are actively enforcing it, though in actuality they act to subvert it. With Freedom Force (the characters most involved in the enforcement of the Act) no longer existing (they disband following a disastrous mission in Iraq in X-Factor Annual #6, 1991) and Chris Claremont (the writer who developed the MRA as a sub-plot) no longer writing X-Men stories after 1992, the Mutant Registration Act stopped appearing prominently in Marvel Universe stories. =Proposition X= In an attempt to further subjugate the remaining mutant population, Simon Trask leads the Humanity Now! coalition in support of federal legislation called Proposition X. Proposition X if passed would have force mandatory chemical birth control on all mutants. While marching to San Francisco's city hall in support of Proposition X, Simon Trask and his followers met opposition by Hank McCoy, young mutants and mutant right activist. Hank McCoy's peaceful resistance against Proposition X eventually led to a fight between the opposing sides. In response Norman Osborn will declare martial law in San Francisco, which causes the riot that will plague the city the next few nights. These events will lead to Cyclops creating a new mutant sanctuary called Utopia, where mutants can be free from bigoted legislation. 1990 Metahuman Registration Act A variation on the concept of the Mutant Registration Act the Superhuman Registration Act concept is originally proposed in comic books published circa the \\"Acts of Vengeance\\" storyline, such as Punisher (vol. 2) #29 and Avengers (vol. 1) #313 (both January 1990). During that period, in Fantastic Four #335 and 336 (December 1989, January 1990) the Fantastic Four go to Congress where a committee is investigating whether an SRA, similar in its provisions to the already in effect Mutant Registration Act, is required for Superheroes (the MRA only covers individuals who have their powers inherently at birth, not those who acquire their abilities artificially in later life). In his testimony and in evidence he presents to Congress, Reed Richards argues that a Super-human registration Act is unnecessary as Super-humans have been largely effective and trustworthy in their actions and government regulation would only stifle their ability to protect the world. He argues that those individuals who were likely to act irresponsibly with their powers are also likely to be supervillains and thus would not be candidates for registration anyway. As the topic is debated, he and his teammates are continually attacked by random supervillains whom they easily subdue, though it is unclear if this helps or hinders his arguments. In his final point concerning the lack of any workable definition of superhuman Richards demonstrates a device that scans a human for physical and mental capabilities and compares those to the national average, marking 'significant outliers' as \\"superhuman\\". The device identifies several regular humans, including some committee members, as \\"superhuman\\" according to those criteria. The proposed legislation is abandoned and registration of superhumans in the United States is not recommended by the committee. 1993 Canadian Super-powers Registration Act A similarly titled \\"Super-powers Registration Act\\" is passed by the Canadian government in Alpha Flight #120 (May 1993). Introduced by a minister of the Canadian government named Robert Hagon, the Super-powers Registration Act is part of a complex plot engineered by the Master, who is using the alias \\"Joshua Lord\\". The terms of the act entail the government employment of all super-powered individuals, including mutants, who are then enlisted in one of the government Department H \\"Flight\\" programs such as \\"Alpha Flight\\" and \\"Gamma Flight\\". Although the Act was shown to be controversial and the first series ended with the disbandment of the Canadian government's superteams (the various \\"Flights\\") in Alpha Flight (vol. 1) #130 (March 1994), the Canadian SRA is never explicitly repealed or overturned within the comics. Later Alpha Flight series did not acknowledge the law. As of 2006, rumors began to circulate (encouraged by some Marvel creators such as Mark Millar) that a new Alpha Flight series of some form is in the planning stages. The rumors suggest that the premise of this series would involve American superheroes fleeing the United States to Canada to escape a newly enacted U.S. Superhuman Registration Act. This suggests that registration is no longer mandatory in the Marvel Universe version of Canada. In July 2006 Civil War editor Tom Brevoort concurred with this sentiment saying \\"we've seen no evidence of it in ten-plus years of Canadian appearances. So if such legislation did exist, it was evidently repealed at some point.\\" Other sources, however, such as Michael Avon Oeming's post-Civil War title Omega Flight, contradict this statement, which several characters mentioning having a Registration Act for years, without the negative effects of the American Superhuman Registration act.Talisman: We've had a Registration Act here for years...and we've never turned it against ourselves -- against our heroes! 2006 Superhuman Registration Act thumb Interest in the concept of the act was revived in various Marvel comic books in 2006. In New Avengers Special: the Illuminati (May 2006), following the events of \\"Decimation\\" and the sudden dramatic fall in the Mutant population, the U.S. government again considers a Superhuman Registration Act and Iron Man attempts to persuade his Illuminati colleagues to support the SRA, in order to diffuse it. Iron Man predicts that some superhuman or group of superhumans will eventually make a mistake that will cost hundreds of lives (he specifically mentions the Young Avengers and the Runaways as candidates for causing such a catastrophe). After such an event, he went on to predict, the government would inevitably rush to make an example of someone, or everyone, in the superhuman community by passing legislation that would be even more restrictive or persecutory towards them than the proposed SRA. By supporting the Act before it is passed, he suggests, he and his fellow Illuminati might be able to help avert such possible future tragedies and also, by becoming a part of the process, help moderate the legislation so that it would have the minimum possible negative effect on the superhuman community. However, most of the Illuminati members (except for Reed Richards, who had spoken against the similar proposition made 16 years before (see above)) flatly reject Stark's proposal, leading to the disbandment of the group. In Amazing Spider-Man #529-531 (April‚ÄìJune 2006), Spider-Man and Iron Man travel to Washington D.C. to discuss the issue. In those issues Iron Man is shown to be initially opposed to the idea, while Spider-Man is unsure of his opinion. In #531, the first part of Iron Man's prediction are shown to be accurate when a conflict between the New Warriors and a group of supervillains ends with a massive explosion which kills hundreds of people, including children attending a nearby school. As depicted in the Civil War crossover and series, the public outcry that follows this event leads the government (with the support of Iron Man and fellow Illuminati member Reed Richards) to quickly enact the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA), 6 U.S.C. ¬ß 558, which required those with naturally occurring superhuman abilities, super abilities acquired through science or magic (including extraterrestrials and gods), and even non- super powered humans using exotic technology, such as Iron Man, to register as \\"living weapons of mass destruction.\\" Enactment of the law on the federal level led to various revisions to state criminal codes (such as Chapter 40, Article 120, Section 120 of the New York Penal Code and Section 245(d) of the California Penal Code) in order to allow state and federal coordination in enforcing the law.Flamini, Anthony & Byrd, Ronald; Civil War Battle Damage Report; March 2007; Page 1 This leads to a major schism and conflict among the superheroes, with the anti-SHRA side- regarding the Act as a violation of civil liberties- led by Captain America and the pro-SHRA side- seeing the Act as a natural evolution of the superhuman's role in the modern world to regain public trust- led by Iron Man. Eventually, Iron Man's side wins the conflict and the \\"Fifty State Initiative\\" is established. Other countries followed America's lead and introduced their own Superhuman Registration laws. Following the Skrull invasion and the subsequent fall from grace of Iron Man, Norman Osborn seizes control of the Initiative and SHIELD, but is prevented from getting his hand on the register (and thus the identities of most of the superhuman community) by Tony Stark when he infects the US government database with a computer virus. There is only one copy of the SHRA database, in Stark's brain, where he deleted it, piece by piece, before Osborn could get his hands on it, destroying the very information that was the focus of \\"Civil War\\" in the first place. At the conclusion of Siege, Steve Rogers is named the new head of security of the United States and as a condition of joining, he convinces the government to repeal the Act, allowing superheroes to return to their prior activities. MI-13 Registration Act First raised in #1 and further detailed in #5 of Captain Britain and MI-13 (2008), the British version of registration was started during the Skrull invasion: all superheroes in the UK were drafted with immediate effect into the intelligence agency MI-13. After the invasion, the terms were stated that MI-13 would monitor and support superheroes and call on them for reasons of national defence, but would allow them semi-autonomy so they would not feel morally compromised.Captain Britain and MI-13 #5 =Underage Superhuman Welfare Act= Being first hinted at by Senator Geoffrey Patrick on television about problems caused by young vigilantes,Incoming #1. Marvel Comics in Outlawed (April 2020), the destruction of Coles Academic High School due to Viv's malfunction and the simultaneous/resulting nearby public's near death experience had the U.S. government draft the Underage Superhuman Welfare Act. The Act, which they nicknamed Kamala's Law due to Kamala's courageous actions during the event, outlawed superheroes below twenty-one years of age. The Act also leads to the creation of the Child-Hero Reconnaissance and Disruption Law Enforcement (C.R.A.D.L.E.), whose commanders would prevent young people from being superheroes.Outlawed #1. Marvel Comics The Act was supported by many superheroes such as Spider-Man (Peter Parker),Ghost-Spider Vol. 1 #8. Marv Comics, as well as parents of young superheroes.Miles Morales: Spider Man Vol. 1 #17. Marvel Comics =Marvel Media= Ultimate Universe Although no Registration Act exists in the Ultimate Marvel Universe, there are several laws in place that prohibit superhuman activity. Genetic modification of a human being is illegal, and the Superhuman Test Ban Treaty makes it illegal for nations to employ superhumans. This makes the Test Ban Treaty the polar opposite of the SHRA. In Ultimate Six #1, it was stated that the law on deliberately created superhumans is still unclear, allowing Nick Fury to hold supervillains indefinitely without any trial and in hidden locations (#5 showed that the President of the United States was unaware of this, and was furious when he learned of it). Exiles #12 In Exiles #12 a parallel world is shown, similar to the \\"Days of Future Past\\" timeline, in which the passing of a Mutant Registration Act led to the Sentinels taking over the world and herding mutants, superhumans and eventually even humans into concentration camps. The \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" version of Sabretooth, who at that point was a member of the Exiles, stays on this planet in order to raise the infant David Richards (the son of the Rachel Summers and Franklin Richards of that reality). Marvel Knights: 2099 In an alternate world (Earth-2992) shown in the Marvel Knights: 2099 series of one-shots published in November 2004, a Mutant Registration Act is in effect which mandates that mutants undergo a process which robs them of their abilities. The Marvel Knights: Mutant 2099 one-shot explained that after the passage of this act the Avengers, X-Men and Fantastic Four opposed the government's enforcement of it and were eventually defeated in a major battle that was fought in front of the Baxter Building. This led all the remaining superheroes to go underground. The 1992 X-Men animated series The first episode of the 1992 X-Men Animated Series (Night of the Sentinels (part 1); original airdate: 31 October 1992) mentions that some form of registration is in effect already. In the episode, Jubilee's foster parents worry that they may have to \\"register her with the Mutant Control Agency\\" after she manifests her powers for the first time. But following the attack on Jubilee at a mall, it was revealed that the hidden agenda of Henry Peter Gyrich, the founder of the agency is to deceive the mutants into revealing their identities so the Sentinels could track down and eliminate them due to Gyrich's beliefs that mutants pose a threat to society. After the destruction of their files, following the X-Men's raid on the agency, the President decides to cancel the registration act. The government's persecution of mutants is a consistent theme throughout the fifth season of the series. The X-Men movies The events of the first X-Men film are precipitated when Senator Robert Kelly introduces a Mutant Registration Act to the Senate. This motivates Magneto, who sees such legislation as persecutory towards mutants, to kidnap Kelly and replace him with Mystique, who while impersonating Kelly, withdraws his advocacy for the Act. In the sequel, X2, the Mutant Registration Act is briefly mentioned when Storm speculates that Nightcrawler's attack on the White House might lead the government to reintroduce the legislation. Marvel Cinematic Universe In Captain America: Civil War, which is loosely based on the 2006-2007 comics storyline \\"Civil War\\", public opinion of the Avengers and all superpowered beings worsens following the climactic battles of Marvel's The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, causing great destruction and casualties to New York, Washington D.C., and Sokovia respectively. The Inhuman Outbreak in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. makes the bigotry worse. After a catastrophe in Lagos, involving Scarlet Witch using her powers to divert an explosion from Crossbones, causing the accidental destruction of a building and the deaths of several humanitarian workers (some of them Wakandan), the United Nations begin trying to pass a set of internationally ratified legal documents that provide regulation and frame-working for the military/law enforcement deployment of enhanced individuals, particularly the Avengers, called the Sokovia Accords. The Accords divide the Avengers, leading Steve Rogers to come into conflict with Tony Stark, who believes the Avengers need to be held responsible for their actions, especially after he created Ultron and was responsible for the destruction in Sokovia, while Rogers believes the Accords will restrict the Avengers' freedom and therefore opposes it. In the meantime, Bucky Barnes is framed for a bombing at the UN by Colonel Helmut Zemo, who is using the Accords to his advantage against the Avengers, seeking vengeance for the deaths of his family in Sokovia. This leads to Rogers and Stark each forming their own sides as they battle over the Accords, ultimately resulting in a large-scale battle at the Leipzig/Halle Airport, with Stark, James Rhodes, Peter Parker, Natasha Romanoff, T'Challa and Vision against Rogers, Barnes, Sam Wilson, Clint Barton, Wanda Maximoff, and Scott Lang. The battle concludes with Rogers and Barnes escaping to a secret Hydra base in Siberia where Barnes had been kept and where they suspect Zemo will unleash five other Winter Soldiers. In the aftermath of the battle, Wilson, Maximoff, Barton and Lang are imprisoned at the Raft, while Romanoff goes on the run for helping Rogers and Barnes escape. At the end of the film, Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft, with Stark - who was appalled at how his former comrades were being treated when he assumed the Raft would only be used for actual criminals, not vigilantes - willingly letting the breakout occur without interference from his side. When Thaddeus Ross calls Stark to stop the breakout, he ignores it, pretending to be busy. T'Challa provides the anti- registration heroes (who are now wanted fugitives) with sanctuary in Wakanda after taking Zemo into custody. The Accords were mentioned in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season three episode \\"Emancipation\\" and have play through the show's fourth season. In Avengers: Infinity War, Ross still intends to prosecute Rogers and his team for violating the Accords, despite being aware of Zemo's actions and the threat Thanos poses to Earth. This alienates Rhodes (who now sees that the Accords have caused more harm than good), who hangs up on Ross instead of arresting the fugitives as ordered. Lang and Barton avoid prosecution by agreeing to the government's terms and taking a plea deal, explaining their absence in the film. In Ant-Man and the Wasp, Lang is placed under house arrest as part of his plea deal, while Hope van Dyne and her father Hank Pym are forced into hiding due to their technology being involved in the conflict. At the beginning of Avengers: Endgame, it is highly presumed that the Accords are no longer in effect when Romanoff mentions the world's governments to be in pieces as a result of Thanos wiping out half of all life in the universe. During the events of Endgame, the Accords wasn't mentioned after the five-year timeskip, seemingly leaving it inactive, forgotten, and renounced. The Accords most likely remains in this status even after Thanos's actions have been reversed. Avengers Assemble In Avengers: Ultron Revolution, two registration acts are enacted: \\"the New Powers Act\\" which puts all super powered beings under government jurisdiction and a variation of the Mutant Registration Act known as Inhumans Registration Act which puts all Inhumans under government control with Registration Disks on their necks. Both the \\"New Powers Act\\" and the Inhuman Registration Act, however, are revealed to be just a plot by Ultron (who was disguised as the Avengers' government liaison Truman Marsh) to accomplish his goals against both humans and Inhumans, also revealing that the Registration Disks are mind control devices. Marvel Future Avengers In a three-part story during the first season of the anime series Marvel Future Avengers, Norman Osborn uses a mind-altering gas as the Green Goblin to cause the Hulk to go on a rampage in New York City, stoking anti-superhero sentiment. Osborn uses this to gain support for a new superhero regulation bill, hoping to eliminate superheroes from society and allow him to sow chaos. The law passes, but several councilmen begin seeking its repeal, leading the Green Goblin to stage violent attacks on the bill's opponents. Ultimately, Spider-Man and the Future Avengers expose Osborn as the Green Goblin, and he is defeated and imprisoned, restoring the people's faith in heroes and leading to the law's repeal. DC Universe =DC Comics= In DC Comics, DC Universe the Justice Society of America chose to disband in 1951 rather than appear in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, which demanded that they unmask themselves. This was first shown in a back-up story in Adventure Comics (vol. 1) #466 (\\"The Defeat of the Justice Society!\\"; December 1979) by writer Paul Levitz and subsequently further explored in the America vs. The Justice Society 4 issue limited series (January‚ÄìApril 1985) by writers Roy and Dann Thomas. There is also a piece of legislation called the \\"Keene Act\\" (an apparent reference to Watchmen, see below) in the DC Universe. First mentioned in Suicide Squad (vol. 1) #1 (May 1987) in a story written by John Ostrander, the \\"Act\\" is referred to as a piece of legislation from 1961 which gives prisons greater leeway in imprisoning superhumans than ordinary prisoners. It was more fully explored in Secret Origins (vol. 3) #14 (May 1987), again written by Ostrander, where it is revealed that the Act was passed in 1961 and it reaffirmed the right (that had been cast into doubt by HUAC in 1951) of superheroes to operate with secret identities. That story also reveals that the later \\"Ingersoll Amendment\\" (a reference to lawyer and comics writer Bob Ingersoll) to the Keene Act, which delineates governmental authority over superhuman activity in times of crisis, was passed into law in 1972. Watchmen In Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 12 issue Watchmen series (September 1986 ‚Äì October 1987), extensive reference is made to a law called the Keene Act. The series reveals that the actions of superheroes or \\"costumed vigilantes\\" in the world of Watchmen caused a New York City police strike in 1977, which led to rioting (shown in Watchmen #2; October 1986) and the passing of the Keene Act which outlaws non-government affiliated acts of \\"costumed adventuring\\" (mentioned in Watchmen #4; December 1986). The passing of the act led to the retirement of most of the US superheroes, the sole exceptions being government-sponsored heroes such as The Comedian and Doctor Manhattan (who are used to fight wars, allowing the US to win the Vietnam War) and Rorschach, who refuses to abide by the law. The series depicts them coming out of retirement when The Comedian is murdered at the beginning of the comic. =DC Media= Smallville In the television series Smallville The Vigilante Registrations Act (VRA) is proposed legislation that would require vigilantes to register themselves. Led by General Slade Wilson, the VRA forces registered heroes to unmask and officially work for the government or be branded as terrorists. Despite the efforts of Darkseid and his minions to encourage anti-hero propaganda, the actions of the Justice League, Oliver Queen, and the pro-vigilante Senator Martha Kent ‚Äì ironically aided by an assassination attempt arranged against Martha by a clone of Lex Luthor, which was based around his personal grudges against her son rather than the VRA ‚Äì result in the Act being repealed and the heroes being permitted to return to their daily lives. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice In the film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the character of Superman becomes controversial due to the destruction he caused in Metropolis during Man of Steel. The government subsequently decides to have a court hearing that will decide if Superman should be held accountable via a registration act. Superman tries to avoid it, and instead focus on trying to locate Batman, who agrees with the government and desires to obtain kryptonite to use on him if necessary. Superman ultimately attends the hearing, but before a resolution can be made, Lex Luthor bombs the court. Other equivalents In many other super-hero universes the government has intervened to regulate or control the activities of super-heroes. Some examples of this include: =The Return of Captain Invincible= In the 1983 comedy film The Return of Captain Invincible starring Alan Arkin and Christopher Lee, Captain Invincible (Arkin) is a super-hero who was forced into retirement in the 1950s following the government's persecution of him. In a similar scenario as that faced by the Justice Society, Captain Invincible faced a McCarthy-ish congressional investigation which accused him of being a communist (because of his red cape) and charged him for violating U.S. airspace by flying without a proper license. As the title suggests a crisis forces Captain Invincible out of retirement in the 1980s which leads to him redeeming his reputation. =City of Heroes= Following World War II, in the City of Heroes universe, the United States intelligence community feared the Soviet bloc would gain an advantage in meta-human assets. To address this issue, the government passed the Might for Right Act. This law proclaimed any U.S. citizen with meta-human powers or paranormal abilities, super-powered individuals and vigilante heroes a valuable national resource subject to draft without notice into the service of the United States government. The law was later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court after numerous protests and complaints regarding the law's civil rights abuses. Currently in effect in the setting is the Citizen Crime Fighting Act, which provides vigilantes who choose to register (whether technically superhuman or not) with police powers. Unlike the Might for Right act or the Marvel act the CCFA does not require heroes to work for the government, although through various \\"forms\\" in the game it is shown the government (or at least the one in Paragon City) keeps track of all heroes and any supergroups they may form. Similar to Marvel's 2006 Act, in the alternate dimension Praetoria all superhumans are required to work under the \\"Powers Division\\" of the government. =Astro City= In writer Kurt Busiek's Astro City Vol. 2 #6-9 (February - May 1996) the registration of super-humans is mandated by the city's Mayor Stevenson. In those comic book issues, a super- human serial killer is thought to be active in the city and the Mayor proposes that registration will help apprehend the killer. Stevenson brings in federal E.A.G.L.E. agents to enforce the new requirement, which is opposed by many active super-heroes. The prominent hero Winged Victory makes outspoken statements opposing registration and several super-humans flout the law and illegally continue their activities without registration. In Astro City #8 the Mayor is revealed as an alien infiltrator whose actions are part of a planned extraterrestrial invasion. The mayor's policy discredited, Astro City's super- human population unite to defeat the invasion in Astro City #9. Registration is abandoned at the storyline's conclusion and has not been mentioned again in the series. The issues involved were later collected in the trade paperback Astro City: Confession (). =Brave New World= In the Brave New World superhero role-playing game originally released by Pinnacle Entertainment Group in 1999 the setting of a dystopian alternate timeline includes a fascist United States government which passed the \\"Delta Registration Act\\" after a group of supervillains attempted to assassinate President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. In the game the law requires that anybody with super-human abilities must register themselves to the United States Government. Its restrictive provisions include requirements that registrants surrender certain civil rights and notify the police of their whereabouts regularly. The law also mandates that super-powered individuals register within 7 days of first manifesting their abilities, with the penalty for failing to do so being an automatic sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Act also legislates for the mandatory military conscription of individual super-powered individuals at any time should their abilities be judged necessary by the government. In the world of the game most other nations have similar laws, though they are far less draconian in their restrictions and enforcement. =Powers= In Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Avon Oeming's Powers series, superheroes had to register with the government in order to be able to operate. This was changed following the events of Powers (vol. 1) #30 (March 2003) in which Super Shock, the world's most trusted superhero, goes on a massive worldwide killing spree. At that point, the US government prohibited super-beings from using their powers and operating as superheroes. This leads all the world's heroes to retire and attempt to live normal lives, though after Powers (vol. 2) #6 (November 2004) some begin to re-emerge. =The Incredibles and Incredibles 2= In the world depicted in the 2004 Pixar animated feature film The Incredibles, superheroes (known as \\"supers\\") are shown in flashbacks as originally having been required to register with the National Supers Agency (or \\"NSA\\"; a joke reference to the real-life National Security Agency) in order to legally fight the crime that mostly (and at many times constantly) occurred in their home city of Municiberg during the late 1940s and into the 50s. However, this would all be changed by the Sansweet v. Incredible court case near the start of the movie, as it revealed superheroes are legally liable for personal injury claims of the people who were injured, and eventually costs to the infrastructure and property that were damaged, during their activities. Despite all the important live-saving and crime- stopping those activities had and would provide for everyone, the superheroes ended up facing potentially overwhelming legal liabilities and public pressure from those who hated them for causing those injuries and damages, forcing them all into retirement before the end of the 1950s. To assist the superheroes with the retirement processes, the United States government set up a \\"Superhero Relocation Program\\" (similar in many ways to the non-fictional Witness Protection Program) which granted heroes amnesty from the legal claims provided they permanently retire from hero work and live anonymously. By the end of the film, in the Early 1960s (1962 according to a newspaper), the main protagonists have returned to their roles as superheroes (among the very few left as the result of the villainous Syndrome's actions), hinting that the program itself has been nullified. In the 2018 sequel, Incredibles 2, following the indeed-confirmed shutdown of the relocation program, a wealthy industrialist, Winston Deavor, recruits Helen Parr (Elastigirl and wife of Robert Parr, Mr. Incredible) to help him get supers legalized again. Although the effort is sabotaged by Deavor's own sister Evelyn, who blames supers for the cause of their father's death, near the end of the film, a judge is shown striking down the legislation outlawing superheroes. =Absolution= In the world depicted in Absolution, Christopher Gage's creator-owned limited series by Avatar Press, super heroes are part of the police force. While the government is aware of their real identities, superheroes are not obligated to reveal their identities to the public.

KIT Scientific Publishing, Nov 14, 2014. Pg. 250. is a general-purpose modeling language for systems engineering applications. It supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of systems and systems- of-systems. SysML was originally developed by an open source specification project, and includes an open source license for distribution and use. SysML is defined as an extension of a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) using UML's profile mechanism. The language's extensions were designed to support systems engineering activities.  Contrast with UML  SysML offers systems engineers several noteworthy improvements over UML, which tends to be software-centric. These improvements include the following: * SysML's semantics are more flexible and expressive. SysML reduces UML's software- centric restrictions and adds two new diagram types, requirement and parametric diagrams. The former can be used for requirements engineering; the latter can be used for performance analysis and quantitative analysis. Consequent to these enhancements, SysML is able to model a wide range of systems, which may include hardware, software, information, processes, personnel, and facilities. * SysML is a comparatively small language that is easier to learn and apply.Embedded Systems Security. By David Kleidermacher, Mike Kleidermacher. Elsevier, 2012. Pg 180. Since SysML removes many of UML's software-centric constructs, the overall language is smaller both in diagram types and total constructs. * SysML allocation tables support common kinds of allocations. Whereas UML provides only limited support for tabular notations, SysML furnishes flexible allocation tables that support requirements allocation, functional allocation, and structural allocation. This capability facilitates automated verification and validation (V&V;) and gap analysis. * SysML model management constructs support models, views, and viewpoints. These constructs extend UML's capabilities and are architecturally aligned with IEEE-Std-1471-2000 (IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software Intensive Systems). SysML reuses seven of UML 2's fourteen diagrams, and adds two diagrams (requirement and parametric diagrams) for a total of nine diagram types. SysML also supports allocation tables, a tabular format that can be dynamically derived from SysML allocation relationships. A table which compares SysML and UML 2 diagrams is available in the SysML FAQ. Consider modeling an automotive system: with SysML one can use Requirement diagrams to efficiently capture functional, performance, and interface requirements, whereas with UML one is subject to the limitations of use case diagrams to define high-level functional requirements. Likewise, with SysML one can use Parametric diagrams to precisely define performance and quantitative constraints like maximum acceleration, minimum curb weight, and total air conditioning capacity. UML provides no straightforward mechanism to capture this sort of essential performance and quantitative information. Concerning the rest of the automotive system, enhanced activity diagrams and state machine diagrams can be used to specify the embedded software control logic and information flows for the on-board automotive computers. Other SysML structural and behavioral diagrams can be used to model factories that build the automobiles, as well as the interfaces between the organizations that work in the factories.  History  The SysML initiative originated in a January 2001 decision by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) Model Driven Systems Design workgroup to customize the UML for systems engineering applications. Following this decision, INCOSE and the Object Management Group (OMG), which maintains the UML specification, jointly chartered the OMG Systems Engineering Domain Special Interest Group (SE DSIG) in July 2001. The SE DSIG, with support from INCOSE and the ISO AP 233 workgroup, developed the requirements for the modeling language, which were subsequently issued by the OMG parting in the UML for Systems Engineering Request for Proposal (UML for SE RFP; OMG document ad/03-03-41) in March 2003. In 2003 Cris Kobryn and Sanford Friedenthal organized and co-chaired the SysML Partners, an informal association of industry leaders and tool vendors, which initiated an open source specification project to develop the SysML in response to the UML for Systems Engineering RFP. The original technical contributors and co-authors of the SysML 1.0a specification were Laurent Balmelli, Conrad Bock, Rick Steiner, Alan Moore and Roger Burkhart. The SysML Partners distributed their first open source SysML specification drafts in 2004, and submitted SysML 1.0a to the OMG for technology adoption in November 2005. = OMG SysML = After a series of competing SysML specification proposals, a SysML Merge Team was proposed to the OMG in April 2006.OMG document ad/06-03-01 This proposal was voted upon and adopted by the OMG in July 2006 as OMG SysML, to differentiate it from the original open source specification from which it was derived. Because OMG SysML is derived from open source SysML, it also includes an open source license for distribution and use. The OMG SysML v. 1.0 specification was issued by the OMG as an Available Specification in September 2007. The current version of OMG SysML is v1.6, which was issued by the OMG in December 2019. In addition, SysML was published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 2017 as a full International Standard (IS), ISO/IEC 19514:2017 (Information technology -- Object management group systems modeling language). The OMG has been working on the next generation of SysML and issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for version 2 on December 8, 2017, following its open standardization process. The resulting specification, which will incorporate language enhancements from experience applying the language, will include a UML profile, a metamodel, and a mapping between the profile and metamodel. A second RFP for a SysML v2 Application Programming Interface (API) and Services RFP was issued in June 2018. Its aim is to enhance the interoperability of model-based systems engineering tools.  Diagrams  SysML includes 9 types of diagram, some of which are taken from UML. * Block definition diagram * Internal block diagram * Package diagram * Use case diagram * Requirement Diagram * Activity diagram * Sequence diagram * State machine diagram * Parametric diagram  Tools  There are several modeling tool vendors already offering SysML support, or are in the process of updating their tools to comply with the OMG SysML specification. Lists of tool vendors who support, or have announced support of, SysML or OMG SysML can be found on the SysML Forum or SysML websites, respectively. = Model exchange = As an OMG UML 2.0 profile, SysML models are designed to be exchanged using the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) standard. In addition, architectural alignment work is underway to support the ISO 10303 (also known as STEP, the Standard for the Exchange of Product model data) AP-233 standard for exchanging and sharing information between systems engineering software applications and tools.

She had a Fulbright fellowship to Japan in 1983. In 1982, while a staff writer at The Washington Post, she wrote a series of articles about a pattern of widespread gang rape inside a Prince George's County Maryland jail for which she won a 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting. The series was notable for its documentation: Tofani obtained the victims' medical records and interviewed the victims as well as the rapists. The victims were innocent, charged with drunk driving and shop lifting, in jail because they did not have enough money for bond. The jail placed them in the same cellblocks with convicted murderers and armed robbers, who raped them. The jail changed its policies as a result of her story.

As these games are offered as a download-only phone service in Japan, none of them has been made available outside Japan. Role-playing games = Tales of Tactics = is a tactical RPG similar to other turn-based tactical war games such as the Fire Emblem series. The game allows the player to take control of several characters from other Tales games and use their specific skills to battle enemies across several different boards. Among the recruitable characters are Cless Alvein from Tales of Phantasia, Judas, Kyle, Reala, and Loni from Tales of Destiny 2, Lloyd from Tales of Symphonia and Stahn from Tales of Destiny. In addition to the normal game, Tales of Tactics also features several additional features as downloadable content, such as a puzzle-based minigame, a picture and movie gallery from several games in the Tales series, and wallpapers. Also the newest release contains a playable demo for \\"Tales of Tales\\". =Tales of Breaker= is modeled closely after the conventional games of the Tales series. It plays like a typical role-playing video game, with the player advancing the plot by fulfilling a number of tasks given by non-playable characters and defeating several monsters along the way. The game uses the familiar Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS) that is featured in several other games in the series, which involves the characters moving horizontally across the battlefield, striking enemies only when they are close enough, with all the action happening in real-time. The maximum battle party number is two characters. This is the first of three Tales mobile games that contain their own original stories and characters. The story follows the adventures of a young girl named Mika, who, along with her companions Yuteki, Evelyn, Sauber, RuRu and Berger must travel the world in order to stop a rising evil from engulfing the land while slowly unraveling Mika's past. =Tales of Commons= is a role-playing game that takes place in the world of Yupitel, and stars main characters Alvin and Sefina, along with their party members, Seiun and You. Like Tales of Breaker, it utilizes a variation of the Linear Motion Battle System. It was the first Tales of Mobile game to contain a theme song: Kana Uemura's Kiseki. Tales of Commons's characteristic genre name is . This is the second of the Tales mobile titles that have their own stories and characters. During a perfectly ordinary journey, something very strange happened to a young man named Alvin, who was headed through a rainforest on the way to the hometown of his late mother. He suddenly hears singing from out of nowhere. He struggles on to the decayed ruins of a temple, and there he meets a young lady named Sefina, who is praying for something. Sephina is waiting for a natural Zilphixy (a small dragon-like being) to appear to her. In the past, a natural Zilphixy was created to fit a person upon their birth, but now a mechanical Zilphixy is used as a substitute. Sefina's wish is heard, and a Zilphixy appears in a flash of light. From there, Alvin and Sephina's story begins. =Tales of Wahrheit= is a role- playing game similar to Tales of Breaker and Tales of Commons. \\"Wahrheit\\" is the German word for \\"truth\\". Tales of Wahrheit's characteristic genre name is . The main characters of the game are 16-year-old Seltz Vakstrum and Vila Czarheit, and they are accompanied by Blitz Vinte, Kalulu von Atmigar, Gamut, and Ray Sonne. A theme song by JAMOSA feat. CORN HEAD called Ienaiyo (Japanese for \\"I won't tell\\") accompanies the game. This is the last of the three Tales mobile titles with their own self-contained stories and characters. There is also a separate game called Tales of Wahrheit Colosseum, which features tournament style battles using the Tales of Wahrheit battle system. Other games = Craymel Check = Craymel Check features characters known as \\"Craymels\\" (beings with considerable magical skill featured in several games in the Tales series) in a number of small mini-games. The artwork and character design of the craymels themselves are based on the ones from Tales of Eternia specifically. =Craymel Lab= Craymel Lab is a puzzle game that consists of the player moving falling blocks of different colors and shapes into an arrangement and making them disappear, similar in many ways to Tetris. Several character choices are available before the game begins, all of them being from a previous Tales game. Whichever character the player chooses determines what dialogue they will present as they play through the game's increasingly more difficult levels. =Groovy Arche= Groovy Arche is the same game featured in the PlayStation and PlayStation Portable remakes of Tales of Phantasia released only in Japan. The player must control the character Arche as she flies across a horizontally scrolling screen, moving up and down as well as side to side firing bolts of magic energy at enemies to defeat them. In each round, Arche can score more points by not only defeating a large number of monsters, but also by collecting several items that appear on the screen for a short amount of time. The game is over whenever Arche's health, indicated by the life bar on the top of the screen, is depleted. =Klondike= The Tales of the Mobile take on the traditional card game Klondike, a game similar to Solitaire that can be played by only one person. While playing the game, the Fairy character from Tales of Tactics offers her insight. =Mieu no Daibouken= is an action role-playing game starring Mieu, the mascot of Tales of the Abyss. A total of twelve dungeons are available to the player for download. =Reversi= Reversi is the Tales of Mobile version of the classic board game (also known as \\"Othello\\") that features characters from other Tales games playing against each other. Incidentally, Tales of Reversi, as part of a DVD special, was suggested as an actual game by Veigue Lungberg of Tales of Rebirth. =Scramble Land= Scramble Land is a card/board game that features characters from other Tales games playing against each other. =Tales of Quiz= Tales of Quiz is a quiz game with questions given by characters the Tales universe. Includes monthly updated questions and a national ranking for the player to participate in. =Tales of Wonder Casino= Tales of Wonder Casino features various minigames from casinos in the Tales series. =Whis Battle= Nearly identical to the minigame featured in Tales of Eternia, Whis Battle puts the player against other characters from that title in a card game. Each character takes turns playing a card from their hand onto the table, and only cards of the same color may be placed on one another. However, some cards are given two colors, and may be used to switch whichever card the next player must lay. If a player is unable to place a card, they must draw cards until they can play. The game ends when a player no longer has any cards in their hand. In addition to featuring the Whis Card Game, the game is accompanied by several small story sequences involving characters from Tales of Eternia itself.

Background Metal Forces was created in 1983 by Bernard Doe, with the first issue released in August 1983. Articles covered and promoted mainly bands that were relatively unknown at the time. Metal Forces aided greatly in promoting unknown bands and heavy metal and hard rock during the 1980s and early 1990s, becoming one of UK's top music magazines during that period. During the early 1990s, Metal Forces changed from their policy of balancing their articles between established and unknown bands, to a style which covered more mainstream and famed rock and heavy metal bands. The changes implemented were not profitable and the magazine lost readers and advertisers. In this period and for a brief time, Metal Forces launched the appreciated spin-off Thrash 'n Burn (later renamed Xtreme Noize). Metal Forces released seventy-two issues before rebranding under the abbreviated title of MF. The latter ceased publication in February 1993.

WJCL-FM is a 100,000 watt FM station which serves as the secondary Emergency Alert System radio station for the region. Its studios are located on Television Circle in Savannah and utilizes a transmitter located west of the city in unincorporated Chatham County. History The station was founded by J. Curtis Lewis, Jr., who operated the radio station in conjunction with WJCL-TV on the south side of Savannah, adjacent to his car dealership. The call letters are the founder's initials. Lewis, a former mayor of Savannah, sold the TV station in 1999 to Grapevine Communications. The current owner of the radio station is Cumulus Broadcasting. For most of its history, WJCL-FM featured easy listening music and was managed by Savannah broadcasting pioneer Al Jennings. Jennings not only managed the station, he was a frequent on-air presence, voicing numerous commercials, sports reports, and programs featuring big band music and nostalgia. A personal friend of Savannah native son Johnny Mercer, Jennings often paid tribute to the legendary songwriter with radio shows featuring unique insights and trivia. WJCL-FM was one of the first radio stations in the area to use an automation system to play music and commercials, following WEAS-FM's earlier attempts in the late 1960s, which were a failure. During morning and afternoon drive times, live announcers were used, and the easy listening format was expanded to include adult contemporary and light rock music. Other notable personalities on the station in its early years included Ben Mayo, host of an afternoon program called \\"Music with Mayo,\\" Joe Cox, famous to a generation of Savannahians as weatherman \\"Cap'n Sandy,\\" Charlie Solomons, who played drums in a local big band and featured big band music on his morning show, and Pete Preston, who was also a weathercaster on WJCL-TV. Morning and afternoon news updates were read by veteran local newscaster Richard Lantz. The station turned to country music in the early 1990s as KIX 96, later to be shortened to KIX 96. Notable DJs included Big Mac, Bill West, Tyler Morgan, Jay Scott, Boomer Lee, Mike Miller and Laura Anderson. The station was a powerhouse taking the country lead in the market as the other country station in Savannah, WCHY, (now known as WQBT) went into decline. The station was live assist for the majority of its existence. It became Nash-FM in 2013. On December 4, 2015 WJCL-FM dropped the \\"Nash FM\\" branding and reverted to its former \\"Kix 96\\" branding.WJCL Savannah Drops Nash Branding to Return to Kix Nash FM Nash FM logo from 2013-2015 References External links *WJCL official website * Category:Country radio stations in the United States JCL-FM Category:Radio stations established in 1980 Category:Cumulus Media radio stations ","title":"WJCL-FM"},{"id":"4883129","text":"Possible writings Ruri can be written using different kanji characters and can mean * truly *genuine *Áë†ÁíÉ, \\"lapis lazuli\\" *ÁêâÁíÉ, \\"lapis lazuli\\" ;as a given name *Áë†ÁíÉ, \\"lapis lazuli\\" *ÊµÅÁêÜ, \\"current/flow, logic\\" *ÁïôËéâ, \\"detain, jasmine\\" *Áë†Èáå, \\"lapis lazuli, home Real people ;with the given name Ruri *Ruri Mizutani (ÂÖâÈáå), a member of the Japanese music group Bon-Bon Blanco *R√∫r√≠, Icelandic artist Fictional characters ;with the name Ruri * Ruri (Dr. Stone), a character in the manga series Dr. Stone *Hojo no Ruri („É´„É™), a character in the manga series Onmy≈ç Taisenki *Ruri, a character in the PS2 video game Eureka Seven vol. 2: New Vision *Ruri (Áë†ÁíÉ), the main character in the Japanese PS2 video game Ururun Quest: Koiyuuki *Ruri Gok≈ç (Áë†ÁíÉ), a character in the manga and anime series Oreimo *Ruri Himeyuri (Áë†ÁíÉ), a character in the anime series To Heart 2 *Ruri Hoshino („É´„É™), a character in the anime series Martian Successor Nadesico *Ruri Mihashi (Áë†Èáå), a character in the baseball manga series Big Windup! *Ruri Saiki (Áø†ÈõÄ), a character in the manga and anime series Angel Sanctuary *Ruri Saionji (Áë†ÁíÉ), a character in the manga series Hot Gimmick *Ruri Sarasa („É´„É™), the main protagonist of the manga series Tokyo Underground *Ruri Kurosaki (Áë†ÁíÉ), a character in the anime series Yu-Gi-Oh!

This result was first proved by Otto H√∂lder in 1887; several alternative proofs have subsequently been found. Bank, Steven B. & Kaufman, Robert. ‚ÄúA Note on H√∂lder‚Äôs Theorem Concerning the Gamma Function‚Äù, Mathematische Annalen, vol 232, 1978. The theorem also generalizes to the q -gamma function. Statement of the theorem For every n \\\\in \\\\N_0, there is no non-zero polynomial P \\\\in \\\\Complex [X;Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}] such that :\\\\forall z \\\\in \\\\Complex \\\\setminus \\\\Z _{\\\\leq 0}: \\\\qquad P \\\\left( z;\\\\Gamma(z),\\\\Gamma'(z),\\\\ldots,{\\\\Gamma^{(n)}}(z) \\\\right) = 0, where \\\\Gamma is the gamma function. \\\\quad \\\\blacksquare For example, define P \\\\in \\\\Complex [X;Y_{0},Y_{1},Y_{2}] by : P ~ \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{df}}{=} X^{2} Y_{2} + X Y_{1} + (X^{2} - u^{2}) Y_{0}. Then the equation :P \\\\left (z;f(z),f'(z),f(z) \\\\right ) = z^2 f(z) + z f'(z) + \\\\left (z^2 - u^{2} \\\\right ) f(z) \\\\equiv 0 is called an algebraic differential equation, which, in this case, has the solutions f = J_{ u} and f = Y_{ u} ‚Äî the Bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively. Hence, we say that J_{ u} and Y_{ u} are differentially algebraic (also algebraically transcendental). Most of the familiar special functions of mathematical physics are differentially algebraic. All algebraic combinations of differentially algebraic functions are differentially algebraic. Furthermore, all compositions of differentially algebraic functions are differentially algebraic. H√∂lder‚Äôs Theorem simply states that the gamma function, \\\\Gamma , is not differentially algebraic and is therefore transcendentally transcendental. Proof Let n \\\\in \\\\N_0, and assume that a non-zero polynomial P \\\\in \\\\Complex [X;Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}] exists such that :\\\\forall z \\\\in \\\\Complex \\\\setminus \\\\Z _{\\\\leq 0}: \\\\qquad P \\\\left( z;\\\\Gamma(z),\\\\Gamma'(z),\\\\ldots,{\\\\Gamma^{(n)}}(z) \\\\right) = 0. As a non- zero polynomial in \\\\Complex [X] can never give rise to the zero function on any non-empty open domain of \\\\Complex (by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra), we may suppose, without loss of generality, that P contains a monomial term having a non-zero power of one of the indeterminates Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n} . Assume also that P has the lowest possible overall degree with respect to the lexicographic ordering Y_0 < Y_1 < \\\\ldots < Y_{n} < X. For example, :\\\\deg \\\\left(-3 X^{10} Y_{0}^{2} Y_{1}^{4} + i X^{2}Y_{2} \\\\right) < \\\\deg \\\\left( 2 X Y_{0}^{3} - Y_{1}^{4} \\\\right) because the highest power of Y_{0} in any monomial term of the first polynomial is smaller than that of the second polynomial. Next, observe that for all z \\\\in \\\\Complex \\\\setminus \\\\Z _{\\\\leq 0} we have: :\\\\begin{align} P \\\\left(z + 1; \\\\Gamma(z + 1), \\\\Gamma'(z + 1), \\\\Gamma(z + 1),\\\\ldots, \\\\Gamma^{(n)}(z + 1) \\\\right) &= P \\\\left(z + 1;z \\\\Gamma(z), [z \\\\Gamma(z)]',[z \\\\Gamma(z)],\\\\ldots,[z \\\\Gamma(z)]^{(n)} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= P \\\\left(z + 1;z \\\\Gamma(z), z \\\\Gamma'(z) + \\\\Gamma(z),z \\\\Gamma(z) + 2\\\\Gamma'(z),\\\\ldots, z {\\\\Gamma^{(n)}}(z) + n {\\\\Gamma^{(n - 1)}}(z) \\\\right). \\\\end{align} If we define a second polynomial Q \\\\in \\\\Complex [X;Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}] by the transformation :Q \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{df}}{=} ~ P(X + 1;X Y_{0},X Y_{1} + Y_{0},X Y_{2} + 2 Y_{1},\\\\ldots,X Y_{n} + n Y_{n - 1}), then we obtain the following algebraic differential equation for \\\\Gamma : :\\\\forall z \\\\in \\\\Complex \\\\setminus \\\\Z _{\\\\leq 0}: \\\\qquad Q \\\\left( z;\\\\Gamma(z),\\\\Gamma'(z),\\\\ldots,{\\\\Gamma^{(n)}}(z) \\\\right) \\\\equiv 0. Furthermore, if X^{h} Y_{0}^{h_{0}} Y_{1}^{h_{1}} \\\\cdots Y_{n}^{h_{n}} is the highest-degree monomial term in P , then the highest- degree monomial term in Q is : X^{h + h_{0} + h_{1} + \\\\cdots + h_{n}} Y_{0}^{h_{0}} Y_{1}^{h_{1}} \\\\cdots Y_{n}^{h_{n}}. Consequently, the polynomial :Q - X^{h_{0} + h_{1} + \\\\cdots + h_{n}} P has a smaller overall degree than P , and as it clearly gives rise to an algebraic differential equation for \\\\Gamma , it must be the zero polynomial by the minimality assumption on P. Hence, defining R \\\\in \\\\Complex[X] by : R \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{df}}{=} X^{h_{0} + h_{1} + \\\\cdots + h_{n}}, we get :Q= P(X + 1;X Y_{0},X Y_{1} + Y_{0},X Y_{2} + 2Y_{1},\\\\ldots,X Y_{n} + n Y_{n-1})= R(X) \\\\cdot P(X;Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}). Now, let X = 0 in Q to obtain :Q(0;Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}) = P(1;0,Y_{0},2 Y_{1},\\\\ldots,n Y_{n-1}) = R(0) \\\\cdot P(0;Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}) = 0_{\\\\Complex [Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}]}. A change of variables then yields : P(1;0,Y_{1},Y_{2},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}) = 0_{\\\\Complex [Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}]}, and an application of mathematical induction (along with a change of variables at each induction step) to the earlier expression :P(X + 1;X Y_{0},X Y_{1} + Y_{0},X Y_{2} + 2Y_{1},\\\\ldots,X Y_{n} + nY_{n-1})= R(X) \\\\cdot P(X;Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}) reveals that :\\\\forall m \\\\in \\\\N: \\\\qquad P(m;0,Y_{1},Y_{2},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}) = 0_{\\\\Complex [Y_{0},Y_{1},\\\\ldots,Y_{n}]}. This is possible only if P is divisible by Y_{0} , which contradicts the minimality assumption on P . Therefore, no such P exists, and so \\\\Gamma is not differentially algebraic.

Biography He was distinguished even in his youth for his scholarship and his oratorical gifts. He was associated, both as rabbi and as writer, with his father, after whose death, in 1565, he was elected rabbi at Venice. He had many pupils, one of whom had a bust made of his beloved teacher, who was of imposing appearance, and set it up in the schoolhouse so as to have it constantly before his eyes (Eisenstadt-Wiener, Da'at Kedoshim, p. 82, St. Petersburg, 1897‚Äì98). Chaim Yosef David Azulai (\\"Shem ha-Gedolim,\\" s.v.) speaks of this fact in connection with Samuel Judah Katzenellenbogen's great-grandfather, Judah Minz. Katzenellenbogen was highly respected by his coreligionists throughout Italy, and, because of his wide scholarship, was honored by Joseph Karo, Solomon Luria, and Moses Isserles. Non-Jews also esteemed him highly: Paul Weidner, a converted Jew, dedicated his works to him. He is said to have accorded a hospitable reception to the Polish prince Miko≈Çaj Krzysztof \\"the Orphan\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç when the latter visited Padua. When the prince found himself in need of money he appealed to Katzenellenbogen, who lent him the necessary funds for continuing his journey, requesting in return that he deal leniently with the Jews in his country, and protect them against the accusation of ritual murder. On Katzenellenbogen's death Leo Modena delivered the funeral oration, which has been printed in the Mivchar Yehudah (p. 63b). Samuel left one son, who is known under the name of Saul Wahl. Katzenellenbogen is the author of several responsa, which are included in the responsa collection of Moses Isserles (Nos. 23, 126, 127, 129) and in that of Samuel Kala'i; and of twelve derashot, published by his pupil (Venice, 1594; reprinted Lemberg, 1811, where the author's name is erroneously given as J. Minz). Katzenellenbogen also contributed some of the notes to the annotated edition of Maimonides' Yad ha-HazaKah (Venice, 1550), which notes Azulai (Shem ha-Gedolim, s.v.) ascribes to Meir of Padua.

Set in Rome and Germania during AD 71, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The iron in the title refers to the standard, shaped like a giant hand made of iron, which Falco is required to deliver to the imperial legions in Germany. Plot summary Following the events of Venus in Copper, the Imperial authorities are seeking Falco out for an assignment in Germany (which given the events of his last mission abroad, Falco is slow to accept). Meanwhile, Falco is not pleased with Titus Caesar attempting to seduce Helena. When Helena gets an invitation to a private dinner with Titus, she pleads that Falco stay by her side on the same day, but he instead decides to see a client in Veii -- who unfortunately turns out to be a widow more intent on pleasure than business. Disgusted, Falco returns to Rome, but Helena has disappeared, apparently leaving Falco for good. Romantically depressed, Falco goes over to the Palatine to be personally briefed by the emperor Vespasian on his latest assignment -- broker peace between Rome and the Celtic tribes of Germany (whose leaders are thought to be Veleda, a priestess and Julius Civilis, a local strongman), locate a missing military officer named Munius Lupercus, and deliver a new standard in the form of a two-foot long human hand, cast in iron, to the 14th Gemina at Moguntiacum -- the last actually being a pretext for Falco to investigate them, given that the 14th's loyalty is held in doubt. Much to Falco's annoyance, he is also to escort an ex-slave named Xanthus into Germany as well, whose specialty is hairdressing. Falco's trip is marked by a number of misadventures -- poor food and even poorer wine, unscrupulous souvenir sellers and cramped conditions, as well as murder. At Lugdunum, Falco and Xanthus bump into two travellers quarrelling with a group of potters, who are later found murdered. At the crime scene, Falco makes the acquaintance of a centurion named Helvetius, before trying to contact Helena's brother Justinus, a military tribune serving at Argentoratum, but discovers that Justinus has been transferred elsewhere, and so proceeds down the Rhenus further into Germany, where the relatively wealthy Xanthus is accosted by a peddler named Dubnus. Falco discovers that Dubnus is selling curios which may have been relics of Varus' ill-fated expedition, and asks Dubnus about Veleda, who tells him that she lives in a tower in the middle of the forest somewhere in the north. At Moguntiacum, Falco tries to contact the local military legate, Florius Gracilis, but discovers that like Lupercus, Gracilis is missing. Falco finally meets Justinus and upon discussing Gracilis further, he discovers that Gracilis has been absent without leave, and his whereabouts are unknown, and in addition to his official duties, begins tracking down Gracilis. Running out of leads, Falco finally tries to make enquiries with the camp prefect of the 14th Legion, but accidentally lets it slip that he was part of the infamous 2nd Augusta. Brusquely driven off and humiliated, he is warned by to cease his inquiries. Later, three apparently drunk soldiers attack Falco, but he is saved by Xanthus who kills one of the soldiers, and finally discovers that Justinus has another guest, and it's none other than Helena, who has also brought along his niece, Augustinilla, because her mother, Victorina, is having \\"woman problems\\". Falco and Helena go shopping and meet a German potter, Julius Mordanticus, whose uncle Bruccius has gone missing along with his cousin in Gaul. Falco immediately identifies Mordanticus' relatives as the men killed in Gaul, and tells Mordanticus to contact Helvetius, while Helena uncovers strong business rivalry between the potters of Lugdunum and Moguntiacum over commercial contracts to supply high- quality ceramics to the Roman army -- suggesting that Gracilis himself was bribed by Lugdunum. Helena then buys a bowl from Julius Mordanticus for Falco to bring back as a gift for his mother in Rome. Eventually, Falco goes north with Justinus, Dubnus, Helvetius and twenty young recruits from the 1st Aduitrix, another legion present in Moguntiacum, in search of Civilis and Veleda, but is captured by the Bructeri along with Helvetius and the twenty other soldiers. He manages to meet Veleda and tries to convince her that Vespasian wants to make peace, but Veleda refuses to listen to him. Just as things begin to look bleak, however, Justinus rides in and speaks with Veleda in Celtic, offering himself up as a hostage in return for the safe passage of Falco and his team back to civilisation. Veleda agrees and gives Falco a silver token taken from Lupercus' body. Apparently, Lupercus was murdered en route to Veleda. She asks Falco and Helvetius to use a galley captured from Petillius Cerialis (now decrepit from neglect) to escape so as to throw off the tribesmen's suspicion -- she must not be seen aiding the Romans. Justinus shortly after manages to rejoin the men, and tells Falco and Helvetius that Veleda does not wish for further war with Rome, and they take off in Cerialis' galley. Unfortunately, the galley is in poor shape and Falco and the men are soon shipwrecked in the lands of the Tencteri, a staunchly anti-Roman tribe, where they encounter the 14th Gemina's legate, Florius Gracilis, hunting for aurochs with the Gauls of Lugdunum, who then kill Helvetius. Gracilis and his followers soon decide to kill the survivors as well because they know too much, but Gracilis is gored to death by an aurochs, and Falco banishes the survivors of Gracilis' party. The Tencteri then attack Falco's party, but they are saved by the arrival of the 14th Gemina. One last job remains to be solved -- finding Civilis. Fortunately for Falco, his formidable niece Augustinilla managed to track down Civilis in Augusta Treverorum, and Falco goes to meet him, only to discover that Civilis is now an aged and broken man. Realising his time is up, Civilis agrees to accept Roman parole (as well as a new haircut from Xanthus!) Xanthus joins Civilis to start a new life as a freedman in Germany (although Falco now suspects that Xanthus was an Imperial agent meant to watch over Civilis). Back in Moguntiacum, a military parade is held to commemorate Vespasian's birthday, and the Iron Hand is officially handed over to the 14th Gemina. During the ceremony, Falco decides that Helena ought to marry Titus, but she asserts that she is staying put at Falco's side, and even writes the official report on the mission for Falco!

Set in Rome and Britannia during AD 70, just after the year of the four emperors, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The book's title refers to 200-pound lead ingots \\"pigs\\" filled with silver ore and stolen from Roman Britain, which feature prominently in the plot. Plot summary This first novel in the Marcus Didius Falco Mysteries series introduces the main characters as well as establishes relationships that continue and grow throughout the series. Falco stumbles upon a conspiracy in the trading of silver ingots, but not before it claims the life of a young girl (Sosia Camillina) Falco meets and is smitten with. Hired by Sosia's uncle, a senator, to find out who murdered her and by the Roman Emperor Vespasian, to uncover the conspiracy, Falco finds himself on the next boat to Britain. Once there he meets a lady way out of his class, Helena Justina, the daughter of the Senator who hired him, and Sosia's cousin. At first sight Falco and Helena loathe each other: He hates her class, and she hates his prejudice. Things are made no easier by Sosia's death, especially for Helena. Working under cover, Falco himself working down a silver mine, acting as a mine slave, Falco learns the meaning of hate, pain and abuse. After being rescued by Helena and a friendly centurion, Falco heads back to Rome, as the reluctant charge of the even more reluctant Helena. After spending so much time together, and many arguments, misunderstandings and denials, Falco and Helena fall in love (and subsequently consummate this in a horse stable, in a public garden). Eventually, Falco sorts out the case and only has to bring the culprits to justice. However, there is no justice, as one of the culprits is Domitian, the Emperor's wayward son, and the only other surviving culprit is very close to Helena and her senator father. After a final, bloody, retribution is carried out in the climax, Falco is offered a promotion to the equestrian rank. As an equestrian Falco would be upper middle class and could marry Helena without bringing her or her family shame, as would with his current meagre earnings. He refuses, seeing the offer as a bribe to keep the conspiracy hushed-up. After realizing his mistake and how he must have insulted Helena, he returns to Vespasian and asks for the chance again, and while he is told that his name can be added to the equestrian lists, he must first raise the 400,000 sesterces himself in order to purchase the land of that value, which is the qualification for equestrian status. Vespasian came from an equestrian family that rose into the senatorial rank under the Julio‚ÄìClaudian emperors, and although he fulfilled the standard succession of public offices, he had really made his name and earned his power in military service. Dejected, Falco returns to his dilapidated tenement in the Aventine Hill and there finds Helena waiting for him. She promises to wait for him for as long as it takes.

It aimed to remove archaic language and impenetrable terminology from tax law and to replace it with modern language and terminology.  History  The project was set up in 1996 and produced five pieces of primary legislation and one piece of secondary legislation. A sixth and seventh bill went before Parliament. The project focussed purely on primary legislation but special dispensation was given to the re-writing of the regulations governing PAYE by the project. The project began its work with the legislation covering capital allowances and the first legislation passed thanks to the project was the Capital Allowances Act 2001. The project then moved on to consider income tax. Three pieces of primary legislation relating to income tax‚Äîthe Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 and the Income Tax Act 2007‚Äîhave been passed by Parliament. Their main change is to remove the concept of schedules from British income tax law. Previously income was assessed in one of six schedules (labelled from A through to F) depending on its source. The schedules have been replaced with everyday terminology. For example, Schedule A income is now referred to as property income and Schedule E income is now referred to as employment income. It was felt that in addition to the primary legislation necessary for the project that one piece of secondary legislation would need to be rewritten. The PAYE system is intimately linked with income tax in British law and consequently the legislation governing it was dealt with by the project. The result was the Income Tax (PAYE) Regulations 2003. Following the passage of the Income Tax Act 2007 attention was turned to corporation tax. The Corporation Tax Act 2009 applies to accounting periods ending on or after 1 April 2009. Two further bills were enacted in 2010 ‚Äì the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010. Once these bills were enacted the Tax Law Rewrite Project was disbanded in April 2010 ‚Äì see ICAEW report. The legislation was scrutinized by the Joint Committee on Tax Law Rewrite Bills.

The name Nqwebasaurus is derived from the Xhosa word \\"Nqweba\\" which is the local name for the Kirkwood district, and \\"thwazi\\" is ancient Xhosa for lightning. Currently it is the only named coelurosaur discovered in Africa and shows that basal coelurosaurian dinosaurs inhabited Gondwana 50 million years earlier than previously thought. The type specimen of Nqwebasaurus was discovered by William J. de Klerk who is affiliated with the Albany Museum in Grahamstown. It is the only fossil of its species found to date and was found in the Kirkwood Formation of the Uitenhage Group. Nqwebasaurus has the unofficial nickname \\"Kirky\\", due to being found in the Kirkwood.  History of discovery  Nqwebasaurus was first discovered by William J. de Klerk and Callum Ross in July 1996 during a joint expedition lead by the Albany Museum in Grahamstown and Stony Brook in New York, United States, where Callum Ross was affiliated at the time. The fossil is remarkably complete and is considered an extremely rare find as no coelurosaur fossils had previously been found in Africa at this time. No new Nqwebasaurus fossils have been discovered since.  Description  Size comparison Nqwebasaurus is considered to have been a small to medium-sized ornithomimosaur. The type specimen is approximately 30 cm (1 ft) high and is estimated to have been 90 cm (3 ft) long, although its complete length is not known due to the caudal vertebrae of the type specimen being incomplete. In addition the type specimen is thought to be a late juvenile, although with the type specimen being the only fossil representing its species it is currently not possible to compare the fossil with another member of its species. Nqwebasaurus has a long, three-fingered hand which includes a partially opposable thumb with a recurved claw. The claws on its hands differ in shape where the claws of the first and second digits are recurved and the third claw is not. This trait is unusual in theropod dinosaurs, however, it has been observed in some ornithomimosaurs such as Struthiomimus. Nqwebasaurus also lacks serrations on its maxillary teeth, has a reduced dentition, and contains gastroliths in its abdominal cavity. Again this is unusual trait for carnivorous theropod dinosaurs as gastroliths are more commonly found in herbivorous vertebrates and modern ostriches. Due to these morphological traits, Nqwebasaurus is thought to have been a herbivore. It is not known conclusively whether Nqwebasaurus had feathers. However, as more basal theropod species, especially those on the evolutionary line to birds, had feathers it is accepted that Nqwebasaurus was likely at least partially feathered or had a feather coat for thermoregulation.  Classification  More recent phylogenetic analyses that include Nqwebasaurus support its current position as the basalmost member of Ornithomimosauria, one of the most basal clades of Coelurosauria, and the sister taxon of Maniraptora. However, new fossil material of coelurosaurs from the Early Cretaceous of Gondwana is much needed in order to gain a further understanding of Gondwanan coelurosaur phylogeny. The cladogram below follows an analysis by Yuong-Nam Lee, Rinchen Barsbold, Philip J. Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang- Jae Lee, Pascal Godefroit, Fran√ßois Escuilli√© & Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. The analysis was published in 2014, and displays the current phylogenetic position of Nqwebasaurus.

Ruderman accepted the position on the condition that he be permitted to open a yeshiva using the synagogue's facilities. He began with six students and named the newly formed yeshiva Ner Yisroel (after Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter,Sefer HaYovel - HaPardes. Jubilee Book HaPardes - Rabbinical monthly journal, pg. 397.

The yeshiva grew quickly, and Ruderman approached the renowned Rabbi Shimon Schwab, at the time rabbi of another Baltimore congregation, and invited him to join the faculty. Rabbi Schwab taught the first-year shiur (class) in Ner Israel for several years, until he moved to Washington Heights. When Ruderman grew old, he became legally blind but could still read by holding a book within inches of his eyes that wore very thick glasses. He still held a siddur when davening. Ruderman led the yeshiva for 54 years until his death when Rabbi Shmuel Yaakov Weinberg, his son in law, took over.http://matzav.com/rebbetzin-chana-weinberg-ah Ruderman was rosh yeshiva, while his brother-in-law, Rabbi Naftoli (Herman) Neuberger took care of the financial side.

Ruderman was also involved in many aspects of Jewish communal life outside of the Yeshiva. He was a member of the Council of Torah Sages of Agudath Israel and the chairman of the Rabbinic Advisory Board of Torah Umesorah. =Works= Around 1926, Ruderman published his only written work, Avodas Levi.

It is connected to ganga and ravne pjesme, which are also characteristic for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The root of the music is unknown, but some characteristics, like different temperament from the standard music, suggest it is an old type of music. Songs The songs are about all kinds of things from being a \\"lola\\" and \\"baraba\\", about love of a woman, having a good life, but also about sad things like mostly the war in Bosnia, or the nostalgia that expatriates experience about their home country. More recently Bosnian root music has - in a humorous way - concentrated on some facets of the modern way of life, like the widespread use of Facebook and smartphones. Bosnian Root Music groups and singers The most popular groups in Bosnia right now are \\"Raspjevane Meraklije\\", \\"Mara i lole\\", and the brothers Begic. The music has proven to be a way for former enemies to become friends again. Root music is popular with Serbs as well as Bosniaks, but also with Croats from Usora, ≈Ωepƒçe and Posavina.

The first singer starts the song, and after some number of syllables the other joins in. Intervals used in this type of singing are minor and major second, which is characteristic for most of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian music, and some parts of Croatia. Range of the songs is usually very narrow, consisting of only few tones. The two singers differ in the use of ornaments, so usually the first one who started the song uses vibrato and trill while he is singing alone, and when the other joins in he uses no ornaments, while the other uses a lot of trill, which are produced from throat giving the overall performance its characteristic detuned nature.

It courses south to north from the Lower Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain, a distance of approximately . The avenue intersects with Interstate 610, Interstate 10, and U.S. Highway 90, Gentilly Boulevard passing by Brother Martin High School. The part between North Claiborne Avenue (Louisiana Highway 39) and Gentilly Boulevard (U.S. Route 90) is Louisiana Highway 3021 (LA 3021); the piece from N. Claiborne Avenue south to St. Claude Avenue carries Louisiana Highway 46 (which turns east on St. Claude Avenue). For more than half of its route, from the river to Gentilly Boulevard (U.S. Route 90), it is six lanes wide; the remainder north of Gentilly Boulevard is four lanes wide. Anchoring the lake end and river end (northern and southern termini) respectively are the University of New Orleans and the Esplanade Avenue Wharf. The location of Elysian Fields Avenue originated in the early 19th century placement of a sawmill canal on the Marigny Plantation, which at that time was just outside New Orleans proper (the present French Quarter). In 1831 the Pontchartrain Railroad was built from that location straight to Lake Pontchartrain. The railroad carried both goods and passengers. Among the railroad's steady revenue sources was mail, which was carried from New Orleans to Lake Pontchartain for transfer to Mobile, Alabama-bound ships. The railroad, which came to be known locally as \\"Smoky Mary\\", operated until 1935. The tracks were removed in the 1950s. Lakeshore Drive At the end of Elysian Fields where it meets the lake. Lakeshore Drive runs along the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain. It is a recreational park space along the lake used for sun bathing, running, swimming (Swimming is allowed only by the Seabrook Bridge and you can only swim to a certain point), fishing and crabbing on the seawall steps, and leisurely walks, etc. This space is used mostly by locals and residents of New Orleans.

The \\"Photostat\\" name, which was originally a trademark of the company, became genericized, and was often used to refer to similar machines produced by the Rectigraph Company. History Commercial Camera Company Photostat advertisement in Engineering News, 1913. Commercial Camera Company Photostat advertisement in American Machinist, 1920. =Background= The growth of business during the industrial revolution created the need for a more efficient means of transcription than hand copying. Carbon paper was first used in the early 19th century. By the late 1840s copying presses were used to copy outgoing correspondence. One by one, other methods appeared. These included the \\"manifold writer,\\" developed from Christoph Scheiner's pantograph and used by Mark Twain; copying baths; copying books; and roller copiers. Among the most significant of them was the Blue process in the early 1870s, which was mainly used to make blueprints of architectural and engineering drawings. Stencil duplicators (more commonly known as \\"Mimeograph machines\\") surfaced in 1874, and the Cyclostyle in 1891. All were manual and most involved messy fluids. =Rectigraph and Photostat machines= George C. Beidler of Oklahoma City founded the Rectigraph Company in 1906 or 1907, producing the first photographic copying machines; he later moved the company to Rochester, New York in 1909 to be closer to the Haloid Company, his main source of photographic paper and chemicals. The Rectigraph Company was acquired by the Haloid Company in 1935. In 1948 Haloid purchased the rights to produce Chester Carlson's xerographic equipment and in 1958 the firm was reorganized to Haloid Xerox, Inc., which in 1961 was renamed Xerox Corporation. Haloid continued selling Rectigraph machines into the 1960s. The Photostat brand machine, differing in operation from the Rectigraph but with the same purpose of the photographic copying of documents, was invented in Kansas City by Oscar T. Gregory in 1907. A directory of the city from 1909 shows his \\"Gregory Commercial Camera Company\\". By 1910, Gregory had co-filed a patent application with Norman W. Carkhuff, of the photography department of the United States Geological Survey, for a specific type of photographic camera, for quickly and easily photographing small objects, with a further object \\"to provide a camera of the type known as 'copying cameras' that will be simple and convenient [...]\\" In 1911, the Commercial Camera Company of Providence, Rhode Island, was formed. By 1912, Photostat brand machines were in use, as evidenced by a record of one at the New York Public Library. By 1913, advertisements described the Commercial Camera Company as headquartered at Rochester and with a licensing and manufacturing relationship with Eastman Kodak. The pair filed another U.S. patent application in 1913 further developing their ideas. By 1920, distribution agency in various European markets was by the Alfred Herbert companies. The Commercial Camera Company apparently became the Photostat Corporation around 1921, for \\"Commercial Camera Company\\" is described as a former name of Photostat Corporation in a 1922 issue of Patent and Trade Mark Review. For at least 40 years the brand was widespread enough that its name was genericized by the public. The Photostat Corporation was eventually absorbed by Itek in 1963. Description Both Rectigraph and Photostat machines consisted of a large camera that photographed documents or papers and exposed an image directly onto rolls of sensitized photographic paper that were about long. A prism was placed in front of the lens to reverse the image. After a 10-second exposure, the paper was directed to developing and fixing baths, then either air- or machine- dried. Since the print was directly exposed, without the use of an intermediate film, the result was a negative print. A typical typewritten document would appear on the photostat print with a black background and white letters. Thanks to the prism, the text would remain legible. Producing photostats took about two minutes in total. The result could, in turn, be photostated again to make any number of positive prints. The photographic prints produced by such machines are commonly referred to as \\"photostats\\". The verbs \\"photostat\\", \\"photostatted\\", and \\"photostatting\\" refer to making copies on such a machine in the same way that the trademarked name \\"Xerox\\" was later used to refer to any copy made by means of electrostatic photocopying. People who operated these machines were known as photostat operators. It was the expense and inconvenience of photostats that drove Chester Carlson to study electrophotography. In the mid-1940s Carlson sold the rights to his inventionwhich became known as xerographyto the Haloid Company and photostatting soon sank into history.

It is the only species in the genus Phaeodactylum. Unlike other diatoms P. tricornutum can exist in different morphotypes (fusiform, triradiate, and oval), and changes in cell shape can be stimulated by environmental conditions. This feature can be used to explore the molecular basis of cell shape control and morphogenesis. Unlike most diatoms P. tricornutum can grow in the absence of silicon, and it can survive without making silicified frustules. This provides opportunities for experimental exploration of silicon-based nanofabrication in diatoms. Another peculiarity is that during asexual reproduction the frustules do not appear to become smaller. This allows continuous culture without need for sexual reproduction. It is not known if P. tricornutum can reproduce sexually. To date no substantial evidence has been found to support sexual reproduction in a laboratory or other setting. Although P. tricornutum can be considered to be an atypical pennate diatom it is one of the main diatom model species. A transformation protocol has been established and RNAi vectors are available. This makes molecular genetic studies much easier. History Original drawings of P. tricornutum by Bohlin Phaeodactylum tricornutum was first described in the triradiate morphotype by Bohlin in 1897. Recordings of the first cultures of P. tricornutum were published by Allen and Nelson in 1910 although it was misidentified as Nitzschia colsterium,W. Sm., forma miuntissima. The isolate was later correctly revised as P. tricorntum by J.C. Lewin in 1958. This strain among other later isolates are still maintained in culture collections around the world. Genome sequencing Phaeodactylum tricornutum is one of three diatoms whose genome has been sequenced (the others being Thalassiosira pseudonana and Fragilariopsis cylindrus). The genome contains approximately 10% prokaryote-like genes, an unusually large proportion. Over 30000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been organized into the Diatom EST Database.Maheswari, U. et al. 2005. The Diatom EST Database. Nucleic Acids Research 33: D344-D347. Phaeodactylum tricornutum has emerged as a potential microalgal energy source. It grows rapidly and storage lipids constitute about 20-30% of its dry cell weight under standard culture conditions. Nitrogen limitation can induce neutral lipid accumulation in P. tricornutum, indicating possible strategies for improving microalgal biodiesel production .

Marrons glac√©s are an ingredient in many desserts and are also eaten on their own. History Candied chestnuts appeared in chestnut- growing areas in northern Italy and southern France shortly after the crusaders returned to Europe with sugar. Cooking with sugar allowed creation of new confectioneries. A candied chestnut confection was probably served around the beginning of the 15th century in Piedmont, among other places.Vegetarians in Paradise. But marrons glac√©s as such (with the last touch of 'glazing'), may have been created only in the 16th century. Lyon and Cuneo dispute the title for the addition of the glazing, or icing, that makes the real marron glac√©. The earliest known records of a recipe for marron glac√©s were written during the XVI century by an Italian cook that worked for Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy [1580], and by the French at the end of 17th century in Louis XIV's Versailles court. In 1667, Fran√ßois Pierre La Varenne, ten years' chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Bl√©, Marquis of Uxelles (near Lyon and a chestnut-producing area), and foremost figure of the nouvelle cuisine movement of the time, published his best-selling book Le parfaict confiturier. In it he describes \\"la fa√ßon de faire marron pour tirer au sec\\" (\\"the way to make (a) chestnut (so as) to 'pull it dry'\\"); this may well be the first record of the recipe for marrons glac√©s. \\"Tirer au sec\\" means, in a confectionery context, \\"to remove (what's being candied) from the syrup\\". La Varenne's book was edited thirty times over seventy-five years. Nevertheless, that book was not mentioned (nor indeed any other) when the recipe, applied to cocoa beans, was in 1694 passed on to Jean-Baptiste Labat, a French missionary in the Martinique. That year Father Labat wrote in a letter of a recipe for candied and iced cocoa beans which he had tasted when dining at a M. Pocquet's. A very detailed letter about an adaptation of the recipe, also with glaze, applied on cocoa beans. Another early citation, still in French, is from 1690.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. marron glac√© Towards the end of 19th century, Lyon was suffering from the collapse of the textile market, notably silk. In the midst of this crisis, Cl√©ment Faugier, a bridge and roadworks engineer, was looking for a way to revitalize the regional economy. In 1882 in Privas, Ard√®che, he and a local confectioner set up the first factory with the technology to produce marrons glac√©s industrially (though many of the nearly twenty steps necessary from harvest to finished product are still performed manually). Three years later he introduced the cr√®me de marrons de l'Ard√®che, a sweetened chestnut pur√©e made from marrons glac√©s broken during the production process, flavoured with vanilla. (later came Marrons au Cognac in 1924, Pur√©e de Marrons Nature in 1934, Marrons au Naturel in 1951, and Marpom's in 1994.) The same process was used by Jos√© Posada in Ourense (Spain) in 1980. He was the first businessman in Spain to build a factory to produce Spanish marrons glac√©s using Galician raw chestnuts, which previously were exported to France to produce the confectionary. Posada used the French and Italian formula to produce the marrons glac√©s. Today, there are two factories that produce marrons glac√©s in Spain. Ch√¢taigne or marron The French refer to chestnuts as ch√¢taigne or marron. Both terms refer to the fruit of the sweet chestnut Castanea sativa. However, marron tends to denote a higher quality, larger fruit that is more easily peeled. The fifth edition of the dictionary Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Revu, corrig√© et augment√© published in 1798 states that a marron glac√© is a confit marron that is covered in caramel. The 1767 book L'agronome, ou dictionnaire portatif du cultivateur claimed that the best marrons came from the Dauphin√© region in southeastern France, and contained instructions for preparing marron glac√©s. Chestnuts are covered with a membrane, known as a pellicle or episperm, which closely adheres to the fruit's flesh and must be removed because of its astringency. Marron nuts have a pellicle which is \\"superficially attached to the nut\\", making it easily removable from the fruit. Some chestnuts have two cotyledons usually separated with deep grooves penetrating nearly all the way through the fruit; this makes them too fragile for the necessary manipulations during the cooking process. There also are other grooves on the surface, which means more embedded pellicle that must be painstakingly removed. \\"Marron\\"-quality nuts do not have the separation into two cotyledons; it appears in one piece and it shows few very shallow grooves. In Italy, the term marron denotes a specific high-quality cultivar of Castanea sativa bearing oblong fruits with a shiny, reddish epicarp and often exhibiting a small rectangular hilar scar. As with the French use of the term, there should be no division of the cotyledons. Marron-quality nuts for marrons glac√©s may be three or four times more expensive than the ch√¢taigne because they also have a lower yield as the husk usually contains only one or two nuts and the plants have sterile male flowers. Uses Mont Blanc dessert Marrons glac√©s may be eaten on their own. Cr√®me de marrons are a staple ingredient for other desserts, such as the Mont Blanc (pur√©ed with cream), ice creams, cakes, sweet sauce or garnish for other desserts. Cultural references In the short story Reginald (1901) by Saki, the narrator leaves Reginald \\"near a seductive dish of marrons glac√©s\\" at a garden-party in the vain hope that these delicacies will distract him from wreaking social havoc. In the Overture to Swann's Way, Marcel Proust refers to M. Swann bringing to Marcel's great-aunt on New Year's Day a little packet of marrons glac√©s. In Patrick Skene Catling's children's book, The Chocolate Touch, marrons glac√©s are among the candies listed as the sweet-toothed young protagonist's favorite confectionery delights. In the 1899 novel The Awakening by Kate Chopin, on a comfortable night as Edna Pontellier dines alone, she describes marrons glac√© as \\"just what she wanted\\". In the 1936 film Camille, Greta Garbo's character asks for \\"sweets\\", and Robert Taylor's character goes to some trouble to find fresh marrons glac√©s for her. In the British television drama series Victoria, Queen Victoria played by Jenna Coleman repeatedly calls marrons glac√©s her \\"favourite\\".

It is operated by the Severn Valley Railway, a heritage line which runs from Kidderminster to Bridgnorth. The station was opened on 30 July 1984, was built in a late Victorian style, and shares its station approach and car park with the adjacent National Rail station. History The first railway station at Kidderminster was opened by the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&WR;) in 1852. It became an important intermediate station on the line which became part of the West Midland Railway in 1860. In turn, the WMR was absorbed intro the Great Western Railway (GWR) between 1863 and 1870. The opening of the Severn Valley Railway in 1862 had no direct effect on Kidderminster because passengers wishing to use the line changed at Hartlebury. The situation changed in 1878, when a \\"loop-line\\" was opened between Bewdley and Kidderminster, linking Kidderminster with the Severn Valley Line. However, despite this most trains using the line ran through Bewdley, and then the Wyre Forest line to Tenbury Wells or Woofferton. From about 1900, there was a brisk passenger trade of tourists and day trippers from the West Midlands conurbation. Due to dwindling passenger numbers, the Severn Valley Line closed to through traffic in 1963. North of Bewdley, the line closed completely in early 1969 when Alveley colliery was shut down and freight traffic ceased. Passenger services on the Kidderminster, Bewdley and Hartlebury section clung on until 1970. The halt of traffic to Stourport power station in 1979, and Kidderminster - Foley Park British Sugar Corporation traffic in 1982 saw the end of regular British Rail services off the main line. Preservation With the exception of Country Park halt, Kidderminster is, by far, the youngest of the SVR stations. Bridgnorth to Bewdley passenger services started in 1974, and it was decided to extend the line to Kidderminster to attract more custom from what was (and still is) a bustling town close to the West Midlands conurbation. After Kidderminster goods yard became disused in 1982, the SVR purchased the line to the east of Foley Park. Sharing the British Rail station of Kidderminster was impractical, so SVR claimed a site to the west of the BR station. Initially, the site was leased from BR until privatisation when BR looked to sell off the site, leading to the 1994 SVR share issue to raise capital to buy it outright. Kidderminster Town lies only a few yards from Kidderminster station on the National Rail network. The name \\"Kidderminster Town\\" was chosen because GWR custom, where there were two stations in a town, was to give the \\"Town\\" designation to the closer one to the town centre, a measure by which Kidderminster Town just manages to beat its NR counterpart by around 50 metres (150 feet). When the station building was constructed insufficient funds meant only two wings of the basic building could be completed. Many of the typical Victorian GWR station fixtures and fittings also had to be omitted. The building design was based on the GWR Ross-on-Wye station building which opened in 1890.http://www.ross-on-wye.com/index.php?page=ross_530The_Railway&pg;=2 Ross-on-Wye - The Railway Since then a number of these missing features have been constructed and erected by volunteers including a cantilevered canopy in the 1880s Port Cochere style at the front of the building and the replica ornamental crestings adorning the two towers. The original iron crestings of this style are thought to have been cast by Macfarlane & Co at the Saracen Foundry, Possilpark, Glasgow. At the architect's request the replicas have been cast in aluminium to reduce the deadweight on the tower structures. To prevent corrosion due to electrolytic action all fixings to the roof structure have been electrically isolated from the aluminium castings with plastic washers etc. Examples of identical original cast iron crestings may be seen adorning Slough railway station, Wrexham General railway station and the HSBC Bank in Derby city centre. The missing wing was completed in 2006, together with a canopy covering the station concourse. The design of the steelwork for this canopy has been closely based on the former GWR station at Wolverhampton Low Level. In 2000, the carriage shed was constructed within the site. A fifth of a mile long, it is the UK's largest on a heritage railway with a capacity of circa 56 bogie vehicles. The former GWR Warehouse is now occupied by Kidderminster Railway Museum, an independent charity which works closely with the SVR. The entrance to the gauge Coalyard Miniature Railway is located next to the museum. In the Spring of 2012, it was a filming location of the fantasy adventure movie Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box, which was scheduled for release in 2013. Signalling In common with other SVR stations Kidderminster Town is comprehensively signalled. The Signal Box reuses the sign from the former Kidderminster Station Signal Box whilst the lever frame is from Acton Yard. Most lines under the signal box's control are track circuited, the notable exception is No. 1 engine line. The line between Kidderminster and Bewdley South is worked by acceptance lever, thus avoiding the need for physical tokens. Recent work has seen completion of the work to link Network Rail (NR) signalling system to that of the SVR to allow passage of passenger carrying trains directly from NR to the SVR. Previously passenger carrying trains could only pass from SVR metals to that of NR.

The fur from which it is made is referred to as Astrakhan, broadtail, qaraqulcha, or Persian lamb. The hat is peaked, and folds flat when taken off of the wearer's head. Mathura sculpture depicting similar hat style The qaraqul hat is typically worn by men in Central and South Asia. The folding qaraqul was worn by the former king of Afghanistan, Amanullah Khan in 1919. The karakul, which had distinguished all educated urban men since the beginning of the 20th century, has fallen out of fashion in Afghanistan. Soviet Politburo hat Leonid Brezhnev in Karakul hat in 1974 In the USSR, the karakul hat became very popular among Politburo members. It became common that Soviet leaders appeared in public, wearing this type of hat. The hat probably gained its prestige among Party leaders because it was an obligatory parade attribute of the czar and Soviet generals. By wearing the karakul hat, Soviet leaders wanted to underline their high political status. In the Soviet Union this hat also took the nickname the pie-hat because it resembled traditional Russian pies. Karakul worn by ethnic Russian, or Soviet peoples are cylindrical and are unlike the \\"Jinnah cap\\" worn in South Asia. Jinnah cap A Jinnah cap is a fur qaraqul hat named after the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The cap was worn by many of the early politicians of Pakistan, especially the founding party: the Pakistan Muslim League. The Jinnah cap and shalwar kameez are the national dress of Pakistan. Many Pakistani politicians and heads of state including President Ayub Khan have worn the Jinnah cap. It is also worn in Nepal by men mostly of Indo-Aryan descent. It is called Dhaka topi and is the national hat of Nepal. The Jinnah Cap is particularly popular amongst Islamic religious scholars and the elder generation of Balochistan, Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Kashmir. The velvet version of the cap is called a Rampuri cap. In 1937, the 25th Annual Conference of the All-India Muslim League was held in Lucknow under the chairmanship of Quaid-e-Azam (The Great Leader), Muhammad Ali Jinnah. An amalgamation of approximately seventy preeminent people were summoned at Butler Palace in Lucknow. Prior to attending this conference, Nawab Mohammad Ismail Khan suggested that the day held an auspicious meaning. It was a day when the Indian Muslim population earnestly embraced and hailed Jinnah as their foremost leader. Perceiving it to be apt; Khan took his Samoor Cap and offered it to Jinnah, insisting that it would suit him well. Jinnah accepted his offer, to thereafter wear a traditional Sherwani/Achkan along with it. When the Jinnah appeared on the dais in his rustic attire; the large crowd, consisting of 50,000 people, burst into cheers. There were slogans of \\"Allah-ho-Akbar\\" (God, The Greatest) and the clapping continued for a some time. Since that day, Khan's Samoor Cap‚Äîpreviously unknown to the masses‚Äîwas dubbed and came to be known as the iconic \\"Jinnah cap\\" all over South Asia and elsewhere in the world. Over the active years of the All-India Muslim League, before eventually Pakistan was consummated, Khan's cap would be lent to Jinnah on several occasions.  Kashmiri variations  Farooq Abdullah, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir from India, wearing a Karakul. Bukhara Karakul skins and Karakul hats Karakul caps have been worn by Kashmiris for the past several decades.Kashmiri Karakul The Karakul cap is colloquially known as a \\"Karakuli\\" in the Kashmir Valley. Although it is now associated with the Kashmiri gentry, it is not actually a native Kashmiri headgear. It may have been made popular by Muslim leaders in the Kashmir Valley during the freedom movement of the 1930s/40s and was pioneered by Sheikh Abdullah. The traditional headgear of the landed gentry in Kashmir has historically been the turban tied in a similar fashion to the Pashtun equivalent (but this has now disappeared) as seen in many old photographs. The peasants in Kashmir still wear the typical skull cap associated with Muslims world over. A turban is now more of a symbol of honour in Kashmir. In most religious shrines of Kashmir, the priests wear turbans. Some of the turbans have been of ordinary dyed muslin cloth mostly of saffron color with a dashing of green sometimes, where as some represent very exquisite and fashionable headgear. Most of the politicians in Kashmir have given up the use of a turban which used to be the symbol of dignity and honor, except for ceremonial use. The Karakul caps are popular amongst most of the mainstream politicians. It is quite common for a Kashmiri groom to remove the traditional turban and replace it with a Karakul Cap as he waits at his in- laws house for his bride to accompany him home. In the Kashmiri Muslim diaspora the Karakul cap is now only worn at important moments.  African variations  Karakul caps became popular among Africans and African-Americans in the 1960s. African Presidents such as Modibo Ke√Øta of Mali and Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© of Guinea, who were themselves both of pre-colonial African royal descent, wore the karakul cap to show their independence from European colonial power. The karakul cap is often worn by African and African-American Christians and Jews. Both the velvet and faux fur versions are worn by men of African descent with Western suits, and African attire such as the grand boubou. Muslims of African ancestry wear these caps with the dishdasha. In urban slang, the karakul cap is called a fur kufi, while the Rampuri cap is called a velvet fez hat. When worn properly, these caps are always slanted at an angle, and never placed straight on the head. Leopard print karakul caps are common in Africa, but are rarely seen in the United States. In popular culture, Eddie Murphy wore the karakul cap in the movie Coming to America.

This process is commonly used in the detection of electron antineutrinos in neutrino detectors, such as the first detection of antineutrinos in the Cowan‚ÄìReines neutrino experiment, or in neutrino experiments such as KamLAND and Borexino. It is an essential process to experiments involving low-energy neutrinos (< 60 MeV) such as those studying neutrino oscillation, reactor neutrinos, sterile neutrinos, and geoneutrinos. The IBD reaction can only be used to detect antineutrinos (rather than normal matter neutrinos, such as from the Sun) due to lepton conservation.  Reaction  Inverse beta decay proceeds as \\\\+ ‚Üí + , where an electron antineutrino () interacts with a proton () to produce a positron () and a neutron (). The IBD reaction can only be initiated when the antineutrino possesses at least 1.806 MeV of kinetic energy (called the threshold energy). This threshold energy is due to a difference in mass between the products ( and ) and the reactants ( and ) and also slightly due to a relativistic mass effect on the antineutrino. Most of the antineutrino energy is distributed to the positron due to its small mass relative to the neutron. The positron promptly undergoes matter‚Äìantimatter annihilation after creation and yields a flash of light with energy calculated as , where 511 keV is the electron and positron rest energy, is the visible energy from the reaction, and is the antineutrino kinetic energy. After the prompt positron annihilation, the neutron undergoes neutron capture on an element in the detector, producing a delayed flash of 2.22 MeV if captured on a proton. The timing of the delayed capture is 200‚Äì300 microseconds after IBD initiation ( in the Borexino detector). The timing and spatial coincidence between the prompt positron annihilation and delayed neutron capture provides a clear IBD signature in neutrino detectors, allowing for discrimination from background. The IBD cross section is dependent on antineutrino energy and capturing element, although is generally on the order of 10‚àí44 cm2 (‚àº attobarns).

History The 1860 Act was promoted by landowners and supported by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;) who, along with the Great Northern Railway (GNR) were allowed to subscribe. Together the MSLR and GNR formed a joint committee to operate this railway along with three others that had been authorised but were not yet open. Together these railways connected up to provide an alternative route into North Cheshire that avoided Manchester. Each company was to provide an equal amount of capital and four representatives to the joint management committee. This arrangement was confirmed by the Great Northern (Cheshire Lines) Act in Parliament in 1863. This Act had not, however, formally set up a separate legal body, providing instead for the two companies to manage and work the four railways through their existing structures. This arrangement eventually led to the formation of the Cheshire Lines Committee in 1865. The line was then formally brought under the direct joint ownership of the MS&LR; and GNR in 1865 by the Cheshire Lines Transfer Act, 1865. The Act allowed the Midland Railway (MR) to join as an equal partner, which it did in 1866. and finally The Cheshire Lines Committee was authorised by The Cheshire Lines Act, 1867 as a fully independent organisation with a board formed from three directors from each of the parent companies.

Investment casting has been used in various forms for the last 5,000 years. In its earliest forms, beeswax was used to form patterns necessary for the casting process. Today, more advanced waxes, refractory materials and specialist alloys are typically used for making patterns. Investment casting is valued for its ability to produce components with accuracy, repeatability, versatility and integrity in a variety of metals and high-performance alloys. The fragile wax patterns must withstand forces encountered during the mold making. Much of the wax used in investment casting can be reclaimed and reused.. Lost-foam casting is a modern form of investment casting that eliminates certain steps in the process. Investment casting derives its name from the pattern being invested (surrounded) with a refractory material. Many materials are suitable for investment casting; examples are stainless steel alloys, brass, aluminium, carbon steel and glass. The material is poured into a cavity in a refractory material that is an exact duplicate of the desired part. Due to the hardness of refractory materials used, investment casting can produce products with exceptional surface qualities, which can reduce the need for secondary machine processes.Investment Castings Water glass and silica sol investment casting are the two primary investment casting methods nowadays. The main differences are the surface roughness and cost of casting. Water glass method dewaxes into the high-temperature water, and the ceramic mold is made of water glass quartz sand. Silica sol method dewaxes into the flash fire, and silica sol zircon sand makes the ceramic mold. Silica sol method costs more but has the better surface than the water glass method. The process can be used for both small castings of a few ounces and large castings weighing several hundred pounds. It can be more expensive than die casting or sand casting, but per-unit costs decrease with large volumes. Investment casting can produce complicated shapes that would be difficult or impossible with other casting methods. It can also produce products with exceptional surface qualities and low tolerances with minimal surface finishing or machining required. Process A wax pattern used to create a jet engine turbine blade Castings can be made from an original wax model (the direct method) or from wax replicas of an original pattern that need not be made from wax (the indirect method). The following steps describe the indirect process, which can take two to seven days to complete. # Produce a master pattern: An artist or mould-maker creates an original pattern from wax, clay, wood, plastic, or another material.. In recent years the production of patterns using 3D printing has become popular using mainly resin based SLA or DLP printers for high resolution patterns or standard PLA filament filament when high levels of accuracy are not required. If using a 3D Printed pattern proceed directly to step 5. # Create a mould: A mould, known as the master die, is made to fit the master pattern. If the master pattern was made from steel, the master die can be cast directly from the pattern using metal with a lower melting point. Rubber moulds can also be cast directly from the master pattern. Alternatively, a master die can be machined independently‚Äîwithout creating a master pattern. # Produce wax patterns: Although called wax patterns, pattern materials may also include plastic and frozen mercury. Wax patterns can be produced in one of two ways. In one process, the wax is poured into the mold and swished around until an even coating, usually about thick, covers the inner surface of the mould. This is repeated until the desired pattern thickness is reached. Another method involves filling the entire mould with molten wax and letting it cool as a solid object. If a core is required, there are two options: soluble wax or ceramic. Soluble wax cores are designed to melt out of the investment coating with the rest of the wax pattern; ceramic cores are removed after the product has hardened. # Assemble wax patterns: Multiple wax patterns can be created and assembled into one large pattern to be cast in one batch pour. In this situation, patterns are attached to a wax sprue to create a pattern cluster, or tree. To attach patterns, a heating tool is used to slightly melt designated wax surfaces, which are then pressed against each other and left to cool and harden. As many as several hundred patterns can be assembled into a tree.. Wax patterns can also be chased, which means parting lines or flashings are rubbed out using the heated metal tool. Finally, patterns are dressed (by removing imperfections) to look like finished pieces.. # Apply investment materials: The ceramic mould, known as the investment, is produced by repeating a series of steps‚Äîcoating, stuccoing, and hardening‚Äîuntil a desired thickness is achieved. Coating involves dipping a pattern cluster into a slurry of fine refractory material and then draining to create a uniform surface coating. Fine materials are used in this first step, also called a prime coat, to preserve fine details from the mould. Stuccoing applies coarse ceramic particles by dipping patterns into a fluidised bed, placing it in a rainfall- sander, or by applying materials by hand. Hardening allows coatings to cure. These steps are repeated until the investment reaches its required thickness‚Äîusually . Investment moulds are left to dry completely, which can take 16 to 48 hours. Drying can be accelerated by applying a vacuum or minimizing environmental humidity. Investment moulds can also be created by placing the pattern clusters into a flask and then pouring liquid investment material from above. The flask is then vibrated to allow entrapped air to escape and help the investment material fill any small voids.. Common refractory materials used to create the investments are: silica, zircon, various aluminium silicates, and alumina. Silica is usually used in the fused silica form, but sometimes quartz is used because it is less expensive. Aluminium silicates are a mixture of alumina and silica, where commonly used mixtures have an alumina content from 42 to 72%; at 72% alumina the compound is known as mullite. During the primary coat(s), zircon-based refractories are commonly used, because zirconium is less likely to react with the molten metal. Prior to silica, a mixture of plaster and ground up old molds (chamotte) was used.. The binders used to hold the refractory material in place include: ethyl silicate (alcohol-based and chemically set), colloidal silica (water-based, also known as silica sol, set by drying), sodium silicate, and a hybrid of these controlled for pH and viscosity. # Dewax: Once ceramic moulds have fully cured, they are turned upside-down and placed in a furnace or autoclave to melt out and/or vaporize the wax. Most shell failures occur at this point because the waxes used have a thermal expansion coefficient that is much greater than the investment material surrounding it‚Äîas the wax is heated it expands and introduces stress. To minimize these stresses the wax is heated as rapidly as possible so that outer wax surfaces can melt and drain quickly, making space for the rest of the wax to expand. In certain situations, holes may be drilled into the mold before heating to help reduce these stresses. Any wax that runs out of the mold is usually recovered and reused.. # Burnout preheating: The mold is then subjected to a burnout, which heats the mold to between 870 ¬∞C and 1095 ¬∞C to remove any moisture and residual wax, and to sinter the mold. Sometimes this heating is also used to preheat the mold before pouring, but other times the mould is allowed to cool so that it can be tested. Preheating allows the metal to stay liquid longer so that it can better fill all mould details and increase dimensional accuracy. If the mold is left to cool, any cracks found can be repaired with ceramic slurry or special cements. # Pouring: The investment mold is then placed open- side up into a tub filled with sand. The metal may be gravity poured or forced by applying positive air pressure or other forces. Vacuum casting, tilt casting, pressure assisted pouring and centrifugal casting are methods that use additional forces and are especially useful when moulds contain thin sections that would be otherwise be difficult to fill.. # Divesting: The shell is hammered, media blasted, vibrated, waterjeted, or chemically dissolved (sometimes with liquid nitrogen) to release the casting. The sprue is cut off and recycled. The casting may then be cleaned up to remove signs of the casting process, usually by grinding. # Finishing: After grinding, the completed casting is then subject to finishing. This usually goes further than grinding, with impurities and negatives being removed via hand tooling and welding. In the case that the part needs additional straightening, this process is usually carried out by hydraulic straightening presses, which bring the product in line with its tolerances.

Some of the reasons for the high cost include specialized equipment, costly refractories, and binders, many operations to make a mould, a lot of labor is needed and occasional minute defects occur. However, the cost is still less than producing the same part by machining from bar stock; for example, gun manufacturing has moved to investment casting to lower costs of producing pistols. Additionally: * It can be difficult to cast objects requiring cores. * This process is expensive, is usually limited to small casting, and presents some difficulties where cores are involved. * Holes cannot be smaller than 1/16 in. (1.6 mm) and should be no deeper than about 1.5 times the diameter. * Investment castings require longer production cycles compared to other casting processes. =Counter- gravity casting= The variation on the gravity pouring technique is to fill the mold using a vacuum. A common form of this is called the Hitchiner process after the Hitchiner Manufacturing Company that invented the technique. In this technique, the mold has a downward fill pipe that is lowered into the melt. A vacuum draws the melt into the cavity; when the important parts have solidified, the vacuum is released, and the unused material leaves the mold. The technique can use substantially less material than gravity pouring because the sprue and some gating need not solidify.. This technique is more metal efficient than traditional pouring because less material solidifies in the gating system. Gravity pouring only has a 15 to 50% metal yield compared to 60 to 95% for counter-gravity pouring. There is also less turbulence, so the gating system can be simplified since it does not have to control turbulence. The metal is drawn from below the top of the pool, so the metal is free from dross and slag (which are lower density (lighter) and float to the top of the pool). The pressure differential helps the metal flow into every intricacy of the mold. Finally, lower temperatures can be used, which improves the grain structure. This process is also used to cast refractory ceramics under the term vacuum casting. =Vacuum pressure casting= Vacuum pressure casting (VPC), properly referred to as vacuum assist direct pour, uses gas pressure and a vacuum to improve the quality of the casting and minimize porosity. Typically VPC machines consist of an upper and a lower chamber‚Äîthe upper chamber, or melting chamber, housing the crucible, and the lower casting chamber housing the investment mould. Both chambers are connected via a small hole containing a stopper. A vacuum is pulled in the lower chamber, while pressure is applied in the upper, and then the stopper is removed. This creates the greatest pressure differential to fill the molds. The most common materials for vacuum casting process are the high nickel-based alloy and super alloys. Turbocharger products are a common applications for this casting process, though it is also regularly used in the manufacture of silver and gold jewellery. Details Investment casting is used with almost any castable metal. However, aluminium alloys, copper alloys, and steel are the most common. In industrial use, the size limits are to several hundred kilograms. The cross-sectional limits are to . Typical tolerances are 0.1 mm for the first 25 mm (0.005 in for the first inch) and 0.02 mm for the each additional centimeter (0.002 in for each additional inch). A standard surface finish is 1.3‚Äì4 micrometres (50‚Äì125 Œºin) RMS.. History The history of lost-wax casting dates back thousands of years. Its earliest use was for idols, ornaments and jewellery, using natural beeswax for patterns, clay for the moulds and manually operated bellows for stoking furnaces. Examples have been found across the world, such as in the Harappan Civilisation (2500‚Äì2000 BC) idols, Egypt's tombs of Tutankhamun (1333‚Äì1324 BC), Mesopotamia, Aztec and Mayan Mexico, and the Benin civilization in Africa where the process produced detailed artwork of copper, bronze and gold. The earliest known text that describes the investment casting process (Schedula Diversarum Artium) was written around 1100 A.D. by Theophilus Presbyter, a monk who described various manufacturing processes, including the recipe for parchment. This book was used by sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini (1500‚Äì1571), who detailed in his autobiography the investment casting process he used for the Perseus with the Head of Medusa sculpture that stands in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, Italy. Investment casting came into use as a modern industrial process in the late 19th century, when dentists began using it to make crowns and inlays, as described by Barnabas Frederick Philbrook of Council Bluffs, Iowa in 1897. Its use was accelerated by William H. Taggart of Chicago, whose 1907 paper described his development of a technique. He also formulated a wax pattern compound of excellent properties, developed an investment material, and invented an air-pressure casting machine. In the 1940s, World War II increased the demand for precision net shape manufacturing and specialized alloys that could not be shaped by traditional methods, or that required too much machining. Industry turned to investment casting. After the war, its use spread to many commercial and industrial applications that used complex metal parts. Applications Unveiling the titanium integral space bus satellite by Planetary Resources in February 2014. The sacrificial mold for the investment casting was 3D-printed with integral cable routing and toroidal propellant tank. From left: Peter Diamandis, Chris Lewicki, and Steve Jurvetson. Investment casting is used in the aerospace and power generation industries to produce turbine blades with complex shapes or cooling systems. Blades produced by investment casting can include single-crystal (SX), directionally solidified (DS), or conventional equiaxed blades. Investment casting is also widely used by firearms manufacturers to fabricate firearm receivers, triggers, hammers, and other precision parts at low cost. Karsten Solheim famously revolutionized golf club design through his company PING by incorporating investment casting for the first time for clubheads. Quickly the process became an industry standard to allow weight distribution around the perimeter of the clubhead. Other industries that use standard investment-cast parts include military, medical, commercial and automotive. With the increased availability of higher-resolution 3D printers, 3D printing has begun to be used to make much larger sacrificial molds used in investment casting. Planetary Resources has used the technique to print the mold for a new small satellite, which is then dipped in ceramic to form the investment cast for a titanium space bus with integral propellant tank and embedded cable routing.

Life Caraccioli was born in Paris to a noble family of Neapolitan origin, and held the title of Marquis. He studied in Mans and travelled in Italy, Germany and Poland and returned to Paris around 1768. Caraccioli started his literary career during his travels in Italy. He wrote prolifically on a broad range of subjects. Caraccioli survived the French Revolution, despite his close ties to French aristocracy during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, but was left financially ruined. In 1795, he was awarded a 2000 franc pension by the National Convention. He died poor in Paris, in 1803, leaving, it is said, only eighty francs behind him. His work was not ranked highly in his time; one of the old French biographical dictionaries, Nouvelle biographie g√©n√©rale, describes him as un litt√©rateur (a maker of literature) rather than un √©crivain (a writer). He is especially interesting to eighteenth-century scholars of manners, Pope Clement XIV and ultramontanism, among other subjects. Caraccioli is best known among book collectors for his color-printed books ‚Äì Le livre de quatre couleurs (1757) and Le livre √† la mode (1759) ‚Äì as well as La jouissance de soi-m√™me (1759), Li√®ge de Le v√©ritable mentor (1759), Le langage de la raison (1763), De la gaiet√© (1767), L‚Äôagriculture simplifi√©e (1769), Le Voyage de la Raison en Europe (1772), and Lettres int√©ressantes du pape Cl√©ment XIV (1776), many of which went through numerous editions in Europe and the United States and have been translated into several languages. Lettres int√©ressantes du pape Cl√©ment XIV, which are considered by many to be forgeries, initially misled many Europeans about the life of the then recently deceased Pope.Attenborough, J.M., \\"A Remarkable Literary Deception\\", The Gentleman's Magazine, Bradbury, Evans, 1904, p. 219 One of his most studied and collected books, Les adieux de la Mar√©chale de *** √† ses enfants (1769) (trans. Advice from a Lady of Quality to her Children, in the Last Stage of a Lingering Illness, In a Series of Evening-Conferences on the Most Interesting Subjects) was written in a series of \\"conferences\\" or meetings, which substitute for chapters or the more common use of letters. Unlike most courtesy books, Caraccioli's has the semblance of a plot and reads somewhat like a novel, which ends with the death of the main character. Caraccioli's work evolved a great deal over the half-century in which it was produced, and gradually reflected many modern values. Today many of his books are collected by various libraries throughout Europe and America, especially the Biblioth√®que nationale de France and the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library at UCLA.

It has secondary chloroplasts, and is a mixotroph able to feed by photosynthesis or phagocytosis. It has a highly flexible cell surface, allowing it to change shape from a thin cell up to 100 ¬µm long, to a sphere of approximately 20 ¬µm. Each cell has two flagella, only one of which emerges from the flagellar pocket (reservoir) in the anterior of the cell, and can move by swimming, or by so-called \\"euglenoid\\" movement across surfaces. E. gracilis has been used extensively in the laboratory as a model organism, particularly for studying cell biology and biochemistry. Taxonomy Euglena gracilis A morphological and molecular study of the Euglenozoa put E. gracilis in close kinship with the species Khawkinea quartana, with Peranema trichophorum basal to both, although a later molecular analysis showed that E. gracilis was, in fact, more closely related to Astasia longa than to certain other species recognized as Euglena. The transcriptome of E. gracilis was recently sequenced, providing information about all of the genes that the organism is actively using. They found that E. gracilis has a whole host of new, unclassified genes which can make complex carbohydrates and natural products.The potential in your pond published on August 14, 2015 by the \\"John Innes Centre\\" References Category:Euglenozoa ","title":"Euglena gracilis"},{"id":"4883595","title":"List of highways numbered 14"},{"id":"4883600","text":"The CLEVER (for \\"compact low emission vehicle for urban transport\\") is a type of tilting three-wheeled motor vehicle that was developed in a collaboration between the University of Bath, BMW and a number of other partners from across Europe. CLEVER is designed as an alternative to conventional means of personal urban transport. The narrow body endows it with some of the manoeuvrability and congestion avoiding capability of a motorcycle, whilst offering comparable weather and impact protection to a car. Carbon emissions are reduced as a function of low weight and a small frontal area. The narrow track width requires that CLEVER tilts into corners to maintain stability; thus it is fitted with a Direct Tilt Control (DTC) system that uses hydraulic actuators linking the cabin to the non-tilting rear engine module. The CLEVER Vehicle Prototype without bodywork, June 2013. Side View of the CLEVER Vehicle Prototype without bodywork, June 2013. Note the miniature hydraulic actuator (partially obscured by the cabin frame) and the intermediate steering arm used in the active steering system. CLEVER measures only 1 meter wide and has a maximum speed of approximately 50 mph. It runs on compressed natural gas, achieving a predicted 188 miles per gallon fuel efficiency. Construction of the first of five prototype vehicles was completed on Friday, April 21, 2006. Shortly after construction, track testing of a prototype vehicle revealed that, in certain transient situations, the DTC system could not guarantee stability of the vehicle. , research into alternative tilt control strategies for the CLEVER vehicle is still on-going at the University of Bath. Vehicle configuration CLEVER features a two-seat tandem layout, a single front wheel, tilting cabin, and a two-wheeled rear engine module. The total vehicle mass is approximately 332 kg (excluding driver and bodywork); with a 75 kg driver the static weight distribution is 39% front and 61% rear. The rear module does not tilt and accounts for approximately 40% of the laden vehicle mass meaning only 60% can be tilted to balance the vehicle whilst cornering. CLEVER's wheelbase is 2.4m, as long as many conventional city cars, but there are no overhangs so total length is under 3m. The track width is just 0.84m giving a total vehicle width of 1.00m. Whilst the Clever vehicle was intended to use a low emission engine burning compresses natural gas, the research prototype at the University of Bath uses a 13 kW 176cc single cylinder engine taken from BMW C1 scooter. The original CVT gearbox is retained (albeit modified to provide a power take off to drive the pump for the tilt hydraulics); belt drives are used to transmit power to the two rear wheels. Rear suspension is by way of independent trailing arms, adjustable √ñhlins spring/damper units and an anti-roll bar. The front wheel is suspended by a leading four bar linkage with a single √ñhlins spring/damper unit and uses a hub-centric steering system. A single track-rod transmits steer inputs to the front wheel from the output arm of a worm-gear steering box, the driver's steer inputs are transmitted to the steering box via a modified wheel and column sourced from a BMW car. Tilting system CLEVER employs an electronically controlled and hydraulically actuated Direct Tilt Control system with a maximum tilt angle of ¬±45¬∞ [6]. A pair of single acting hydraulic actuators generate a tilting moment about the tilt bearing (which joins the cabin and rear module). The tilt controller uses driver's steer input and the vehicle's speed to estimate the lateral acceleration and hence the appropriate tilt angle. The DTC system provides excellent stability at low speeds but during vigorous manoeuvres at higher speeds the system's torque output exceeds that which can be reacted by the non-tilting rear module; as a result the inside rear wheel lifts, this can lead to the vehicle rolling over. To improve the roll stability in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an active steering system in 2012; this allowed the use of a combined Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) strategy. The active steering system output is a function of the vehicle's tilt angle error (the difference between the actual and ideal tilt angle), therefore at steady state when there is little or no tilt angle error the front wheel steer angle matches the driver's steer demand. However, in transient situations, such as upon turn-in, a tilt angle error exists and the active steering system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver's steering input. In extreme conditions it will also initiate a countersteering action whereby the front wheel momentarily steers in the opposite direction to that intended by the driver. As the cabin approaches the desired tilt angle, the magnitude of the tilt angle error is reduced and the front wheel steer angle takes on the value demanded by the driver. By reducing the severity of the driver's steer inputs, or indeed initiating countersteer, the active steering system delays the onset of lateral acceleration and reduces the moment necessary for the DTC actuators to tilt the cabin of the vehicle into the corner. This reduced tilting moment benefits both vehicle stability and energy consumption. Simulation results show a significant reduction in load transfer across the rear axle.Berote, J.J.H., 2010. Dynamics and Control of a Tilting Three Wheeled Vehicle. Thesis (Ph.D.). University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom. In 2014 experimental results were published showing a 40% reduction in the load transfer across the rear axle during a severe ramp steer manoeuvre conducted at 10 m/s and showing that the combined SDTC strategy became more effective at higher speeds .Robertson, James W., Jos Darling, and Andrew R. Plummer. \\"Combined steering‚Äìdirect tilt control for the enhancement of narrow tilting vehicle stability.\\" Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering (2014): 0954407014522445.. In the same article, it is noted that the whilst the driver of a SDTC equipped vehicle is subject to an additional under-steer sensation during harsh transient manoeuvres, this does not inhibit his/her ability to control the vehicle's trajectory. Safety In crash tests conducted, it received a USNCAP 3-star safety rating (at 56 km/h). The head and chest stresses on the driver were very good, and the head stresses on the passenger were also acceptable as a result of the energy-absorbing foam on the driver's backrest. > The intrusion in the driver‚Äôs footwell was very low and posed no threat to > the driver‚Äôs extremities.

All students are able and encouraged to pursue music as a major subject area. History  The Girard Academic Music Program began operation in September 1974 as an alternative program within the Stephen Girard School at 18th and Snyder Avenue. It began with one 4th and one 5th grade class of approximately 55 students, 2 academic teachers, 1 teacher's aide and 1 music teacher/coordinator. They were the pioneers who initiated the academic and musical success of the school. Over its lifetime, the school has been based in several locations. From its inception until 1976, it was located in the Trinity Church Parish House at 18th & Wolf Streets). In 1976, it moved to the Armory, now owned by St. Rita's Church, located at Broad & Wharton Streets. Since 1979, the school has been located in the former Edgar Allan Poe School at 22nd & Ritner Streets, in the Girard Estate neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The building was designed by Henry deCoursey Richards and built in 1913‚Äì1914. It is a four- story, five bay, brick and limestone building on a raised basement in the Tudor Revival-style. It features a three-bay, projecting center section with an arched limestone entrance, decorative panels, and a parapet with battlement cuts. It was named for author Edgar Allan Poe. The Poe school was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. As one of the first Small Learning Communities, GAMP has grown to its present size of a staff of 50 and over 1000 students that include grades 5 through 12. The unique school organization has all students as ‚Äúmusic majors‚Äù providing the framework for the development of a strong academic and musical program. With a 97‚Äì100% college acceptance rate among each senior class and scholarships valued at over one to two million dollars yearly, GAMP continues to grow in stature within the city of Philadelphia. Music Studies GAMP Clef Musical Symbol In addition to a rigorous, college-preparatory curriculum, students are required to enroll in several music courses every year, and may choose additional classes or ensembles to further develop their musicianship. All students at GAMP participate in general choir, which is organized by grade groups: 5th and 6th grade, 7th and 8th grade, and 9th through 12th grade. The concert choir is an auditioned group which performs the most advanced repertoire and travels for various performances throughout the school year. The Concert Choir has performed for United States President Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the Philadelphia Phillies, former Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, former Mayors of Philadelphia John Street and Michael Nutter, the inauguration for Mayor Jim Kenney, and alongside Grammy Award-winning singer Idina Menzel. All students have three periods of Music Theory weekly. In theory class, students lean the basic building blocks of music, including sight singing, rhythm performance, dictation, written theory, composition, and functional piano skills. Advanced Placement Music Theory is offered for 11th and 12th grade students. The Instrumental Music department consists of a variety of ensembles for both middle and high school students, including String Orchestra, Concert Band, Jazz Band, Marching Band. Students enrolled in instrumental music are provided weekly group lessons for their instrument. Ensembles have performed at a diverse number of locations and events, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Side by Side with the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Rittenhouse Square Flower Show, the Warwick Hotel, and the Marching Band in the annual Philadelphia Columbus Day Parade. =Sports= The school has cross country, baseball, tennis, basketball, softball, and cheerleading. Additionally, students may participate in other sports (football, volleyball, wrestling) through a partnership with South Philadelphia High School. The GAMP mascot is the Pioneer. The mascot was named in a contest with Robert Fiss's selection of \\"Pioneers\\". \\"Quakers\\" was the second choice. The Pioneer was chosen because pioneers were courageous and contributed to the growth of this nation. GAMP is a pioneer in the field of education, by instilling in every student the art of music, making it a rarity in the School District of Philadelphia. Much like the Pioneers contributed to the growth of this nation by courageously settling unknown frontiers, GAMP contributes to the growth of young minds.

Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015‚Äì16, p. 70. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. Development Development of the aircraft that became the SeaRey began in the 1970s with the introduction of the Advanced Aviation Hi- Nuski ultralight. In the early 1980s Stanley Richter, his son Wayne Richter, Wayne's wife Nina Richter and Wayne's son Kerry Richter established Advanced Aviation where they designed and manufactured a number of different designs. The company produced the Buccaneer XA and two place Buccaneer II flying boats for Highcraft AeroMarine, and designed the improved Buccaneer SX. The company was sold in 1992. In June 1992, Wayne and Kerry Richter, along with Advanced Aviation employee Paige Lynette, formed a new company, Progressive Aerodyne, where they designed the first SeaRey prototype. The SeaRey had its inaugural flight on 13 November 1992. The performance, including a speed of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) surpassed the design goals. Between its introduction in 1992 and 2006 over 400 SeaRey kits were delivered to customers. The latest variant of the Searey is the LSA (also available as LSX) for the US light-sport aircraft category, introduced in 2010. =Category eligibility= In the United States the SeaRey may be registered either as a light sport aircraft or as an amateur-built experimental. The Canadian Aviation Regulations allow the SeaRey to be registered either as an amateur built, basic ultralight or as an advanced ultralight aeroplane. The SeaRey 115 is only eligible as an AULA if the carbon fiber hull is used, due to category empty weight limitations. Design The SeaRey's high wing is tapered and swept back from the leading edge with a straight trailing edge. The wing, nearly 31 ft (10 m) in span, is strut-braced and covered with aircraft fabric. Designed to be amphibious, the SeaRey has a semi-monocoque hull similar to that of a boat. The hull, nose deck, and \\"turtle\\" deck (the element which forms the top surface behind the canopy) are riveted together. In the basic configuration, these pieces are made of fiberglass; carbon graphite hull components are available at extra cost and reduce overall weight by about 70 pounds (32 kg). The wings feature rotocast plastic floats mounted on aluminum struts. There is only one model of the SeaRey but different hull designs of increasing strength have developed over the years, designated as \\"A,\\" \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" hulls. The latest \\"C\\" hull is available in either carbon fiber or fiberglass. The windshield and the sliding canopies on either side are made of Lexan. The canopies are track-mounted, can be opened in flight and can also be locked closed on the ground. The SeaRey's single engine is mounted above the wing, and drives a single rear-facing pusher propeller. The SeaRey can be equipped with the Rotax 582, Rotax 912, Rotax 912S or the Rotax 914 turbocharged engine which produces . In December 2017 the design was undergoing testing with the turbocharged Rotax 915 iS engine. The SeaRey's landing gear consists of two main retractable wheels and a tailwheel in conventional landing gear configuration. Originally the landing gear was retracted for water operations by means of a mechanical Johnson-bar lever that raises or lowers all three wheels simultaneously. More recent retraction options include: manual, hydraulic or electric. The electric actuator is the newest and most popular, but the manual is the lightest. According to the factory construction time for an experienced builder to complete a SeaRey is about 400 hours, with 600 hours typical for a first time builder. Operational history In 2015, over the course of seven months, pilot Michael Smith flew around the world in a SeaRey, setting a record as the first person to fly a solo circumnavigation of the globe in a single engine flying boat.

Life and career =Early years= Slade was born in Boulder, Colorado and raised in the Denver metropolitan area with his family, which included both parents‚Äîwho were missionaries from the same family‚Äîand two younger brothers, Caleb and Micah. He also lived for a time in Guatemala due to his parents' profession, where he studied at Interamerican School in the city of Quetzaltenango. The Slade family are of English and Slovakian descent. He attended Faith Christian Academy in Arvada, Colorado and later attended the University of Colorado, Denver, as a music and entertainment industry studies major. He received a Bachelor of Music. Slade started singing when he was 8 years old, and began playing the piano at 11, after temporarily losing his voice. He wrote his first song when he was 16 and learned to play guitar when he was in high school. =The Fray= Formation and early stages Slade joined Ember, a band which consisted of Slade and his future band-mates Dave Welsh and Ben Wysocki. The band soon dissolved, and later, in the spring of 1999, Slade ran into former school-mate and vocalist/guitarist Joe King in a record store. The two began regular jam sessions, which led to writing songs. They later added Slade's younger brother, Caleb, on bass and Zach Johnson on drums. Dave Welsh and Ben Wysocki re-joined Slade and King, to form the Fray. They soon released Movement EP, and in 2003, they released Reason EP to some local critical acclaim, particularly by Denver's Westword alternative newsweekly. Despite these reviews, the band struggled to launch a single. Denver radio station KTCL rejected eight of their songs before the band decided to submit \\"Cable Car\\". The song found airplay on a KTCL radio show highlighting local bands and the radio station received a large number of requests for it soon thereafter. The band changed the name of the song to \\"Over My Head (Cable Car)\\", and by the end of 2005, it had become KTCL's most played song of the year. Charity work Slade performed on the 2010 remake of the 1985 charity single, \\"We Are the World\\". He joined 85 other artists on February 1, 2010, to record the track for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. On October 27, 2013, Slade and the Fray played at the Colorado Flood Benefit Concert that raised nearly $500,000 for victims of the flood. Influences Slade stated in an interview that one of the first songs that inspired him was \\"Swallowed\\" by Bush, and that the lyrics and tune had moved him enough to pursue his career. In a post on AOL Radio Blog, he wrote: > \\"As a boy 'Swallowed' was my siren's song. I was a sheltered church child > and here's this man talking about living the life his way, doing whatever he > felt like doing. Bush wasn't allowed in my house either, which made it that > much more mysterious.\\" His other musical influences include Nine Inch Nails, Queen, Radiohead, R.E.M., Counting Crows, U2, and Led Zeppelin.

It is used medically in eye drops to dilate the pupil (a process called mydriasis), so that the back of the eye can be examined. It is also a major metabolite of amphetamine and certain substituted amphetamines. Medical use 4-Hydroxyamphetamine is used in eye drops to dilate the pupil (a process called mydriasis) so that the back of the eye can be examined. This is a diagnostic test for Horner's Syndrome. Patients with Horner's syndrome exhibit anisocoria brought about by lesions on the nerves that connect to the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve. Application of 4-hydroxyamphetamine to the eye can indicate whether the lesion is preganglionic or postganglionic based on the pupil's response. If the pupil dilates, the lesion is preganglionic. If the pupil does not dilate, the lesion is postganglionic. 4-hydroxyamphetamine has some limitations to its use as a diagnostic tool. If it is intended as an immediate follow up to another mydriatic drug (cocaine or apraclonidine), then the patient must wait anywhere from a day to a week before 4-hydroxyamphetamine can be administered. It also has the tendency to falsely localize lesions. False localization can arise in cases of acute onset; in cases where a postganglionic lesion is present, but the nerve still responds to residual norepinephrine; or in cases in which unrelated nerve damage masks the presence of a preganglionic lesion. Pharmacology Like amphetamine, 4-hydroxyamphetamine is an agonist of human TAAR1. 4-Hydroxyamphetamine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic and causes the release of norepinephrine from nerve synapses which leads to mydriasis (pupil dilation). It decreases metabolism of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and certain other monoamines by inhibiting the activity of a family of enzymes called monoamine oxidases (MAOs), particularly type A (MAO-A). The inhibition of MAO-A prevents metabolism of serotonin and catecholamines in the presynaptic terminal, and thus increases the amount of neurotransmitters available for release into the synaptic cleft. 4-Hydroxyamphetamine is a major metabolite of amphetamine and a minor metabolite of methamphetamine. In humans, amphetamine is metabolized to 4-hydroxyamphetamine by CYP2D6, which is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and is found in the liver. 4-Hydroxyamphetamine is then metabolized by dopamine beta-hydroxylase into 4-hydroxynorephedrine or eliminated in the urine. Commercialization Hydroxyamphetamine is a component of two controlled (prescription only), name- brand ophthalmic mydriatics: Paredrine and Paremyd. Paredrine consists of a 1% solution of hydroxyamphetamine hydrobromideSlamovits TL and JS Glaser. 'The Pupils and Accommodation.\\" in Neuro-ophthamology, ed Glaser JS. Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins; Philadelphia, PA, 1999. while Paremyd consists of a combination of 1% hydroxyamphetamine hydrobromide and 0.25% tropicamide. In the 1990s, the trade name rights, patents, and new drug applications (NDAs) for the two formulations were exchanged among a few different manufacturers after a shortage of the raw material required for their production, which caused both drugs to be indefinitely removed from the market.Akorn press release.

Subjects are taught in small groups based on students' ability levels. On average, the student-teacher ratio is between 6:1 and 14:1.http://madronaschool.com/commitments-to- learning/http://www.ourkids.net/school/madrona-school-society-vancouver/605 Currently, the school offers Kindergarten through Grade 9.  History  Madrona was established in 1993 in the Arbutus Walk area of Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood. In 2002, it moved to the Fairview neighbourhood. It moved a second time in 2008, back to Arbutus Walk. In September 2012, Madrona opened its Primary Annex (Kindergarten to Grade 3) at 2678 West Broadway, a location shared with Pear Tree Education. Madrona left 2678 West Broadway in June 2016. It divided its students between two campuses, Madrona West, located at 2040/2050 West 10th (Kindergarten to Grade 5), and Madrona Downtown, located at 530 Hornby Street (Grades 6 to 10). Madrona Downtown later closed, and Madrona West has been expanded into neighboring 2070 West 10th.  Governance  The Madrona School Society Board of Directors has the authority and responsibility to supervise the management of the affairs of the Society to ensure its continued well-being. The Board oversees the strategy, the budget and financial controls, and sets the overarching policies for the operation and control of the school.  Madrona West Campus  The Madrona West campus is located in Kitsilano, at 2040/2050/2070 West 10th Avenue. This campus houses Kindergarten to Grade 9 (Formerly K-5 before Downtown Campus closed.). A recent 2019 renovation included connecting 2040 and 2050, interior work, and a brand new Administration building, in 2070 (purchased in renovation).  Madrona Downtown Campus  Madrona's previous sister campus location was downtown, at 530 Hornby Street. The Madrona Downtown campus housed Grades 6 to 10. It was sold around 2016, but there are no online records.  Approach to Learning  Madrona's uniquely low ratio of child per educator allows staff to really get to know the students and their families. Madrona puts a strong emphasis on feelings of safety and security so that students feel they are heard and understood. Students are grouped based on their readiness, interest, learning style, and social-emotional skills. This means children can work at varying grade levels in different subjects. Some may accelerate in some areas while needing extra help in others. Teaching methods and subject matter are diverse to suit the unique interests of the student body. Yoga, computer programming, photography, math, music, textiles, and media literacy might all be part of a child's education in a given week. Madrona uses technology to enhance children's learning experiences. Students are provided with tablets for research and writing, and teachers integrate Smart Boards in classroom instruction. As a result, children become technologically savvy learners, come to see digital devices as tools rather than toys, and learn how to use online spaces safely and effectively. Madrona seeks to foster a child-centered learning environment. Students are encouraged to follow their interests and grow into a sense of responsibility and active participation in their education. Madrona focuses on building student autonomy in learning.http://www.ourkids.net/school/madrona-school-society-vancouver/605  Curriculum  Madrona is a Group 2 independent school. It delivers the BC curriculum focusing on the new curriculum in particular. \\"Essential learning, literacy and numeracy foundations, and core competencies are the base of [the] new curriculum. All three contribute to deeper learning.\\" In addition to the regular curriculum, students study current events, art, music, and drama,http://madronaschool.com/intermediate-program/ and take part in an interdisciplinary technology program covering subjects such as digital art and photography, computer programming, textiles, outdoor education, robotics, and web application development.http://madronaschool.com/interdisciplinary- technology-program/  Sports  Madrona is yet to have a BC School Sports certified team, However they are eligible (for some sports) An issue is the lack of a gym, which eliminates the possibility for many sports such as Basketball or Volleyball. Although there is no sports team they have participated in several Track & Field contests in recent years, and have had several talented young athletes learn at Madrona. Madrona students get Physical Education class twice weekly in which they often go to Connaught Park, where they frequently play sports such as US Football and Soccer, Students also play there during there lunch break.

The species is of concern because of its ability to produce a toxin, prymnesin. It is a flagellated alga that is normally found suspended in the water column. It was first identified in North America in 1985 and it is not known if it was introduced artificially (e.g., an invasive species or missed in previous surveys). Toxin production mainly kills fish and appears to have little effect on cattle or humans. This distinguishes it from red tide, which are algal bloom whose toxins lead to harmful effects in people. Although no harmful effects are known, it is recommended not to consume dead or dying fish exposed to a P. parvum bloom. Prymnesium parvum of Haptophyta is sometimes termed a golden alga or a golden brown algae as is Chrysophyceae of Heterokontophyta but the taxonomy of algae is under complex revision leading to contradictions in terms especially in non scholarly texts such as those from state wildlife departments.  Biology  P. parvum grows in a salinity range of 0.5 - 30 psu (Practical Salinity Unit) with an optimum at 15 psu although strains collected in different places appear to have different salinity tolerances. A strain called LB 2797 (isolated from Colorado River in Texas) shows a biphasic growth pattern namely, maximum cell densities increased as salinity increased from 5 to 15 psu but decreased at higher levels in laboratory culture. The alga produces dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and other unknown polyols, likely as an adaptation to osmoregulation. The environment must be between and for P. parvum to live. Growth at a pH of as low as 5.8 has been observed, but cells typically prefer higher pH ranges. The organism prefers highly light environments, but growth can be inhibited by excessive light (photoinhibition). The organism is capable of heterotrophic growth in the dark in the presence of glycerol and grazes on bacteria, especially when phosphate is limited. It has therefore been hypothesized that P. parvum satisfies its phosphate needs by consuming bacteria. P. parvum can use a wide range of nitrogen sources, including ammonium, nitrate, amino acids (which ones apparently depends of pH), creatine, but is unable to use urea. New evidence has shown that the toxins produced by this alga are induced by physiological stresses, such as nitrogen and phosphorus depletion due to competition with the environment.

Universytet () is a station on the Kyiv Metro's Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line. The station was opened on November 6, 1960 as part of the first stage of the metro's construction.Kyiv Metro Subway celebrates 58th anniversary on Nov 6, UNIAN (6 November 2018) It is named after the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, which is located in direct proximity to the station itself. Architecture The station is a pylon trivault and is considered to be amongst the most beautiful stations in the system, and is currently the only one in Kyiv that is the closest in appearance to the famous Stalinist architecture used in the Moscow and Saint Petersburg Metros of the 1950s. It was designed by architects H.Holovka, M.Syrkin, Ye.Ivanov, Zh.Yegulashvili, L.Semenyuk and O.Lozynska. The red marbled pylons are adorned with white marble busts of famous scientists and Ukrainian literature poets, attributed to sculptors M.Dekermendzhi, A.Bilostotsky, V.Znoba, A.Kobalyov, Ye.Kuntsevych, M.Lysenko, P.Ostapenko, O.Suprun and A.Shapran. The white marble friezes also decorate the pylons and lighting is achieved by hidden lamps in the niches of the central vault, and by lamps on the platforms. The walls are covered with orange tiles and the floor is made of various shades of granite arranged in a traditional Ukrainian ornament layout. In the end of the station is white marbled wall, before which a large statue of Vladimir Lenin used to sit. However this was dismantled in the early 1990s, making the station lose its original look. The station's large vestibule (monument to architecture) is situated in the middle of the A.V. Fomin Botanical Garden with a gallery allowing direct access to the gardens or to Taras Shevchenko Boulevard. The escalator ride consists of two separate tunnels linked in between by a smaller hall. 2011 Bomb Scare On April 15, 2011 a suspicious package was discovered at Universytet. The station was evacuated and Ukrainian Security Services investigated, determining that the package was not dangerous. The scare followed the April 11th 2011 Minsk Metro bombing.

The song begins with a male choir and orchestral background music for a full minute before the band starts playing. \\"Planet Hell\\" also heavily features the vocals of the band's bass player Marco Hietala.  Religious references  The song has a number of religious references: * \\"The ferryman\\" refers to Charon the ferryman in Greek mythology. (\\"Save yourself a penny for the ferryman\\": tradition dictated that a dead Greek would have a coin placed in his mouth to pay for passage over the River Styx, as Charon demanded payment to ferry souls across the Styx, and without payment, souls would be forever trapped upon the shores, unable to cross.) * \\"The Ark\\" could possibly refer to one of two things: The Ark of the Covenant, or Noah's Ark. The latter seems the most plausible, as in Biblical story the Ark saved Noah and the animals from the flood brought about by God for their sins. \\"This world ain't ready for the Ark\\" could indeed be a dark message from the band stating that the Earth is in midst of destruction by humans and we are all to blame, and deserve punishment. * \\"Mother Gaia\\" refers to the Greek Titan Gaia or Mother Earth.  In popular culture  * This song is well known amongst players of the fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game RuneScape. On June 6, 2006, a massive bug occurred in the game, known as the Falador Massacre, which allowed some players to attack others in areas that were meant to be safe zones. Players were attacked and lost their valuable items. One player recorded the bug being abused and it served as the main video of the event. The video he made featured the song Planet Hell as the background music. On June 6, 2016, makers of the game, Jagex, released a special event celebrating the ten year anniversary of the Falador Massacre. They remastered their own version of Planet Hell which was featured in the game as a background song. * This song was also used as intro music by the San Antonio Spurs in 2005.
