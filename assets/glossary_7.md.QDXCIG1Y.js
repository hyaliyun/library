The son of Henry Bompas, a County Court judge, he was born at Hampstead in December 1881. He was educated at Westminster School, before going up to Pembroke College, Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge, Bompas played first-class cricket. He made his first-class debut for the personal XI of A. J. Webbe against Cambridge University in 1901. In that same season he played for Cambridge University against the touring South Africans, in addition to playing twice for London County against the Marylebone Cricket Club and Derbyshire. Having not played first-class cricket in 1902, he played three times for Cambridge University in 1903. Despite scoring 109 and 59 in his freshman match of 1901, Bompas was unable to carry that form into first-class cricket and scored just 35 runs from 11 batting innings', though as a wicket- keeper he did take 5 catches and make 4 stumpings. A student of the Inner Temple, he was called to the bar to practice as a barrister in 1904. After practicing on the South Eastern Circuit, Bompas enlisted during the First World War in the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) as a flight sub-lieutenant in May 1915. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in June 1916, with the RNAS merging with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force in April 1918. In September 1918, Bompas held the rank of captain which he held until the end of the war and the relinquishment of his commission in April 1919. Following the war, he chose not to return to practice as a barrister and instead became a civil servant with the Ministry of Labour from 1919‚Äì25 and the Secretary for Education to the Dental Board from 1925. He died at Chelsea in July 1944.

Kinematics  Kinematics is the study of how objects move, whether they are mechanical or living. In animal locomotion, kinematics is used to describe the motion of the body and limbs of an animal. The goal is ultimately to understand how the movement of individual limbs relates to the overall movement of an animal within its environment. Below highlights the key kinematic parameters used to quantify body and limb movement for different modes of animal locomotion.  Study of walking  Legged locomotion is a dominant form of terrestrial locomotion, the movement on land. The motion of limbs is quantified by intralimb and interlimb kinematic parameters. Intralimb kinematic parameters capture movement aspects of an individual limb, whereas, interlimb kinematic parameters characterize the coordination across limbs. Interlimb kinematic parameters are also referred to as gait parameters. The following are key intralimb and interlimb kinematic parameters of walking: Intralimb kinematic parameters: _Anterior Extreme Position (AEP)_ : position of the leg when it first contacts the ground (i.e. start of stance phase). _Posterior Extreme Position (PEP)_ : position of the leg when it first lifts off of the ground (i.e. start of swing phase). _Stride duration:_ elapsed time between two onsets of stance. _Stride frequency:_ inverse of stride duration. The number of strides within a second. _Stance duration:_ time elapsed between stance onset (i.e. AEP) and swing onset (i.e. PEP). _Swing duration:_ time elapsed between swing onset (i.e. PEP) and the subsequent stance onset (i.e. AEP). _Stride length:_ the distance a leg travels between stance onset (i.e. AEP) and swing onset (i.e. PEP). _Stride amplitude:_ the distance a leg travels between swing onset (i.e. PEP) and the subsequent stance onset (i.e. AEP), while also accounting for the movement of the body. Interlimb kinematic parameters: _Step length:_ the distance from the stance onset of a reference leg to its contralateral counterpart. _Phase:_ the lag of a leg relative to the stride period of a reference leg. _Number of legs in stance:_ The number of legs in stance at a single point in time. _Tripod coordination strength (TCS):_ specific to hexapod interlimb coordination, this parameter determines how much the interlimb coordination resembles the canonical tripod gait. TCS is calculated as the ratio of the total time legs belonging to a tripod (i.e. left front, middle right, and hing left legs, or vice versa) are in swing together, by the time elapsed between the first leg of the tripod that enters swing and the last leg of the same tripod that exits swing. = Flight = Aerial locomotion is a form of movement used by many organisms and is typically powered by at least one pair of wings. Some organisms, however, have other morphological features that allow them to glide. There are many different flight modes, such as takeoff, hovering, soaring, and landing. Quantifying wing movements during these flight modes will provide insight about the body and wing maneuvers that are required to execute these behaviors. Wing orientation is quantified throughout the flight cycle by three angles that are defined in a coordinate system relative to the base of the wing. The magnitude of these three angles are often compared for upstrokes and downstrokes. In addition, kinematic parameters are used to characterize the flight cycle, which consists of an upstroke and a downstroke. Aerodynamics are often considered when quantifying aerial locomotion, as aerodynamic forces (e.g. lift or drag) are able to influence flight performance.. Key parameters from these three categories are defined as follows: Angles to quantify wing orientation: Wing orientation is described in the coordinate system centered at the wing hinge. The x-y plane coincides with the stroke plane, the plane parallel to the plane that contains both wing tips and is centered at the wing base. Assuming the wing can modeled by the vector passing through the wing base and wing tip, the following angles describe the orientation of the wing: _Stroke position:_ angle describing the anterior-to-posterior motion of the wings relative to the stroke plane. This angle is computed as the projection of the wing vector onto the stroke plane. _Stroke deviation:_ angle describing the vertical amplitude of the wings relative to the stroke plane. This angle is defined as the angle between the wing vector and its projection onto the stroke plane. _Angle of attack:_ angular orientation of the wings (i.e. tilt) relative to the stroke plane. This angle is computed as the angle between the wing cross section vector and the stroke plane. Kinematic parameters: _Upstroke amplitude:_ angular distance through which the wings travel during an upstroke. _Downstroke amplitude:_ angular distance through which the wings travel during a downstroke. _Stroke duration:_ time elapsed between the onset of two consecutive upstrokes. _Wingbeat frequency:_ inverse of stroke duration. The number of wingbeats per second. _Flight distance per wingbeat:_ the distance covered during each wingbeat. _Upstroke duration:_ time elapsed between the onset of an upstroke and the onset of a downstroke. _Downstroke duration:_ time elapsed between the onset of a downstroke and the onset of an upstroke. _Phase:_ if an organism has both front and hind wings, the lag of a wing pair relative to the other (reference) wing pair. Aerodynamic parameters: _Reynolds number:_ ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. This metric helps describe how wing performance changes with body size. Methods of study Documentary film, shot at 1200 fps, used to study the locomoton of a cheetah. The end of the video shows the methods used for filming. Simultaneous measurement of ground forces (blue) and kinematics such as petiole trajectories (red) and stepping pattern (yellow) of walking desert ants in a laboratory environment in order to describe the alternating tripod gait. Recording rate: 500 fps, Playback rate: 10 fps. A variety of methods and equipment are used to study animal locomotion: * Treadmills are used to allow animals to walk or run while remaining stationary or confined with respect to external observers. This technique facilitates filming or recordings of physiological information from the animal (e.g., during studies of energetics). Motorized treadmills are also used to measure the endurance capacity (stamina) of animals. * Racetracks lined with photocells or filmed while animals run along them are used to measure acceleration and maximal sprint speed. * High-speed videography for the study of the motion of an entire animal or parts of its body (i.e. Kinematics). It is typically accomplished by placing visual markers at particular anatomical locations on the animal and then recording video of its movement. The video is often captured from multiple angles, with frame rates exceeding 2000 frames per second when capturing high speed movement. The location of each marker is determined for each video frame, and data from multiple views is integrated to give positions of each point through time. Computers are sometimes used to track the markers, although this task must often be performed manually. The kinematic data can be used to determine fundamental motion attributes such as velocity, acceleration, joint angles, and the sequencing and timing of kinematic events. These fundamental attributes can be used to quantify various higher level attributes, such as the physical abilities of the animal (e.g., its maximum running speed, how steep a slope it can climb), neural control of locomotion, gait, and responses to environmental variation. These, in turn, can aid in formulation of hypotheses about the animal or locomotion in general. * Force plates are platforms, usually part of a trackway, that can be used to measure the magnitude and direction of forces of an animal's step. When used with kinematics and a sufficiently detailed model of anatomy, inverse dynamics solutions can determine the forces not just at the contact with the ground, but at each joint in the limb. * Electromyography (EMG) is a method of detecting the electrical activity that occurs when muscles are activated, thus determining which muscles an animal uses for a given movement. This can be accomplished either by surface electrodes (usually in large animals) or implanted electrodes (often wires thinner than a human hair). Furthermore, the intensity of electrical activity can correlate to the level of muscle activity, with greater activity implying (though not definitively showing) greater force. * Sonomicrometry employs a pair of piezoelectric crystals implanted in a muscle or tendon to continuously measure the length of a muscle or tendon. This is useful because surface kinematics may be inaccurate due to skin movement. Similarly, if an elastic tendon is in series with the muscle, the muscle length may not be accurately reflected by the joint angle. * Tendon force buckles measure the force produced by a single muscle by measuring the strain of a tendon. After the experiment, the tendon's elastic modulus is determined and used to compute the exact force produced by the muscle. However, this can only be used on muscles with long tendons. * Particle image velocimetry is used in aquatic and aerial systems to measure the flow of fluid around and past a moving aquatic organism, allowing fluid dynamics calculations to determine pressure gradients, speeds, etc. * Fluoroscopy allows real-time X-ray video, for precise kinematics of moving bones. Markers opaque to X-rays can allow simultaneous tracking of muscle length. These methods can be combined. For example, studies frequently combine EMG and kinematics to determine motor pattern, the series of electrical and kinematic events that produce a given movement.

It is characterised by questioning Montenegrins as a separate nation with own culture, heritage, language and identity. Examples of Anti- Montenegrin sentiment =Serbia= After the dissolution of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and the Montenegrin independence that followed, Serbian influence has become more and more apparent. Serbia wields its media influence to spread narratives and disinformation, employing bombastic headlines regarding Montenegro‚Äôs development as a country. Serbia also exerts its influence through a church in Montenegro: the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral, which is the largest eparchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Outside of these vectors for influence, the relationship between the two countries is generally cooperative, with ongoing collaboration on many other matters. Serbian tourists visit Montenegro in large numbers. In summer 2019, for example, upwards of 460,000 Serbian tourists visited the country. Because of the tourism industry‚Äôs significant importance as a means of national income and the intense Serbian interest in vacationing in the country, the industry is high on the list of targets against which Serbian media spread disinformation, especially in the lead up to the summer season. Many articles from Serbian outlets cast Montenegro as an expensive and unsafe tourist destination with dirty beaches and aggressive locals, featuring headlines such as: ‚ÄúTourists massively cancel their vacations in Montenegro‚Äù and ‚ÄúSnakes came out from the sea and went after people on the Buljarica beach.‚Äù Similar propaganda has been observed in prior years, but so far it has not impacted the number of Serbian visitors or the overall tourism economy. City of Vrbas does not allow official usage of Montenegrin language, although it had constitutional obligation to implement it. So far, the only municipality in Serbia where Montenegrin has the status of official language is Mali Iƒëo≈°. On 2 January 2020, in Belgrade were organised protests in front of Montenegrin embassy, resulting the burning of Montenegrin flag and writing anti-Montenegrin graffiti. Serbian Minister of Healh Zlatibor Lonƒçar claimed that there are too many Montenegrins and that he tends not to have Montenegrins working in Serbian institutions. Kosta Cavoski of SANU gave instructions for reducing Montenegrins in 2021 cenzus in Montenegro and in Serbia. Similar opinion on the essence of 2021 cenzus was provided by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. In Serbia, according to cenzus, the number of Montenegrins in Serbia has been reduced from 120.438 in 1981 to only 38.527 in 2011. In 2020, Happy TV and TV Pink S were suspended from broadcasting on Montenegrin cable TV by Regulatory media authority for 3 months because their talk-show programs they promoted hatred speach, intolerance and discrimination against members of the Montenegrin nationality. =Republic of Srpska= The rhetoric used during the June 2020 plenary session of the National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska consisted of plenty of nationalistic and anti- Montenegrin positions, along with heavy insults against the highest officials of our state, which most certainly do not contribute to good neighbourly and friendly relations. =Serbian Orthodox Church= Since the nineties, religious figures of Serbian Orthodox Church, including Amfilohije and Irinej dispute existence of Montenegrins as a nation, calling them \\"the bastards of Milovan Djilas\\". Also, Serbian Orthodox Church actively criticise the existence of Montenegrin language, calling it as an artificial one. =Russia= Russia has meddled in Montenegrin politics as well as Economics. The most glaring example was an attempted coup in October 2016, which appeared to be the work of a Russian-backed opposition coalition in Montenegro ‚Äî the Democratic Front ‚Äî and the GRU, according to analysis conducted by Bellingcat and The Insider. Ultimately, the High Court of Montenegro found two Russian citizens, nine Serbian citizens, and three politicians from the Democratic Front guilty of the failed plot. Throughout Montenegro‚Äôs NATO integration process, Russian influence has included diplomatic reactions and media attacks against the government, import bans on Montenegrin state-owned winemaker Planta≈æe, and a boycott by pro-Russian opposition parties of the 2017 NATO membership ratification vote in parliament. But that was not the end of it. In March 2017, Russian state media outlet Rossiya 1 released a short documentary claiming that Montenegro was ‚Äúdangerous for Russian tourists, with a high risk of contracting infectious diseases,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúdirty beaches, minefields, and political instability, followed by arrests of Russian citizens for unknown reasons.‚Äù Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued the negative campaign, citing ‚Äúa surge of anti-Russian hysteria there (Montenegro)‚Äù and stating, ‚ÄúWe note the growth of a negative attitude towards Russian business and our compatriots. We do not exclude possible provocations, detention for dubious reasons, attempts to extradite Russian citizens to third countries, especially the United States.‚Äù The Russian Federal Tourism Agency used the same line of attack when it urged tour operators to inform customers of the ‚Äúunfavorable situation‚Äù for Russians in Montenegro. Despite these negative narratives on the part of the Russian government, the year ended with more than three million overnight stays in Montenegro by Russian tourists. =Wikipedia= Project of Montenegrin language Wikipedia has been actively rejected by the LangCom due to absence of language code for Montenegrin language. In 2017, the language code has been granted, CNR incubator started, however, still the Montenegrin Wikipedia project is being rejected with active pressure of the Serbia-based administrators. By Serbian media, Montenegrin Wikipedia is commented as \\"written by Ante Pavelic, (Croatian Fascist leader)\\" In English Wikipedia, several pages that derogate Montenegrin nation have been created, such as \\" Controversy over ethnic and linguistic identity in Montenegro \\", which actively show the Serbian propaganda tools.

The son of Edward Studd and his second wife, Dorothy, he was born in November 1863 at Billesdon, Leicestershire. He was educated at Eton College, before going up to King's College, Cambridge. Although he did not play first-class cricket for Cambridge University Cricket Club, he did play for A. J. Webbe's personal XI against Cambridge University in 1885. He graduated from Cambridge in 1888, having played three first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club during his final year, in addition to making a fourth appearance for the MCC in 1888. In five first-class matches, Studd scored 104 runs with a high score of 47. He played minor matches for Hampshire in 1888, then considered a second-class county. Studd's main interest was art and he studied in Paris in at the Acad√©mie Julian in 1888‚Äì89. He met and befriended Paul Gauguin in 1890 and in 1892 he met the artist James McNeill Whistler, with the two becoming neighbours in 1894 when they moved to Chelsea, London. He travelled with Gauguin to Papeete in Tahiti in 1897‚Äì98. He later acquired a number of Whistler's works, leaving them to the Tate Galley. Studd himself exhibited his own art regularly in the first decade of the 1900s, with some his works also held by the Tate Gallery. Studd's brothers, known colloquially as the Studd brothers, all played first-class cricket. Studd died at Marylebone in January 1919.

She was originally a merchant ship's lifeboat or dinghy, stored on board and normally called \\"the boat\\" in that era. The 1870 east-west trip between Ireland and the United States was crewed by John Charles Buckley, a middle-aged Irishman with seagoing experience, and Primorac, a Croatian and tobacconist. The crew on the west‚Äìeast return trip of 1871 were Primorac and a \\"lad\\" called Edwin Richard William Hayter from New Zealand, who had been a steward on the steamer City of Limerick of the Inman Line. Following each trip, the ship and crew were the subject of much international public attention, and President Grant viewed the City of Ragusa after she reached America. From 1872, the ship was exhibited in various places in England including the Crystal Palace, and finally at Liverpool Museum where she was destroyed in 1941 when Liverpool was bombed. After the adventure, Primorac resumed his life as a tobacconist in Liverpool, and ultimately died in Rainhill Asylum. Hayter returned to New Zealand, and Buckley made at least one other ocean adventuring trip at the end of 1871: a cargo-ship race involving the Hypathia. Ship =Yawl City of Ragusa= Details of the ship, and signatures of Buckley and Primorac, on the back of Buckley's photo, 1870 The City of Ragusa of Liverpool, no. 2,020, was originally an ex-ship's clinker-built lifeboat or ship-to-shore ferry, normally stored onboard and called \\"the boat.\\" By 1870 the boat had been decked, and yawl-rigged which allowed \\"square sails on both masts, spreading altogether seventy yards of canvas, in eight or nine sails.\\" Before the mizzen mast was a windmill which powered a two-bladed screw propeller. Should the wind fail, the screw could be powered by hand; it could also be raised to prevent reef-damage. The same hand-worked mechanism also pumped water out of the ship. Her tanks took of fresh water, and she could carry three months' victuals. At this point she was described as a ship (albeit \\"diminutive\\") by the Press. She was \\"strongly built, double-floored inside, and [was] decked over, leaving a small cockpit aft, so that there [was] a cabin wide, and high from floor to roof.\\" She was double-floored and had a ballast of of iron, a condenser for distilling drinking water from saltwater, and there was coal on board, although cooking was done with a spirit lamp. The 1870 yawl conversion was undertaken in Liverpool under the supervision of J.C. Buckley, who received much local support in the form of victualling for the expedition. The Graphic reported: \\"The City of Ragusa is the smallest vessel ever cleared at the Liverpool Custom House, and the gentleman who performed that duty for her also cleared the Great Eastern.\\" The ship carried the English ensign in 1870, and the US ensign in 1871. Throughout the two transatlantic trips, the ship had the option for one square sail on the main mast, and all the rest would be gaff sails, plus staysail and jib. According to the Cork Daily Herald in June 1871, \\"She is yawl rigged, and returns to Ireland just as she left it, except that a gaff topsail is added, and that her sails have been enlarged. She bears all the traces of her long passage, being coated green with what sailors call \\"sea grass.\\" In 1872, following the 1871 transatlantic crossing, the ship was exhibited at Crystal Palace, but there was an accident. When lowering the ship to allow visitor boarding, the jackscrew holding the stern gave way, and the keel fell on Primorac's leg, causing a compound fracture. No help came. Hayter managed to lift the boat little by little, as Primorac gradually inserted wood under the keel. Primorac, bleeding profusely, was eventually taken to Guy's Hospital. The ship was acquired by Mrs Simms, and was displayed at the Royal Castle Hotel, Chester Road, Tranmere, Merseyside. She then presented it to Birkenhead Park for use on the lakes. Following repairs, the ship \\"remained a prominent feature in the lower park for some years.\\" On 22 July 1875 \\"a small boat with red bottom and two top strakes painted white, name on stern City of Ragusa, Liverpool,\\" was picked up by Captain Hewett of the schooner Success, off Douglas Head. The ship was later displayed in the Liverpool Museum, until it was destroyed by a bomb in 1941. =Mother-ship Breeze= The 20-foot City of Ragusa originated as the boat of a ship named Breeze which had been lost in the Irish Channel at some time before 1870. It was possibly from the brig, Breeze, which foundered in a storm in the Irish Channel or Irish Sea. The Illustrated London News said that this boat was employed to save fourteen crew by ferrying them through bad weather to the Isle of Man. There were several ships of that name, which foundered during the decades before 1870. One story says that Breeze was a whaler which was lost in November 1869. The brigantine Breeze 42,819, of Liverpool, skippered by Davidson and owned by J.S. Detvoy & Co., of Liverpool and H. Smith of Douglas, Isle of Man, was wrecked off Ramsey, Isle of Man, on 12 November 1869, but she was not a whaler. She was carrying coal from Liverpool to Trinidad, when she \\"shipped a sea ... and was abandoned in a sinking state, about 3 leagues south of Mangold Head.\\" The eight-man crew escaped in the ship's lifeboat, landing near the Point of Ayr. The wreckage washed ashore a month later at Workington. \\"The men saved but a small portion of their clothing, and the captain lost everything except the ship's papers. She was not insured.\\" At Ramsay they were assisted by the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society. The fate of their lifeboat was not mentioned by the Isle of Man Times which reported this. On 28 May 1860, the 102 ton brigantine Breeze of London, carrying pig iron from Ardrossan to Llanelly, was damaged in a hurricane off Wicklow Head. The foremast fell sideways, damaging the ship so she took in water. The steamship Vasco de Gama began to tow her towards Holyhead in a high sea, but Breeze was filling with water and the skipper cast off the towrope. Captain Ducat of the Vasco de Gama and his crew, using their own boat, made several heroic rescues of the crew of the Breeze, saving five people but losing one boy. The brigantine was lost. The de Gama crew were later rewarded for their bravery by the Board of Trade Marine Department. Another possibility is that it could be the brig, Breeze of Sunderland, bound from Alexandria to Lytham St Annes, which ran aground south of Lytham in 1858.\\"Ship News\\". The Times (22925). London. 24 February 1858. col F, p. 11. When grounded she was carrying wheat, and was described as \\"grounded on a middle bank,\\" being left \\"at high water, straining.\\" She was an A1, British-built, 165-ton clipper brig; a cargo vessel previously skippered by Captain Murdoch between Buenos Aires and George's Dock, England. Transatlantic crossings =Liverpool to Boston, 1870= On 2 June 1870 the City of Ragusa, crewed by Captain John Charles Buckley and Nikola Primorac, left Liverpool for New York. Between Liverpool and Queenstown, County Cork they hand-wound the propeller once. The log said: \\"Shipped propeller and worked it by hand for six hours, and gained thereby two knots per hour.\\" They stopped en route between 12 and 16 June at Queenstown due to the stuffing box of the prop shaft leaking, and they probably removed the windmill gear from above decks at that point. The trip had its share of pranks from the public. For example, on 12 June 1870, a bottle was found on the shore near Bootle. It contained a message in pencil, saying: \\"City of Ragusa June 4th 1870. Off the coast of Ireland making for Waterford. Captain Buckley washed overboard.\\" The document was taken to the police office, but when the Ragusa arrived at Queenstown on 12 July the note was recognised as a forgery. The ship arrived at Cork on 18 June, becoming the \\"centre of attraction\\" there. Buckley did not mind the attention, but Primorac tended to lose patience, \\"and for all the visitors knew might have more than once consigned them to all sorts of future pains and sufferings.\\" The Press monitored the ship's progress via reports from transatlantic vessels which spoke her at sea. For example, the Cunard SS Russia, and SS Abyssinia, spoke her on 13 August, off the Banks of Newfoundland. At that point, Primorac was introducing himself as \\"Antonio Romano, a native of Ragusa.\\" According to the log, on one day of the passage, the Ragusa ran ; the slowest day covered . They had a dog on board, but it died on 29 August. They reached Boston on 8 September, the 1870 Atlantic crossing having taken 92 or 98 days. \\"There were strong westerly winds almost from the beginning of the journey, and two or three heavy gales.\\" The Cork Constitution reported that: > All things considered, she made a capital voyage across the Atlantic, and > became the admiration of the nautical men of New York. No doubt was cast on > the voyage of the City of Ragusa, and Captain Buckley reaped the full reward > of the honours he had earned by his enterprising and extraordinary voyage. > Whatever may have been the object or intent of the voyage of the tiny craft, > one thing would seem certain as already published, that Capt. Buckley with > his man reached the harbour of New York without aid or assistance. Ragusa suffering a \\"serious leakage\\", the crew took her to Boston for repairs first, then to New York, where she remained on exhibition over winter. The ship continued to attract attention for a while, then Buckley returned to Liverpool by steamer. He said \\"he [was] glad the journey [was] over, and, although he never had any serious doubts about being successful, he [did] not care to undertake the experiment again. In 1878 Hayter wrote to The Times to say, > The City of Ragusa was visited in America by President Grant and all the > State officials of Boston and by the Governor and ex-Governor of Rhode > Island, and was seen by Admiral Northcott and many other officers of Her > Majesty's Navy and over 400,000 persons at the Crystal Palace. She ... now > lies at Liverpool ... I hope next year to have her on view at my boat house > [at Maidenhead]. E.R.W. Hayter. =New York to Liverpool, 1871= SS City of Limerick on which E.R.W. Hayter served before shipping with the City of Ragusa After Buckley returned to Liverpool from New York in 1870, Primorac remained with the ship as Captain, looking for a replacement mate for the return trip to Ireland. The first potential crew member agreed to take the job on 20 May 1871, but when he saw the size of the ship he mutinied and left. A second man was offered the position, but he \\"refused his duty\\" in the same manner. Primorac then took on Edwin Hayter. The Cork Daily Herald gives another view of those events: > [Buckley's] retirement elevated his crew Primorez - to the position of > captain, and this brave man spent the entire spring in cruising about New > York and up the Hudson, and to the principal cities on that part of the > coast, where extreme anxiety existed amongst the people for a glimpse at the > extraordinary craft. No better idea of her apparent sea going powers could > be gleaned from anything than the fact that four experienced sailors who > were successively engaged to work her under the directions of Capt. > Primorez, and who were anxious to give her a trial. left her on a trip up > the Albany river, as they became afraid to risk their lives in her, even in > the smooth inland waters. This time the Ragusa was ballasted with \\"a kind of new patent American brick,\\" which Primorac wanted to exhibit at the London Exhibition. At 5am on 23 May 1871 the crew let go the Sandy Hook pilot and started for Queenstown with a northerly heading. The New York Herald called it a \\"foolhardy adventure,\\" and said, \\"with the exception of the bark of the dog, she is probably the smallest bark that ever attempted such a trip.\\" This return trip took 36 days. The Cork Constitution reported: > During the voyage the weather was rather rough, and at times squally, but > the tiny craft kept on her course well, making an average in good weather > seven knots, and in bad weather 4.5 knots per hour. Her best speed, and one > extraordinary for so small a boat, was 160 miles on the third day after > leaving her moorings. The log of her voyage could not be obtained, and many > statements have been made respecting her voyage, none of which it would be > safe to give as representing the whole facts. On [22 June 1871] the little > craft made 120 knots during the day, which was the second-best day's running > since her starting. The Illustrated Police News reported: > Bad weather set in off the banks of Newfoundland, and for ten days a series > of gales tossed them about in a terrific sea. The gale subsiding, the > captain was able to set his vessel's head to the eastward. Icebergs were > frequently seen in that latitude at that time, and a sharp look-out had to > be kept. The ice was avoided, and the ship continued her course. The weather > remained exceedingly heavy, and there were rare periods of calm. A > succession of heavy gales came on, and as it was impossible to take > observations the course was taken by dead reckoning throughout. From the > beginning to the end of the passage the captain saw the sun rise and set > only once, and during the remaining days the weather was too thick to permit > him to make observations ... off Fastnet ... they amused themselves with > catching a young shark. While following a piece of beef a noose was slipped > round his tail and he was pulled on board. His tail was hung at the > bowsprit, where it is still to be observed ... The captain has kept a > careful log of the whole voyage, which he intends publishing. The City of Ragusa arrived at Queenstown at midnight on Wednesday 28 June 1871, \\"firing a gun as she entered.\\" According to Primorac's report, he only had time to wash himself once during the voyage, but managed to change his clothes four times. He said that the pair took six-hour watches, but once during a gale Primorac did a thirty-hour watch. He added that they caught a shark near Fastnet, and indeed they arrived in harbour with what was left of the fish on board. That included the jaws, teeth and backbone. The Ragusa was flying the Austrian and British flags when she arrived. On 29 June \\"a number of people visited the little craft, and several boats laden with spectators sailed around her.\\" The Irish Daily Telegraph was one of those spectators: > We saw the little thing at Queenstown, but 19 feet long, and [1.75] tons > measurement, rocking to every wave of the passing stream, bending to every > puff of wind, which scarcely stirred the flags of her sisters around her; we > looked in wonder at her, and very few could realise that she had made two > long voyages across the Atlantic; had ridden out, off the coast of > Newfoundland, two severe storms; had seen large vessels dismasted, and > herself surrounded with the debris, which was more dangerous to her than the > contending elements.

The City of Ragusa left Queenstown for Liverpool on 10 July 1871.

By 1870 he was \\"middle-aged.\\" The Illustrated London News reported in 1870: > He formerly served in the army of the Papal Government and was taken > prisoner, in 1860, during the short campaign of Castelfidardo and Spoleto, > by the invading forces of King Victor Emmanuel. He served the Pope three > years, and is a Knight of the Order of St. Sylvester. He has since been the > officer of an American passenger-steamer, and lately master of a large > vessel in the China trade. He has been rewarded with the honorary silver > medal of the Humane Society for saving two lives on our coast near Hythe. At Trafalgar Square, London, on 12 January 1859 the Humane Society awarded J. Buckley of the Royal Limerick Militia a silver medal \\"for saving the lives of Sergeant M. Mahony and Private J. Bastow of the same corps ... who went to bathe in the sea, and venturing out too far would no doubt have met a watery grave, had not Buckley, after the most desperate exertions, succeeded iin bringing both of them ashore.\\" The rescue occurred on 22 September 1858 at Hythe, Kent. Unlike Primorac and Hayter, Buckley did not retire from adventure. He crewed under Captain Scott on the John S.D. Wolfe sailing ship Hypathia, which left the Mersey on 18 September 1871, arriving at Philadelphia after 37 days, beating the four ships which accompanied her. Leaving Philadelphia on 4 December for Havre, she encountered \\"terrific westerly gales\\" but reached her destination after 17 days. The trip involved running before the gale, with water sweeping the decks, hands lashed at the pumps, lifelines in use, and two men at the wheel.

He was Croatian, but when using the alias Pietro di Costa assumed Austrian-Italian identity. The Illustrated London News was informed that he had a wife and two children, but that they drowned as passengers on an Austrian merchant ship when it was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands, and that he was master of the ship at the time. Primorac had a dog, Boatswain, who accompanied him on the 1871 return crossing. The dog was described by the Illustrated Police News as a \\"splendid brindled Bull Terrier which bore all the suffering of the long journey with as much fortitude as his fellow passengers.\\" There were two dogs on the voyage; Hayter's Labrador was swept overboard, and Boatswain survived. However Primorac and Boatswain each came to an unfortunate end in Liverpool. On 27 December 1878, the Liverpool Mercury reported: > Yesterday forenoon, the inhabitants in the neighbourhood immediately > adjoining the Sailor‚Äôs Home [in Duke Street, Liverpool] were rather startled > by seeing a man rushing about the streets with loaded firearms, evidently > intent upon shooting some one. His name was found to be Nicholas Primoraz, > tobacconist and stationer, carrying on business at 56, Duke-street, and with > considerable difficulty he was secured and locked up.

This dog yesterday attempted to bite > a police constable who snatched a pistol from its master, and was afterwards > shot with the same weapon. The faithful animal was not killed by the shot, > but was afterwards drowned at the Jordan-street pinfold. According to the Liverpool Albion, Primorac was shooting at a man who in due course took over his tobacconist shop. On 16 January 1879 Primorac was incarcerated in Rainhill Asylum, and on 1 March 1886 he died there.

After the 1871 passage he spent some years in Maidenhead, Berkshire as a \\"boat owner and letter of boats on hire\\", then went bankrupt in 1879.

His parents were Richard-Joseph Avaert and L√©ocadie Monier. He attended school for army children, and joined the Belgian army on 6 September 1867. On 15 December 1873 he was appointed 2nd lieutenant in the infantry. He was seconded to the War Department on 25 December 1878. On 24 December 1879 he was promoted to lieutenant and assigned to the 5th line regiment. On 7 February 1882 he was authorized to enter the service of the International Association of the Congo. First term on the Congo (1882‚Äì1883) Avaert left Antwerp on 15 August 1882 with Camille Coquilhat, √âmile Parfonry and the accountant Brunfaut, and reached Banana on 22 September 1822. The group reached Vivi on 27 September 1882, where Alexander von Danckelman assigned Parfonry to Isangila, Avaert to Manyanga and Coquilhat to L√©opoldville and beyond. They traveled by land from Vivi and reached Isangila on 4 October 1882. On 11 October Avaert, , Martin, Louis-Gustave Amelot and Coquilhat took the steamer Royal up to Manyanga. Amelot fell sick and had to return. Avaert remained at Manyanga under the command of Th√©odore Nilis. He fell ill, but was treated with a combination of morphine and quinine by the Reverend William Holman Bentley of the Baptist Missionary Society, and was able to return to Isangila on the Royal. He later told Coquilhat that his life had been saved by these injections. Avaert was in Isangila when the overall commander Henry Morton Stanley returned, and appointed Avaert to stay in Isangila, which was to be the base for the Niari-Kwilu expedition led by Edmond Hanssens. Avaert engaged local workers from the nearby villages to build a house for Europeans on the plateau in front of a long avenue planted with banana trees. Avaert's health remained poor, and on 16 August 1883 he was replaced by . He returned via Vivi and Banana, reaching Belgium on 8 December 1883.

He left from Rotterdam on 15 February 1886 and reached Banana on 13 March 1886. He started off for Vivi, but was diverted to Boma, where the central administration of the new Congo Free State was being established. Avaert was made deputy to L√©on Roget to help organize the first contingent of the Force Publique from 75 Bangalas sent down to the lower Congo by Van Kerckhoven. He was also made an officer of the Court of Appeal, was given charge of the mission to Massabi in the Portuguese territory of Cabinda, and was assigned to direct the development of the caravan trail from Vivi to Manyanga. In December 1886, as assistant to Avaert, Camille Van den Plas took part in the expedition to Manyanga and was responsible for the evacuation of Vivi. Avaert left the Congo to return to Belgium in May 1887. He was promoted to captain on 26 March 1888.

He was assisted by lieutenants Fi√©vez, Debergh and Hanolet, 13 Belgian non-commissioned officers and soldiers, and 28 Hausa or Bangala instructors. He engaged in a successful action against the Mussorongo tribe, which had been looting factories in the Congo River delta. A battery of 7.5 cm cannon proved decisive. Avaert returned to Belgium in October 1889. Later career (1890‚Äì1923) Avaert was attached to the Ministry of Interior and sent on a special mission to Egypt on 27 May 1890.

An unknown assailant attacked two German tourists, Klaus Schelkle (aged 20) and Bettina Taxis (aged 22), killing the former and seriously injuring the latter. The crime remained unsolved for 33 years, until the Finnish police announced in September 2020 that they had determined the identity of the killer and were passing the case to prosecutors. Background Klaus Schelkle (born 28 January 1967) and Bettina Taxis (born 10 May 1965) were both students from West Germany, who had met earlier in 1987 and become romantically involved. Together with Schelkle's friend, Thomas Schmid, they had decided to tour the Nordic countries on an Interrail rail pass, with the aim of travelling from Germany up Stockholm, crossing over on a ferry to Turku, continuing up through Finland to Lapland, and returning back south along the coast of Norway. They sailed from Stockholm in the late evening of 27 July. They became acquainted with a number of their fellow passengers that night, including a young British man on his way to meet a Finnish woman he had met earlier, and a Finnish car parts dealer returning from a business trip in Germany. Schelkle and Taxis in particular were social and outgoing, while Schmid was not so interested in partying. The three had limited funds, which explains why on the night of the killings they did not have cabins on the ferry, instead sleeping in the public areas. The ship in question, MS Viking Sally, was part of the Viking Line ferry fleet, which provides daily cruise ferry services between Sweden, Finland and the √Öland islands. It had capacity for passengers and 400 vehicles, and a crew of approximately 200. The previous year, another passenger had been murdered on the same ship. Viking Sally later became MS Estonia, which in 1994 sank in the Baltic sea claiming hundreds of lives. Night of the incident In the early hours of 28 July, around 01:00, Schelkle and Taxis fetched their sleeping bags from inside the ship, where Schmid was asleep in a public area with the backpacks and other belongings of all three. The couple headed for the open- air 9th deck at the rear of the ship, where they had earlier identified a sheltered spot next to the ship's helipad. Their chosen location was dimly lit, due to a broken lamp. At approximately 03:45, a group of three Danish boy scouts, on their way to a jamboree in Finland, were wandering around the ship's decks, and chanced upon the victims' sleeping area. According to their witness statements they saw two people, whom they first thought were heavily intoxicated, as they seemed to struggle to stand up, before realising that both had serious head injuries and were barely conscious, and the whole area surrounding them was covered in blood. One of the boy scouts approached them, intending to provide first aid, but soon realised that their injuries were far too serious. The boy scouts alerted the ship's front desk, which ordered the ship's on-call nurse and security operative to the site of the incident. The nurse immediately recognised the severity of the injuries, and asked the ship's captain, also in attendance, to request a Finnish Coast Guard rescue helicopter to be dispatched to carry the victims to the Turku University Hospital ahead of the ship's arrival in port later that morning. At 05:48, the victims reached the hospital, where Schelkle was pronounced dead on arrival from massive injuries to the head, despite attempts by the ship's nurse to resuscitate him during the flight. Taxis was in critical condition with similar injuries, apparently resulting from heavy blows to the head. A chief investigator later described the attack as \\"especially ferocious\\". Investigation The crime almost certainly took place within the jurisdiction of the √Öland Islands, but the Ministry of Interior decided that due to the significant investigative resources required, the Turku regional police force would investigate the matter instead, assisted by the National Bureau of Investigation. The first police investigators and crime scene technicians arrived on the ship at 06:30, while still at sea, on the same helicopter that had transported the victims to hospital. When the ship docked in Turku at 08:10, the police had it surrounded, aiming to seal in the perpetrator who was still thought to be aboard. The police initially planned to interview and video-record all passengers as they disembarked, but soon realised this was not possible due to the sheer numbers involved, with passengers on board that day, and decided to exclude families with children and the elderly. They had also detained certain persons of interest including the victims' friend Schmid, as well as the young British man they had associated with, who was found in the morning with his clothes stained in blood, which he claimed was the result of a nose-bleed. Schmid was soon ruled out, but the British man was interviewed repeatedly, until forensic studies confirmed that the blood in his clothing was indeed almost certainly his, although due to the 1980s forensic technology this was not wholly conclusive. In August 1987, shortly after the incident, local fishermen discovered a plastic bag full of clothes on the uninhabited skerry of Lilla Bj√∂rnholm, outside Korpo in the Turku archipelago, only some from the shipping line used by the ferries to and from Turku. They left it there, but when they returned a year later and found the bag still there, they passed it on to the police. The investigators published the bag's contents, including the fact that a glove found in the bag was monogrammed with initials 'H.K.', and stated that some forensic evidence suggested that the clothes originated from Viking Sally, but this did not lead to a break in the case. Over the next several years, as many as possible of the video-recorded passengers were traced and interviewed, although some could never be identified. The investigators sailed on the same ship several times, hoping to find clues, to no avail. As forensic technology advanced, the evidence gathered provided some clues, but ultimately not enough to solve the mystery. There were no eye witnesses to the incident, no useful CCTV footage, no apparent motive, and Ms Taxis has no recollection of the incident, all of which made solving the crime particularly difficult. Despite unprecedented scale of police effort, the investigation was discontinued as fruitless in the 1990s. New developments In 2019, the police revealed that they had a prime suspect for the crime, but would not reveal the suspect's age, sex or nationality, confirming only that the person was alive, and thought to have acted alone. They later added that the perpetrator is thought not to have known the victims. On 11 September 2020, the Turku police department finally announced that they had solved the case, and were passing it on to prosecutors. The authorities have not disclosed the identity of the suspected perpetrator, or released other details of the latest developments in the investigation. They have also declined to explain why the suspect has not been apprehended despite his or her identity being known. If the prosecutors find sufficient evidence to support a murder (and attempted murder) charge, the case will likely go to court. However, if there are grounds only for manslaughter or other lesser homicide charges, the case will almost certainly lapse, due to the Finnish statute of limitations requiring manslaughter charges to be brought within 20 years. If the case does go to court and result in a conviction, it would represent the longest offence-to-conviction lead time in Finnish judicial history.

Announced at E3 2019 as Gods and Monsters, the game is set to be released for Amazon Luna, Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S on December 3, 2020. Gameplay Immortals is an action-adventure video game played from a third-person perspective. At the beginning of the game, players can customise the gender, the voice and the appearances of Fenyx using Aphrodite‚Äôs Beauty Chair. At any point of the game, they can return to the beauty chair and customise Fenyx. The game is set in a large open world, consisting of seven distinct regions inspired by the Greek gods. The player character is accompanied by a companion bird named Phosphor, which can identify locations of interest in the map. Fenyx can traverse the world quickly through climbing cliffs, riding on a mount, and flying using the wings of Daedalus. As players explore the world, they would encounter rifts which would teleport them to the Vaults of Tartaros, which are a series of platforming challenges that require players to utilize both Fenyx's combat and traversal abilities. Players can also complete various side-objectives and optional puzzles. The world of the Golden Isles are occupied with various enemies inspired by Greek mythology, including minotaurs to cyclopes. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks with a sword are fast but weak, and heavy attacks with a hammer are slow but strong. Fenyx can also use bows and arrows to defeat enemies. Players need to manage Fenyx's stamina during combat, as they will become exhausted when they attack successively. As players progress in the game, they would be able to unlock powerful godlike abilities. For instance, Fenyx can unlock Ares' spears which thrust enemies into the air. Armor and weapons can also be upgraded by collecting sufficient crafting resources in the game's world. Story After an accident stranded Greek soldier Fenyx on the Golden Isle, they must rescue the Greek gods from the titan Typhon, who seeks revenge after he was banished by Zeus and the Greek gods to Tartaros. The game features a light-hearted tone, with Prometheus being the game's main narrator and Zeus being the unreliable narrator. Development The game is currently being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the team which created Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Game director Scott Phillips added that the project originated from a software bug the team discovered during the development of Odyssey, which changed the humans on the player's crew into giant cyclopses, and decided that it would be a good idea to create a separate game that embraces the mythological side of Greece. Due to the positive reception of Odyssey, Ubisoft's management agreed to greenlight the project. The game was officially announced as Gods and Monsters during E3 2019. Initially set to be released on February 26, 2020, the game was delayed in October 2019 after another Ubisoft's tentpole release Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint failed to be commercially successful. According to Ubisoft, the delay gave additional time for development team to \\"ensure that their respective innovations are perfectly implemented so as to deliver optimal experiences for players\\". Quebec studio used the additional time to add Zeus and Promethus as the game's duo narrators, replacing Greek poet Homer who was initially intended to fulfill this role. A work-in-progress build of the game was leaked on Stadia under the codename Orpheus in June 2020. It was re-revealed as Immortals Fenyx Rising on September 10, 2020. The studio decided to rename the game to reflect its narrative focus and put more emphasis on Fenyx, the game's protagonist. The name change appeared to be a result from a trademark dispute with Monster Energy, which challenged the Gods and Monsters name believing it would cause confusion. Gareth Coker, who previously worked on Ori and the Blind Forest and its sequel Ori and the Will of the Wisps, would compose the score for the game. Ancient Greek instruments such as lyre and kithara, were used when he was recording the music. Coker commissioned these instruments from a Greek luthier, and had them transported across the Atlantic. The game is set to be released on December 3, 2020 for Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S. A free demo for the game would be released for Stadia users before the game's official launch. Reception Pre-release reception was generally positive, with most of the critics comparing the game to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Upon announcement, the game's new title received mixed reviews.

Upam Buzarbaruah of Times Of India wrote \\"Tiki Taka is a nice watch. It boasts of some decent performances. While Parambrata and Emona rule the screen with their chemistry, Ritabhari also delivers her role quite nicely. The rest of the cast, however, have too short a screen presence for us to judge their performances\\" [The Quint wrote \\" Tiki-Taka is a fast-paced, entertaining watch and also an ode to Kolkata‚Äôs obsession with soccer\\"  References   External links  * * Tiki-Taka on ZEE5 Category:2020s sports comedy-drama films Category:Hindi-language films Category:Bengali-language films Category:2020s Hindi-language films Category:2020s Bengali-language films Category:2020 direct-to-video films Category:2020 drama films Category:2020 films Category:Indian association football films Category:Indian sports comedy-drama films Category:Indian multilingual films Category:ZEE5 original films Category:Films shot in Kolkata Category:Films not released in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"Tiki-Taka (film)"},{"id":"65287487","text":"Aequigidiella is a monotypic genus of amphipod crustaceans.

It features Joseph Young's sculpture Triforium, a colorful sculpture unveiled in 1975, which has with 1,500 blown- glass prisms synchronized to an electronic glass bell carillon. The mall opened in 1974 and includes a four-level parking garage with 2,400 spaces. The mall was designed by architectural firm Stanton & Stockwell which also designed the Los Angeles County Courthouse and Kenneth Hahn L.A. County Hall of Administration. It was conceived as a \\"town square\\" for meetings, retail, public institutions and public art, serving the general public and the tens of thousands of government employees working at the Civic Center's municipal, state and federal buildings. Cornell, Bridgers, Troller and Hazlett were the landscape designers. Plan to demolish The site is largely to be demolished, along with the new ‚ÄúLos Angeles Street Civic Building‚Äù (LASCB) on the site of the demolished Parker Center, part of a larger project to diversify, revitalize and reconnect the district. https://civiccenterprojects.lacity.org/sites/default/files/CCD%20191119%20Community%20Mtg%20%234%20Presentation_sm.pdf Plazas The plazas are primarily paved and lined with city government buildings. In and around the plazas are grass lawns and planters of flowering shrubs, and specimen trees. The South Mall surrounds City Hall East, an 18-story, Brutalist, 1972 building also by Stanton & Stockwell, featuring a mural by Millard Sheets, The Family of Man. Around the edges are a mix of tall deciduous trees. Here is the Howard Troller and Hanns Scharff's 1974 Eleanor Chambers Memorial Fountain (nicknamed Dan-de-lion). Also here are two Chinese lions celebrating the 200th Anniversary of the signing of United States Declaration of Independence. The Sunken Palm Court has paths that arc out; located here is Jan Peter Stern's 1974 stainless steel sculpture Cubed Square. The North Mall's plaza is elevated and enclosed by mature jacaranda trees. This is the location of Triforium. Another plaza, this one sunken, at the base of the former Children‚Äôs Museum includes a food court, stands of palm, and the Robert J. Stevenson Fountain, which is in the form of a pointed obelisk, red and brown in color, placed in a pool with jets of water in a centrifugal form. Tenants Besides City Hall East and the Children's Museum, tenants in 1981 included 15 shops including Sav-on Drug Stores, 9 services including Security Pacific National Bank, and 9 food outlets including Bob's Jr. by Bob's Big Boy and a Carls Jr.. Decline By the mid-1980s, the mall was already considered, due to lack of maintenance, an \\"embarrassment\\" and there was discussion whether the Children's Museum should take over the entire mall. The Children's Museum moved to another location around 2000. Many people experiencing homelessness make use of the space and plans from 2018 included one to convert the space to housing for those currently homeless.In the late 2010s the homeless population increased in the area, causing a decrease in the use of public areas by the general population.

History  Created on March 28, 2016 after the adoption of the Federal Law No. 297-FZ dated 03.11.2015 \\"On the jurisdictional immunities of a foreign state and property of a foreign state in the Russian Federation\\", which changed the jurisdictional immunity of foreign states in Russia. The Fund specializes in resolving disputes in Russian and international courts. Since February 2018, the Fund has been a member of the interdepartmental working group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs created to develop recommendations for ensuring effective legal protection of Russian citizens abroad.  Important cases  = Bank Snoras: lawsuit against the Republic of Lithuania = On November 16, 2011 the government of Lithuania adopted the Resolution No. 1329 ‚ÄúOn withdrawal of Bank Snoras shares for public needs‚Äù with the payment of compensation to shareholders. The compensation hasn‚Äôt been paid to this day. On November 24, 2011 Bank of Lithuania revoked the license of Bank Snoras following the report of the interim manager Simon Freakley. In August, 2016 the former majority shareholder of Bank Snoras, with the support of the Fund, filed a lawsuit in Moscow Arbitration Court against the Republic of Lithuania to recover property damage (material damage) in the amount of 20,209,353,110 rubles, to compensate for the damage to the business reputation in the amount of 19,904,862,500 rubles and to declare false the information that had been disseminated by the President of the Republic of Lithuania and further reposted by the online media. Lithuania has used the right of state immunity from the jurisdiction of Russian courts. In 2019 the Fund filed a lawsuit for the illegal nationalization of Bank Snoras in the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The preliminary amount of the claim is 1.1 billion euros. Also the Fund's human rights defenders applied to the New York court to oblige Simon Freakley (the interim bank manager for the period of nationalization) and his new company AlixPartners to provide documents confirming the shortage in the capital of Bank Snoras and justifying the nationalization and expropriation. Lithuania tried to challenge this appeal, but it was declined in court. The media called this decision the Fund's first victory in the case. = Lawsuit against National bank TRUST = On April 15, 2020 the Fund for the Protection of Investors‚Äô Rights in Foreign Countries filed a lawsuit with the High Court of Justice (London, UK) against Trust Bank and its former owners and top managers Ilya Yurov, Sergey Belyaev and Nikolay Fetisov, as well as their wives. The preliminary amount of the claim is 300 million pounds. The Fund represents the interests of a group of investors (former clients of Trust Bank) who invested in credit-linked notes distributed by the bank to its major depositors. Due to illegal and unfair actions of the former owners of Trust Bank, deceived investors lost all their funds put in credit-linked notes, since the credit-linked notes were canceled as a result of the actions of Ilya Yurov, Nikolai Fetisov and Sergei Belyaev. The application to the High Court of Justice and the right of this court to consider the claim is based on the fact that Mr. Yurov and Mr. Fetisov, as well as their spouses, currently live in England. According to British lawyers, the case can be considered within a year, since the High Court of Justice has recently ruled against Yurov, Belyaev and Fetisov on the lawsuit of National Bank TRUST, which resolved a large number of issues also related to the case of the Fund. The court decided that all three bankers were involved in the fraudulent scheme and bear responsibility for the bank collapse in December, 2014.

Childhood and education Alice Koller was born in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio on September 13, 1925. Her father Andrew R. Koller was a plumbing salesman who later owned a plumbing supply store in Akron, Ohio, where she grew up. Her mother Sarah L. Koller was a housewife. She had an older brother, Kenneth, and a younger sister, Muriel. After graduating as her class Valedictorian from Buchtel High School in 1943, she worked for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for a year, then moved to Chicago to attend drama classes at the Goodman Theatre school of drama. While there, she won a national contest for \\"the best radio voice\\" held by the radio show People Are Funny. She left the Goodman school after two years and enrolled at the University of Chicago, but left without graduating. She was selected as a student guest editor at Mademoiselle in the summer of 1948 (a position held five years later by Sylvia Plath). Koller earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Akron in 1952. She then attended Radcliffe College as a graduate student, gaining her doctorate in philosophy from Harvard in 1960. Her dissertation was titled, \\"The Concept of Emotion: A Study of the Analyses of James, Russell, and Ryle.\\" Her family could not afford to provide much financial support, so Koller depended upon scholarships, fellowships, and part-time jobs, working by her own count over thirty jobs in the space of 15 years. While attending Harvard, she was awarded a patent for a unique way of constructing sleeves for garments. Work Koller struggled unsuccessfully to land a permanent position after graduating from Harvard, taking a series of short-term jobs instead: \\"Four months in New York, three in Cambridge as though I hadn't fled it. Two months in Berkeley, four in Santa Barbara. Boston. New York again.\\" Finally, in the winter of 1962, she rented a house in Siasconset, on the eastern end of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts and spent three months there in almost complete isolation aside from a German shepherd puppy she named Logos. She hoped that the time would \\"let me understand who I am and what I want.\\" \\"Being a philosopher,\\" she later said, \\"I knew how to think and to know what counted as tough questions. I knew not to accept anything less than tough answers and kept pressing and pressing and pressing myself.\\" She turned her journal of this stay into a book she titled \\"A Map for an Inward Journey.\\" It would later be published as An Unknown Woman. While on Nantucket, she was hired by Dr. Harold Wooster, chief of the information sciences division of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research to prepare an analysis of the linguistic challenges involved in machine translation. This report became her first book, A Hornbook of Hazards for Linguists, published in 1967. She was offered a teaching position at Connecticut College following her Air Force contract, but chose to finish her memoir instead. Permanent posts continued to elude her. She taught or worked as a consultant for the University of Waterloo, Cornell University, Harvard University, the National Institutes of Health, and as a speechwriter for a congressman. When Washington Star reporter Judy Flander interviewed Koller in 1977, however, she was unemployed and living on food stamps near Warrenton, Virginia. She also owed legal fees from a suit she had filed against a Silver Spring, Maryland veterinary clinic over the 1974 death of Logos, the dog who'd accompanied Koller on her stay on Nantucket. It took fourteen years and rejections from thirty different publishers before Holt, Rinehart & Winston accepted the book in 1981. It proved an unexpected bestseller, going into several printings. The Kirkus Reviews reviewer predicted that Koller's \\"groping for certainty within loneliness, depression, and fear may strike a chord in many,\\" and the book continued to be widely read for years after going out of print. Following its publication, Koller was hired by the New York Times to write a short series of articles titled \\"Hers\\" that appeared in late 1983. She lived off the royalties from An Unknown Woman for several years, then returned to a life of short-term consulting and teaching jobs. In 1990, she published The Stations of Solitude, which drew upon the model of the Stations of the Cross and outlined thirteen stations with themes such as \\"Unbinding,\\" \\"Working,\\" and \\"Standing Open.\\" She saw the book as \\"a line of travel,\\" through \\"the process of shaping a human being, and the stations are stopping places in the process.\\" Like An Unknown Woman, however, the book was heavily autobiographical and went over many of the same experiences discussed in the earlier book. The resulting reviews were less enthusiastic: \\"Koller seems to be writing for herself, failing to invite readers into her exclusive domain of solitude,\\" wrote Francisca Goldsmith in Library Journal. In an essay included in Herspace: Women, Writing, and Solitude, however, Christina Pugh applauded Koller for both the courage of her writings and \\"the immense cultural need for such an exemplar.\\" Koller lived in New England for most of the decades following The Stations of Solitude and continued to take on occasional speaking and writing jobs. In 2008 at the age of 83, she established a website (now defunct) where she solicited patrons to help fund a work in progress titled ‚ÄúMeditation on Being a Philosopher.‚Äù She moved to New Jersey several years before her death and died at a Trenton, New Jersey hospital in 2020.

The film is about R&AW; agents in London investigating China's role in the pandemic with a ruthless mole in their midst. Plot R&AW; officials stationed in London have gathered strong evidence through their sources which indicate the involvement of Chinese Communist party in the spread of the virus and are very close to getting the final evidence. However, Chinese authorities get wind of this through a mole in the Indian embassy. In order to have a low-key presence the R&AW; uses a grocery store as their outpost to execute and coordinate operations.

She married her longtime boyfriend. However, multiple undercover and foreign operations led to less communication between them which added bitterness to their relationship. By the time she became the station chief, she found ways to manage her personal and professional life, and her pregnancy was an outcome of that. Scars of failed missions in Istanbul and Berlin have tempered her emotions. Since then she has been working in the cover of being employed at the Indian embassy for the past 10 years.

Written by Akshay Singh and Prateek Payodhi and directed by Kanwal Sethi, London Confidential doesn‚Äôt indulge in much Chinese-bashing.

The grammistins have secondary structures and biological effects comparable to other classes of peptide toxins, melittin from the bee stings and pardaxins which are secreted in the skin of two sole species. A similar toxin has been found to be secreted in the skin of some clingfishes. Grammistins have a distinctive bitter taste. Soapfishes increase the amount of toxin released in their skin if they are stressed and other species of fish kept in a confined space with a stressed soapfish normally die. If ingested at a high enough dosage the toxin is lethal to mammals with some symptoms being similar to those produce by ciguatoxins. Grammistins also cause hemolysis of mammalian blood cells. The main purpose of the secretion of grammastin is defensive and when a lionfish (Pterois miles) tries to predate on a soapfish it immediately ejects it from its mouth, suggesting that it had detected the bitter taste.

In the book, Darke details the influences of Middle Eastern architecture on European architecture. Content Darke, who graduated in German and Arabic from Oxford University, did not pursue a career in academia but rather worked as a journalist in Damascus, Syria until the start of the civil war. In April 2019, after the Notre-Dame de Paris fire, she was inspired to write the book after pointing out her belief that Notre-Dame and all other Gothic architecture is based on a church in Qalb Loze, Syria, built by the Christian Byzantine Empire in the 5th century. The book tracks the Gothic features of the pointed arch to the Dome of the Rock in 7th-century Jerusalem and the ribbed vault to the Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba in 10th-century Al-Andalus. The windows of the Saint Denis basilica are described as being traceable from the Muslim world via adoption in the wealthy Italian port of Amalfi, then Monte Cassino Abbey and Cluny Abbey. In Venice, another Italian port that traded with the East, the influence went beyond architecture, with local women wearing garments similar to a niqab. Sir Christopher Wren, best known for St Paul's Cathedral in London, is cited for his statement that Gothic architecture should be called Saracen architecture. The book's title is a play on the theory that the medieval European exonym for Muslims, Saracen, came from the Arabic saraqa meaning \\"to steal\\". Reception Prior to its release, the book was the subject of an article in The Guardian by architecture correspondent Oliver Wainwright, titled \\"Looted landmarks: how Notre-Dame, Big Ben and St Mark's were stolen from the east\\". Subsequent reviews mentioned this article and how its title built interest in the book through controversy, but also called it oversimplified and unrepresentative of the book's contents. A review in Germany's Der Tagesspiegel noted that the book coincided with the international controversy over Istanbul's Hagia Sophia, a former church and museum that had been reconverted into a mosque. Contrary to Wainwright's headline, Darke instead argues that culture is interconnected and architecture does not belong to a single culture. In the book, she mentions how the Muslims themselves adapted some elements from the Greek and Roman remains in the Middle East. Darke's citation of Wren has been described as out of context by some reviewers. Vaughan Hart, a Professor of Architecture at the University of Bath and author of a book on Wren's Eastern influences, wrote that \\"Wren had self-interested reasons for making this claim, and knew very little about Arab buildings\\". In the Asian Review of Books, Peter Gordon wrote that Wren's statement on Gothic architecture was actually one of contempt, though the double dome he used on St Paul's is of Middle Eastern origin. Aaron Betsky, director of the School of Architecture + Design at the Virginia Tech College of Architecture and Urban Studies, criticised the hypothesis that Filippo Brunelleschi based the design of the Duomo of Florence from Arab texts. Hart wrote that Darke's comparison between Big Ben and a now destroyed minaret of the Great Mosque of Aleppo has no evidence of direct influence and could distract from her argument. Architecture critic Rowan Moore of The Observer named this as an example of some unconvincing arguments in the book. Gordon argued that starting the book with the church of Qalb Loze is inaccurate as the building is Christian and predates Islam, while mosaics, coloured glass and bell towers were in Europe before that religion began.

Painted in circa 1871, the painting once belonged to Robert de Montesquiou, and is currently housed at the Princeton University Art Museum located in Princeton, New Jersey. The Psych√© is noted for its realism, witticism, and allegory, three dimensions generally perceived sequentially herein. The French word psych√© (meaning, as in English, both \\"the mind\\" and the ancient goddess beloved of Cupid) also designates a full-length mirror, invented in the late eighteenth century, that can be moved up and down or tilted on its chassis. Here, however, the psych√© is placed on an easel, where a canvas is supposed to sit. The young woman, like Psyche to Cupid in the ancient tale, peers stealthily around the edge of the mirror to the viewer. In this painting, Psyche looks both into the mirror and, via the latter, at the viewer. Background and description Detail of parrot, cigarette butt, ash, and extinguished match Trained in Brussels, Stevens finished his studies in Paris and made his career there. During the Second Empire (1852‚Äì70), he pioneered and perfected the domestic interior scene, which the Impressionists then adopted. He was deeply influenced by Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch and often painted on wood panel. This painting, which once belonged to the poet Robert de Montesquiou, is one of several by Stevens of his studio with a model and sometimes the artist. The painting's title alludes to multiple things, most notably the myth of Psyche and Cupid and the type of large mirror depicted on the left. A full-length mirror with chassis was invented in the late eighteenth century and took its name, psych√©, from the aforementioned legend of Cupid and Psyche, a story that thematizes looking. Yet this is not an actual psych√© but an easel with a mirror where the canvas would normally sit, an analogue to a psych√© suggesting that art is a reflection of life. A cloth partially covers the mirror, hiding the reflections of the studio. Focus instead is on the model, who may have interrupted her posing session to peer around the edge of the mirror, which reflects her head and hand. The artist hints at his own presence with the cigarette butt, ash, and match in the lower right corner. Nearby struts a small parrot, a reference to art's mimetic function. The backs of canvases and portfolios of prints or drawings represent some of Stevens's working materials. On a chair are Japanese prints, reminders of the artist's great passion: with his friends the Goncourt Brothers, Bracquemond, and Whistler, Stevens was one of the earliest collectors of Japanese art in Paris. Among the small paintings on the wall is a sketch for his Salon picture What They Call Vagrancy (1854; Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay), a picture of social protest. Signature In the years between 1850 and 1870, Stevens was pre-eminently regarded as a painter of the Parisian establishment . He made a name for himself as the upper class' ladies painter and painted in a highly realistic style, deeply influenced by the Dutch fine painters and Old Masters, particularly Johannes Vermeer. However, his works are distinguished by his emphasis on the casual, transitory moment, anticipating Impressionism. On the other hand, the emerging Impressionism began to influence Stevens around 1870, which manifested itself in a looser brushwork. La Psych√© is one of the first works by Stevens in which these two aspects coincide. Theme and interpetation La Psych√© shows a young model in Stevens' Parisian studio during a break. She is half hidden behind a mirror, through which she looks at the viewer directly in the eye. Such a large mirror, wherein one can see oneself fully, is a piece of furniture typical of the second half of the nineteenth century and, as mentioned, it was also called psych√©.Opvallend is dat de standaard niet draaibaar is, als gebruikelijk bij een Psych√©. Vermoedelijk heeft Stevens hier zijn schildersezel afgebeeld als een spiegel. Een Psych√© was ook zeker geen gemeengoed was in een schildersatelier. The title of the painting, however, also refers through the furtive glance of the young woman to the myth of Psyche, who was forbidden to look at her beloved Amor, but secretly could not resist. In the painting, in a witty transposition, Stevens‚Äô model takes a break from posing and peeks around the psych√© that stands in for the canvas on an easel. The artist's presence is implied by his cigarette butt, ash, and extinguished match on the floor (Stevens was a heavy smoker). There is a parrot, which signifies the act of imitation‚Äîjust as the bird mimics human speech, so the artist imitates (or \\"mirrors\\") life. The Japanese prints in a portfolio reveal the artist's interest in Asian art. Stevens was an early collector, and he advocated Japonisme, which became increasingly available after a treaty opened Japan to international trade in 1854. Like Rembrant, Stevens was renowned for his ability in portraying exotic objects.Cf. Alfred Stevens, blz. 145. Montesquiou The Parisian dandy Robert de Montesquiou, who was the main inspiration for Baron de Charlus in Proust's √Ä la recherche du temps perdu, was one of the early owners of La psych√©.Het schilderij hing in zijn eetkamer, Alfred Stevens, blz. 57. Of the work he wrote that it is \\"as if an apotheosis of Stevens' art and of his loves: the women, the objects and the reflections they multiply\\". As mentioned, on a chair there are the Japanese prints that the artist was so fond of.Stevens ging als geen ander mee met het toentertijd sterk in mode zijnde Japonisme. Montesquiou, however, was especially fascinated by the trinkets and other exotica that better suited him and his own lifestyle. He summarized the rubbish in the studio as d'une v√©rit√© bien hollandaise (of a truly Dutch reality). In a laudatory article, he pointed to the similarity between Vermeer and Stevens, especially the way in which both could paint to the finest detail not familiar, but rather exotic gems and objects: rubies, turquoise, and even the wonderfully colored wings of an exotic butterfly.

He was the first commander of the Force Publique, the armed force used to police the colony. __TOC__ Force Publique troops Early years (1858‚Äì1886) L√©on Roget was born in Brussels on 21 June 1858. His parents were Th√©odore Roget and Antoinette Meganck. He joined the army on 28 September 1873. He entered the Military School on 4 April 1876, and graduated with the rank of infantry second lieutenant on 4 June 1878. After serving for several years he entered the War School, where he studied for three years and graduated as adjoint d'√©tat-major on 8 December 1885. Soon after he was promoted to staff captain. First Congo term (1886‚Äì1888) Roget was admitted to the service of the Congo Free State on 15 April 1886, and left for Africa on 28 June 1886. On 17 August 1886 he was appointed the first commander of the Force Publique. During his first term of service Roget stayed in Boma and devoted all his energy to creating and organizing the Force Publique, and to creating an artillery battery in Boma. Willem Frans Van Kerckhoven sent a first contingent of recruits for the Force Publique from the Bangalas. Camille Van den Plas led the first contingent of 84 Bangala soldiers, with 11 women, to Boma. Van den Plas was made responsible for training the Bangalas recruits under the orders of Roget. Henri Avaert reached Banana on 13 March 1886 and was assigned to Vivi. Soon after he was sent to Boma and was made deputy to Roget to help organize the first Bangalas contingent of the Force Publique. The number of troops grew quickly, and they proved capable of maintaining order, escorting supply caravans and supporting expeditions of exploration. By the time Roget returned for his second term of service there were 600 trained soldiers. They included volunteers and forced recruits from annual levies. They were organized into eight companies, distributed among the districts, with three training centers charged with supplying men to the companies. Roget left for leave in Belgium on 21 October 1888. Second Congo term (1889‚Äì1890) King Leopold II wanted to prevent the constant incursions of Arab slave traders, and decided to create an entrenched camp on the Aruwimi River and another on the Lomami River. Jules Alexandre Milz arrived in Boma on 25 July 1888 as an officer of the Force Publique and was assigned to the Bangala District, where Van Kerckhoven was preparing an expedition to establish entrenched camps on the Aruwimi River and Sankuru River for defense against Arab slavers. Milz left Bangala on 24 October 1888 with the column led by Francis Dhanis. The column founded posts at Umangi, Upoto and Yambuya. On 8 February 1889 the column was at the confluence of the Aruwimi with the Congo River, where the Basoko station was established, capital of the new Aruwimi-Uele District. The expedition then founded the posts of Bomane, Bassoa and Yambisi. Roget was appointed district commissioner 1st class on 23 March 1889. He left for the Congo on 11 April 1889 and reached Boma on 15 May 1889. Roget was charged with building the camp at Basoko. It was intended to block further westward movement by the Arabs, and to serve as a base for offensive action against them. Roget took command there on 28 July 1889. Roget created a model entrenched camp at Basoko. Strong defenses were developed quickly, including batteries of artillery. However, from this base Roget could not prevent the Arabs from circulating through the vast territory of the eastern Congo Basin. He was instructed to used Arab guides to travel to the north of the Uele, and to establish friendly relations with the sultans of that region to prevent them from allying with the Zanzibari Arabs. In April 1890 Milz and Joseph Duvivier accompanied Roget to found a post in Djabir (Bondo) on the Uele. They established the Ibembo station on the Itimbiri River, where they left Duvivier in command. Milz went on with Roget to the Go rapids, then overland to the Likati River where they founded the Ekwangatana post. They entrusted this post to an African officer. They returned to Ibembo, then went NNE towards the upper Likati and Djabir, crossing the Tinda River basin. They founded Mopocho between Ibembo and the Likati on 23 May 1890, which they also entrusted to an African officer. On 25 May 1890 they crossed the Likati and on 27 May 1890 reached the Uele River opposite Sultan Djabir's village. Sultan Djabir signed a treaty with Milz and a post was established on the site of the former Egyptian zeriba of Deleb. Milz began construction of the station while Roget, guided by Sultan Djabir, tried unsuccessfully to join Alphonse van G√®le in Yakoma. Roget had gone north as far as Mbili and Gangu, having heard that the country downstream was too dangerous. On 9 June 1890 he returned to Djabir. Roget left Djabir in July to return to Basoko, leaving Milz in command with instructions to attempt the liaison with Yakoma. He returned to Basoko suffering from bouts of haematuric fever, and was ordered by the doctor to return to the coast. He embarked at Boma on 25 October 1890 and reached Belgium on 12 December 1890. Later career (1890‚Äì1909) Roget returned to the army, and taught at the War School. He was then appointed to represent Belgian interests in the Compagnie √† charte du Mozambique. He was made managing director of this company in Lisbon, made two visits to the company's territories as inspector general of the company, then took over the general direction in Lisbon. He returned to Africa between December 1905 and August 1906 as administrator of the Compagnie des Magasins G√©n√©raux du Congo to inspect and organize the company's establishments. He was also appointed an administrator of the Compagnie pour le Commerce et l'Industrie. He was the first secretary general of the Belgian Society for Colonial Studies. In 1908 he went to Katanga via Cape Town and Rhodesia for the Compagnie Intertropicale. A contracted a respiratory disease on this trip from which he died in Brussels on 4 February 1909.

He was involved in the organization of spy networks in the Ottoman Empire in support of the Catholic powers of southern Europe and he participated in several plans for large-scale revolts against the Ottomans.  Early life  Giovanni Renesi was born around 1567 in the town of Zara (modern Zadar). He came from an Albanian Catholic family, which belonged to the Renesi fis of Lezha in northern Albania. They had settled in Zara as refugees after the Ottoman conquest of Albania and joined the stradioti regiments of Venice like many other Albanian refugees in Dalmatia. His family had produced many military captains, administrators and governors in the Stato da M√†r. His father and his brother were both military commanders of the Venetian Republic. Renesi served the Venetian Republic as a stradiot until 1607, when he was banished from the Venetian Republic for murder in a blood feud. Following these events, Renesi would regularly inform the Venetians of his future activities, which he probably did in the hope that they would lift the ban pending on him. A Venetian report in 1617-18 describes him as man of pale skin colour who had a lean body, a black beard and who dressed in \\"French style\\" (alla francese).  Rebellion and espionage  At the beginning of 1607, Renesi was in Turin and met with Carlo Emanuele I of Savoy. He proposed to the duke to take part in a rebellion against the Ottoman Turks, which was promoted by the voivode Grdan of Nik≈°iƒá and the patriarch Jovan II of Peƒá. Near the end of 1607 and beginning of 1608, Renesi participated in a mission in Mljet, led by Carlo Emanuele who sent out spies to the island and to Ragusa with the intention of supporting rebel leaders who had gathered in order to oppose Ottoman rule. Renesi had as role to negotiate directly with the leaders of the possible uprising rebels. At the end of the summer of 1608, Renesi arrived in Dalmatia with the envoys of Carlo Emanuele, and informed Grdan about the duke's decision in relation to their previously planned rebellion. Carlo Emmanuele assured his support for the uprising for the months of January or February 1609, depending on the weather conditions. However, the intervention announced by Carlo Manuele for January-February 1609 did not take place and the duke lost all interest in the Balkans. Renesi together with the other representatives of the uprising villages, were forced to seek support from another prince, the Duke of Mantua, Vincenzo I Gonzaga. Renesi arrived in Mantua at the end of 1609, accompanied by a Dutch merchant and two noblemen from Ragusa. They presented the plan to the duke and informed him that Maurice of Nassau was also desiring to participate in it. The talks with the Duke of Mentua prevailed until his death on February 18, 1612. Later in the same year, Renesi went to Milan to propose to another governor, Marquis de la Hinojosa, the undertaking of the uprising in Montenegro and Albania. Renesi tried to convince the duke by offering him, in case of victory, two of the most important strongholds in the region. Hinojosa encouraged Renesi to go to the court of Madrid as ambassador of the Albanians and the Serbs. Renesi sent a letter to the bishop of Vigevano Lombardy who relayed it to the Spanish court in Madrid where Renesi asked for military support for the uprising. In 1614, Renesi was in Parma, to propose the Duke Ranuccio I Farnese to assume leadership of the rebellion. Farnese sent him in the Balkans with money. On July 14 during the Convention of Ku√ßi, Renesi informed the local leaders of the Duke of Parma's support for their plans and they accepted to recognize Farnese as their lord. These plans were abandoned when he returned to Italy as internal European conflicts stopped any plans for a future campaign against the Ottoman Empire. On August 1615, the pretender to the Ottoman throne, Sultan Yahya, and the Duke of Nevres met in Paris. Renesi was also present and Sultan Yahya gave him a decree of appointment addressed to the archbishops, nobles and leaders of the Balkans. In the decree Renesi was presented as Sultan Yahya‚Äôs ambassador and was authorized to negotiate in his name. The Duke of Nevres gave Renesi a passport which allowed him to travel freely. Renesi left Paris on April 1616, with orders to meet with the Dukes of Tuscany and Mantua before going to the Balkans. In 1617, on Farnese‚Äôs request, Renesi went to Madrid. Farnese ordered his ambassador to Spain, Flavio Atti, to meet with the Duke of Lerma, the secretary Antonio de Ar√≥stegui, the Marquis of Hinojosa and with the confessor of King Filipe II. During the meeting, Renesi told Hinjora that there were many provinces involved in the uprising and he explained to him that they were inhabited by Albanians and Slavs, and not by Greeks. Hinojosa offered to undertake the uprising in a union with Rome and Venice. Renesi argued that the undertaking of the rebellion would involve the initial costs of two armies and 12,000 soldiers. The negotiations at the Spanish court lasted until the end of October 1617, but no results were achieved.

Mahapatra was a court musician of Gajapati Mukundadeba. It is the second earliest music treatise discovered from Odisha. The treatise was first published by the Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi in 1983, based on two palm leaf manuscripts preserved in the Odisha State Museum, Bhubaneswar. Both manuscripts were collected from Puri district, Odisha and were roughly dated to the 18th century.  Author  Krusnadesa Badajena Mahapatra was a 16th-century musician par excellence from Odisha. The author reveals no information about his family, age or any other details in his text. However, the period to which he belonged can be determined by internal evidence. A song authored by Raya Ramananda on Gajapati Prataparudra Deba has been quoted in the Gitaprakasa. Another musicologist Haladhara Misra refers to Krusnadasa's Gitaprakasa in his treatise called Sangitakalpalatika, composed between 1623 and 1647 AD. Since Mahapatra himself eulogises Gajapati Mukundadeba, it is inferred that he was a contemporary of the king and most probably served as a court musician. There has only been one Gajapati in the history of Odisha bearing the name Mukunda. He was the last independent ruler of Odisha from 1559 to 1568 AD. Hence, Krusnadasa can be dated to the same period. In the year 1565, Mahapatra presented his music in the court of Akbar. Abul Fazl extolls a certain 'Mahapattar' in his Ain-i- Akbari. The Akbarnama also makes mention of a \\"Mahapattar who adorned the court of Akbar, the great Mogul and who was unrivalled in the arts of Indian poetry and music\\". The surname Mahapatra is one of the most popular surnames of Odisha, found since the Ganga period. In several inscriptions from the 12th century AD this surname is mentioned. Badajena was another such title in vogue in Odisha. Both titles are popular and found even now. It is certain that the Mahapattar Abul Fazl mentions can be none other than Krusnadasa.  Contents  The Gitaprakasa only deals with aspects of vocal music. The treatise is meticulous in its analysis of songs and their classification. The text is also replete with many examples, a significant portion of them having been composed by the author himself. Like most Odia authors, Mahapatra begins his treatise with a customary invocation to Jagannatha, the venerable deity of Odisha. He cites certain musicologists preceding him, like Harinayaka, author of Sangitasara. The ragas mentioned in the Gitaprakasa are Sri, Natta, KarnƒÅta, Rebagupta, Basanta, Suddhabhairaba, BangƒÅla, Soma, ƒÄmrapanchama, KƒÅmoda, Megha, DrƒÅbidagauda, BarƒÅdi, Gujjari, Todi, MƒÅlabasri, Saindhabi, Debakiri, RƒÅmakiri, Prathamamanjari, NattƒÅ, BelƒÅbali, Gaudi, Gauda, KarnnƒÅtabangƒÅla, Desi, DhannƒÅsi, KolƒÅhala, BallƒÅli, DesƒÅkhya, SƒÅbari, KhambhƒÅbati, Harsapuri, MallƒÅri, HunchhikƒÅ, MadhyamƒÅdi, MallƒÅra, DesapƒÅla, MƒÅlaba, Hindola, Bhairaba, NƒÅgadhwani, Gondakiri, LalitƒÅ, ChhƒÅyƒÅtodi, PratƒÅpabelƒÅbali, Guptabasanta, Paurabi, NattamallƒÅrika, MƒÅravi, Ballabi, Gauri, KalyƒÅni, KarnƒÅtika, ƒÄsƒÅbari and MukhƒÅbari.

He was one of Hideyoshi‚Äôs Ohanashi-sh≈´ (advisers) and accompanied Hideyoshi and Sen Riky≈´ to Arima Onsen where he attended Riky≈´‚Äôs tea gathering. Noriyori was a well-regarded tea master in his own right and he appears in records of Riky≈´‚Äôs tea gatherings. Hideyoshi frequented Noriyori‚Äôs tea gatherings and gave him famous teas wares (meibutsu) such as the Tsukumo Nasu chaire (tea caddy). The chaire was badly damaged in the Honn≈ç-ji Incident but repaired and presented to Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi lost interest in the piece as its once brilliant glaze was charred in the fire. Hideyoshi decided to give Tsukumo to Noriyori. This is still a significant gesture as the chaire was formerly an esteemed piece in the Ashikaga Sh≈çgun‚Äôs collection. Noriyori sided with the East Army in the Battle of Sekigahara for his military exploits during the battle, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded Noriyori the Sanda fief in Settsu Province along with the Beniya Katatsuki chaire (tea caddy). Noriyori died at the age of 70 in Sanda on July 28, 1603 and was buried at Tensho-ji Temple, Ogo.

Launched in 1963 and commissioned into the Southern Fleet in 1964, Bayandor was transferred to Iran by the United States under the Mutual Assistance Program. Construction and commissioning Bayandor was built by the American shipyard Levingston Shipbuilding Company at Orange, Texas. She was laid down on 20 August 1962 and launched on 7 July 1963 on Sabine River, being completed on 15 May 1964. Her commissioning took place three days later on 18 May 1964. Service history In September 1964, Bayandor docked at Brooklyn Navy Yard for a three-day visit to New York City. On 12 January 1968, Bayandor was dispatched to Greater Tunb, in response to British-encouraged flying of the Ras Al Khaimah flag at the island. While she was anchored about one mile east of the Tunbs, a Shackleton of the Royal Air Force spotted her. The British aircraft approached close to Bayandor, and subsequently was aimed by the ships' guns. Following the event, the British mission at Trucial States became prepared to deploy the Trucial Oman Scouts, however Bayandor was not in the area by 13 January. Bayandor and her sister ship arrived at The Ship Repair Facility in Guam on 10 April 1970 for an overhaul that took six months and costed Iran $1‚Äì1.5m. In the way home, the two made port calls to Subie Bay, Singapore, Colombo, Sri Lanka and Cochin, India. An alleged dump of 50,000 gallons of fuel in the sea by the ships prior to the repair stirred a local controversy. The two undergone another major repair in the same base in 1978. During Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì1988), her home port was in Bushehr Naval Base along with her three sister ships. On 13 October 1996, American cruiser bumped into Bayandor in north of Persian Gulf, however neither of the ships suffered from a serious damage. In the 11th deployment of Iran since 2009, Bayandor left home on 29 December 2010 for the Gulf of Aden, returning on 29 January 2011 after 31 days. Starting in 2011, she undergone a major refit that was completed on 11 June 2013, during which a new 76mm Fajr-27 gun and Noor AShM launchers were installed. She was also fitted with a new fire control system, while its engines, heat exchangers, and fuel and oil systems had been overhauled. According to Anthony H. Cordesman, \\"weapons control, search/track radars, and sonars have not been fully modernized since the mid-1960s, although some aspects of the electronic warfare capabilities, communications, and battle management systems in the Bayandor seem to have been upgraded\\". After the refit and trials, she was teamed up with the replenishment ship as the 31st naval group, for an anti-piracy operation also as far afield as Bab-el-Mandeb. The deployment took 120 days, lasting from 16 July to 13 November 2014. The two ships saved six merchant vessels from Somali pirates, including a Chinese container ship on 14 September 2014. On 20 January 2016, the 38th naval group comprising Bayandor, the replenishment ship and the landing ship , left home for a multi-purpose anti-piracy, flag, intelligence collection and training mission that included crossing the Bab-el-Mandeb for a voyage to the Red Sea, as well as crossing equator for a port call to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on 1 March 2016. The ships navigated in total and returned on 2 April 2016 after 73 days of sailing. Along with her sister Naghdi and the amphibious ship of the 50th naval group, she decked at Colombo, Sri Lanka and Mumbai, India during another multi-purpose anti-piracy, flag and training mission. The deployment started on 30 January 2018 and ended on 17 March 2018. As part of the 60th naval group with Lavan and Bushehr, between 20 January and 16 March 2019 she sailed in the Arabian Sea for anti-piracy operations and then made another visit to Colombo. The three vessels also anchored at Muscat, Oman during the mission. In late February 2019, she participated in Velayat 97 wargame as an intelligence collector vessel. Bayandor made security patrols in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden and between May and July 2019, navigating some in the same formation of vessels, this time as the 62nd group. Supported by the fleet replenishment oiler , she departed home on 30 January 2020 in a voyage to cross the Strait of Malacca. The two ships of the 66th naval group anchored at Port of Tanjung Priok between 25 and 28 February to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Indonesia‚ÄìIran relations.

However the drawing seems to have been made from memory: St Anne's Limehouse (top left) is back to front. with the London Hospital to the left Whitechapel Mount was a large artificial mound of disputed origin. A prominent landmark in 18th century London, it stood in the Whitechapel Road beside the newly constructed London Hospital, being not only older, but significantly taller. It was crossed by tracks, served as a scenic viewing-point (and a hiding place for stolen goods), could be ascended by horses and carts, and supported some trees and formal dwelling-houses. It has been interpreted as: a defensive fortification in the English Civil War; a burial place for victims of the Great Plague; rubble from the Great Fire of London; and as a laystall (hence it was sometimes called Whitechapel Dunghill). Possibly all of these theories are true to some extent. Whitechapel Mount was physically removed around 1807. Because Londoners widely believed in the \\"Great Fire rubble\\" theory, the remains were sifted by antique hunters, and some sensational finds were claimed. It survives in its present-day placename Mount Terrace, E1. Location =Neighbourhood= The newly built London Hospital in 1753, showing part of Whitechapel Mount to the west with trees and a house Whitechapel Mount was on the south side of the Whitechapel Road, on the ancient route from the City of London to Mile End, Stratford, Colchester and Harwich. In the 18th century and later the surroundings were mostly fields: grazing for cows or market gardens. Leaving London, a traveller would pass the church of St Mary Matfelon (origin of the name \\"white chapel\\") on the right, then a windmill, before arriving at the Mount. Across the Whitechapel Road was a burying ground and the Ducking Pond. Further east, at the turnpike, the name changed to Mile End Road, with Dog Row (today Cambridge Heath Road) branching off to Bethnal Green. According to John Strype (1720) the neighbourhood was a busy one, with good inns for travellers in Whitechapel and good houses for sea captains in Mile End. Even so, said Strype, the Whitechapel Road was \\"pestered\\" by illegally built, poor quality dwellings. Another source said it was infested by highwaymen, footpads and riff-raff of all kinds who preyed on travellers to and from London. News and court reports speak of murders and robberies. In two Old Bailey cases stolen property was buried in, and recovered from, Whitechapel Mount. It was a place of resort for pugilists and dog-fighters. From the summit of Whitechapel Mount an extensive view of the hamlets of Limehouse, Shadwell, and Ratcliff could be obtained. =On maps= File:Christopher Wren's survey of Westheath, 1673.png1673 Christopher Wren File:Gascoyne 1703 - Whitechapel Mount.jpg1703 Joel Gascoyne File:Strype, map of Whitechapel, 1720.jpg1720 John Strype File:A fragment of Roque's map (1746) showing the location of Whitechapel Mount.png1746 John Rocque File:Blome map, 1775, showing location of Whitechapel Mount.png1755 Richard Blome File:Fragment of Cary's map, 1795, showing location of Whitechapel Mount.png1795 John Cary Whitechapel Mount's position is first depicted in a 1673 building plan by Sir Christopher Wren, where he refers to it as \\"the mud wall called the Fort\\". In Gascoyne's survey of the parish of Stepney (1703) it is called The Dunghill: it is at least 400 yards long, and is crossed not only by a path, but a road. In John Rocque's map of London (1746) it has been horizontally truncated, but is shown with substantial elevation, with at least one dwelling-house ‚Äì if not a terrace of houses ‚Äì on its western end. In Richard Blome's map of 1755 it has a large dwelling-house with front drive and appears alongside the newly built London Hospital. In John Cary's 1795 map its western portion has been truncated by the newly built New Road, but appears to have a substantial building in its northwest corner. Possible origins =Civil War fortification= London fortified. Fort No.2 (top right) is said to be as the origin of the Mount. In 1643 London was hastily fortified against the Royalist armies, for \\"there is terrible news that [Prince] Rupert will sack it and so a complete and sufficient dike and earthern wall and bulwarks must be made\\". Twenty-three or 24 earthern forts were built at intervals around the city and its main suburbs; neighbouring forts were in sight of one another. These forts were manned by volunteers e.g. men too old to be in the regular militia; local innkeepers were ordered to provide them with food. The forts were interconnected by an earth bank and trench, dug by \\"great numbers of men, women and young children\\". All social classes joined in the labour: ::::::From ladies down to oyster-wenches ::::::Labour'd like pioneers in trenches, ::::::Fell to their pick-axes and tools, ::::::And help'd the men to dig like moles.Samuel Butler, Hudibras, cited Brett-James, op. cit,, 4. The completed ring was 18 miles in circumference. A visiting Scotsman walked it; it took him 12 hours. Fort No.2, officially a hornwork with two flanks, commanded the Whitechapel Road. The Scottish traveller, who inspected it, said it was a \\"nine angled fort only pallosaded and single ditched and planted with seven pieces of brazen ordnance [brass cannon], and a court du guard [guardhouse] composed of timber and thatched with tyle stone as all the rest are\\". There was a trench around its base. Daniel Lysons said the earthwork at Whitechapel wasPresumably, when built. Lysons uses the past tense to refer to the fortification itself, not its later accretions; later maps and images show the remains (with accretions) were much larger. 329 foot long, 182 foot broad and more than 25 foot above ground level. After the civil war these fortifications were swiftly removed because they spoiled productive agricultural land. However traces remained and one of these was Whitechapel Mount. Wrote Lysons (1811): \\"The east end was till of late years very perfect; on the west side some houses had been built. The surface on the top, except where it had been dug away, was perfectly level. Mount Street, Mayfair, is another relict name of one of these civil war forts. =Great Plague burial ground= The Great Pit in Aldgate by George Cruikshank ( 1792-1878) In the bubonic epidemic of 1665 an estimated 70,000-100,000 Londoners died of the plague. Aldgate, Whitechapel and Stepney were badly affected. This placed a strain on the burial facilities and some were buried in mass graves. Official mass graves were made by opening a deep pit and leaving it open for as long as it took to fill with cadavers, which was done downwind. The number of lost plague pits in London is commonly exaggerated ‚Äî most mass graves were actually in pre-existing churchyards . However there were some gaps in the records and \\"undoubtedly some temporary and irregular plague burial sites\\". Those willing to man the dead carts (and dispose of the corpses) were not fastidious; a contemporary said they were ‚Äòvery idle base liveing men and very rude\\", drawing attention to their task by swearing and cursing. No contemporaneous record confirms corpses were officially buried in Whitechapel Mount. It is known that there were several burial grounds or plague pits in the vicinity e.g. across the road.Maps of Wren (1673), Rocque (1746) and Blome (1774). Whether the mound was used as a burial ground has been disputed. According to popular tradition, it was. In one version, Whitechapel Mount's origin was that rubble from the Fire of London was thrown over a plague pit to cover it up. These rumours were denied by the authorities when they proposed to remove Whitechapel Mount; they had it \\"pierced\\" in an effort to refute them. The clearest reputable source is the author Joseph Moser, who wrote > In the course of last summer [1802], when part of the rubbish of > [Whitechapel Mount] had just been removed, I had the curiosity to inspect > the place, and observed in the different strata a great number of human > bones, together with those, apparently, of different animals, oxen, or cows, > and sheep‚Äôs horns, bricks, tiles, &c.; The bones and other exuvia of animals > were in many places, especially towards the bottom, bedded in a stiff, > viscid earth, of the blueish colour and consistence of potter's clay, which > was unquestionably the original ground, thrown into different directions, as > different interments operated upon its surface. A complication is that the London Hospital itself may have used the Mount for burials: a hospital history says that by 1764 \\"The Mount Burying Ground was full\\". =Great Fire detritus= The Great Fire of London (Anglo-Dutch school, c.1666), Museum of London The Great Fire of London occurred the year after the plague. The nearest burnt environment was a mile away. Even so, respectable sources asserted that Whitechapel Mount was formed or augmented from rubble from the Fire of London, including Dr Markham the rector of Whitechapel Church, who took pains to investigate the subject. This origin theory was widely believed, though some denied it. When the Mount was dismantled in the 19th century the belief attracted flocks of antique hunters; see below. =Laystall= The above theories about the origin of Whitechapel Mount, by themselves, may not account for its sheer size as shown in the maps and illustrations cited. A laystall was an open rubbish tip; towns relied on them for disposing of garbage, and did so until the sanitary landfills of the 20th century. By legislation of October 1671 seven laystalls were appointed for the City of London. All street sweepings and household rubbish was to be collected in carts and had to be tipped in one of these, and nowhere else. One of them was Whitechapel Mount: it was to receive the rubbish from the wards of Portsoken, Tower, Duke's Place and Lime Street. However, a laystall was more than a passive tip: it was a business. Its proprietor employed gangs of men, women and boys to sort the rubbish and recycle it. Without him, nothing prevented indiscriminate fly-tipping and random lateral spread onto adjoining properties. William Guy who investigated the laystalls of mid-19th century London reported > In most of the laystalls or dustmen's yards, every species of refuse matter > is collected and deposited:‚Äì nightsoil, the decomposing refuse of markets, > the sweepings of narrow streets and courts, the sour-smelling grains from > breweries, the surface soil of the leading thoroughfares, and the ashes from > the houses. The proportion in which these several matters are collected, > vary... In all these establishments the bulk of the deposits consists of > dust from the houses, which is sifted on the spot by women and boys seated > on the dust-heaps, assisted by men who are engaged in filling the sieves, > sorting the heterogeneous materials, or removing and carting them away. The Black Eagle Brewery, like other parts of the East End built environment, incorporated bricks made from Whitechapel Mount While the legislation speaks of \\"dung, soil, filth and dirt\\", most domestic refuse (by volume) comprised household dust typically coal ash ‚Äì hence the expression \\"dustman\\" ‚Äì and this could be used for making bricks. At the close of the 18th century there was a tremendous demand for bricks to build the rapidly expanding London; \\"At night, a 'ring of fire' and pungent smoke encircled the City\\"; there were numerous local brickfields e.g. at Mile End. An Old Bailey case of 1809 records that bricks were being delivered from the diminishing Whitechapel Mount. Removal Irony: A letter pokes fun at amateur antiquarians The construction of the East and West India Docks early in the nineteenth century caused roads to be made through the low marshy fields extending from Shadwell and Ratcliff to Whitechapel. New Street/Cannon Street Road, leading from Whitechapel Mount to St George in the East so increased the value of the land on each side of it, that the Corporation of London decided to take down the Mount. This occurred in 1807‚Äì8, and Mount Place, Mount Terrace, and Mount Street were then built on that site, thus marking the spot where the Mount stood. The process took several years, efforts at first being desultory.Proposals for purchasing and carying away the soil were invited in 1801: Morning Chronicle, 23 March 1801, p.1. Joseph Moser examined the strata in 1802: Work must have ceased, for The Monthly Mirror of July 1806 reported \\"The removal of Whitechapel Mount has commenced\\": Bricks were still being delivered from Whitechapel Mount in 1809: There was even a proposal ‚Äì a prefiguring of the Regent's Canal ‚Äì to bring a canal from Paddington to the docks at Wapping by passing through Whitechapel Mount.Morning Post, 21 January 1803, p.3. The soil of the Mount was used to make bricks, see above, and these were delivered to e.g. Wentworth Street, Bethnal Green and \\"Hanbury's Brewhouse\\" (the Black Eagle Brewery), buildings that stand today. =Antique hunters= Believing it to contain detritus from the Fire of London, flocks of cockney enthusiasts examined the Mount's soil.The Times, 30 July 1805, p.2. Various antiques were found in it ‚Äî or alleged to be found in it, since it gave them provenance ‚Äî including a silver tankard and a Roman coin. The most spectacular find, however, was a carved boar's head with silver tusks; it was, said reputable antiquarians, a genuine memento of the Boar's Head Inn, Eastcheap: setting for Shakespeare plays, Falstaff, Mistress Quickly and so forth, and genuinely burnt down in the Fire of London. Archaeology For lack of access, there has been no systematic archaeological investigation of the site. However, redevelopment of the Royal London Hospital has allowed occasional glimpses. Mackinder (1994), London Hospital Medical College, Newark Building, Grid Reference TQ3456815: Aitken (2005), The Front Green, Royal London Hospital, Grid Reference TQ347816: In theatre, literature and popular song Mysterious finds at the Mount appealed to the public's imagination The Skeleton Witness: or, The Murder at the Mound by William Leman Rede was a play performed on the English and American stage. The villain does a murder and conceals the body in Whitechapel Mount. The crime is done in such a way that, should the remains be discovered, the impoverished hero will get the blame, though innocent. The hero goes abroad for seven years and makes his fortune. On his return to London, about to marry the heroine, he learns, to his horror, that the Mount is to be cleared away, digging to start on the morrow. To stop this, he hurries off to the Mount's owner and buys it at an extravagant price. The vendor, suspicious, wonders if the Mount contains a buried treasure and sends some men to poke around. They discover the skeleton. By a complicated plot twist the hero proves his innocence and gets the girl, both living happily ever after. The Mount was used as a metonymy to denote the east end or extremity of London town, as in \\"from the farthest extent of Whitechapel mount to the utmost limits of St Giles\\", or \\"[the news] was all over town, from Hyde Park Corner to Whitechapel dunghill\\". The Coachman, a popular 18th century song, began ::::::I'm a boy full spunk, and my name's little Joe, ::::::It's I that can tip the long trot; ::::::From Whitechapel-mount up to fam'd Rotten- row, ::::::With the ladies sometimes is my lot.

He was born in Murray County, Tennessee, one of nine children. Two of his brothers died during the American Civil War. In 1867 the family moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where Estes' grandmother lived. He attended school for one term. His first known job was at a restaurant in Nashville, but it's believed that he started working when he was very young, around five years of age, as a slave in the fields. He worked in Nashville between the ages of 16 and 21. The restaurant was moving to Chicago in 1881 where he found another job. He began to work for the Pullman Company in 1883. Throughout the course of his career he managed private Pullman cars for the, Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, the Princess Infanta Eulalia of Spain, Sir Henry Morton Stanley and Ignace Jan Paderewski. These private cars were also known as \\"Palace Cars\\", elaborately decorated in the style of the Gilded Age with chandeliers, air conditions and beds, where gourmet meals were served by former slaves. Between 1894 and 1897, probably related to the Pullman strike of 1894, Estes took another job aboard the RMS Empress of China, sailing from Vancouver to Tokyo. He made the decision to leave Pullman, ending his employment with the company in 1897, and taking a new job managing a luxury private railway car for Arthur Stillwell. In 1907 he took employment with the Chicago subsidiaries of the United States Steel Corporation. His recipe book Good Things to Eat, as Suggested by Rufus: A Collection Of Practical Recipes For Preparing Meats, Game, Fowl, Fish, Puddings, Pastries, Etc. of over 600 recipes was published in 1911. Estes wanted to be recognized both as an accomplished professional chef and a former slave. It's among the first cookbooks written by a black chef (Robert Roberts, Malinda Russell and Abby Fisher wrote earlier cookbooks).

Apparently, two version of the paintings existed, one of which was reportedly destroyed in one of Vienna's fires. The painting was executed around 1873-74. Background Stevens was trained as a painter in Brussels. He finished his studies in Paris and thereupon established himself there. During the Second Empire he pioneered and perfected the domestic interior scene, which the Impressionists later adopted. He was inspired by Pieter de Hooch and Vermeer, and painted both on wood panel and, as in the case of Le bain, on canvas. Stevens made his name in Paris as a painter of beautifully dressed ladies. Unlike Franz Xaver Winterhalter, the official portraitist of the French imperial family, Stevens chose his models among the wealthy upper class ladies. These demi-mondaines were maintained by their wealthy lovers, and passed their time reading books, making themselves up or at salons and exhibitions while waiting for their lovers to return.Leen de Jong, in Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen 1971, p. 4-4b. The model depicted in Le bain can also be seen in Stevens' Souvenirs and Regrets. Painting The painting depicts an apathetic Parisian demi mondaine having a bath. Above the tub there are, fixed to the wall, a swan-shaped tap and a white fixture in the shape of a shell. Instead of holding a bath brush, the model holds two white roses in her right hand, which crosses her body and leans against the tub's side. The rose may be viewed as a symbol of love and beauty, whereas the tap in the shape of a swan neck might refer to the classical myth of Leda and the swan, adding an erotic subtext to the painting.

The agreement was announced by President Donald Trump on September 11, 2020, and followed on from a joint statement, officially referred to as the Abraham Accords, by the United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on August 13, 2020. It was formally signed on September 15, 2020, at the White House in Washington, D.C., and made Bahrain the fourth Arab state to recognize Israel and the second within a month. Background In 2005, Bahrain abandoned its boycott of Israel, in exchange for a free trade agreement with the United States. On May 20‚Äì21, 2017, in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, a summit of 55 Muslim countries and the U.S. discussed ways of rooting out global terrorism. King Salman of Saudi Arabia and the leaders of the Sunni countries, including Bahrain, discussed Iran's growing influence and activities in the Middle East. Israel was not invited to the summit. In September 2017, the King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, denounced the Arab League boycott of Israel, saying that the kingdom's citizens were entitled to visit Israel, even though the two countries had no diplomatic relations, in a speech to Rabbi Marvin Hier, the president of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. On May 8, 2018, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain publicly welcomed and supported the U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, citing Iran‚Äôs destabilizing activities in the Middle East. Israel also supported the U.S. withdrawal. Pressure from Iran's growing influence and involvement in the region has led to Bahrain's support for the Israeli stance against Iran and brought the countries closer. During the May 2018 Israel‚ÄìIran incident in Syria, Bahrain's Foreign Minister expressed support for Israel's \\"right to defend itself\\". On February 13‚Äì14, 2019, both Bahrain and Israel participated in a security conference in Warsaw, Poland, where Iran's growing influence was discussed. Subsequently, relationships between Israel and the Gulf countries grew stronger. On June 25‚Äì26, 2019, Bahrain hosted the \\"Peace to Prosperity\\" workshop in Manama, where the Trump administration presented the economic part of the Trump peace plan. The Palestinian Authority rejected the plan and boycotted the workshop while Israel was not invited, although Israeli journalists were allowed to cover the proceedings. In July 2019, Foreign Minister of Bahrain, Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, and his Israeli counterpart, Israel Katz, met in the United States. In October 2019, an Israeli official, Dana Benvenisti-Gabay, attended the \\"Working Group on Maritime and Aviation Security\\" in Manama, Bahrain. In December 2019, Jerusalem chief rabbi, Shlomo Amar, visited Bahrain for an interfaith event. On August 13, 2020, President Trump announced that the UAE and Israel were to normalize relations under the Israel‚ÄìUnited Arab Emirates peace agreement. Bahrain praised the agreement proclaiming it would contribute to regional stability and peace. Furthermore, as a sign of growing cooperation between the sides, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia permitted overflights of planes from and to Israel, as a sign of support for the deal. White House Abraham Accords signing ceremony on September 15, 2020 Arab states, while still backing Palestinian rights, are increasingly willing to seek a variety of relationships with Israel. The \\"piecemeal\\" approach of the Trump administration makes the best of the inability to secure a resolution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, vying instead to normalize relations between Israel and the rest of the Arab countries. On August 26, 2020, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa told visiting US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that his country is committed to the creation of a Palestinian state and dismissed Washington's push for Arab countries to normalize relations with Israel. However, on September 11, 2020, it was announced that Bahrain and Israel had agreed to establish full diplomatic relations. Remarking on the date of the announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no more powerful response to the hatred that spawned 9/11.‚Äù Agreement The two states agreed to establish diplomatic relations, which is the first step for Bahrain to fully normalize its ties with Israel, and although signifying a circumspect Bahraini acceptance of the legitimacy of Israel, HM King Hamad stressed \\"the need to reach a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic option, in accordance with the two-state solution and relevant resolutions of international legitimacy.\\" Trump said that the two states will exchange ambassadors and open embassies in each country and begin work on cooperation in technology, health, and agriculture, among other areas. The agreement also allows for the establishment of flights between Tel Aviv and Manama. A signing ceremony for the agreement was held in the White House on September 15, 2020.

The mansion was the chilhood home of socialites Dabney Mercer and Tinsley Mortimer. In the 1990s the home was the source of a feud between two prominent Richmond families, the Mercers and the Gottwalds. A previous owner of Graymont, George R. Mercer II, was sued in 1994 by Bruce C.

This showed that, for a non-baryonic cold dark matter not coupled to radiation, the small initial perturbations expected to give rise to the present day large scale structures experience below z_{eq} an additional distinct growth period which alters the initial fluctuation power spectrum, and allows sufficient time for the fluctuations to grow into galaxies and galaxy clusters by the present epoch. This involved introducing and solving a joint radiation plus dark matter perturbation equation for the density fluctuations \\\\Delta \\\\rho, : \\\\delta^{} + \\\\frac{2+3y}{2y(1+y)}\\\\delta^{'} - \\\\frac{3}{2y(1+y)} = 0 , in which \\\\delta \\\\equiv (\\\\Delta\\\\rho/\\\\langle \\\\rho \\\\rangle ), the variable y=(\\\\rho_m/\\\\rho_r)=(a/a_{eq}), and a is the lenghtscale parametrizing the expansion of the Universe.

Enterprise High School's nickname and mascot is the Wolves; the student section is referred to as the Wolf Pack. Enterprise was established in 1896. It was settled by Mormon pioneers who were called to settle the area by church leaders. Shortly thereafter, in 1898, a board of trustees was elected to oversee the needs of the 58 children in the community. The first classes were held in a one-room brick home. When the Young Men's Mutual Hall was completed one year later, the school moved into that building. As the community grew, more space was needed and classes were held at various locations and homes in the community. By 1917, the steadily increasing population had created a need for a more permanent school building. Construction began in 1921 on a new nine-room school building, which was completed in January of 1922. Until 1922, only grades one through eight were held. With the construction of the new building, grades nine and ten were added. Students in eleventh and twelfth grades who wished to complete their education traveled north to Parowan. The latter two grades were added in 1927. For many years thereafter, grades one through 12 were held in the same building. In 1986, a new building was erected a few blocks southeast of the old school to house grades seven through 12.

Production  Matthew Wilder & David Zippel had written the song originally for Hanson, but the deal eventually fell through. They were subsequently asked to alter the song to give it a \\"Stevie Wonder feel\\". The writers previously had the opportunity to work with famous performers like dubbing artist Marni Nixon, though were \\"excited and astonished\\" to work with Wonder. Wilder recalled: \\"While sitting in the studio waiting for Wonder's arrival, some guy walks in and sets up a keyboard and then walks out with saying a word. After several hours passed, Wonder finally arrived. I peaked my head out into the hallway in time to see him floating down this long hallway in this floor-length dashiki. He looked like an African god.\\" Wilder and Zippel didn't have a clear collaboration in mind when calling Wonder into the studio. Initially they had asked him to play harmonica on the track. Wonder said that he liked the song, describing it as \\"a song I would've written back in the '70s and I‚Äôm into it\\" and offered to sing on it. Meanwhile, 98 Degrees had recently released their debut album with just one single \\"Invisible Man\\" and the album failed to chart. The band's next creative step following this was to explore the international markets of Asia and Europe and record \\"True to Your Heart\\" with Stevie Wonder for Disney's Mulan soundtrack which led them to wider recognition.  Release  The song was released as the first single off the soundtrack and was nominated for the 1998 Grammy Awards in the category of Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. The song has different lyrics in the movie than on the soundtrack. The song reached 51 on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1998. Sandy and Jr. interpreted the song in Portuguese as \\"Seu Cora√ß√£o\\". Raven-Symone recorded the song in 2004 for the soundtrack to Ella Enchanted and Disneymania 2. Both versions were released on 2004's Mulan: Special Edition.  Critical reception  MTV described it as a \\"celebratory tune that captures the mood of the film's conclusion\\" a la \\"Circle of Life\\".

The Act was in response to changing technologies that had developed since the gas industry was nationalised in 1949. To finance the increased scope of the Gas Council the Gas (Borrowing Powers) Act 1965 (1965 chapter 60) was enacted which increased the Council‚Äôs borrowing powers to up to ¬£1,200 million.  Background  The government recognised that there had been significant technological progress and changes in the gas industry since nationalisation in 1949. There were new possibilities of undertaking large-scale supply schemes associated with the import of liquefied natural gas from Algeria and the discovery of natural gas on the UK Continental Shelf.Hansard, House of Lords, Gas Bill, 20 May 1965 There were also opportunities for underground gas storage. Such storage enabled the industry to build up a reserve of gas in summer, when demand was low, which was drawn down to meet the higher demand in winter. The Gas Act 1965 had two main purposes: to make changes in the structure of the gas industry; and to allow the industry to develop underground storage of gas in natural strata. A subsidiary purpose was to amend Section 52 of the 1948 Act dealing with the industry's monopoly of piped gas supplies for use as fuel. The Gas Council was given powers to manufacture gas and supply it to the Area Boards. The increased scope of work of the Gas Council was financed by increased borrowing. The limit had been ¬£650 million, the Gas (Borrowing Powers) Act 1965 was enacted which increased the Council‚Äôs borrowing to up to ¬£1,200 million.  Gas Act 1965  The Gas Act 1965 (1965 c. 36) received Royal Assent on 5 August 1965. Its long title is: ‚ÄòAn Act to confer additional functions on the Gas Council and to make further provision as to the rating of the Gas Council and Area Gas Boards; to increase the number of members of the Gas Council; to regulate and facilitate the storage of gas by the Council and those Boards in underground strata, and to modify section 52 of the Gas Act 1948; and for connected purposes.‚Äô = Provisions = The provisions of the Act comprise 37 Sections in 3 Parts and 6 Schedules * Part I ‚Äì The Gas Council ** Section 1. Empowered the Gas Council to manufacture and supply gas and solid fuels ** Section 2. Empowered the Minister to appoint additional members of the Gas Council ** Section 3. Rating of the Gas Council and other gas authorities * Part II ‚Äì Underground storage of gas by gas authorities ** Sections 4 to 28 concerning the authorisation, control, compensation, rights, responsibilities liabilities, safety conditions for the underground storage of gas * Part III ‚Äì General ** Section 29. Modification of section 52 of principal Act, allowed sale of gas for industrial purposes which do not consist of or include the use as a fuel ** Section 30. General powers of gas authorities ** Section 31. Financial provisions ** Section 32. Short title, interpretation, extent and commencement * Schedules ** Schedule 1. Amendments as respects functions of Gas Council ** Schedule 2. Storage Authorisation Orders ** Schedule 3. Certificates and Statutory Licences ** Schedule 4. Acquisition of land ** Schedule 5. Inquiries into accidents ** Schedule 6. Power to enter land and to prospect and survey Land  Consequences of the Act  The effect of the Act was to put the Gas Council on a par with the Area Gas Boards. It was enabled ‚Äòto manufacture gas, to get or acquire gas in or from Great Britain or elsewhere and to supply gas in bulk to any area board. It was also enabled to manufacture, treat, supply or sell solid fuels, products or by-products, in the same way as the area boards. The Gas Council played an increasing role in the direction of the British gas industry. It acted as the central purchaser of Natural gas from Algeria and the North Sea, the distribution of which was national enterprise. The Act allowed the Minister to appoint three extra members to the Gas Council Board, this was increased to five in 1968.  Gas (Borrowing Powers) Act 1965  The increased remit of the Gas Council was reflected in the Gas (Borrowing Powers) Act 1965 which was enacted to increase the Council's financial limit from ¬£650 million to ¬£900 million, although the Minister of Power was empowered to increase this to ¬£1,200 million. The Gas Council expected that ¬£1,000 million would cover its requirements to 1970. As a consequence of the Section 1(3)(a) of the Gas and Electricity Act 1968 the Gas (Borrowing Powers) Act 1968 ceased to have effect.  Later enactments  Sections 1‚Äì3, 29 and 30 of the 1965 Act were repealed by the Gas Act 1972 The Gas Act 1986 amended parts of the Gas Act 1965  See also  * Oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom * Gas Boards * Gas Council * British Gas  References  Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1965 Category: Natural gas industry in the United Kingdom ","title":"Gas Act 1965"},{"id":"65289106","text":"The 2020‚Äì21 Croatian Women's Football Cup is the 30th season of the annual Croatian football cup competition.

December 31, 1839, Ia»ôi, Moldavia - d. December 20, 1914, AsƒÉu, BacƒÉu County, Kingdom of Romania) was a Romanian explorer, politician and captain in the United States Armed Forces during the Civil War. Biography The son of the boyar, doctor of law, Aga Niculae Ghica- ComƒÉne»ôtenul (1798-1853) and of Ecaterina, born Plagino, Eugen was born in the Ghica family which, starting with the 17th century, gave the Danubian Principalities ten rulers. His father bequeated an important fortune, 81,707 hectares of land, which were divided into ten estates, each of the five brothers (Dimitrie, Maria, Eugen, Nicolae and Gheorghe) receiving two domains. Twin brother with Dimitrie Ghica-ComƒÉne»ôti, Eugen married Jeanne-Catherine Ke»ôco, thus becoming brother-in-law with Milan Obrenoviƒá, the King of Serbia, whose mother was from the Sturdza family. His participation in the American Civil War (1861-1865) was mentioned in the Romanian press of his time, in the Buciumul newspaper. In 1866 Matei Sturza, the prefect of Boto»ôani county, referred to the participation of E.G.C. in the American Civil War as \\"a man who, during the American war, showed his worth under the command of Lincoln, the new Washington!\\" Involvement in the American Civil War In 1861, following the appeal from Abraham Lincoln, he enlisted as a volunteer in the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry. Wounded on the battlefield, Eugen was decorated and promoted to the rank of captain. On July 30th, 1862, he sent a letter of condolence from a military hospital in New York for the death of Nicolae Dunca, another Romanian volunteer in the Civil War. This letter, addressed to Mrs. Constan»õa Dunca-Schianu, will be published on January 16th, 1863 in the newspaper Buciumul, published in Bucharest by Cezar Bolliac. On April 30th, 1863, at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he was a captain in the 5th Volunteer Regiment, and took part in the campaign of General Nathaniel Banks. In May he went briefly to New Orleans, then to Key West in Florida. By order of June 6th, 1863, he became commander of the I Company, of the 10th Regiment of the Corps d'Afrique, consisting of black recruits, with camp set up in Port Hudson. For family reasons, on December 24th, 1863, he demanded his resignation, which was accepted on December 31st. He returned to Romania through Berlin, where, for two weeks, he visited the city, then returned to the ComƒÉne»ôti estate. Here he was searched by his friends, who were impressed by the host's war stories. Political activity Entering political life, he was elected in 1869 member of the Parliament for BacƒÉu County. In 1875, wanting to join the army, he addressed the American consul in Bucharest, Benjamin Franklin Peixotto, to certify his activity in the American Army. The consul's approach to the American forums, in which he also recommends E.G.C. for its merits, have been fruitless. From 1879 until his death Eugen was the permanent representative of BacƒÉu County in the Parliament, standing on firm anti-dynastic positions, especially in 1871 during the disorders caused by the Strussberg Affair and the Franco-Prussian War.

The agreement was preceded by lengthy negotiations, which began back in 1928.Andrey Gromyko. History of the Foreign Policy of the Soviet Union, 1917‚Äì1980 Background In the spring of 1931, Franco‚ÄìSoviet relations, which had been in crisis since the fall of 1930, were revived. On April 20, 1931, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs to conclude a non‚Äìaggression pact and a trade treaty for both countries. Moscow welcomed these proposals and on August 10, 1931, the Soviet Union and France initialed a non‚Äìaggression pact. Unexpectedly, in September 1931, the √âlys√©e Palace demanded that the Soviet‚ÄìFrench non‚Äìaggression pact be accompanied by a non‚Äìaggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland. In January 1932, Paris added that the preliminary signing of a similar agreement between Moscow and Bucharest had become mandatory for the conclusion of a Franco‚ÄìSoviet non‚Äìaggression pact. The improbability of an imminent signing of a Soviet‚ÄìFrench non‚Äìaggression pact became apparent in the spring of 1932, when the head of the French government Andr√© Tardieu announced the idea of rapprochement between the five Danube countries (Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia). The move drew criticism in Moscow. Despite the fact that the Danube project of Tardieu was positioned as an anti‚ÄìGerman initiative, Soviet diplomats suspected that the emergence of the Danube federation posed a military threat to the Soviet Union. In May 1932, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the All‚ÄìUnion Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed the study of the problems of the war of the Central European states against the Soviet Union and the role of France. However, the Tardieu project was not implemented due to the confrontation between Germany and Italy. With the resignation of Tardieu and the formation of the √âdouard Herriot government on June 3, 1932, Soviet‚ÄìFrench contacts returned to a dynamic character. This was facilitated by the fact that on July 25, 1932, Moscow signed a non‚Äìaggression pact with Warsaw. In August 1932, a major contract was signed for the supply of Soviet oil to France, and Herriot told Dovgalevsky, the Plenipotentiary of the Soviet Union in Paris, that he did not want to subordinate the Soviet‚ÄìFrench pact to the Soviet‚ÄìRomanian one. Agreement As a result, the Franco‚ÄìSoviet non‚Äìaggression pact was signed on November 29, 1932.Alexander Peganov.

In 2002, Forster returned to London to train at the Royal Ballet Upper School. In 2006, Forster moved to New York City to join the American Ballet Theatre Studio Company, became an apprentice with the main company in January 2007 and was taken to the corps de ballet in December. As a corps dancer he partnered with principal dancer Julie Kent in Jardin aux lilas when his scheduled partner was injured. He was made soloist in 2015 and principal dancer in 2020. Forster is also a National Academy of Sports Medicine certified personal trainer, and trains his colleagues at ABT. Forster is married to fellow ABT dancer Leann Underwood and has a son.

After her marriage and her move to , she became a music teacher and private music teacher for violin, recorder and piano.Beate Albrecht by  Music education  Albrecht developed a concept of solmisation: laying down notes instead of writing notes. The graphic representation of notes makes the structure and regularity of tone systems comprehensible and promotes the learning process. The syllables of relative solmisation lead the student to consciously grasp the tonal relationships and interval tensions, to experience and appreciate the gradual character of the tones. She recorded her methodological experiences with relative solmisation in music lessons and used her findings to develop teaching aids and accompanying materials for music lessons. Relative solmisation has become a proven method for helping children to make the transition from an intuitive to a rational understanding of music - especially musical notation.Juliane Ribke: Musikalische Fr√ºherziehung.

It lived during the upper Miocene (about 11.63 - 5 million years ago) and its fossil remains have been found in Italy (Gargano). The type species is M. magna, although two other species (M. maiuscula and M. parka) are also known.M. Freudenthal. 1976. Rodent stratigraphy of some Miocene fissure fillings in Gargano (prov.

Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 26(3):784 Garganoaetus freudenthali preying on a Mikrotia .sp Description This animal, despite belonging to the Muridae, was much larger in size than its modern equivalents. The only known skull of the largest species, Mikrotia magna, was about long. The three known species of the genus Mikrotia show an evolutionary tendency towards the development of hypsodontal molars (with a high crown) and in the increase of the number of dental lobes in the first lower molar (as happened later to modern voles). The oldest specimens of the genus were still characterized by a dental pattern typical of murids, consisting of a succession of three parallel rows of cusps. However, an additional lobe was already present in the anterior part of the lower first molar. In a rather rapid evolutionary succession, various successive species of Mikrotia developed more and more additional lobes and increased hypsodontia. In the last and largest species, M. magna, the first lower molar had acquired a pattern totally similar to that of voles, with six rows of transverse ridges. Classification Mikrotia is represented by three species (M. parva, M. maiuscula and M. magna), all found in the fissure deposits of Gargano. During the Miocene Gargano became an island and developed insular fauna, including large rodents. Mikrotia developed from unknown continental forms (perhaps Parapodemus, with which the older species of Mikrotia share the shape of the lower molars) and later its size increased, as did dental specializations. Freudenthal initially described these species in the genus Microtia in 1976 (with reference to Microtus, a vole with similar teeth), but later the same scholar renamed the genus to Mikrotia in 2006, since the name Microtia was already preoccupied by a butterfly genus named in 1864.\\"Microtia Bates, 1864\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms Mikrotia, despite the affinities of the dentition with those of the arvicolines, belongs to the Muridae on the basis of cranial characteristics.Parra, V., Jaeger, J.-J. & Bocherens, H. 1999 06 15: The skull of Microtia, an extinct burrowing murine rodent of the late Neogene Gargano palaeoisland.

He claims the Guild Masons at the quarry refused to work with him, but when he joined the Operative Society after a few days he received total support from them. Stretton thereafter worked his way through the degrees of the Operative Masonry. In 1871 also became initiated into Speculative Freemasonry at the Leicester Lodge. Stretton was appointed Mayor of Leicester in 1877‚Äì8 at age 28. Stretton was a prolific railway writer but there are wide and strong concerns about inaccuracies and the possible fabrications of stories. In 1908 Stretton re-visited the Derby Lodge and noted a substantial decline in membership. This initiated Stretton into an attempt to make efforts to revive Guild Masonry and ensure the traditions were not lost.

August 2020 On 23 and 24 August 2020, protests took place in Tripoli, Misrata and Zawiya over issues of power and water cuts, lack of fuel and cooking gas, cash shortages, poor security, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Armed forces associated with the GNA shot at the demonstrators, causing injuries. The Interior Ministry stated that demonstrators had the right to peacefully protest and that the ministry had opened criminal investigations into the shootings. The Tripoli Protection Force also declared its support for the right of citizens to carry out street protests. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) also called for an investigation. Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha criticised the gunmen, stating that live ammunition was used \\"indiscriminately\\", and that the gunmen had kidnapped demonstrators and \\"[sowed] panic among the population and [threatened] security and public order\\". Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj responded to the protests with a long speech, with the suspension of Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha, and with a Cabinet reshuffle.

On July 26, 2002, the Boeing 727-232F aircraft flying this route crashed during landing at Tallahassee. All three flight crew members survived the accident with serious injuries, but the aircraft was destroyed.  Aircraft and crew  The aircraft involved in 1987, while still in service with Gulf Air Transport The aircraft involved was a Boeing 727-232 freighter registered as N497FE (serial number 20866 - line number 1067), that had its first flight on September 3, 1974. The aircraft was delivered to Delta Air Lines on September 13, 1986, and it transferred to FedEx on December 2 the same year. It was then transferred to TAP Air Portugal which leased it to Air Atlantis. In December 1987 the aircraft was subleased to Gulf Air Transport. The aircraft was later returned to FedEx and December 13, 1989, and it was converted into a freighter. The three flight crew members were the aircraft's only occupants. The captain was 55-year-old William Walsh who had been with FedEx Express since 1989 and had a total of 13,000 to 14,000 hours of flight experience, including 2,754 hours on the Boeing 727. His latest medical certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) required him to wear corrective lenses in flight. The first officer was 44-year-old William Frye, who had been with Fedex since 1997, having previously served as United States Navy pilot for 16 years. He had 8,500 flight hours, with 1,983 of them on the Boeing 727. According to his recent medical certificate, Frye was color blind but passed the Navy's color vision tests a total of 13 times. The flight engineer was 33-year-old David Mendez, who had been with FedEx Express for less than a year and had 2,600 flight hours, including 346 hours on the Boeing 727.  Accident  Flight 1478 departed at 4:12 AM EDT, with first officer Frye as the pilot flying. The flight was initially on a visual approach to runway 27 due to wind gusts. However, after reviving a weather update at 5:24, the flight crew changed to a straight-in visual approach to Runway 09. Aerial view of the crash site Tail section At 5:30, first officer Frye said, \\"okay, I think I got a runway now.\\" The flight crew then discussed the runway and the position of the aircraft. At 5:36, Flight 1478 was descending by and turning towards runway 09 from the airfield traffic pattern. At this time the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights displayed one red light, and three white lights. The aircraft was slightly below the final approach fix, but the crew failed to notice. 30 seconds before impact at , all four PAPI lights were red. The ground proximity warning system (GPWS) sounded a \\"five hundred\\" feet above ground level warning. At 5:37, with the landing gear lowered and the flaps at 30 degrees, the aircraft impacted trees located short of the runway. The aircraft remained airborne for and then crashed into the ground sliding , striking a construction vehicle in the process, and rotating 260 degrees before coming to a stop.  Investigation  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted an investigation into the accident, determining that the cause of the accident was the flight crew's failure to maintain an appropriate flight path during a visual approach at night. The flight crew were also fatigued and did not adhere to standard operating procedures (SOP). The flight crew testified the approach was normal until the last moment, and none of them said that all four PAPIs were red. The approach was un-stabilized above ground level, and the flight crew failed to initiate a go-around. First officer Frye also underwent an eye test after the accident, revealing that it was difficult for him to distinguish between red, green and white. The NTSB concluded that based on the results this made it difficult for Frye to distinguish between the color of the PAPI lights.

Pearce was once a thriving mining town which depended on the nearby Commonwealth Mine, a gold and silver mine and later became a ghost town after the mines were depleted. Included is a photographic gallery of some of the remaining historic structures, two of which are individually identified as historic by the National Register of Historic Places. . Brief history According to Archaeological findings Pearce and the surrounding area of what is now Cochise County was inhabited by the Clovis Man, the name given to the members of the prehistoric Paleoamerican culture the Clovis culture, until the end of the last Ice Age. Other tribes such as the Anasazi people, the Hohokam and the Agrarians later resided in the area up until 1400 AD. Spanish explorers lead by Don Francisco Vazquez de Coronado entered Cochise County in search of the ‚ÄúSeven Cities of Cibola‚Äù where according to Spanish legend, the streets were paved with gold. By then the area was inhabited by the members of the Solado tribe. By 1700 AD, the Solado's were eventually driven out of the area by the Apaches. The Apaches did not like the colonization of their lands by the Spaniards and didn‚Äôt want to be converted to a new religion (Christianity). By 1775, the Apaches had driven the Spaniards out.Pearce ;Cochise County, Arizona James Pearce and his wife lived in the town of Tombstone were he worked the mines while his wife managed a boarding house. The Pearce family, which included two sons and a daughter, decided to move to Sulphur Springs Valley, where they established a ranch with the money that they had saved. James Pearce and his sons were busy with their ranching activities when the elder Pearce decided to take a rest. While resting he picked up a rock and threw it against a rock edge. When the rock broke he realized that the rock contained gold. He took it to an assay in Tombstone and was told that the rock in question had a high ore content of both gold and silver. The specimen was assayed at $22,000 per ton in silver and $5,000 per ton in gold.centennial edition celebrating the cochise school library building 1911-2011 the early history of the town of cochise, arizona Immediately the Pearce family filed mining claims and began to work on the claims.

The Ghost Town Trail ‚Äì Gleeson, Courtland & PearceWelcome to the Sonoran Desert and Cochise County John Brockman, a businessman from Silver City, New Mexico, heard about the gold mine and became interested in purchasing the mine. After meeting with Pearce, he convinced him to sell the mine. Pearce reached an agreement where he would sell the mine for $250,000 with an added stipulation. The stipulation required that Brockman had 90 days to work the mine and it guaranteed that Mrs. Pearce would be the person to run a boardinghouse beside the mine. The deal between Brockman and the Pearce family was finalized and thus Brockman became the new owner of the Commonwealth Mine. It wasn't long before a small settlement called Fittsburg was established close to the mine and about one mile east of the town of Pearce.Arizona Ghost Town Trails The town of Pearce Burt AlvordBill Downing In 1896, a post office was established and the town was named Pearce. Dozens of businesses from Tombstone moved to Pearce and a growth in the new towns population followed. The population of Pearce in 1919 was 1,500. Brockman built a 200-stamp mill, however criminal activities by miners and outlaws followed the path of the town's progress. Burt Alvord was hired and named deputy by George Bravin. It wasn't long before Alvard became an outlaw who formed a gang known as the Alvord-Stiles Gang. The gang was dedicated to robbing trains throughout the Arizona Territory.They often used the town of Pearce as their headquarters. Another infamous outlaw who lived in Pearce was Bill Downing. Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Downing became a member of the Alvord-Stiles Gang and together with the gang robbed the Cochise Train Station and attempted to rob the Fairbank train. Downing was eventually captured, tried and sentenced to a prison term in the Yuma Territorial Prison. In 1882, close to the town of Pearce on East Turkey Creek Road, the infamous outlaw Johnny Ringo was found dead. He was found propped against a tree and shot through the head. There are many unproven theories and speculations as to if he committed suicide or was murdered. Ringo was a member of the Clanton Cowboy Gang of Tombstone when the gang was at war with Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and Morgan and Virgil Earp. Ringo is buried where he fell.Johnny Ringo gravesite By 1896, the Commonwealth Mine had reached its peak in producing gold and silver. That same year the Soto Bros. and Renaud Store was built. The two story building, which as of 2020 still stands, was built with cedar and redwood beams. Later a cast metal facade was added to the front of the building. The building, which now is known as the Pearce General Store, was one of the largest adobe structures in Cochise CountyMining History. The Commonwealth Mine continued to operate until 1930 when it was depleted. The closing of the mine and the world wide depression of the 1930s hit the once prosperous town hard and soon the residents began to move out. These two major events were the main reasons that the town became the ghost town it is today.

It is home to the city's main representative buildings, including the St. Lawrence Cathedral, the Palazzo Comunale (City Hall) and the Palazzo Aldobrandeschi, seat of the Province of Grosseto. The northern section of the square is called Piazza Duomo, since it is overlooked by the cathedral's fa√ßade.

The city hall was designed in 1867 by engineer Giovanni Clive, and built in a Neo-Renaissance style between 1870 and 1873. Its construction required the demolition of the 16th-century church of San Giovanni Decollato (St. John the Baptist) which stood here. =Palazzo Alben= Palazzo Alben is located on the western side of Piazza Duomo, opposite the cathedral. The palace was built between 1948 and 1950 by the enterprise ALBEN, on the site of the medieval , which was demolished in 1938 by the Fascist city government in order to build the new headquarters of the National Institute for Social Security.

Early life He was born in Waddewarden, Wangerland, Friesland, Lower Saxony on 10 May 1789. His father was Reverend Johann Gerhard Tiarks and his mother was Christine Dorothea Ehrentraut. Education He received a doctorate in mathematics from the University of G√∂ttingen in 1808. He took a position as a private tutor. Flight to England He fled to England in 1810 to avoid conscription by Napoleon. He became assistant librarian and factotum to Joseph Banks at the Royal Society. First visit to North America In 1817, on Bank's reccomendation, he was appointed an astronomer to one of the commmissions established uner the Treaty of Ghent. He acted for Joseph Bouchette who fell ill that year. He remained with the commission after Bouchette was replaced with William Franklin Odell. In September 1817 he arrived in Akwesasne to make astronomical observations. He befriended many of the local Mohawk people and their priest, Father Joseph Marcoux. At the end of July 1818 Tiarks and his group left Akwesasne and with the American surveying team headed to Lake Champlain. Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler headed the American team. At the lake both teams independently discovered that John Collins and others had incorrectly located the 45th parallel north, placing the fort at Rouses Point, New York in British territory. The American members of the boundary commission refused to accept the findings. Hassler had been replaced as astronomer by Andrew Ellicott, who was far less cooperative. Ellicott was reported as saying to Tiarks \\"we should not do our work so exactingly and forget about completing most of it\\". Tiarks refused to go along with the suggestion, as he felt it put his reputation on the line. He was strongly supported in this by British Commissioner Thomas Henry Barclay. In 1819 he was working in the upper Connecticut River basin where part of the boundary was to run. During summer 1820 he was working in what became northwestern New Brunswick and nearby areas of Quebec, returning to the upper Connecticut that fall. Disputes between British and Amerian commissioners brought his work to a halt and he returned to Europe in 1821. Personal life In 1822 he married Auguste Antoinette Sophie Toel of Jever. They had several children, but only one daughter survived to adulthood. Second visit to North America He returned to North America in 1825 to determine the most northwesterly point of the Lake of the Woods, from which the boundary was supposed to run due west to the Mississippi River. From 1826 to 1830 he worked on matters of concern to the boundary commission. He was called to The Hague to explain certain points to William II of the Netherlands, who had been asked to arbitrate the boundary question. Tiarks returned to Jeven. Final years and death He long wished to be a professor in a German university, but no position every became available. In March 1837 he suffered from a stroke from which he never recovered. The Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty, which settled the boundary disputes in question, was signed in 1842.

It is Stevens' revision of the Biblical figure of Mary Magdalene. The work has been in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent since 2001. The painting was ordered by the Parisian merchant Georges Petit. Painting Alfred Stevens, painter of the mundane life in Paris, met the actress Sarah Bernhardt around 1887. He made several portraits of her. In some of them she posed as a character from history or literature. In this painting we see Bernhardt as Mary Magdalene, the gospel courtesan who later converted and retired as a recluse. The long hair, the skull - the vanitas symbol par excellence - and the desolate landscape in the background are part of an iconographic tradition that goes back to the Middle Ages. Typical of the nineteenth century is the manifest sensuality and the melancholic, almost hallucinatory gaze wherewith Mary Magdalene looks at the viewer. This blurs the religious context of the character. The challenging character of the work, yet completely in keeping with the figure of Mary Magdalene, shocked the general public who preferred to see her portrayed as the repentant penitent.

These acts are also known under the name of the Senkata and Sacaba Massacre. In these events, violent protesters were repressed by military and police forces who had previously got immunity for their crimes by the Bolivian government.  Events  On November 15th, a strong contingent of cocalero groups related to Movement for Socialism (MAS) party tried to enter the city of Cochabamba. During clashes with the police, the security forces of that country seized a large amount of money, firearms and explosives from these protesters. After clashes with the police, 6 dead and 115 wounded were reported. On the 16th of that same month, the Minister of Government, Arturo Murillo, confirmed that most of the deaths came from the protesters themselves while they were fighting with the police. On November 19th, the government decides to break the blockades in the town of Senkata. According to the country's press, numerous radical supporters of the Movement for Socialism tried to enter the natural gas processing plant in that town with the intention of blowing it up. By the 20th of that same month, the terrorists, identified as Deybi Posto Cusi, Edwin Jamachi Paniagua and a third deceased who had not yet been identified, lost their lives by using dynamite to blow up the walls of the plant, therefore that that same day, the Government denounced these events as terrorist acts. On November 20th of 2019, the security forces of the country, by order of the Public Ministry, managed to arrest and preventive detention of seven people for acts of terrorism in the country. Investigations into the events are currently ongoing.  Controversy over the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights declarations  On December 11, 2019, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights classified the deaths of civilians that occurred in the cities of El Alto and Sacaba as massacres, backed by the promulgation of Decree 4078 that allegedly exempted the Bolivian armed forces from criminal responsibility, a decree that was promoted and promulgated by the Government of Jeanine √Å√±ez. This decree would be repealed days later due to pressure from popular sectors. In any case, the IACHR ignores the fact that the violence broke out after the protesters used explosive devices, dynamite, and the police found people, among the protesters, who had firearms. For all this, the country's press media have classified the IACHR's declarations as biased. Among the main critics of the IACHR are several ex Ombudsmen, who also expressed that this statements were \\"biased\\". On the other hand, it generated suspicious that the judge of the IACHR, Eugenio Ra√∫l Zaffaroni was, at the same time, a lawyer of former President Evo Morales. After the discovery of this, Zaffaroni was removed from the case.

It depicts a young woman in a blue kimono standing in front of a mirror. The painting testifies to Stevens' involvement with Japonisme. Stevens was one of the earliest collectors of Japanese art in Paris.Stevens ging als geen ander mee met het toentertijd sterk in mode zijnde Japonisme. Context During the Kaei era (1848‚Äì1854), after more than 200 years of seclusion, foreign merchant ships of various nationalities began to visit Japan. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan ended a long period of national isolation and became open to imports from the West, including photography and printing techniques. With this new opening in trade, Japanese art and artifacts began to appear in small curiosity shops in Paris and London. Japonisme began as a craze for collecting Japanese art, particularly ukiyo-e. Some of the first samples of ukiyo-e were to be seen in Paris.Yvonne Thirion, japonisme en France dans la seconde moiti√© du XIXe si√®cle √† la faveur de la diffusion de l'estampe japonaise\\", 1961, Cahiers de l'Association internationale des √©tudes francaises, Volume 13, Num√©ro 13, pp. 117‚Äì130. DOI 10.3406/caief.1961.2193 Girl in Kimono, same period The Ukiyo-e became a great influence on painting and the decorative arts. At that time, Japonisme influenced Steven' work, just as James McNeill Whistler's, to whom Stevens was close (Whistler was especially close to Tissot in the 1870s and to Stevens in the 1880s). Starting from the 1860s, paintings by Whistelr's friends Stevens and James Tissot depict European women whose enthralled gazes directed at East Asian objects seem to \\"invest those objects with uncanny vitality.\\" Both Stevens and Whistler best expressed this exotic influence in a series of female portraits. La parisienne japonaise is a typical example therof. Almost all objects on display are Japanese and probably come from Stevens's personal collection. Painting La parisienne japonaise shows a sophisticated woman in an elegantly decorated blue kimono, with a fan in her right hand, standing in front of a mirror in which she looks at herself somewhat absentmindedly. The mirrored image also gives the viewer an impression of the space in which she is located. A vase of lowers is thus visible via the mirror on the left. The background is relatively empty, and a folding screen behind the young woman prevents from further inquiring into her whereabouts, so that the attention automatically returns to the model and her colorful, exotic dress.

Reservoirs are considered \\"installations containing dangerous forces\\" under international humanitarian law because of their potential adverse impact. In 1975 the failure of the Banqiao Reservoir Dam and other dams in Henan Province, China caused more casualties than any other dam failures in history. The disaster killed an estimated 171,000 peopleOsnos, Evan. \\"Faust, China, and Nuclear Power,\\" The New Yorker, Wednesday October 12, 2011.

Because reservoirs and their containing dams present such significant potential risks many countries have put legislation in place and set safety standards, but it was not until 1930 that effective legislation was first approved for control of the design, construction and maintenance of dams and reservoirs when the Reservoirs (Safety provisions) Act, 1930 was enacted in the United Kingdom. Causes of failure Although failure is often portrayed as a catastrophic failure of the dam wall to contain the mass of water held up behind the dam, there a number of significant other causes of failure. These include: * Inadequate spillway capacity resulting in water overtopping the dam wall and cascading down the unprotected wall causing erosion and eventually collapse * The dam inadequately bonded to the underlying rock allowing seepage under the dam wall resulting in erosion and undercutting of the dam. * Insufficient geological surveying pre-construction allowing water to seep out at a location away from the dam and erode a new discharge channel. * Spillway of inadequate construction allowing erosion and degradation of the face of the dam from routine discharges. * Geological subsidence because of poor geology, mining or oil extraction. * Inadequate capacity of discharge pipework because of blocking or corrosion. * Inadequate design for actual rainfall events Status by country Not all countries have specific legislative control over the safety of dams and reservoirs, and a number of those that do have legislation have it at State or province level only. Some such as the US have both Federal and State legislation. In some, such as Australia legislation is at State level but only some states have relevant legislation. =Australia= Australia issued \\"Guidelines on Dam Safety Management in 1994\\" but specific safety legislation is enacted at State level. New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have all enacted legislation. In Queensland a concept of a \\"referable dam\\" is used to determine whether the legislation applies. A referable dam is defined by a number of criteria including a height exceeding and a volume of . A number of other conditions and caveats apply. In New South Wales the Dams Safety Act establishes an expert committee to oversee surveillance of \\"prescribed\\" dams. The list of prescribed dams is not based on height or volumes but is a list contained in a schedule to the Act. =New Zealand= The government of New Zealand is consulting the public about the proposal to establish legislative control over the design, construction and monitoring of dams and reservoirs. . The consultation include proposed definitions of \\"classifiable\\" dams which would be either \\"at or above 4 metres in height and 20,000 cubic metres in volume; or less than 4 metres in height, but at or above 30,000 cubic metres in volume\\". The document acknowledges the special issues facing New Zealand because of the frequency of potentially damaging earthquakes. =United Kingdom= In Britain, the demand for water for the many industries that flourished in the industrial revolution and the need for drinking water for the thousands of workers who had migrated from the countryside to the cities for work, put great strains on the water supply infrastructure and led to the construction of many reservoirs in the hillier parts of the country, especially in the Pennines and mid and north Wales. In the absence of any legislation or control of quality or design it was inevitable that failures would occur and by 1963 at least 12 dams had failed causing loss of life. In 1864 however a newly constructed dam at Dale Dyke near Sheffield failed as the reservoir was being filled and the resultant out- wash killed 244 people. As a result, a draft bill requiring dams and reservoirs to have their plans and the construction approved by an independent competent person was written in 1865 but was lost when there was change of government Reservoirs (Safety provisions) Act, 1930 This act was prompted onto the statute book by the coupled failure of two reservoirs in North Wales. Llyn Eigiau and Llyn Coedty were two relatively small reservoirs. On a very wet November night, Eigiau failed and the out-wash overwhelmed Coedty 2.5 miles downstream. Sixteen villagers in Dolgarrog were killed. The new Act applied to reservoirs holding more than and mandated that construction had to be supervised by a qualified engineer and the filling of the reservoir also had to be supervised and certified. It also set out for the first time an inspection requirement that every qualifying reservoir had to be inspected every ten years by an engineer included on a published list or panel of engineers. These panels were compiled by the relevant Secretary of State in liaison with the president of the Institute of Civil Engineers. Since the Act came into force no lives have been lost in any reservoir or dam failure in the UK. Reservoirs Act 1975 Despite the success of the 1930 Act, further legislation was brought onto the statue books in 1975. The new legislation recognised that more significant people were involved in the design and construction of a dam and the impoundment and it assigned accountabilities to those identified players. It also raised the volume threshold to and \\"provides the legal framework within which qualified civil engineers make technical decisions\\" It also recognised the role of Supervising Engineer - a role assigned to the appropriate local authority. However, implementation of the at took from 10 to 12 years as it was not fully implemented until 1987 and then in 2004 the role of Supervising Engineer was reassigned to the Environment Agency. =United States= A series of severe dam failures in the 1970s prompted congress to take action. These failures included Buffalo Creek, West Virginia which failed, devastating a 16-mile valley and killing 125 people. As a result, Congress enacted Public Law 92‚Äì367 in November 1977 which authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to inventory and inspect non-Federal dams. The Water Resources Act 1986 established a National Dam Safety Review Board although there was not a National Dam Safety Program until 1986. The legislation authorising this program was last amended by The Dam Safety Act of 2006. Although some 79 people were killed by dam failures in 1979 at the Laurel Run Dam and at the Kelly Barnes Dam, it is likely that only a single death in the US has been caused by subsequent failures which was below the failed Spencer Dam. =Western Europe= The legislation varies on a country by county basis across Europe. Italy and Spain both have a minimum reservoir capacity of . France sets a minimum height of while Spain and Portugal and Austria all set a minimum height of but each with different volume minima.

Bio  Elise was born in Skowhegan, Maine, the only child of Frank and Deborah Swan Fellows. Her father played violin and was White's first violin teacher. When she was 10 years old, White and her mother moved to Boston so she could study at the New England Conservatory of Music with Timothee Adamowski, Campanari, Emery, L.C. Elson, and later Franz Kneisel. White continued her studies in Vienna with Kneisel's teacher Jacob Grun and with Max Lewinger. From 1897 to 1889 she attended Colby College, where she studied with Eugen Gruenberg. White gave several recitals in Vienna while she studied there. Her debut in Boston was with the Cecilia Society under conductor Benjamin Johnson Lang, and in New York at a Bagby Concert at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. White was a violinist in the New York Women's Symphony Orchestra. During 1895 and 1896, she toured and played violin in the northern United States and southern Canada with the McKenzie Tour Company trio consisting of soprano Rebecca McKenzie, pianist Bertha O'Reilly, and White.  Family  During this tour, White met her future husband, Bruce M. White, a mine owner and developer. They married in 1898 and had two sons: Bruce Jr. in 1900, and James in 1907. The family lived in British Columbia until Elise moved back to Skowhegan with the two boys around 1908. Bruce continued to support them financially until his death during the 1918 flu epidemic. After the boys grew up, White and her mother (her father had died) lived in various places in Maine - Skowhegan, Boston, Topsham, Brunswick, and Portland - until her mother's death in 1934.  Work  White supported herself by writing, playing violin, and teaching. In 1937, Schirmer Records recorded White playing seven pieces for violin and piano, accompanied by Carl Deis. She made additional recordings for Schirmer in 1942. While living in New York, White worked for the American Association of University Women as a hostess at their 1939 World's Fair booth, and wrote articles for the Skowhegan Independent Reporter about the Fair. She also wrote the chapter \\"History of Music in Old Bloomfield\\" in Louise Colburn's book, Skowhegan on the Kennebec, as well as articles for various publications, including Chicago Music News; Music Quarterly; Musical Observer; New Music Review; and Violin World.  Writing  Her articles include: *College Jazz and What it Symbolizes (Musical Observer) *Music Versus Materialism (Musical Quarterly 8; 1922) White's poems include: *Concert (Sonnet) *Fifth Symphony (Sonnet) *In Memoriam White encountered several well-known people during her life, including Johannes Brahms while studying in Vienna during the 1890s. She wrote in her diary about seeing Charles Lindbergh in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on July 25, 1927, only two months after his historic solo flight across the Atlantic. Artist Zaidee Lincoln Morrison, also a Skowhegan native, was one of White's closest friends. White corresponded with Australian composer Percy Grainger about American folk life and folk music. In 1938, White wrote her autobiography, about which she said, \\"Let the record be, therefore, not one of joys and sorrows, though they have been intense enough in my life, but let this narrative deal with the surroundings and scenery of the journey rather than with the mishaps and worries of the traveler. Let it be a story of privileges and of opportunities ‚Äì‚Äì not always made the most of, perhaps, but for which I am ever more grateful and more generously rewarded in a wealth of good memories.\\"  Musical Compositions  = Chamber (violin and piano or organ) = *Angelus (1912 *Bluebird (1914) *Etude Caprice (1922) *Fairy Tale *Fantasia Esplanada *Prelude in G (1923) = Vocal = *A Sigh *After Long Years *As Rivers Seek the Sea *For Remembrance (with violin obbligato; 1910) *In the Silence *Madrigal (soprano, contralto, 30 female voices, piano and violin; 1927) *My Love is Come *Out of the Night *Sargent Industrial School Song (text by anonymous) *Song of the Dawn (text by C.

The two panels were originally the left and right panels in the lower row on the inside of the right wing of the Salvation Mirror altar in St Leonard's collegiate church in Basel.

A Salvation Mirror altar was so called because it depicted scenes from the Speculum Humanae Salvationis (or Mirror of Human Salvation), an illustrated book of popular theology written in Latin in the Middle Ages. The St. Leonards altar was later dismantled and much of it lost. The pictures jointly portray a scene from a story in the Old Testament (2 Samuel 23:13-17). During a war with the Philistines, who were encamped at Bethlehem, King David, during a meeting with his chief warriors had exclaimed, ‚ÄúOh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!\\". Three of his best warriors (Abisai, Sibbechai and Benaja) stole through the Philistine positions, drew water from the well and carried it back to the king.

The nave is a Brick Gothic hall church construction with field stone dual towers that dominate the cityscape. The church was first mentioned in 1307 and likely consecrated in 1488. The Patron saint is St. Nicholas of Myra. The church contains a rare surviving indulgences coffer by Johann Tetzel. These practices were observed by Martin Luther in nearby Wittenberg who published his response 95 Theses.  Building  St. Nikolai church was first mentioned in 1307. The Brick Gothic hall church was constructed in three phases beginning with the nave. The northern and southern extensions were added to the nave in the early 15th century. The consecration of the church is believed to be in 1488 based on an inscription in the nave. Work on the towers was not completed until after 1500 and the final northern metal canopy was completed in 1617. The church is 71 meters long and 23 meters wide making it the largest in the region around J√ºterbog. The nave is three-aisled with five bays and a choir. The building is made of three different materials. The nave is predominantly made of red brick with some field stone patches. The vault ribs inside are made of sandstone. The nave is supported by attached buttresses on the outside and has a southern and a northern extension construction. St. Nikolai's overall construction resembles the Church of St. Mary in nearby Wittenberg. The two towers have five floors and are made of field stone with some more refined elements of sandstone. The upper floor is taller has larger windows. A platform connects both towers over an arched bridge. The northern tower spire is an octagon with a canopy and lantern in a Renaissance style and the southern tower spire has the shape of a pointed helmet. The main Gothic portal between the towers is carved from sandstone and holds a near life size statue of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of the church. Above the portal is a small Gothic rose window. The interior is characterized by lively decorations with a pulpit and arches that are both colorfully patterned. The church contains several stone epitaphs for local clergymen and dukes. The elevated high altar contains elaborate carvings with floral motifs and several colored putti. A central painting of Christ in the Jerusalem temple is flanked by two columns on each side. The top contains a triangle with the Hebrew spelling of the Tetragrammaton inside symbolizing the Christian trinity. The main church organ was built in 1909. The smaller positive organ from 1657 with five voices is the oldest surviving organ in the state of Brandenburg. The retable in the chapel contains a central panel painting showing the lamentation of Christ from about 1515-1520 that is attributed to the workshop of the German Renaissance painter Lucas Cranach the Elder. A soldier memorial is situated south of the main church building. It contains an elevated stone sarcophagus surrounded by a circle of columns with brick arches.

Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg had appointed Tetzel to collect indulgences which were used to finance the construction of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Martin Luther said in his table talks that Tetzel offered his letters of indulgence in J√ºterbog because he was not allowed to cross the border to nearby Wittenberg. When more and more of Luther's parishioners went to J√ºterbog to buy the latest indulgence letters, he published his famous 95 Theses in 1517 which began the Reformation. A local folklore story told by Theodor Fontane in his travelogue Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg said that the coffer was robbed from Tetzel by the local knight Hans von Hake who had previously bought an indulgence letter for future sins. Preacher and radical theologian Thomas M√ºntzer was a visiting preacher in St. Nikolai during Easter 1519. His radical ideas conflicted with both the Catholic church and Martin Luther. M√ºntzer participated in the German Peasants' War from 1524 and was executed after being captured. A memorial stone plague commemorates his preaching in St. Nikolai.

As a solo artist he has released two albums (Mike Oberst and His Five-String Banjo and Six Feet of Earth) and appeared as a guest on Jean Dowell's album, A Place Way Back in Time, which he produced. Additionally, The Tillers have released five studio albums and one concert album. They have performed internationally, including shows with Pokey LaFarge, Justin Townes Earle, Jerry Douglas, Iris Dement, Rev. Horton Heat, Doc Watson, Taj Mahal, Guy Clark, The Hackensaw Boys, Country Joe Mcdonald, Th' Legendary Shack Shakers, Dex Romweber, Rev. Peyton's Big Damn Band, The Dirt Daubers and more. Band member Joe Macheret has described their style as a mix of various American Folk styles with pieces of Bluegrass and bits of Jazz and Blues.  History  Mike Oberst was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he started taking piano lessons at the age of four. At 13, he learned a few guitar chords from his father and within a year he began performing with friends with whom he later formed local punk rock bands Disarm and The Resurgence. Oberst's musical interest shifted to folk music when he joined the Cincinnati Caledonian Bagpipe and Drum Corps from ages 17 to 22. At 23, he joined The Blue Rock Boys, an Irish Traditional Folk band, and began touring for the first time. Oberst went solo in 2007, performing locally and abroad. He became fascinated with the banjo and American folk music, especially in the style of Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, Pete Seeger and other Depression-era artists. During this period, Oberst met guitarist Sean Geil, who shared his musical interests. Together, they recruited Jason Soudrette and formed The Tillers, with Soudrette playing upright bass. In 2008, the band released its debut album, Ludlow Street Rag. The Tillers quickly became popular on the local and regional folk music scene, and enjoyed a sudden boost in popularity in 2009 when they appeared in the documentary American Character Along Highway 50 on the USA Network, with segments also airing on NBC's nightly newscasts. Hosted by NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw, the program explored the lives of people who live along U.S. Route 50, which stretches from Maryland to California. The Tillers appeared in the program because their song \\"There is a Road (Route 50)\\" was used in the soundtrack. Oberst's inspiration came from the iconic highway which passed through the neighborhood where he grew up in Cincinnati. Over the next three years, The Tillers toured almost nonstop but also found time to record and release three albums: By The Signs (2010), Wild Hog in the Woods (2011) and Farewell to the Historic Southgate House (2012). Their critically acclaimed Hand On The Plow was released in 2013, followed by their eponymous album The Tillers in 2018. While continuing to work with The Tillers, Oberst released his debut solo album Mike Oberst and His Five-String Banjo in 2011. Also, that year, he helped produce a benefit concert, \\"To Sing with You Once More,\\" to raise money and awareness to fight multiple myeloma cancer in memory of his late mother, who had died from the disease. The concert was also a memorial to Mike Seeger, Pete Seeger‚Äôs younger brother and one of Oberst's musical heroes, who also died from the disease. The concert featured folk musicians from all over the United States, including John Cohen and Tracy Schwarz, members of Mike Seeger's former band, The New Lost City Ramblers. Jason Soudrette left The Tillers in 2010 to further an already successful career in Sprint car racing. He was replaced by Aaron Geil, brother of the band's guitarist, Sean Geil. In 2013, Soudrette died from leukemia. In 2015, The Tillers added fiddler Joe Macheret. In 2013, Oberst co-founded a music festival in his hometown called \\"Sayler Park Sustains\\" to promote environmental and agricultural sustainability, with local environmental organizer Megan Ayers. He also co-founded Paper Street Farm, a nonprofit organic community garden. In 2016, Oberst produced and co-recorded A Place Way Back in Time, the debut album of Jean Dowell. Although Dowell was known primarily for her role in the development of female college athletics in the 1960s and 1970s, she had been writing songs since her childhood in North Carolina. When Oberst met her, he was so impressed with her songs that he encouraged her to begin performing live and let him produce her first album. In 2017, Oberst was cast in a supporting role in the independent film The Mountain Minor, playing an old-time fiddler and member of a fictional band called The Willie Abner Band, which was portrayed by The Tillers. The Mountain Minor won awards in several film festivals and was released in 2019. In 2019, Oberst released his second solo album, Six Feet of Earth, which earned international praise.

She left the crew of Farscape after six months, to focus on raising her daughter. Skopov began work on the 2006 film Novel Romance, which she directed and cowrote, shortly before her son was born. Political career Skopov sought the District 28 seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as a Democratic Party candidate in 2018. During her campaign, Skopov criticized incumbent legislator Mike Turzai for mounting several unsuccessful bids for higher electoral office. Turzai retained the seat, in the closest contest since he was first elected in 2001. In August 2019, Skopov began her second campaign for the state legislature. Turzai resigned his seat before the general election, and Skopov faced replacement Republican candidate Rob Mercuri.

The band also normally does \\"DIY\\" tours.  History  = Foundation and first album (2003-2014) = The band was formed in 2003 by high school friends who liked both punk and ska and wanted to play something different from what punk bands would do back then. The name was suggested by a friend and it follows a tendency observed by them in which ska bands would add the word \\"ska\\" to their names. Through a local label that also owned a store, the members could get to know bands such as NOFX, Pennywise, Bad Religion, No Fun at All, Millencolin, Goldfinger, Less Than Jake and Voodoo Glowskulls. Guitarist and vocalist Du believes the fact that Curitiba is a cold city with much more concrete than green areas makes the band sound less \\"beach-ish\\" than other ska punk acts. The members were able to produce the different sound they were looking for after they found some brass left by the school's marching band. After nine years, in which they released twelve songs in three different demo tapes and underwent several line-up changes, Abraskadabra released heir first album, Grandma Nancy's Old School Garden, in 2012, containing songs written during these nine first years. In the following year, they released their first video, \\"Sing 'til the End\\" and, in 2014, they toured the United States for the first time. = Welcome and international fame (2014-present) = In 2016, their cover of \\"Not Your Savior\\", by No Use for a Name, was featured on the documentary A Fat Wreck, about Fat Wreck Chords. In December 2017, they released a video for the song \\"Heavy Hitters\\", which would later be part of their second album, Welcome. The album was released on 20 February of the following year and it was recorded in 14 days in a rented house, with all production, recording, mixing, etc. handled by the members themselves. Soon after the release, they were mentioned by then Less Than Jake member Vinnie Fiorello as one of his favorite new ska punk acts. After Welcome's release and a second US tour, they hired a PR agency that alloed them to be covered by the international press and, consequently, they secured some other foreign tours, including one in the United Kingdom and another one in Japan.

It is one of the earliest Buddhist temples in western Japan, having been founded in the Asuka period. The temple is now a ruin and an archaeological site and has been designated by the national government as a National Historic Site since 1921. History The Shimotsuke Yakushi-ji was located on the right bank of the Kinugawa River. Worship of Yakushi Nyorai was introduced into Japan together with the introduction of Buddhism, and many of the earliest temples are dedicated to the \\"Buddha of Healing\\". The actual foundation date of the temple is uncertain. Per the Shoku Nihon K≈çki, in 684 AD, Emperor Shomu raised the chieftains of many local clans to the rank of ason, including several in what later became Shimotsuke Province. Later, in 687 AD, 689 AD, or 690 AD, he ordered that a large temple be constructed in the province with the assistance of missionaries and engineers from Silla in Korea. Per the Shoku Nihongi, the temple was of unprecedented scale, rivaling that of the great national temples which had been erected in Yamato Province, and in the Nara period, the temple was only one of three in the country (along with T≈çdai-ji and Kanzeon-ji) to have a kaidan (ordination platform), which was necessary to ordinate new priests. Roof tiles found during the 6th archaeological excavation of the temple ruins from 1966 to 1972 confirm that the temple dates from the reign of Emperor Tenmu, and that it occupied a rectangular compound 252 meters east- west by 340 meters north-south. The compound was surrounded by a moat and earthen rampart, and had gates in each of the cardinal directions. Within the compound were a Kond≈ç and Lecture Hall and Rectory in a straight line with the Pagoda and South Gate, with a cloister connecting the Middle Gate with the Kond≈ç, encircling the Pagoda and two smaller buildings. There was also another pagoda located outside the cloister. In 770 AD, the monk D≈çky≈ç attempted to seize power by seducing Empress K≈çken, but was deposed. He was sent in exile to the Shimotsuke Yakushi-ji, where he later died. The temple began its slow decline in the Heian period. With the rise of the Tendai sect on Mount Hiei with its own kaidan, and with the lack of a supporting sect of its own to provide followers, the Shimotsuke Yakushi-ji's role as primarily a seminary gradually diminished, although it retained the prestige of one of the highest ranking temples in eastern Japan through the end of the Heian period. Although receiving support from Minamoto no Yoritomo at the start of the Kamakura period as a Shingon sect temple, the growing popularity of Japanese Zen among the elites of the Kamakura and subsequent Muromachi period led to the further decline of the temple. In 1339, Ashikaga Takauji ordered that the temple change its name to \\"Ankoku-ji\\", with the intention that it would be one of the Ankoku-ji that he was building nationwide dedicated to the memory of the dead of the Genk≈ç War of 1333 and to enhance his control over the country. However, the temple continued to use the name \\"Yakushi-ji\\". The temple was destroyed in the Sengoku period in the wars between the Later H≈çj≈ç clan and the Y≈´ki clan. Two modern temples now exist on part of its ruins. The temple of in the southern part of ancient temple complex, on the ruins of its former Jiz≈ç-in, contains the grave of the monk D≈çky≈ç. A second temple, is located on the ruins of the Takashi-ji Fud≈ç-in and encompasses the ruins of the Shimotsuke Yakushi- ji kaidan.

It was published slightly earlier in the UK by Chatto & Windus under the title Popes: A History. It was introduced after Norwich had progressively built his reputation with more than twenty previous published titles and received significant notice in the press. Synopsis As indicated by its title, this is a history of the popes, from St. Peter to Pope Benedict. Although primarily factual, Norwich enlivens the historical record by sharing commentary and indicating motivations for the parties' decisions and actions. For example, in treating Charles Martel, Norwich asks if he would stop the advance of the Lombards and answers, \\"Perhaps, but he would not be hurried.\\" Accordingly, the reader is presented with the grand strategy and moral dilemmas of the times, providing a sense of the drama present in every age. Norwich comments that Gregory the Great (590 - 604) \\"was an administrator of genius, an organizer and a missionary; he was not and never could be, an abstract thinker or theologian, or even a politician.\\" Further he was, \\"[p]ious but practical, he intended the Patrimony of Peter to be a huge charitable fund, at the immediate disposal of the Church for the benefit of the poor ‚Äî every day twelve paupers shared his table.\\" Norwich also details the low points of the institution. In the mid nine-hundreds, the de facto ruler of Rome, and therefore the papacy, was the \\"ravishingly beautiful but sinister figure of Marozia, senatrix of Rome.\\" Pope John X, who showed signs of acting independently was, \\"struck down in the Lateran, before his brother's eyes\\" and later \\"deposed and imprisoned in the Castle Sant'Angelo, where he was soon afterward smothered to death with pillows.\\" Apparently Marozia hated him, which may \\"partly have been due to the fact that he had been her mother's lover.\\" Marozia used her power to have her grandson installed as Pope John XII. Far from conforming to our modern image of the pope as a frail, elderly man, this twenty-something gave female pilgrims to Rome quite a different sort of papal audience, by raping them. Roughly 200 years later, in 1159, the selection of a new pope was bitterly divided between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Cardinals. After the Cardinals had chosen Cardinal Roland, and at the point in the investiture ceremony where he bent his head to receive the \\"scarlet mantle of the papacy ... Octavian [an imperial-partisan Cardinal] dived at him, snatched the mantle, and tried to don it himself.\\" He lost it in a scuffle, but then, \\"his chaplain instantly produced another‚Äîpresumably brought along for just such an eventuality‚Äîwhich Octavian this time managed to put on, unfortunately back to front, before anyone could stop him.\\" After some further brouhaha, Octavian \\"made a dash for the papal throne, sat on it, and proclaimed himself Pope Victor IV.\\" Although the imperial forces present at the time in Rome helped him maintain his claim for some months, they had to head back to Germany in the autumn before the Alpine passes would be blocked by snow, spelling the end for Pope Victor IV. There is a chapter on Pope Joan, the woman who by legend, having kept her gender a secret was elected pope in 855, but became pregnant and gave delivery during a procession from St. Peter's to the Lateran, in a narrow lane. Norwich attributes this legend to a 1265 work by a \\"Dominican Monk named Martin\\" further stating that \\"[i]t is largely thanks to him that the legend of Pope Joan ... has become one of the hoariest canards in papal history.\\" He writes regarding earlier authors referencing of Pope Joan that \\"though their histories were written earlier, all of the surviving copies comfortably postdate Martin.\\" Noting that many references are mutually inconsistent, Norwich states \\"most of the rest echo Martin's words so closely as to leave no doubt that they are using him as their authority.\\" The author further notes a letter from Pope Leo IX (1049-1054) to the Byzantine Patriarch stating, \\"God forbid that we wish to believe [that] ... the Church of Constantinople ... once raised a woman onto the seat of its pontiff. We regard this crime as ... abominable and horrible ... .\\" Norwich then asks, \\"[h]ad Leo ever heard of the existence of Pope Joan, is it likely that he would have laid himself open to the patriarch's obvious retort?\\" Of Pope Innocent III (1198 - 1215) Norwich writes, \\"his complete confidence in himself ‚Äî together with a sense of humor rare in the middle ages ‚Äî made him patient, simple, and always approachable, genuinely loved by those around him.\\" Of Pope Alexander VI (1492-1503; AKA Rodrigo Borgia), Norwich asserts (also referencing son Cesare), \\"[t]hanks to the two of them, and in lesser measure [daughter] Lucrezia, the Borgias have become a legend for villainy and cruelty.\\" But there was another side. Speaking of the Church, Norwich asserts, \\"[t]o survive with its independence intact, it desperately needed adequate finance, firm administration, and astute diplomacy, and these Alexander was able to provide in full measure, however questionable his means of doing so.\\" The author further notes, \\"[m]any of the accusations leveled against him could have been easily disproved, had he bothered to do so; by leaving them unanswered, he contributed to his own unspeakable reputation.\\" Reception New York Times reviewer Bill Keller states of Norwich, \\"He keeps things moving at nearly beach-read pace by being selective about where he lingers and by adopting the tone of an enthusiastic tour guide, expert but less than reverent.\\" Los Angeles Times reviewer Janet Kinosian writes of Norwich, \\"with his unstuffy and sometimes witty writing style, he walks us through what could otherwise be a stifling couple of thousand years of popes, antipopes, endless political power struggles, war, greed, torture, inquisitions, egomania, incest, fornication, bastard children and orgies.\\" Publications * UK Hardcover: Norwich, John Julius; (1 March 2011).

Wise studied at the Royal College of Art under √âdouard Lant√©ri and created sculptures and medallions that were sold to members of the British royal family. Deaf from an early age, she overcame significant challenges to earn an education unusual for a woman at the time and build a career based on her artistic talent. Early life and education Dorothea Mary Stanton Wise was born October 20, 1879 in Dover, South East England. She was one of four children and her parents ran a boys' boarding school. Her parents discovered Dorothy was deaf when she was two years old. As a child Wise was primarily taught by her mother, but attended a hearing kindergarten to learn drawing and manners, where her artistic ability was made clear. When Wise was seventeen years old she moved with her parents to Hendon. Dorothy was sent to the College of the Deaf in Fitzroy Square every spring to improve her lipreading skills. When Wise decided she wanted to pursue sculpture as a profession, her family assisted her in learning the technical skills necessary to study at the Royal College of Art; her father taught artistic perspective, her mother developed studies in anatomical art, and her younger brother collaborated with her in geometric drawing. Wise earned a free scholarship at the Royal College of Art for three years. She studied at the college's sculpture studio under artist √âdouard Lant√©ri for five years. Her first exhibit at the academy was a large panel sculpture titled The Wings of the Morning, featuring the Greek goddess Demeter; when the purchaser arranged for the piece to be delivered, he was surprised that the sculptor was a woman. In 1906 she earned her sculpture degree, the only woman that year to earn that degree. Career and later life After leaving the college, Wise worked on commissions in multiple forms, including portraits and architectural drawings. One of her most popular statuettes was an electric light holder titled Spring. Wise was talented in sculpting busts of children as well as historical figures such as Joan of Arc. During World War I, when England was unable to import doll's heads from Germany, Wise modeled patterns of doll's heads for manufacturers. She also created medallions of notable people such as Catherine Isabella Dodd and Bishop John Prideaux. Her design for a memorial to Mrs. Henry Wood was selected by the Mayor of Worcester to be placed in Worcester Cathedral, but the lack of Greek marble due to the war caused delays in production. While she was waiting for large marble blocks to be available, she created smaller sculptures which were sold to dignitaries such as Queen Alexandra and Princess Victoria. Wise exhibited in at least ten shows, including seven times at the Manchester Art Gallery autumn exhibition. She was commissioned to create works for the 1911 Pageant of Empire at The Crystal Palace. Wise won gold medals at Manchester Art Gallery, the Royal Academy, and Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. She published several articles for the British Deaf Times between 1913 and 1916 sharing her accomplishments with the deaf community. She was also interviewed by deaf writer Yvonne Pitrois, saying she had lost out on some commissions when purchasers \\"had no time to waste for speaking to a deaf person\\". She continued to attend classes in life drawing and modeling design to keep her skills sharp. She died December 25, 1918 at her home in London, perhaps a victim of the 1918 flu epidemic.

He was the crown prince of Mewar until Hansa Bai, the Marwari princess was married to his father and their son Mokal Singh was declared as the next ruler of Mewar at the instance of Hansa's brother Ranmal. The Coat of arms of Sisodias. History Rao Chunda, who is considered as the progenitor of the Chundawat sub-clan of Rajputs was the eldest out of eight issues of Rao Lakha. In the last years of Lakha's reign, the ambitious Rathore prince of Marwar, Ranmal arrived to his court with the marriage proposal of his sister Hansa Bai to the \\"Maharana of Mewar\\". Ranmal had made several expeditions and had numerous victories in the nearby territories of Mewar. Rao Lakha, who was a greybeard then, jested with the delegation remarking the proposal was obviously not for him. Rao Chunda who was on a mission then was absent from the court. On his return Chunda came to know that the proposal was first brought for his father, hence he rejected the offer. Ranmal was a short tempered man and having a feel that rejection of Rathore princess could be considered as a sort of derogation by him forced Lakha, who was not in a favour to deteriorate the already strained relationship between Rathore and Sisodia clans to marry the young princess himself. Ranmal was not satisfied with this as he intended to control the Mewar through the nupital ties of his sister which he sought to make with the ruler of Mewar but old Lakha was soon to be retired and Rao Chunda was his heir apparent. This made Chunda to submit all his claims to the throne in the favour of the first child borne out of the union of his father Lakha Singh and the Marwari princess Hansa Bai.Original from the University of Michigan Chunda thus sacrificed his right to the throne and even helped his step brother and son of Hansa Bai, Rao Mokal to consolidate his hold over the kingdom, who ascended the throne as a \\"minor\\", after Lakha Singh was killed in a battle. During the later part of his life, he was defamed by the queen mother, Hansa Bai, who suspected him of plotting against her son Mokal Singh and sought submission of his rights as the regent. The period saw arrival of Ranmal Rathore, the maternal uncle of the minor ruler Mokal Singh and growing influence of Rathores over Sisodia Kingdom of Mewar, a fact which made many nobles of Mewar to resent and plot against Ranmal.Original from the University of Michigan Later part of life When Chunda was accused of plotting by Hansa Bai, he left the court and moved to Mandu, the capital of Malwa, and established himself here with his supporters who came to be known as Chundawat Rajputs. Meanwhile, in Mewar the atrocities of Ranmal, who assassinated Raghavdev, and another son of Lakha and made many women his captive, triggered a sentiment of hatred against him, which led to his murder. The grandson of Hansa Bai and Lakha Singh, Rana Kumbha ascended the throne after his murder and took the kingdom of Mewar to its zenith.

Camp's research focus lay in solid-state physics. He was particularly interested in the surface growth of ice.  Early life and education  He was born in Middletown, Connecticut to Professor Burton Howard Camp and Rachel Caroline Rice. His older sister, Miriam Camps (n√©e Camp), was a prominent writer and economist who for many years worked in the U.S. State Department. Upon his graduation from Wesleyan University in 1941, he joined a group of scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory, whose work centered on the development of radar. After the United States entered the Second World War, he was commissioned in the Navy while continuing his work at the laboratory. Camp received his M.A. in Physics from Harvard University in 1947 and received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Pennsylvania State University in 1951.  Career  Early in his career, Camp taught at Reed College and the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. In 1961, Camp departed Brooklyn Polytechnic to become Chief of the Materials Research Branch at the newly created U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in New Hampshire. While at USA CRREL, as the laboratory is known, Camp was engaged in substantial research regarding the physical properties of ice. In 1965 and 1966, during a leave of absence from CRREL, he served as a member of the Commission on College Physics (CCP), then headquartered at the University of Michigan. Created through a grant of the National Science Foundation in seeking to improve science education across the country, the 17-member CCP held numerous national conferences, issued many publications, and, most prominently, suggested various aids and revisions in the teaching of college physics. In 1967, Camp accepted a position at the University of Maine as both Professor and Chair of the Department of Physics. While Chair, he significantly expanded the University's focus on physics by insisting that specialists be hired in a wide variety of sub-fields within the subject. Camp is notable for having established the Ph.D. program in Physics at the University. He retired from the University of Maine in 1996 and later became a Distinguished Emeritus Professor at the University. Camp was a longtime member of the American Physical Society, American Association of Physics Teachers, and International Glaciological Society.  Personal life  Camp was married to Polly Ann Newton (born 1934), a Geneseo native and graduate of Wellesley College, with whom he had three daughters. Through his mother, Camp was a descendant of the English colonial settler Edmund Rice (1594‚Äì1663).

The statue is situated on Sewell Street, outside the Government Buildings known as Seddon House.  History  Richard Seddon, known as \\"King Dick\\", was born in England, and arrived in Hokitika in 1866, via Australia, to work the goldfields. After opening a store, Seddon then expanded his business to include the sale of alcohol and became a publican. His involvement with politics began with local boards, and then the local council, before becoming mayor of Kumara in 1874, and successfully running for Parliament in 1879. Seddon was Premier of New Zealand from 1893, and died in office in 1906. Two years later, the Seddon Memorial Committee in Hokitika proposed to the Hokitika Borough council to erect a statue in his honour. Funds of ¬£580 were raised through public subscription, and William Parkinson (of W. Parkinson & Co, Monumental Masons) of Auckland commissioned to produce the statue. Unusually for the time, the statue was produced in New Zealand, rather than overseas. Parkinson had previously, in 1902‚Äì03, designed and built the Hokitika Clock Tower to great public satisfaction. The Government Buildings then being designed by the Government Architect John Campbell were set back to allow room for the statue. On 25 May 1910, the statue was unveiled outside the Government Buildings in Hokitika. Thomas Joseph Mcguigan as chair of the memorial committee spoke first. The main speaker was Joseph Ward, the premier who had succeeded Seddon. Henry Michel, the mayor of Hokitika, spoke next and accepted the statue to be taken care of by Hokitika Borough. Tom Seddon, who had succeeded his father as representative of the Westland electorate, was the last speaker and, on behalf of his family, he thanked the people of Westland for their generosity of having fundraised for the statue. The inscription below the plinth reads: > Richard John Seddon / P.C. L.L.D / Represented Westland in Parliament > 1879‚Äì1906 / Prime Minister of New Zealand 1893‚Äì1906 Wreaths were laid on the thirtieth anniversary of Seddon's death.  Ownership  The Government Buildings and statue were both advertised for sale in 1993, which attracted national attention, and led to the continued public ownership of the statue. Despite a proposal to move the statue to another location in Hokitika in 1994, the statue remains in its original site. The statue was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I item in June 1990, with registration number 4995.  Significance  There are around six monuments erected to Seddon throughout New Zealand, but only two of them, this one, and the one by Sir Thomas Brock outside Parliament House, Wellington, resemble the man himself. According to the Historic Places Trust, the Hokitika statue is \\"a fine example of the realistic style of sculpture developed in Victorian times\\".

The main characters in her novels were women who felt fulfilled in marriage. Marholm was a New Woman feminist that wrote about feminist issues. Due to some of her beliefs, some other feminists did not consider Marholm to be among them. She believed that literature could be used to help gender relations. Some of Marholm's works were part of \\"feminist literary criticism\\" known as gynocriticism, 70 years before the term was coined, with much of that work being focused on Nordic women authors. Personal life Marholm was born Laura Mohr in 1854 in Riga, Latvia. Her mother was a German emigrant, and her father was a Danish sea captain. She received an education and was taught how to be a teacher. Marholm later taught Baltic history to other women. While using the pen name Leonhard Marholm, she wrote theatre reviews, articles, author biographies, and newspaper writings. Marholm became the first Latvian national playwright when she wrote her first play at 24 years old. She married the Swedish writer Ola Hansson, and they moved to Germany. She died in 1928 in Latvia. Works Marholm's book Wir Frauen and unsere Dichter (1895) examined works that were written by men to determine what was considered masculine about women. Six Modern Women: Psychological Sketches, a non-fiction book of biographies, was also published in 1895 and was translated into Swedish, Norwegian, English, Dutch, Russian, Polish, Czech, and Italian. Three of the women who were written about within the work were Anne Charlotte Edgren Leffler, Amalie Skram, and Sonja Kovalevsky. There was backlash against Six Modern Women because of traditional gender roles, with feedback that included \\"an absurd book\\" and \\"pathological eroto-mania\\". Marholm's book Studies in the Psychology of Woman (1897) was about multiple women from Scandinavia. Some of Marholm's works were part of \\"feminist literary criticism\\" known as gynocriticism, 70 years before the term was coined, with much of that work being focused on Nordic women authors. Marholm believed that literature could be used to improve gender relations. Marholm stated, \\"People used to talk about the role that the novel played in women's lives. It is time to reverse the issue. Let us now open our eyes to the role women's lives play in the novel.\\" In her novels, Marholm writes about human characteristics such as perversions and morbidities. It was Marholm's belief that \\"a woman's life begins and ends with man\\" and that \\"it is he who makes a woman of her\\". Marholm's female characters felt fulfilled in marriage. Marholm's work was often controversial, and she was referred to as anti-feminist by other feminists. Marholm's thoughts about women needing a man's love were believed to be against the political rights of women. Her works were often read by men as well as women who lacked an education. Despite the criticism, she was a New Woman feminist. Marholm also translated Scandinavian works into German.

In addition to its power output, the water rights the plant uses are among the oldest on the Colorado River, and play a major role in the flow of water to the Western Slope of Colorado. The Shoshone plant was constructed in the early 1900s, with its turbines installed in 1906 and power generation beginning in 1909. The plant has a maximum capacity of 15 MW from two 7.5 MW generators driven by two turbines, though typical power output is around 14 MW. Water to drive the turbines is drawn from the river at a dam about upstream of the powerplant, and carried through tunnels to penstocks above the station, after which it is returned to the river. Shoshone is owned and operated by Xcel Energy, and while its power output is comparatively small against most of the utility's generating stations, it is used to balance regional electricity needs. Shoshone holds water rights to per second of Colorado River water, which date back to 1902. This predates rights owned by entities on Colorado's Front Range, which draw water from where most of the state's precipitation falls on the Western Slope across the Continental Divide to major population centers east of the Rocky Mountains. By ensuring a consistent flow of water downstream on the river, Shoshone supports diverse sectors of the Western Slope economy, including river recreation, agriculture, and public utility use. The water rights have been largely preserved--in 2007, Xcel and Denver Water made a deal to reduce Shoshone's water rights to per second if warranted by low water levels during the spring snowmelt runoff season, prior to peak summer demand by recreation and agriculture. Otherwise, the original 1902 rights remained in effect, and were strengthened in 2016 when the Shoshone Outage Protocol was signed by a number of Colorado River stakeholders. The plan, an update to an addendum in a broader 2012 agreement, maintains the power plant's water rights even when electricity is not being generated--previously, when the plant was offline it yielded its water rights to claims that would otherwise hold lower priority.

E. Evans- Pritchard (1945), \\"The Sanusi of Cyrenaica\\", Africa 15(2): 61‚Äì79, esp. at 69. The negotiations that led to the modus vivendi were begun by Idrƒ´s al-San≈´sƒ´ soon after he succeeded his uncle at the head of the order in 1917. His cousin, A·∏•mad al-Sharƒ´f al-San≈´sƒ´, had instigated an unsuccessful war with Britain with Ottoman and German assistance at the height of the First World War. Idrƒ´s wished to enter into negotiations with Britain, but the British refused to negotiate unless their wartime ally, Italy, was included in the talks. Peace with Italy was more than al-Sharƒ´f could bear and he left Libya for the Ottoman Empire when negotiations were opened. The Italian and British delegations arrived in Tobruk in late January 1917, while Idrƒ´s stayed in Acroma. San≈´sƒ´ and British messengers conveyed the parties' written proposals between the two sites. Italian delegates first visited to Acroma in late March, on which occasion Idrƒ´s released an Italian prisoner-of-war as a sign of good will at the suggestion of the British.Rachel Simon (1987), Libya Between Ottomanism and Nationalism: The Ottoman Involvement in Libya during the War with Italy (1911‚Äì1919) (Berlin: Klaus Schwarz Verlag), pp. 287‚Äì289. There were four main documents that were the subject of negotiations: Italy's initial list of demands, Idrƒ´s's initial list of demands, an Italian revision to Idrƒ´s's list and Idrƒ´s's comments and revisions to his own original list. The Italians largely accepted Idrƒ´s's demands. The sticking point in negotiations was the Italians' request that he accept their demands in principle. The British backed Idrƒ´s on this point, and the issue was referred back to Tripoli (capital of Italian Libya) and Rome. When it was made explicit that acceptance in principle did not mean acceptance in detail and that further negotiations would be necessary before the implementation of any Italian demand, Idrƒ´s agreed to sign the modus vivendi on 14 April. Two separate agreements with the powers were signed on 16 April. The modus vivendi was a provisional set of agreements. It called for the San≈´siyya to cease hostilities and for the San≈´sƒ´ army to disband. Italy and the San≈´sƒ´ agreed to release all prisoners-of-war. The San≈´sƒ´ were to be permitted free trade with the coast and with Egypt, and Idrƒ´s's rule recognized in the oases of Awjila, Jalu, Ajdabiya, Jaghbub and Kufra. The San≈´sƒ´ institutes (zawƒÅyƒÅ) in Egypt, suppressed by the British, were to remain closed. Following the modus vivendi, Idrƒ´s arrested the Ottoman agents in his territory and placed pickets along the frontier between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania to prevent any from crossing into his territory. At Acroma, the San≈´sƒ´ repudiated Ottoman authority, but did not officially recognize Italian sovereignty. Idrƒ´s continued to deal directly with the British, despite Italian objections. In 1918, Italy and Britain even gave Idrƒ´s arms to help him maintain his control over the San≈´sƒ´. The modus vivendi was superseded by the accord of al-Rajima on 25 October 1920, by which Idrƒ´s accepted Italian sovereignty.

During operation of the planes, the looped ropes especially on the steep (long) plane, made from either hemp or iron chain, were subject to significant wear. In 1838 the Lehigh Company replaced this rope with an iron band one-twelfth of an inch thick but three inches wide. This improvement proved successful and the change was made to the other two inclined planes, which saved replacement and downtime costsLCNC Annual Report for 1839, Philadelphia:James Kay 1839, p. 31. The Room Run Gravity Railroad was replaced by the Nesquehoning Valley Railroad. A new main line was completed in April, 1870, and along with the Hauto Tunnel, (through the Nesquehoning Mountain) to coal yards in Lansford, Pennsylvania, and the rest of the Panther Creek Valley, was completed in 1872, as a joint-effort of the CNJ and Lehigh. CNJ operated the new railroad as a lease of the Lehigh Company.

It is notable for being the first known infaunal xenophyophore as well as for being a possible identity for the enigmatic trace fossil Paleodictyon.  Distribution and habitat  Like all other known xenophyophores, Occultammina is found in the deep ocean; the first known specimen was first discovered in 1980 at a depth of 8260 m in the Ogasawara Trench, off the coast of Japan and described in 1982 by a joint research team from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Tokyo. Further specimens referred to Occultammina sp. have been found at a depth of 4844 m in the Porcupine Abyssal Plain, in the North Atlantic. Further studies have expanded its geographical and bathymetric range from 3000 m and 8260 m in the Ogasawara Trench and from 4500 to 4800 m in the North Atlantic, and also recorded its presence at 6440 m in the Japan trench. Occultammina sp. has also been recovered at a depth of about 4050 metres near the Clipperton Fracture Zone, off the coast of western Mexico. Occultammina is infaunal; it typically is found at a depth of 6 cm or less below the sediment's surface. It was the first known infaunal xenophyophore. Occultammina is found at turbidite facies in today's oceans.  Description  Occultammina is an exceptionally large single-celled organism; like other xenophyophores it constructs a complex, single-chambered shell or \\"test\\" from sediment particles. It grows in a net- like shape, the test consisting of hollow tubes that branch or form loose polygons. It is typically flattened compared to other xenophyophores. It also has vertically ascending tubular outlets. Occultammina tubes are similar to those of Tendalia in general shape, though the test structure differs. The test wall typically ranges from 70-120Œºm in thickness; it is poorly cemented and consists of two layers. The outermost is 15-30Œºm in thickness and composed primarily from clay; the inner layer is 50-90Œºm thick and composed of silt and radiolarian tests. The interior of the test lining has between one and four ridges separating the stercomares, or waste masses. Individual Occultammina tubes are between 0.38 and 1 cm in diameter. Networks of Occultammina sized 5‚Äì10 cm across have been found at the Ogasawara trench. A specimen of Occultammina profunda was found to have unusually high levels of the radioactive isotopes Lead-210 (half-life=22.3 years), Polonium-210 (half- life=138.376 days) and Radium-226 (half-life=1600 years), specifically in the grannelare and stercomare, among the highest levels of Lead-210 recorded in any living organism. The authors suggest that the relative distribution of radionuclides in the organism's body parts implies that it grows and excretes comparatively rapidly. Unfortunately no DNA samples have been collected from Occultammina, preventing further examination of its evolutionary relationships.  Relation to Paleodictyon  The enigmatic fossil Paleodictyon has been likened to Occultammina The enigmatic \\"graphoglyptid\\" fossil Paleodictyon bears a passing resemblance to Occultammina, and this has led to suggestions of relationship between the two. Paleodictyon fossils are known from sediments interpreted as representing abyssal paleoenvironments associated with turbidite deposits, potentially lending credence to the hypothesis. Paleodictyon also preserves vertically ascending tubules that have been likened to those of Occultammina. However, this relationship has been contested. The large size (up to 0.5m) of some Paleodictyon is unknown in modern Occultammina; the regular hexagonal pattern of Paleodictyon is similarly not represented in Occultammina. The apparent absence of collected sediment particles (known as xenophyae) in graphoglyptid fossils further casts doubt on the possibility. Modern examples of Paleodictyon have been discovered; however, they have not been able to clear up the issue. These specimens come from near the mid-Atlantic Ridge at a depth of 3415‚Äì3585 meters. The specimens ranged from 2.4-7.5 cm in diameter. Dissection of one specimen did not reveal tubes, mucus, protoplasm, or evidence of a test. Staining of a second specimen did not reveal soft-bodied evidence for xenophyophores such as stercomares or granellae; some small agglutinated fragments were found that could have been from a psamminid, but this is not unexpected in deep-sea sediments. DNA analysis also did not reveal evidence of xenophyophores in the sample. The modern samples also lacked the barium concentation caused by the barite crystals in xenophyophore tests. This study suggested that Paleodictyon could represent a burrow system or a glass sponge.

In 1861, he founded the Continental Iron Works in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which built ironclad warships for the United States Navy during the American Civil War, most notably , which successfully neutralized the threat from the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia in the Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862. After the war, Rowland's Continental Works diversified into the construction of gasworks and other industrial fittings, and became a pioneer of welding technology, producing welded, corrugated boiler furnaces and other welded products. During the Spanish-American War and World War I, the company produced munitions. After World War I, it focused increasingly on the manufacture of gas mains and large-diameter water pipes. The plant closed in 1928, with the retirement of Rowland's eldest son from the business. Rowland was described as an energetic and inventive leader, who designed many of his own company's machine tools, accumulating more than fifty patents in the course of his lifetime. He also had an interest in philanthropy, and is credited among other things with having pioneered the Saturday half-day holiday in New York for employees. In 1884, he endowed the Thomas Fitch Rowland Prize for outstanding engineering papers, which is still awarded annually as of 2020.  Life and career  = Early life and career = Erecting the water pipeline across the Harlem River, ca. 1861, one of the first large contracts undertaken by the Continental Works Thomas Fitch Rowland was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on March 15, 1831, the fourth of five children and only son of George and Ruth Caroline (n√©e Attwater) Rowland. His mother died when he was six years old. Rowland was a descendant of Henry M. Rowland of Essex, England, an early settler of Fairfield, Connecticut, and of Thomas Fitch (1699‚Äì1774), one of the last colonial governors of the state,Transactions 1908. p. 1181. whose house was burned down by the British during the American Revolutionary War. Rowland received a common school education at Lovel's School and the Collegiate Preparatory School in New Haven. At the age of 13, he became the miller's boy in his father's grist mill. He eventually joined the New York and New Haven Railroad, reportedly as its first apprentice, later serving with the company as a fireman and engineer; he is said to have \\"fired the third passenger train that was sent over the road from New Haven to New York\\". In 1850, he took a position as 2nd assistant engineer on Connecticut, a leading steamboat operating between New Haven and New York. Discharged from this position following a change of ownership of the steamboat line, Rowland joined the Allaire Iron Works in 1852, where he worked as a draftsman. During his time with this company, he designed the engines of the steam revenue cutter . According to some sources, he then became general superintendent of the steam engineering works of Henry Esler & Co., but another account states that he joined the Morgan Iron Works. = Continental Iron Works = In 1859, Samuel Sneden, a builder of wood- hulled steamboats in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was offered a contract by a regular customer to build an iron-hulled ship. With no experience in the construction of such vessels, Sneden invited Rowland into partnership in his firm, Samuel Sneden & Co., to assist the yard in making the transition to iron shipbuilding.Weiss 1920. p. 368.Still 1988. p. 22. Rowland accepted, and over the following two years, three iron-hulled vessels were produced by the partnership.Roberts 2002. pp. 36‚Äì37. In January 1861, however, Sneden & Co. abruptly failed after submitting a low bid for the construction of a large- diameter water mains across the Harlem River. Shortly after, Sneden ceded his yard to Rowland, who pledged to settle the failed company's affairs. Rowland renamed the yard the Continental Iron Works,Transactions 1908. p. 1182. and the water mains contract would later be completed by the new firm.  American Civil War  Launch of at the Continental Iron Works, January 30, 1862 The establishment of the Continental Works coincided with the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, and later that year, Rowland became associated with New York engineer John Ericsson, who had just secured a contract with the United States Navy for the construction of a radically new type of ironclad warship with low freeboard and a revolving gun turret.Still 1988. pp. 24‚Äì26. Ericsson subcontracted Rowland for construction of the hull, and the new warship, known as , was launched at the Continental Works in just 101 days. When Monitor successfully neutralized the threat from the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia at the Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862, a \\"monitor craze\\" took hold in Washington, with contracts for many more such warships being issued to firms around the nation.Still 1988. p. 26. The Continental Iron Works would ultimately build seven monitors for the Navy during the war--more than any other company in the country. The Works also built the turrets for an additional three monitors as well as building an iron-hulled gunboatStill 1988. p. 29. and doing other wartime work for the government.Still 1988. p. 23. At one point in 1864, Rowland attempted to sell the Continental Works and go into early retirement, but this did not eventuate, and instead he would remain the company's president for most of his life. During the war, Rowland was widely praised for his energetic and creative leadership.Still 1988. p. 28. He patented a number of machine tools in this period, including one that reportedly saved the labor of 75 men. A \\"prolific\\" inventor, Rowland would file more than fifty patents over the course of his lifetime.  Postwar activities  After the Civil War, a severe and prolonged shipbuilding slump devastated New York's shipbuilding industry,Still 1988. p. 31. and although the Continental Iron Works continued to build the occasional ship, it diversified into other areas, notably the supply of equipment for the burgeoning gas lighting industry, including the manufacture of gas holders, gas mains and entire gasworks.Still 1988. p. 32. The company also manufactured its own line of boilers, and became a pioneer in welding technology, producing welded boiler furnaces, gas-illuminated buoys, steel digesters for the wood-pulping industry, and other products. From time to time it also manufactured munitions, notably welded torpedo casings, and depth charge casings during World War I. After this war, the company increasingly focused on the manufacture of gas mains and large welded water pipes. The company was liquidated in 1928, following the retirement of Rowland's son. = Personal details = Rowland, ca. 1903 In 1855, Thomas F. Rowland married Mary Eliza Bradley, daughter of Charles Bradley of New Haven, Connecticut.Transactions 1908. p. 1183. The Rowlands had four children: a daughter, Caroline Attwater, who died in infancy, and three sons, Thomas Jr., Charles and George,Hooker 1909. p. 30. the first two of whom mentioned following their father into the family business.Weiss 1920. p. 369. Rowland was known for his genial disposition, and was said to be \\"universally esteemed\\" during his life; he was further described as a \\"leading and progressive spirit in the life of the Greenpoint community.\\" He was active as a philanthropist, notably pioneering the practice in New York of granting a half-day holiday to employees on Saturday afternoons, which he extended to his own workforce with no reduction in pay. He also gave generous Christmas bonuses to his employees, ranging from $25 () to $75 () depending on their length of employment. After the Ascension Episcopal Church in Kent Street, Brooklyn, was completed in 1885, Rowland paid the Church's outstanding debt of $15,000 (). On another occasion, when the rector of the Church--whom Rowland had at the time known for only a few months--suffered a prolonged illness, Rowland paid his accumulated medical bills. Rowland was a vice-president and life member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and was one of only nine honorary members in his time of the American Society of Civil Engineers. To the latter organization he endowed an annual prize for exceptional engineering papers, known as the Thomas Fitch Rowland Prize, which is still awarded today. He was a life member of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, the New York Chamber of Commerce, the American Geographical Society, American Gas Light Association, New Haven Colony Historical Society, Fairfield County Historical Society and New England Society, and an honorary member of the Society of Gas Lighting, Union League Club and American Yacht Club. He was also a trustee of the Webb Academy and Home for Shipbuilders, the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen and the New York Historical Society.Transactions 1908. pp. 1183‚Äì1184. Rowland struggled with illness in his declining years. He died on December 13, 1907, having only stepped back from the presidency of the Continental Works a few months prior. He was survived by his wife Mary, and by two of his sons, Thomas Jr. and Charles. His remains were interred in the family plot in Evergreen Cemetery, in his birthplace of New Haven, Connecticut.

As the son of an artist, he naturally became interested in painting at an early age and began studying with his father. Then he attended the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos de Valencia. In 1895, when he was only sixteen, he entered his first work in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts and received honorable mention. He also won a silver medal at the Exposition Universelle (1900). Later, he moved to Madrid to pursue his career. In 1906, he spent his time traveling between Paris, London and Rome. The following year, he married Magdalena Mitjans, from a old and once noble family. They would have two daughters.

In 1915, Pinazo was awarded a First Class prize at the National Exhibition for his large canvas \\"Floreal\\", for which Magdalena served as a model and helped select the costumes. He participated in several international exhibitions; notably in Panama and St. Louis. In 1920, he visited the United States, but had little success until Magdalena was able to arrange a showing in New York at the Gimpel and Wildenstein gallery. The following year, he made an extended visit to Cuba, for a showing at the Sal√≥n de Bellas Artes de La Habana, after which he received several commissions. In 1925, he made some significant changes in his style and held his last solo exhibition in Madrid, preferring to focus on foreign buyers; primarily in Buenos Aires. He received a major commission from Archer Milton Huntington, for the Hispanic Society of America, in 1929. Small showings followed at the Carnegie Institute (1930) and the Art Institute of Chicago (1931).

It was released digitally on September 6, 2020, through the music publishing platform Bandcamp and is his first EP, as well as his first album- type release since 2015's In Another Life. Produced by Bilal with HighBreedMusic owner Tariq Khan, VOYAGE-19 was recorded over the course of three days in August 2020 with 30 other musicians, including fellow singer- songwriter Erykah Badu, the pianist Robert Glasper, the saxophonist Marcus Strickland, the harpist Brandee Younger, and the drummer Marcus Gilmore. Its recording sessions, spanning 54 hours, were conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and streamed live on YouTube. The cover art was designed by the visual artist Angelbert Metoyer. A musically experimental work, VOYAGE-19 reflects contemporary societal concerns in its themes. With many of the contributing musicians struggling financially because of the pandemic, they received revenues from the EP as well as any direct donations that accompanied its sale.  Recording and production  VOYAGE-19 is Bilal's first recorded release since his guest appearances in late 2019 on the Queen & Slim soundtrack and the pianist Robert Glasper's mixtape Fuck Yo Feelings. It is also his first album-type release in five years, following his fifth album In Another Life (2015). Ben Williams, among the EP's many contributing musicians Bilal wrote and recorded the EP over the course of a three-day weekend from August 7 to August 9, 2020, in partnership with HighBreedMusic, a Brooklyn-based recording studio, production company, and digital music channel. He produced alongside HighBreedMusic owner Tariq Khan, known for his collaborations with the singer-songwriters Erykah Badu and FKA Twigs. Bilal conceived one song on each day of the EP's experimental sessions, which totaled 54 hours. He used a combination of the studio's technologies to interact and collaborate with 30 other musicians, who each created musical parts remotely from their home due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. Participating musicians included Glasper, Badu, the vocalists Melanie Charles and Madison McFerrin, the spoken-word poet Khemist, the bassists Tone Whitfield and Ben Williams, the trumpeter Keyon Harrold, the saxophonist Marcus Strickland, the keyboardists Raymond Angry and Simon Mavin (of Hiatus Kaiyote), the harpist Brandee Younger, and the drummer Marcus Gilmore. A number of musicians were longtime collaborators and friends of Bilal, as well as associates of HighBreedMusic.  Music and lyrics  The EP is described by Cool Hunting editor Katie Olsen as an experimental work. According to WXPN journalist John Vettese, each song \\"represents a step along the journey through a very strange year\\", demonstrated most vividly on the EP's final track, \\"Voyage to a New World\\". Opening with the sound of a bird song and Badu's poetry (\\"Wake up / You see that ship ahead? / Just walk, don't run\\"), \\"Voyage to a New World\\" is described by Olsen as \\"a kind of meditation before taking various twists and turns\\", as \\"distorted vocals and chaotic percussion lead to a lush, soulful flute-laden melody that soon morphs again.\\" In Vettese's observations, the \\"experimentally structured piece\\" begins with \\"a space music synth tapestry, and switches moods with a bass drop to a series of different tones and textures, ultimately landing on a surreal groove reminiscent of Radiohead and Sun Ra, and guided by Melanie Charles' flute, BigYuki and Glasper's keyboards, and a choir of voices featuring Madison McFerrin, YahZarah, and Bilal himself.\\" Erykah Badu in 2019 The lyrics of \\"Voyage to a New World\\" depict \\"a crowd of people, troubled and in motion ‚Äì there are differences among their backgrounds, differences in their response to their collective experience, but they are moving in the same direction\\", interprets Vettese. He concludes that the song's narrator sees this \\"through a Marvin Gaye-esque lens of cautious optimism\\" in the final verse.  Marketing  The EP's sessions were streamed live in their entirety on YouTube. The broadcast simultaneously showed its artwork being made, with a group of three visual artists enlisted during each song's making, including Angelbert Metoyer and Shanina Dionna. According to SoulBounce writer Briana Cakes, this virtual event was a \\"history-making affair\\". The EP was sold exclusively through the music publishing platform Bandcamp (logo pictured). VOYAGE-19 was originally available to be pre-ordered during the weekend of the broadcast. Proceeds from the sale of the pre-order were given to the participating artists, a number of whom were struggling financially because of the pandemic. Consumers were also given the option of making donations directly. On September 6, 2020, the three-track EP was released on the music publishing platform Bandcamp as a digital download, at a price of $6.99. The profits from this sale were also distributed among the musicians.

After his would-be fifth and sixth victim survived, he was detained, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is serving at the Polar Owl Colony. Early life Little is known about Aituganov's early life. Born in the Tajik SSR, he was described as a \\"loser\\" in his social life and academic achievements, failing in finding a girlfriend or completing his education. Desperate to find employment, he moved to Russia illegally in early 2011, settling in Yekaterinburg. However, his lack of skills and inability to speak the language resulted in him being denied numerous jobs, with him eventually settling to work as a security guard at a parking lot. This was done off the books, as it didn't require the use of official documents. Despite his newfound employment, problems at work, with money and adapting to the big city life greatly impacted Firuz, who decided that he would solve all of them with violence. Murders On March 27, 2010, Aituganov noticed 32-year-old Marina Alexandrovna walking down the street, returning to her apartment after visiting some friends in the city. He began stalking her, eventually subduing her and dragging her to a nearby abandoned building, where he proceeded to rape and strangle her. After killing Marina, he rummaged through her corpse, stealing all her money and valuables. A few days later, Alexandrovna's body was located, with no clue to whom had killed her. In the following three months, three other women were killed in a similar fashion in the Leninsky City and Chkalovsky Districts: all had been stalked, raped and murdered in isolated areas of the city, with the apparent motive being robbery. Like Alexandrovna, the second and third victim had been strangled, but the fourth had been killed with a brick. By this time, rumors of a serial offender were spreading panic among the residents, and law enforcement began looking for a suspect. Not long after, two more women would be attacked, but they managed to evade death. The first victim, although she was raped and robbed, managed to flee, leaving behind her handbag with an expensive mobile phone and 15,000 rubles in it. Aituganov hid for a couple days, but then attacked again, unsuccessfully trying to rape another woman, who managed to fight him off, losing her cellphone in the process. Thanks to her witness statements, the authorities soon arrested him. Trial and imprisonment After his capture, Firuz's DNA was examined, connecting him to the four murders and the two attacks. He was brought to trial with these charges, and was supposed to be charged with three additional rapes, but since there wasn't enough evidence, those were dropped. At trial, Aituganov was given an interpreter whom translated to him in Tajik, since he couldn't speak Russian. On June 1, 2011, he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment, and upon hearing the verdict, Aituganov burst into tears. He was sent off the Polar Owl Colony to serve his sentence. All of his subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Russia were promptly shot down, and he remains incarcerated to this day.

It was released in July 1998, through PolyGram. Primarily a dance record, the album features contributions from writers and producers Joo Young-hoon, Jae Chong of Solid, and Park Jin-young. Invitation continued to establish Uhm's image as a fashion icon. The album produced a string of hit singles: \\"Poison\\", \\"Invitation\\" and \\"Finding Hidden Image\\". The former two became signature songs for Uhm; in early-2015, they reappeared on the Gaon Digital Chart at number one and number nineteen, respectively. Invitation was a commercially successful release, recording 180,000 copies in its first month of sales. It eventually moved more than 450,000 copies. The album was supported by Uhm's debut live concert, titled Temptation of a Thousand Years, in November 1998.  Background and development  Uhm recruited songwriter Joo Young-hoon to work on the release, following the unexpected success \\"Betrayal of Rose\\" from her previous studio album, After Love, for which he wrote and compose. Joo contributed two songs to Invitation: \\"Poison\\" and \\"Working Girl\\". Uhm initially hated \\"Poison\\" and complained about its trot influence, crying throughout its production; but nevertheless she \\"bit the bullet\\" and released it as the album's lead single, greatly exceeding expectations. Singer and producer Park Jin-young, now better known as the founder of JYP Entertainment, wrote the album's title track, \\"Invitation\\", following a drinking party between the two. In 2019, Park remarked: \\"It was created by making use of all the feelings. It was made only for Uhm Jung-hwa.\\"  Singles and promotion  The album's lead single, \\"Poison\\", is an electronic dance track influenced by techno and hip-hop, with a music video that featured actor Cha Seung-won when he first worked as a fashion model. The album's second single and title track, \\"Chodae\\", is backed by a disco rhythm while its lyrics express a fascination with the opposite sex. Uhm Jung-hwa performed her debut live concert, Temptation of a Thousand Years, on November 28 and 29, 1998, at the Education and Culture Center in Yangjae-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, with two concerts on both days. The concert was themed as to declare a \\"transformation\\" from \\"an innocent girl to a mature woman\\", with Uhm's intent to create a \\"dramatic\\" stage with a storyline‚Äîsimilar to productions by American singers Madonna and Michael Jackson. Kim Gap-sik of DongA commented that she resembled the Roman god Janus, in that Uhm showcased both a \\"seemingly subtle sexy look\\" and a barefaced \\"girl next door\\" persona over its duration. The concert was especially notable for showing the uncut \\"Invitation\\" music video with Uhm's upper body nudity scenes. Cable channel Catch One broadcast the concert on November 30, 1998, and it was later released on VCD.  Legacy  Uhm's presentation during this era was compared to that of British actress Audrey Hepburn. Invitation continued the stylistic transformations first exhibited by Uhm on her breakthrough single, \\"Rose of Betrayal\\". The album cover for Invitation positions Uhm against a red backdrop, peering through green foliage and sporting a straight, middle-part bob. Uhm maintained the hairstyle during promotions for \\"Poison\\", which became a trend among Korean women, prompting cosmetologists across the country to study \\"how to cut short hair well\\". Esquire Korea fashion editor Shim Jeong-hee remarked that Uhm cultivated a \\"luxurious yet youthful\\" atmosphere reminiscent of the \\"Hepburn look\\". In contrast, an \\"alluring and mysterious\\" image was introduced for the album's second single, \\"Chodae\\", in which Uhm wore her hair long, and performed with a hand fan in black dresses. Kim Ji-soo of Allure Korea came to a similar conclusion, singling out \\"Chodae\\" for its \\"understated [sexiness]\\" and \\"Poison\\" for its more \\"charismatic\\" look as two key reinventions in Uhm's career. In a retrospective article, American music magazine Billboard placed \\"Chodae\\" at number 49 in its list of the \\"98 Greatest Songs of 1998\\". \\"Chodae\\" is frequently covered, with notable performances by soloists Ivy, Ga-in, Sunmi, Tiffany Young, actress Lee Sung-kyung, and Park Jin-young himself. The 2014 single \\"Something\\" by girl group Girl's Day took influence from both \\"Chodae\\" and the similarly JYP-penned \\"Coming of Age Ceremony\\" by Park Ji- yoon. In 2019, \\"Chodae\\" was covered and reworked by rapper Miryo, a member of the girl group Brown Eyed Girls, on their seventh studio album Revive. Miryo's version features Uhm Jung-hwa herself. A short sample of \\"Poison\\" appears at the end of American rock band Rage Against the Machine's 1999 single \\"Sleep Now in the Fire\\", after it was picked up from a local Korean radio station broadcast by the amplifier of their guitarist, Tom Morello. In 2018, appearing on KBS 2TV's Entertainment Weekly, Uhm picked \\"Poison\\" as one of her top seven songs, at second place. She stated that this brief period, starting with \\"Poison\\" and ending with 1999's \\"Molla\\", were the singles that earned her the most revenue, joking that she stopped receiving any income from her music after that.

Between 1884-1919, it was known as the Irkutsk Military District. History The East Siberian Military District was originally formed as a military district of the Russian Empire in 1864. It included the territories of the Irkutsk and Yenisei provinces, and Amur, Transbaikal, Primorsk and Yakutsk regions. On July 14, 1884, it was divided into two separate military districts : the Irkutsk Military District and the Amur Military District, which existed until 1919, when the Red Army conquered Siberia. After the arrival of the Red Army, a new East Siberian Military District of the Red Army was formed on March 15, 1920 on the territory that included the Tomsk, Yenisei, Irkutsk provinces and the Yakutsk region. In January 1923, the district was abolished. The territory and troops were transferred to the Siberian Military District. On July 9, 1945, the East Siberian Military District was created for the third time, as part of the Irkutsk Region, Krasnoyarsk Territory, the Yakutsk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Tuva Autonomous District.

Political crisis broke out in Bulgaria (1996 ‚Äì 1997) erupted in January and February. At the beginning of 1997, Bulgaria fell into a deep political and financial crisis. It is the result of a number of previous objective reasons and external interventions.  Background  In 1989, Bulgaria was part of the process of change in the countries of Eastern Europe, also called Revolutions of 1989. In 1991, Bulgaria adopted a democratic constitution, also popularly known as the Lukanov Constitution. There is serious opposition to this constitution, including a hunger strike by 39 deputies from the Grand National Assembly of Bulgaria. The Epic of the Hungry (in Bulgarian) At the end of 1992, after a vote of confidence, the first democratic and anti-totalitarian government with Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov was overthrown. 1992 - Filip Dimitrov - Prime Minister with a little, but forever (in Bulgarian) He was replaced in 1993 by a government in collusion with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and a mandate from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. In Bulgaria, wholesale crime is rampant with political protections and racketeering against medium and small enterprises and initiatives. As a result of this political process, after early parliamentary elections, in 1995 the government of the Bulgarian Socialist Party came to power with Prime Minister Jean Videnov. Jean Videnov spoke after 10 years (in Bulgarian) Jean Videnov's government, although initially enjoying an absolute party majority in parliament, appears to be incompetent, inadequate and made up of political cabinets and surrounded by political advisers in sharp conflicts of interest. The prime minister is non- consensual, uncompromising and possessed of a utopian ideology that denies any social and economic reforms. On the other hand, in terms of foreign policy and foreign trade, by the 1990s Bulgaria was historically, economically and culturally still mostly tied to Russia, which was experiencing serious difficulties at the time and reached the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Against the background of the Yugoslav Wars. George Soros and financial speculators like him took advantage of the situation in Bulgaria in 1996. American financiers and native politicians are conducting money scandals (in Bulgarian)  Incident  In January 1997, under conditions of brief and speculative hyperinflation, the Bulgarian Parliament was surrounded by protesters, shattered and looted. The events of 10 January 1997 and the return of the mandate to form a government on 4 February 1997. (in Bulgarian) The government resigned, and newly elected President Petar Stoyanov refused to give a mandate for a new government to the Bulgarian Socialist Party, and after early parliamentary elections in the spring of 1997, Ivan Kostov's reformist government came to power.

The Chairman of the Bulgarian National Bank: The currency board and the fixed exchange rate of the lev to the euro will not be touched. (in Bulgarian)  Consequences  As a result of the political processes in the 1990s, Bulgaria lost 2 million people in 35 years and by 2020 became the poorest and most corrupt country in the European Union. The currency board imposed on the country by the International Monetary Fund remains in force until 2020, and the National Audit Office of Bulgaria does not restore its judicial function and in the country deprived of monetary policy until 2020 Bulgarian protests.

It was envisaged that sales of gas would double by 1970/71 and double again by 1973.Hansard, House of Commons 2 May 1968 Both the gas and electricity industries had expressed an interest in borrowing capital in foreign currency markets. The expanded functions of the Gas Council had made it desirable for the Council membership to be increased. The Gas and Electricity Act 1968 addressed these issues and provided the necessary legal powers.  Gas and Electricity Act 1968  The Gas and Electricity Act 1968 (1968 c. 39) received Royal Assent on 3 July 1968. Its long title is: ‚ÄòAn Act to increase the statutory limits on the amounts outstanding in respect to borrowings by the Gas Council and Area Gas Boards; to provide for the borrowing by the Electricity Council, the Scottish Electricity Boards and the Gas Council of money in foreign currency; to enable the said Councils and Boards and other electricity authorities to furnish overseas aid; to increase the number of members of the Gas Council; and for connected purposes.‚Äô = Provisions = The provisions of the Act comprise 8 Sections * Section 1 extended the borrowing powers of Gas Council and Area Gas Boards to ¬£1,600 million or a greater sum not exceeding ¬£2,400, as sanctioned by the Minister. The Gas (Borrowing Powers) Act 1965 ceased to have effect, * Section 2 Empowered the Electricity Council to borrow foreign currency by the issue of securities * Section 3 Empowered the Scottish Electricity Boards to borrow foreign currency by the issue of securities * Section 4 Empowered the Gas Council to borrow foreign currency by the issue of securities * Section 5 Permitted the furnishing of foreign aid by the Electricity Council, the Central Electricity Board, an Area Electricity Board, the Gas Council, and an Area Gas Board. * Section 6 Empowered the Minister to appoint two further members to the Gas Council * Section 7 Interpretation * Section 8 Short title  Consequences and later enactments  As a consequence of Section 1(3)(a) of the 1968 Act the Gas (Borrowing Powers) Act 1965 ceased to have effect. In 1969 the Electricity Council and the South of Scotland Electricity Board floated loans on the German market. Sections 1, 4 and 6 of the 1968 Act were repealed by the Gas Act 1972.

It has existed for at least 60,000 years, and went extinct around 850-600 BC. The type species and only known species, T. burleyi, was named in 2020 based on subfossil remains. Description Tongoenas was found in a cave, only known from subfossil remains, and was thought to have been killed and eaten by early human settlers on the Pacific Islands. It is known from Foa, Lifuka, \`Uiha, Ha\`afeva, Tongatapu, and \`Eua. The scientists exploring the islands noticed that the trees on the island were larger than expected, with big fleshy fruits dangling from the branches. Lead author David W. Steadman said this: He continued; Tongoenas was able to swallow fruits as large as a tennis ball. It was considered osteologically comparable to Ducula, Gymnophaps, and Hemiphaga Paleoecology Tongoenas had the ability to take flight, and lived high in the canopies, and is the largest known volant columbid aside from living Goura species.Tongoenas went extinct after the arrival of humans on the Pacific Islands. Since Tongoenas co-evolved with guava, mango and the chinaberry lineages, Tongoenas served as a crucial seed disperser, alongside an extinct Ducula species, Ducula shutleri. Extinction Since Tongoenas was eaten by the humans who settled on 'Eua, it is likely that Tongoenas was hunted to extinction by humans. It went extinct around 850-600 BC.

The term taphonomy from palaeontology applies to the fate of all kinds of remains of organisms, with forensic taphonomy concerned for remains of the human body. Clinical signs and stages of death Signs of death or strong indications that a warm-blooded animal is no longer alive are: * Respiratory arrest (no breathing) * Cardiac arrest (no pulse) * Brain death (no neuronal activity). Until the middle of the 20th century, the definition of and criteria for death, medically speaking, could be put concisely: > Sufficient destruction of the brain, including the brainstem, ensured > respiratory failure leading quickly to terminal cardiac arrest. Conversely, > prolonged cardiopulmonary failure inevitably led to total, irreversible loss > of brain function. Developments in ventilator technology from about 1950 lessened the necessary consequences of respiratory arrest. The definition of legal death, and its formal documentation in a death certificate, vary according to the jurisdiction. The certification applies to somatic death, corresponding to death of the person, which has varying definitions. Death at the level of cells, called molecular death, follows a matter of hours later. These distinctions, and the independence of physicians certifying legal death, are significant in organ procurement. Post-mortem changes The stages that follow shortly after death are: * , paleness which happens in the 15‚Äì120 minutes after death * , the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature * , the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin rigor) and difficult to move or manipulate * , or dependent lividity, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body * Putrefaction, the beginning signs of decomposition Of these, with obvious mortal damage to the body, the textbook conclusive signs of death clear to a lay person are: rigor mortis, livor mortis, and putrefaction. The cardinal signs of death may refer to the ending of breathing, heartbeat and circulation, or to algor mortis, livor mortis and rigor mortis; the adoption of brain death as a definition has lessened the centrality of these signs. In a clearer contemporary terminology, algor mortis, livor mortis and rigor mortis are called \\"early postmortem\\" changes, in distinction from the \\"immediate postmortem\\" changes associated with the cessation of bodily functions, as indicated by vital signs. With an ophthalmoscope, changes to the blood in the retina are quickly visible. Those stages are followed, in taphonomy, by * Decomposition, the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor. * Skeletonization, the end of decomposition, where all soft tissues have decomposed, leaving only the skeleton. * Fossilization, the natural preservation of the skeletal remains formed over a very long period. This stage may not occur, depending on the circumstances and the conditions of the surrounding environment. =Decomposition stages= Descriptions of decomposition may refer to a five-stage process: * Stage 1: Initial decay: Bacteria located mainly in the lower intestine begin decomposition, giving a greenish color to the lower abdomen. * Stage 2: Putrefaction: Bacteria grow throughout the body, releasing gases, including cadaverine, which in turn bloat the body and cause an unpleasant odor. * Stage 3: Black putrefaction: This stage brings further discoloration to the body. The gases from bacterial decay begin to escape, causing a strong odor. * Stage 4: Butyric fermentation: The internal organs liquefy and the body begins to dry out. * Stage 5: Mummification: This is the slowest of the five stages. In a hot, dry climate the body may dehydrate, inhibiting bacterial decay; the skin dries to a dark leathery appearance.

When he debuted for New Zealand in 1925 he became Kiwi number 171. He predominantly played fullback during his career though he played standoff and centre at various points. He also represented Auckland in both rugby league and rugby union and played for the Ponsonby rugby club and the Marist rugby league club. Early life Charles Edward Gregory was born on 2 July 1901. He was the son of mother Johanna Drysdale Gregory, and father William John Gregory. He is believed to have had three older brothers, Thomas (b.1891), William James (b.1895) and George Robert (b.1896), and a younger brother Albert John (b.1904). He also had older sisters, Rose (b.1893), and Annie (b.1887). Playing career =Rugby union, Ponsonby and Auckland= Charles Gregory began playing rugby for the Ponsonby club in Auckland. He played for the 2nd grade team from 1919 to 1921. During the 1921 season he was selected in the Auckland junior representative team to play Thames juniors in the five-eighths position. The match was played at Eden Park with Gregory kicking a conversion in a 26-0 win. He then played for them in a 10-6 win against the Manukau sub-union senior representative side as curtain-raiser to the Auckland-Wellington match. His last game for them was against Whangarei B in Whangarei with Auckland winning 25-3. In 1922 he began the season in the Ponsonby juniors for the first round but was then promoted to the first grade side for their 6 May match with Grafton. They won 11-3 on the number 1 field at Eden Park. His first points for them were in a 31-3 win in front of 4,000 spectators. He kicked 5 conversions and a penalty. He then scored 2 tries and kicked 2 goals in a 17-8 win over North Shore. In July Gregory was selected to play for Auckland B against Thames Valley in Paeroa. Auckland B won 18-3 with Gregory playing in the halves. Then on 28 July he made his full Auckland debut in an 8-6 win over North Auckland at Kensington Park, Whangarei. Gregory kicked a conversion which were the points which ultimately won the match. He was later selected to go on the Auckland 'southern tour' but was expected to join the team with reinforcements when they arrived at Wellington but he did not make the trip. Gregory finished the season having played 11 times for Ponsonby. His final rugby match was in their 7 a-side team which beat Eden in the tournament final 20-0 with Gregory kicking 4 conversions. The match was played at Avondale Racecourse as part of a full day of 7 a-side games across several grades. In 1923 he again pulled on the Ponsonby jersey playing 12 games for their first grade side and kicking 13 goals for them. After 2 rounds there was discussion of who would replace Stuart Findlay at fullback for Auckland as he was not going to play in 1923. It was said of Gregory that he was \\"easily the best custodian that has been seen on the main ground Eden Park so far\\". \\"He has gained a deal in weight and confidence since last season, and if he keeps up the form shown on Saturday he should be in the running\\". Gregory did indeed gain selection for Auckland and he was their regular fullback throughout the representative season. His first match was against Southland and he was forced from the field with an injury early in the first half in an easy 37-3 win at Eden Park on 4 August. He dived in to stop an attack and received a head injury. He recovered in time to play fullback again against Taranaki in a 30-9 win in front of 12,000 spectators at Eden Park. On 18 August at the same venue he had little to do defensively in a 58-0 win over Wanganui. A win over Northland 33-6 followed. He was again safe at fullback for Auckland's 16-5 win over Otago in front of the largest crowd of the season at Eden Park of 13,000. A feature of his play had been his positional play, solid defense, and good return kicking which became a hallmark of his career. Gregory's next representative match was for the Auckland Provincial team made up of players from the larger Auckland region with the opponents the touring New South Wales team. The match was played in front of 15,000 spectators at Eden Park on 8 September. Auckland won 27 to 11 with Gregory heavily involved. He then played for his Auckland side in a 21-15 win over Wellington, once again at Eden Park. Auckland's most significant match of the season was next for Gregory. They traveled to McLean Park in Napier to take on Hawke's Bay for the Ranfurly Shield. With 10,000 in attendance the Hawke's Bay side retained the shield with a 20-5 win. After Sheen was injured Gregory moved into the five-eighth position, James Molloy replacing him at fullback. Gregory and Karl Ifwersen were said to be defending George Nepia and Lui Paewai \\"especially well\\" before he was later moved back to fullback. It was later said that he was a disappointment at fullback. His final game in an Auckland rugby jersey came in a match against King Country at Taumarunui which Auckland won 18-9. He was named in the reserves to play against Hawke's Bay in their 'return match' at Eden Park but he did not take the field with Malloy being preferred in the fullback position, and so his playing season came to an end. =Switch to rugby league, Marist Old Boys (Saints) and Auckland debuts= Gregory began the 1924 season playing for Ponsonby once again, however his only appearance was in their first round match against University. They won 6-0 with Gregory kicking 2 penalty goals. He then applied for permission to play rugby league and at the Auckland Rugby League management committee meeting on 8 May he was granted reinstatement to the Marist Old Boys club. His debut was against the Ponsonby rugby league side in a 10-3 win at Carlaw Park in front of 3,000 spectators with Gregory converting both Marist tries. The New Zealand Herald reported that \\"a smoother display of fullback play than that given by Gregory has not often been seen on Carlaw Park\\". The following week their match was postponed and then Gregory was selected in the Auckland training squad to prepare for a match against the touring Australian Universities side. He ultimately did not make the playing XIII. Gregory then played in 2 more Marist wins over Richmond Rovers and Athletic respectively before being chosen in the 'Auckland' Possible trial side which played the probables as a curtain-raiser to the Auckland v Australian Universities 3rd match on 14 June. Gregory played in his regular fullback position and kicked a conversion in a 14-9 win to the Possibles. He played 4 more matches for Marist who were thrashing most opponents and on their way to their first ever first grade title. These games were punctuated by an appearance for Auckland B against Hamilton on 16 July. He kicked 2 conversions in a 28-18 win at Carlaw Park. Then following another win for Marist over City Rovers Gregory was selected for Auckland to play against the touring England. Auckland went down 11-24 in front of an enormous crowd of 20,000 at Carlaw Park. It was said of Gregory that he \\"did fairly well, but was bustled at times by the opposing forwards\\". That was Gregory's final representative match of the season though he played 8 further matches for Marist including the championship final with Devonport United which Marist won 20-17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000. Gregory kicked 3 conversions and a penalty in the victory. =New Zealand selection and debut= The 1925 season saw Gregory make his New Zealand debut when he was selected to go on the New Zealand tour of Australia. He had played 7 matches for Marist kicking 15 goals prior to selection. Tragedy marred the Marist campaign however with Gregory‚Äôs team mate Bill Stormont succumbing to Rheumatic heart disease on 4 June with Marist's match 2 days later being cancelled. Gregory was selected to play in an Auckland trial match on 27 June which his \\"A Team\\" lost 0-5. He was described multiple times in a match report as being as usual 'safe' in the fullback position. He was then picked for the tour and made his debut prior to their departure in a match against Auckland. He played fullback in a 16-9 win in a sea of mud at Carlaw Park but still managed to give a \\"fine display\\". His selection was as part of a 22 man squad which departed aboard the Moeraki to Sydney on 3 July. He was chosen as one of two fullbacks alongside New Zealand incumbent Craddock Dufty. He was joined in the squad by Marist team mates Hec Brisbane, Jack Kirwan, and Jim O‚ÄôBrien. Gregory was omitted from the first two matches of the tour and made his first appearance against Newcastle on 18 July. New Zealand won 29-11 before 8,000 spectators at Newcastle Sports Ground with Gregory at fullback, with Dufty playing in the centres. He then played in the 5th match of the tour against New South Wales on 25 July at the Newcastle Sports Ground again. A crowd of 13,000 saw New Zealand with an upset 17-10 win. Gregory was mentioned for his defence during the match saving New Zealand on several occasions with his tackling and kicking. He was in the reserves for the match with Queensland but came on through injury early in the match with Jim Parkes leaving the field. New Zealand went down heavily 43-19 at the Exhibition Oval in Queensland though Gregory along with Wilson Hall and Maurice Wetherill were named as the \\"outstanding New Zealand players\\" with Gregory playing a \\"brilliant game\\" before a crowd of 28,000. He was fullback again in a 21-22 loss to Ipswich at the North Ipswich Reserve on 5 August. The tour was not going well from a results point of view with Gregory again involved in the 5th loss of the tour in match 9 against the Queensland team. New Zealand going down 20-29. He was then in the side which was defeated by Toowoomba 14-16 at the Athletic Oval there on 12 August before a crowd of 4,500. This time however he was playing in the centres with Dufty at fullback. In what was overall a disappointing tour New Zealand recorded their most impressive win over New South Wales 19-18 at the Sydney Cricket Ground before 16,000 spectators on 15 August. The final match of the tour which Gregory was again at fullback saw New Zealand on the losing side 25-26 to a Southern Division side at Cootamundra. The game was marked by the local team receiving 28 free kicks to New Zealand‚Äôs 3 with the New Zealand side expressing \\"strong dissatisfaction with the referee's rulings\\". After their return the New Zealand side played Auckland at Carlaw Park and thrashed them 41-17. Gregory was heavily involved both defensively and on attack. A week later they met the Queensland side which was touring New Zealand. A crowd of 18,000 people were on hand to see New Zealand win 25-24 with a large second half comeback after trailing 19-5 at halftime. Four days later he was again at fullback for Auckland‚Äôs 18-18 draw against the same opponents. He gave a \\"sound display\\" stopping several Queensland attacks. Gregory was then part of the New Zealand team who played Queensland once again but this time they were badly defeated 14-35. Gregory was busy at fullback though and was said to be \\"sound\\" though \\"overshadowed by Jim Craig, the Queensland fullback\\". To this point in the season Gregory had played 21 matches which was an abnormally large amount for a New Zealand rugby league player in this era, however he was not finished yet. On 19 September he represented Auckland in a match with South Auckland (Waikato) which Auckland won 36-19 and thus retained the Northern Union Cup. He then played in the Stormont Shield semi-final which was a trophy played for in honour of his team mate who had passed away earlier in the year, Bill Stormont. Marist lost 22-23 to Ponsonby though Gregory scored a rare try and kicked 5 goals for a 13 point haul. Then in the final match of the Auckland season he kicked 2 conversions in a 16-26 loss to Ponsonby as part of the Labour Day carnival. =New Zealand tour of England= 1926 was again to be an incredibly busy year for Charles Gregory where he played in 28 matches. He played 6 games for Marist before being selected in the reserves for the Auckland team to play South Auckland (Waikato) on 26 June. However the match which was being played as a trial match for the New Zealand team was so lopsided that at halftime when Auckland led 33-3, six of the Auckland players, including Gregory took the field for the South Auckland side. They ultimately won 49-15. Gregory then played in a trial for the A Team which his side lost 16-25, before a match for Auckland against ‚Äòthe rest‚Äô which Auckland lost 21-28. His final trial match was for New Zealand Possibles versus New Zealand Probables, though with 26 players being taken on the tour of England his place was reasonably assured. His possibles side ran out 32-15 winners. The New Zealand Herald reporter wrote that Gregory \\"played a particularly sound game ‚Ä¶ and has seldom given a better exhibition\\". Gregory was then named in the New Zealand side for the historic tour of England. He played 2 further club matches for Marist before departing New Zealand shores on 3 August aboard the R.M.M.S Aorangi. It was said that several members of the New Zealand team suffered \\"severely from sea-sickness on the trip across the Pacific [and] that C. Gregory was one of the worst cases\\". It was so bad in fact that when the team stopped off in Suva, Fiji and played a practice game he along with Ernie Herring were absent due the effects of their sea sickness. Gregory‚Äôs first match of the tour was in the 4th game against Rochdale Hornets on 23 September at Athletic Grounds, Rochdale. New Zealand recorded a narrow 11-9 win after a late comeback with Gregory at fullback. He then played in the next match against Widnes which saw New Zealand win 15-5 in front of 6,000 spectators. His third match was in the first test against England at Wigan before 14,550 spectators. New Zealand was defeated 20-28 although Gregory was said to have \\"played a grand game at fullback\\". He was again a standout in New Zealand's 19-11 win over York in their next match, said to be among the \\"best of the visitors\\" along with Stan Webb, Bert Avery, and Henry. He was again at fullback 3 days later for the 5-17 loss to Warrington in rain and a heavy gale. He was said to be New Zealand's best player in the match though the team was criticised as being \\"third rate\\" by the Daily News in England. Gregory scored his first points of the tour when he converted a try in a 35-15 win over Bramley on 13 October. He was the hero in the match with Hull which New Zealand won 15-13 before a crowd of 12,000. Hull had not been beaten for 35 consecutive matches on their home ground. During the second half Gregory kicked a penalty goal and then converted Hec Brisbane's try before converting Wilson Hall's last minute try to win the match for New Zealand. New Zealand had their fortunes reversed against Oldham on 23 October when they went down 10-15 although Gregory was said to have \\"often cleared well when hard pressed\\" before a crowd of 15,000. Gregory was once again at fullback for the match against Leeds which New Zealand won 13-11 with him said to be \\"the safest fullback\\". St Helens Recreation proved too strong with a 28-14 win despite having four regular players absent. Gregory converted a try late in the match with the result a foregone conclusion. Gregory was then selected for the second test against England at Hull. New Zealand went down 11-21 before a relatively small crowd of 8,000 as poor results and internal strife in the New Zealand team had done little to inspire interest from the local supporters. Gregory kicked a second half penalty and said to have been \\"safe at fullback\\". During the match Gregory injured his hand which meant that he was unable to play for a period after the test. Gregory returned to fullback for a 14-16 loss to Swinton 2 weeks later on 27 November. A week later New Zealand played their third test of the tour with Gregory at fullback for their test match with Wales at Pontypridd. New Zealand were thrashed 34-8 in front of 10,000 spectators. On 4 December he was on the end of a 12-22 defeat by St Helens. Then he was unfortunate in the next match with Wigan 3 days later on 11 December. He twisted his knee in the second half and had to leave the field. New Zealand had only trailed 12-14 at the interval but with him and Kirwan having to leave the field New Zealand had to continue with 11 players and fell away to lose 15-36. His knee injury was likely to have been serious because he took no part in the final 9 matches of the tour. Therefore he finished having played in 15 matches in total. After returning to New Zealand the Auckland based members of the side then played in a New Zealand XIII against the local Auckland side and they went down 21-24 with Gregory in his usual position at fullback for the returnees. =Continuation of club career and local representative league= Gregory returned to the club fields of Auckland in 1927 and played 12 games for Marist before being selected in the Auckland team to play Canterbury on 10 September. Auckland had embarked on a rare tour and the match was played at Monica Park, in Christchurch. Auckland won 24-13 before 3,000 spectators. The local media were particularly impressed by his play saying that \\"Wetherill and Gregory had a trick up their sleeves in all sorts of positions, and worked the scissors and reverse passes very cleverly‚Ä¶ Dufty was always ready to join in, and at a signal from Gregory‚Ä¶ was up in a flash to take a scissors pass‚Ä¶\\", and that he is a \\"great footballer, who can take all sorts of passes at speed\\". He then was part of the Auckland side which defeated Otago at the Caledonian Ground in Dunedin 20-13 before a crowd of 2,000. He started in the centres but switched positions with Dufty at halftime. A week later Gregory was selected to play in the North Island v South Island inter-island match for the first time. He played in the five eighths position and set up Auckland‚Äôs second try in a 13-8 win. Gregory then finished the season playing in the same position in a match against Buller at Carlaw Park. Auckland romped to a 60-33 win with Gregory for the first time in his senior career scoring 3 tries in a match, and he also kicked a conversion. The 1928 season saw Gregory elected on to the management committee of the Marist Old Boys club as part of the executive committee. He only played one representative match during the season which was for the Auckland Possibles side against the Probables in July. It was part of a series of trial matches in preparation to pick the New Zealand team to play the touring England side. He kicked a conversion though his side lost 14-24 and ultimately he was not selected for the New Zealand side. He did however have a busy year for Marist, playing 16 games for them and kicking 21 goals, and was part of their Roope Rooster, Stormont Shield, and Labour Day tournament winning sides. At the start of the 1929 season Gregory had announced his retirement though one week into the season he was back on the playing field. His club form was very good, and he was the second highest point scorer in the competition with 62 points behind Frank Delgrosso (108), while he scored 71 points for Marist across all 13 games he played for them. On 17 August he played for Auckland against Northland with Auckland winning 22-19, then a week later he was in the side for their easy 47-18 win over Canterbury before 10,000 at Carlaw Park. He then gained selection for the North Island v South Island match. He kicked a conversion though was on the losing side with the South Island securing a 22-13 victory. At the end of the season in October Marist played against the South Sydney side who were the first ever Australian side to tour New Zealand. Marist defeated them 10-9 in front of an enormous crowd of 15,000 with Gregory scoring all of Marists points through 2 tries, a conversion and a penalty. A week later they met again in front of a similar sized crowd though this time they fell 5-21 with Gregory kicking a penalty. =New Zealand 1930 tour of Australia= Such was Gregory's consistent form through 1929 and into 1930 that he gained selection for the New Zealand team to tour Australia and was named captain. He had played 5 matches for Marist, scoring 29 points. Then in the New Zealand Probables side in their trial match he scored a try and kicked 3 conversions in their 28-3 win over the Possibles. Gregory played in 12 of the 13 matches. His first match was against New South Wales in Sydney with New Zealand going down 16-5. He played in the five eighths which we did in 7 of the matches, with the other 5 at fullback. He kicked 3 conversions and a penalty in a 20-14 win against Western Division in the second match of the tour at Bathurst Bathurst Sports Ground. He was at fullback for New Zealand‚Äôs heavy 29-2 loss to New South Wales before a crowd of 19,060 in Sydney. New Zealand lost three players to injury and eventually only had 10 players on the field. Gregory had a better time of it against New England at Armidale when they won 34-19 and he scored a try. Two losses followed for Gregory and New Zealand against Queensland in Brisbane by 14-11, and 32-6 respectively. They managed a win over Brisbane 19-17 again under the leadership of Gregory though he was at fullback for the match. The side then traveled back down to Sydney where they played the Sydney Metropolis side and went down 39-22 before losing by a similar score of 34-22 to the same opponent 2 days later. Gregory was again leading from fullback against a Southern Division side at Young Showground in the town of Young, New South Wales with New Zealand winning 24-20. The final two matches of the tour continued this winning theme. Gregory had moved back to the five eighth position after spending a few matches at full back and New Zealand defeated Newcastle at the Newcastle Showgrounds 25-22. They then beat a Universities XIII side 18-12 with Gregory crossing the line for a try in what would prove to be his last ever performance for New Zealand against foreign opponents. Upon their return mention was made by the management of the side that injuries had played a huge part in their tour results with 16 of the 22 players injured with some of them serious. Gregory said \\"although we are disappointed with the result of the tour, it was casualties that beat us to a large extent. The hard grounds caused a terrible lot of accidents, ankle injuries alone being suffered by seven of the team\\". He was also critical of the selection of only one halfback meaning Abbott had to play in every single match. Like on previous tours the New Zealand side returned and played against Auckland at Carlaw Park. Gregory was at fullback for New Zealand‚Äôs 34-27 win, ending his career on a positive note with 4 consecutive wins. =Retirement and coaching= The 1931 season was to be his last. He had semi retired and only returned to play a handful of matches for Marist to help them as required. He did however play well, and scored 21 points in 5 appearances. His final two matches were in the two end of season wins which secured Marist the Fox Memorial title which was being competed for for the first time in its history. He ultimately finished with 86 appearances for Marist over his 8 seasons with them. In 1934 he became the coach of the Marist senior side when they finished last in the competition. He continued to coach them in 1935 when they improved and finished mid table. He was unable to continue coaching Marist in 1936 as he had moved to an \\"outer district\\" of Auckland and \\"found it inconvenient to retain a position he has held with credit\\". He did however appear to take on the Marist reserve grade side and then mid season he took over the responsibilities of the Ellerslie third grade side in a coaching role indicating he had moved to that area. They went on to win the championship for the grade. One of the players in this third grade side under his tutelage was Arthur McInnarney who became Kiwi number 276 at just 18 years of age in 1939. In 1938 he had transferred to Mt Albert and debuted in the first five position creating an immediate impression. Personal life Charles Edward Gregory married Alma Mabel Bridgford on 24 November 1930. He worked as a lineman in Auckland. On 12 January 1935 he was seriously injured in a fall from an Auckland Transport Board tower lorry. At the time he was repairing some overhead lines which had been damaged by a tram pole near the junction of Khyber Pass Road and Broadway in Newmarket when the line fell loose and knocked him off the platform. He fell 20 feet to the ground landing on the small of his back and suffered spinal injuries though he did not lose consciousness. He was said to be living at 7 Dorset Street in Westmere at the time. Fortunately he recovered well considering the seriousness of the fall and this was mentioned at the annual meeting of the Marist club 2 and a half months later. He was able to continue with his coaching duties that season with Marist finishing mid table.

He served as president of the Congress of Deputies in two occasions, in April 1837 and from December 27, 1841 to July 16, 1842, and as minister of Home Affairs under prime minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Calatrava y Peinado from June 9, 1837 to August 18, 1837, when the government resigned. An hacendado and member of the National Militia, he was elected member of the Congress of Deputies for Ja√©n in October 1834, replacing Juan Manuel Subrie. He got 18 votes out of 18 possible votes of its constituency. He was re- elected in the July 1836 general election and, after the revolt of the sergeants of the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso in October 1836, he joined the committee responsible for writing the new Constitution, being one of the signing MPs. In the 1837 and 1839 general elections he was senator for Ja√©n until March 1841 when he resigned to occupy a seat in the lower house. In December 1841, he was elected president of the Congress replacing Agust√≠n Arg√ºelles until July 1842. In 1843, he was re-elected one last time as senator for Ja√©n, being elected Second Vice President of the Senate. Luis de Sol√≠s y Manso, 6th Marquess of Rianzuela, dedicated him a brief and commendable obituary in which he indicated that Acu√±a y Cuadros was a descendant of Bishop Antonio Osorio de Acu√±a and he said that he was owner of a considerable fortune in connections and lordships in Las Encartaciones, although, Acu√±a was a supporter of the ideas of progress even if they were contrary to his interests, defended the separation and confiscation to favor the division and increase of property.

At its first sale, on 29 March 1884, it passed from the estate of Castellani into the Butler collection with an attribution to Piero della Francesca, but this was abandoned before Wilhelm von Bode bought the painting for the Strasbourg museum in 1893.

She was first woman elected to the Birmingham school board in 1873. Life Sturge was born in Edgbaston. Her mother was Mary Darby (born Dickinson) and her father was Charles Sturge who was once Mayor of Birmingham. She came from an important Quaker family. Her aunt was the pacifist Sophia Sturge and her uncle Joseph Sturge was a leading abolitionist. The Birmingham Women's Suffrage Society was formed in 1868 and in 1871 Sturge became its secretary. The BWSS was related to the National Society for Women's Suffrage which in time became the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). This was a suffragist organisation. The suffragettes did not start until 1903. She rose to be vice-President of the BWSS and she spoke frequently on the subject. She noted that the gallantry that her gender received was no substitute for the right to vote. In 1871 she used the phrase \\"When words needed saying and deeds needed doing...\\". In 1872 she, as BWSS President, gave a rousing speech in support of women getting the vote on the same platform as Millicent Fawcett at Birmingham Town Hall. The speeches were later published as pamphlets. In 1873 the Liberal's added her to the list of candidates to serve on School boards. She was elected in third place. Her contributions during her time on the board were said to be impressive but her views were frequently overshadowed by the existing male patriarchy. She stood down in 1876 to concentrate more time on women's suffrage. Sturge died in Edgbaston in 1905 at her niece's house. Mary Sturge was able to certify the death as she had benefited from a medical education and she became a surgeon in that year. Mary inherited all of Eliza's legacy including being able to vote in 1918.

The swamps are generally set back a few kilometers or two from the sea by the saltwater-affected Sunda Shelf mangroves The relatively fertile, flat soil has led to much of this ecoregion being converted to agriculture.  Location and description  The freshwater swamp forests of the southwest coast of Borneo occur where rivers on flat alluvial plains meet the coastal mangroves. The resulting sediment and periodic inundation produce more nutrient-rich, less acidic soil, and taller trees than then peat swamps  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month.  Flora and fauna  The makeup of these forests varies according to patterns of inundation, soil nutrient levels and acidity. There are grassy wetlands, marshes, areas of scrub, and areas of Pandanus and palm trees. The mature forest supports a wide variety of tree and shrub species, including the families and genera of (Adina) (a shrub), (Alstonia) (some species of which are of commercial value for timber), (Campnosperma), (Coccoceras), (Dillenia), (Dyera), (Erythrina), (Eugenia), (Ficus), (Gluta), (Lophopetalum), (Memecylon), (Pentaspadon), (Shorea), and (Vatica). Diversity of faunal species is higher than in the peat swamp. The most common primate in the freshwater swamp is the vulnerable Crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis). The freshwater swamp is also home to the critically endangered Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). Over 360 species of birds have been recorded in this ecoregion.  Protected areas  Over 14% of the ecoregion is officially protected.

She chaired the Medieval Studies department, and was also Dean of Summer Sessions at UCSB in 2011‚Äì2013.  Education  Pasternack received her PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1983.  Research  Her research interests included history of the English language, Old and Middle English literature, theories concerning oral tradition (especially the techniques of scops or oral poets) and textual transmission of early medieval texts, feminist approaches to medieval literature, and sex and gender in the early Middle Ages. Her first monograph was The Textuality of Old English Poetry, published by Cambridge University Press in 1995. In The Textuality of Old English Poetry, Pasternack argued for the techniques of transmission of oral and textual poetry: \\"In a primary oral culture, to solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence.\\" (p. 62), and \\"Whenever scribes who are part of the oral traditional culture write or copy traditional oral works, they do not merely mechanically hand them down; they rehear them, 'mouth' them, 'reperform' them in the act of writing in such a way that the text may change but remain authentic, just as a completely oral poet's text changes from performance to performance without losing authenticity\\" (p. 27). Rosamund S. Allen, writing in the Modern Language Review in 1997 praised Pasternack for \\"establishing new ways of reading Old English [...] reject[ing] the 'New Critical' mode of treating Old English poems like modern written texts, with definable boundaries and an identifiable author.

The case is particularly notable for two reasons: Hammar was later described as the most dangerous criminal in Finland of his time, and a year later, on board the same ship another murder took place. Murder On the morning of 10 July 1986, towards the end of their journey, Eljaala, Hammar and an associate of the latter, had gone into Eljaala's cabin, where Hammar stole money from Eljaala's wallet. Eljaala intended to report this to the police, but as he was leaving the cabin to do so, Hammar stabbed him five times in the throat with a dinner knife, followed by strangling him to death with a strip of fabric torn from the cabin's bedsheet, assisted by his accomplice. Reijo Hammar Hammar was found guilty of murdering Eljaala and sentenced to life imprisonment. Approximately two years later, in July 1988, he escaped from prison with two other inmates, in the process shooting a prison guard in the arm with a sawn- off shotgun. The escapees went on to carry out a number of bank robberies. Hammar later killed one of the men, by hitting him on the head with an axe following an argument. Eventually Hammar was caught in Stockholm, after a few weeks on the run. Due to his record of murders, armed robberies and other serious crimes, he was considered at the time the most dangerous criminal in Finland.

She earned a doctorate in natural sciences and became active in the movement for Puerto Rican independence from the United States.  Biography  Laura Meneses del Carpio was born on March 31, 1894 in the city of Arequipa, Peru, the youngest daughter of Emilia del Carpio Tupayachi and Juan Rosa Meneses del Pino, who was a colonel in the Peruvian army. = Education = Meneses studied natural sciences at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima, Peru, graduating with a bachelors degree in biology in 1913. In 1918, she was awarded a doctorate in natural sciences at the same university. She spoke Spanish and English fluently as well as two indigenous languages from South America, Quechua and Aymara. In 1920, on the recommendation of the family of a Peruvian composer residing in Boston, Meneses enrolled in the all-female Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts (which today is a part of Harvard). While there she met her future husband, the budding attorney and Puerto Rican activist Pedro Albizu Campos. They married two years later. With her husband, she became an important activist in a popular movement seeking independence for Puerto Rico from control by the United States. By doing so, Menses and Albizu Campos both became targets of American officials. In 1937, Albizu Campos and the other Puerto Rican Nationalist leaders were sentenced to the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta; he was not released for almost eleven years. Because her husband spent decades in detention (he spent 25 years in U.S. prisons), the couple was able to spend only 13 years together out of their 43 years of marriage. = Mexican years = Her husband was jailed again in 1950 after the defeat of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts. Later that same year, Meneses moved with her children to Havana, Cuba, on behalf of her husband to denounce American imperialism there and in Puerto Rico. However, because of harassment from the U.S.-backed military dictator President Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, she moved again, this time to Mexico City. There she came to know Fidel Castro, Ernesto ‚ÄòChe‚Äô Guevara, and other members of the July 26 Movement, and she actively supported the Cuban revolutionaries by writing press releases and other literature supporting their cause. For many years, Meneses sought permission from the United States to visit Puerto Rico to see her husband who was ailing there, but she was denied on technicalities. Thereafter, she was repeatedly denied visas to visit Puerto Rico as well as the U.S. mainland. = Cuban years = When the Cuban revolution succeeded in 1958, Meneses was granted Cuban citizenship and was appointed a special envoy from the Cuban mission to the United Nations, which allowed her to legally visit New York City. While there, she took advantage of the opportunity to pursue the liberation of political prisoners like her husband as well as the island of Puerto Rico itself. Meneses attended the first Latin American Women‚Äôs Congress in Santiago, Chile in 1959 and, according to the Chilean press, \\"she was the most applauded delegate.\\" In 1960 she was allowed to attend the International Women‚Äôs Federation and this invitation, in turn, gave her the opportunity to visit other international destinations, including Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and China. Because of diplomatic pressure from the Cuban government, she was finally allowed to travel to Puerto Rico in 1965 to visit her ailing husband. He died shortly thereafter in San Juan. Meneses returned to Havana and died on April 15, 1973. Her remains were buried in the city's old Col√≥n Cemetery.

The people were murdered in what was described as Soviet reprisals against civilians for anti-communist resistance members and their military actions aimed against the Red Army. When a Red Army unit entered the village to search for resistance members, several villagers hid under an irrigation canal. The Russian commander told the elders to bring out all the people in the tunnel, but the elders said there is nobody there. When one man emerged from the stairway, contradicting the elders, the Russian commander ordered that all the people under ground come out. When the people bellow refused, they were killed by being burned alive in an explosion caused through a mix of gasoline, pentrite and trinitrotoluene, thrown into the canal to rout them out. The people in the canal were either hidding to avoid military drafting or were afraid of Soviet attacks. According to the reports, 11 villagers were forced to look at the murders by the Red Army. 105 people were killed in the crime, including children, old people and combatants. 61 of the victims were villagers. Hundreds of Red Army soldiers stayed in the village, to look if any combatants would intervene to defend the village. Six helicopters and two jet fighters provided air support to the Red Army unit. They left the following day. It took seven days for the villagers to remove all the corpses from the canal, since the chemicals in the water would burn the feet of the people who tried to descend down the canal. 2,500 armed guerrillas showed up later in the village, to prevent the Soviet army to return to it. The Afghan embassy rejected the witness accounts of the massacre, claiming that the tunnels are too small for people to hide in them, though investigators contradicted them, claiming that the said tunnels are over four feet in height.

Biography  Osmanli was born in Bitola, People's Republic of Macedonia, at that time a constituent republic of Yugoslavia. His father Dimitrie Osmanli was an acclaimed Macedonian film, theater director and author, whilst his mother was of Greek heritage from Thesaloniki. Osmanli was raised to speak both Macedonian and Greek languages, and was taught Aromanian by his paternal uncle. The family moved to Skopje when he was two years old. Osmanli studied law at the Saints Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, where his father also lectured and was a profound influence in his formative years. In 1981 Osmanli published his seminal work –§–∏–ª–º–æ—Ç –∏ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–∫–æ—Ç–æ (English: Film and Politics) a theoretical study of political cinema. In 1987 Osmanli released –°—Ç—Ä–∏–ø: –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å —Å–æ —á–æ–≤–µ—á–∫–∏ –ª–∏–∫ (English: Comics: Scripture of the Human Image), the first scholarly work dedicated to Comics studies published in Yugoslavia. Osmanli served as an independent editor and member of editing board of his nations oldest daily newspaper Nova Makedonija from 1991 to 1998, and as chief of arts and cultural programs at Telma TV between 1998 and 2016.  Personal life  Osmanli was married to Sne≈æana Stankoviƒá, a orriginal founder and a vice-president of the Skopje based think-tank group Council on Foreign Relations, fellow academic and adviser to former Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov. The couple had two children, son Dimitar and daughter Aleksandra. He was widowed following the death of his wife from cancer in 2013. Apart from his native Macedonian, Osmanli is fluent in Greek, Aromanian, Serbo-Croatian, English, French, Italian and Latin. He is also an avid bibliophile, usually reading several books simultaneously.

This painting is representative of the early part of Stevens' career, when he was keen on representing the squalor of the time through realist painting. Context Alfred Stevens was born in Brussels in 1823, and moved to Paris (where he would spend the rest of his life) in the 1840s. His early work, such as portraiture of soldiers and depiction of social scenes, was part of a pictorial trend that emerged in both Belgium and France in those years, namely, social realism. Between 1845 and 1857, Stevens focused on contemporary hard daily life as a subject. At the 1853 Paris Salon, for instance, he showed drunken carnival-goers returning home; at the 1855 Exposition Universelle, he made his breakthrough with Ce qu‚Äôon appelle le vagabondage (This is What They Call Vagrancy; What is called Vagrancy) or The Hunters of Vincennes (Les Chasseurs de Vincennes), today housed at the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris. The realist oil was presented at the 1855 exposition together with three other paintings by Stevens: La Sieste, Le Premier jour du d√©vouement and La Mendiante. The fact that as a new, inexperienced foreign painter Stevens had some success with his paintings, selling both is centerpieces of the 1853 Salon and 1855 world's fair, probably had more to do with his skills rather than the choice of subject. While some critics, such as Ernest Geba√ºer, praised the painting and described the moving qualities of the scene (Cette sc√®ne est touchante, Geba√ºer, 1855), others noted some anomaly, the left foot of the kind passer-by being strangely distant from her body. Emperor Napoleon III thought the contents so shocking (a woman giving a beggar money to prevent her being locked up with her children by the police, which was the fate of vagrants without income) that he asked Count de Nieuwerkerke to have it removed. Stevens attached much importance to the tradition of Flemish and Dutch (genre) painting, and held a great admiration for the technical precision and illusionistic representation, the unparalleled reproduction of fabrics, and the symbolism of the early Netherlandish painters. He was strongly influenced by the Old Flemish Masters, especially Johannes Vermeer. This earned him comparisons with some highly respected old masters (such as Gerard Ter Borch), a fairly common practice in the second half of the nineteenth century, linked to the rise of national schools. Even though Stevens lived the major part of his life in Paris, the French critics still considered him a Flemish (Belgian), indebted to the rich artistic heritage of the Low Countries. Over the 19th century, law and order, or the management and control (meaning surveillance and repression) of individuals liable to disrupt the social order, became increasingly a popular issue in France. A worker's record book, an ID for use within national borders, and the version of this document issued to those who fell into indigence, served not only for identification but also for the surveillance of a worker's movements; it could also be used to track itinerant merchants, street artists, the indigent and the vagrant. A decree dated 5 July 1808 had prohibited begging and created departmental depots where able-bodied beggars would be taken and employed. The attribute ‚Äúvagabond‚Äù made the situation worse, with ‚Äúvagrant beggars‚Äù being taken to detention centres. The 1810 Penal Code considered begging a crimearts. 274 and 275 and vagrancy likewise.art. 269 While beggars were not clearly defined, vagrants were clearly identified as ‚Äúunscrupulous people [i.e.] those who have no certain place of residence or means of subsistence and who do not exercise any trade or profession‚Äù.art. 270 Beggars and vagrants could be sentenced to from three to six months‚Äô imprisonment, or even two to five years if they were carrying weapons. This sentence could be followed by a further period of enforced labour in begging depots. During the Second Republic, the electoral law of May 31, 1850 further alienated beggars and vagabonds, separating the homeless from the rest of society by prolonging the period of residence required in order to be able to vote in a particular commune or canton, from six months (law of March 15, 1849) to three years. Painting Female vagrant and her children A Parisian street is the setting for this urban drama. Soldiers lead a mother and her ragged children away to prison for the crime of vagrancy. An elegant woman is trying to intercede with the soldiers, while a frustrated workman stands on her right. The attempt is doomed to failure as shown by the soldier's gesture of refusal. A similar scene can be found in Victor Hugo's Things Seen. Stevens approaches the theme of poverty from a political rather than a social angle, choosing to depict not only individual generosity (represented by the wealthy woman attempting to intervene with the soldiers), but also State repression. The State, personified here by the soldiers (one of whom appears to reject the charitable gesture of the wealthy lady), does not protect but rather seems to consider the homeless mother and her young children (the weakest and most fragile in society) as harmful, dangerous, even criminal. The choice of the wintry season, the gloomy light, the dark shades of the clothes and uniforms, the absence of a horizon (blocked by the dark grey wall in the background which fills the entire width of the painting), the simplicity of the characters (the cold and unwavering soldiers, the mother resigned, the lame worker with his crutch, the tearful child, and the wealthy woman attempting an act of generosity) all contribute to making this scene spontaneously moving. On the long grey wall, posters referring to property sales (\\"sale by auction\\") and the pleasures of high society (\\"ball\\"), conflict with the poverty and sorrow described in the painting. The different social groups who occupy the same urban space find themselves side by side here in a moving composition, and the role of the State, purely repressive, does not come out well. Stevens' objective was to denounce the poor living conditions in the towns and the cruel treatment meted out to those who lived there. As mentioned, the message struck a chord with Napoleon III who, upon seeing this painting at the 1855 Universal Exhibition, supposedly remarked: \\"That will not happen again.\\" Accordingly, the Emperor ordered that any vagrants should henceforth be taken to the Conciergerie, not on foot, but hidden away in a closed carriage.

He graduated from the Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Belgrade. He was among the organizers of 1992 student demonstrations against Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and he had an opportunity to meet with Milo≈°eviƒá as well. According to Dragan ƒêilas, who is a best man to ƒêorƒëeviƒá, he his good friend. He was a co-founder of Direct Media in April 2001. Djordjevic was also one of the co- owners of \\"MD International\\", which ƒêilas founded in the Czech Republic in 1995. = Political career = He is one of the founders of the humanitarian organization \\"Our Serbia\\" which has implemented a program to help children of the killed, abducted and missing during the past wars in our area (i.e. children of killed members of the army and police and civilian victims of war).

In May 2010, then-Montenegrin Prime Minister and leader of the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), Milo ƒêukanovic, described him as a man tasked with helping the opposition in Montenegro. He was the Secretary of the Council for Serbs in the region and the diaspora in which the participators were President, Prime Minister, competent ministers and Bishop Grigorije (Duriƒá). Since 2018, he has been active within the Alliance for Serbia, an opposition political alliance founded with the aim of overthrowing Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and the Serbian Progressive Party. The alliance eventually dissolved in September 2020, and ƒêorƒëeviƒá founded a new political movement called Liberation. He has been going around Serbia and talking with former and active members of both the ruling and opposition parties, wanting to gather all those who are dissatisfied with the situation on both sides of the political spectrum. On 14 October, Liberation held a first gathering in Ora≈°ac at the location of the beggining of the First Serbian Uprising. As he said, they gathered at the very place from when the liberation of Serbia began in 1804, because \\"every Serb has the spirit of Karaƒëorƒëe and that spark should be released in difficult times like this.\\" ƒêorƒëeviƒá said that they are against the agreement, the recognition of Kosovo or Kosovo's membership in the United Nations. He added that there is no quick solution for Kosovo and that the solution is written in the Constitution of Serbia and Resolution 1244. It was also announced that Liberation \\"will start a kind of series of talks with citizens throughout Serbia, in order to gather all freedom-loving people in a broad front that would oppose Vuƒçiƒá's crime and autocracy.\\" This gathering was described as the start of the 2022 Serbian presidential election campaign.

He served in the National Assembly of Serbia from 2004 to 2016 and was also active with municipal politics in Kragujevac. Poskurica entered politics as a member of the far-right Serbian Radical Party and subsequently joined the breakaway Serbian Progressive Party. Early life and academic career Poskurica was born in Kragujevac, in what was then the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He graduated in 1978, completed a specialization in internal medicine in 1985, received his master's degree in 1989, and earned a Ph.D. in 1993. In 1998, he completed his subspeciality at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Medicine.

This battle was the last attempt of the Democratic Army to operate outside the fortified groups in Grammos and Vitsi. It was the biggest and bloodiest battle in the prefecture of Evros.  Chronicle  One week before May 15, 1949, the surrounding area was occupied by the guerrillas and so the inhabitants of the villages of Paliouri, Polia, Avdella and Alepochori had settled in Metaxades. The soldiers knew about the guerrilla attack and did not let the farmers go to their fields. The attack began on Sunday, May 15. The panicked villagers ran to hide in the surrounding hills, where there were many strongholds (forts hidden in dirt). Each ampri could hold 15 to 20 people. The Hill of Metaxades, which was guarded by Lieutenant Lazos and a detachment of militiamen was one of the most important in Evros. A small army was also in Asvestaria, as it was called then, but quickly fell into the hands of the guerrillas. For twenty-four hours the guerrillas were trying to occupy the hill. But the army, with the help of the inhabitants who had hidden in the fences, repulsed them. He also used mortars and machine guns in contrast to the guerrillas, who were in possession of low-power mortars but did not know how to handle them properly. It was difficult to supply the fort with ammunition and food because the siege was suffocating. The planes that flew over the Hill for this purpose, most of the time accidentally dropped them on the guerrilla points. There were many who wanted to leave Ypsoma but were not allowed to do so by the Lieutenant, who was ordered to protect the fortress of Metaxades at all costs, not to fall into the hands of the guerrillas. So he sent a message for help. The army base was in the Protokklisi from where two Captains were sent to reinforce the fort. But access to it was very difficult. Mines were placed in all the passages. Nevertheless, they broke the siege and entered the battle with a brigade from Ladi and thus managed to defeat the guerrillas. On May 18, the last battle took place where the guerrillas surrendered. Most took refuge in some ravines where they were killed by airstrikes. Those who survived left Greece, followed by their families, but also by other villagers who helped them escape the army's retaliation. Slowly people began to descend into the village to see many houses burned, families torn apart and property destroyed by both the guerrillas and the army chasing anyone who helped them. In time, of course, the wounds healed, they returned to their work and their previous life.

Directed by Marc J Francis and Max Pugh, supported by Oscar-winner Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. and filmed over three years, the film focuses on the daily life and rituals of the monastics, accompanied by teachings from Thich Nhat Hanh's early journals narrated in voice over by Benedict Cumberbatch. The film was released in 2017, premiering at SXSW three years after Thich Nhat Hanh suffered a severe brain haemorrhage in November 2014.  Synopsis  Allowing first time filmed access inside the Plum Village Monastery in France, the film captures the life of the monastic community who have renounced their possessions to practice mindfulness. Captured in v√©rit√© style, the film allows viewers to observe rituals and meditations, alongside day to day activities of people in the sungha. The film also follows the monks and nuns embarking on a US speaking tour, where Thich Nhat Hanh is billed alongside famous cultural figures .  Production  Walk With Me was produced by Speakit Films in association with Benedict Cumberbatch's company, SunnyMarch, with WestEnd Films handling international sales. One third of the film's budget was crowd-funded, and its crew includes sound designer Anna Bertmark, composer Germaine Franco and additional editors Nicholas Chauderge and Alan Mackay. In interviews, the directors discuss the challenges of establishing the film's approach of making the whole community the main character of the film, in line with Thich Nhat Hanh's wish of not making the film about him. Marc J Francis also explains how capturing the film was heavily shaped by the establishment of trust and openness with the community, and how the narrative was eventually created through the passing of the time. Passages from the 1960s Fragrant Palm Leaves were selected as accompanying meditations, and narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch. Benedict Cumberbatch said of the project: 'In my life I‚Äôve been so touched by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh. It was a great honor to work on Walk With Me. I have no doubt that audiences across the world will be moved by this beautifully crafted film.'  Release and reception  The film was released in 2017 and screened at international film festivals like SXSW, BFI London Film Festival 2017, Illuminate Film Festival and Foyle Film Festival Walk With Me was described by The New York Times as 'Cooling to the mind and soothing to the spirit', with The Hollywood Reporter remarking Thich Nhan Hanh's film presence as 'the elusive center ... there‚Äôs little direct experience of him, but his effect on people filters through the onscreen events'. With an approach summarised by Time Out as 'the exact midway point between a documentary and meditation exercise', specialised reviews remark the film as 'A rare insight into an interesting subject' and 'a relief, and a palate cleanser'. Walk With Me was supported by Oscar-winning director Alejandro G Innaritu, who stated in an exclusive interview for Variety days after the premiere: '‚ÄúI loved how [the filmmakers] capture and convey, cinematically, the sometimes inexplicable state of being awakened. It gives a hint of that quiet voice so underrated today and ironically so needed in this time of fear and ignorance.‚Äù  Soundscape  In April 2020, Walk With Me released a meditation experience soundscape produced by Marc J Francis and Matt Coldrick, featuring chants of Plum Village monastic choir, alongside recordings of the sounds of nature and mindfulness bells, and Benedict Cumberbatch‚Äôs elegant readings of Thich Nhat Hanh‚Äôs journals.

It was first published in 1633, two years after Donne‚Äôs death. It is included in the Holy Sonnets ‚Äì a series of poems written by John Donne. According to the currently adopted sequence, the poem comes second in the order.Stringer 2005, p. lxxvi. It has also appeared in all of the proposed sequences so far - changes in positioning were, however, minimal, as the poem has remained in the first or second position ever since publication.Stringer 2005, p. lxxvi. ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles‚Äù is characteristic for its ‚ÄúCalvinist influence in its reversal of the usually attempted move from fear to hope.‚ÄùStachniewski 1981, p. 700. As it begins misleadingly with a description of the speaker‚Äôs devotion to God in the octave, there is no clue that could prepare the reader for the rest of the poem, where the position of the speaker changes.Bellette 1975, pp. 328-329. There, he no longer praises God‚Äôs actions with passive acceptance.Wall 1976, p. 192. Instead, he begins to tremble in fear.Wall 1976, p. 193. The devil comes to the fore,St. Hilaire 2017, p. 596. and despite of everything God has done in favour of mankind, the speaker is not really sure whether he will gain eternal salvation.Coles 2015, p. 921. God might ‚Äúexert himself to beat off the devil, but whether He does so will depend on His free, unobligated choice.‚ÄùStachniewski 1981, p. 701. Such a vision is due to the concept of Predestination ‚Äì according to it, one cannot interfere with fate. Although it lies in the future in the case of the speaker of the sonnet, the choice has been already made, and there is nothing to be done against it.Martin 2015, p. 372. Thus, the doctrinal basis of the poem has been described as Lutheran and Calvinist.Stachniewski 1981, p. 701. Structure of the poem In comparison with many of Donne‚Äôs Holy Sonnets, the structure of this poem is completely reversed.Spurr 1991, p. 170. The usual ‚Äúdespairing tone‚Äù of the octave is here moved to the sestet.Spurr 1991, p. 170. Instead of developing ‚Äúthe problems of fallenness and estrangement‚Äù in the octave and allowing them to be resolved at the end, the poem ‚Äúreverses this process and concludes by refuting what it initially seeks to affirm.‚ÄùLinville 1984, p. 150. There is a common interpretation for this reversal. In the 1633 print edition of Donne‚Äôs poems, ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles‚Äù was placed first, opening the main cycle of twelve sonnets.Stringer 2005, p. lxii. The octave here is ‚Äúless dramatic‚Äù than the sestet, which would be ‚Äúappropriate for the first poem of a meditative sequence that begins traditionally with an opening prayer.‚ÄùEsch 1955, p. 49. Thus, the sonnet was described as ‚Äúa preparatory prayer before making a meditation.‚ÄùGardner 1952, p. xl. The structure of the poem was also called ‚Äúorganic,‚Äù as ‚Äúevery part depends on, and reacts on the other parts.‚ÄùSimon 1952, pp. 123-125. Through ‚Äúa series of parallel phrases governed by strongly placed subordinating elements (initial as, when, till, and the carefully qualifying and placing which and whose),‚Äù the first two quatrains connect with each other, which produces the effect of ‚Äúorder and proper relationship.‚ÄùBellette 1975, p. 329. However, as the typical sequence was reversed, the logical purpose of the octave ‚Äúis destroyed‚Äù in the rest of the poem by the ‚Äúunsatisfying paradoxes‚Äù of the closing couplet.Bellette 1975, pp. 329-330. =Language and style= The octave has a ‚Äúrelatively moderate, logical tone and feeling,‚Äù whereas in the sestet the speaker is ‚Äúmore emotional,‚Äù being ‚Äúindignant at Satan but also at God.‚ÄùRay 1990, pp. 38-39. The speaker begins with enumerating his titles (his ‚Äúlegal rights or entitlements‚Äù towards God),Smith 1971, p. 625. calling himself a ‚Äúson,‚Äù(5) ‚Äúservant,‚Äù(6) ‚Äúsheep,‚Äù(7) ‚Äúimage‚Äù(7) and ‚Äútemple‚Äù(8) of God, and these signify ‚Äúboth God‚Äôs lawful possession of the creature and the status of the creature.‚ÄùShaw 1981, pp. 43-45. By using the insistent repetition of pronouns of the first and second person (especially possessives), the speaker attempts to create a ‚Äúpermanent and inevitable bond‚Äù with God.Pallotti 1993, p. 173. However, he confronts these titles afterwards in the sestet with the fact that the devil ‚Äúusurps‚Äù him (that is, ‚Äúunjustly claims possessions‚Äù of the speaker),Mallett 1983, p. 56. expecting God to act for his individual sake. This highlights a ‚Äúhighly formal relationship between [him], God and the devil, under a dominant legal metaphor, employing the ideas of landed property and usurpation.‚ÄùStampfer 1970, p. 243. =Prosody= The accentuation in this sonnet is said to violate poetic principles.Winters 1967, p. 75. In the sixth line, ‚Äúthe language had to be deformed in order to fit the line into a pentameter pattern.‚ÄùWinters 1967, p. 75. The fact that Donne often violates the poetic form might be due to his ‚Äúrelative unawareness of the nature and importance of sound.‚ÄùWinters 1967, p. 75. It may also be observed, that the lines in the final couplet are hendecasyllabic (that is, there are eleven syllables in a line); ‚Äú[t]he addition of me to the end of each line breaks the meter and spoils the rhyme.‚ÄùColes 2015, p. 921. However, there is a possible explanation for that ‚Äì two of the enjambments in the poem (in its beginning and in the middle) ‚Äúare also completed by the same word: I resign/Myself (1 and 2) and I betrayed/Myself,‚Äù (7 and 8) and thus they both have corresponding elements in the other part of the poem.Coles 2015, p. 921. Analysis and interpretation =Themes= It is noted that the theme of abandonment by God is scarcely expressed in the Holy Sonnets.Denonain 1956, p. 151. It never becomes a central theme, with the exception of ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles.‚ÄùDenonain 1956, p. 151. The main concern of this sonnet is ‚Äúthe problem of election.‚ÄùLewalski 1973, p. 266. The speaker sets forth a variety of titles, which suggest that he tries to appeal to God through ‚Äúconventional submission‚Äù (giving a ‚Äúfacile and general‚Äù catalogue of sins and debts).Sicherman 1971, p. 85. However, in the sestet which follows, the speaker realizes that Satan has gained control instead.Lewalski 1973, p. 266. The speaker begins to fear that he might not be one of the elect.Lewalski 1973, p. 266. Although ‚Äúhe belongs to God by right,‚Äù he still feels that ‚ÄúGod has abandoned him and only the Devil seeks him.‚ÄùReeves 1952, p. 100. The divine presence is distant and unfelt.Stampfer 1970, p. 244. The sestet of the poem ‚Äúimplies a state of warfare between God and Satan.‚ÄùBlanch 1974, p. 479. The speaker there becomes ‚Äúmore emotional,‚Äù being ‚Äúindignant‚Äù at both sides respectively ‚Äì Satan for having ‚Äúthe audacity to usurp [him],‚Äù and God for refusing to act on his behalf.Ray 1990, pp. 38-39. Being tortured by the fear that his fate is contingent upon God‚Äôs whims, and that he may not have a place in the divinely ordered scheme,Blanch 1974, p. 479. the speaker in the closing lines despairs and blames God,Yearwood 1982, p. 212. putting ‚Äúall the responsibility on [Him].‚ÄùMarotti 1986, p. 255. Thus, lines 12-13 can be considered ‚Äútheologically controversial,‚Äù as the speaker ‚Äúthreatens God with his indifference to him.‚ÄùSpurr 1991, p. 171. The poem seems to end ‚Äúnot on a note of confidence even in the possibility of God‚Äôs gift of grace, but in sure knowledge of the perverse possessiveness of the Devil.‚ÄùSpurr 1991, p. 171. =The speaker= As Due By Many Titles presents ‚Äúa religious self who oscillates uneasily between coherence and incoherence.‚ÄùDerrin 2013, p. 147. The speaker feels helpless against the conflict between God and the Devil.Guibbory 2015, p. 82. Even though he is responsible for his own sins, it does not mean that he is responsible for his salvation.Guibbory 2015, p. 82. This expresses a Calvinist sense of human depravity ‚Äì the irresistible power of God‚Äôs grace cannot be earned or merited.Guibbory 2015, p. 82. ‚ÄúWhether the speaker is claiming salvation on the basis of an achieved condition or throwing himself on God‚Äôs mercy‚Äù is not certain, and the same tension may be also found in other Holy Sonnets.Strier 1989, p. 368. In the context of the development of the poem, it has been noted that the speaker‚Äôs role ‚Äúmoves from passive acceptance and praise of God‚Äôs actions for all mankind to active, desperate appeal for God to act again in his own, individual behalf.‚ÄùWall 1976, p. 192. In the octave, the first four lines function as a ‚Äúremembering of the salvation history,‚Äù and the second part of the octave which follows ‚Äúshift[s] to the present tense to describe in Biblical terms the speaker‚Äôs understanding of his relationship with God.‚ÄùWall 1976, p. 193. In general, the octave ‚Äúspeaks not just for the individual persona, but also generally and symbolically for all mankind,‚Äù whereas the speaker of the sestet is more personal, becoming a despaired individual who fears that ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs reconciliation with mankind may not include him.‚ÄùWall 1976, pp. 193-194. Due to this ambiguity, the speaker remains caught between two different temporalities.St. Hilaire 2017, p. 597. It disables him from ‚Äúconstructing a clear, future-tense narrative of his own salvation ‚Äì or, significantly, of his damnation.‚ÄùSt. Hilaire 2017, p. 597. Connections with other sonnets \\\\- ‚ÄúThou Hast Made Me,‚Äù (Sonnet I), as well as ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles,‚Äù both prevent the readers or the speaker from ‚Äúmaking an easy division between decree and experience.‚ÄùSt. Hilaire 2017, p. 597. The speaker‚Äôs temporal experience is strictly connected to the eternal capabilities of God.St. Hilaire 2017, p. 597. Due to an unresolved ambiguity, the speaker ‚Äúseems not to know whether to ask about the decree or the process.‚ÄùSt. Hilaire 2017, p. 597. \\\\- A major part of the sonnet that precedes ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles,‚Äù namely ‚ÄúThou Hast Made Me,‚Äù expands upon themes of death and damnation as well as sin and redemption.Ricks 1988, p. 190. It reveals the speaker‚Äôs ‚Äúconsciousness of sin, his susceptibility to Satan‚Äôs temptations, his terror at the thought of damnation, and his prayerful petition for God‚Äôs mercy through Christ.‚ÄùRicks 1988, p. 190. \\\\- A similar emotion of anxiety arising from the fear of being rejected by God is also present in ‚ÄúO, My Black Soul‚Äù (Sonnet IV).Papazian 2003, p. 83. This feeling emerges from the speaker‚Äôs fear that God may not choose him, leaving him vulnerable to the clutches of Satan, to remain reprobate for eternity.Papazian 2003, p. 83. In the case of the fourth sonnet, the speaker recognizes his own sinfulness and yearns for the grace that only God is able to give.Papazian 2003, p. 83. \\\\- The sonnet appears to be a plea to be possessed fully by God, but in fact, it is rather a ‚Äúdesperate attempt‚Äù to leave a mark of the speaker‚Äôs presence visible for the Maker.Fish 1990, p. 242. The same desperation has also been noted in ‚ÄúIf Faithful Souls.‚Äù (Sonnet VIII) Fish 1990, p. 242. \\\\- The first two lines of the poem ‚ÄúSpit In My face‚Äù (Sonnet XI) can be considered a ‚Äúre-signing‚Äù (the rewriting and resigning) of the speaker‚Äôs intentions towards God, which he announced already in ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles.‚ÄùAsals 1979, p. 130. \\\\- Both ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles‚Äù and ‚ÄúBatter My Heart‚Äù (Sonnet XIV) suggest that ‚Äúsin is something that happens to the sinner rather than something he does.‚ÄùSkulsky 1992, pp. 116-117. \\\\- ‚ÄúBatter My Heart‚Äù is said to share similar images of captivity and liberation with ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles,‚Äù where the speaker ‚Äúcomplains that he has been usurped by the devil and begs for God to rise and [‚Ä¶] fight‚Äù for his creature.Skouen, p. 167. \\\\- ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles‚Äù brings to mind ‚ÄúBatter My Heart,‚Äù in that ‚Äúthe conviction of ravishment by Satan‚Äù in the former underlines the speaker‚Äôs request for ravishment by the Trinity in the latter.Spurr 1991, p. 171. \\\\- Sonnet II also connects with ‚ÄúBatter My Heart‚Äù in terms of structure. Both sonnets reverse the typical movement in which elements opposed in the beginning are resolved at the end.Bellette 1975, p. 330. \\\\- Both ‚ÄúAs Due By Many Titles‚Äù and ‚ÄúFather, Part Of His Double Interest‚Äù (Sonnet XVI) use financial and legal terminology to describe the speaker‚Äôs relationship with God.G≈Çadkowska 2018, pp. 77-78.

He is CEO and owner of USG Security Ltd., a UK-based firm specializing in crisis management and litigation support, and WSLM, a real estate management company. He is a family friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biography Soriano was born in Argentina and immigrated to Israel as a young man. He served in the Israel Defense Forces as an intelligence officer, and later moved to London. On October 3, 2002, Soriano set up an international security company called the Universe Security Group, based in London, jointly owned with Guy Nagar and Yitzhak Molcho, who received about half of the company's shares. The company's board of directors also included Nahum Admoni, who served as the Director-General of the Mossad from 1982 to 1989, and Uri Sagi, former head of the Military Intelligence Directorate, and Albert Raes, Former Director of the Belgian State Security Service (VSSE) from 1977-1990. In 2004, Universe Security Group was appointed by the AMP (Panama Maritime Association) as a RSO (Recognized Security Organization) to certify ship security plans in accordance with the ISPS (International Ship and Port Facility Security) code. In 2007, Soriano and Universe Security Group were involved in a trade deal to sell three Bell 212 helicopters, which served the Spanish Fire Department, to the Georgian Ministry of Defense through the mediation of Gal Hirsch, a former Israeli brigadier general, while Hirsch served as an adviser to the Georgian Defense Minister. Between 2008 and 2011, Soriano was hired by billionaire entrepreneur Ruth Parasol and her then-husband Russ DeLeon to help resolve a criminal investigation that took place against them in the United States, for violating the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. Following Soriano's involvement, Parasol's company, PartyGaming, eventually entered a non- prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. In 2010 Soriano set up a new company called USG Security, which replaced Universe Security Group. The company \\"provides security, intelligence and investigation services to private and corporate clients in the UK and around the world\\", according to its website. In 2013, Soriano founded \\"Walter Soriano London Management\\" (\\"WSLM\\", \\"WS London Management Limited\\"), a real estate company based in London. Soriano owns or co-owns other companies, including \\"Tov 7\\", \\"Tov 77\\", \\"Crossroads Property 2\\" and \\"London Western Ranch\\", companies that are engaged in real estate development and management in the UK. He was also previously the owner of \\"Football Universe Limited\\" and acted as Diego Maradona's official European representative. In June 2019, it was reported that Soriano was asked to participate voluntarily in a closed-door hearing by the United States Senate on Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election. However, the Senate's intelligence committee's report eventually concluded that Soriano introduced Russian businessmen Oleg Deripaska and Dmitri Rybolovlev to Israeli company Psy Group for private projects, and found no connection to the US elections. In March 2020, Soriano founded the Anti- Cyberbullying Association in the UK. According to its website, the association is \\"working (together) to end cyberbullying\\" through legislation and regulation. In May 2020, Soriano joined the board of directors of PAVOCAT, a company that provides anti-corruption services to companies and governments. Links to Prime Minister Netanyahu In 2000, Soriano was one of the founders of an association commemorating the name and memory of Jonathan Netanyahu, brother of Benjamin Netanyahu, who was killed in Operation Entebbe. That same year, Soriano produced \\"Yoni\\", a film about Jonathan Netanyahu's life, directed by Semion Vinokur. The film incorporated archived materials from various sources, including the IDF video archives, the IDF spokesman archives, and the Netanyahu family.\\"Walter Soriano Productions\\" produced a film about Jonathan Netanyahu. see: After Netanyahu lost the elections to Ehud Barak in 1999, he temporarily retired from politics and went into private business. During that time, according to Soriano, he worked with Netanyahu on a number of high-tech ventures in the United States. In 2002, Soriano recruited Netanyahu for paid lectures at fundraising evenings held in Mexico City for the \\"Lev Malka Organization\\", which helps patients from low-income families. The story was published by Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, which claimed that Netanyahu was paid $180,000 for two days of work. Soriano confirmed to the newspaper that while living in Jerusalem, he had close ties with Netanyahu and that their relationship was based on ‚Äúyears of deep friendship, devoid of any external interests‚Äù. According to an affidavit to the court by Doron Stempler, which was filed as part of a lawsuit filed by Soriano against Raviv Drucker, in 2006 Soriano initiated a meeting between Netanyahu and Mexican businessman Alonso Ancira. Ancira purchased the inactive Timna Valley copper mines in southern Israel during Netanyahu's tenure as head of the opposition in the Israeli parliament. Stampler claims his company was hired by Soriano to conduct a security survey of the assets of a large Mexican company, owned by Ancira. \\"I remember that in that conversation and to impress me, Mr. Soriano told me that Mr. Ancira had purchased the Timna mines and wants to restart production. ... Soriano reiterated - perhaps to impress me - that Mr. Netanyahu is a partner in the project, thus explaining his expectation that government ministries will not pile difficulties on the project.\\" Representatives of both Netanyahu and Soriano denied the claims and called the affidavit \\"false\\". In early 2018, Police Commissioner Roni Alsheikh was interviewed by Israeli journalist Ilana Dayan. In the interview, Alsheikh said, among other things, that private investigators are gathering information against Lahav 433 officers involved in investigating Netanyahu's cases. Media reports, starting with Raviv Drucker on Israeli Army Radio, raised the possibility that Walter Soriano was behind this activity, which both Soriano and Netanyahu denied. Netanyahu added that he has not met Soriano or talked to him since 2010. No proof of Soriano‚Äôs involvement was ever published. Defamation suits In February 2018, Soriano filed a ILS500,000 defamation claim against Israeli Journalist Raviv Drucker, and in May 2019 filed a second claim for ILS580,000 against Drucker, together with the website HaAyin HaShevi'it, journalist Oren Persico and editor Shuki Tausig, claiming all four have been coordinating to publish stories to harm his reputation. In October 2019, Soriano sued Twitter in Dublin for defamation in order to \\"stop false and malicious allegations about him online\\". In an interview for the Daily Telegraph in 2020, he stated that he plans to sue Google. Personal life Soriano became an observant Ultra-Orthodox Jew. Between 2000 and 2004, he lived in Jerusalem and studied Torah with Rabbi Moshe Shapira. He then returned to live in the Golders Green neighborhood of London. His wife, Aviva, made contributions to the Jewish preacher Yemima Mizrahi and the Hidabrut organization in London. Soriano gives over $1 million to charity every year, supporting orphans, widows and wounded soldiers in Israel, as well as synagogues in Israel and in the UK and cancer research institutes. In London, he opened a synagogue named after Rabbi Shapira and in his memory.
