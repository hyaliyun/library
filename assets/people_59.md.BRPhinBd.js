Foster served in the state constitutional convention, and was elected to the State Senate. He was elected as mayor of Los Angeles in 1856, and later elected for four terms to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Early life and education Foster was born in Machias, Maine, December 17, 1820. He graduated from Yale College in 1840. Career He taught at a private academy in the South. In 1845 at age 25, he headed for California, like many other young single men, via El Paso and Santa Fe. While in Santa Fe, Foster was hired by Quartermaster Wm. M.D. McKissack to be an interpreter for the Mormon Battalion of Volunteers, then on its way to California as part of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War forces sent to California. He related his experience of being hired in his 1887 presentation, 'Reminiscences: My First Procession in Los Angeles March 16, 1847.' He acted unofficially as an additional guide. See page 48. In the stormy period when California was under US military rule after the defeat of the Mexicans, Governor Richard Barnes Mason appointed the 26-year-old Foster alcalde (mayor) of Los Angeles to replace the dissolved ayuntamiento (government) of the Mexicans. For this reason, Foster often has been referred to as the first American mayor of the city. He served as alcalde from January 1, 1848 to May 21, 1849. For the remainder of that year, or until the city came under United States jurisdiction in 1850, Foster served as prefect. Mason appointed Jos√© del Carmen Lugo, a prominent and mature Californio, as mayor following Foster. Marriage and family During his early years in Los Angeles, Foster made a marriage important to his standing in the community. He met and married Mar√≠a Merced Lugo, one of the sisters of Jos√© del Carmen Lugo above. Their father was a prominent Californio landowner. The Fosters had five children together. Foster was elected a member of the 1849 California Constitutional Convention, which met in Monterey. The group framed the state Constitution and petitioned Congress for admission of California into the United States. Political career Foster achieved his first political office after statehood in 1850, when he was elected to the Los Angeles Common Council for a one-year term. In 1851 he was elected California state senator from Southern California, and served two years. In 1854, Foster was elected mayor of Los Angeles. He is credited with authorizing construction of the first public school in Los Angeles.Supervisor Stephen Clark Foster , Los Angeles County, accessed 26 Jun 2010Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials: 1850--1938, Compiled under Direction of Municipal Reference Library City Hall, Los Angeles, March 1938 (Reprinted 1966) Los Angeles was then said to be the toughest frontier town in the United States. It had a diverse population with simmering tensions after the war, as well as a \\"disorderly element\\". The surrounding territory was overrun by bandits driven from the gold mines of northern California southward into the cattle ranching counties. Numerous gamblers and criminals drifted into the city to escape the vigilantes of San Francisco. Mayor Foster, like most of the city's prominent citizens, was a member of the local vigilance committee and of the Los Angeles Rangers, the mounted body of volunteer police. In early 1854, Foster resigned his official position to lead a lynching mob. After the lynching, the people held a special election and returned Foster to office for the remainder of his regular term. Foster was re-elected mayor in 1856. He resigned Sept. 22, 1856, to act as executor for the large estate of his brother-in-law, Colonel Isaac Williams. Foster next served as a supervisor on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for four terms. He was elected in 1856, 1858 and 1859. In 1857 he replaced Jonathan R. Scott, who resigned as county supervisor in March of that year. Historian Foster documented the history of California under the rule of Mexico in articles published by the Southern California Historical Society. In 1888 he wrote A Sketch of Some of the Earliest Pioneers of Los Angeles and Reminiscences: My First Procession in Los Angeles March 16, 1847. At Forefather's Day celebrations on December 21, 1886, Foster read a paper about yankee pioneers, titled First New Englanders Who Came to Los Angeles, which The Los Angeles Times stated was a \\"historically valuable paper.\\" Death He died in 1898 and his funeral was held in Downey, California.

Gabriel Gruber, S.J. Gabriel Gruber, S.J. (May 6, 1740 ‚Äì April 7, 1805) was the second Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Russia. Early years and education Gabriel Gruber, born in Vienna, became a Jesuit at the young age of 15, in 1755 and did most of his formation and studies in Austria: Latin and Greek in Leoben (1757‚Äì1758), theology, philosophy and mathematics in Graz (1758‚Äì60), languages in Vienna (1760‚Äì61), mathematics in Trnava, Slovakia (1761‚Äì62), and again theology in Vienna (1763‚Äì67). In 1766, he was ordained priest in Graz.  The engineer Gruber was an expert in hydrotechnology and architecture, and had also a basic knowledge of navigation and the history of seamanship.Kaiser Karl der Sechste, a battleship model by Gabriel Gruber kept in the Maritime Museum in Piran In early life, Gruber was a fanatical builder of model ships, and some of the teaching materials at the School of Mechanical Engineering were naval models of his that were made at the school between 1774 and 1783. Before being included in the Maritime Museum of Piran collection, these models were kept in the National Museum in Ljubljana. Some of Gruber's other workshop models had been in Pula, Croatia, but disappeared during the withdrawal of the Italian Army in 1943. Other Gruber models exhibited in the Maritime Museum are the Venetian battle galleon, the lagoon cargo galleon, the corvette, the schooner and a framework used during ship construction. In 1768, he moved to Ljubljana, where he since 1769 taught mathematics, mechanics, hydraulics and engineering at the School of Mechanical Engineering in Ljubljana (German: Laibach). The school taught classes in shipbuilding, port devices and structures, and Gruber's wish was to build a dockyard nearby. That enterprise proved to be prohibitively expensive. From 1772 until 1781 Gruber was the director of the navigation direction in Ljubljana, which took custody of the improvement of navigation on the Sava, the Kolpa and the Ljubljanica. After the Suppression of the Society of Jesus by Pope Clement XIV, in 1773, Gruber remained as engineer at the court of Emperor Joseph II until 1784. From 1772 until 1780, the construction of the Gruber Canal was started upon his plans, to improve the outflow of water from the Ljubljana Marshes and thus to protect the town of Ljubljana from flooding. The works were carried out under his supervision until 1777, when he was replaced by Vincenc Struppi, due to large increases of the expenses and even doubts about his integrity. At the same time, he was the architect and builder of Gruber Palace ‚Äî a vast rococo edifice that was originally his mansion ‚Äî used for his research in physics and hydraulics. It had also an astronomic observatory. The palace was bought in 1887 by the Carniolan Savings Bank and has housed the Slovenian archives since 1965. Return to the Jesuits In 1785, Gruber went to Polotsk, a border city between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian Empire to rejoin the Society of Jesus and became a member of the Jesuit community in Russia. Gruber was an active engineer, chemist, architect, painter, mechanic and physician. Under his influence, the Jesuit College in Polatsk became a famous academy of technical science. He was influential in the court of Catherine the Great, and was close to her successor Tsar Paul I, at whose request he reorganized the technical training in the whole Russian empire. In 1800 Gruber became the first rector of the Aristocratic College at the Saint Petersburg State University. Superior General Living at Saint Petersburg, and being a close confidant of Paul I, Gruber often discussed with him the affairs of the Society, on behalf of Franciszek Kareu, Vicar General of the Jesuits in Russia. In 1797 he became officially the Assistant of Kareu and ultimately, after the death of the later, Gruber was elected Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Russia, at the Regional (Polotsk) Congregation IV (1802). That was just a few months after Pius VII had issued the brief Catholicae fidei (1801), giving approval to the existence of the Russian Jesuits and making the Temporary Vicar (Franciszek Kareu) 'Superior General for Russia'. Gruber expanded pioneering activities by opening several missions among the Germans in the Volga region (Saratov, 1803), Odessa (1804) and Astrakhan (1805) where schools and agricultural activities were developed. However, politically, problems were growing with Paul I as well as with the local bishop of Polatsk. Towards reunification In the meantime the movement towards reunion of the Jesuits was gaining momentum. In the wake of the French revolution political opposition of the Bourbon courts had weakened. In 1803 the Jesuits of Stonyhurst College in England were made members of the Russian Jesuit province. The 'Fathers of the Faith' an independent group of ex-jesuits received affiliation in 1805. Contacts were established with the ex-Jesuits of Maryland (USA). In 1804, the existence of the Jesuits was officially recognized in Naples and Gruber became 'Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Russia and Naples'. Plans were on to send an overland mission to China when Gruber died after an accidental fire at his Saint Petersburg residence on April 7, 1805.

He was appointed as a lecturer in history at the University of St. Andrews in 1909, aged only twenty-two. While at St. Andrews he introduced the subject of Scottish history into the curriculum.A History of Scotland, revised ed., Penguin, 1977 During the First World War, he served in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and was awarded a Military Cross. He was wounded in both the stomach and in the shoulder. In both cases he received innovative treatment. For the stomach wound (caused by a machine-gun) he was treated at a military hospital in Rouen. Sterilised water was dripped right through his stomach and he recovered well. The shoulder wound was received in the last days of the war. He nearly had to have his arm amputated but he opted for a new treatment in which the nerve was knotted. However, he never regained full use of his left hand and suffered considerable pain for the remainder of his life. He returned to St. Andrews after the war, before being appointed professor of modern history at Bedford College, University of London, in 1926. He was Professor of Scottish History and Literature at the University of Glasgow from 1930 to 1957. It was during these years that he wrote The Earlier Tudors 1485-1558 (Oxford University Press).

It is the administrative headquarters of one of the four administrative sub-divisions of the district and covers 119 villages.Bhiwani district Haryana Official website.Introduction Bhiwani district Official website. It is also a railway junction station. The city's main commercial hub is its Anaaj Mandi, which was built by Sir Aminuddin Ahmed Khan in the year 1937. The Mandi is unique in design as it contains both residential and commercial premises for the merchants around a large central open space. It consists of 104 shops or 52 'Jodas' (couplet) as it was popularly called. The tax-free Mandi in its prime gathered goods from far and near for trade and contributed considerably to the prosperity in the region. Another attraction of the town is the bi-annual Camel fair held in the months of January and July. The Camels come from Rajasthan and other areas of Haryana, making it a colourful and festive venue. The present economy is based on agriculture and trade. Loharu was the seat of the eponymous princely state of Shekhawati during the British Raj, Thakur rule was established in 1870; and an important reminiscence of that is the Loharu Fort, now a key tourist destination.  Etymology  Loharu at the edge of Punjab (BrL) in Shekhawati The town gets its name from the Lohars or blacksmiths of the town who were employed in the minting of coins for the erstwhile Jaipur state.Loharu Town The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 16, p. 170.  History  Rao Shekha, a Shekhawat rajput (sub-branch of Kachwaha or Kushwaha), was the founder of Shekhawati, who originally divided Shekhawati into 33 Thikana (also called a Pargana), each styled as Thakur with at least a 'kuccha' mud fort, some of which were fortified further with stone. After him, additional thikanas were granted to the descendants of subsequent generations. * Tosham Shekhavati Thikana, was granted as a thikana by Shekhawati ruler Maharaja Mukund Singh in 1870 to Kunwar Abhaya Singh, the son of Maharaja Raj Singh II. * Mahendragarh Thikana, was granted as a thikana by Shekhawati ruler Maharaja Mukund Singh in 1868 to Kunwar Sheonath Singh I, the son of Maharaja Raj Singh II. * Madhogarh Thikana and Madhogarh Fort were founded by Madho Singh I in the first half of the 18th century, when he placed the area under the control of Balwant Singh. The fort is named after Madho Singh I; \\"Madhogarh\\" literally means \\"the fort of Madho\\". * Loharu Thikana, Loharu was founded as 33rd Thikana in the year 1588 A.D by the Thakur Narhar Das, a direct decedent of Rao Shekha. Loharu was then a small village with a 'kuccha' mud fort and stayed as such until 1800 A.D. During This period two important battles were fought here. The first war in 1671 A.D, during the time of Aurangzeb, was fought between Thakur Madan Singh and the Mughal Governor of Hisar for Refusing to pay the Land Revenue. The other was fought between the then Thakur Kirat Singh and Thakur Baghwan Das Singh of Khetri who claimed Loharu as part of Khetri. Thakur Baghwan Das Singh was killed in this battle outside the Loharu Fort and a Chhatri was built as a samadhi in his honour at the place where he was cremated, which is located about 1 km from the Fort. The Loharu pargana thereafter passed on to the direct rule of Shekhawati and subsequently became the paragana under the State of Shekhawati ruled by Kunwar Arjun Singh (Son of Maharaja Raj Singh II) from 1870. The Thikana of Loharu was then granted to Kunwar Arjun Singh in 1870 when he received the town of Loharu from the British East India Company as well as from Shekhawati ruler Maharaja Mukund Singh as a reward for his services against the Jat rulers of Bharatpur. Around 1755, this area was brought under the Maratha Empire by Maharaja Khande Rao Holkar of Indore in 1792. Maratha Maharaj Mahadaji Shinde (Scindia) of Gwalior had conquered Rania, Fatehabad and Sirsa from Bhatti Rajput Muslims. Haryana came under Maratha Empire. Mahad ji divided Haryana in four territories: Delhi (Mughal emperor Shah Alam II, his family and areas surrounding Delhi), Panipat (Kernal, Sonepat, Kurukshetra and Ambala), Hisar (Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad, parts of Rohtak), Mewat (Gurugaon, Rewari, Narnaul, Mahendragarh). Daulat Rao Scindia ceded Haryana on 30 December 1803 under the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon to British East India Company's Company rule in India. Ahmad Baksh Khan was given the territory of Loharu by British for his services against Maratha.Loharu State The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 16, p. 169.Chapter 5: My Loharu Connection The Battle Within, by Brigadier Mirza Hamid Hussain, Pakistan Army 33. 1970. -.(ebook)The State of Loharu Indian States: A Biographical, Historical, and Administrative Survey, by Somerset Playne, R.

Daulat Rao Scindia ceded Haryana on 30 December 1803 under the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon to British East India Company's Company rule in India. Shekhawat Thakurs of Loharu are: ** Kunwar Arjun Singh (1870‚Äì1896) ** Rajkunwar Silahaditya Singh (1896‚Äì1926) ** Rajkunwar Vikramaditya Singh (1926‚Äì1956) ** Rajkunwar Nagaditya Singh (1956‚Äì1988) ** Shri Sahib Ranaditya Singh (1988‚Äìpresent) After the Independence of India in 1947, the state acceded to the Union of India in 1948. Many of the ruling family and the city's Muslim inhabitants re-settled in Lahore, Pakistan. However, the Thakur and his direct descendants stayed on, in India.  Loharu Fort  The 'Paragana' under the State of Shekhawati ruled by Thakur Arjun Singh in the year 1870. It was from this year onwards that 'PUKKA' construction of mud Fort and village started. Over the years of construction come to include an interesting blend of Architecture. The South-Wing of the Fort contained the 'DARBAR' and the 'SHEESH-MAHAL' or the ROOM OF THE MIRRORS which has MUGHAL/RAJPUT style details. The central part of the South-Wing contained a large Victorian Style Audience Chamber and Banquet Hall. The right side of South-Wing consisted of the 'JAMANA' Mahal along with the kitchens. The left side of the South-Wing were purely Mughal architecture and contained the 'SNANGHAR'(Baths). The east-wing at the time and was distinct from the 'Shekhawati Haveli 'Style. The Fort was in the hands of subsequent Thakurs of Loharu till 1971 when the Late Thakur Rajkumar Nagaditya Singh sold it to the Government of Haryana. Since these buildings were not lived in, all the constructions of the North-Wing and West-Wing had collapsed as was part of the east-wing. Only the South-Wing of the fort containing the 'ROSHAN-MANJIL' survives and that too in a very dilapidated State.  Higher and Technical education  There are a number of institutions of higher education located in the Loharu area. The Keystone Group of Institutions, an AICTE approved institution offering BTech and MBA courses from Rajasthan Technical University, is from the Loharu station. Loharu is . from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, (Pilani, Rajasthan). It is also home to Rani Jhansi Laxmi Bai Govt Polytechnic, located on the Loharu-Bhiwani road and the government P.G College on Bhiwani road, there is a women's PG collage in loharu, located in main Market, these offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses and is affiliated to M.D.U, Rohtak.

Many of these reflections were given as homilies to the congregation at St. Clare's Monastery in New Orleans, where he served as chaplain until the city's evacuation during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and where he later continued to serve as chaplain after the hurricane recovery. Fr. Ferlita was also a librettist for two operas, Dear Ignatius, Dear Isabel and Edith Stein, and was a co-author of The Parables of Lina Wertmuller. He lived the remainder of his life at the Jesuit seminary at St. Charles College in Grand Coteau, Louisiana.  Related links  * COMPANIONS, A play by Fr. Ferlita * John Ogilvie (1579-1615) * Fr.

He was the leading figure in the Revolt of the Earls, the last serious revolt against William the Conqueror. Birth Ralph was born before 1042, most probably about 1040 in Hereford, as not later than 1060 he attested, in company with other Bretons, a notification at Angers as son of Ralph the Staller. Inheritances He inherited the great Breton barony of Ga√´l, which comprised more than forty parishes. In England, whether by inheritance or by grant from the Crown, he held large estates in Norfolk, as well as property in Suffolk, Essex, Hertford, and possibly other counties. In some of these estates he certainly succeeded his father, but it is not known whether he obtained the Earldom immediately on his father's death. Up to 1074 In 1065 he was with Conan II, Duke of Brittany when he besieged Rivallon I of Dol, Lord of Dol, in the castle of Combourg. After the Battle of Hastings, he is found in February or March 1068 at William the Conqueror‚Äôs court with his father. Then in 1069 he routed a force of Norsemen which had invaded Norfolk and occupied Norwich, and he would later be created Earl of Norfolk and Suffolk, or of the East Angles, the Earldom being also styled, from its capital, 'of Norwich'. It was presumably this Ralph who on 13 April 1069 was with the King at Winchester and he witnessed, as Earl Ralph, a diploma in favour of St. Denis of Paris and a grant in favour of the Bishop of Essex. It is possible that Ralph defended Dol when the Conqueror besieged it unsuccessfully in 1074, although it is more likely that Ralph was in Dol during the revolts against Hoel II, Duke of Brittany and that William came to Dol in defense of Hoel. Ralph built a church in Norwich, in the new town, and give it to his chaplains; but there is no record of religious benefactions by him in Brittany. Marriage He married, in 1075 at Exning, Cambridgeshire, Emma, only daughter of William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford and his first wife Alice or Adelise (or Adelissa), daughter of Roger I of Tosny. Their offspring were: *William de Gael, succeeded his father as Seigneur de Gael. He claimed Breteuil after the death of his uncle William de Breteuil, but died shortly thereafter, according to Orderic Vitalis.Earls of Norfolk 1067-1075 (Barons de Ga√´l) *Raoul II de Gael, seigneur of Gael and Montfort. By 1119, he had obtained the honour of Breteuil in Normandy (his uncle William de Breteuil died 1103 without any legitimate issue). The Complete Peerage claims that his descendants in the male line continued to hold his estates in Brittany, acquiring Laval and Vitr√© in the 15th century with the marriage of the heiress of Montmorency-Laval, but such a male-line descent hasn't been traced. He had only one child by his wife, whose name is unknown, a daughter Amice (Amicia), She was initially betrothed to Richard, illegitimate son of Henry I by his mistress Ansfrida, but her betrothed died on the White Ship disaster in November 1120. She was then married to the King's ward Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, second (twin) son of Robert de Beaumont, Count of Meulan. *Alain de Gael, who went with his parents on the First Crusade and died in the Holy Land  Revolt of the Earls  In 1075 the king's refusal to sanction this marriage between two powerful families caused a revolt in his absence. The leaders were Ralph, his new brother-in-law Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford, and Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northumberland. The revolt was plagued by disaster. Waltheof lost heart and confessed the conspiracy to Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who urged Earl Roger to return to his allegiance, and finally excommunicated him and his adherents- Waltheof was later executed by William. Ralph encountered a much superior force under the warrior bishops Odo of Bayeux and Geoffrey de Montbray (the latter ordered that all rebels should have their right foot cut off) near Cambridge and retreated hurriedly to Norwich, hotly pursued by the royal army. Leaving his wife to defend Norwich Castle, he sailed for Denmark in search of help, and eventually returned to England with a fleet of 200 ships under Cnut and Hakon, which failed to do anything effective. Meanwhile, the countess held out in Norwich until she obtained terms for herself and her followers, who were deprived of their lands, but allowed forty days to leave the realm. Thereupon the countess retired to her estate in Brittany, where she was rejoined by her husband. Ralph was deprived of all his lands and of his earldom. At the time of his revolt, he was a land- holder in Whaddon, Cambridgeshire. This is according to the Domesday Book, which uses the name of Radulf[us] Waders. Ralph and Emma retired to her Breton lands. They left for the Holy Land, joining Robert, Duke of Normandy, on the First Crusade, and died circa 1101. Baron of Brittany For the rest of his life he remained a great baron of Brittany, with no interests in England. In 1076, having plotted against Hoel II, Duke of Brittany, he was besieged at Dol, and William came to Hoel's aid; but Ralph finally made his peace. In 1089 he attested the judgment in a dispute between the monks of Redon Abbey and the chaplains of the Duke of Brittany. He also attested a charter of Alan IV, Duke of Brittany, in favour of St. Georges at Rennes (1084‚Äì1096). William being dead, Ralph appears in Normandy c. 1093 as a witness in the record of a suit between the abbots of Lonlay and St. Florent. There is, however, no record of religious benefactions by him in Brittany. Crusade In 1096, accompanied by his wife and in the army of Robert Corthose, he went on the First Crusade. He was one of the Breton leaders who took part in the siege of Nicaea, after which he joined Bohemund I of Antioch‚Äôs division of the army. Both Ralph and his wife Emma died on the road to Palestine in the course of the Crusade.

Off-road walkers typically walk about and take two or three months for the expedition. Two much-photographed signposts indicate the traditional distance at each end. * Land's End is the traditionally acknowledged extreme southern point of mainland England.

According to a 1964 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was but in a 2008 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was . An online route planner in 2011 also calculated the quickest route by road as , estimating a time of 15 hours 48 minutes for the journey (this uses the A30, M5, M6, A74(M), M74, M73, M80, M9, A9 & A99) but the overall shortest route by road, using minor roads in numerous places and utilising modern bridges, is only about . This route is roughly as follows: Land's End, Bodmin, Okehampton, Tiverton, Taunton, Bridgwater, the M5 Avon Bridge, the M48 Severn Bridge, Monmouth, Hereford, Shrewsbury, Tarporley, St Helens, Preston, Carlisle, Beattock, Carstairs, Whitburn, Falkirk, Stirling, Crieff, Kenmore, Dalchalloch, A9, Inverness, Kessock Bridge, Cromarty Bridge, Dornoch Firth Bridge, Latheron, Wick, John o' Groats. Google Maps, on 2 August 2017, calculated the fastest route by car, from the Land's End Visitor Centre to John o' Groats as being 837 miles and taking 14 hours 40 minutes. It also showed a walking route of 811 miles, which it suggested would take 268 hours, and involve an elevation gain of 30,148 ft and an elevation fall of 30,272 ft.  Methods  There are many ways to go from Land's End to John o' Groats. Traditionally considered to be a walk, the route is now traversed in a number of ways, with cycling and multi-modal expeditions being particularly popular in recent years. Most trips are done by individuals or small groups for personal fulfilment. Some expeditions are organised as charity fundraisers, sometimes involving celebrities: examples include cricketer Ian Botham's 1985 walk and athlete Jane Tomlinson in 2003. In recent history the route has been used as a rite of passage by cyclists taking on the most iconic cycling challenge in Britain. = Walking = The first recorded end-to-end walk (actually from John o' Groats to Land's End) was undertaken by the brothers John and Robert Naylor in 1871. Since then the walk has been undertaken many times, more particularly since 1960, after a well-publicised road walk by Dr Barbara Moore. In 1960 the entrepreneur Billy Butlin organised a road walking race, which gave further impetus to the idea. Since the 1960s, walkers have mostly chosen off-road routes, using the growing network of long-distance footpaths. A classic account is from 1966 by the travel writer John Hillaby.Hillaby, J. (1966) Journey Through Britain Republished by Constable in 1995 Off-road walkers usually complete the journey in two to three months. There is a considerable choice of off-road routes, but all are much longer than the shortest road distance, usually or more. The walk is still undertaken by road walkers, often doing the walk, like Sir Ian Botham, for charity, or as a \\"challenge walk\\". They typically take a month or even less. Some walkers aim to complete the route piecemeal, perhaps over several years, to achieve the walk within the time constraints of a working life and before the possible health problems of retirement.  Routes  There is no continuous long-distance path from Land's End to John o' Groats. There are long-distance paths for substantial sections of the route, and where they do not exist walkers connect them by rights of way and minor roads. Most walkers broadly follow these routes: *from Land's End to Exmoor by the South West Coast Path; or by a shorter inland route through Cornwall and Devon by minor roads and paths, the Two Castles Trail and the towpath of the Grand Western Canal *across Somerset by parts of the Macmillan Way West, the Samaritans Way South West or the Limestone Link *to the Peak District either by **an eastern route using the Cotswold Way, the Heart of England Way (or the Severn Way), the Staffordshire Way and the Limestone Way; or **a western route across the Severn Bridge then by the Offa's Dyke Path, the Maelor Way and the South Cheshire Way *to the Scottish Borders by the Pennine Way *by St. Cuthbert's Way and a section of the Southern Upland Way to the Pentland Hills, then by ** a western route using the towpaths of the Union Canal and the Forth and Clyde Canal, then by the West Highland Way and the Great Glen Way to Inverness; or ** an eastern route across the Forth Road Bridge to Perth and Pitlochry, then by Glen Tilt and the Lairig Ghru to Speyside and the old Wade road to Inverness. *from Inverness to John o' Groats, either by **the John o' Groats Trail, a mostly coastal long distance route that is rough but walkable; **a route that is mostly on roads with a few stretches of coast walking; or **some walkers head north west from the end of the West Highland Way at Fort William using parts of the Cape Wrath Trail, then head northeast through the Flow Country of Caithness. However, this route is through remote country and requires wild camping. = Cycling = Official Road Records Association records: *Rider on a conventional bicycle: 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds, set by 40 year old Michael Broadwith on 17 June 2018 *Women's: Lynne Taylor (Lynne Biddulph), 2002, 52 hours, 45 minutes and 11 seconds *Mixed tandem: A Wilkinson & L E A Taylor (Lynne Biddulph), 2000, 51h 19m 23s *Men's tandem: 5‚Äì7 May 2015 Riders: Dominic Irvine and Charlie Mitchell.

The record for cycling from Land's End to John o' Groats is held by Andy Wilkinson, who completed the journey in 41 hours, 4 minutes and 22 seconds on a Windcheetah recumbent tricycle. A typical cycling time when not attempting shortest time is 10 to 14 days. James MacDonald set a record in September 2017 for cycling from John o' Groats to Land's End and back again in five days, 18 hours and 3 minutes. the success of the attempt had not been confirmed by Guinness. From 1 to 4 March 2010, David Walliams, Jimmy Carr, Fearne Cotton, Miranda Hart, Patrick Kielty, Davina McCall and Russell Howard cycled in a team relay from John o' Groats to Land's End to raise money for Sport Relief. The first tricyclist to complete the route was Alfred Nixon, champion of the London Tricycle Club, who in 1882 made \\"the first, and at present only, tricycle journey from John o' Groats to Land's End, a distance of 1007 miles, in a fortnight\\".Lincolnshire Chronicle 25 September 1883 p4. The current Road Records Association record on a non-recumbent tricycle is two days, 5 hours and 29 minutes ridden by Ralph Dadswell in 1992. Men's quadricycle. In the summer of 2012. Riders: Hugo Catchpole, George Unwin, Tom Bethell and Richard Nicholls. Time 10 days 15 hours. On a four-man recumbent bike weighing 114 kg. Several cyclists have completed the route on folding bicycles. The fastest reported completion of LEJOG on 16-inch wheel Brompton bicycles is currently that of Si Trickett and Stephen Brindle, between 22-29 April 2011. There have been several unicycle completions of the journey. The Guinness World Record for the fastest completion by unicycle is held by Roger Davies and Sam Wakeling, who rode (Land's End to John o' Groats) from 12 to 18 September 2009 in 6 days, 8 hours and 43 minutes. They rode large unicycles equipped with two-speed Schlumpf geared hubs.Event blog with details of the trip and certificates from LEJOG Association , Redwelly.co.uk The record for riding from Land's End to John o' Groats on a penny-farthing had not been broken since 1886, when Victorian cyclist George Pilkington Mills set it with a time of five days and one hour. Richard Thoday broke the then 133-year old record by completing his ride in four days, eleven hours and fifty-two minutes.( ) He averaged around 200 miles a day. He had undertaken the challenge to help raise ¬£10,000 for the charity BBC Children in Need. The oldest person to cycle from Land's End to John o' Groats is Tony Rathbone (UK, b. 10 December 1932) who was aged 81 years and 162 days when he completed the journey on 21 May 2014. Roger Anthony \\"Tony\\" Rathbone started his journey from Land's End to John o' Groats on 7 May 2014 with his friend, William \\"Billy\\" Skipper. They cycled a total of 1,526.46 km (948.5 miles) and were riding for a total of 79 hours 34 minutes. Guinness World Record In 2017 Amelia Sampson aged 22 months completed John o' Groats to Land's End in 14 days in her trailer towed by her parents riding a tandem. At the age of 4 years and 4 months, Rhoda Jones is believed to have become the youngest to cycle Land's End ‚Äì John o' Groats on 2 September 2018. Cycling on a trailerbike with her parents Katie and Tom Jones she completed the ride in 22 days, 3 hours, 26 minutes. Her sister Ruth Jones, aged 5, completed the journey before her and became the fastest on a trailerbike. On 3 August 2018, Joshua Moisey, aged 7 years and 2 months, became the youngest Land's End ‚Äì John o' Groats cyclist on a standard bicycle, riding his own bike alongside brother Reuben (10) and parents Alvin and Hiroko, and raising money for Alzheimer's Society. On 14 August 2020, at the age of 10 years 5 months, Evangeline Towers became the youngest girl to complete the journey on her own bicycle, covering in 110 hours 5 minutes over 22 days with her father and uncle, raising money for Save the Children charity. There are several annual mass participation cycle rides that go from Land's End to John o' Groats, the biggest of which is the Deloitte Ride Across Britain, run by Threshold Sports. The Ride Across Britain takes over 800 riders the full length of Britain, taking nine days and covering , with each rider covering an average of per day. Previous celebrity participants include GB rower and Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell and former England Rugby captain Lewis Moody. In April 2018, George and Beatrice Neville became the first people to cycle from John o'Groats to Lands End on Santander Hire cycles, better know as Boris bikes. It took the couple 18 days to complete. = Running = The record time for a runner to complete the route, as reported by the Land's End John o' Groats Club, is nine days and 2 hours, by Andi Rivett in 2002, although there is significant doubt about the authenticity of this record, as Andi Rivett took a whole day (equivalent to almost 10%) off the previous record, which was set by established ultra runner Richard Brown in 1988. The fastest known time with supporting evidence is by Dan Lawson who in August 2020 completed the distance in 9 days, 21 hours, 14 minutes and 2 seconds. Dan's record is widely regarded as the fastest known time by the ultra running community; there is a petition to have Rivett's dubious record rescinded. In July 2008, Dan Driver became the first to run the route solo, meaning he carried all his equipment with him whilst he ran it. He completed the run in just over 17 days. The current women's record of 12 days, 15 hours and 46 minutes was set by Marina (Mimi) Anderson from 16-28 July 2008. In August 2019 the BBC reported that Sharon Gayter had completed the run four hours faster, in 12 days 11 hours 6 minutes, still to be verified by Guinness. In July 2020 GB ultra runner Carla Molinaro set a new fastest known time of 12 days, 30 minutes and 14 seconds. Fred Hicks was an early record holder. He ran the journey between 20 and 30 May 1977 in 10 days 3 hours and 30 minutes. He ran this for charity, not aiming to set any records, and it was only later, when he was approached by the Road Running association asking if they could pursue the record with Guinness, that he became aware he had set a new record. On 12 July 2009 British ultramarathon runner Kevin Carr successfully completed the first ever attempt to run the route off-road, becoming the first athlete to run the length of the UK as a fell/trail run. Like Driver, Carr ran unsupported and solo‚Äîa format commonly known amongst fell runners as a mountain marathon. Carr ran the challenge as part of an event organised by Benumber1,http://benumber1.co.uk/lejog.htm an event that saw several top-level British athletes (mainly Olympians) completing the challenge. The event was designed to encourage school students to participate in sport and to realise the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, whilst raising funds for the British Heart Foundation. The run covered over footpaths, bridleways, canal paths, river banks, national trails, fields, moorland and mountains. Over 80% of the route was off-road, the route resorting to tarmac only when necessary to link two trails, or where a trail passed through a village/town. The run took 6 weeks 3 days and 17 hours (including three rest days). Factoring in the rest days, this run called for an average effort of just under a day, every day, for more than six weeks. In July 2011, a team of runners from Calday Grange Grammar School, Wirral completed a relay from Land's End to John o' Groats, becoming the first school to do so. They raised ¬£200,000 for Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool. In mid summer of 2011 Anthony Band from Surrey ran 1000 miles barefoot, all in aid for Help for heroes. Band took 29 days, running on average 36 miles per day. On 3 August 2014, Marie-Claire Oziem became the first female runner to complete the distance unsupported and solo. She pushed all her provisions in a pram and camped along the way. Her route consisted of both on and off-road sections. Oziem ran for the charity Mind, based in Taunton for its project Go Wild, Stay Well, which aims to support those with mental illness through the use of various green therapy schemes. She started her run on 23 June and finished on 3 August 2014, regularly running distances of over 32 miles daily. = By horse = The journey with a horse is generally completed north to south, starting in April to avoid the midges in the Highlands but also to benefit from warmer weather. Evelyn Burnaby was the younger brother of the famous English Long Rider Colonel Frederick Burnaby. Whereas the elder brother was famous for having ridden across Central Asia and the Ottoman Empire, Evelyn decided to keep his equestrian adventures closer to home. He set off in 1892 to ride from Land's End, Cornwall to John o' Groats, Scotland. Evelyn's journey was soon serialised in a popular publication, The Country Gentleman, and was published in book form the following year as A Ride from Land's End to John O' Groats. Communist John Richard Penistan rode his horse, Billy-a- Journey from Land's End to John o' Groats in 1948 (or 1930) taking him 56 days. He was the first person to do the journey with just one horse. Arthur Elliott, a veteran of the Great War, rode his horse, Goldflake, from Land's End to John o' Groats in 1955. In 2006 the mother-and-daughter team of Vyv and Elsie Wood-Gee rode from John o' Groats to Land's End. Elsie was 13 at the time. Former army officer Grant Nicolle continued the tradition by travelling from John o' Groats to Land's End in 2007 with Marv (solo and unsupported), taking 11 and a half weeks. Grant has published a book called 'Long Trot' through Amazon, documenting the trip. = Swimming = Sean Conway swam the complete route from 30 June 2013 to 11 November 2013 (135 days). On 31 August 2018 this time was bested by British endurance athlete Ross Edgely, who swam the complete route from Land's End to John o' Groats in just 62 days as part of his effort to swim around the entirety of mainland Britain. =Stand-up paddleboarding= The first person to stand-up paddleboard (SUP) Land's End to John o'Groats was Cal Major, between 4 May 2018 and 2 July 2018, a total of 59 days. Major completely the journey solo and without any boat support. Her route took her along the Cornish and Devon coast into the Bristol Channel, up the River Severn and by canals to Blackpool, by sea around Cumbria and the Mull of Galloway, across the Firth of Clyde to Arran, along the whole of the Caledonian Canal, and up the coast of north east Scotland. Fiona Quinn became the first person to stand up paddleboard (SUP) Land's End to John o'Groats on an inflatable board, between 21 April and 10 July 2018. Over the 81 day expedition, she spent just 35 of those paddling, waiting out bad weather in between. Her mainly sea-based route took her up the Cornish coast, crossing the Bristol Channel to Lundy Island and on to Pembrokeshire before she paddled over to Ireland. Continuing up the east coast of Ireland she cross back over the Irish Sea to the Mull of Kintyre, through the full length of the Caledonian Canal and up the north east coast of Scotland. She also became the first woman to SUP across the Irish Sea and the first woman to complete a LEJOG triathlon, having walked and cycled the route in 2017. = Wheelchair = The fastest time in a wheelchair was achieved in August 2009 by US Navy Pilot Rick Ryan: eight days, 10 hours and 9 minutes. = Skateboard = The record time to complete the journey on a skateboard is 21 days, achieved by Matt Elver, Charlie Mason and Lee Renshaw, who traveled around per day to raise money for charity. = Triathlon = Sean Conway (swimmer) became the first person to complete a length of Britain triathlon in 2013. He traveled between Lands End and John o'Groats three times, cycling, running and swimming the route. Fiona Quinn became the first woman to complete a length of Britain triathlon in 2018. She traveled between Lands End and John o'Groats three times, cycling, walking and stand up paddleboarding the route. = Motoring = Tony Wilding at Land's End off to John o' Groats Motoring events between the two extremities have been held since the first decade of the 20th century, when the Auto-Cycle Union organised a series of runs for motorcycles. In 1911, Ivan B. Hart-Davies became the holder of the final Land's End to John o' Groats record for solo motorcycles. Riding his 3.5 hp single-speed Triumph, he covered the in 29 hours, 12 minutes. As his average speed exceeded the then- maximum of 20 mph, further official record attempts were banned by the A. C. U. The Motor Cycling Club (which had been running the London to Land's End Trial since 1908, still held today, at least in name) put on an annual Land's End to John o' Groats Run from 1923 to 1928 which included cars as well as motorcycles. These events were also known as the End to End. In 2006, BBC Television ran a series of three programmes called The Lost World of Friese- Greene covering Claude Friese-Greene's 1920s-era road trip from Land's End to John o' Groats. The trip had originally been filmed using the Biocolour process, developed by Claude's father William Friese-Greene and the film had degraded. The original print of Claude's film was subjected to computer enhancement by the British Film Institute to remove the flickering problem inherent in the Biocolour process. In September 1983 rally and trials driver Dennis Greenslade from Cornwall created a new sole driver non-stop record drive from Land's End to John O'Groats and return using the newly released Audi 80 Quattro. The time taken was 24hours 32 minutes. Following this record achievement which also raised ¬£10,000 for three charities he established The Land's End - John O'Groats Association formed to authenticate all journeys between these two iconic landmarks. In 1984, Neal Champion covered from John o' Groats to Land's End in 11 hours, 14 minutes, on a Kawasaki GPZ750 Turbo. In 1984, Christian Conzendorf-Mattner accompanied by Dennis Greenslade covered the route from Land's End to John O'Groats‚Äîthere and back non-stop other than for fuel‚Äîin 31 hours 22 mins in a 1941 BMW 327/80. The record run was monitored by a team of journalists from a motoring magazine and is the current record for prewar classic cars end to end, non-stop, two drivers. The Land's End - John O'Groats Association awards this trophy to new record holders. On 17 September 1988, Andrew Frankel and Mark Connaughton drove from Land's End to John o' Groats in a standard production Alfa Romeo 164 in 12 hours 30 minutes, including stops for refuelling. In 1993, John Brown initiated the Land's End to John o' Groats Historic Reliability Trial, a race for vintage road vehicles. The race is held each December and is a tough, three-day rally for old and classic cars, built between the 1920s and 1970s. The route takes a long route, using remote upland roads of the west of England, Wales (during the night), the Pennines and Scotland. Medals are awarded in gold, silver and bronze categories. On 15‚Äì16 April 1997, Hugh Edeleanu drove the route in a JCB excavator in a time of 22 hours, 10 minutes and 30 seconds. In June 2001, Wayne Booth became the first person to do the journey by motorcycle without stopping; the 37-year-old completed the historic trip in 14 hours and 52 minutes, averaging 57 mph, on a modified 1,000cc Honda Varedero, complete with additional 74-litre petrol tank. The meticulously researched route of passed through just two sets of traffic lights and was completed within all highway regulations, law and speed limits. Booth and the dozen strong support team raised over ¬£1,000 for The National Childbirth Trust and Macmillan Cancer Relief. On 22 May 2011, Kevin Sharpe and David Peilow completed the first end- to-end run from John o' Groats to Land's End in an electric car over two days, using only charging stations available to the general public, in a Tesla Roadster sports car. Jonathan Porterfield and Chris Ramsey at Land's End in a Nissan leaf On 7 August 2011, Darren Whitehead & Tony Dwight travelled from John o' Groats to Land's End (including crossing the Welsh border) in 5 days using two ride-on Wheel Horse lawn mowers. They also raised money for charity during the trip which was named The Lawn Way Down. On 30 November 2013, Lucy Grogan, travelling on a BMW GS R1200 motorbike, and her father Martin Grogan, travelling in a Mini Cooper Works, travelled from Land's End to John o' Groats in 19 hours, leaving Land's End at 4:30am and arriving at John o' Groats at 11:30pm same day. This was in aid of Safe Haven Children's Trust and raised ¬£3,000 for the non-governmental organisation. In September 2015, Jonathan Porterfield and Chris Ramsey beat the record in a Nissan Leaf electric car, using the existing public rapid charger infrastructure to travel there and back. The route south took 28 hours and 38 minutes, and the return trip 27 hours and 46 minutes. They submitted an application to Guinness World Records to have the quicker time recognised as a record. Dr Jeff Allan and his son Ben Cottam-Allan having completed their journey from Land's End to John o' Groats set off for the return journey. On 7 October 2015, Jeff Allan and his son, Ben Cottam-Allan, beat the electric car record in a Tesla Model S completing the northbound route in 19 hours 45 minutes and the southbound route in 18 hours 53 minutes. Jeff prepared the route by cycling in May 2015. They hold the Guinness World Record for shortest charging time from John o' Groats to Land's End of 3 hours 44 minutes 33 seconds. On 21 August 2017, John Chivers completed the first journey by electric motorcycle (a Zero DSR) from Land's End to John o' Groats, then continued his journey to Orkney and finally to Skaw, on the island of Unst, Shetland. The journey from Land's End to John o' Groats took him four days to complete, breaking the journey up into ten parts, each stop requiring a charge of at least three hours. On 30 July 2017 Andy Maxfield from Inskip near Preston completed the journey from John O'Groats to Land's End on an unmodified John Deere X750 ride on lawn tractor. The 874 mile journey was completed in a Guinness World Record time of 5 days 8 hours 36 mins with an average speed of around 9mph. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk- england-lancashire-45127295/lawnmower-man-andy-maxfield-breaks-uk-speed-record This journey was inspired by his father James Maxfield who suffered from Alzheimer's for 13 years with the challenge raising around ¬£10,000 for The Alzheimer's Society. The journey was completed with a support team from John Deere and his two daughters Kathryn and Kaitlyn Maxfield. In September 2017, Tommy Davies and Tom Harvey completed the 841 mile journey in 9 hours and 36 minutes, the fastest time ever recorded between the two points on land, with an overall average of 86.7 mph. They used a specially adapted Audi S5 with an additional fuel tank and an array of equipment to avoid detection from the police and speed cameras. The trip was allegedly tracked via a GPS tracker and filmed, although the footage and data has not been publicly released, presumably in an effort to avoid possible prosecution due to the excessive speed involved. In April 2018 the first hydrogen powered fuel cell electric vehicle, a Toyota Mirai completed the journey. {{cite weburl=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/john-o%E2%80%99groats- land%E2%80%99s-end-hydrogen-fuel-cell-car Driven by Richard Bremner and Luc Lacey from Autocar magazine and Jon Hunt from Toyota they started the journery from Kirkwall in the Orkney's.

The current fastest journey by local bus (defined as in section 3 of the Transport Act 1980 to be a stage carriage service with stops within 30 miles) was set by Clive Burgess in September 2016. He travelled from Lands End to John O'Groats using 31 buses, in 3 days, 8 hours and 55 minutes. In June 2014, to celebrate completing his GCSE exams, 16-year-old Adam Mugliston travelled from Land's End to John o' Groats on 36 buses in four days, 10 hours and 44 minutes. In August 2011, James Aukett travelled from Land's End to John o' Groats on 31 buses in five days, 7 hours and 25 minutes. James undertook the trip to raise money for children's charity, The Children's Society. Richard Elloway, having completed the return trip using a senior bus-pass \\"without paying a penny\\". In 2008, Richard Elloway of Somerset claims to be the first person to complete the journey from Land's End to John o' Groats and back free of charge by local buses, using the English National Concessionary Pass (a free bus pass for people over 60, allowing free off-peak travel on local bus services throughout England) introduced on 1 April 2008, and the pre-existing equivalent concession for pensioners in Scotland. He completed the first leg of the trip in one week and six hours. The entire journey was completed in two weeks, 8 hours and 30 minutes. In 1954, Gertrude Leather travelled by 17 local buses from Land's End to London, at a cost of ¬£1 19s 6d (¬£1.97¬Ω), and the following year travelled from London to John o' Groats by 25 local buses at a cost of ¬£4 5s 9¬Ωd (¬£4.29).Leather, G. and Parke, J (1986) Home with the Heather Ian Allan The winter timetables offer a fastest route on land public transport of exactly 24 hours, departing Land's End car park at 13:34 on day 1 and arriving at John O'Groats ferry terminal car park at 13:34 on day 2. This involves a First Kernow route A1 bus to Penzance, trains to Penzance, Tamworth and Crewe to meet the London‚ÄìInverness sleeper train, then the following morning Stagecoach buses X98 and 77 via Wick to John O'Groats. On a Friday schooldays route 77 doesn't operate and instead there's a 177 which arrives John O'Groats nine minutes earlier at 1325 making it possible to do the overall trip in 23 hours 51 minutes. However, in the summer buses depart Lands End at 40 minutes past each hour (instead of 34 minutes every two hours) with an extended journey time to allow for traffic congestion making too tight a connection to the train in Penzance to be sure of completing the journey. Sample journeys checked 16 June 2019 =Hitchhiking= M. Clark and G. Beynon are the last hitchhikers recorded in the Guinness Book of Records for the Land's End to John o' Groats trip (17 hours 8 minutes). =Paramotor (motorised paraglider)= The first recorded journey by paramotor was by Andy Phillips, supported by a team of British Royal Marines in September 2000. The trip took a little over six days and was completed from south to north. The first recorded trip from north to south was by John Caston, Brian Pushman, Alex Heron and Henry Glasse in September 2009 and took five days. In July 2016 a group of four pilots completed the trip from north to south in 6.5 days. This included double amputee Cayle Royce, who became the first person to fly the route in a ParaTrike. = Golf = In 2005 Surrey-based golfer and member of the Kent Golf Society David Sullivan walked from John o' Groats to Land's End hitting golf balls all the way. He travelled the in seven weeks to be eligible for the Guinness Book of Records as the longest golf hole. He raised money for the Variety Club, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami Appeal, and the Orpheus Centre, a residential arts and learning facility for the young and disabled in Surrey. = Aeroplane = The fastest passage between the two points was made in 1988 by a McDonnell Douglas F-4K Phantom in a time of 46 minutes 44 seconds =In a straight line= On 17 May 2014 a team of four set off to complete Beeline Britain ‚Äì a journey from Land's End to John o' Groats in a straight line. This never before attempted route was completed in 28 days and required the two biggest sea kayak crossings ever completed in UK waters. *The first crossing went direct from Land's End to Pembrokeshire ‚Äì a distance of over 200 km which took 34.5 hours to complete. *The second crossing went direct from Pembrokeshire to Anglesey ‚Äì around 170 km and taking 24.5 hours to complete. The team then kayaked, biked and hiked the remainder of the route which went via: Isle of Man ‚Äì Dalmellington ‚Äì Glasgow ‚Äì Crieff ‚Äì traversing Ben Macdui the second highest mountain in the UK ‚Äì Lossiemouth ‚Äì across the Moray Firth ‚Äì Lybster ‚Äì John o' Groats. The project was devised and managed by Ian O'Grady. He recruited the Team GB Paralympian Nick Beighton, Adam Harmer, a professional kayak coach and University Lecturer, Tori James who was the first Welsh woman to stand on the summit of Mount Everest. Beeline Britain's aim was to raise funds and awareness for Blesma, the limbless veterans charity. The project gained full royal endorsement from the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, and has to date raised over ¬£20,000 for Blesma. The whole journey was captured by filmmaker Ian Burton for the feature documentary As The Crow Flies  Youngest and oldest  The Land's End‚ÄìJohn o' Groats Association presents the Jack Adams/Richard Elloway Trophy annually to the youngest person to have completed the journey other than as a passenger in a motor vehicle. Henry Cole completed the journey in June 2006, at the age of four; he cycled over 31 days. He started school in the following September, and was presented with the Jack Adams/Richard Elloway Trophy in January 2007. Sophie George is currently the youngest recipient of the Jack Adams/Richard Elloway Trophy. She completed the journey by bus and train in August 2016 at the age of two years and 10 months and was awarded the trophy in January 2017. In 2017 Amelia Sampson aged 22 months completed John o' Groats to Land's End in 14 days in her trailer towed by her parents riding a tandem. Reg Savill is the oldest person to complete the journey on foot (although in the reverse direction from John o' Groats to Land's End), at the age of 74.  Organisations  There are three organisations supporting people undertaking the journey. * The Land's End‚ÄìJohn o' Groats Association is a non-commercial organisation established in 1983 for \\"those who have completed the epic journey from Land‚Äôs End to John o' Groats, or vice versa, by any means in a single trip\\". * The Land's End John o' Groats Club, which is sponsored by the company that operates facilities at Land's End and John o' Groats, the end points.

They combine \\"an important cause with an incredible experience to help fund treatment and research for a cure whilst addressing the challenges for those affected by MS\\".  Scottish equivalent  Until Union with England in 1707, Scotland's equivalent of the phrase was often \\"John o' Groats to Maidenkirk\\", as Maidenkirk (Kirkmaiden) was traditionally considered Scotland's southernmost point, a trip. This can be found in Robert Burns' poem On Captain Grose's Peregrinations thro' Scotland and the song, The Lady of Kenmure: :From John o' Groats to Maidenkirk :You'll never find a truer :For loyal faith and dauntless deeds, :Than the Lady of Kenmure.

Unlike Bond's more famous character, Paddington Bear, Olga is a teller of tall tales in the style of Baron Munchausen. The typical plot of each story is that something fairly ordinary happens to Olga, and she gives her animal friends a wildly exaggerated version of events, subsequently revealed to be untrue by what the humans say. Bond's books were memorably illustrated by Danish artist Hans Helweg, who was also well known for his \\"pulp fiction\\" covers for Pan paperbacks.

The Northern Limit Line or North Limit Line (NLL) ‚Äì Î∂ÅÎ∞©ÌïúÍ≥ÑÏÑ† (in ROK) ‚Äì is a disputed maritime demarcation line in the Yellow (West) Sea between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on the north, and the Republic of Korea (ROK) on the south. This line of military control acts as the de facto maritime boundary between North and South Korea.Elferink, Alex G. Oude. (1994). Description The line runs between the mainland portion of Gyeonggi-do province that had been part of Hwanghae before 1945, and the adjacent offshore islands, including Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeongdo. Because of the conditions of the armistice, the mainland portion reverted to North Korean control, while the islands remained a part of South Korea despite their close proximity. The line extends into the sea from the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), and consists of straight line segments between 12 approximate channel midpoints, extended in an arc to prevent egress between both sides. On its western end the line extends out along the 38th parallel to the median line between Korea and China. Origins A US Government map showing where a North Korean territorial waters limit would be, when disregarding the north west UN Command islands, compared to the Northern Limit Line. 1959 North Korean map of South Hwanghae Province showing a partial demarcation line close to the UNC islands, which South Korea argues shows North Korean acceptance of the NLL as a whole. The 1953 Armistice Agreement, which was signed by both North Korea and the United Nations Command (UNC),Armistice Agreement, paragraph 13(b). ended the Korean War and specified that the five islands including Yeonpyeong Island and Baengnyeong Island would remain under the control of the UNC and South Korea. However, they did not agree on a maritime demarcation line, primarily because the UNC wanted to base it on or of territorial waters, while North Korea wanted to use . In August 1953, shortly after the entry into force of the armistice agreement, the South Korean Syngman Rhee Provisional government, which opposed the armistice agreement, attempted to attack the DPRK on the west coast, ignoring the agreement. Accordingly, the United Nations Command set up the \\"Northern Limit Line\\" of the West Sea so that the ROK Armed Forces would not attack Hwanghae Island, and this is the starting point of the Northern Limit Line. Press release note, 1960 Lee Young-hee After the United Nations Command and North Korea failed to reach an agreement, it is widely believed that the line was set by the UNC as a practical operational control measure a month after the armistice was signed, on August 30, 1953. However original documentation recording this has not been found. The line was originally drawn to prevent South Korean incursions into the north that threatened the armistice. However, its role has since been transformed to prevent North Korean ships heading south. A 1974 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) research report investigating the origins of the NLL and its significance, declassified in 2000, found that the NLL was established in an order made on 14 January 1965 by the U.S. Commander Naval Forces, Korea. An antecedent line, under a different name, had been established in 1961 by the same commander. No documentation about the line earlier than 1960 could be located by the CIA, casting doubt on the belief that the NLL was created immediately after the armistice. The sole purpose of the NLL in this original order was to forbid UNC vessels from sailing north of it without special permission. The report noted, however, that in at least two places the NLL crosses into waters presumed to be under uncontested North Korean sovereignty. No evidence was found that North Korea had recognised the NLL. While the NLL was drawn up at a time when a territorial waters limit of was the norm, by the 1970s a limit of had become internationally accepted, and the enforcement of the NLL prevented North Korea, in areas, from accessing significant territorial waters (arguably actual or prospective). In 1973, North Korea began disputing the NLL. Later, after the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the NLL also prevented North Korea from establishing an effective Exclusive Economic Zone to control fishing in the area. It is unclear when North Korea was informed of the existence of the NLL. Many sources suggest this was done promptly, but in 1973 Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth Rush stated, in a now declassified, \\"Joint State-Defense Message\\" to the U.S. Embassy in Seoul that \\"We are aware of no evidence that NLL has ever been officially presented to North Korea.\\" However, South Korea argues that until the 1970s North Korea tacitly recognized the line as a sea demarcation line. North Korea recorded in their 1959 Central Almanac a partial demarcation line close to the UNC controlled islands, at about three nautical miles distance, which South Korea argues shows North Korean acceptance of the NLL as a whole. Status The border is not officially recognized by North Korea. The North Korean and South Korean navies regularly patrol the area around the NLL. As North Korea does not recognise the line, its fishing boats work close to or over the limit line, escorted by North Korean naval boats. On 27 April 2018, North Korea and South Korea adopted the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula, which agreed that areas around the Northern Limit Line would be converted into a maritime peace zone in order to prevent accidental military clashes and guarantee safe fishing activities. =United Nations Command's position= The UNC emphasized its position on the border issue on 23 August 1999, stating that the NLL issue was non-negotiable because the demarcation line had been recognized as the de facto maritime border for a considerable length of time by both Koreas: The UNC insisted that the NLL must be maintained until a new maritime MDL could be established through the Joint Military Commission on the armistice agreement.NLL ‚Äì Controversial Sea Border Between S.Korea, DPRK November 21, 2002. PRC newspaper People's Daily However, a 1973 U.S. diplomatic cable, now declassified, noted that UNC protested North Korean intrusions within of UNC controlled islands as armistice agreement violations, but did not protest NLL intrusions as the NLL was not mentioned in the armistice agreement. South Korea wished to describe all NLL penetrations as \\"military provocations\\", but the U.S. saw that as a major problem for the U.S. position on the armistice agreement. In 1975 the UNC position was that North Korean fishing or patrolling south of the NLL, outside of the UNC controlled islands, was not justification for any coercive actions by UNC controlled vessels; the UNC would not participate in establishing an exclusive South Korean fishing zone. =North Korea's position= The disputed maritime border between North and South Korea in the West Sea:Ryoo, Moo Bong.

Other than this, North Korea did not explicitly dispute or actively violate the NLL until 1973. First, the North Korean negotiators at the 346th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission challenged the status of the line. North Korea followed this up by sending large groups of patrol ships over the NLL on about 43 occasions in October and November. North Korea states that it had not been informed of the existence of the line, which is now confirmed by declassified U.S. diplomatic cables, so it could not dispute it earlier. North Korea's official state news agency KCNA described the line as the \\"final line for stopping the defectors to the north\\" drawn to meet \\"Washington's self-justified interests.\\" On 1 August 1977, North Korea established an Exclusive Economic Zone of up to . It also attempted to establish a military boundary zone around the islands claimed by South Korea along the NLL; however, this claim was rebuffed. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, North Korea wanted to establish a special economic zone and international port at Haeju, their southern deepwater port, to develop alternative trade opportunities. However, with the NLL enforced, access to Haeju required shipping to travel along North Korean coast for , often within of the shore. This prevents the development of Haeju as a large international port. Since September 1999, North Korea has claimed a more southerly \\"West Sea Military Demarcation Line\\" (also called \\"Inter-Korean MDL\\"). This maritime demarcation line is an extension line from the land boundary equidistant from the north and south mainlands, with channels to the north-west islands under UNC control, claimed to be based on international law delimitation decisions.KPA urges U.S. and S. Korea to accept maritime demarcation line at West Sea. Korean Central News Agency. July 21, 1999. According to a 2002 Korean Central News Agency article the NLL violates the Korean armistice agreement and the 12 mile territorial waters stipulated by the UN Maritime Convention. The article claims the Northern Limit Line is a root cause of armed clashes, and by insisting on the line the U.S. and South Korean seek to use it to spark military conflict. An earlier article reported that at meetings of the military armistice commission in December 1973 and July 1989 North Korea noted that future clashes were unavoidable unless a clear Military Demarcation Line was drawn in the West Sea, and urging the U.S. to negotiate such measures. On December 21, 2009, North Korea established a \\"peacetime firing zone\\" south of the NLL in waters disputed with South Korea.N. Korea sets 'firing zone' along western sea border. Yonhap. December 21, 2009. For many years North Korea has sold fishing rights in the area of the NLL to Chinese fishing companies, which South Korea regards as illegal fishing. =South Korea's position= The South Korean position from the 1970s has been: * The NLL is an indispensable measure to administer the Armistice Agreement; * The NLL is in the approximate mid-position between the islands and the North Korean mainland; * North Korea acquiesced to the NLL until 1973, so implicitly recognized the NLL. In 2002 the Ministry of National Defense published a paper reasserting the legitimacy of the NLL, and arguing that North Korea's claims regarding NLL were groundless. The paper concluded that: * The NLL has been the practical sea demarcation line for the past 49 years and was confirmed and validated by the 1992 South-North Basic Agreement; * Until a new sea nonaggression demarcation line is established, the NLL will be resolutely maintained like the ground Military Demarcation Line, and decisive responses will be made to all North Korean intrusions; * Any new sea nonaggression demarcation must be established through South-North discussions, and the NLL is not the subject of negotiation between the US or UNC and the North; * North Korea's claims violate the Armistice Agreement and are not compatible with the spirit and provisions of international law. On October 4, 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il addressed the issue of NLL disputes in a joint statement: However the following South Korean President Lee Myung-bak rejected this approach, describing the NLL as a \\"critical border that contributes to keeping peace on our land.\\" South Korean academics at the Korea Maritime Institute argued in 2001 that the legal situation between the two Koreas is a special regime governed by the armistice agreement, and not usual international law such as the Law of the Sea. Consequently, the NLL is subject to political agreement between the two Koreas, rather than international law remedies. =The U.S. position= The United States government position, separate from the United Nations Command, is not clearly expressed. When asked about the NLL, United States government representatives usually refer questioners to the UNC in South Korea. In February 1975, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in a confidential cable, now declassified, that the \\"Northern Patrol Limit Line does not have international legal status ... Insofar as it purports unilaterally to divide international waters, it is clearly contrary to international law and USG Law of the Sea position.\\" Earlier in 1973 a \\"Joint State-Defense Message\\" to the U.S. Embassy in Seoul stated that South Korea \\"is wrong in assuming we will join in attempts to impose NLL\\", and the U.S. Ambassador told the South Korean government that the North Korean territorial sea claim created a zone of uncertain status with respect to the NLL. In November 2010, following the North Korean Shelling of Yeonpyeong, President Barack Obama said the U.S. stood \\"shoulder to shoulder\\" with South Korea and condemned the attack, but did not specifically address the NLL. =Buffer zone established= On November 1, 2018, a buffer zone was established in the NLL.http://www.tellerreport.com/news/--%5Bfile%5D-nll-buffer-zone--there-is-a- marine-corps--.BkJ1sMYnm.html Border clashes Clashes between North and South Korean fishing boats and naval vessels have frequently occurred along the NLL. As the waters along the NLL are rich in blue crab, the seaborne clashes have sometimes been dubbed the \\"Crab Wars\\". Incidents include: * First Battle of Yeonpyeong (1999) ‚Äì four North Korean patrol boats and a group of fishing boats crossed the border and initiated a gun battle that left one North Korean vessel sunk, five patrol boats damaged, 30 sailors killed, and 70 wounded. * Second Battle of Yeonpyeong (2002) ‚Äì two North Korean patrol boats crossed the NLL near Yeonpyeong island and started firing; after becoming outnumbered and suffering damage, the vessels retreated. * On 1 November 2004 three North Korean vessels crossed the NLL.

No casualties were reported. * Battle of Daecheong (2009) ‚Äì A North Korean gun boat crossed the NLL and entered waters near Daecheong Island, South Korean vessels opened fire reportedly causing serious damage to a North Korean patrol ship and one death.Kim, San (November 10, 2009).

The island, 38.04 km¬≤ in area, has a population of 147. The island can only be reached by boat as it has no airport. There is regular ferry service with Yakushima, which is about 15 km to the east. Travel time is approximately 1 hour. The islanders are dependent mainly on fishing, agriculture and seasonal tourism. The entire island is within the borders of the Kirishima-Yaku National Park. Geography Kuchinoerabu-jima is located south of Kagoshima. The island is of volcanic origin, and has an area of approximately with a length of and width of . The highest elevations on the island are , with a height of and , with a height of above sea level. There are numerous hot springs on the island. Relief Map Shindake Crater Eruption 2015 The island is an active volcano which has erupted several times during the modern period, including 24 December 1933, when several people were killed when lava masses buried several villages. In 1980, multiple explosion craters appeared along an north-south fissure on the slope east of Shindake. Shindake erupted again on 4 August 2014, generating a pyroclastic flow, but with no injuries or fatalities. The main crater erupted on the morning of 29 May 2015, prompting a level 5 alert level and the evacuation of the island. The island‚Äôs climate is classified as subtropical, with a rainy season from May through September. History During the Edo period, Kuchinoerabu-jima was ruled by the Shimazu clan of Satsuma Domain and was considered part of ≈åsumi Province. Following the Meiji restoration, it was administered as Kuchinoerabujima Village, which encompassed part of Yakushima. It is now part of the city of Yakushima, Kagoshima. Kuchinoerabu-jima is the last known location of missing American poet Craig Arnold, who was visiting the island in April 2009, doing research for a book on volcanos. Volcanic eruptions of Mount Shindake On May 18, 2015 Japanese scientists detected increased seismic activity and steam rising from the Shindake's crater, and on May 29, 2015 an eruption sent an ash cloud an estimated 30,000 feet (9,100 meters) into the sky. No deaths and only one minor injury were reported by the Japanese government. The island‚Äôs 140 residents were evacuated by Japan‚Äôs coast guard. Previous eruptions occurred in August, 2014 and in 1980. Shindake crater erupted on December 18, 2018, ejecting an ash cloud 2 kilometers into above cloud coverage. Thirty days later on January 17, 2019, Shindake erupted again, sending pyroclastic flows 1.5 kilometers to the southwest and northwest of the crater as well as an ash cloud 6 kilometers into the atmosphere.

In English it is sometimes called the Finnish Universal, as the Finns consider the breed capable of fulfilling all of Finland's horse needs, including agricultural and forestry work, harness racing, and riding. In 2007, the breed was declared the official national horse breed of Finland. The Finnhorse is claimed to be among the fastest and most versatile \\"coldblood\\" breeds in the world. In Finland, the term \\"universal horse\\" is used to describe the Finnhorse and breeds such as the Fjord horse that are relatively small with a body type that is heavy for a riding horse but light for a draught. There are four separate sections within the Finnhorse stud book, each with different goals: to develop a heavier working horse, a lighter trotter type, a versatile riding horse, and a proportionally smaller pony-sized animal. The combined breed standard for all four sections defines the breed as a strong, versatile horse with pleasant disposition. The average height of the breed is , and the most typical colour is chestnut, often with white markings and a flaxen mane and tail. The exact origins of the early Finnish horse are currently not known. Because the Finnhorse breed and its progenitors were the only horses in Finland for centuries, the history of horses in Finland parallels the history of the Finnhorse itself. The documented history of the distinct breed begins at the turn of the 13th century. Outside influences by many light and warmblood breeds were recorded beginning in the 16th century, making the breed larger and more usable. An official Finnhorse studbook was founded in 1907, producing purebred animals in significant numbers for many years. Due to mechanisation of agriculture and the dismantling of Finnish horse cavalry in the later half of the 20th century, the Finnhorse population plummeted from a high of just over 400,000 animals in the 1950s to a low of 14,100 in 1987. However, the breed managed to survive thanks to its popularity for harness racing and its versatility as a mount. Breed characteristics A founding sire, Jaakko (Tt 118), photographed in 1882 The breed standard defines the Finnhorse as a multi-purpose horse of average height, and sturdy conformation. The ideal Finnhorse is easy-to-handle, versatile, and combines strength, agility, speed and endurance. Finnhorses are lively, with both a reliable and alert temperament. The breed standard encourages a horse that is \\"honest and sincere\\"; eager to cooperate with humans, obedient, and willing to work. They are hardy with good endurance, robust health, and are generally long-lived. The breed standard describes the head of a Finnhorse as dry and the profile straight, not long or convex, with well-spaced, short ears. The neck should be well-shaped and not underslung or ewe-necked; the body should be on the long side, but rounded and proportionate; and the croup should neither be level nor with a too-high connection to the tail. Finnhorses are strongly muscled, with good bone, sturdy \\"dry\\" legs, and strong hooves. Finnhorses typically have thick manes and tails, and the legs have light feathering. The average height is . Pony-sized Finnhorses--under --exist as well, and are licensed for breeding in a separate section of the official stud book. Finnhorses have good gaits that are regular with elasticity, and relatively low, steady action. They are fast for a coldblooded breed, known as good trotting horses and used for harness racing. In addition to these general traits, there are four separate breed sections in the Finnhorse studbook, and a Finnhorse's overall conformation should be typical of the section in which it is recorded, though some horses are registered in multiple sections. = Colours = Over 90 percent of Finnhorses today are chestnut. Flaxen manes and tails as well as white markings on the face and legs are common in the breed. As of 2007, only a minority of Finnhorses are any color other than chestnut: 6 percent are bay and 1.2 percent black. Roans, palominos, buckskins and silver dapples exist in smaller numbers. The genes for other cream dilutions and rabicano are present in the gene pool. A distinctive sabino, non-SB1 pattern is moderately common, but is usually minimally expressed due to the selective colour breeding of the 20th century. A single white horse, registered as pinto and deemed \\"sabino- white,\\" has been recorded in the modern history of the breed. The number of non-chestnuts is increasing due to dedicated breeding for other colours, and as of 2009, a few dozen black and grey Finnhorses exist. SW1, one of the genes responsible for the splashed white markings, has been found in a number of individuals by genetic testing. Black is one of the rarest Finnhorse colours. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, chestnut in various shades was the prevailing colour of Finnish horses, making up about 40-50 percent of the breed, and bays, blacks and greys existed in much greater numbers than today: 34 percent were bay, 16 percent black, and the remaining 3 percent were grey, palomino or spotted. Wide blazes and high leg markings were rare, unlike today; bold markings became common only in the 20th century. The change came about through selective breeding. At the turn of the 20th century, when a nationalistic spirit was high, the Finnhorse began to be considered a symbol of Finland, and purebreeding became very popular. In addition, chestnut colour was officially chosen as an official aim for breeding as the \\"utmost original\\" colour of the Finnhorse, and named the \\"Hippos colour\\" after Hevoskasvatusyhditys Hippos, the name of the recently founded Finnish national horse breeding association that is now Suomen Hippos. Any colours other than chestnut were considered evidence of \\"foreign\\" blood, and the goal was to make the Finnhorse an all-chestnut breed. The breeding regulation of 1909 stated that no stallion \\"with coat of white, grey, palomino or spotted\\" could be accepted into the stud book. The popularity of bay and black Finnhorses dropped as well, and at least one mare was removed from the stud book solely because of her bay colour. Selective breeding combined with the export of horses in colours popular in neighbouring countries, especially bays into Sweden, and made chestnut the prevailing colour. In the earliest section of the first Finnhorse studbook, 105 of the stallions listed were chestnut and only 8 were bay. There were stallions of other colours as well, but they were not included in the first book. At one point, chestnuts made up more than 96 percent of the breed. Because of the vigorous colour breeding for chestnut in the early 20th century, combined with a genetic bottleneck resulting from the low number of Finnhorses that existed in the 1980s, colours such as grey and cream dilutions were preserved only by a few minor breeders. In the 1980s there were fewer than ten grey and palomino Finnhorses combined. All Finnhorse carriers of the cream gene today descend from a single maternal line, founded by the palomino mare Voikko (literally, \\"Palomino\\") who lived in the 1920s. While both cream dilution and black are rare, there are some known smoky blacks in the breed, the first of which was a filly foaled in 2009, identified as smoky black and confirmed as such by a DNA test in 2010. The filly is considered \\"if not the first ever, at least the first in a long long time.\\" In April 2010, a filly appearing to be a double cream dilute was born, sired by a buckskin and out of a palomino. She was blue-eyed and had \\"pink skin and very pale coat\\", and was later officially recognised as a double cream dilute. The roan colour is rare, and today is passed on via a single dam line that descends from the strawberry roan mare Sonja, foaled in 1936. As of 2010, only six confirmed roan Finnhorses exist, all descendants of a 1987 mare, Taika- Tytt√∂, great-great-granddaughter of Sonja. The second-to-last roan line died out with the passing of the 1981 stallion Jesper Jr, who had no offspring. Grey exists in one dam line, descending from mare Pelelaikka, especially through her maternal grandson E.V. Johtot√§hti 1726-93Ta, an award-winning working section stallion. The second last grey line died in 2010 with the 1988 mare Iiris 2275-88R, who had no grey offspring. The silver dapple gene survived for two reasons. First, it only affects black colour and therefore is \\"masked\\" in chestnuts. Second, when it does act on black and bay base coat colors, it produces a chestnut-like phenotype. Silver dapple bays were long registered as \\"cinnamon chestnuts\\", and silver dapple blacks as \\"flaxen-maned dark chestnuts\\". Breed sections Draught-type stallion Murron-Ryhti 3531 pulling a stone cart at a pulling competition in the 1930s, exhibiting the typical low, effective pulling stature of the breed. The Finnhorse stud book was created in 1907. Today it has four sections: the Working section (T; draught type), Trotter section (J), Riding section (R) and Pony-sized section (P) In 1924, the first split in the stud book was created, with the working or draught type () horses in one section, and the \\"all-around\\" or \\"universal\\" lighter trotting horses in another. In 1965, this all-around section was renamed the trotter section. Then, in 1971, this lighter horse section was divided into three parts: the trotter (), riding () and pony-sized () types. Today, the majority of Finnhorses are of trotter type. =Draught type= The working or draught type is the oldest of the Finnhorse types, and has had its own separate breeding section since the studbook was first split in 1924. Though the oldest of the Finnhorse types, it is rare today, with a total of only about 1,000 horses registered in the working section as of 2004. Draught- type Finnhorses are heavier and have a longer body than horses of the trotter and riding types. Though relatively small compared to other draught breeds, Finnhorses have considerable pulling power and can pull very heavy loads because of the breed's good pulling technique, with powerful take-off and a low, efficient body stature during the actual pulling. The Finnish Draught type is, pound for pound, stronger than many larger draught breeds. An average horse in draught work is capable of pulling about 80 percent of its own weight, while a Finnhorse can pull as much as 110 percent. In work horse competitions, the best Finnhorses can achieve even higher results, pulling more than 200 percent of their own body weight. A draught-type horse must pass two tests in the studbook evaluation: a walking test and either a pulling or a general drivability test. The points given for the horse's performance in these tests are added to those given for its temperament and gaits, resulting in the final workability score. The horse is also given a score for its conformation. In addition to achieving the minimum scores for both workability and conformation, stallions accepted for the working-horse section of the stud book are required to trot in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds. =Trotter type= markings almost kept him out of the studbook, but once at stud he proved highly successful, and became exceedingly influential in the breed, especially through his son Eri-Aaroni. The trotter type is the lightest Finnhorse. A trotter section horse should be of light conformation yet muscular, with a relatively long body and long legs. At the studbook evaluation, a trotter-type horse must meet the standards in racing results and/or in breeding value index as decreed by Suomen Hippos. A trotter's disposition is evaluated during the drivability test. However, type is not part of the studbook evaluation standard for trotters. The trotter type has existed as a separate breeding section since 1965, when the \\"universal horse\\" section of the Finnhorse studbook was renamed and replaced by the trotter section. While the total number of Finnhorses dropped during the 20th century, the popularity of harness racing turned Finnhorse birthrates around from the historical lows of the 1970s and 1980s. Today, approximately 2 000 Finnhorses are in training and 3 000 compete in harness racing. The official Finnhorse racing championship Kuninkuusravit began in 1924 and has been held annually ever since, attracting tens of thousands of spectators. The Finnhorse is slower to mature than lighter breeds, and thus usually enters harness racing competition at the age of four. However, its build withstands competition better than light trotters, and the breed's effective competition career can be very long. The Finnish harness racing bylaws allow Finnhorses to be raced from ages 3 to 16. For a \\"coldblood\\" breed, the Finnhorse is quite fast. The official Finnish coldblood record from 2010 is 19,9aly, was long held by the quintuple Finnhorse racing champion stallion Viesker., but was finally broken by Jokivarren Kunkku in 2015 (19,5x) The coldblood horse world record in harness racing was long held by Finnhorses, until in 2005 the record was broken by J√§rvs√∂faks, a Scandinavian coldblood trotter from Sweden. As of 2010, the official Finnish record for mares, and the world record for coldblood mares, is 20.2aly, held by the double Finnhorse racing female champion I.P. Vipotiina. The absolute Finnhorse speed record is 19.4aly, held by the stallion Sipori. As the result was not achieved from a win, the time is not an official Finnish record. Finnhorses have been so successful against other coldblood trotter breeds of Scandinavia, that by the 21st century, they have been admitted to Swedish and Norwegian races only by invitation. Some conformation flaws common in the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses is a tendency to trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels. =Riding horse type= Finnhorse stallion competing in dressage The riding horse section Finnhorse is a capable and reliable mount. It lacks some traits required for competing at the highest levels of international riding sports, but its combination of size and good temperament makes it suitable for both adults and children. To qualify for the riding section, a horse must carry itself well, and have a long neck, small head, sloping shoulder and well-defined withers. The body must not be too long. The universal Finnhorse breeding goals have made the breed of a lighter build, with longer neck, better gaits and fewer faults in conformation, allowing modern riding-type Finnhorses to work more easily on the bit. Even the temperament of the riding section animals appears to have become more lively. To pass the studbook evaluation, a riding type horse must either have placed in a Grade IV dressage or combined driving competition, or pass a dressage test; must pass a jumping evaluation and a ridability test, and possess clean gaits. Mares may be qualified solely on grounds of a ridability test and a movement evaluation. Despite the Finnhorse's image as a working farm horse, the breed was used as a cavalry mount from the 17th century until the end of World War II. After the mechanisation of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it was not clear if the Finnhorse would make the transition into a riding horse, even though the long use of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the job. The Finnhorse had a strong image as a harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported horses and ponies were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time. The Suomenratsut ry (SuoRa, or \\"Finnmounts\\") organisation was founded in 1974 to promote the use of the Finnhorse under saddle, and with the growing popularity of riding and the support of SuoRa, Finnhorses of riding type gained a foothold, though by the late 1970s, even SuoRa estimated that only about 300 Finnhorses were being used for riding. However, the popularity of harness racing and the breeding of trotter type Finnhorses made the breed lighter and faster overall, which also benefitted the riding section. In addition, the Finnish state horse breeding institute of Yp√§j√§ was founded in the 1970s, and was the first stud farm to breed and train Finnhorses for riding on a larger scale. Well-trained Finnhorse mounts from Yp√§j√§, seen in growing numbers in competition, added to the popularity and credibility of the breed for under-saddle use. After the slow beginning, the Finnhorse was increasingly appreciated as a riding horse. Today, over 5,000 are used for riding. Riding section horses currently are sought after while the trotting section suffers from oversupply. =Pony-sized type= Despite its small size, the pony-sized Finnhorse is not a pony, and possesses the same body proportion and movement as the larger sections. A pony-sized Finnhorse must measure no more than 148 cm (14.2-1/2 hands, 58-1/2 inches) at the withers or the croup. Both sexes are also required to pass either a drivability or a ridability test. The horse's pedigree is also evaluated, and uncharacteristically small individuals descending from larger- sized lines are not accepted. The horse should be proportionately small all over, and express all the qualities of a full-size Finnhorse. Especially thorough attention is paid to the pony-sized horse's character, obedience and cooperation. The pony-sized Finnhorse is suited to practically any use the larger Finnhorse is, with the exception of heavy draught work because of its smaller size and proportionally reduced strength. However, some individuals have been able to compete with and even win against full-size Finnhorses in work horse competitions. Many pony-sized individuals are cross-registered for trotter section breeding, as small Finnhorses can be equal competitors in harness against larger ones. In combined driving, the pony-sized Finnhorse's size is an advantage, allowing for greater agility. The section is popular for therapy and riding school use. Although its breeding section was created at the same time as the trotter and riding types, the pony-sized Finnhorse is technically the newest of the sections, as trotters and riding horses were bred as \\"universal horses\\" in a combined section beginning in 1924. The Finnhorse had been bred for larger size for centuries, and when the pony-sized breeding section was established, few pony-sized lines existed. The section remains the rarest type of Finnhorse, with only about 80 stallions and 420 mares accepted in the studbook as of 2010.  Studbook evaluation  To be registered as a Finnhorse, a horse must either have parents registered as Finnhorses, or be verified to be descended from at least three generations of Finnhorses. To qualify for the Finnhorse stud book as a breeding animal, a horse must prove itself by meeting or exceeding the breed standard set for various qualities: performance ability, conformation, disposition, and in some cases, quality of offspring. Any horse offered for the Finnhorse studbook must be at least 4 years old, a stallion or a mare, and registered a Finnhorse. The stud book evaluation board considers the performance of horses in their desired discipline: riding, driving, harness racing, or workhorse events. Horses to be registered in the stud book are tested for performance at the stud book registration inspection. With the exception of the trotter section, they are also evaluated on \\"type\\"; the suitability of the horse's overall build for the section for which it is offered. Individuals that do not qualify for the studbook on their own merits during the stud book evaluation process may be accepted later, based on the quality and accomplishments of their offspring. For this to occur, a horse's offspring are evaluated by their competitive history or their stud book evaluation, and if of high enough quality, their parent then is also granted acceptance into the stud book. Conversely, a horse may be removed from the studbook if its offspring are found to have any inherited flaw or condition. A stallion may also be removed if his offspring are clearly below the average level in competitive success or stud book evaluations. = Walking test = The walking test is given only to draught type Finnhorses and measures the horse's endurance while pulling a load. The horse tested pulls a load for , walking. The calculated time per kilometre must be no more than ten minutes to qualify as accepted. A horse qualifying with this time will be given four points. Extra points are given for faster times at the interval of 30 seconds, and the maximum points given is 10, for a time no longer than eight minutes and 30 seconds. = Pulling test = Finnhorse stallion performing in the pulling test with a measuring car. His breeder is allowed to sit on the car, an exception to the rules. Car pulling was part of stallions' studbook evaluation from 1936 to 1970. The pulling, or tensile resistance, test is also a test only for the draught type horses, and it measures pulling capacity in relation to size. The test is performed in several progressive stages, called \\"steps\\", with the load increased each time. The horse tested will pull a weighed sled on semi-rough sand. The friction between the sled and the sand is taken into account and is measured before the test. The sled is loaded according to the horse's weight; on the first attempt, the load equals 36 percent of the estimated weight of the horse; with each subsequent stage of the test, the load is increased by 6 percent of the horse's weight. The horse must pull the sled for at each weight. If the horse stops during a test and does not resume within one minute, or stops four times before reaching the required distance, the test is discontinued. Two points are awarded for every testing stage completed successfully, with a maximum total score of 20. The pulling style is also evaluated, and given 4 to 10 points. To pass the test, the horse must successfully complete pulls for at least five \\"steps\\". This corresponds to a pulling capacity of 60 percent of the horse's weight. An award of 20 points corresponds to 90 percent of the horse's weight being pulled. = Drivability test = The general drivability test is performed by trotter stallions. It is optional for draught type horses in lieu of the pulling test, and for pony- sized horses in lieu of the rideability test. The horse is driven by two different members of the studbook evaluation committee during this test, and asked to perform at a walk and trot. Its cooperation and disposition are evaluated on a scale of 4 to 10 points. The draught section drivability test, which evaluates disposition: adaptability, reliability, and calmness, consists of four parts, and 0‚Äì5 points are given for each. To pass the test, the horse must score at least one point for each part of the test, and its combined score for the test must be at least 10 points. The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while it is being harnessed and loaded, then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven. These parts often include regulation of the speed of the horse's walk, halts, turns around obstacles, and backing with a load around a corner. = Rideability test = In the rideability test, the horse is evaluated by a member of the studbook evaluation committee by being ridden at a walk, trot and canter. The horse's movement, balance and disposition are evaluated and given 4 to 10 points. The horse should express cooperation, gentleness, attentiveness, sensitivity to cues, and active effort. This test is required for riding-type horses, and optional for pony-sized horses in lieu of the driveability test. History Finnish horses and a horse-drawn tram in Turku, 1890 The ancestors of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts of burden in every aspect of life from antiquity well into the 20th century. The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistics suggest that horse has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age (400-800 CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and it can be argued that this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20th century, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals. =Early history= Although multiple hypotheses exist on the origins of the horse in Finland, an indigenous wild horse origin is thought improbable, as significant numbers of domesticated horses were imported from earliest times. The Finnhorse is most likely descended from a northern European domestic horse. One theory suggests that horses arrived from the west, brought to what today is western Finland by the Vikings during the Viking Age, circa 800‚Äì1050 CE. These Viking horses would have been of northern European ancestry. The other main theory suggests that non-Viking peoples, who migrated into Finland from the southeast and south, brought with them horses of Mongolian origin that had been further developed in the Urals and Volga River regions. Both theories have merit, as there were two distinct horse types in the eastern and western regions of Finland that remained distinct from one another until at least the middle of the 19th century. The eastern origin of the breed was first proposed by archaeologist Johannes Reinhold Aspelin, who published Suomalaisen hevosen kotoper√§isyydest√§ (\\"On the Nativity of the Finnish horse\\") in 1886‚Äì1887. Aspelin proposed that Finnish horses descended from an animal that had accompanied the Finno-Ugric peoples' migration from the Volga region and middle Russia to the shores of the Gulf of Finland. A similar idea was suggested over a hundred years earlier by natural historian Pehr Adrian Gadd, and this theory has continued to receive support into modern times. Genetic study in 2014 concluded that closest relatives to the Finnhorse were Estonian horse, Mezen horse, Yakutian horse and Mongolian horse. The veterinarian Ludvig Fabritius considered the proposed prototype a side branch of a \\"Tartarian\\" breed, and considered it possible that the same prototype also influenced Estonian, Swedish and Norwegian horse populations. Contrasting early types: A small, stocky roan Finnish horse from Karelian Isthmus, photographed in 1909. high. Contrasting early types: A more refined flaxen- maned chestnut Finnhorse from Central Finland, photographed in 1910. high. Later, agronomist Axel Alfthan (1862‚Äì1934) and veterinarian Kaarlo Gummerus (1840‚Äì1898) expanded Aspelin's hypothesis, proposing that the horse population later diverged into Eastern Finnish and Mid-Finnish types, which had remained distinguishable as late as the turn of the 20th century. Photographs support these claims: the small Karelian horse was blocky and stout, with pronounced withers, a short neck and large head. The small horse from central Finland, on the other hand, was \\"more noble\\", with a longer body, lighter neck and more refined head. The Swedish professor Eric √Ökerblom even suggested that the Finnish horse spread along river valleys to Troms, Norway, and was the ancestor of the Nordlandshest/Lyngshest, found around the Lyngenfjord. The Norwegians continue to utilise Finnhorse bloodlines, having purchased the Finnish pony-type stallion Viri 632-72P for stud use in 1980. However, √Ökerblom dismissed the possibility that the eastern Finnhorse came from same prototype as the western pony breeds. In 1927, veterinarian and professor Veikko Rislakki (then Svanberg) proposed a different theory in his doctoral thesis. He argued that three types of wild horses existed in Europe, one of which he believed to be the Przewalski's Horse. Rislakki believed this unrefined and notably large-headed type was the horse the early Finns encountered about 1000 BCE. He suggested that the Finns later encountered other peoples and horses south of the Gulf of Finland, and that these peoples had better proportioned horses with a shorter muzzle and wider forehead, descended from the Tarpan. In addition, Rislakki suggested that the Finns came across European horses of Spanish and French origin during the first few centuries CE, larger in size and with narrow foreheads. Rislakki believed that his craniometric examinations, carried out in the 1920s, proved the influence of all these three horse types. Almost 20 years later, during the Continuation War, Rislakki also measured Karelian horses, and proposed they also came from an original Northern European animal descended from the Tarpan. Modern studies have discredited theories suggesting modern domesticated horse breeds descending from the Tarpan or the Przewalski's horse. The modern Konik horse resembles the extinct Tarpan however. In the early 20th century, English J. C. Edward and Norwegian S. Petersen, proposed that Finland and the other countries surrounding the Gulf of Finland were the home region for the so- called \\"yellow pony\\". A later ethnologist, Kustaa Vilkuna (1902‚Äì1980) supported this view, proposing that an \\"Estonian-Finno-Karelian pony\\" descended from a small forest horse previously widespread in the lands surrounding the Gulf of Finland. Earliest horse equipment (bits) found in Finnish graves date from the Finnish Middle Iron Age, beginning from circa 400 CE. Breeds considered to descend from the same early types as the Finnhorse include the Estonian Native horse, the Norwegian Nordlandshest/Lyngshest, the Swedish Gotland Russ, the Mezen horse from the region of Archangelsk, Russia, and the Lithuanian ≈Ωemaitukas. At some point in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions crossbred with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work. The earliest known documentation of Finnish trade in horses, both as imports and exports, dates to 1299, when Pope Gregory IX sent a letter of reprimand to the merchants of Gotland, who were selling horses to the non-Christianized Finns. Apparently the Finns succeeded in improving their horse population, as the predominant form of Finnish trade in horses eventually shifted from imports to exports. A Russian chronicle from 1338 mentions \\"Tamma-Karjala\\" (\\"Karelia of the Mares\\"), presumably denoting a place of good horse breeding. As early as in 1347, King Magnus IV saw it necessary to put limits to the horse exports from Karelia to Russia. Later, the 16th century writer Olaus Magnus mentioned the high quality of the horses used by the early Finns; in the 1520s, Gustav Vasa found the Finns exporting horses by the shipload to L√ºbeck, and strictly prohibited such trading, banning the sale of horses under the age of 7 years. =Organised breeding= The earliest document noting the importation of outside horses to Finland is a papal letter in 1229. During the Swedish rule of Finland that followed, foreign horses obtained by the Finnish cavalry, whether purchased for replenishment or seized as spoils of war, probably influenced the Finnish horse population. The first significant, planned efforts to improve the quality of horses through selective breeding in Finland occurred in the 16th century, when Gustav Vasa, known for his interest in horse breeding, founded mare manors (), stud farms, on his properties in Western Finland. He ordered the importation of larger horses from Central Europe, mainly from the region of Friesland. These horse were brought to Sweden and probably into Finland as well. The imports were kept at regional royal farms (, literally, \\"King's estate\\") to service local mares. In a letter from 1556, Gustav Vasa mentions that there were 231 breeding horses of this kind in Finland. It is not known whether these horses were imported directly from Central Europe to Finland, or descended from imports brought first to Sweden. Friesian stallions were used in Finland early in the 16th century to increase the size of the Finnish horse, and were employed for breeding in the royal farms up until the 1650s. Gustav Vasa also carried out major reforms of his cavalry. After the decline of heavy cavalry in the Late Middle Ages, light cavalry was gaining importance, and with it a new approach to horse breeding. In 1550, he gave orders that \\"stud manors\\" () be founded on royal farms (Sw: kungsg√•rd), not only in Sweden but also in every municipality of Finland. These studs were to each hold 20 mares and a smaller number of stallions, both Finnish horses and horses imported from Sweden. Gustav Vasa also imported mares from the lands bordering the North Sea; most likely of a Friesian type. His goal was to increase the size and weight of the Finnish horse population. His successor, Eric XIV prohibited the exporting of Finnish horses, which demonstrated the success of these efforts as well as the importance of the horses of the region of Finland. The horse breeding farms lasted only for about 100 years under later rulers of the Vasa line before the programs deteriorated. The last of the stud manors, that of Pori, was closed in 1651, and the crown-owned stallions and mares of the Pori stud were transported to Gotland. Outside of these breeding efforts, Finnish horses were widely kept in semi-feral conditions through the mid-19th century. Ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna describes how all horses regardless of sex and age were let out on forest pastures for the summer after the spring fieldwork was finished. The pasture was scarce and the terrain challenging, with both rocky ground and wetlands. Vilkuna considers this practice an important factor in making the Finnhorse an easy- keeping, hardy breed. =Military use= Historical re-enactment of early 20th century cavalry use of the Finnhorse. 1922 Ratsumieskilta (\\"Horseman Guild\\") uniform. The goal of Gustav Vasa and others had been to increase the height of the Finnish horse. However, the Finnish cavalry survey records (katselmusp√∂yt√§kirjat) from the 1620s indicate this goal was not achieved. The heights of horses surveyed in 1623, measured not at the withers but at the highest point of the croup, which provides a height measurement significantly different from standard measures, ranged between , the taller animals being the horses of officers. Only the horses owned by Colonel Herman Fleming were taller, with a croup measurement of . It is not known if these horses were domestic crossbreeds or imported. The average height of the horses of the troops of Hollola, Pori and Raseborg was only one year, but those in the next year's survey were . Overall, there were no pony-sized horses below a croup measurement of , and the all-around average height of the horses used by the cavalry was about . During the Thirty Years' War in 1618‚Äì1648, the horses used by Finnish cavalry were small and unrepresentative, considered inferior even to the cargo horses used by the Swedish Royal Army. However, these animals had great stamina, a crucial quality during long, exhausting campaigns. The humble-looking Finnish horses were presumably exchanged when possible for other horses obtained as spoils of war. It was probably rare for a cavalryman to return with the same horse with which he left, and it is likely that the horses brought back to Finland were crossbreeds or of purely Central European lines. Reinforcements to replace the considerable horse casualties were obtained from the Baltic States, but during the reign of Charles XI almost all of the cavalry horses were imported from south of the Gulf of Finland, due to their larger size. Before World War II, the Finnhorse was the breed that made up almost all of the horses that were part of the Finnish army and mounted police forces. While officers mostly rode various foreign light horse breeds, the so-called \\"light type\\" of Finnhorse was used for the enlisted members of the cavalry. Many of the most talented Finnhorses had competitive success during their service. After the war, the Finnish cavalry was converted to infantry, and the use of the Finnhorse for riding purposes nearly ended. =Crossbreeding= The Orlov trotter was one of the breeds widely used for crossbreeding the Finnish horse. Late 19th century drawing. The Finnish horse had been intentionally crossbred from as early as the 16th century. Friesians and Oldenburgs were among the first known influences in the breed, having been used in the early 17th century to add size. Friesian horses were used systematically until the 1650s. During the 18th century, new warmblood breeds were created throughout Europe by crossing local native horse populations with light, hotblooded riding horses. Finnish military officers developed an interest in similar breeding while on study secondments (assignments) in foreign military forces. In 1781, Colonel Yrj√∂ Maunu Sprengtporten founded a state stud farm in conjunction with the Haapaniemi military school.In some sources, the given names Yrj√∂ Maunu are in Swedish form, G√∂ran Magnus. The stud had a few stallions described as \\"Arabian\\" and \\"Andalusian\\". For about 30 years, these stallions influenced the local horse population outside the military school as well, and a number of writings from the 19th century mention a \\"Haapaniemi breed\\". Similar if smaller crossbreeding programs developed elsewhere; at Tavinsalmen kartano, the royal estate (kungsg√•rd) of Tavinsalmi, at least one of the mares had been imported from Sweden. Russian Orlov trotters and Don horses also influenced the Finnhorse population in the first half the 19th century, improving its size, ridability and refinement. The horse type originating in Northern Savonia known as the \\"F√ºrstenbergian breed,\\" bred by the engineer F√ºrstenberg at the beginning of the 19th century, was a crossbreed between the Finnish horses and Orlov trotters. The influence of Don horses was seen as late as in the 1920s and 1930s among the black and bay horses used by the Finnish cavalry ‚Äì the dragoons of Nyland had two full squadrons of these colours. In addition to the needs of the military, crossbreeding was used to improve the common working horse; improved roads and advances in agriculture had replaced the previously predominant oxen with the horse, and more horses of better quality were needed for transport and agricultural work. Attempts to create better working horses used many breeds, including Percherons and a heavy Norwegian breed; Ardennes horses were favoured in Southern Ostrobothnia and Southern Finland. In Southern Savonia a multitude of breeds were used. The amount and diversity of crossbreeding led to difficulties in creating a consistent type up until the beginning of the 20th century and the creation of the Finnhorse studbook; some of the first stallions accepted in the studbook were criticised for having a \\"Norwegian\\" look. Other intentional crossbreeding experiments included the bloodstock of Sarkkila and Hali in Northern Karelia, descended from crosses with Russian military horses. The breeding programme of Sarkkila stated one of the stallions to be of \\"F√ºrstenbergian breed\\", and one of the mares of \\"oriental\\" descent. The \\"Hali breed\\", descending from the stallions of Sarkkila, was an important influence in the pedigree of a few notable Finnhorse trotter sires such as Eino 680 and his son Eino-Vakaa 25. Some estates, especially in southern regions of Finland, were known to have used stallions of several light and hot-blooded breeds; for example, an officer in Pernaja bred Arabians. These crossbreeds were probably an attempt to create showy driving horses. A notable failing of a crossbreeding attempt happened in 1875, when a stud was founded in Porvoo to import and export Norfolk Trotters, a breed that has had important influence in several driving horse breeds, including the Standardbred. The crossbred offspring were praised for their looks, but turned out to have poor temperaments and no talent for speed. Due to a combination of the large population of horses in Finland (over 200 000 animals) and the later enthusiasm for purebreeding, these estate-based crossbreeding attempts never had significant influence on the modern Finnish horse. An especially detailed description of the best Finnish horses of the mid-19th century is available due to the development of the Tori horse in Estonia. Three experts were consulted about the Finnish horse in order to ascertain its value for the project. According to the stud farm inspector of the Russian Empire, Mayendorff, Finnish horses were found in four types: the \\"Haapaniemi type\\", the \\"F√ºrstenbergian type\\", an \\"Orlov type\\", and a \\"Karelian type\\". A Finnish academic master, A. Elving, considered Finnish horses most purebred in Karelia, and mixed elsewhere, especially in Southwest Finland, where Swedish, North-German and even English horses had been crossed with Finnish ones, while in Karelia and Savonia the outside influence had been mainly Russian. Swedish count Carl Gustav Wrangler, a respected hippologist of the time, mentioned in his report that Finns were then importing Norfolk Trotters for crossbreeding purposes. Documents created some years after a number of Finnish horses had been imported to the Tori stud describe the Finnish mares obtained. Their average height was , and the colour was typically dark with a star. Their heads were large and necks short but well-carried; their bodies sturdy and proportionate with muscular withers, deep chest and muscular back; the loins were on the long side, and the haunches muscular if sloping. The leg joints were well-defined, the pasterns short and the feet tough. However, records also noted that the legs had \\"serious faults of position,\\" not further defined. The Finnish horses also were considered calm and good workers, and swift walkers and runners. =Decline= In the 18th century, the horse population of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At the beginning of the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger than at any other time in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718. The Russian invasion and occupation caused additional hardships. By the end of Russian occupation in 1721, a third of the Finnish human populace as well as large numbers of horses were lost to war and epidemic diseases. Furthermore, a great number of horses were exported to Russia during the invasion at the command of Peter I. Horses removed from Finland ended up mainly in the area of Vyatka government, and some Russian researchers such as Simanov and Moerder have suggested that the Vyatka horse was developed mainly from Estonian and Finnish bloodlines. In addition to the hardships of war and occupation, the treaties of Nystad in 1721 and √Öbo in 1743 ceded Finnish territory to Russia, which resulted in much of the Finnish horse population being left behind the new borders. The Finnish horses in these now-Russian areas were crossbred with the Russian horses in significant numbers. With the Russians having taken the best animals, combined with the old custom of pastures shared by municipalities or larger areas, rebuilding the horse population took decades. To increase numbers, horses were often bred too young, and inbreeding also occurred. By 1761, one of the first researchers in the agricultural chemistry in Finland described the Finnish horse population of the time: One of the Finnhorse founding sires, Kirppu tt 710, pulling an early sulky at full speed, c. 1890 According to ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna's estimations, calculated from measurements of horse collars used in Finland in the early 18th century, the average peasant's horse was about tall, while some horses employed by manors were larger, sometimes more than tall. Vilkuna also discovered that the horses of the southern and western regions of Finland were larger than those of the northern and eastern regions. This was probably due to the influence of imported horses. By the mid-18th century, a typical Finnish horse was probably about , about the same size as a small contemporary Finnhorse yearling, and weighed about , roughly half the weight of a contemporary working section horse. A civilian horse of good quality had good action and was swift. However, leg faults were common. In response to the decline of the Finnish horse population and especially the great loss of good quality breeding animals experienced during the great famine of 1866‚Äì1868, the Senate of Finland gave orders for three provinces to obtain quality stallions for public use. The scope of the programme was later expanded to include eight provinces, and Finland was divided into breeding districts, which were all to have a state-owned stallion available to service local mares. The horses in this programme became known as \\"crown stallions\\" (). Official guidelines for the selection of stallions were never given, but one common aim throughout Finland was to increase the size and bulk of the horse population to create a type better suited for agricultural work. =Purebreeding and revival= A late experiment of crossbreeding: an estate's carriage horse in the early 20th century, presumably of a Thoroughbred mix. By the end of the 18th century, crossbreeding of Finnish horses began to be described, especially by military leaders, as \\"detrimental crossbreeding\\"‚Äîdamaging to the quality of the Finnish horse, particularly for military use. In the beginning of the 19th century, German historian Friedrich R√ºhs especially blamed the west coast estates for damaging the Finnish horse by crossbreeding. Nonetheless, outside stallions were still imported to Finland. At the end of the century, stallions \\"of oriental, Arabian blood\\" still served at state farms. The influence of the Russian-imported \\"oriental\\" Turkish and Caucasian horses, as well as \\"F√ºrstenbergian\\" horses was also noted. Orlov Trotters were used in Savonia and Karelia, and Norwegian stallions were brought to northern Ostrobothnia. Light riding horses were imported from Russian and Central Europe. Conversely, heavier horses such as the Norfolk Trotter and Ardennes were imported to southern Finland as late as 1870. As Finnish nationalism arose and increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, crossbreeding of the Finnish horse essentially ended and a new direction was taken by Finnish horse breeders. The breed was considered a symbol of the nation, and thus it was desired that it be as purebred as possible. On 20 November 1894, Finland's first horse breeding association Hevoskasvatusyhdistys Hippos (now Suomen Hippos) was founded to breed and improve the Finnish horse by the means of purebreeding, and in 1905, a governmental decree was issued for horse breeding associations to be founded throughout the country, leading to the establishment of the Finnhorse stud book in 1907. At first the only notable objectives of the Finnhorse breeding programme concerned appearance, especially the colour, of the breed. The aim was to remove \\"foreign\\" characteristics. Later, in the 1920s, trials of performance were introduced, and since then, the main objectives of the Finnhorse breeding programme have continued to encourage improvements in the capacity, movement, conformation and character of the breed. Since the establishment of the Finnhorse stud book it has been closed and the breed has been bred pure. While accidental and even intentional Finnhorse crossbreds exist, they are not accepted for the Finnhorse registry and have not been used to develop new breeds within Finland. The Finnhorse stud book remains in the control of Suomen Hippos. =Impact of World War II= Horseman towing a ski messenger returning from the front Horses were a central asset to Finnish military forces during the Winter War (1939‚Äì40) and Continuation War (1941‚Äì1944), when tens of thousands of horses were the main locomotive power of the army due to the shortage of automobiles. Animals were procured from private owners in a systematic procedure, but to ensure the continuity of Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions nor any nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked for identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead. The program was successful in preserving the breed, as the horse population rebounded to its pre-war count of over 380 000 animals as soon as 1945. The great number of Russian horses captured as mat√©riel during wartime became a threat to the Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, and there was no way to ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses back as a part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18 000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia. =Post-war decline= Gelding Reipas, first horse in Finland to earn over one million Marks, was one of the harness racing stars that became a people's hero during the hard decline of the Finnhorse. Approximately 300,000 horses existed in Finland when the Finnhorse studbook was established in the beginning of the 20th century. The horse population, consisting almost entirely of Finnhorses, remained stable for 50 years. The rebuilding of the country after two wars had increased demand for horse power, and by the 1950s, the breed reached its all- time peak, with an estimated 409,000 animals, with a great majority of the horses being of the draught type. However, with the increased mechanisation of agriculture and forestry in the 1960s, the number of Finnhorses dropped precipitously. Horses, having been bred in large numbers only a few years earlier, were taken to slaughter by the thousands; a change in forestry tax policy made previously state-supported horse-powered forestry unprofitable and further discouraged keeping horses. Many working horse bloodlines ended, while lines more suitable for sports and recreation survived. By the 1970s, the breed's numbers had declined to 90,000 animals, and 10 years later as few as 20,000 Finnhorses existed. The breed's all-time lowest point was 1987, with only 14,100 horses. By this time, however, the overall horse population in Finland had been increasing for almost a decade, with lighter harness racing horse breeds establishing their position, counting 12,800 animals the same year. Although other breeds were being increasingly imported and bred, the numbers of the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed. Harness racing and associated parimutuel betting, and to some degree also the relatively new hobby of riding, became the most important factors ensuring the survival of the breed. =21st century= Nearly all Finnish horses foaled since 1971 have been registered. During the first decade of the 21st century, the breed's numbers in Finland stabilised at roughly 20,000 animals, and approximately 1,000 foals are born annually. The breed makes up roughly one third of Finland's total horse population. The objective for ensuring the breed's continuity is to have at least 200 stallions and 2,000 mares used for breeding every year, 3,000 horses used for harness racing, and 6,000 horses for riding and other uses. In the 21st century, most Finnhorses are bred to be trotters, but the breed is also popular at riding schools and for recreational riding. The Finnhorse is a relatively unknown horse breed outside of Finland, with no organised efforts to promote it internationally. The very word \\"Finnhorse\\" was only recently coined, and only became the standard name after 1990. However, a few Finnhorses exist outside Finland, having been exported in small numbers to nations such as Germany and Sweden. As part of an equestrian exchange project carried out in the 1980s, a number of Finnhorses were sold to Austria and Germany in 1985 and 1987. In Germany, the horses were used as foundation bloodstock for the Freund stud, which went on to breed dozens of Finnhorses, selling them in Germany and Austria. A number of horses were also exported to the Netherlands. The German Finnhorse population remains the most notable one outside Finland, with 150 animals. Apart from the exchange project of the late 1980s, activity to export the Finnhorse has been minimal. However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and demand for the Finnhorse was advisable to ensure the survival of the breed. To this end, the objectives of the national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreation and lower level equestrian education; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats. Within Finland, the Finnhorse is considered to have value as the national horse breed with cultural ties and strong support from a variety of Finnhorse organisations. On the other hand, progress in popularizing the breed internationally is complicated by its low population and lack of international recognition. The strengths of the breed in international disciplines are considered to be its good health and working qualities, its versatility, and its novelty value outside of Finland. The versatility of the breed's \\"universal\\" horse type, a Finnish concept, has plusses and minuses: It creates a challenge in marketing because of its vague status to buyers who currently tend to seek conventional horse types, and as a result it lacks a strong advantage over specialized breeds. Yet, the versatility of the Finnhorse can also be an advantage; more specialised breeds may be limited to a smaller range of activities. Influence on other horse breeds A Vyatka horse exhibiting an overall expression similar to the Finnhorse From the 14th to the 16th century, Finnish horses were exported to Russian and Germany in such quantities that eventually restrictions on the number of exports were set. The Finnish horses exported to Russia in early 19th century influenced the development of the Vyatka horse. In the 19th century and early 20th century, horses of Finnish origin were used in creating many Baltic and Russian agricultural draught breeds, such as the Tori Horse and the Lithuanian Draught. In most cases, these breeds were developed by crossbreeding Finnish horses on small local horses, thus increasing size. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Finnhorse was also used in the breeding of the Estonian horse. The heavy Mezen horse was bred with both the Finnhorse and the Estonian Horse, until its stud book was closed in the 1950s. Traces of Finnhorse influence is found in other Soviet and Russian work horse breeds, in the mid-20th century, Finland exported 15,000 horses to Soviet Russia as part of its war indemnity. In the 1960s and 1970s, pony-sized Finnhorses were also used to improve quality and broaden the gene pool of the Norwegian Nordlandshest, which had become highly inbred by the 1960s. =Tori horse= In the mid-19th century, manor owners in Estonia found the native Estonian Horse too small for their agricultural needs, and came to the conclusion that the population would benefit from crossbreeding. Finnish horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten Finnish mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T. Uses Jumping a basic cross-rail In the 21st century, approximately 75 percent of Finnhorses are used at some point in their lives for harness racing, with riding being the second most popular use. Many Finnhorses have multiple uses, such as starting their career in harness racing and later moving on to riding. Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy. They are also popular as pleasure horses. =Draft work= Agricultural and forestry work were the traditional uses of the Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, as it was the only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200 percent of their own weight. There are few draft-type Finnhorse family lines left, and only an estimated two or three hundred animals are known to be used as actual workhorses in the 21st century. However, interest in traditional uses and methods has been increasing, and workhorse competitions are regularly held which usually include horse pulling or ploughing contests. = Harness = Ravikuningatar title, I.P. Vipotiina, during her August 2010 Finnish record run. Finnhorses have historically been used for harness racing, with organised harness races having been held since 1817. Prior to that, racing from church back home had been a traditional recreation among farmers, and harness racing remained a farmer's hobby up to the end of the 1950s. By that time, the number of horses kept in Finland was plummeting and racing lost popularity. After 1959 the Finnhorse was no longer the only horse breed that was allowed to race in Finland; the importing of faster, light trotter breeds and the introduction of Parimutuel betting brought professionalism and new life to the harness racing sport. Increased interest in betting led to growth in racing, which in turn helped establish harness racing as the main use for the Finnhorse during the next decades. Finnhorses also successfully compete in combined driving, and are the breed most often used for the sport in Finland, especially at regional and national levels; the Finnhorse Jehun Viima, driven by Heidi Sinda, was a member of the Finnish singles driving team that finished 2nd at the 2002 World Singles Championships in Conty, France. According to Sinda, the Finnhorse is ideally suited for combined driving, being well-mannered, focused, hard working, obedient, and possessing \\"cool nerves.\\" The Finnhorse Viesker, have been one of the best trotters in Finland ever. =Riding= The Finnhorse's popularity as a breed for recreational riding in Finland has been increasing since the late 20th century. Finnhorses are popular as recreational riding horses, and well-suited for use at riding schools, trekking, and riding therapy. Of the ten horses currently employed by the mounted police of Helsinki, two are Finnhorses, though they are considered a bit small for the job. They are also competitive in many disciplines, and in the 1970s separate competition classes for Finnhorses were established at horse shows, which also helped to increase the popularity of the breed. While in eventing and horse racing, Finnhorses are too slow to compete directly against Thoroughbreds and the sport horse breeds,Note: the best recorded times per kilometre being 1:15‚Äì1:16, or twenty seconds longer than the best Thoroughbred race horses they are a highly reliable mount for cross-country riding, particularly over difficult terrain; during the Continuation War, the breed successfully crossed any wetland with which it was confronted. In endurance riding. Uusi-Helin√§, ridden by Ritva Lampinen, successfully finished the endurance riding world championship competition in Stockholm, Sweden in 1990, finishing 28th. The Finnhorse is considered a reliable and fairly good jumper, and is regularly seen in show jumping classes. Finnhorses have been quite successful at lower levels because they are clean and efficient jumpers, but their shorter stride at the canter and gallop keeps them from competing at more advanced levels. In his 1952 book Ratsastuskirja, Olympic rider Werner Walld√©n described the Finnhorse as enduring and resilient, mentally focused, and an easy keeper. He considered jumping to be the breed's best asset as a riding animal, but noted that its scope does not reach the level required for modern international competition. A Finnish family making hay in 1954. The Finnhorse's mild nature makes the breed a valuable companion in agricultural work as well as a therapy mount. In dressage, the Finnhorse is able to compete with warmbloods up to national levels, and in lower levels it has the upper hand because it can easily perform the required movements, and has smoother gaits that allow for ease of riding. In 2010, a Finnhorse medaled in international paraequestrian dressage competition. In higher level dressage, the breed however it is hindered by its less-flashy movement, restricted by a somewhat upright shoulder. Despite this there are successful dressage horses, and a number of Finnhorses even earn their keep with their dressage winnings, a notable achievement as competing in Finland is expensive and prize money low. Most Finnhorses used in dressage compete at the national 4th level (US) or Grade IV (GB), though some individuals have competed at the Prix de St. Georges level. The Finnhorse is also well-suited to riding therapy, being calm and steady, hard-working, obedient, healthy and enduring. They are small enough to allow the patient to be assisted easily, yet large enough to have gaits that stimulate the muscles, senses, and balance of the rider. Many Finnhorses have also been trained for driving, and therefore are familiar with unusual noises and can be controlled from behind, and ex-trotters are inexpensive. Many Finns also find the appearance of the Finnhorse comforting.

It runs westward from a triple junction with the San Andreas Fault and the Cascadia subduction zone to the southern end of the Gorda Ridge. It continues on west of its junction with the Gorda Ridge, as an inactive remnant section which extends for several hundred miles. Technically, a fracture zone is not a transform fault, but in the case of the Mendocino, the term has been loosely applied to the active fault segment east of the Gorda Ridge as well as to the true fracture zone segment west of it. Many seismologists refer to the active segment as the Mendocino Fault or Mendocino fault zone. The fault section demarcates the boundary between the northwestward-moving Pacific Plate and the eastward-moving Gorda Plate. The Gorda Plate is subducting beneath the North American Plate just offshore of Cape Mendocino. Where the Mendocino Fault intersects the undersea trench of the subduction zone, it also meets the San Andreas Fault. This seismically active intersection is called a triple junction, and specifically the Mendocino Triple Junction. In Tsunami studies, energy focusing around the fracture zone has been noted, leading to increased wave heights in the area around Crescent City, California. The fracture zone is referred to as the Mendocino Escarpment in these studies, descriptively rather than named from its geological origin. History Robert W. Pease observed in 1965 that the alignment of a transverse tectonic zone extending from Mount Lassen to the Walker Lane at the north end of Honey Lake Fault, suggests it was once the continental terminus of the Mendocino Fault. It forms the boundary of the Modoc Plateau and Columbia Plateau provinces with the Great Basin. Where it meets Honey Lake Fault, it bends to trend northeast across the northwest corner of Nevada, where it accompanies the geological trough that forms Black Rock Desert.

He was noted for his popular literature, and is known to have published works under at least fourteen different pen names. Early life Yamamoto was born in what is now Otsuki city in Yamanashi prefecture, to a family in impoverished circumstances. Lack of money forced him to drop out of secondary school, but he continued his education part-time, while living as a boarder above a used bookstore. His pen-name came from the name of the store where he lived. Literary career Yamamoto's literary debut was with a short story called Sumadera fukin, and a stage drama in three acts, called Horinji iki, which were both published in 1926. His early works were aimed primarily at children. In 1932, he turned to popular stories for adults with Dadara Dambei, which received little serious notice from the literary world, so he continued to write popular detective stories and adventure stories for juvenile audiences. These included a series of short stories with samurai themes from 1940‚Äì1945, and stories on heroic historical women from 1942‚Äì1945, both themes being preeminently suitable for wartime Japan. His preference for historically-themed writings carried over into the postwar era, with Momi no ki wa nokotta (The Fir Trees Remain) and the Flower Mat. His works are characterized by a marked sympathy for the underdog, a dislike of authority, and with homage to traditional, popular virtues. His Nihon Fujin Fudoki (Lives of Great Japanese Women) was nominated for the 17th Naoki Award, one of Japan‚Äôs most prestigious literary prizes, but Sh≈´gor≈ç refused to accept, stating modestly that his ‚Äúpopular writings‚Äù should not be considered ‚Äúliterature‚Äù. Yamamoto died in Yokohama of acute pneumonia, and his grave is at the Kamakura Public Cemetery. Legacy A literary prize, the Yamamoto Sh≈´gor≈ç Prize, was established in 1987 on the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Shinch≈ç Society for the Promotion of Literary Arts (Shinch≈ç Bungei Shink≈ç Kai). It is awarded annually to a new work of fiction considered to exemplify the art of storytelling.

This has been provided by Article 246, which has demarcated the legislative jurisdiction of the parliament and the state assemblies by outlining the different subjects under List I for the Union, List II for the State, and List III for both, as given in the seventh schedule to the Indian Constitution. As a consequence, conflicts of jurisdiction arise due to the fact there exist separate lists for the Union and the State to legislate upon. It often happens that strict constitutional boundaries are transgressed in legislation, inviting judicial review of the said bill/act. The enactment of legislation is a function of the legislative power. In order to decide whether particular legislation is unconstitutional for breaching the constitutional limitations of distribution of powers, the Court examines the enactment with some strictness. The legislature can only make laws within its legislative competence. The legislative competence may be limited by specific List entries, or be restricted by other constitutional limitations and prohibitions. It cannot over-step the area of its legislative capability. A simple rule is followed in this regard, which is to find out if the legislating body had the power to legislate directly. If not, then the legislature cannot legislate indirectly. What it cannot do directly, it cannot attempt to do indirectly. Therefore, the substance of the legislation must be articulated for the purpose of determining whether what it enacted, it could really do. The question of colourable legislation was fully discussed by the Supreme Court in K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo v. Orissa, a decision which has been treated as settling the law on the subject. This ruling was confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of Sonapur Tea Co. v. Deputy Commissioner.

Monumental golden mosaic on the fa√ßade. Transportation of the Volto Santo. 12th century baptismal font. The Basilica of San Frediano is a Romanesque church in Lucca, Italy, situated on the Piazza San Frediano. History Fridianus (Frediano) was an Irish bishop of Lucca in the first half of the 6th century. He had a church built on this spot, dedicated to St. Vincent, a martyr from Zaragoza, Spain. When Fridianus was buried in this church, the church was renamed Ss. Frediano and Vincenzo. Soon afterwards, a community of Augustinian canons was growing around this church. In the Longobard era, the church and the canon house were enlarged. In 1104, this order was recognized by Pope Paschal II. The prior of St. Frediano was later accorded a rank equal in dignity to that of a bishop. The church acquired its present appearance of a typical Roman basilica during the period 1112-1147. In the 13th-14th centuries the striking fa√ßade was decorated with a huge golden 13th century mosaic representing The Ascension of Christ the Saviour with the apostles below. Berlinghiero Berlinghieri designed it in a Byzantine/medieval style. Several chapels of the nobility were added in the 14th-16th centuries. These are lavishly decorated with paintings. Comparisons The architecture of the Basilica of San Frediano well represents the characteristics of Romanesque Lucca before the influences of the nearby Pisa, in particular of the Cathedral of Buscheto, and workers from northern Italy change its traditional character. The church still has a simple type of early Christian basilica plan, with curtain walls smooth, without projections or complex joints of the arches, and architectural elements are all of Roman tradition, such as architraves and columns of the facade and the apse, the windows niche, the specially carved composite capitals. These same features are found - in a stadium even purer - in the nearby church of St. Alexander, which includes the remains of an older building in which every element, from the paths proportional to the quality of the walls, the arrangement of unusual materials to bare corinzieggianti capitals, is all ancient Roman traditions. Description Inside, the basilica is built in richly carved white marble. It consists of a nave and two aisles with arches supported by columns with Roman and Romanesque capitals. The Roman capitals were recycled from the nearby Roman amphitheatre. The highlight at the entrance is the huge 12th-century Romanesque baptismal font (the Fonte Lustrale). It is composed of a bowl, covered with a tempietto, resting on pillars, inside a circular basin. It is the craftmanship of master Roberto (his signature is on the basin) and two unknown masters. The basin is decorated with The Story of Moses by a Lombard sculptor. Master Roberto did the last two panels The Good Shepherd and the Six Prophets. The tempietto was sculpted by a Tuscan master, representing the months of the year and the apostles. Behind this font, higher on the wall, are two 15th century glazed terracotta lunettes: The Annunciation and St. Bartholomew, both attributed to the school of Andrea della Robbia. There is another baptismal font, still in use, carved and adapted from a sacramental altar by Matteo Civitali in 1489. The counterfa√ßade houses the 16th century organ in the exquisitely carved, gold-plated choir from the 17th century. On the right hand is the side chapel of St. Zita (c. 1212-1272), a popular saint in Lucca. Her intact mummified body, lying on a bed of brocade, is on display in a glass shrine. On the walls of the chapel are several canvasses from the 16th and 17th centuries depicting episodes from her life. The remains of St. Frediano lie underneath the main altar from the 16th century. A massive stone monolith stands left of the main altar. This was probably pilfered from the amphitheatre of Lucca. But local tradition has it that it was miraculously transported to Lucca by San Frediano and used as a predella (step of an altar) for the first altar. Chapels The Trenta chapel in the left aisle houses the polyptych of the Virgin and the Child, a 15th-century masterpiece by Jacopo della Quercia, carved with the help of his assistant Giovanni da Imola. Below the altar is a Roman sarcophagus with the body of St Richard the Pilgrim, an English ‚Äúking‚Äù (of Wessex), who died in Lucca in 722 while on pilgrimage to Rome. He was the father of Saints Willibald, Winibald and Walpurga. On the marble floor lies a tombstone of Lorenzo Trenta and his wife, equally from the hand of Jacopo della Quercia. Among the many chapels, the Chapel of the Cross certainly stands out. It contains frescoes, recently restored, by Amico Aspertini (1508-1509). The blue vault shows us God surrounded by angels, prophets and sibyls. Above the altar is an anonymous 17th-century painting representing Volto Santo, St. Augustine and St. Ubaldo. On the right wall is the fresco of St. Frediano displacing the course of the river Serchio, while trying to stop the flooding. Next to it is a column which is, at closer sight, actually flat. The sgraffiti are drawn in the art technique of trompe l‚Äôoeil, giving a false perspective and the illusion of a column. On the left wall is the fresco of the Transportation of the Volto Santo from the port of Luni to Lucca by the Blessed Giovanni, bishop of Lucca. In the front the stooping old lady in red robe certainly steals the show. The mortal remains of this bishop are preserved in this chapel. The Chapel of St. Anne was constructed in the 16th century, but the paintings date from the 19th century. On the left side of the altar is the Death of St. Anna by B. Rocchi. In the middle, above the altar, St. Anna Adores the Child by Stefano Tofanelli. On the right side of the altar is the Birth of Mary by A. Cecchi.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 6, 2002. In the episode, weight loss advocate Jared Fogle incurs the wrath of South Park after he announces that he lost weight because he has aides (misinterpreted as AIDS). This leads Cartman, Kyle and Stan to try to use Butters as their own advocate for City Wok. The episode also parodies the film Philadelphia. \\"Jared Has Aides\\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The episode, which satirizes since-disgraced Subway spokesman Jared Fogle, was inspired after Parker saw several commercials featuring Fogle on television. Plot Jared Fogle gives a speech at South Park, touting how easy it is to lose weight by simply eating a diet of Subway sandwiches. Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Butters visit Jared, and are dismayed when Jared reveals that his weight loss is not only the result of eating sandwiches, but also with the help from his aides (a personal trainer and a dietician). Kyle convinces Jared that he is being dishonest by never referring to his assistants, and Jared realizes the boys are correct, and plans to give another speech to discuss them. At Jared's next announcement, he raves about his aides. The townspeople misconstrue the statement, thinking that he is infected with AIDS, and become repulsed by him. After being fired by Subway, Jared begins to wish he never hired aides. His assistants convince him that people are upset because they cannot hire their own assistants, inspiring Jared to start the \\"Aides for Everyone\\" (misinterpreted as \\"AIDS for Everyone\\") foundation. The townspeople are angered further, and chase him through town. Jared laments that everyone hates him for saying he has AIDS while he beats a dead horse with a baseball bat. When Jared is caught, the mob prepares to lynch him; however, Stan and the boys intervene, and clarify that Jared was not referring to AIDS, but his assistants. The townspeople apologize, and begin laughing at their mistake. Everyone declares AIDS is finally humorous, and begin celebrating as a banner, with \\"AIDS is Finally Funny\\" inscribed on it, is unveiled. In a subplot, Cartman devises a scheme to earn money after discovering that Jared did not have to eat sandwiches to lose weight. He proposes that Butters gain much weight and then become fit by other means, while pretending that he lost weight by eating at City Wok. After striking a deal with the manager of the restaurant to film several commercials, Butters manages to gain the weight, but finds himself unable to lose it, and the boys resort to liposuction. As they perform the operation, Butters' parents return home, and ground him for performing surgery in the house. When it is time to film the commercials, Butters states he is grounded and will not leave; however, the boys manage to convince him to come as Cartman stays behind at Butters' house to cover for him. Butters' parents call the house, with Cartman replying to them each time with crude language. Meanwhile, when Stan discovers City Wok's owner will only pay them 15 dollars, he severs the deal, and Butters returns home. Just before Butters' parents arrive, Cartman brings over a lawn chair, a drink, and a bucket of popcorn, then sits outside and watches as Butters' parents ruthlessly beat him for the language that Cartman, pretending to be Butters, used on the phone.

The episode, which heavily satirizes former Subway spokesman and weight loss advocate Jared Fogle, was inspired by the fact that Parker and Stone had seen several Subway commercials featuring Fogle; as Parker said, \\"there was a Jared commercial on all the damn time, and it was getting pretty out of hand.\\" The subplot from the episode, featuring Butters faking losing weight in order to strike a deal to film commercials with City Wok, was inspired by Parker and Stone wondering if Fogle really lost weight by eating a diet consisting entirely of submarine sandwiches, with Stone saying on the commentary that \\"I could go gain 20 pounds, and then eat nothing but McDonald's. I just wouldn't eat very much McDonald's.\\" The character of Jared Fogle would later return in the fourteenth season episode \\"200\\", as one of several celebrities who returned to South Park for justice, and again, albeit briefly, in the season nineteen premiere \\"Stunning and Brave\\". The episode features the first appearance of restaurant City Wok and its manager, who would later become a recurring character. Parker and Stone were inspired to include a parody of the restaurant in South Park while working on their film Orgazmo. They wanted Chinese food, so they ordered from City Wok. The person answering the phone said, with an Asian accent, \\"City Wok\\", which Parker and Stone heard as \\"Shitty Wok\\". They began laughing, and would call the restaurant several times just to hear the person say \\"shitty\\". \\"Jared Has Aides\\" was originally titled \\"Subway Sandwiches Gave Jared AIDS\\". However, while working on the episode, the Comedy Central advertising department contacted Parker, saying that they were not allowed to use the word \\"Subway\\" disparagingly in the episode, as Stone said, \\"We're like, 'Come on, you know they're trying to sell food by telling you you're going to be thin, and it's just terrible.' 'But Subway is one of our biggest sponsors, so you can't do it.' That is censorship. It absolutely is. It's just economic.\\" However, Parker decided to \\"just [do] it anyway.\\" As such, the episode was finished \\"at the last minute,\\" in order to avoid network oversight. The finished episode aired with numerous references to the Subway restaurant and brand. Reception Jared Fogle called the fact that an episode was devoted to him \\"very flattering\\". \\"Jared Has Aides\\" has received positive reviews. DigitallyObsessed called \\"Jared Has Aides\\" a \\"standout\\" of the sixth season. Amber Conrad of InsideCRM included \\"Jared Has Aides\\" in her list of \\"25 Things I Learned About Business From South Park,\\" saying that \\"basically, the lesson here is that sometimes you have to do uncomfortable things like stuff yourself with food then starve yourself to get money. But it's still money.\\" Jared Fogle indicated he had no problems with the episode in a 2003 interview with The Washington Post; although saying it had \\"typical[ly] tasteless humor\\", he called the fact that an entire episode was devoted to him \\"very flattering\\" and said \\"you know you've made it when shows like South Park start parodying you.\\" Home release \\"Jared Has Aides\\", along with the sixteen other episodes from South Park: the Complete Sixth Season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season a rating of 9/10.

(3 October 2003) =2008 to present= Michelle Obama hoax Beginning in 2007, Johnson emerged as a strident opponent of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. His rapid swing from the left to the right earned him the enmity of former allies. According to The New York Times, Johnson is \\"best known for spreading a hoax... in 2008 that Michelle Obama had been videotaped using a slur against Caucasians\\". His blog, NoQuarterUSA, often criticized Obama's qualifications to be president. On May 16, 2008, Johnson posted an item entitled, \\"Will Barack Throw Mama From the Train?\\" which alleged that a tape existed of Michelle Obama \\"railing against 'whitey' at Jeremiah Wright's church.\\" Johnson claimed that Republicans were in possession of the tape and it \\"is being held for the fall to drop at the appropriate time.\\" In a subsequent post, Johnson claimed that Obama's appearance had occurred when she was on a panel with Louis Farrakhan. He also explained that he himself had not seen the tape, but had spoken with \\"five separate sources who have spoken directly with people who have seen the tape.\\" The Obama campaign's \\"Fight the Smears\\" website denied the rumor, saying, \\"No such tape exists. Michelle Obama has not spoken from the pulpit at Trinity and has not used that word.\\" No tape was ever released, nor has any other evidence emerged of Obama using the word \\"whitey\\". On October 21, 2008, Johnson said that, according to one of his sources, the McCain campaign \\"intervened and requested the tape not be used.\\" War crime accusations against John Kerry In 2013, Johnson falsely accused John Kerry of war crimes in Vietnam, alleging that Kerry had \\"raped some poor Vietnamese woman.\\"\\"John Kerry, Rapist and Liar\\", No Quarter To support his claim, Johnson used a YouTube video that contained audio clips from a 1971 debate on The Dick Cavett Show between John Kerry and John O'Neill.

Johnson was the source for Napolitano's claim. The conspiracy theory was later asserted as fact by President Trump, with him citing Fox News and Napolitano. GCHQ responded, stating that the claims were \\"nonsense, utterly ridiculous and should be ignored\\". Fox News later disavowed the statement by Napolitano.

Pierce played in parts of three seasons in the majors from until with the Atlanta Braves and Detroit Tigers. He also played with the Nankai Hawks in Japan in 1977. However, Pierce is better known for his exploits in minor league baseball. As of 1998, he ranked ninth all-time in minor league home runs with 395. Early years Pierce was born in Laurel, Mississippi, in 1948. He attended San Jose High School in San Jose, California, and San Jose City College. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Pierce was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the third round of the 1969 Major League January Draft-Secondary Phase. He began his professional baseball career in 1970 with the Braves' rookie league team in Mission Valley, Idaho, the Magic Valley Cowboys, where he hit 16 doubles and nine home runs in 281 at bats. In 1971, Pierce next played with the Single A Kinston Eagles of the Carolina League, where he compiled a .292 batting average, tied for the Carolina League lead with 29 doubles and ranked second with 20 home runs. In 1972, he played with the Double A Savannah Braves of the Southern League where he hit .292 with 29 doubles, 23 home runs, and 103 RBIs. =Atlanta Braves= Pierce began the 1973 season with the Triple A Richmond Braves of the International League. After 11 games, he was batting .343 with two home runs and 11 RBIs when he was called up by the Atlanta Braves.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33849422/baseball_calls_sick_list/ Pierce made his major league debut on April 27 and tallied only one hit for a .050 batting average in his brief 11 game call-up before being sent back to Richmond. In 1974, Pierce told the Braves he did not want to return to Richmond and was sent instead to the Charros de Jalisco of the Mexican Pacific League. He compiled a .306 batting average and ranked second in the Mexican League with 28 home runs, earning himself another call-up to Atlanta, where he again managed only a single hit in nine at bats for a .111 batting average. =Detroit Tigers= In early 1975, Pierce asked the Braves to trade him. He was traded in March to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Reggie Sanders. Pierce began the 1975 season with Detroit's Double A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, where he hit .282 with nine home runs and 25 RBIs in 36 games. Detroit's first baseman Nate Colbert struggled early in the 1975 season, and Pierce was called up at the end of May. Pierce said at the time: \\"I think I'm as good a first baseman as most anyone. But I've never had a chance to prove it.\\" On June 15, 1975, the Tigers sold Colbert to the Montreal Expos, and Pierce became the team's starting first baseman. He appeared in 53 games for the 1975 Tigers, 47 of them as the Tigers' starting first baseman. In his short time with the Tigers, he committed 13 errors at first base, ranking third among American League first basemen for the entire 1975 season. At the plate, he hit .235 with eight home runs in 170 at bats. In early August 1975, Pierce lost the job as Detroit's starting first baseman to Danny Meyer. Pierce appeared in his last major league game on September 12. In late September, Pierce acknowledge that his fielding had been subpar: \\"I know I made some mistakes in the field . . . Dumb mistakes . . . mistakes that I never made before in my life. I messed up -- I know that.\\" =Minor leagues, Mexico and Japan= Pierce returned to Mexico, where he homered 36 times, winning the first of three homer crowns. He hit .331/~.410/.599 for Puebla in 1976 and also topped the Liga with 109 RBI. The next season, Pierce once again found himself in another country, this time Japan, where he signed with the Nankai Hawks for the 1977 season. He hit .227/.302/.399 with 13 homers in 291 at-bats. Right before opening day the next year, the Hawks let Pierce go. Pierce returned to America in 1978, signing a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. In 1978, he played for the San Jose Missions, and in 1979 for the Spokane Indians, both Triple-A farm clubs of the Mariners, without getting to the majors. Pierce returned to his old haunts in Mexico, but struggled in his third trip to the Liga, hitting just .198 in 32 games. Jack returned to form somewhat in 1980; while his average was low and he slugged under .500, he did hit a league-best 17 homers in the strike-shortened season, taking his second home run crown. In 1984 the Mexican League began using the lively Commando ball and Pierce took advantage better than most ‚Äì he raised his average 118 points to .364 with an OBP around .438 and a slugging of .659. He was second to Antonio Lora in RBI (117) and third in homers. A year later he cranked out 40 in his second season for the Bravos de Le√≥n, with 104 runs and 118 RBI, slugging .620. He was third in RBI and second in homers, one behind league leader Andr√©s Mora. 1986 saw Pierce set a Mexican League record with 54 home runs for the Braves. The old mark had been 46 by H√©ctor Espino ‚Äì in addition to Pierce, Nick Castaneda (53) and Willie Aikens (46) at least matched the old record. Pierce hit .381, scored 111, drove in 148, slugged .783 and had an OBP around .464. Pierce also spent some time as Leon's player- manager that year. After slipping to .277/~.372/.516 with 24 homers in 1987, Pierce retired. As of 2000, his 294 homers in the Liga were 8th in league history, the best by a U.S. native. Pierce had hit .300 and slugged .553 in his 11 years in Mexico. Later years Pierce was elected to the Sal√≥n de la Fama in 2001. He was the batting coach of the Sultanes de Monterrey team. Pierce died from a pulmonary embolism in Monterrey, Mexico at the age of 64.

In 1989, the North Carolina General Assembly designated the Plott Hound as the official State Dog. The Plott Hound was first registered with the United Kennel Club in 1946. Plott Hounds were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2006 and were exhibited at the Westminster Show in 2008. Chosen for their tracking and hunting abilities, two Plott Hound puppies have been trained as K9 deputies for the Guilford County Sheriff's Department. Appearance The Plott Hound is generally athletic, muscular, and agile in appearance, with a medium build. Unlike some other hounds, the Plott Hound's skin is not baggy. The Plott Hound is a strongly built yet moderate hound, with a distinct brindle-colored coat. Its appearance suggests the capacity for speed, stamina and endurance. May have an identification mark on it that is used to identify the dog when hunting. Such a mark is not penalized in conformation shows. =Coat and color= The Plott Hound's fur should be fine to medium in texture, short or medium in length, and have a smooth and glossy appearance. According to the National Plott Hound Association, the dog's fur should be brindled. Brindled is defined as \\"Finely streaked or striped effect or pattern of black or tan fur with fur of a lighter or darker background color. Shades of colors accepted: yellow brindle, red brindle, tan brindle, brown brindle, black brindle, grey brindle, and maltese (slate grey, blue brindle).\\" Acceptable colors are any of the above-mentioned brindles. Black with brindle trim is the alternative. The Association dictates that while some white on the chest and/or feet is permissible, white found anywhere else is a fault. =Size= A Plott Hound should measure approximately 20 to 25 in (55 to 71 cm) at the withers for males, 20 to 23 in (53 to 63 cm) for females. Males should weigh 50 to 60 lb (23 to 27 kg). Females should weigh 40 to 55 lb (18 to 25 kg). History left Of the seven breeds of United Kennel Club (UKC) registered coonhounds, the Plott Hound is the only that does not trace its ancestry to the foxhound. The Plott Balsams, a mountain range in North Carolina, are named for the Plott family, whose ancestor, (Johannes) George Plott (c. 1733-1815), immigrated to North Carolina in the late 18th century from Germany. The Plott Hound breed of hunting dog is also named for the Plotts.Marcus Simpson, Harold Pratt, Birds of the Blue Ridge Mountains (University of North Carolina, 1992), p. 182. The ancestors of today's Plott Hounds were used for boar hunting in Germany. Originally from Germany, in 1750 Johannes \\"George\\" Plott emigrated to the English colony of North Carolina. He brought a few wild boarhounds (five Hanoverian Hounds, used for bear and boar hunting) with him. These dogs had been bred for generations for their stamina and gameness. George and his wife Margaret with their family settled in the mountains of western North Carolina. Though there is no evidence that Plott ever went to western North Carolina, his son Henry settled there around 1801 to 1810 (as the census discloses) and was responsible for the Plott Hound's later development. Plott supposedly kept his strain entirely pure, making no outcrosses. In 1780, the Plott Hound pack passed into the hands of Henry Plott. Shortly after, a hunter living in Rabun Gap, Georgia, who had been breeding his own outstanding strain of \\"leopard spotted dogs\\" heard of the fame of the Plott Hounds and went to North Carolina to see for himself. He was so impressed that he borrowed one of Montraville Plott's top stud dogs for a year to breed to his own bitches. This single cross is the only known instance of new blood being introduced into the Plott Hound since it first went to the US. Eventually Montraville decided not to continue this breeding practice and gave all of the leopard dogs away, returning to his original breeding practices. Other crosses possibly took place around 1900. G.P. Ferguson, a neighbor of the Plott family in North Carolina in those days, was a major influence on the Plott Hound breed. He made a careful study of the Blevins hounds and the Cable hounds of that era. The extent to which he used these bloodlines in his Plott Hound breeding program is not known.

The tower is 162 meters (531.5 feet) high, 82 meters (269 feet) long and 41 meters (134.5 feet) wide. , DPDHL Website ‚Äì History Mergers and acquisitions The acquisition of the Swiss logistics provider Danzas and the largest American service provider in the field of international airfreight, Air Express International (AEI), by Deutsche Post, happened in 1999. Founded in 1815, the prestigious Danzas group was regarded as one of the world's leading logistics companies. With approximately 29,000 employees at the time of acquisition, Danzas had a strong logistics network on all continents. The acquisition of AEI was similar. AEI had a network of branches in 135 countries. In addition to integrated logistics and multi-modal transport, it was offering warehousing, distribution, customs processing and IT-based logistics services. AEI was integrated into the Intercontinental division of Danzas. As a full-service provider, the merged companies provided Deutsche Post with a dense transport network as well as an impressive portfolio of value-added services. The partnership with DHL International, which began with the acquisition of a minority interest in 1998, was expanded and intensified in 2000. Negotiations were then concluded, allowing Deutsche Post to establish a majority interest from 1 January 2002. In July 2002, Deutsche Post acquired a 25-percent share in DHL from Lufthansa Cargo and increased its majority stake to 75 percent. At the time, DHL Worldwide Express had more than 71,000 employees worldwide. A pioneer in global express shipping, DHL's international network linked over 220 countries and territories. DHL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group in December 2002 after Deutsche Post acquired the remaining shares from two investment funds and Japan Airlines. In December 2005, Deutsche Post acquired the British logistics company Exel for 5.5 billion euros. At that time, approximately 111,000 employees worked for Exel in 135 countries. The company concluded the first half of 2005 with a 55 percent leap in profits to 172 million pounds (251 million euros). In 2006 Deutsche Post took a majority stake in Williams Lea, a business process outsourcing (BPO) provider specializing in document management and mail services., DPDHL Website ‚Äì Press Release 2006 In July 2011, DHL acquired Tag Worldwide, an international provider of marketing execution and production services. In 2017, DHL sold the combined Williams Lea Tag business to Advent International. In May 2018, DHL Supply Chain strengthened its presence in Latin America by acquiring Colombian logistics company Suppla Group. At the time of the acquisition, Suppla employed over 4,500 employees in 25 cities of Colombia. Regions and sectors DHL Supply Chain is organized into six regions: North America, South America, APAC (Asia Pacific), Greater China, MLEMEA (Mainland Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and UK&I; (United Kingdom and Ireland). The Exel brand was retained for North America (USA and Canada), with the headquarters for the region in Westerville, Ohio. In 2016, the Exel brand transitioned DHL Supply Chain for the North America region. DHL Supply Chain trades in six focus sectors: AEMCE (Automotive, Engineering, Manufacturing, Chemical and Energy) Consumer, Retail, Technology, Service Logistics, Life Sciences and Healthcare. =Consumer and retail= Consumer and Retail are two of DHL Supply Chain's largest sectors. Both of these offer major growth potential for the division, since DHL manages the supply chains all the way from the source of supply to the end customer. Services in these sectors range from international inbound logistics and warehouse and transport services, to packaging and other value- added services. =Technology= In the Technology sector, DHL Supply Chain's portfolio of offerings ranges from inbound-to-manufacturing services and warehouse and transport services to integrated packaging, returns management and technical services. =Life sciences & healthcare= In 2011, DHL Supply Chain acquired Eurodifarm, a specialist in the controlled-temperature distribution of pharmaceutical and diagnostic products. The purchase was made to strengthen DHL Supply Chain's market leadership in Italy in this sector. In England, DHL Supply Chain operated the NHS Supply Chain for the National Health Service until April 2019. It has a contract for patient transport services in North London and has been criticised for poor response times to patients wanting to book a service and for refusing disabled people permission to bring an escort. The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust oversees the call centre. =Automotive= The Automotive industry is one of DHL Supply Chain's global sectors. The company has a strong presence in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil. =Energy= The fast-growing Energy sector is another market in which the DHL divisions provide logistics for both the build and run phases of major projects. Products In the Supply Chain business, DHL Supply Chain provides customers in many industry sectors with logistics services along the entire supply chain ‚Äì from planning, sourcing, production, storage and delivery to returns logistics and value-added services ‚Äì in order to ensure logistics flow. DHL Supply Chain offers warehousing, distribution, managed transport and value-added services as well as business process outsourcing, supply chain management and consulting. DHL Supply Chain's goal is to ensure that their customers‚Äô products and information reach their markets quickly and efficiently, thus securing them competitive advantages. Some of the key DHL Supply Chain products include: Lead Logistics Provider, Packaging Services, Integrated Logistics Procurement, Technical Services, Service Parts Logistics, e-Fulfillment, Airline Business. Market position DHL Supply Chain was the global market leader in contract logistics with a market share of 8.3% (2010). In this highly fragmented market, the top ten players account for only about 23% of the overall market, the size of which is estimated to be ‚Ç¨147 billion. DHL Supply Chain is the regional market leader in the regions of North America, Europe and Asia Pacific and also has a very strong position in rapidly growing markets such as Brazil, India, China and Mexico. Financial results DHL Supply Chain, as the contract logistics business of Deutsche Post DHL, generated profitable growth in year 2011. Revenues and earnings were well above the previous year's level. The division reported a revenue increase of 1.2 percent to EUR 13.2 billion (2010: EUR 13.1 billion). As a result of portfolio adjustments made during 2011 ‚Äì such as the divestment of a subsidiary in the United States that was not part of the division's core business ‚Äì this result only partially reflects the division's operating performance. Adjusted for these consolidation and exchange-rate effects, SUPPLY CHAIN's revenues rose by nearly 6 percent, or more than EUR 700 million, in 2011., DPDHL Annual Earnings 2011 Press Release This increase was fueled in particular by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region as well as in the Life Sciences & Healthcare and Automotive sectors. Additional contracts worth EUR 1.3 billion were concluded in 2011, an increase of around EUR 200 million versus the previous year. Combined with additional operating improvements and strict cost management, increased business activity drove up the division's earnings in 2011. At EUR 362 million, the operating earnings were 56.7 percent above the previous year's level of EUR 231 million.

Background Lazear was the son of William and Charlotte n√©e Pettigrew. He attended Trinity Hall Military Academy and Washington & Jefferson College, both in Washington, Pennsylvania, and obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1889 from Johns Hopkins University and his PhD in Medicine in 1892 from the Medical School at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He did his specialization in Paris at the Institut Pasteur. In 1896 he married Mabel Houston with whom he had two children. He was also a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Career Lazear was a physician at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore starting in 1895, where he studied malaria and yellow fever. In 1900 he reported for duty as the assistant surgeon at Columbia Barracks (Quemados, Cuba) for the United States Army. After a few months in Quemados, Lazear, together with Walter Reed (1851‚Äì1902), James Carroll (1854‚Äì1907) and Aristides Agramonte (1869‚Äì1931), participated in a commission studying the transmission of yellow fever, the Yellow Fever Board. During his research at Camp Colombia, he confirmed the 1881 hypothesis of Carlos Finlay that mosquitoes transmitted this disease. Lazear was the only member of the commission who had experience working with mosquitoes, and he used mosquito larvae from Finlay's laboratory. He wrote to his wife in a letter dated September 8, 1900, \\"I rather think I am on the track of the real germ.\\" Lazear deliberately allowed an infected mosquito to bite him in order to study the disease. He contracted the disease and died at age 34, seventeen days after writing his hopeful letter. The fact that this was a deliberate act was covered up at the time‚Äîfor reasons unknown, but possibly connected with family insurance policies‚Äîand the story put about that Lazear had mistaken the mosquito for an uninfected one of a different species. The truth was discovered in 1947 by Philip S. Hench from Lazear's own notebook.Lawrence K. Altman, Who Goes First?: The Story of Self- experimentation in Medicine, pp. 149-150, University of California Press, 1987 . A dormitory at Johns Hopkins University was named after him in honor of his sacrifice, as was a former chemistry building at Washington & Jefferson College, Lazear's alma mater.

He served two terms as the ninth and 14th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and represented Virginia as a Republican in the United States Senate during the Reconstruction period after the Civil War. Biography John F. Lewis was born on the \\"Lynnwood\\" plantation in rural Rockingham County, Virginia, a son of Samuel Hance Lewis (1794‚Äì1869) and Nancy Cameron Lewis (1795‚Äì1841). He attended an old field school and engaged in agricultural pursuits as a young adult. He married Serena Helen Sheffey (1823‚Äì1901) in October 1842, and they raised six children. He was a delegate to the Virginia secession convention in 1861, but refused to sign the ordinance of secession. He was the only member from east of the Allegheny Mountains that refused to endorse the document. During the Civil War, portions of the Battle of Port Republic were fought on his family's land. Lewis was an unsuccessful Union Party candidate for Congress in 1865. He was elected as Virginia's lieutenant governor in 1869 and served from October 5 of that year until January 1, 1870. Upon the readmission of Virginia to representation in the U.S. Congress, Lewis was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate and served from January 26, 1870, to March 4, 1875. He served on the Committee on the District of Columbia in the Forty-third Congress. He was not a candidate for reelection as the Republicans had already become a minority party by 1874 and wouldn't control either house on their own in Virginia for the rest of the 19th century. He returned home and was appointed by Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes as the United States Marshal for the western district of Virginia 1875-1882, when he resigned. Lewis was again elected lieutenant governor in 1881, alongside Readjuster Party candidate William E. Cameron, and served with him from 1882 to 1886. After his term, no Republican served as Virginia's lieutenant governor until John N. Dalton served from 1974 to 1978. He retired from politics after his term and resumed his agricultural pursuits. He died at Lynnwood in Rockingham County, Virginia. He was buried in the family burial ground on the plantation. References External links * New York Times, obituary for John F.

Its main character expresses concern about being buried alive. This fear was common in this period and Poe was taking advantage of the public interest. The story has been adapted to a film. Plot In \\"The Premature Burial\\", the first-person unnamed narrator describes his struggle with things such as \\"attacks of the singular disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy\\", a condition where he randomly falls into a death-like trance. This leads to his fear of being buried alive (\\"The true wretchedness\\", he says, is \\"to be buried while alive\\"). He emphasizes his fear by mentioning several people who have been buried alive. In the first case, the tragic accident was only discovered much later, when the victim's crypt was reopened. In others, victims revived and were able to draw attention to themselves in time to be freed from their ghastly prisons. The narrator reviews these examples in order to provide context for his nearly crippling phobia of being buried alive. As he explains, his condition made him prone to slipping into a trance state of unconsciousness, a disease that grew progressively worse over time. He became obsessed with the idea that he would fall into such a state while away from home, and that his state would be mistaken for death. He extracts promises from his friends that they will not bury him prematurely, refuses to leave his home, and builds an elaborate tomb with equipment allowing him to signal for help in case he should awaken after \\"death\\". The story culminates when the narrator awakens in pitch darkness in a confined area. He presumes he has been buried alive, and all his precautions were to no avail. He cries out and is immediately hushed; he quickly realizes that he is in the berth of a small boat, not a grave. The event shocks him out of his obsession with death. Analysis Fear of burial alive was deeply rooted in Western culture in the nineteenth century,Meyers, Jeffrey: Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. Cooper Square Press, 1992: 156. . and Poe was taking advantage of the public's fascination with it.Kennedy, J. Gerald. Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing. Yale University Press, 1987: 58‚Äì59. Hundreds of cases were reported in which doctors mistakenly pronounced people dead.Premature burial in the 19th century In this period, coffins occasionally were equipped with emergency devices to allow the \\"corpse\\" to call for help, should he or she turn out to be still living. It was such a strong concern, Victorians even organized a Society for the Prevention of People Being Buried Alive.Premature burial in the 19th century Belief in the vampire, an animated corpse that remains in its grave by day and emerges to prey on the living at night, has sometimes been attributed to premature burial. Folklorist Paul Barber has argued that the incidence of burial alive has been overestimated, and that the normal effects of decomposition are mistaken for signs of life.Barber, Paul. Vampires, Burial and Death: Folklore and Reality. Yale University Press, 1988. The story emphasizes this fascination by having the narrator state that truth can be more terrifying than fiction, then reciting actual cases in order to convince the reader to believe the main story.Quinn, Arthur Hobson. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998: 418. . The narrator in \\"The Premature Burial\\" is living a hollow life. He has avoided reality through his catalepsy but also through his fantasies, visions, and obsession with death. He does, however, reform‚Äîbut only after his greatest fear has been realized.Selley, April. \\"Poe and the Will\\" as collected in Poe and His Times: The Artist and His Milieu, edited by Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV.

General operation  = In matches = In some situations, the tiebreaker may consist of another round of play. For example, if contestants are tied at the end of a quiz game, they each might be asked one or more extra questions, and whoever correctly answers the most from that extra set is the winner. In many sports, teams that are tied at the end of a match compete in an additional period of play called \\"overtime\\" or \\"extra time\\". The extra round may also not follow the regular format, e.g. a tiebreak in tennis or a penalty shootout in association football. =In tournaments and playoffs= In some sports, tournaments, and playoffs, the tiebreaker is a statistic that is compared to separate contestants who have the same win-loss record. Some competitions, such as the FIFA World Cup, the EuroLeague, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and the National Football League, have a whole set of tiebreaking rules in which a group of statistics between the tied teams are compared, one at a time, to determine the seeding in their respective knockout or playoff tournament. The statistics that are compared may include total goals scored, the record between the two tied teams, and other factors. In many of these tiebreaking rules, if the teams remain tied after comparing all of these statistics, then the tie is broken at random using a coin toss or a drawing of lots. Swiss system tournaments use a variety of criteria not found in other types of tournament which exploit features specific to the Swiss system: see tie-breaking in Swiss system tournaments. In some sports leagues, a one-game playoff, or occasionally a \\"best-of\\" series format, may be played instead to break the tie. =In promotion/relegation and draft order= Some sports leagues may use tiebreaking rules to help determine which teams who have the same win-loss record are promoted and relegated or have the higher pick in their respective sports draft. These tiebreaking rules may be the same ones used in their respective knockout or playoff tournament, except that the tied team with the worse statistic is the one that is either relegated or receives a higher draft pick. However, in some sports leagues, such as the National Football League, the set of tiebreaking rules to compare the worst-ranked teams is completely different than the rules to determine the playoff teams. Specific sports =Association football= In association football contests, many matches are allowed to end in a draw, but in cases where a winner must be chosen, there are three methods of deciding this. The usual method is Normal Extra Time, where each team will play two 15-minute periods of extra time (but see also Golden goal). The team that leads at the end of 30 minutes wins the tie. If, at the end of extra time, no winner can be decided, the match goes to a penalty shootout. Occasionally, in matches such as the Community Shield in England, the match can go straight to a penalty shootout after 90 minutes' play has been completed. Alternatively, in tournaments such as the English FA Cup, the match is replayed in its entirety, going through the aforementioned stages of extra time and penalties if the second match is drawn. This method is no longer used from the quarter finals onwards. =American football= In the National Football League of professional American football, if both teams are tied at the end of regulation, an overtime period is played under modified \\"sudden death\\" rules. Before the 2017 season, this period was 15 minutes in all games. Since 2017, a 15-minute period has been used only in playoff games (in which a winner must be decided); overtime in preseason and regular-season games consists of a 10-minute period. If the team that receives the ball first scores a field goal, then the opponent must receive a chance at equalising that score of their own; the first team to score a touchdown or safety wins the game; and once both teams have had possession of the ball in overtime, the first team to score under any legal means, touchdown (offensive or defensive), field goal or safety, wins. If neither team scores before the end of the overtime period, or both teams score one field goal each, the game is considered a draw and ends, and counts as a \\"half-win\\" in the standings for purposes of winning percentage for both draft order and playoff positioning. However, in the playoffs, true sudden death rules apply from double overtime onwards. =Australian rules football= There is no tie-break for regular season matches in Australian rules football, and both teams earn two points each. In the AFL, new rules were introduced for finals in 2016: if there is a tie at the expiry of regulation time, including in the Grand Final, two five minute halves of extra time are played with the teams swapping end after each half. If the match is still tied when extra time has expired, there is a third untimed extra time period under sudden death rules, and the final siren will not sound until the next team scores. Previous systems Prior to 1991, if the scores were tied in a finals match after the final siren, the drawn final would be replayed on the following weekend, thus delaying all other finals by one week. Due to various logistical issues that arose following the drawn 1990 Qualifying Final, the AFL replaced this procedure with extra time (with the exception of the Grand Final) in 1991. Until 2015, if the scores in a finals match were tied when regulation time expired, two five-minute halves of extra time were played until a winner was determined. This procedure was used twice: in the 1994 Second Qualifying Final between North Melbourne and Hawthorn (won by North Melbourne), and the 2007 Second Semi-Final between West Coast and Collingwood (won by Collingwood). If the scores were tied after the final siren in the Grand Final, the match would be replayed on the following weekend. =Baseball= If a baseball game is tied at the end of the usual nine innings, the game continues into extra innings until an inning ends with one team ahead. Although games are occasionally ended as ties on account of weather or darkness (the latter happened much more often before lights were installed on most professional baseball fields in the 1940s), and some leagues (including Nippon Professional Baseball) allow only a limited number of extra innings before a game ends as a tie, professional baseball in the United States has no such limit. The longest Major League game in history (on May 1, 1920) lasted 26 innings, and a minor-league game in 1981 lasted 33 innings. In some venues, including international baseball, starting with the second extra inning, that inning may begin a full reset of the batting order to the coach's choice with up to two runners already on base, in order to increase the chances of a resolution. Major League Baseball uses the term \\"tiebreaker\\" to refer to one or more additional games played after the scheduled end of the regular season between teams with identical win-loss records in order to determine participants in postseason play. = Chess = In Chess, when two players play a match against each other and the score is even after the scheduled number of games, often there is a tie-break with games with faster time controls. In tournaments, when two or more players have the same final score, there can be a play-off but usually an auxiliary scoring system is used. =Cricket= =Field target= Field target ‚Äî a precision air rifle shooting sport ‚Äî uses either a sudden-death or shot count tiebreaker. The sudden-death tiebreaker (usually used to determine a single place such as 3rd when 3 awards are to be given or between two shooters) consists of each tied shooter (order dictated or decided by coin-toss or other technique) shoots at a target (typically a difficult shot such as ¬Ω\\" at 35 yards). If all shooters in the tie fail, then the target is moved closer. If one shooter hits, then the next shooter(s) who miss are out of the competition. If a round is complete with multiple ties remaining, the target is moved out (made more difficult) and the same procedure is repeated until only one shooter remains. This procedure can then be repeated to determine further placings among the losers of the previous round. In cases where multiple places are to be determined (as in five people tied for first place), one approach is to have each shooter make several shots (n ‚àí 1 or more with n being the number of tied shooters). If all shooters miss all shots, the target is moved in (made easier); similarly, if all shooters hit on all shots, the target is moved out (made more difficult). If some variation in hits exists after a round, the top score gets the highest placing while those with identical scores can have a sudden-death shootout or a repeat of the multiple shot shootout (typically with a more difficult target) to determine other placings. =Ice hockey= =Tennis= =Snooker= If the scores are level when all the balls are potted in a frame of snooker, the black is \\"respotted\\" (placed back on the table, on its designated spot) and the cue ball put \\"in hand\\". The referee will then toss a coin, and the winner of the coin toss decides who will take the first shot. Play then continues until the black is potted or another frame-ending situation occurs. =Sumo= At the conclusion of a , the winner of a division is the with best record at the end of the 15-day tournament. If two or more wrestlers share are tied for the lead within a division, a series of additional playoff bouts will be held on the final day to determine the divisional champion. Restrictions against bouts between close relatives, members of the same stable, and previously faced opponents are lifted during a playoff situation. Outside sport The term \\"tiebreaker\\" is sometimes used loosely outside the world of sports ‚Äî for example, for an innovative weapon or strategy introduced in a war where the two opposing armies are evenly matched, a decisive political move introduced in an electoral race where the contending parties are evenly matched (such as a casting vote), and similar situations in other fields.

The strips were initially written by Kokkila together with Sami Laitala. Other scriptwriters have also occasionally participated in the comic. The comic depicts the adventures of Per√§smies, a Finnish superhero and a parody of Superman. The name Per√§smies literally means \\"Butt Man\\" and is a play off Ter√§smies (\\"Steel man\\") which is the Finnish name for Superman. The \\"official\\" English name of Per√§smies, according to Kokkila, is \\"Phartman\\", although \\"Pooperman\\" might better capture the essence of the original pun. Per√§smies is a middle-aged, severely alcoholic homeless man living in a landfill, whose only superpower is the ability to fart supernaturally hard. He gained this power as a result of consuming a can of radioactive pea soup, pea soup being the stereotypical flatulence-inducing dish in Finland. Per√§smies uses farting primarily as a rocket engine, which enables him to fly. On some occasions Per√§smies has used farts as a chemical weapon. His farts have also had more esoteric uses such as melting holes in ice. Despite his alcoholism and lack of any semblance of personal hygiene, he has good intentions and often manages to save the world in the end. One notable Per√§smies strip set the hero against his Soviet counterpart, Toveri Pieru (\\"Comrade Fart\\"). They first competed against each other by saving people from disasters, but finally Per√§smies challenged Toveri Pieru to a drinking competition, which Per√§smies won. The strip ended with a moral lesson: :Remember, children ‚Äî violence is not a solution to problems, but alcohol is. Per√§smies was killed by a drunk driver in the last issue of Pahkasika. However, a sequel titled Per√§smiehen poika (\\"Son of Per√§smies\\") has been appearing in the Koululainen magazine since 2003. The Finnish Film Foundation has agreed to support the Finnish film studio Helsinki-filmi to make a film about Per√§smies.Pahkasika-sankari Per√§smies elokuvaksi , Suomen Kuvalehti blog, 4 November 2009.

In modern square dancing, the dancers interpret the caller's directions (calls) to determine whom to act with, where to go, and how to get there. All square dancers learn standard \\"definitions\\" of calls, which they recall and use when the caller issues a given command. Most square dancers learn about 100 calls. Challenge dancing involves many more calls, and the definitions and choreographic combinations are more abstract and difficult to process. The same physical movements (e.g. arm turns, passing by) are employed, but deciphering the complex commands and figuring out what you're supposed to do is much more challenging. Levels and lists Modern Western square dancing is organized into a hierarchy of standard syllabus programs (also called \\"levels\\"). Each level is described by a list of the calls that will be used, inclusive of all the material from the lower levels. The higher the program, the more material (i.e. calls) on that list, and the greater ability to recall and handle complexity is required of the dancers. The levels preceding Challenge are: Mainstream, Plus, and Advanced (A1 and A2). There are five Challenge levels: Basic Challenge (C1), Extended Challenge (C2), Extended Challenge (C3A), Challenge 3B (C3B) and Challenge 4 (C4). The first three of these are maintained and organized by Callerlab, while the last two exist on a more ad hoc basis, maintained by a small set of interested callers. As a result of this there are a few different C4 lists, mostly the same, but with various differences. What makes Challenge dancing challenging? C1 dancers must be familiar with about 250 calls (including those from Mainstream, Plus, and Advanced). By C3, the dancers must be familiar with more than 400 calls. C4 dancers typically know at least 700 calls. Challenge square dancing not only involves knowing many more calls, but is typified by the extensive use of Concepts, abstract and physical formations, \\"Phantom\\" dancers, and call deconstruction (such as Fractionalization). Some square dance calls are more complex than others, involving more series of actions and more abstract identifications of whom to do the action with. Challenge lists include more of these complex calls, but none are by themselves more complex than calls at the Advanced level. Much of Challenge dancing uses basic calls (such as \\"Right And Left Thru\\", or notably, \\"Circulate\\"). However, Challenge demands that the dancers have precise understanding of the call definitions, and combines and modifies calls in a way that yields more complex interpretations. =Concepts= In addition to the calls which denote a particular dance action, Challenge dancing makes extensive use of \\"concepts\\" which denote modifications to calls ‚Äì either how they are executed or to whom they apply. There are only a few concepts before C1, e.g., the \\"As Couples\\" concept in Advanced. Each Challenge level adds about another ten new concepts. As with calls, the number of concepts at C4 is not as well defined. In addition, concepts can be nested, so that a call is modified by more than one. For example, \\"Tandem\\" means that two dancers one behind the other act as one dancer, while \\"Stable\\" means that the dancers are to move from place to place as the call would normally require but without changing their facing direction as they normally would. The caller can ask that a call be done \\"Stable Tandem\\" which means that pairs of dancers must act together to execute the call, but as they do this none of them turn. =Formations= Just as Plus adds Diamonds and Advanced adds Hourglasses, Challenge dancing adds new formations which have their own rules for circulation as well as calls that apply specifically to them. Additional formations include Butterflies, Galaxies, Triangles, Xs, and Zs. Also, many formations used at lower levels are extended to include cases where they are \\"distorted\\" ‚Äì while they have the same number of dancers and the dancers follow the same rules of interaction, they are not spaced the same way. For example, a wave may be \\"offset\\" so that the two halves are not lined up with each other, or a \\"parallelogram\\" consisting of two lines offset from each other can be considered to be two \\"boxes\\" even though the dancers in each box are not adjacent to each other. Irregular distortions, e.g., where four arbitrary dancers not lined up in any obvious way are asked to act as a wave, may also be used. In each case, the dancers must follow the rules of the basic call, but adjust their actual movements so that they correspond to the positions of the distorted formation. =Phantoms= Challenge dancing makes extensive use of \\"phantoms\\" ‚Äì imaginary dancers who hold positions in a formation that is only partially filled by real dancers. Challenge dancers must learn to do their part of a call in a particular formation even though many of the other dancers ‚Äì possibly all of them ‚Äì are missing. This requires both a clear understanding of the call definition and the ability to remember where the positions of the formation are without the usual visual and tactile cues. Calls which cause the dancers to change from one formation to another (\\"shape-changers\\") are especially challenging to dance with phantoms because the positions themselves will be changing and the entire formation may have to move to make room for other formations (even ones that have no real dancers at all to mark their position). =Fractionalization= Frequent use is made in Challenge dancing of fractionalized calls, both explicitly (e.g., the caller asks the dancers to do half of something) and implicitly through concepts. Many calls are defined to have specific \\"parts\\". Other calls can be broken down naturally based on the nature of the movement involved (e.g., a Hinge is half of a Trade). Starting at the C1 level, concepts are introduced which operate on call parts. For example, the \\"Finish\\" concept means to do all of the call except for the first part. At higher levels there are meta-concepts which involve applying concepts to only certain parts of a call (e.g., \\"Evenly\\" means that only the even-numbered parts of a call should be affected by the specified concept). To properly apply these concepts, the dancer must have both an excellent understanding of the definitions of the basic calls, including how the parts are defined, and the ability to keep track in real- time of what concepts are being applied to which parts. Challenge dancing organizations and events =Clubs= Some Challenge dancing is done in clubs similar to those at lower levels. In general, because of the limited number of dancers and callers, the higher the level the fewer clubs there will be. There are only a few cities that have clubs, with a live caller, dancing higher than C1 on a weekly basis. =Tape groups= Dancers who are interested in learning or dancing a particular Challenge level often form private groups and dance using recordings. =Regional events= In addition to local clubs, in many places there are events organized to offer Challenge dancing to the dancers of a larger geographic area on a less-frequent basis (e.g., monthly). These often feature callers from other areas. Some general square dance conventions and festivals at the regional or state level include a Challenge hall, but they typically have very limited offerings above C1. =National and international events= The largest Challenge event currently operating is the multi-level Academy for Advanced and Challenge Enthusiasts (AACE), held annually in June. This event has dedicated halls for C1, C2, C3A, C3B, and C4. (It also includes an A2 hall.) Challenge dancing is included in the much larger National Square Dance Convention (NSDC), but there is typically only one hall for Challenge and the emphasis is on the lower Challenge levels. The annual convention of the International Association of Gay Square Dance Clubs (IAGSDC) has a much more extensive Challenge program that is attended by many non-gay dancers. In Europe, the biennial iPAC (International Plus, Advanced, and Challenge) convention offers dedicated halls for all the Challenge levels. Many other events held annually at various dance facilities attract Challenge dancers from a wide area who are interested in particular levels or callers.

The chassis was designed and fabricated by Barry Pearson; it consisted of a square-tube spaceframe onto which a 13B rotary powerplant from a Mazda RX-7 was fitted. Two more years of development saw a number of cars built; the first V8 was powered by a TVR crate engine supplied by the customer. According to CarSales it used a 4.6 litre Rover engine. Bettini decided a Toyota 4.0 litre Quadcam as used in the Soarer and Lexus SC400 would be a more desirable choice and the next production run saw four normally aspirated cars built and sold. Sprintex, a supercharger company owned by Advanced Engine Components Ltd. (AEC) was commissioned to develop a supercharger system for the new \\"wide-body\\" model released in late 1999. AEC was so impressed with the supercharged Bullet SS that they purchased the Bullet company and set up a new manufacturing facility at Yatala in Queensland Australia. The wider body models shared only the boot lid and doors with the Mazda MX5, with all other body panels made from fiberglass reinforced plastic that was bonded to the chassis. AEC decided that the new Bullet Roadster and supercharged SS models should become fully Australian Design Rules (ADRs) compliant, and they invested heavily to achieve that end on 4 December 2002. All cars built from then on were classified as genuine production models and were priced at $98,000 for the Roadster and $118,000 for the SS. Performance was spectacular with the engine taking the SS from zero to in less than 5 seconds. Braking and cornering were also outstanding due to the huge Brembo brakes and fully adjustable suspension attached to 18 √ó 9\\" wheels. Resale values remain high with recent sales (2008) of $27,500 for an excellent 1998 Rotary, $37,500 for a 2000 Roadster and $62,000 for a pre-production supercharged SS.

Although Lazarus based the character on his own mother, when he showed it to her, she thought the character was based on his aunt, exclaiming, ‚ÄúYou caught Aunt Helen to a tee!‚Äù \\"Momma\\" has three grown children: * Thomas, her oldest, is employed and happily married. As far as Momma is concerned, her son's wife Tina will never do anything for Thomas as properly as Momma can. Tina doesn't think too highly of Momma either. * Francis, her middle child, a chronic and shameless slacker, is the single largest source of her exasperation. He has little interest in working and always looks for loopholes in work contracts. It suits him perfectly to sponge off her and sometimes other people, yet he cannot be bothered to lift a finger to help or to clean his own apartment. He has a single taste in women: airheads built and dressed rather provocatively. His friends with similar work ethics sometimes show up. * Marylou, her youngest, has frequent relationship problems, particularly with her mother. She has a thing for losers and outcasts ‚Äî the very types of men Momma loathes. Marylou does not, however, favor the types of men Momma is determined she marry: well-educated and/or well-heeled. While Momma constantly tries to make her children feel insignificant without her, they consider her to be an emotional burden. Still, they love her in their own way as she loves them in turn. During the course of the strip, Momma has a variety of dream sequences, which include a homeless Francis holding a cup for donations. Other dream sequences include her late husband Jerome and herself at the gates of Heaven, awaiting entrance.

Peritoma serrulata), commonly known as Rocky Mountain beeplant/beeweed, stinking-clover, bee spider-flower, skunk weed, Navajo spinach, and guaco is an annual plant in the genus Cleome. Many species of insects are attracted to it, especially bees, which helps in the pollination of nearby plants. It is native to southern Canada and western and central United States. This plant has often been used for food, to make dyes for paint, and as a treatment in traditional medicine.  Taxonomy  In 1814, Frederick Traugott Pursh described this species in the first volume of Flora Americae Septentrionalis, based upon specimens collected by the Lewis and Clark Expedition near the Vermillion River in South Dakota. In the first volume of Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis in 1824, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle moved this species to a genus which he named Peritoma (replacing the earlier illegitimate name Atalanta Nuttall), and calling the species Peritoma serrulatum. In 1901, Edward Lee Greene expanded Candolle's Peritoma, including this species as Peritoma serrulatum DC. and Peritoma lutem Raf. as well as two other species that he knew little about. At least Peritoma serrulata has been determined to be a synonym of Cleome serrulata.  Description  Cleome serrulata is an annual plant growing to tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The leaves are trifoliate, diminutive teeth, and with three slender leaflets each long. The flowers are reddish-purple, pink, or white, with four petals and six long stamens. The fruit is a capsule long containing several seeds. Flowering lasts an extended period because it begins at the bottom of the stalk and works its way up. The onset of flowering and seed pods comes at the same time. Cell wall elasticity is higher in specimens that live in drier climates. The pollen is about in length with three furrows which have one pore each. Moisture, temperature, and time are critical in seed germination. Germination occurs during summer and plants can quickly grow to . Flowers are often covered with a variety of insects, especially bees. Elongated capsules contain the seeds, which are dark brown to black, curved, and have a wart-like appearance. After the seeds are dispersed, the plants begin decomposing. The plant is called waa‚Äô in the Navajo language, tumi in the Hopi language, and both a'pilalu and ado:we in the Zuni language.  Distribution and habitat  Cleome serrulata is native in southern Canada from British Columbia to Ontario and in the United States from the west coast of the United States east to Ohio and southwest to Texas. It is also naturalized farther east in North America, including Maine. This species is often found in disturbed lands--such as roadsides, open woods, mountain foothills, and prairies. The plants prefer moist alkaline soils that are light or sandy. It grows in a wide range of pH levels and prefers mild shade or full sun while being drought tolerant. It is commonly found at elevations of in the northern Rocky Mountains. This gorgeous plant is often found with the following species: Pascopyrum smithii (western wheatgrass), Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass), Koeleria macrantha (prairie Junegrass), Poa secunda (Sandberg bluegrass), Gaillardia aristata (common gaillardia), Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush), and Ratibida columnifera (prairie coneflower).  Uses  Cleome serrulata has been used in the southwestern United States as a food, medicine, and dye since prehistoric times and is one of very few wild foods still in use. As food, its seeds can be eaten raw or cooked, or dried and ground into meal for use as a mush. The leaves, flowers and shoots can be cooked and eaten as a cooked vegetable or added to cornmeal porridge. Among the Zuni, the leaves gathered in large quantities and hung indoors to dry for winter use. The young leaves are cooked with corn strongly flavored with chili peppers. To reduce its bitter taste, pieces of iron or rust were sometimes added to the cooking pot. Animals rarely feed on this plant because of its disagreeable taste and odor. Nitrate poisoning can result if too much is consumed. Birds do eat the seeds, and the plant provides good cover for land reclamation and upland birds. The Tewa and other Southwestern United States tribes often included Cleome serrulata as a 'fourth sister' in the Three Sisters agriculture system because it attracts bees to help pollinate the beans and squash. In traditional Native American and frontier medicine, an infusion of the plant is used to treat stomach troubles and fevers, and poultices made from it can be used on the eyes. As a dye, the plant can be boiled down until it is reduced to a thick, black syrup; this was used as a binder in pigments for painting black-on-white pottery at least as long ago as 900-1300 by the Ancestral Puebloans. The Navajo still use it to make yellow- green dye for their rugs and blankets. Plant paste is used with black mineral paint to color sticks of plume offerings to anthropic gods, and the whole plant except for the root is used in pottery decorations.

The term can mean (1) any of the American regional styles (broadly, Northeastern, Southeastern, and Western) that existed before around 1950, when modern Western style began to develop out of a blend of those regional styles, or (2) any style (other than modern Western) that has survived, or been revived, since around 1950. Traditional square dance can be distinguished from modern Western square dance by the following characteristics: #A limited number of basic movements, or ‚Äúcalls,‚Äù enabling the average dancer to join the group by assimilation rather than by taking a series of lessons. #Dance figures (sequences of basic movements) that are called in a set order and repeated, rather than improvised by the caller. (In Southeastern style the caller chooses figures from a repertoire of a dozen or two and can call them in any order, but the order of movements within each figure does not change.) #The use of live music as the norm. In addition, because there is no governing body to set standards for traditional square dancing, each caller decides which basic movements and dance figures he or she will use. There are regional variations in how dancers execute the basic movements, usually having to do with hand or arm position. The same dance figure may have different names in different regions; the same name may refer to different dance figures, or even (in the case of \\"do-si-do\\") different basic movements. This lack of standardization does not present a problem to the dancers, because at least one of two conditions is always true: either the caller walks the dancers through the figures before calling them to music, or the event is attended almost entirely by local people familiar with that caller's repertoire. Types of traditional square dance There are at least three broad categories of events that can be referred to as \\"traditional square dances\\". # \\"Survival\\" dances: There are a few communities in the United States and Canada where one may find dance events consisting primarily of traditional squares, or of traditional squares alternating with some form of couple dancing (such as waltz, two-step, foxtrot, or country/western dance) or solo dancing (such as flatfooting or clogging). Each region has its own way of dancing, playing the music, and delivering the calls (if any); the dancers, musicians, and callers have typically learned their style from prior generations. There may or may not be some standardization of style within a region, but there is no continent-wide standardization across regions. # \\"Revival\\" dances: In many cities and college towns there are dance events, open to the public, that consist primarily of Anglo-American group dances. The program may feature mainly squares, mainly contra dances, or a mixture of both. The style of squares chosen depends on the caller and may or may not conform to the local indigenous square dance style‚Äîindeed, it may be a blend of various regional styles‚Äîbut it is likely to be closer to traditional than to modern Western square dance. Musicians and callers typically learn not only from local mentors but also from books, recordings, and travel to and communication with other artists continent-wide; this learning process leads to a certain amount of de facto standardization. # \\"Fun nights\\": Many callers conduct programs of easy dancing for people who do not square dance regularly, such as guests at a wedding or birthday party or members of a non-dance organization like a school, house of worship, or civic or social group. Such events are known in the calling trade as \\"fun nights\\", \\"barn dances\\", or \\"one- night stands\\". A caller programming such an event is likely to use a good deal of traditional dance material, even if he or she is primarily a modern Western caller. Regional styles Traditional square dances have been classified into three major types: Northeastern, Southeastern, and Western. The first two have distinctive and unique characteristics; the Western type is thought to be a blend of the two. There are many regional and local styles of square dancing; each has been adapted through the years from one or more of the three major types.Friedland, LeeEllen. \\"Square Dancing\\". In Cohen, Selma Jeanne. International Encyclopedia of Dance, vol. 5. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. p. 685 =Northeast= The Northeastern tradition, descended from the 18th-century cotillion and the 19th-century quadrille, comprises primarily figures in which the action is initiated by a facing pair of couples, either the heads or sides. Many of the basic movements (such as \\"ladies chain\\" and \\"right and left\\") that make up the figures are common to the entire Northeastern repertoire. As in its ancestors the cotillion and quadrille, the movements in this style of square dance are synchronized with the phrases of the music. If the dancers know a particular dance by heart, they can execute it without calls, and indeed some communities that dance quadrille-type squares do so without the aid of a caller. Areas where Northeastern squares have been documented include Cape Breton Island, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Ontario, New England, Upstate New York, Michigan, and parts of Pennsylvania. =Southeast= The Southeastern tradition, whose origin is still uncertain,Friedland, p. 687 comprises primarily figures in which a single couple visits each of the other couples in turn. The structure is not dependent on the four-couple square formation, and the dance is often done in a large circle containing any number of couples. (By the 1920s some communities had adopted a system in which every other couple led out at the same time.Friedland, p. 686) Each figure (such as \\"Bird in the Cage\\") is unique, being made up of a series of movements that appear in no other dance; typically the whole figure has a name but its constituent movements do not. The dance is generally not synchronized with the musical phrase, although the dancers move in time with the beat. At the direction of the caller, the active couple may execute the same figure with each couple it visits, or a different figure with each couple. In either case the caller chooses the figures from a local repertoire of a dozen or two, each figure being danced the same way whenever it is chosen. Areas where Southeastern squares have been documented include the southern Appalachian Mountains and adjacent regions (Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia) and the Ozarks (Missouri and Arkansas). =West= The Western tradition appears to have developed as settlers from the eastern United States took their local dance forms along as they moved west. It combines elements of the quadrille and visiting-couple traditions. Areas where traditional Western squares have been documented include Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. =Regional mixing= As interest in square dancing increased during the 20th century, schoolteachers and recreation leaders began using these dances in their programs. These leaders learned not only from local callers but also from books, recordings, and correspondence with other leaders. The result has been a blurring of the lines between regional styles; since the 1920s, callers have been increasingly likely to incorporate in their programs (knowingly or not) calls and figures from styles outside their own area, and even from modern Western square dancing. Some dances composed by modern Western callers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but no longer used in the modern Western network, are now thought of as \\"traditional\\".See, for example, http://sca.uwaterloo.ca/cotsdca/calls/arch_in_the_middle.htm. This dance, Ends Turn In, was written in the early 1950s by Ed Gilmore of California, and its signature movement was for a time considered a \\"basic\\" in modern Western dancing, yet the dance is accepted as traditional by the Canadian Olde Tyme Callers' Association. Music Traditional square dance is almost always danced to live music (the main exception is \\"fun nights\\", which are often conducted by modern Western callers using traditional material with recorded music). Since the 19th century, much of the square dance repertoire has been derived from jigs (in time) and reels (in time) from Scotland and Ireland. In some regions, such as New England, these tunes are played in relatively unaltered form. In the southern Appalachians and the Ozarks, the style is more likely to conform to the old time music tradition. Quebec has its own dance music tradition, which is based on Irish music but has evolved into a unique style. Cape Breton Island has a well-preserved style of dance music, based on Scottish fiddling. Square dance music was traditionally played on acoustic instruments, and in many places it still is. The fiddle is the most common lead instrument; other lead instruments, and instruments that carry the rhythm and harmony, vary by region. In areas that were settled by Europeans relatively early, such as New England and eastern Canada, the piano is the mainstay of square dance rhythm and chording. In the Southern United States and along the path of westward expansion, instruments like the banjo and guitar, which are more portable and easier to make and repair than the piano, were and are more common. The double bass has long been popular as a supplement to the rhythm section. Certain instruments are popular in specific regions; examples include the accordion in Quebec and Newfoundland and the hammered dulcimer in Michigan and Upstate New York. In some communities where square dancing has survived, the prevailing form of music has become popular songs from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, played on instruments such as saxophones, drums, and electric guitars. The tempo of traditional square dance music can vary widely, depending on the regional style. New England has some of the slowest tempos, from around 108 to 124 bpm. Southern Appalachian tempos are among the fastest, at 130 to 150 bpm. Most other regions fall between those extremes. Many traditional dance tunes retain the binary form of classical dance, following an \\"AABB\\" pattern of two distinct strains played twice each, the \\"A part\\" and \\"B part\\" typically being 8 measures (16 downbeats) in length, making one playing of the tune 32 measures (64 downbeats). In a few tunes the A and B parts are half the normal length; in others, particularly those derived from marches or rags, one or more parts are twice the normal length. Practice varies among fiddlers as to whether to repeat the parts of such non-standard tunes. In some areas, notably Quebec and parts of the southern and southwestern United States, there is a strong tradition of playing \\"crooked\\" tunes ‚Äî tunes in which at least one part has more or fewer beats than the norm. Because callers in those areas do not synchronize their calls with the phrases of the music, crooked tunes do not bother them. In regions where the callers and dancers are used to staying \\"on phrase\\" (as in a contra dance), crooked tunes are not used for square dancing. In the northeastern United States, traditional square dances are frequently done to popular songs in addition to, or instead of, jigs and reels. Where this is done, the caller typically sings the calls, substituting dance directions for some of the words of the song but reverting to the original lyrics for the last few measures of each chorus, often encouraging the dancers to sing along. Singing callers normally choose songs that are similar in structure to fiddle tunes‚Äîthe same number of measures, played at a similar tempo. There are exceptions, however: a waltz such as \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" may be sped up from its original time to a fast time. Organization and social customs \\"Survival\\" dances are typically either run by a band or caller as a profit-making enterprise, or sponsored by a non-dance organization (such as a church, a Grange, or a fire department) as a social service and/or a fundraiser for its other activities. The dance may be advertised as open to the public, but the vast majority of those attending are likely to be local people who know one another. Almost everyone present is likely to know the dances: often there will be little or no teaching or walkthrough, and in some communities the same few dances are done at every meeting, without a caller. The dancers may dress up a bit‚Äîthough not necessarily in square-dance-specific costumes‚Äîand they may attend and dance exclusively with a spouse or other regular partner. \\"Revival\\" dances are usually run by a nonprofit organization set up specifically to sponsor dance events, though they may also be run by a band or caller. The dance is normally open to the public; a few series are advertised as \\"for experienced dancers\\", but it is typically left to the dancers themselves to decide whether they qualify as experienced. Often a large percentage of those attending are not very familiar with the dances; the caller is likely to walk through most or all of the figures before the music starts. Casual attire and frequent partner changes are the norm; it is considered acceptable to ask a stranger to dance.

He is most famous for claiming that Joseph Stalin was actively preparing to invade western Europe in 1941 before any suggestion of the German eastward assault in Operation Barbarossa.  Operatsia Groza  Bunich published three volumes with the title \\"Operatsia Groza\\"‚Äî\\"Operation Thunderstorm\\"‚Äîthe first one in 1994, the last one posthumously in 2004. In these books he communicates a plan of Stalin for an invasion of whole Western Europe: \\"Operation Thunderstorm\\". It can be found in the so-called \\"Osobaya Papka\\", a file which contains about 100,000 Top Secret documents. In this file it is document Nr.103202/06. The paper is signed by Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and the chief of the General Staff at that time Merezkov. It is dated 18 September 1940, three months before the German \\"Operation Barbarossa\\" was signed. After Georgy Zhukov became chief of the general staff in February 1941, the plan was called MP 41 (Mobilisatsyonni Plan 41). Bunich points to the Russian military archives, where it can be found (ZAMO, f. 15A, op.2154, d.4,l. 199-287). This document contains information about the Soviet military power in June 1941: 300 divisions, 8 million soldiers, 27,500 tanks, 32,628 airplanes. The total number of the German warplanes at that time was only about 6,000 although the majority of the Soviet aircraft was obsolete. Bunich is not the only Russian historian who questioned the thesis of the \\"cowardly attack of the Wehrmacht against the peace loving Soviet Union\\". In 1989 appeared the book \\"Ledokol\\" (Icebreaker) by Viktor Suvorov, whose real name was Vladimir Bogdanovich Resun, in which advanced this theory. In February 1992, even the official military-historical Journal of the Russian forces‚Äî\\"Voenno-istorichesky Zhournal\\"‚Äî published an article with the heading \\"Unquestionable Facts of the War's Beginning\\", where a speech by Zhdanov, one of Stalin's intimates, expressed that the Soviet Union had already started an \\"aggressive foreign policy\\" in 1939, with the decision to attack Finland. This article also mentions that the defense efforts of the Soviet Union were impeded by the prevailing aggressive thinking of the Soviet General Staff. These plans were extending to 1943 and to such an extent, that no effective measures against the German assault could be taken. Bunich does not at all intend to polish up the image of Adolf Hitler. His first intention is to analyze who is guilty of having caused the immense human losses of Russia in World War II. He discovered a document, in which the total number of killed Russian soldiers is said to be 30.5 million‚Äî8.5 million of them directly killed in battle, 22 million died after from their wounds, one half of them through tetanus. In Bunich's view Stalin is not the main responsible for these human losses, but Zhukov. Stalin was a statesman but not a soldier, in strategic questions he had to rely on the advice of his generals, and Zhukov was not a very talented one. For example, he gave order to pile up heaps of ammunition under the bare sky in Soviet occupied Poland to a kind of Egyptian pyramids, which could be easily detected by the scout planes of the \\"Fliegerabteilung\\" of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris' \\"Abwehr\\" patrolling over this region as early as a month before the German attack. The Germans got a good picture of this monstrous mass of men and material and later easily destroyed it. Bunich's \\"Operatsia Groza'\\" is full of yet unknown facts about the Third Reich. For example, he reveals why Reinhard Heydrich was replaced as the head of the \\"SD\\" (\\"Sicherheitsdienst\\") by Walter Schellenberg and was made instead the Governor General of Bohemia: This happened because his major rival Admiral Canaris showed Hitler the file of \\"Chaijm Aaron Heydrich\\", Heydrich's grandfather, a first violinist in the Vienna \\"Hofoperette\\" - and who was Jewish. Bunich mentions a remarkable talk between Walter Schellenberg and the Soviet ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Dekanozov, which took place in March 1941. Both men were secret-service veterans and this, in addition to a lot of drinks, created a friendly atmosphere between them. Dekanosov asked Schellenberg: \\"We heard that there exists a plan called Operation Barbarossa which means a German assault against us\\". Schellenberg remained quiet for a while and then said: \\"This is correct, this plan exists and it was elaborated with great thoroughness. We communicated this plan through secret channels to the Americans and the British, to make them believe that we are preparing to attack you. If they believe it, we have a good chance to succeed with our \\"Operation Seel√∂we\\". - But, we also know about Your \\"Operation Grom\\"\\" (\\"Grom\\" means thunder and \\"Grosa\\" thunderstorm). Dekanosov informed Stalin about this talk with Schellenberg - and Stalin decided to believe Schellenberg! Only days before \\"Barbarossa\\" began, it turned out that Merezkov, its author, betrayed \\"Grosa\\" to the Germans. According to Bunich, the German invasion of June 22, 1941 succeeded in the beginning because large segments of the Red Army surrendered or fled into forests and deserted. Adding to the confusion was Stalin's order to initiate the \\"Grosa\\" plan to attack. Also, some people gradually realized that Adolf Hitler and the Germans saw them as \\"sub humans\\" (Untermenschen). On that ground the resistance movement came into being and Stalin was able to lead this war known as the Great Patriotic War. On the backside of the cover of \\"Operatsiya Grosa\\" Bunich mentions that Stalin had decided to start his attack against Western Europe on July 10, 1941.

June 23, 1795, p. 3. Most dictionaries list it as non-standard or incorrect usage, and recommend that \\"regardless\\" should be used instead. Origin The origin of irregardless is not known for certain, but the speculation among dictionary references suggests that it is probably a blend, or portmanteau word, of the standard English words irrespective and regardless. The blend creates a word with a meaning not predictable from the meanings of its constituent morphemes. Since the prefix ir- means \\"not\\" (as it does with irrespective), and the suffix -less means \\"without\\", the word contains a double negative. The word irregardless could therefore be expected to have the meaning \\"in regard to\\", therefore being an antonym, rather than a synonym, of regardless. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), irregardless was first acknowledged in 1912 by the Wentworth American Dialect Dictionary as originating from western Indiana,Murray, James, et al., eds. The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd Ed. Vol. VIII. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989. though the word was in use in South Carolina before Indiana became a territory. The usage dispute over irregardless was such that, in 1923, Literary Digest published an article titled \\"Is There Such a Word as Irregardless in the English Language?\\" The OED goes on to explain the word is primarily a North American colloquialism. Appearance in reference books One way to follow the progress of and sentiments toward irregardless is by studying how it is described in references throughout the twentieth century. Webster's New International Dictionary (2nd. Ed. Unabridged, 1934) described the word as an erroneous or humorous form of regardless, and attributed it to the United States. Although irregardless was beginning to make its way into the American lexicon, it was still not universally recognized and was missing completely from Fowler's Modern English Usage,Fowler, H[enry] W[atson], and Sir Ernest Gowers, eds. Fowler's Modern English Usage. 2nd Ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1965. published in 1965, nor was irregardless mentioned under the entry for regardless. In the last twenty-five years, irregardless has become a common entry in dictionaries and usage reference books, although commonly marked as substandard or dialect. It appears in a wide range of dictionaries including Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged (1961, repr. 2002),Gove, Phillip B., ed. Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged. Springfield, Massachusetts: Merriam-Webster, 1981. The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology (1988), The American Heritage Dictionary (Second College Edition, 1991),Berube, Margery S., ed. The American Heritage Dictionary. 2nd College Ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1991. Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary (2001), and Webster's New World College Dictionary (Fourth Edition, 2004).Agnes, Michael, ed. Webster's New World College Dictionary. 4th Ed. Cleveland, Ohio: Wiley Publishing, 2004. The definition in most dictionaries is simply listed as regardless (along with the note nonstandard, or similar). Merriam‚ÄìWebster even states, \\"Use regardless instead.\\" The Chicago Manual of Style calls irregardless \\"[a]n error\\" and instructs writers to \\"[u]se regardless (or possibly irrespective).\\" Australian linguist Pam Peters (The Cambridge Guide to English Usage, 2004) suggests that irregardless has become fetishized because natural examples of this word in corpora of written and spoken English are greatly outnumbered by examples where it is in fact only cited as an incorrect term. Prescriptive vs. descriptive The approach taken by lexicographers when documenting a word's uses and limitations can be prescriptive or descriptive. The method used with irregardless is overwhelmingly prescriptive. Much of the criticism comes from the double negative pairing of the prefix (ir-) and suffix (-less), which stands in contrast to the negative polarity exhibited by most standard varieties of English. Critics also use the argument that irregardless is not ‚Äì or should not be ‚Äì a word at all, because it lacks the antecedents of a \\"bona fide nonstandard word.\\" A counterexample is provided in ain't, which has an \\"ancient genealogy\\" at which scholars have not leveled such criticisms.Soukhanov, Anne H., ed.

Schultz was the first and only manager for the Seattle Pilots franchise during their lone season before they became the Milwaukee Brewers. Seattle entered the American League as an expansion franchise in 1969, and moved to Wisconsin shortly before the following season. Playing career Born in Chicago, he was the son of a major league baseball player‚ÄîJoe (Germany) Schultz, an outfielder who played for seven of the eight National League clubs (1912‚Äì16; 1919‚Äì25) and who later became a manager in the St. Louis Cardinals' extensive farm system. In 1932, at age 13, Joe Jr. appeared in his first professional game, as a pinch hitter for the Houston Buffaloes of the Class A Texas League; the elder Schultz was managing Houston and Joe Jr. was serving as the Buffaloes' batboy that season.Minorleaguebaseball.com Joe Jr. batted left-handed and threw right-handed; he was listed as tall and . He had a distinguished prep career at St. Louis University High School and signed his first contract with the Cardinals in 1936, but was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, where his father had become minor league director, after the 1939 season. After appearing in only 22 games for Pittsburgh between 1939 and 1941, Schultz made his way back to St. Louis with the Browns of the American League, where he spent six seasons (1943‚Äì48) as a backup catcher and pinch hitter. In 328 major-league at bats over all or parts of nine MLB seasons, Schultz batted .259 with 85 hits, 13 doubles and one home run, struck as a pinch hitter against Pete Gebrian of the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park on August 11, 1947.retrosheet box score: 1947-08-11 Coach for Browns and Cardinals In 1949, Schultz served as a coach with the Browns, and then he managed in the minor leagues from 1950‚Äì62, returning to the Cardinals' organization in 1958. He became a Cardinals coach in 1963 and worked with three National League pennant winners (1964, 1967 and 1968), and two world championship clubs (1964, 1967) through 1968. Manager for Seattle Pilots The success of the Cardinals led to Schultz's 1969 opportunity with the Pilots. Although they were badly outdrafted by their fellow expansion team, the Kansas City Royals, during the player selection lottery, Schultz and general manager Marvin Milkes actually thought the Pilots would finish third in the newly formed American League West. Indeed, Schultz managed to keep his patchwork team within striking distance of .500 for most of the early part of the season. However, a 9‚Äì20 July effectively ended any chance at respectability, and the Pilots finished last in the new West, with a mark of However, it can be argued that Schultz's efforts were hamstrung by the Pilots' off-the-field problems. They played at Sick's Stadium, an aging minor league park that was clearly inadequate even as a temporary facility. The Pilots were also plagued by an unstable, undercapitalized ownership; they were nearly broke by the end of the season. Schultz was relieved of his duties as manager in mid-November, and was replaced by Dave Bristol as the team struggled in limbo during the 1969‚Äì70 offseason. Only weeks before the 1970 season opener, the Pilots were purchased by a group headed by Bud Selig and transferred to Milwaukee, where they have remained since. The Pilots' year of existence was immortalized in Ball Four, the best-selling, controversial memoir of the 1969 season by Seattle pitcher Jim Bouton that was published in 1970. Bouton tells humorous anecdotes about Schultz and some of the motivational speeches he gave to the Pilots. According to Bouton, Schultz's speeches were heavily laced with profanity, even with some original curses (his favorites being the seemingly interchangeable and used for all occasions: \\"shitfuck\\" and \\"fuckshit\\"). The author claims that Schultz was well liked by his team, but some of his choices were questioned by the players. In a later anthology on managers Bouton edited, I Managed Good, But Boy Did They Play Bad, Bouton noted Schultz's sense of humor and added that, given the circumstances of the last-place team, \\"I couldn't have had a better manager than Joe Schultz.\\" Remainder of career Schultz coached with the Royals (1970) and the Detroit Tigers (1971‚Äì76) before leaving baseball. After Billy Martin was fired with 28 games left in the 1973 season, Schultz took over as interim manager for Detroit for the rest of the way, compiling a mark of 14‚Äì14. Counting his interim stint with the Tigers, he had a career record of 78‚Äì112 (.411) as a major league skipper. Apart from that assignment, Schultz never managed in the majors again after the Pilots collapsed.

He is one of the editors of the Bay Psalm Book, the first book published in British North America. His assistant Peter Foulger was the grandfather of Benjamin Franklin. Biography Marker for Thomas Mayhew homestead in Watertown, Massachusetts Thomas Mayhew was born in Tisbury, in the county of Wiltshire in England. He married Anna (also called Hanna and Abigail) Parkhurst, born about 1600, in Hampshire, England, daughter of Matthew Parkhurst. In 1621 they had a son, Thomas, the Younger, baptised in Hanna's home town of Southampton. Two years later they had another child, Robert Mayhew, baptized in Tisbury. The family left England in 1631/2 during the Great Migration of Puritans that brought 20,000 settlers to Massachusetts in thirteen years. Through the agency of Matthew Cradock of London, Mayhew had been appointed to manage properties in Medford, Massachusetts, and to engage in trade and shipbuilding. In or about 1633, Mayhew's wife Anna died, and about 1634 he returned to England for a business meeting with Cradock. While in England, he married Jane Gallion (1602‚Äì1666), and brought her back to New England with him. Their daughter Hannah was born in 1635, and three more daughters, Mary (1639), Martha (1642), and Bethiah, followed. Martha is the world-famous singer and songwriter Taylor Swift's 7th Great- Grandmother.http://famouskin.com/family- group.php?name=27010+taylor+swift&ahnum;=517 In 1641, Thomas secured Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, the Elizabeth Islands, and other islands as a proprietary colony from Sir Ferdinando Gorges and the Earl of Sterling. This enabled him to transfer his business operations there. With the help of his son Thomas, a settlement was established and farming and whaling enterprises were begun. The Mayhews had great success in regard to Indian policy. Because of the fair treatment of the Indians there, the colony was protected from the bloodshed that occurred elsewhere, in King Philip's War. In 1646, the General Court of Massachusetts directed the religious leaders of the colony to select two among them to serve as missionaries to the natives. So great was the interest aroused by this venture that a society was formed in England also to support the missionaries. Unfortunately a massive conflict broke out, called King Philip's War (1675‚Äì76), which resulted in many deaths of both the settlers and the natives. However, three prominent names appear. They are: John Eliot (known as the Apostle to the Indians); Thomas Mayhew (who was already ministering to the natives); and, three generations later, Eleazar Wheelock, who established \\"Doctor Wheelock's Academy for the promotion of Christianity and civility among the savage Indians of this continent\\" (now known as Dartmouth College). In 1657, the younger Thomas Mayhew was drowned when a ship he was travelling in was lost at sea on a voyage to England. Mayhew's three grandsons Matthew Mayhew (1648-), Thomas (1650-), John Mayhew (1652-), and other members of his family assisted him in running his business and government. Transcription of Watertown marker: \\"HERE BY THE ANCIENT FORD THE LANDING AND THE WEIR WAS THE HOMESTALL OF THOMAS MAYHEW: A LEADER IN WATERTOWN AFFAIRS FROM 1635 TO 1645. AFTERWARDS WITH HIS SON, THE REV. THOMAS MAYHEW, HE LABORED AMONG THE INDIANS AT MARTHA'S VINEYARD.\\" Colonizing Dukes County In 1641, while engaged in business ventures in the vicinity of Boston, Mayhew succeeded in acquiring the rights to the islands that now constitute Dukes County and Nantucket County: Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Elizabeth Islands. He bought the County for 40 pounds and two beaverskin hats from William Alexander, the 2nd Earl of Sterling. To resolve a conflicting ownership claim, he also paid off Sir Ferdinando Gorges, thereby acquiring a clear title.Palfrey, John Gorham. History of New England. Little, Brown (1899), Vol. II, pp. 196-97. Mayhew established himself as governor of Martha's Vineyard in 1642 and sent his son, Thomas the Younger, with about forty English families to settle there. He himself followed four years later. Together he and the younger Thomas established Martha's Vineyard's first settlement and called it Great Harbor, now Edgartown. Relations with the natives Mayhew and his fellow settlers found a large and economically stable native population of about 3,000 living in permanent villages, led by four sachems (chiefs). Relations between the first settlers and their Wampanoag neighbors were peaceful and courteous. Under the leadership of his son, a minister, they instituted a policy of respect and fair dealing with the Wampanoag natives that was unequaled anywhere. One of the first of Mayhew's orders was that no land was to be taken from the native islanders, the Wampanoags, without their consent or without fair payment. From this time forward, the colonial settlers and Indians lived without the bloodshed that marked the history of European colonies elsewhere in the New World. From the beginning, Mayhew had worked to preserve the original political institutions of the Indians. Religion and government were distinct matters, he told the Indian chiefs. When one of your subjects becomes a Christian, he is still under your jurisdiction. Indian land was guarded against further encroachment by white settlers. So successful were these policies that during the bloody battles of King Philip's War, in 1675-1676, the Vineyard Indians never stirred, although they outnumbered the English on the island by twenty to one.Wilson, James Grant, and John Fiske, eds. Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography. Appleton & Co. (1900), Vol. IV, pp. 275-76. Spreading religion By 1660 there were about 85 white people living peaceably among the natives, earning their living by farming and fishing. The Mayhew family, which from that time forth became an integral part of island history, wanted to share its religion with the natives, but the Wampanoags were not too interested, having their own spiritual faith. However, once it was clear that, though Mayhew was the governor, the sachems remained in charge of their people, some became curious about the white man's God. When a native named Hiacoomes expressed an interest, Mayhew invited him into his home and instructed him in English and Christianity. Hiacoomes, in return, taught Mayhew the native language. As soon as Mayhew could converse with the natives, he would some days \\"walk 20 miles through uncut forests to preach the Gospel...in wigwam or open field\\".Lloyd Hare, Martha's Vineyard: A Short History and Guide There is a stained glass window in the baptismal font in the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. depicting Rev. Thomas Mayhew Jr. baptizing a native.personal visit Change was in the air though, for the world outside this small island was unsettled. There were more visitors from off island and some stayed, challenging the Mayhew government, while Baptists and Methodists arrived to make converts from the established Congregational Church. From colony to aristocracy Through a maze of conflicting land grants, changing political allegiances, and settler unrest, Mayhew, who styled himself \\"Governour Mayhew\\", began to rule his island with an iron hand. The most serious threat to his control came in 1665 when Martha's Vineyard was included in the lands placed under the king's brother, the Duke of York. After much delay, a settlement, worked out in 1671, confirmed the Mayhew patent and named Mayhew \\"Governour and Chiefe Magistrate\\" for life. At the same time, a patent was issued erecting the Manor of Tisbury in the southwestern part of the island. The Governor and his grandson Matthew were made \\"joint Lords of the Manor of Tisbury,\\" and the inhabitants became manorial tenants subject to the feudal jurisdiction of the Mayhews. This full-fledged feudal manor appears to have been the only such institution actually established in New England. The attempt of the Mayhews to create a hereditary aristocracy on the Vineyard met with increasing opposition as more and more colonists arrived. When the Dutch temporarily recaptured New York in 1673, open rebellion broke out and this lasted until the English regained New York and restored the authority of the Mayhews on the island. The old patriarch died in 1682, at the age of eight-nine. Nine years later the political rule of his family ended when Martha's Vineyard was annexed by Massachusetts after the Glorious Revolution in England, but the manorial land tenure remained. Although some of the Mayhews clung to the \\"pleasant fiction\\" of their manorial rights almost until the American Revolution and received token quit rents as late as 1732, feudalism on Martha's Vineyard died the same slow, lingering but certain death it did elsewhere in the colonies. Missionary work Kenneth Scott Latourette has concluded that the Missionary Mayhews of Martha's Vineyard represent what is probably the longest and most persistent missionary endeavor in the annals of all Christendom. The elder Thomas Mayhew, known for his missionary work, was not concerned for Indian souls when he settled on his island; he sought only to improve his social and economic position. His son, Thomas Mayhew the Younger, is credited with the launching an Indian mission. Like his father, he had emigrated from England. Somewhere, he received a liberal education, apparently from private tutors, and after moving to the Vineyard to begin the white settlement there he became pastor of the small English church as well as acting governor in his father's absence. He soon discovered that he could not refuse the challenge he found among the three thousand Pokanaukets, a branch of the mainland Narragansetts, who far outnumbered the whites, so an effective settlement required friendly relations with the Indians. But Thomas the Younger appears to have been motivated largely by spiritual concern, while his father and other members of the family enjoyed the practical results of the Indian mission. The son gradually abandoned most of his secular tasks and spent the remainder of his life among the natives. Progress was slow at first, but by the end of 1652 there were 283 converts, a school for Indian children, and two Indian meetings each Sabbath. The Praying Indians of Martha's Vineyard who said grace before meals became a topic of conversation on both sides of the Atlantic. Thomas Mayhew the Younger carried on his missionary work with little heed for his personal fortunes. As the elder Mayhew put it, his son had followed this work \\"when 'twas bare with him for food and rayment, and when indeede there was nothing in sight any waies but Gods promises.\\" The situation was improved somewhat by the formation in 1649 of a London missionary society, usually called the New England Company, which in a few years began to provide substantial aid for the Mayhews and other missionaries. In the fall of 1657, Thomas Mayhew the Younger sailed for England on a trip combining an appeal for missionary funds with personal business. After leaving Boston Harbor, the ship was never seen again. The death of his only son at the age of thirty-six was a heavy blow to Mayhew and greatly increased the burdens he carried in old age. He made repeated efforts to find a replacement to continue his son's ministry to the Indians, but no minister who knew the language or was willing to learn could be induced to settle permanently on the island, so at the age of sixty Mayhew, who had started as a merchant, then turned landed proprietor, became a missionary in his son's place. For the next twenty-five years he traveled on foot as far as twenty miles to preach once a week at the Indian assembly or to visit the native camps. Death When the venerable Governor Mayhew became ill one Sunday evening in 1682, he calmly informed his friends and relatives that \\"his Sickness would now be to Death, and he was well contented therewith, being full of Days, and satisfied with Life\\". His great-grandson, Experience Mayhew, a son of John, was only eight at the time, but he clearly remembered being led to the bedside to receive from the dying man a blessing \\"in the Name of the Lord\\". Matthew Mayhew, the eldest grandson, succeeded his military and civil duties. Rev. John Mayhew, the youngest grandson and grandfather of Jonathan Mayhew, continued his missionary work to the Indians. Thomas, another grandson, became a Judge of Massachusetts. His descendant Jonathan Mayhew was a prominent 18th-century Boston clergyman who coined the phrase \\"No taxation without representation.\\" Descendants *Matthew Mayhew (1648‚Äì1710), Martha's Vineyard colonist, politician and missionary *Experience Mayhew (1673‚Äì1758), Martha's Vineyard colonist and missionary *Joseph Mayhew (1709/10‚Äì1782), Martha's Vinceyard colonist, politician, and missionary *Jonathan Mayhew (1720‚Äì1766), Congregationalist minister and Patriot *Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright I (1792‚Äì1854), Episcopal Bishop of New York *Charles Tupper (1821‚Äì1915), 6th Prime Minister of Canada *Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright II (1821‚Äì1863) U.S. Navy officer during the American Civil War *Ella Edes (1832‚Äì1916) American writer, newspaper correspondent, and Catholic activist *Jonathan M.

In the late 19th century, a severe epidemic of clubroot destroyed large proportions of the cabbage crop in St. Petersburg. The Russian scientist Mikhail Woronin eventually identified the cause of clubroot as a \\"plasmodiophorous organism\\" in 1875, and gave it the name Plasmodiophora brassicae. In 18th, 19th and early 20th century Britain clubroot was sometimes called finger and toe, fingers and toes, anbury, or ambury, these last two also meaning a soft tumor on a horse. The potential of cultural practices to reduce crop losses due to clubroot is limited, and chemical treatments to control the disease are either banned due to environmental regulations or are not cost effective. Breeding of resistant cultivars therefore is a promising alternative.Hybrid Vegetable Development, by P. K. Singh (Ed.), S. K. Dasgupta (Ed.), S. K. Tripathi (Ed.), Haworth Press. NC State University Department of Plant Pathology (accessed 27 October 2005)Clubroot in the cole crops: the interaction between Plasmodiophora brassicae and Brassica oleracea In cabbages Cabbage clubroot is a disease of Brassicaceae (mustard family or cabbage family) caused by the soil-borne Plasmodiophora brassicae. The disease first appears scattered in fields, but in successive seasons it will infect the entire field, reducing the yield significantly and sometimes resulting in no yield at all. Symptoms appear as yellowing, wilting, stunting, and galls on the roots. It is transmitted by contaminated transplants, animals, surface water runoff, contaminated equipment, and irrigation water. The pathogen can survive in a field for years as resting spores without a host present and will infect the next crop planted if it is a susceptible host. This pathogen prefers a wet climate and a pH around 5.7, so proper irrigation and the addition of compounds that raise the pH can be used to control this disease. Other control methods include sanitation to prevent transmission, chemical control, and resistant varieties. Hosts and symptoms Cabbage Clubroot affects cabbage, Chinese cabbage, and Brussels sprouts most severely, but it has a range of hosts that it affects less severely like kohlrabi, kale, cauliflower, collards, broccoli, rutabaga, sea kale, turnips, and radishes. Wilting and yellowing of plants in cabbage field. Galls on plant roots. Developing plants may not show any symptoms but as the plants get older they will start to show symptoms of chlorosis or yellowing, wilting during hot days, and exhibit stunted growth. Below ground, the roots experience cell proliferation due to increased auxin or growth hormone production from the plant as well as the pathogen. This causes the formation of galls that can grow big enough to restrict the xylem tissue inhibiting efficient water uptake by the plant. Galls appear like clubs or spindles on the roots. Eventually the roots will rot and the plant will die. Disease cycle In the spring, resting spores in the soil germinate and produce zoospores. These zoospores swim through the moist soil and enter host plants through wounds or root hairs. A plasmodium is formed from the division of many amoeba-like cells. This plasmodium eventually divides and forms secondary zoospores that are once again released into the soil. The secondary infection by the zoospores can infect the first host or surrounding hosts. These secondary zoospores can be transmitted to other fields through farm machinery or water erosion. They form a secondary plasmodium that affects plant hormones to cause swelling in root cells. These cells eventually turn into galls or ‚Äúclubs‚Äù. The secondary plasmodium forms the overwintering resting spores which get released into the soil as the ‚Äúclubs‚Äù rot and disintegrate. These resting spores can live in the soil for up to 20 years while they wait for a root tip to come in close proximity for them to infect. Environment Clubroot is a disease that prefers warmer temperatures and moist conditions. Ideal conditions for the proliferation of this disease would be a soil temperature between 20‚Äì24 ¬∞C and a pH less than 6.5; therefore, this disease tends to be prominent in lower fields where water tends to collect. Management Clubroot is very hard to control. The primary step for management and long-term control is exclusion of the disease. Good sanitation practice is important with regard to the use of tools and machinery in order to prevent the introduction of the pathogen to a disease-free field. It is not uncommon for an inattentive farmer or gardener to unknowingly carry in the pathogen after being previously exposed to it at a different time. One should avoid purchasing infected transplants of cabbage so as to prohibit the infestation of P. brassicae. Soil type is also an important factor in the development and spread of cabbage clubroot; the use of sand will allow for the plants to grow in well-drained soil, thereby eliminating the possibility of the pathogen to proliferate in a hospitable environment. Although it is difficult to eradicate the pathogen once it is introduced to a field, there are several methods for its control. Keeping the soil at a slightly basic pH of 7.1‚Äì7.2 by the addition of agricultural lime as well as the integration of crop rotation will reduce the occurrence of cabbage clubroot in already infected fields. Fumigation using metam sodium in a field containing diseased cabbages is yet another way to decrease the buildup of the pathogen. Control and management practices on already infected fields help to reduce the overall impact that P. brassicae has on a field of cabbage and other cruciferous plants, but it is extremely difficult to rid an individual plant of the disease once it is already infected. Importance Clubroot can be a reoccurring problem for years because it is easily spread from plant to plant. P. brassicae is able to infect 300 species of cruciferous plants, making this disease a recurring problem even with crop rotation. This wide host range allows the pathogen to continue its infection cycle in the absence of cabbages. Additionally, cabbage clubroot may be a stubborn disease due to its ability to form a microbial cyst as an overwintering structure. These cysts may last many years in the soil until it comes into contact with a suitable host, making it difficult to entirely avoid the introduction of the disease. Those growing cabbage need to be aware of the possibility of Plasmodiophora infestation by simply growing in particular fields that may have had cabbage clubroot previously. Canola infestation in Alberta In 2003 clubroot was identified in Alberta, Canada, as an outbreak in canola crops in the central area of the province mainly isolated to the Edmonton area. Clubroot is a soilborne disease caused by the biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassica. The infection causes the formation of large galls on the roots which look like clubs. These formations impede nutrient and water uptake and can cause plant death, wiping out important money generating canola crops. Initially 12 commercial fields of canola were identified, but that number grew to over 400 by 2008. In 2007, Alberta declared P.brassicae a pest via the foundation legislation in hopes to help contain spread of the disease. The Pathotype 3, is the predominant source for Alberta outbreaks. Studies showed that out of the 13 strains of P. brassicae, the most virulent form is dominant in Alberta. Studies have shown that infestation numbers are highest at common field entrances and decline as you move further into the field, away from the entrance. From these results, it was concluded that infested soil on farm machinery was increasing spread of the pathogen. Some natural field to field spread is starting to be seen Liming has been an effective control measure to curb clubroot since the 19th century. This method does not eradicate clubroot but it will slow its development by creating unfavorable conditions. In addition, calcium and magnesium can be added to the nutrition profile of the soil to help control clubroot. To get efficient results the field soil, [pH] must be kept above 7.5. This takes massive applications to field soil in order to treat all of the soil where spores of clubroot are found. Combining lime with one other treatment has shown most effective.Kowata-Dresch, L.S., May-De Milo, L.L. (2012). Clubroot Management of Highly Infested Soils. \\"Crop Protection, 35, p47-52.\\" Several strains of canola have been tried, including European winter canola cv. Mendel (Brassica napus L.), as a clubroot-resistant crop. It has been found that few cultivators exist. Specific genotypes do exist, of the Mendel strain, which could be a solution for canola crops in the Canadian prairies.Rahman, H., Shakir, A., Hasan, MJ. (2011). Breeding for clubroot resistant spring canola (Brassica napus L.) for the Canadian Prairies: Can the European winter canola cv. Mendel be used as a source for resistance. \\" Canadian Journal of Plant Science 91(3), p.447-458.\\" Crop rotation with non-host crops is another method to help prevent clubroot. The half life of P. Brassicae is 3.6 years. Unfortunately, long rotations of approximately 20 years are required in order to be effective. This is very difficult with typical canola rotations not being more than three years. Canola crop brings in high revenue to farmers. This would also require complete removal of Cruciferae crops, such as wild radish and mustard. Some fungicide has been found to help with clubroot but it is very pricey and would take huge amounts to saturate the soil. The best way to prevent contamination between fields is to clean agricultural equipment and vehicles which have come in contact with club root before moving to a new field. All contaminated soil, equipment and tools must not be moved to clean, disease-free fields. The best preventative method is field monitoring. Throughout the season, plants should be monitored for early symptoms of club root. More research is being conducted for early detection of club root in fall soils.Trembly, N., et al. (1999).

Education and career Born in Warsaw, Indiana, Eschbach received a Bachelor of Science degree from Indiana University Bloomington in 1943. He received a Juris Doctor from Indiana University Maurer School of Law in 1949. He was a United States Navy Lieutenant from 1943 to 1946. He was in private practice of law in Warsaw from 1949 to 1962. He served in the Economic Stabilization Agency in Washington, D.C. in 1951. He was a city attorney of Warsaw from 1952 to 1953. He was a deputy prosecuting attorney of 54th Judicial Circuit, Indiana from 1953 to 1954. He was President, secretary and general counsel for Dalton Foundries, Inc. from 1959 to 1962. He was President of Endicott Church Furniture, Inc. from 1960 to 1962. Federal judicial service Eschbach was nominated by President John F. Kennedy on March 12, 1962, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana vacated by Judge Luther Merritt Swygert. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 2, 1962, and received commission on April 13, 1962. He served as Chief Judge from 1974 to 1981. His service was terminated on December 11, 1981, due to elevation to the Seventh Circuit. Eschbach was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on October 20, 1981, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated by Judge Luther Merritt Swygert. He was confirmed by the Senate on November 24, 1981, and received commission on December 1, 1981. He assumed senior status on November 4, 1985. He took inactive senior status on October 1, 2000. His service was terminated on October 25, 2005, due to death. Notable cases One of Eschbach's most controversial decisions as a district judge was in the case of Sparkman v. McFarlin, Civ. No. F 75-129 (ND Ind., May 13, 1976), in which he held that a DeKalb County judge who ordered the sterilization of a young woman without appointing a guardian ad litem to protect her interests or holding a hearing to take evidence in her case could not be sued for damages. Eschbach's decision was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978), now the leading American decision on judicial immunity. Eschbach received national attention in 1981 when he sentenced former Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz to 30 days in federal prison for tax fraud. During the air traffic controllers' strike the same year, he ordered controllers in Fort Wayne to continue working.

Structure  It has four subdivisions: * anterior (VMHa) * dorsomedial (VMHdm) * ventrolateral (VMHvl) * central (VMHc). These subdivisions differ anatomically, neurochemically, and behaviorally.  Function  The ventromedial nucleus (VMN) is most commonly associated with satiety. Early studies showed that VMN lesions caused over-eating and obesity in rats. However, the interpretation of these experiments was summarily discredited when Gold's research demonstrated that precision lesioning of the VMN did not result in hyperphagia. Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown that the immediacy of hyperphagia and obesity syndrome are a consequence of VMN lesions or procaine injections, and point to the VMN's role in satiety. A major review of the subject in 2006 concluded that, \\"anatomical studies done both before and after Gold's study did not replicate his results with lesions, and in nearly every published direct comparison of VMH lesions vs. PVN or VNAB lesions, the group with VMH lesions ate substantially more food and gained twice as much weight.\\" This strongly substantiates the classification of VMN as the primary satiety center in the hypothalamus. It has also been found that lesions to the VMH in rats caused increased plasma insulin levels. Rats with a VMH lesion compared to normal rats overproduce a circulating satiety factor, to which the control rats can respond and rats with a VMH lesion cannot respond. A lesion to the VMH makes rats overproduce leptin, which they cannot respond to causing them to over eat, leading to obesity. Researchers looked at a series of twenty-one animals of various degrees of adiposity, with respect to growth appearance, fat distribution, general physical condition, and the correlation between the level of adiposity attained and the correlation of the hypothalamic lesion. Lesions in the hypothalamic area, particularly the region of the ventromedial hypothalamus interrupts a large number of the descending fibers from the hypothalamic cell groups that were found to contribute to obesity in rats. Another study found that there seems to be a higher concentration of cannabinoid receptor mRNA within the VMH in comparison to other nuclei within the hypothalamus. The cannabinoid ingestion has been linked to rewarding processes, and also with the release of dopamine in the brain. VMH is also important in mammal play behaviour. Lesions to VMH along with the hippocampus, amygdala, the cerebellum, and the lateral hypothalamus are all linked to reduced play The VMHdm has a role in the male vocalizations and scent marking behaviors. The VMHvl plays a role in sexual behaviors in females (lordosis), thus stimulating their sexual arousal. Bilateral FOS expression in the VMH after repeated seizures is associated with alteration in the severity of flurothyl induced seizures in C57BL/6J mice that are not present in DBA/2J mice. Moreover, bilateral lesions of the VMH are able to block the propagation of seizure discharge to enter the brainstem seizure system.

Biography =Playing career= Engel began his career in football at an early age playing at local youth club Junak Wloclawek, before being promoted to local senior team Kujawiak W≈Çoc≈Çawek which allow him to move to the likes of Polonia Warsaw and several other clubs. Engel, nicknamed \\"Jurek\\", began playing in midfield or attack before, at the age of 22, being cruelly forced to cut his career short because of injury. =Coaching and managerial career= First spell in club football With spirits dampened only slightly, he immediately turned to coaching and took over at Polonia Warsaw reserves in the 1975/1976 season. After a spell with third division teams, he came to the fore once more with his involvement in Poland's third-place finish in the 1982 FIFA World Cup Spain, helping then national coach, Antoni Piechniczek, choose the ideal squad. In 1985 Jurek took over at Legia Warsaw, leading them to two second-place finishes in the Polish Championship in three seasons. Just as he was becoming well known he made the strange decision to move to Apollon Limassol, in Cyprus, an island he stayed on for seven years. He later returned to Legia before taking Polonia Warsaw to runners-up spot in 1998‚Äì99. National team spell He became manager of the Polish national team in 1999 and after failing to achieve qualification for the UEFA Euro 2000, was instrumental in securing Emmanuel Olisadebe's naturalisation as a Polish national. With the side lacking firepower when he took charge, Engel saw the qualities in Nigerian-born Olisadebe who was already playing his league football in Poland. He asked the president to speed Olisadebe's papers through and as a result, had a talented forward available for World Cup qualifying. Olisadebe rewarded his coach with eight goals in ten qualifying matches. Engel steered Poland to their first World Cup finals tournament since 1986, when he oversaw their participation at the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/low/team_pages/poland/newsid_2040000/2040830.stm The World Cup did not go well and Poland were eliminated in the first round. The opening two games provided two resounding defeats losing to South Korea and Portugal. After being knocked out of the tournament and now without any pressure to perform, Poland beat the United States in their final group game for a famous victory. Second spell in club football His most recent vocation was at Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w where he was trainer until late-October 2005 and he has also been sports director of Legia Warsaw. In December 2005, he moved back in Cyprus and headed the coaching team of APOEL. He led the team into the third place of the Cypriot Championship, just two points from the top, and won the Cypriot Cup as well. =Directorial career= On 25 June 2015 \\"Polonia Warsaw Co.\\" under the leadership of Jerzy Engel took over the senior team from the MKS Polonia Warsaw Academy, which helped to reinstate Polonia Warsaw back from nonexistence, to the bottom-half of the 4th tier (third league) of professional football in Poland.

As an M.P. he published a letter on the reasonableness of the Stamp Act, 1765, which earns him a place in the events that led to the American Revolution. Life He was the eldest son of Thomas Whately of Epsom, Surrey and educated at Clare College, Cambridge (1745). He entered the Middle Temple in 1742 to study law and was called to the bar in 1751. He was an elder brother of the cleric Joseph Whately of Nonsuch Park, Surrey, and thus the uncle of Richard Whately. For many years he was in the close confidence of George Grenville, to whom he passed the political gossip. He also corresponded with Lord Temple, Lord George Sackville, and James Harris, M.P. Whately sat in parliament from 1761 to 1768 for the borough of Ludgershall in Wiltshire, and from 1768 until his death he represented the borough of Castle Rising in Norfolk. From 5 April 1764 until its dismissal in July 1765 he held the post of secretary to the treasury in George Grenville's administration, before going into opposition. On Grenville's death in November 1770 Whately attached himself to Lord North, and acted as the go-between for his old patron's friends. Junius denounced him as possessing \\"the talents of an attorney\\" and \\"the agility of Colonel Bodens\\" (who could scarcely move), and for deserting Grenville's cause. He was appointed a commissioner on the board of trade in January 1771, the keeper of his Majesty's private roads in January 1772, and under-secretary of state for the northern department in June 1771. These appointments he held for the rest of his life. Whately died unmarried and intestate on 26 May 1772; his brother, William Whately, a banker in Lombard Street, London, administered to the effects. Political writings Whately was the author of Remarks on \\"The Budget,\\" or a Candid Examination of the Facts and Arguments in that Pamphlet (1765), rebutting David Hartley's attack on Grenville's financial schemes, and he also defended his chief in Considerations on the Trade and Finances of the Kingdom and on the Measures of the Administration since the Conclusion of the Peace (3rd edit. 1769). Whately has sometimes been credited with the authorship of a pamphlet on the Present State of the Nation (1768; appendix, 1769), but it was drawn up, under Grenville's supervision, by William Knox. A second pamphlet, The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies reviewed (1769), attributed to him and included in John Almon's Collection of Tracts on Taxing the British Colonies in America (vol. iii. 1773), was also written by Knox. Observations on Modern Gardening Among gardeners, Whately is largely remembered as the author of Observations on Modern Gardening, illustrated by descriptions (London, 1770), written while living in the Mansion House in Nonsuch Park. Close on the heels of George Mason's Essay on Design in Gardening, Whately's Observations provide the most comprehensive work on the theory and practice of English landscape gardening in the naturalistic taste before Horace Walpole's brief Essay on Modern Gardening (1782) and the writings of Humphry Repton. The picturesque landscape style in the manner of idealized landscapes by Salvator Rosa or Claude Lorrain, had been pioneered by Charles Bridgeman in the 1720s, improved by William Kent and eventually dominated by Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown, but neither had put their thoughts into print. By 1783, polymath Thomas Jefferson, the future third President of the United States, already had a copy of Whately's book in his library at Monticello.Thomas Jefferson Papers, 1783 Catalog of Books, [circa 1775-1812], p. 174 During his European years as Minister to France, he also visited England. Eager to explore and gain practical knowledge for his own garden designs, in April 1786, Jefferson set out for a tour of English gardens in the company of his close friend and future second President of the US, John Adams. Whately's treatise guiding him every step of the way, Jefferson's near contemporary statement attests to the accuracy and reliability of Whately's description: > Memorandums made on a tour to some of the gardens in England described by > Whateley in his book on gardening. While his descriptions in point of style > are models of perfect elegance and classical correctness, they are as > remarkeable for their exactness. I always walked over the gardens with his > book in my hand, examined with attention the particular spots he described, > found them so justly characterised by him as to be easily recognised, and > saw with wonder, that his fine imagination had never been able to seduce him > from the truth.The Papers of Thomas Jefferson Digital Edition, ed. Barbara > B. Oberg and J. Jefferson Looney. Charlottesville: University of Virginia > Press, Rotunda, 2008, pp. 369. Online edition accessed 14 Aug 2012. Whately's work went through several editions. Translations in German and French appeared as early as 1771. Remarks on Some of the Characters in Shakespeare Whately's Remarks on Some of the Characters in Shakespeare was left unfinished at his death and published posthumously by his brother, the Rev. Joseph Whately, in 1785. Whately's analysis of several of Shakespeare's principal characters applies to them the principles of psychology and motivation of Whately's own proto-Romantic sensibilities. Hutchinson Letters Affair : After Whately's death, correspondence directed to him from Thomas Hutchinson, governor of Massachusetts, Lieutenant-Governor Oliver and other British colonial agents was leaked to Benjamin Franklin. They were later published in Boston, causing great scandal, and eventually involving his brother William Whately in a duel. \\"These letters, though not official, related wholly to public affairs, and were intended to affect public measures. They were filled with representations, in regard to the state of things in the colonies, as contrary to the truth, as they were insidious in their design. The discontents and commotions were ascribed to a factious spirit among the people, stirred up by a few intriguing leaders; and it was intimated, that this spirit would be subdued, and submission to the acts of Parliament would be attained, by the presence of a military force, and by persevering in the coercive measures already begun.\\"Jared Sparks, Life of Benjamin Franklin, Chapter VII: the Hutchinson correspondence Other notable facts At the insistence of Hutchinson, then acting governor, the town of Whately, Massachusetts was named for him when it was set apart from Hatfield in 1771.Whately Retrieved 16 August 2007 References External links * Biography of Thomas Whately in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography * Thomas Whately, The Regulations lately Made concerning the Colonies and the Taxes Imposed upon Them, Considered (London, 1765): Whately's observations on the Stamp Act: \\"this Mode of Taxation is the easiest, the most equal and the most certain that can be chosen; The Duty falls chiefly upon Property; but it is spread lightly over a great Variety of Subjects, and lies heavy upon none.\\" * Thomas Whately, Observations on Modern Gardening * Thomas Whately, Remarks on Some of the Characters in Shakespeare (e-books text) * ;Attribution Category:1726 births Category:1772 deaths Category:Alumni of Clare College, Cambridge Category:Members of the Middle Temple Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1761‚Äì1768 Category:British MPs 1768‚Äì1774 Category:English garden writers ","title":"Thomas Whately"},{"id":"3013618","text":"Ilmari Kianto portrayed on a postage stamp published in 1974.

Hayden, Scribner's Monthly, June 1873, Vol 6, No. 2, p. 137 Cayuse is an archaic term used in the American West, originally referring to a small landrace horse, often noted for unruly temperament. The name came from the horses of the Cayuse people of the Pacific Northwest. The term came to be used in a derogatory fashion to refer to any small, low-quality horse, particularly if owned by indigenous people or a feral horse. Later the term was applied a people of villainous reputation. In British Columbia, the variant word cayoosh refers to a particular breed of powerful small horse admired for its endurance. One theory of the origin of the word ‚ÄúCayuse‚Äù is that it derives from the French \\"cailloux,\\" meaning stones or rocks. The name may have referred to the rocky area the Cayuse people inhabited or it may have been an imprecise rendering of the name they called themselves. Another is that it is a Native American adaptation of the Spanish caballo, with the -s ending a noun form in Salishan languages. A variant adaptation, kiuatan, with a Sahaptian -tan ending, is the main word for \\"horse\\" or \\"pony\\" in the Chinook Jargon, although cayuse or cayoosh was also used in some areas. > \\"The little ponies, which take their name from the Cayuse Indians, posess as > a native quality, this habit of bucking, or jumping high in the air as we > have lambs do, sriking with every joint stiffened, all four feet forcibly > upon the earth.

Hart calls the villain a \\"cayuse\\" in the title cards.Tumbleweeds Directed by King Baggot, 1925, screenplay C. Gardner Sullivan from a story by Hal G, Evarts In popular culture Horses identified as ‚Äúcayuses‚Äù in literature include Nimpo and Stuyve, who were depicted in Richmond P. Hobson, Jr.'s book Grass Beyond The Mountains. Both horses had been captured by a local Native American named Thomas Squinas near Nimpo Lake in the Chilcotin District of British Columbia. Hobson described the two cayuses as the best horses that he owned, because of their unrelenting spirit and hardiness that helped them survive the extreme conditions in northern British Columbia. There is also an example in John Steinbeck's book, The Red Pony. In \\"Don't Fence Me In\\", a popular American song written in 1934 by Cole Porter and Robert Fletcher, is the line \\"On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder...'.The Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter, Knopf, 1983 It was recorded by Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Clint Eastwood, Willie Nelson and Leon Russell, among many others. The 1953 film Tumbleweed features a horse with that name, whose quirky personality, sure-footedness, and relationship with the human protagonist (Jim Harvey, played by Audie Murphy) help to drive the plot. Harvey refers to Tumbleweed several times as a \\"Cayuse\\" in a derogatory way, but over the course of the film Tumbleweed proves to be a much better horse than his lowly appearance at first suggested.

Le propre neveu du compositeur, Andr√©-Joseph Gr√©try, et un autre editions.cmbv.fr. He was born as son of Francois de Gerlache and Margarethe de Groulart. He studied law in Paris and practised there for some time, but settled at Li√®ge after the establishment of the kingdom of the Netherlands. As member of the states-general he was an energetic member of the opposition, and, though he repudiated an ultramontane policy, he supported the alliance of the extreme Catholics with the Liberal party, which paved the way for the revolution of 1830. On the outbreak of disturbance in August 1830 he still, however, thought the Orange-Nassau dynasty and the union with the Dutch states essential; but his views changed, and, after holding various offices in the provisional government, he became president of congress, and brought forward the motion inviting Leopold of Saxe-Coburg to become king of the Belgians. In 1832 he was president of the chamber of representatives, and for thirty-five years he presided over the court of appeal. He presided over the Catholic congresses held at Mechelen between 1863 and 1867. That his early Liberal views underwent some modification is plain from the Conservative principles enunciated in his Essai sur le mouvement des partis en Belgique (Brussels, 1852). As an historian his work was strongly colored by his anti-Dutch prejudices and his Catholic predilections. His Histoire des Pays-Bas depuis 1814 jusquen 1830 (Brussels, 2 vols., 1839), which reached a fourth edition in 1875, was a piece of special pleading against the Dutch domination. The most important of his other works were his Histoire de Li√®ge (Brussels, 1843) and his √âtudes sur Salluste et sur quelques-uns des principaux historiens de l'antiquit√© (Brussels, 1847). In 1831, he was elected in Li√®ge for the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, of which he was president until 1832. Later on, he became the first 1st president of the Belgian Court of Cassation, a position he occupied until 1867. He died on 10 February 1871 in Ixelles.

TFAH also offers a series of recommendations to further strengthen America's emergency preparedness. In the 2017 report, TFAH concluded that the reduction in federal and state funding for public health over the past 15 years has left many states unprepared to respond to bioterrorism, outbreaks of infectious diseases and natural disasters. The report uses 10 \\"key indicators\\" to measure the public health preparedness of each state. For 2017, 25 states received a score of 5 or lower.

He compiled a biographical encyclopedia of notable physicians, from the Greeks, Romans and Indians up to the year 650AH/1252AD in the Islamic era. Biography Ibn Abi Usaibia was born at Damascus, a member of the Banu Khazraj tribe. The son of a physician, he studied medicine at Damascus and Cairo. In 1236 he was appointed physician to a new hospital in Cairo, but the following year he took up an offer by ruler of Damascus, of a post in Salkhad, near Damascus, where he lived until his death. His only surviving work is Lives of the Physicians. In that work he mentions another of his works, but it has not survived. Lives of the Physicians The title in Arabic, Uy≈´n ul-AnbƒÅ æ fƒ´ ·π¨abaqƒÅt al-A·π≠ibbƒÅ (), is translatable loosely and expansively as \\"Sources of News on Classes of Physicians\\", commonly translated into English as History of Physicians, Lives of the Physicians, Classes of Physicians, or Biographical Encyclopedia of Physicians).Roger Pearse (2011), Preface to the Online Edition -- the online edition of the Arabic-to-English translation of Ibn Abi Usaibia's History of Physicians, translated by Lothar Kopf. The book opens with a summary of the physicians from ancient Greece, Syria, India and Rome but the main focus of the book's 700 pages is physicians of medieval Islam. A first version appeared in 1245‚Äì1246 and was dedicated to the Ayyubid physician and vizier Amƒ´n al- Dawlah. A second and enlarged recension of the work was produced in the last years of the life of the author, and circulated in at least two different versions, as shown by the extant manuscripts. =Editions= The text has been published five times in all. When the first edition by August M√ºller (Cairo, 1882), published under the pseudonym \\"Imr≈´ l-Qays\\",Cairo, 1882 was found to be marred by typos and errors and a corrected version was subsequently issued (K√∂nigsberg, 1884).K√∂nigsberg, 1884 Relying on M√ºller's work, Ni·∫ìƒÅr Ri·∏çƒÅ published a non-critical edition of the text in Beirut in 1965, which was subsequently reworked by QƒÅsim WahhƒÅb for yet another edition issued in Beirut in 1997.  øƒÄmir al-NajjƒÅr published his own critical edition (not based on M√ºller) in Cairo in 1996. A team of scholars from the universities of Oxford and Warwick has published a new critical edition and a full annotated English translation of the Uy≈´n al-AnbƒÅ. Their work is available in Open Access at Brill Scholarly Editions. Older editions remain available. An electronic version of the Arabic text can be consulted online at AlWaraq.net.

Hamilton moved to Brighton in 2000 and in 2002 was recruited to play keyboards for British Sea Power live. The band were reportedly impressed that--without warning and during a song without keyboards--Eamon went off into the crowd banging a drum. Due to touring commitments with Brakes, Hamilton left British Sea Power in January 2006. Hamilton has recorded and played live under a number of different guises. One of his main projects was Brighter Lunch, also featuring Matt Eaton, now of Actress Hands. In August 2002, Tom and Alex White of The Electric Soft Parade saw Hamilton performing solo and offered to play guitar and drums, respectively, with him. They were joined by Marc Beatty, of Mockin' Bird Studios and The Tenderfoot, to play bass. Brakes was born. Their debut single, Pick Up the Phone, was released in 2004 on Tugboat Records and an album, Give Blood, followed in July 2005. In October 2006 they released their second album The Beatific Visions.

Christianity: good and evil This concept can be contrasted with natural evil, in which a bad event occurs naturally, without the intervention of an agent. The dividing line between natural and moral evil is not absolutely clear however, as some behaviour can be unintentional yet morally significant and some natural events (for example, global warming) can be caused by intentional actions. The distinction of evil from 'bad' is coex. Evil is more than simply 'negative' or 'bad' (i.e. undesired or inhibiting good) as evil is on its own, and without reference to any other event, morally incorrect. The validity of 'moral evil' as a term, therefore, rests on the validity of morals in ethics.

The service, a joint venture between BSkyB and ITV franchise Scottish Television owners SMG plc (now STV Group plc), was aimed at Scots living outside Scotland who would not otherwise be able to receive Scottish programming, such as that transmitted within Scotland by Scottish Television, Grampian Television or BBC Scotland. It broadcast between 6.00 pm and 8.00 pm. The station's main programmes included an extra edition of Scottish Television's regional news programme Scotland Today and episodes of Take the High Road from 1994. Celtic F.C.'s 1997 pre-season friendlies were shown on the channel. Scotsport was also shown on the channel as well as spin- off show Extra Time. There was also The Football Show presented by Jim Delahunt and Peter McGuire. Despite BSkyB and SMG entering into a seven-year contract to run the service, Sky Scottish was closed down after 18 months. Its closure was explained as the channel having failed to meet its financial targets. Reports suggested that only The Ibrox Club Hour and The Celtic Park Hour, programmes relating to Rangers and Celtic football clubs, had attracted more than 10,000 viewers. Speaking about its demise, the managing director of SMG at the time, Donald Emslie, described the service as having \\"been a valuable learning experience\\" for his company. SMG's finance director, Gary Hughes, stated that the service had shown \\"it is very difficult to access a Scottish audience outside Scotland,\\" but also that Scottish audiences wanted more home-grown programmes.

He lives in San Francisco. Career Prior to founding Meat Beat Manifesto together in 1987, Jack Dangers and Jonny Stephens were members of a short-lived group Perennial Divide. While Stephens remained a member for several years, Jack Dangers is the only person credited as a member of the band on every Meat Beat Manifesto release. In addition to his career with Meat Beat Manifesto, Jack Dangers has also contributed other projects. Along with Ben Stokes (DHS-(Dimensional Holofonic Sound)) and Mike Powell and he is a part of unusual breakbeat combo known simply as Tino. Tino's material is released through their independent label, Tino Corp. Another collaboration called Loop Finder General was announced at one time, but the only recording that has surfaced under this name is a track on ¬°Hello Friends!, a Jack Dangers DJ mix album primarily featuring Tino material. As a remixer and producer, Dangers has collaborated with and reworked material for David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, David Byrne, DJ Spooky, Merzbow, Depeche Mode, Coil, dubLoner, and many others. Dangers is an avid collector of obscure audio and video material, and frequently employs samples from his collection of records and videotapes in his music and during live shows. Dangers also collects vintage electronic hardware; he owns an EMS Synthi 100 modular system that he claims is the only known working model. This unit is featured prominently on RUOK?, released in 2002. An activist for animal rights and a practising vegetarian, Dangers has contributed (as part of Meat Beat Manifesto) to two benefit compilations for In Defense of Animals. He credits his active concern for these issues to fellow musicians Consolidated, for whom he has produced several albums and done a number of remixes.

The other long used class of Nemertea are the Enopla (for changes in taxonomy, see reference from 2019). Although Anopla is a paraphyletic grouping, it is used in almost all Scientific classifications. Anopla is divided into two orders: Palaeonemertea and Heteronemertea. Norenburg, J.; Gibson, R.; Herrera Bachiller, A.; Strand, M. (2019). World Nemertea Database. Anopla. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=1293 on 2019-11-07 Palaeonemertea may be para- or polyphyletic, consisting of 3-5 groupings and totalling about 100 species. These worms have several apparently simple features and, as their name suggests, they are often considered to be the most primitive nemerteans. The primary body-wall musculature consists of an outer circular stratum overlying a longitudinal stratum. The group includes genera such as Cephalothrix in which the nerve cords are inside the body-wall longitudinal muscle, and Tubulanus, in which the nerve cords are between the outer circular muscle and the epidermis. Tubulanids are commonly encountered in rocky areas of intertidal zones in the northern hemisphere. They are often bright orange or have very distinctive banding and or stripes and can be many meters long, although only a few mm thick. Heteronemertea is a monophyletic grouping of about 500 species, containing genera such as Lineus and Cerebratulus and including the largest and most muscular nemerteans. Almost all heteronemerteans have three primary body-wall muscle strata, an outer longitudinal, middle circular, and inner longitudinal. The lateral nerve cords are outside the circular muscle, as in palaeonemerteans, but separated from the epidermis by the usually well-developed outer longitudinal muscle. A third subclass of Anopla called the Archinemertea was determined to be paraphyletic and is no longer used by most authors. A trace fossil genus called Archisymplectes from the Pennsylvanian found in central Illinois was formerly placed in this subclass, but is now considered a Palaeonemertea, if indeed it is an Anopla.

Career =Newcastle United= Bates joined his hometown club Newcastle United at the age of 8 in 1993. He worked his way through the ranks, setting several junior goalscoring records during that time and playing alongside good friend and fellow academy graduate Steven Taylor. With a view to progressing all the way to the first team, Bates played in the Newcastle Youth team until 2004, with his goal taking the team to the final 16 in the 2003‚Äì04 FA Youth Cup. The following season, Bates found a regular spot in the Reserves team, making 15 appearances and scoring 6 goals in the 2004‚Äì05 season. Promotion into the first team proved significantly more difficult for Bates, however, as he was fighting for a place behind established strikers such as Alan Shearer, Shola Ameobi and Patrick Kluivert. =Newcastle United Jets= The lack of opportunities for Bates led him to seek a release from Newcastle and head to Australia in January 2005, where he had a trial with Newcastle United Jets. Two months later, in March, Bates signed a two-year deal with the newly established club, and spoke publicly about the possibility of a long-term stay in Australia. Bates played and scored regularly in the Jets' pre-season campaign, but did not make his A-League debut until round 4 of the competition, playing 64 minutes in a 4‚Äì0 victory over New Zealand Knights. The match was one of just three appearances Bates made in the 2005‚Äì06 season, and in November 2005, Bates was released by the club by mutual agreement, citing a lack of match time for wanting to leave. Bates returned home to England in the hope of joining another club during the European January transfer window. =Darlington= Bates trialled at both English League Two club Darlington and Belgian club K.V. Mechelen, receiving an offer from the latter after scoring a hat-trick in a trial game. He turned it down however, to play in his home country with Darlington, for whom he had already scored for in a trial match against Hartlepool United. Bates officially joined Darlington on 3 February 2006, signing a short-term deal until June 2006. Bates made his Darlington league debut the day after signing, coming on as a substitute in the team's 0‚Äì0 draw with Boston United. Despite being unable to find the back of the net in that match, it took Bates just 10 minutes into his next appearance to score his first Darlington goal, in a 2‚Äì0 reserves win against Hull City. Over the remainder of the season, Bates could not find a regular starting spot in the Darlington line-up, and played just nine games for one goal as the team finished 8th in the league. Bates was released by the club in May 2006,. He then played for KV Oostende in the Belgian Second Division. =Drogheda United= Bates signed for League of Ireland Premier Division leaders Drogheda United 31 July 2007. He scored the winner against Cork City which won the title for Drogheda for the first time ever in October 2007. Bates played for R.A.A. Louvi√©roise in the third division of Belgium before rejoining Drogheda on 8 July 2009 =Glenavon= On 7 July 2012, Bates signed a one-year contract with Irish League side Glenavon. Throughout the 2013‚Äì14 season, Bates enjoyed a good run of form, scoring over 20 goals, securing a top-6 finish for the Lurgan club along with the club's first Irish Cup since 1997. Despite earlier signing a two-year contract extension, Bates was to leave Glenavon on 31 August 2014 in order to emigrate to Australia. Bates played his last match for Glenavon on 31 August 2014 as a late sub in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Ballymena United but remained in contract with the club until June 2016 and therefore could rejoin the club when he returned to Northern Ireland. =Linfield= However, in June 2015 Linfield bought out the rest of Bates contract with Glenavon, becoming their fourth signing of the summer. Linfield manager Warren Feeney said Bates was a player he always admired, however Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton said he was let down by the player's decision to renege on the verbal agreement he had made. Bates found first-team opportunities at Linfield limited after David Healy succeeded Feeney as manager, and on 22 June 2016, it was announced that Bates' contract would be terminated by mutual consent. =Second spell at Glenavon= Bates resigned for the Lurgan Blues on a one-year deal on 19 July 2016, the same day former Celtic and Northern Ireland winger Paddy McCourt signed for the club. Bates left the club at the end of his contract.

Woodland was incorporated in 1842 by John Whitten Van Cleve, the first male child born in Dayton.Zumwald 36 He was the son of Benjamin Van Cleve and Mary Whitten Van Cleve. The cemetery began with southeast of Dayton and has been enlarged to its present size of . Over 3,000 trees and 165 specimens of native Midwestern trees and woody plants grace the rolling hills. Many of the trees are more than a century old and 9 have been designated \\"Ohio Champions.\\" The highest point in Dayton is within the cemetery, and during the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, it became a place of refuge. The Romanesque gateway, chapel and office, completed in 1889, are on the National Register of Historic Places. The buildings were constructed of the stone from the original cemetery wall. The chapel has one of the finest original Tiffany windows in the country. A mausoleum, with a rock and bronze exterior, features twenty-two varieties of imported marble and twelve large stained glass windows inspired by famous literary works. It was added in 1970. The oldest original 105-acre section of the cemetery, known as \\"Victorian,\\" received a second designation as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. A receiving vault large enough to contain 12 crypts was built in 1847 by Joseph Wuichert, who was said to be Dayton's premier stonemason. Throughout the 19th century it was used for temporary storage when burials were delayed due to bad weather or for other reasons (for example, refer to the article below on Levi and Matilda Stanley). Located near the main entrance to the cemetery and across from the mausoleum, it is constructed of giant limestone slabs and was designed as a replica of the Egyptian-style temple of Thebes and Karnak. It was unused for nearly 100 years but the exterior was restored in 2008 to its original condition. Notable burials The Wright Brothers plot The monuments, ranging from rugged boulders to Greek statues and temples, memorialize the lives of people who helped shape the nation and the city.

Grenadier Models Inc. is best known for their figures for TSR, Inc.'s Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, collectible Dragon-of-the-Month and Giants Club figures, and their marketing of paint and miniature sets through traditional retail outlets. The company began as a basement enterprise, but by 1983 they had grown to a staff of 50 people and had the third highest gross sales in the expanding gaming market.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.10, Fall 1983, Scott Slingsby, editor. Grenadier's sculptors included John Dennett, Janine Bennett, Julie Guthrie, Robert Watts, Nick Lund, Mark Copplestone, Michael Daley, Sandra Garrity, Bob Naismith, William Watt and Ian Symonds. Grenadier closed its doors in 1996, but many of their products remain in production by companies in the UK, Italy and the United States. History The company was founded by Andrew Chernak, president and head sculptor, and Ray Rubin, vice president and head artist. Chernak and Rubin had previously partnered in Canterbury Pewter Ltd., a gift-market sculpting business which they had established in 1972. The duo were not new to historical miniatures. Chernak had previously sculpted for Superior Models and Rubin was a co-founder of Squadron-Rubin Miniatures. Grenadier Model's first product was a line of 25mm American Revolution figures released in anticipation of the 1976 United States Bicentennial. The company received its name from their first miniature, a grenadier.The Grenadier Bulletin vol. 1.4, Spring 1982, Kim Eastland, editor In partnership with its European distributor, Grenadier formed Grenadier Models Ltd UK in 1984. By 1991, the British office became the center of the company's design and development. Grenadier Models published a product catalog in 1978, 1979, 1982 and annually from 1985 to 1994. Separate European catalogs were published in 1985, 1994, and perhaps other years as well. Their products were discussed in the Grenadier Bulletin, a magazine which also contained games, comics, short- stories, and puzzles. The bulletin was published in several series. The first series contained issues #1 through #18 and were released between the fall of 1981 and late 1987. A new series of four editions was issued in late 1991 and early 1992 in the form of a full-color magazine. A third series, somewhat confusingly labeled \\"volume II,\\" was produced in the summer of 1993, but appears to have been terminated after a single issue. Grenadier's British offices produced a separate \\"International edition\\" of the bulletin called the British Grenadier. There were at least thirteen issues and it appears to have been produced around 1988. The British offices also published a bi-monthly newsletter Warrior: The Newsletter for Fantasy Wargamers which supported Grenadier's Fantasy Warrior game.Warrior #1, December 1992/ January 1993, Derek Mugridge, editor. The Warrior included thirteen issues published from December 1992 / January 1993 to April / May 1995.Warrior #13, April / May 1995, Derek Mugridge, editor. =Historical miniatures, 1975-1980= By the end of 1976, Grenadier had produced miniature soldiers from Classical Antiquity and the American Civil War, and American Old West gunfighters. Although they were primarily focused on the well-established market for historical miniatures, their early products included science fiction themed Starsoldiers (product codes #S01-19) and Space Squadrons: Stellardate 2998 (#SS01-SS19) spaceships, 25mm fantasy figures called Wizzards & Warriors (W1-60, WS1-5), a Special Sets line of furniture (#WS01-WS12), and a small selection of 15mm fantasy figures.Dragon Magazine #10, 1977The Book of Fantasy Miniatures by Ed Konstant, Little Soldier Games, 1978 As the fantasy and science fiction market began to out-pace historical miniatures in 1978, Grenadier released box sets containing select portions of their fantasy, space ships, and gunslinger lines.The Fantastic Worlds of Grenadier, Terence Gunn (2003), published by the authorJudge's Guild Dungeoneer Compendium #1-6, 1979, page 50 In 1980 these boxed sets included fantasy game oriented Dungeon Adventure (WW01) and Monsters Sets (WW02), Western Gunfighters (WW03), and Space Squadrons Set (WW04). New figures were crafted for the Gamma World Adventure (WW06), Gamma World Denizens (WW07), Woodland Adventurers (WW08), and Tomb of Spells Sets (WW09).\\"Light Brigade Hobbies Catalog #2, Concord, California, 1980 The new lines attracted the attention of TSR, Inc. who produced the Gamma World and Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games and began a short, but lucrative partnership between Grenadier and TSR, Inc.. =\\"Your D. & D. Figure Company,\\" 1981-1982= In the fall of 1981 Grenadier Models had begun to refer to itself as \\"Your D. & D. Figure Company\\" and began a newsletter The Grenadier Bulletin to advertise its status as the official producer of miniatures for TSR, Inc.'s AD&D; and Gamma World role-playing games.The Grenadier Bulletin vol. 1.1, Fall 1981, Kim Eastland, editor Its first editor Kim Eastland became an influential author of role-playing games and fiction published by TSR, Inc.. The AD&D; lines included blister packs of monsters (#101-116), small box sets (#2001-2013), and large box sets (#5001-5004, 5009). A collateral product was Action Art box sets (#8001-8004) which included paints and painting instructions and served to introduce customers to the hobby. The Gamma World role-playing game was supported by a series of blister packs (Gxx), a box sets of adventurers (#5005) and post- apocalyptic monsters (#5006). Grenadier also produced figures (SN1-4) for TSR's Snit's Revenge board game.Grenadier's Consumer Catalogue 1982 In late 1982 Grenadier Models and TSR, Inc. ended their business relationship.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.6, Winter 1982, Scott Slingsby, editor. The point of contention was Grenadier's plans to produce figures for other game companies. Grenadier later described the separation as \\"a bold decision... in order to provide players of all fantasy games with a broader range of quality fantasy miniatures\\".The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.16, Don Wellman, editor. Since many of Chernak's sculptures predated TSR, Inc.'s artwork, Grenadier Models retained the rights to many of their sculptures and re-released choice figures in the Dragon Lords (#2001-2013, 5001-5004), Fantasy Lords (#6001-6005, 101-112), and Action Art (#8003, 8004) lines. There appear to have been continued issues with the reuse of the sculpts which might have resembled images which TSR, Inc. considered trademarked. Parts of some sets (#2010-2012, 8003, 8004) were replaced with new sculpts.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.8, Summer 1983, Scott Slingsby, editor In 1982 and 1983 Grenadier conducted a Wizard's Gold Contest in which they placed gold-plated castings within random boxes of figures. The box also included a certificate for a drawing. The grand prize for 1982 was a one-half ounce of gold for the purchaser of the box set and the store which sold it. The 1983 certificates awarded gift certificates and were placed in 6001 - Dragons of the Emerald Idol and 6002 - Skeleton-Raiders of the Undead box sets. However, collectors have reported gold-plated figures from other contemporaneous sets. =\\"Collect and Paint,\\" 1983-1990= As Grenadier parted ways with TSR, Inc. they continued to reach out to the burgeoning adventure gaming market. In 1983 they became the official producer of miniatures for Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu (#6501, 6502), and Game Designers' Workshop's Traveller (#1001-1003). In 1983 Grenadier announced an agreement to produce miniatures for FASA's Star Trek role playing game, but the figures were produced by Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc., RAFM in 1985, and Rawcliffe Pewter from 1989 to 1999. At that same time the owners of Grenadier Models spun off a subsidiary called Pinnacle Products with an orientation toward mainstream retail outlets. They produced The Dark Crystal Adventure Collection which included two boxed sets (#9001, 9002, note reuse of product code) containing paints and miniatures of the characters and furniture in the December 1982 movie The Dark Crystal. Other Pinnacle Products merchandise included the Paint and Collect Series consisting of 2201 - Dinosaurs, 2202 - Fantasy Lords, 2203 - Fantasy Monsters, and 2204 - G.I. Assault Team. In early 1983 Grenadier added four Paint and Playsets (#9101-9104) to coincide with Mattel's Masters of the Universe cartoon and 1/285 scale tanks and artillery for Steve Jackson Games' Ogre (#6101, 6110-6115, 6118, 6122) and 1/180 scale vehicles Car Wars Autoduel (#6201-6210) games. In October 1983 Grenadier added a line of Secret Agents (#3001, 3002). As fantasy and science fiction gaming outpaced traditional wargames and modeling, Grenadier discontinued many of their historical period figures. Lines of 54mm scale figures (#5401-5409) featuring personages like \\"5401- Jesus of Nazareth,\\" and a 77mm series of figures (#9001-9003, 9006) based on the calendar art of Boris Vallejo. were dropped in 1983.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.9, Fall 1983, Scott Slingsby, editor. Between March 1984 and February 1985 Grenadier released twelve monthly installments in the popular Dragon-of-the-Month series. Each box set included a variety of fantasy dragon, a jeweled base, and a portion of a map of the mystical land the dragons inhabited. Those who collected all twelve dragons were eligible to receive an additional dragon figure. Other 1984 introductions included the Masterpiece Editions 5501 - War Mammoth of the Undead Legion, 5501 - Death Dragon, futuristic war machines called Warbots (#4501, 4502), and miniatures for Mayfair Games's Champions (#4001, 4002). Grenadier also released four gaming scenarios: The Horrible Secret of Monhegan Island by Gary Pilkington for Call of Cthulhu, Cloudland by Tony Fiorito for Tunnels and Trolls or Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Raid on Rajallapor by Gary Pilkington for Blades' Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes, and Disappearance on Aramat by Gary Pilkington for Game Designers' Workshop's Traveller.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.12, Spring 1984, Scott Slingsby, editor.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.13, Fall 1984, Don Wellman, editor.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.14, January 1985, Don Wellman, editor. Grenadier celebrated its 10th anniversary by adding 10,000 commemorative Paladin figures to boxes of 6007 - Fantasy Lords Dungeon Raiders. The \\"Dragon-of-the-Month\\" products proved very popular and Grenadier released a second series of dragons in March 1985, a line of large humanoids which they called \\"The Giant's Club\\". The first installment was 3501 - Fire Giant, and the \\"Monster Manuscript\\" which included dungeon creatures organized in alphabetical order. Also in 1985 Grenadier released the official miniatures for I.C.E.'s Middle-earth in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings, a line of 15mm soldiers for Game Designers' Workshop's Twilight 2000 skirmish game which takes place in a world where the Cold War was resolved with arms, superheroes for Hero Games' Champions, Pacesetter's Chill, Mayfair Games' D.C. Heroes, and West End Games' Paranoia role-playing games.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 1.15, March 1985, Don Wellman, editorThe Grenadier Bulletin vol. 1.17, Summer 1985, Don Wellman, editor.Grenadier Models Inc. 1987 Photographic Compendium. Grenadier signed on Julie Guthrie in 1987 to sculpt their first signature line Julie Guthrie's Fantasy Personalities.The Grenadier Bulletin, Fall 1987, Don Wellman, editor. By 1988 Grenadier became the manufacturer of miniatures for West End Games' role- playing system, Star Wars. This miniatures series was based upon the first three George Lucas films, and included representations of the main characters, Rebel troops, droids, villains, storm troopers, and vehicles. In 1989 Grenadier released the first Shadowrun miniatures for FASA's role-playing game. =Grenadier Models U.K., 1991-1994= Grenadier models UK Ltd was created in 1984. Bob Watts approached Roger Higgins of Games of Liverpool, Grenadier's British distributor, to cast Grenadier's products for the European market. Higgins recruited his Import and Wholesale Manager, Doug Cowie and Mal Green to set up and run Grenadier Models UK. Casting equipment was set up above their Birkenhead offices and they learned the trade of casting by trial and error. Public grants through the Welsh Development Agency assisted a move to northern Wales. By 1991 Grenadier had begun selling Nick Lund's Fantasy Warriors: a game of fantasy battles a boxed game which included 102 plastic figures sculpted by Mark Copplestone with later additions by other sculptors. Branches of the company were established in Auckland, New Zealand and Deeside, Clwyd, Wales to support British and Australian customers, remove the costs of international shipping, and connect with Grenadier's European sculptors. The company in Wales provided a chance for Grenadier to tap into the growing market for larger scale (30 mm) miniatures in which UK designers invoked styles from European fantasy and science fiction. Grenadier's office in Wales became the center of the company's product design and British artists Mark Copplestone, Bob Naismith, and Nick Lund became the company's chief sculptors.Grenadier Models Inc. 1991 Catalogue The Pennsylvania office provided traditional themes from fantasy and history. Andy Chernak revived his 1978 Western Gunfighters boxed set (#4901) and a line of existing figures entitled Fantasy Classics, Nightmares, and The Best of Julie Guthrie boxed set (#7001). Julie Guthrie introduced the Lords of Light and Decay boxes sets (#8801, 8802), a line of Fantasy Personalities II, and added the Cyberpunk line. Janine Bennett introduced a range of Amazons (#3312) which were suitable for use with Fantasy Warriors.The Grenadier Bulletin, new series #3, Spring 1991, Matt Forbeck editorThe Grenadier Bulletin, new series #4, Summer 1992, Matt Forbeck editor In 1992 Grenadier Models underwent a period of revitalization. The company's founders Andrew Chernak and Ray Rubin returned to their creative responsibilities.Grenadier Models 1993 Catalog, Grenadier Models Inc. Kim Eastland returned to Grenadier Models from TSR, Inc.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 2.1, Summer 1993, Kim Eastland, editor The return to the early structure of the company may have been prompted by the loss of their partnerships with game manufacturers. By the beginning of 1993, their licensed figures had dwindled to the point that they only produced Andrew Chernak and Sandra Garrity's sculptures for R. Talisorian Games' Cyberpunk. The resurgence of the Pennsylvania offices was short-lived, and Nick Lund's Fantasy Warriors (#5000) was the center piece of the 1993 catalog. A similar space-themed game called Future Warriors (#1501-1509, 1701) was released later that same year. Fantasy war gamers were targeted with the Lost Lands boxed sets of 25mm scale miniatures (#3001-3006), Fantasy Warriors artillery pieces and battlefield accessories (#9201-9203, 402-406) and a 15mm Warlords (#1801-1818) line of military units. The fantasy role-playing market was addressed by Julie Guthrie's large signature series (#801-899, 701-724, 7001, 7002, 8101-8145), a Fantasy Legends line (#3101-3128) consisting of existing models and new sculpts by William Watt, Sandra Garrity, and Julie Guthrie. Also in 1993 Grenadier Models released Dragon Lords the Game (#5700-5711) a 6mm scale skirmish game featuring dragon riders, and 25mm plastic space marines called Space Rangers (#87003). Grenadier Models' figures were initially cast in an alloy of lead and tin, but in 1993 New York legislators nearly passed a public health bill barring the use of lead in toys and games.\\"Through the Looking Glass\\" by Robert Bigalow, Dragon #192, April 1993. Despite the additional cost, numerous manufacturers anticipated parental concerns, similar legislation in other states, their own workplace safety, and they began using white metal alloys. Grenadier began converting its lines to a non-lead alloy they called Luminite in the winter of 1992. The use of non-lead alloy marks a clear benchmark for dating old figures. In time, New York Governor Mario Cuomo relented to hobbyists' concerns and exempted miniatures from the state's Public Health Law.\\"Through the Looking Glass\\" by Robert Bigalow, Dragon #205, May 1994. However, Grenadier Models did not return to producing in lead. The product lines for 1994 were a mix of European and American designs. Mark Copplestone and Bob Naismith introduced new sculpts for the Fantasy Warriors game, and Nick Lund and Doug Cowie authored Fantasy Warriors Companion an expansion of the rules. Mike Daley began a series of large scale Master Wizards (#4401, 4402). William Watt added a Battle Giant (#2701) to the Special Edition line, and a signature line of William Watt's Dragons (#2901, 2902). =Post Script= At Gen Con in August 1996 it was revealed that the molds and master sculpts of Grenadier Models Inc. had been purchased by Stratelibri, their long-time distributor in Milan, Italy. The rights have since passed to Mirliton S.G. who continues to produce many of the figures from Grenadier's last years in business. Some of Grenadier's artists retained the right to their work. In 2001 Mega Miniatures purchased the production rights to 180 of the Julie Guthrie's Grenadier Personalities. Those 180 Grenadier Personalities were sold to Center Stage Miniatures in the fall of 2012. The production of all UK designed and sculpted miniatures are currently licensed to em4miniatures of Rustington, West Sussex, England by the holder of those rights. Since the sale of Grenadier Model's assets, Andrew Chernak has taken his sculpting to the other extreme and now creates monumental scale bronzes commemorating fallen soldiers. He is also available for lectures on military history and art.Andrew L.Chernak Sculptures Bronze Statues, http://www.andrewchernak.com/ accessed July 4, 2012 Reception Steve Jackson reviewed assorted scenery from Grenadier Miniatures for Pyramid #8 (July/August 1994), and stated that \\"All in all, these are nice, useful pieces, well cast and finished, quite paintable.

Al-Damiri is, however, better known in the history of literature for his Life of Animals (·∏§ayƒÅt al-·∏•ayawƒÅn al-kubrƒÅ, 1371), which treats in alphabetic order of 931 animals mentioned in the Quran, the traditions and the poetical and proverbial literature of the Arabs. The work is a compilation from over 500 prose writers and nearly 200 poets. The correct spelling of the names of the animals is given with an explanation of their meanings. The use of the animals in medicine, their lawfulness or unlawfulness as food, their position in folklore are the main subjects treated, while occasionally long irrelevant sections on political history are introduced. The work exists in three forms. The fullest has been published several times in Egypt; a mediate and a short recension exist in manuscript. Several editions have been made at various times of extracts, among them the poetical one by al-Suyuti, which was translated into Latin by Abraham Ecchelensis (Paris, 1667). Bochartus in his Hierozoicon (1663) used al-Damiri's work. There is a translation of the whole into English by Lieutenant-Colonel Jayakar (Bombay, 1906‚Äì1908).

On January 18, 2002, Stanley hosted his final telecast as presenter in order to move to ABS-CBN TV-2 Manila as a news reporter and was replaced by Sausa. When TV Patrol Iloilo transferred to Channel 10 in January 2003, it brought in Atty. Jobert Pe√±aflorida as main anchor replacing Sausa. The newscast was, during the first months of the new Channel 10, promoted as TV Patrol Iloilo sa 10 (TV Patrol Iloilo on 10) to remind viewers of the then new channel frequencies in which it had broadcast it and the other national and regional programs produced by ABS-CBN. On 2007, Jennifer Garcia joined as co- anchor of the newscast. On 2010, Pe√±aflorida left the newscast and was replaced by Nony Basco.

Others such as Christian theologians reject this definition and argue that natural evil is the indirect result of original sin just as moral evils are, although moral evil is \\"caused by human activity\\" directly. Some theologians even argue that natural evil is directly perpetrated by demonic agents. Atheists argue that the existence of natural evil challenges belief in the existence, omnibenevolence, or omnipotence of God or any deity.Michael Martin, Atheism: A Philosophical Justification (Temple University Press, 1992), 412. Nature of natural evil Moral evil results from a perpetrator, usually a person that engages in vice, either through intention or negligence. Natural evil has only victims, and is generally taken to be the result of natural processes. The \\"evil\\" thus identified is evil only from the perspective of those affected and who perceive it as an affliction. Examples include cancer, birth defects, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and other phenomena which inflict suffering with apparently no accompanying mitigating good. Such phenomena inflict \\"evil\\" on victims with no perpetrator to blame. In the Bible, God is portrayed as both the ultimate creator and perpetrator, since the ‚Äúsun, moon and stars, celestial activity, clouds, dew, frost, hail, lightning, rain, snow, thunder, and wind are all subject to God's command.‚ÄùBaker's Evangelical Dictionary, s.v. ‚ÄúProvidence of God.‚Äù Examples of natural evils ascribed to God follow: Gustave Dor√©: Dor√©'s English Bible \\"Job Hears of His Misfortunes\\" (Job 1:1‚Äì22) :* Floods: God brought ‚Äúa flood of waters on the earth‚Äù (Genesis 6:17). :* Thunder, hail, lightning: God ‚Äúsent thunder and hail, and fire came down‚Äù (Exodus 9:23). :* Destructive Wind: God sent a ‚Äúgreat wind‚Äù that destroyed Job‚Äôs house and killed his family (Job 1:19). :* Earthquake: By the Lord ‚Äúthe earth will be shaken‚Äù (Isaiah 13:13). :* Drought and Famine: God will shut off rains, so neither land nor trees yield produce (Leviticus 26:19‚Äì20). :* Forest fires: God says, ‚ÄúSay to the southern forest, 'I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree'‚Äù (Ezekiel 20:47). However, some theologians emphasise that, whilst God is the ultimate perpetrator, natural evil is, in actuality, directly perpetrated by Satan and his demons. This is exemplified in how Satan is portrayed as the direct perpetrator of Job's suffering in the Book of Job. Traditional theism (e.g. Thomas Aquinas) distinguishes between God's will and God's permission, claiming that while God permits evil, he does not will it.David Bentley Hart, The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami? (William B. Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 82‚Äì89. This distinction is echoed by some modern open theists, e.g. Gregory A. Boyd, who writes, \\"Divine goodness does not completely control or in any sense will evil.\\"Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: the Bible and Spiritual Conflict (InterVarsity Press,1997) 20. Aquinas partly explained this in terms of primary and secondary causality, whereby God is the primary (or transcendent) cause of the world, but not the secondary (or immanent) cause of everything that occurs in it. Such accounts explain the presence of natural evil through the story of the Fall of man, which affected not only human beings, but nature as well (Genesis 3:16‚Äì19). Especially since the Reformation the distinction between God's will and God's permission, and between primary and secondary causality, has been disputed, notably by John Calvin. Among modern inheritors of this tradition, Mark R. Talbot ascribes evil to God: ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs foreordination is the ultimate reason why everything comes about, including the existence of all evil persons and things and the occurrence of any evil acts or events.‚ÄùMark R. Talbot, ‚ÄúAll the Good That Is Ours in Christ,‚Äù in Suffering and the Sovereignty of God, ed. John Piper and Justin Taylor, 43‚Äì44 (Crossway Books, 2006). Available online at desiringgod.org Such models of God's complete foreordination and direct willing of everything that happens lead to the doctrines of double predestination and limited atonement.David Bentley Hart, The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami? (William B. Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 89‚Äì91. Natural versus moral evil Jean Jacques Rousseau responded to Voltaire's criticism of the optimists by pointing out that the value judgement required in order to declare the 1755 Lisbon earthquake a natural evil ignored the fact that the human endeavour of the construction and organization of the city of Lisbon was also to blame for the horrors recounted as they had contributed to the level of suffering. It was, after all, the collapsing buildings, the fires, and the close human confinement that led to much of the death. The question of whether natural disasters such as hurricanes might be natural or moral evil is complicated by new understandings of the effects, such as global warming, of our collective actions on events that were previously considered to be out of our control. Nonetheless, even before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (which many believe was the beginning point of global warming), natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, flooding, fires, disease, etc.) occurred regularly, and cannot be ascribed to the actions of humans. However, human actions exacerbate the evil effects of natural disasters. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says human activity is a key factor that turns ‚Äúextreme weather events into greater natural disasters.‚Äù For example, ‚Äúdeforestation and floodplain development‚Äù by humans turn high rainfall into ‚Äúdevastating floods and mudslides.\\" When humans damage coastal reefs, remove mangroves, destroy dune systems, or clear coastal forests, \\"extreme coastal events cause much more loss of life and damage.‚Äù Damage by tsunamis varied ‚Äúaccording to the extent of reef protection and remaining mangrove coverage.‚Äù In Europe, human development has ‚Äúcontributed to more frequent and regular floods.‚Äù‚ÄúNatural Disasters Made Worse by Human Activity‚Äù (May 20, 2008), Expatica.com, accessed December 2, 2009. In earthquakes, people often suffer injury or death because of ‚Äúpoorly designed and constructed buildings.‚Äù‚ÄúUN Says Poor Construction to Blame for Earthquake Deaths ‚Äì May 19, 2008,‚Äù Expatica.com, accessed December 2, 2009. In the United States, wildfires that destroy lives and property aren't \\"entirely natural.‚Äù Some fires are caused by human action and the damage inflicted is sometimes magnified by building ‚Äúin remote, fire-prone areas.‚Äù‚ÄúSouthern California Forest Fires,‚Äù time.com, accessed December 2, 2009. Dusty conditions in the West that ‚Äúcan cause significant human health problems‚Äù have been shown to be ‚Äúa direct result of human activity and not part of the natural system.\\"‚ÄúDust in West up 500 Percent in Past 2 Centuries, says CU-Boulder Study,‚Äù eurekalert.org, accessed December 2, 2009. In sum, there is evidence that some \\"natural\\" evil results from human activity and, therefore, contains an element of moral evil. Challenge to religious belief Natural evil (also non-moral or surd evil) is a term generally used in discussions of the problem of evil and theodicy that refers to states of affairs which, considered in themselves, are those that are part of the natural world, and so are independent of the intervention of a human agent. Both natural and moral evil are a challenge to religious believers. Many atheists claim that natural evil is proof that there is no God, at least not an omnipotent, omnibenevolent one, as such a being would not allow such evil to happen to his/her creation. However, the deist position states that intervention by God to prevent such actions (or any intervention) is not an attribute of God.

The species is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The species, which formerly was commonly called simply the \\"tree lizard\\", has been used to study physiological changes during the fight-or-flight response as related to stress and aggressive competition.Jennings DH, Moore MC, Knapp R, Matthews L, Orchinik M (2000). \\"Plasma steroid-binding globulins mediate stress reactivity in the tree lizard, Urosaurus ornatus \\".

General and Comparative Endocrinology 155 (1): 148-156. It has been fairly well studied because it has interesting variation in throat color in males (within a population) that can correlate with different reproductive strategies,Hews DK, Thompson CW, Moore IT, Moore MC (1997). \\"Population frequencies of alternative male phenotypes in tree lizards: geographic variation and common-garden rearing studies\\".

American Zoologist 38: 133-151. Diet The ornate tree lizard feeds on mostly insects and their larvae. Reproduction A group of U. ornatus, consisting of one male and one or more females, typically inhabits an area containing one or more large trees, shrubs, or boulders. The male copulates with each female, and the females retain eggs about two weeks after mating. In many parts of its range, females may lay more than one clutch of eggs a year. Territoriality is an important part of reproduction for many males in this species. Males often defend territories by aggressively excluding other males. This aggression can, in part, be enhanced with higher levels of the steroid hormones testosterone and progesterone.Weiss SL, Moore MC (2004). \\"Activation of aggressive behavior by progesterone and testosterone in male tree lizards, Urosaurus ornatus \\". Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 136 (2): 282‚Äì288. Females have home ranges but do not defend territories. When the number of females on a male's territory is experimentally reduced by removing the females, the male is more likely to abandon his territory.M'Closkey RT, Baia KA, Russell RW (1987). \\"Tree lizard (Urosaurus ornatus) territories: experimental perturbation of the sex ratio\\". Ecology 68 (6): 2059-2062. Females also can vary in throat coloration, although this is not as well-studied. When gravid with eggs, females tend to be orange or red.Zucker N, Boecklen W (1990). \\"Variation in female throat coloration in the tree lizard (Urosaurus ornatus): Relation to reproductive cycle and fecundity\\". Herpetologica 46 (4): 387-394. Recent experiments also suggest females have association, and perhaps mating preferences for different male types, and that this female preference varies with the throat color of the female herself, and with the colors of the two males that she was presented.Lattanzio M, Metro KJ, Miles DB (2014). \\"Preference for male traits differ in two female morphs of the tree lizard, Urosaurus ornatus \\". PLoS ONE 9 (7): e101515. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0101515 Appearance and throat color variation The ornate tree lizard may grow to a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of up to 59 mm (2.3 inches). As adults, all males have paired turquoise patches of skin on the abdomen; females lack this abdominal coloration.Stebbins RC (2003). A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians. (Peterson Field Guides). 3rd Edition. Male ornate tree lizards are found in a variety of colors.Thompson CW, Moore MC (1991). \\"Syntopic occurrence of multiple dewlap color morphs in male tree lizards, Urosaurus ornatus \\". Copeia 1991 (2): 493-503. While not all populations contain more than one or two colors, 9 color types have been documented within U. ornatus. A population documented in Verde River, Arizona, has two types of coloration patterns among male tree lizards that account for 45% of all males. The first is characterized by a blue spot in the center of a larger orange patch on the throat fan (\\"dewlap\\"). The second has a solid orange throat fan (\\"dewlap\\"). The orange-blue males are more aggressive and defend territories that can include up to four females.Thompson CW, Moore MC (1991). \\"Throat colour reliably signals status in male tree lizards, Urosaurus ornatus \\". Animal Behaviour 42 (5): 745-753. The orange males have longer, leaner body types and are much less aggressive. Orange males can be nomadic during dry years, and during rainy years tend to occupy small territories.Knapp R, Hews DK, Thompson CW, Ray LE, Moore MC (2003). \\"Environmental and endocrine correlates of tactic switching by non-territorial male tree lizards, Urosaurus ornatus \\". Hormones and Behavior 43: 83-92. Some, such as Stanford professor and biologist Joan Roughgarden, have suggested multiple male genders in this species. Among differently colored male tree lizards, there are different hormonal profiles. On the day a male tree lizard hatches, researchers think that high blood levels of progesterone and then later, as a juvenile, higher testosterone levels will cause him to develop into an orange-blue type; low progesterone and later lower testosterone levels, as a juvenile, may lead the male to develop into an orange type.Hews DK, Knapp R, Moore MC (1994). \\"Early exposure to androgens affects adult expression of alternative male types in tree lizards\\". Hormones and Behavior 28: 96-115. During dry weather conditions, orange-type males' corticosterone levels increase, which causes testosterone to decrease, leading them to be more likely to leave their territory and become nomadic. Orange-blue males do not have this hormonal response to the weather, and remain in their territories regardless of climatic conditions.

The modern name, meaning \\"the tower of Kavus\\", is a reference to the most imposing ancient monument in the city. The historic name cannot now be restored, as it was oddly and carelessly assigned to the neighboring historical city of Astarabad in the 1930s by the Iranian government. At one point, it was even known as the city of Dashte Gorgan, meaning \\"the Plains of Gorgan\\". It is the capital of Gonbad-e Kavus County, in the province of GolestƒÅn in the northeast of Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 127,167, in 30,710 families. In the historical times, the city's populations were made up of various Iranic peoples such as the ancient and eponymous Hyrcanians, Parthians and eventually the Khurasani Persians. Today, however, there are no reliable figures for the ethnic make of the city. However, it is agreed that the city has a plurality of its inhabitants being ethnic Turkmen, Turkmen who speak a western Turkmen language. The remaining population are made Khorasani Turks, Sistanis, Baluch , Mazandaranis as well as Persians and other smaller Iranic peoples. The city is famous for its historic brick tower of the same name. Iranian footballer Sardar Azmoun is from this city. Linguistic Map of Golestan province Historical attractions The \\"Divar-i Gorgan\\" (Persian for \\"The Great Wall of Gorgan\\") is a gigantic defensive wall built in the Sasanian period of Iranian history. The visible remains are about long and wide. It is one of the most outstanding and gigantic architectural monuments in northeast Iran and the most impressive in the Golestan Province. This wall, which is the largest defensive wall in the world after the Great Wall of China, starts from the Caspian sea coast, circles north of the city of Gonbad-e KƒÅvus, continues towards the northeast, and vanishes into the Pishkamar Mountains. At certain points, the Divar is wide and in other parts the width is , depending on the nature of the land and the soil type. Watch towers and forts had been built at different distances. The longest distance between forts is and the shortest is . The 40 identified forts vary in dimension and shape but the majority are square fortresses. Due to many difficulties in development and agricultural projects, archaeologists have been assigned to mark the boundary of the historical find by laying cement blocks. The Divar defensive wall has also been known variously as Alexander Dam, Anushirv√¢n Dam, Firuz Dam and Golestan's Defense Wall in various historical texts. Dr. Kiani, who led the archaeological team in 1971, believes that the wall was built during the Parthian dynasty, simultaneously with the construction of the Great Wall of China, and that it was restored during the Sassanid era (3rd to 7th centuries AD).

The Arondizuogu community is believed to have migrated from Arochukwu in the present Abia State to their present settlements in across three local governments in Imo state. These include Okigwe, Ideato North and Onuimo Local Governments, although there are others of Aro descent in other local governments in Imo State.  Geographical location  Arondizuogu is a group of sprawling communities with the largest area located in the land obtained from Umualaoma town (formerly Isiokpu). Some believe that this land was obtained through warfare and open massacre of people from Umualaoma. Arondizuogu is in Imo State of Nigeria. Most of the wars were stopped by one powerful charismatic Patriarch of the host community (Isokpu) by the name Ezerioha Udensi of Obiokwara, Obinihu, Umualaoma(Isuokpu). Ezerioha has subsequently organised peaceful allocation or donation of land by different villages and towns close to Arondizuogu after discovering that Arondizuogu people could not go back to Aro Chukwu. Arondizuogu communities are spread out into three local government areas: Ideato North, Okigwe and Onuimo according to the various indigenous villages where the lands were obtained through similar means.  History  Arondizuogu was founded by the use of force by Mazi Izuogu Mgbokpo and his brothers (Iheme) in the mid-14th century. Izuogu Mgbokpo was a charismatic slave merchant who came from Arochukwu to Awka in search of slaves. He was usually harbored by a friend from Umualaoma where he slept when going in search of slaves and with his goods (slaves). Some of the slaves of Izuogu maintained the name even after they were freed from captivity. Izuogu Mgbokpo has three children and three brothers. The children were Uche (Ndi Uche whose mother was from Isiekenesii), Awa (Ndiawa)and Amazu (Ndiamazu). While the brothers were Imoko (Ndi-imoko), Njoku (Ndi-Njoku) and Akame (Ndi-akaeme). Others are aborigines such as Ogbuonyeoma, Amankwu, Ekwuru2 Iheme, himself, was his Chief Servant and he came from Isi-Akpu Nise, in Awka. Iheme and his master Izuogu used all the weapons at their disposal, including the slaves, juju, guns and other equipments for securing slaves which they sold to the European slave merchants, Arondizuogu people refer to themselves as \\"Izuogu na Iheme\\". Early in the 19th century, Mazi Okoli Idozuka was an immigrant from Isi-Akpu Nise to Arondizuogu. As a great slave warrior, he expanded Arondizuogu's boundaries. He later changed his name to Okoro Idozuka, an Aro equivalent of his former name. He was a wealthy ruthless and almost conscienceless slave trader like Izuogu Mgbokpo but was also a great leader. Nwankwo Okoro was the first son of Okoro Idozuka. At the age of 21 he joined his father in the slave trade. * By collecting slaves and war-captives he was able to build a very large family. When the British came, they made him a Warrant Chief because they believed he could subdue anybody and collect the taxes they desperately needed form them. Until this day, Arondizuogu is the biggest former Aro colony and a land of immigrants settling mainly on the rich land. =Historical sites= Some Places of Interest in Arondizuogu include Mazi Mbonu Ojike Cottage (Village home of Nigeria's late \\"Boycott king\\"), Mazi Mbonu Ojike at Ndiakeme Uno; Uno Ogologo (a safe house built in 1887 for hiding children during the slave trade era); The Stone Palace (a storey building cast in stone erected by late Chief Green Mbadiwe, West Africa's first millionaire for his father, Umualaoma Nkwo Ochie (old Nkwo).

It is a day set aside to celebrate achievements, review challenges, and generally keep the flag of patriotism flying in the community. For the culture ‚Äì loving people of Arondizuogu, the day is a special annual homecoming which they celebrate with much aplomb comparable only to their popular Ikeji Festival which is touted to be ‚Äúthe greatest carnival of masks and masquerades in Africa‚Äù. =Ikeji= Ikeji cultural festival of Arondizuogu in Imo State is a popular festival that brings the Igbo speaking community around the world together. Its origin dates back to over five centuries and it is acclaimed as the biggest pan-Igbo cultural community festival with strong heritage, international recognition and is witnessed by thousands of people on a yearly basis. It is arguably the biggest cultural festival in Igboland. In contemporary times, each passing year has witnessed an increase in grandeur, display, dance, sophistication and an all-inclusive participation of all Arondizuogu people and friends. The festival is marked with colourful display of different masquerades such as Ogionu, Mgbadike, Nwaaburuja and Ozoebune; prestigiously parading across the market square to the admiration of the public. The essence of the festival, which ranks among the best surviving traditional ceremonies of the Arondizuogu people, is to celebrate the harvest of the first yams. It serves to unify and foster ties among Aro people who are spread across the entire Igbo speaking states and part of Cross River state. It appeals to the entire Igbo speaking peoples both at home and in the Diaspora. Ikeji is a four-day festival of propitiation, thanksgiving and feasting which is held annually in March or April. Reckoned with the Igbo calendar, these four days correspond to one Igbo week of four market days (Eke, Oye/Orie, Afo and Nkwo). Each of these days has a special significance and represents one of the several dimensions of Ikeji ‚Äì a festival renowned for sumptuous feasting, fascinating masquerades, pulsating rhythms, and colourful performances. Traditional musical instruments used to accompany the masquerades are ekwe (wooden slit drum) of various sizes, ogene (metal gong), bells, maracas and oja (wooden flutes). The flutist is a very important element in the ikeji festival. He deftly communicates with the masquerades - weaving soulful melodies and blending esoteric messages into the intoxicating rhythm of the drums. Another interesting aspect of ikeji is the raconteur known as ima mbem - an imaginative tale delivered with a musical cadence that only the initiated can sometimes understand or comprehend. The importance of the flutist during Ikeji festival is very vital, for he communicates things hidden from the ordinary eyes to the masquerades, combined with soulful melodies, steps and gestures, ‚Äúblending esoteric messages into the intoxicating rhythm of the drums‚Äù to the admiration of the crowd. During Ikeji festival, on the last day, a ram is usually tied to a pole at a popular market square with a single thread. Somebody with the strongest protection from any juju of whatever type is expected to leisurely walk to the ram amids heavy attempt with juju from other people to knock him down, maim him or kill him. Only the brave can participate in, while the not so brave will either abstain from or remain with the crowd as spectators. Only the brave can stand forward from the crowd, one after another and approach the tree with a view to untying the ram. However, each contender will be attacked by forces which are beyond the scope of this article to explain, with a view to stopping him reaching the ram. If overwhelmed, he will beat a retreat back to his starting point. Until eventually, the bravest among the masquerades participating in the competition for that year's festival, after overcoming all odds, will reach the ram and untie it and take it, to a thunderous applause by the spectators. This will be followed by visits to his house by fellow kinsmen with food and wine for elevating the status of his village. Each year this is used to commemorate the person in Arondizuogu and neighbouring towns with the strongest juju or voodoo power of which Pericoma Okoye won several of these contests. Arondizuogu Patriotic Union Arondizuogu Patriotic Union (APU) is the umbrella organisation of all Arondizuogu communities in Nigeria and the Diaspora. Established in 1932 in Aba, APU is one of the earliest and most enduring organs of community development set up by an Igbo clan in colonial Nigeria. The youngmen of Arondizuogu who laid the foundation for APU left their homes for the first time in the 1920s and early 1930s to seek a better life in the emerging urban centres of colonial Nigeria. They found themselves in social, economic and political environments different from the life they knew at home. Refusing to be intimated or alienated, they held on to that deep feeling of love for the community with which they grew up. They assembled at Aba on October 8, 1932, to aggregate ideas on how best to convey the concomitants of modern development with which they were surrounded in the city (such as wide roads, schools, hospitals, post offices, portable water, electricity, court rooms, etc.)to their village community.

London Midland and Scottish Railway Coronation Class No. 6220 (British Railways No. 46220) Coronation was a British steam locomotive.  Overview  6220 was built in 1937 at Crewe Works, the first of its class of streamlined locomotives. It, along with others were given a special livery of Caledonian Railway blue with go-faster stripes instead of the more conventional red. During a press run on 29 June 1937, 6220 set a new speed record on the West Coast Main Line. Driver TJ. Clarke and fireman C. Lewis (with Robert Riddles (engineer) and inspector S. Miller on the footplate), pushed the Stanier pioneer to a claimed speed of 114 miles per hour on Madeley Bank south of Crewe, which broke the previous record of 113 mph set by the rival LNER. Unfortunately jubilation was to become consternation as the footplate team realised the train was still making 110 mph only a mile and a half from Crewe station. Urgent braking improved matters but the locomotive passed through the station's reverse curves at 57 mph, well in excess of the 20 mph limit; the resultant buffeting alarming the passengers and destroying a quantity of crockery in the dining coach. Though the record now lay with the LMS, the scare led to both companies declaring an unofficial truce. This was only broken the following year by the LNER with A4 Class 4468 Mallard, which reached 126 mph whilst trialling a new quick action braking system. In 1939 6220 temporarily swapped identities with 6229 Duchess of Hamilton. The new Coronation was sent on a tour to America for the World's fair. There was thus a blue 6229 Duchess of Hamilton in Great Britain and a red 6220 Coronation in the United States. On the return of the engine from North America, their identities were swapped back again. 6220 swapped its single chimney for a double chimney in December 1944. The streamlining was removed for maintenance reasons in September 1946 and at the same time smoke deflectors were installed. It was painted LMS 1946 black livery in September 1947 followed by BR standard express blue from January 1950 to April 1952. It was painted BR green in April 1952. 46220 remained in semi-streamlined form with sloping smokebox front until February 1957 when a round-topped smokebox was fitted. 46220 was never painted maroon and was in BR green when withdrawn. 46220 was withdrawn in 1963 and cut up at Crewe Works.

It is the successor to CSS algorithm (used for DVD-Video) and was designed for the CPRM/CPPM digital rights management scheme which are used by DRM-restricted Secure Digital cards and DVD-Audio discs.  Cipher details  The C2 symmetric key algorithm is a 10-round Feistel cipher. Like DES, it has a key size of 56 bits and a block size of 64 bits. The encryption and decryption algorithms are available for peer review, but implementations require the so-called \\"secret constant\\", the values of the substitution box (S-box), which are only available under a license from the 4C Entity. The 4C Entity licenses a different set of S-boxes for each application (such as DVD-Audio, DVD-Video and CPRM). (Abstract is in German, rest is in English)  Cryptanalysis  In 2008, an attack was published against a reduced 8-round version of Cryptomeria to discover the S-box in a chosen-key scenario. In a practical experiment, the attack succeeded in recovering parts of the S-box in 15 hours of CPU time, using 2 plaintext-ciphertext pairs. A paper by Julia Borghoff, Lars Knudsen, Gregor Leander and Krystian Matusiewicz in 2009 breaks the full-round cipher in three different scenarios; it presents a 224 time complexity attack to recover the S-box in a chosen-key scenario, a 248 boomerang attack to recover the key with a known S-box using 244 adaptively chosen plaintexts/ciphertexts, and a 253.5 attack when both the key and S-box are unknown.  Distributed brute force cracking effort  Following an announcement by Japanese HDTV broadcasters that they would start broadcasting programs with the copy-once broadcast flag starting with 2004-04-05, a distributed Cryptomeria cipher brute force cracking effort was launched on 2003-12-21. To enforce the broadcast flag, digital video recorders employ CPRM-compatible storage devices, which the project aimed to circumvent. However, the project was ended and declared a failure on 2004-03-08 after searching the entire 56-bit keyspace, failing to turn up a valid key for unknown reasons. Because the attack was based on S-box values from DVD-Audio, it was suggested that CPRM may use different S-boxes. Another brute force attack to recover DVD-Audio CPPM device keys was mounted on 2009-05-06. The attack was intended to find any of 24570 secret device keys by testing MKB file from Queen \\"The Game\\" DVD-Audio disc. On 2009-10-20 such key for column 0 and row 24408 was discovered. The similar brute force attack to recover DVD-VR CPRM device keys was mounted on 2009-10-20. The attack was intended to find any of 3066 secret device keys by testing MKB from Panasonic LM-AF120LE DVD-RAM disc. On 2009-11-27 such key for column 0 and row 2630 was discovered. By now the CPPM/CPRM protection scheme is deemed unreliable.

It was completed in 1962 and rises to 387 feet (118 m) in height. The Grade II listed building, which houses the Co-operative Banking Group, is Manchester's eighth-tallest building and the tallest office building in the United Kingdom outside London. The tower remained as built for over 40 years until maintenance issues on the service tower required an extensive renovation which included covering its facade in photovoltaic panels. Background The mosaic-clad tower in 2002 The tower was designed as a prestige headquarters to showcase the Co-operative movement in Manchester. In 1958, the company proposed building an office tower block, construction began the following year and it was completed in 1962. It was designed by Gordon Tait of Burnett, Tait & Partners and Co-operative's own architect, G. S. Hay. In the 1990s, it was granted Grade II listed building status by English Heritage. The tower, described as \\"the best of the Manchester 1960s office blocks\\", was listed for its \\"discipline and consistency\\". It is part of a group with New Century House and its Conference Hall on Corporation Street. The tower's design was influenced by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill's Inland Steel Building in Chicago after a visit by the architects in 1958. CIS Tower from Miller Street In 1962, at 387 feet, the CIS Tower overtook the Shell Centre as the tallest building in the United Kingdom, a title it retained for a year until it was replaced by the Millbank Tower in London. In 2006, the Beetham Tower became the tallest building in Manchester. Architecture The office tower building rises above a five-storey podium block. It has a steel frame and glass curtain walls with metal window frames. Black vitreous enamel panels demarcate the floor levels. The building materials, glass, enamelled steel and aluminium, were chosen so that the building could remain clean in the polluted Manchester atmosphere. The tower's concrete service shaft, which rises above the office tower, has two bands of vents at the top and was clad in a mosaic made up of 14 million centimetre-square, grey tesserae designed to shimmer and sparkle. The projecting reinforced concrete service shaft houses lifts and emergency stairs. The ground floor is set back behind six pillars. A green bronze-like, abstract mural sculpted by William George Mitchell made from fibreglass covers the entrance hall's rear wall. The building has 700,000 square feet of floor area with clear open spaces on the office floors. Interiors were designed by Misha Black of the Design Research Unit. The executive areas are delineated by the use of teak and cherry wood veneers. Renovation Within six months of construction some of the mosaic tiles on the service tower became detached owing to cement failure and lack of expansion joints in the concrete. Although the tower was granted listed building status in 1995, falling tiles were an ongoing problem. English Heritage had to be consulted as alterations could change the building's appearance. In 2004 CIS consulted Solarcentury with a view to replacing the deteriorating mosaic with 575.5 kW of blue building- integrated photovoltaic (PV) cells which would generate approximately 180,000 kWh (average of 20 kW) of electricity per year. The work was completed by Arup and at that time was the largest commercial solar fa√ßade in Europe. The PV cells made by Sharp Electronics began feeding electricity to the National Grid in November 2005. The project, which cost ¬£5.5 million, was partly funded by the Northwest Regional Development Agency which granted ¬£885,000 and the Energy Savings Trust at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) contributed ¬£175,000. The solar power project was chosen by the DTI as one of the \\"10 best green energy projects\\" of 2005. Out of sight on the roof are 24 wind turbines generating 10% of the tower's electricity.

Points are scored by throwing or kicking the ball into the opposing goal. It is played with two teams of five or more, each with one goalie on a basketball court or soccer field (depending on variant).  History  The game was invented by Elmer D. Mitchell in the early 1920s at the University of Michigan.(Pleban and Wiersma 2003) Elmer was a physical education professor, who sought to develop a game that was not restrictive to the rules of any one sport. He also created the sport to involve more students, especially those who were not as athletic. The sport was popularized and later reformed by players and coaches at Millburn High School in New Jersey. The sport became so popular in the Millburn area that it became an official gym class elective any student could take. Today, it is played in many American high school physical education classes. The sport is still struggling to turn into an actual sport played by club and high school teams. Rules = Objective = The main objective of speedball is the objective of soccer/football. There are two goals, each guarded by the opposite team members or a goalie. Each team attempts to throw the ball into the goal. However, unlike soccer, there are multiple ways goals can be scored. Goals can be scored by kicking the ball into the net or through goal line markers with one's feet or throwing the ball into the goal. \\"Kicks\\" into the soccer goal are worth three points while \\"throws\\" are only worth one and shots made into the basket are two. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins the game. In speedball leagues, whether they are at school or for a local speed ball team, wins are worth three points, ties are worth one point and a loss is worth none. = The field and the ball = The field can be any number of sizes and locations but the earliest variants were generally played on a basketball court or on a soccer field. The size of the goal should be about 6 ft wide by 2.5 ft tall. However, different size and types of goals can be used; the larger the goals, the faster the game generally goes. Hockey goals are also commonly used. A soccer ball, football, rugby ball, or volleyball may be used. = Teams = Speedball can be played on a soccer field but there can only be a max of five on the field at a time, and usually the entire soccer field is not used but rather a small portion of it. The positions are usually as follows: *Goal Keeper (GK) - Guards the goal - tries to block the ball from going inside the goal *Center (C) - Moves with the ball - can play offense or defense *Right Winger (RW) - Plays in the upper right corner of the court/field - crosses the ball in to the center *Left Winger (LW) - Plays in the upper left corner or the court/field - crosses the ball into the center *Defensive Back (DB) Plays defense - tries to gain possession of the ball = Gameplay = The game starts by having a jump ball or coin toss in the center of the court/field, the players are allowed to move anywhere on the court/field of game play. The field players are permitted to touch the ball with any part of their body at any time EXCEPT their arms/hands (see next rule for details). Players may use their arms/hands as long as the last thing the ball touches is not the ground; one may not pick up the ball from the ground. You can pick the ball up if it bounces off the ground in middle school but in adult speedball you can not pick the ball up if it bounces off the ground. A player may use their feet to get the ball in the air to carry it around. If a player does touch the ball with their arms illegally, then it is considered a handball penalty and will result in the ball being turned over to the other team's goalie. If the player has the ball in his/her hands, they must make every effort to stop moving as fast as possible (if one keeps moving it is considered a travel and the ball will be turned over to the other team's goalie). Once a player has a ball in their possession, they can pass it off, attempt to score, or drop the ball in order to utilize other parts of the body to move the ball. Goalies must stay on their side of the court and can't cross the half line (can't cross half court line). Goalies can touch the ball with any part of their body, meaning that they can pick up the ball off the ground without it being considered an \\"illegal\\" move. It is still illegal for goalies to travel with the ball in their hands; however, they can dribble the ball. = Penalties and Fouls= A penalty is when a foul is committed inside the goal box and the other team gets to take a penalty kick. A foul, committed anywhere except in the box, results in a free kick for the player fouled. If the ball goes outside and is no longer in bounds the last player to touch it must give the ball to the other team. The team receiving the ball can throw it in like a throw-in for basketball. Unlike soccer, there are no yellow cards in Speedball. A player, who commits an unnecessary foul receives a red card. Unlike soccer, a single red card does not mean the player is kicked from the game. The player receiving the card must sit in a penalty box and must stay out for at least five minutes. Three red cards for a single player means a player is kicked from the match. *Handball -- if a player touches the ball with his/her hands after it touches the ground *Traveling -- when a player takes steps after coming to a complete stop while the ball is in the player's hands *Unsportsmanlike Conduct ‚Äî viciously assaulting another player with no intention of going after the ball *Goalies Passing The Half Line ‚Äî when a goalie moves over the half line  References  *Lisa A.

In 1917, he was a leader of the Left Socialist- Revolutionaries, supporting the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution. He was the uncle of Alexander Berkman. Biography =Early years= Mark Natanson was born in 1850 in ≈†venƒçionys, Lithuania to a Lithuanian Jewish family. His parents died while he was still young, so he was brought up by his uncle. He graduated from the Kaunas men's grammar school in 1868, studied in St Petersburg at the Medical and Surgical Academy (1868‚Äì71) and then at the Institute of Agriculture (1871). During this time, he became involved in radical student politics. =The populist movement= Together with his first wife, he was one of the organizers of the populist Circle of Tchaikovsky. They opposed the 'nihilistic' tendency of Sergei Nechaev, who believed that any means were acceptable for achieving revolutionary goals. The Circle of Tchaikovsky, on the contrary, preached high morality and self-improvement . In 1869-71 he was arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress, and in 1872 he was exiled to the Arkhangelsk province. In the same 1872 he converted to Orthodoxy in order to formally marry the noblewoman Olga Alexandrovna Shleisner who followed him into exile . In 1876, Natanson returned to Petrograd. He organized the escape abroad of Peter Kropotkin, a comrade from the Circle of Tchaikovsky. In the same year, he began work on the unification of the Narodnik circles into a single revolutionary organization, which in 1878 was called \\"Land and Liberty.\\" In December 1876, together with Georgi Plekhanov, he organized a demonstration in Kazan square. In 1877, he was once again arrested and, after serving his term in the Peter and Paul Fortress, he was exiled to Eastern Siberia.Mandred Hildermeier, The Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party Before the First World War. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000; pg. 382. Upon returning from exile in 1889, he settled in Saratov, where he got a job on the local railway. After 'Land and Liberty' split, he once again began work on the unification of disparate revolutionary circles. He set himself the goal of uniting the populist, social democratic and liberal movements in the Russian liberation movement. In September 1893, at the constituent congress in Saratov, a single party, 'The People's Will' (Narodnaya Volya), was created. The organization's headquarters were in Oryol and they ran a printing house in Smolensk, which printed the group's manifesto and revolutionary brochures. Narodnaya Volya favoured agitation among urban workers and intellectuals, rather than spreading propaganda among the peasants (a tactic adopted by the other offshoot of 'Land and Liberty', the 'Black Repartition' group). Narodnaya Volya also endorsed political terrorism as a tactic and in 1881, they assassinated Tsar Alexander II. Natanson was not directly involved in any terrorist act. In April 1894, Narodnaya Volya was liquidated by the police administrator Sergei Zubatov, and its leaders were arrested. In exile in Yakutsk, he married Varvara Alexandrova. When a shipyard was organized for the construction of a ferry crossing on Lake Baikal, the Corps of Ship Engineers needed an experienced and honest accountant, and Natanson took the job. His merits in organizing the construction are confirmed by the fact that on June 17, 1899, at the gala dinner in honor of the launch of the icebreaker \\"Baikal\\", there was a toast pronounced in honor of the political exile. =People's Rights Party= After his release he returned to European Russia and became active in Saratov, where in 1893 he founded the party People's Rights Party (Partiia Narodnogo Prava). Historian Shmuel Galai has argued that \\"for the first time in the annals of Russian parties, it declared organized public opinion to be the main weapon in the struggle against autocracy,\\" in contradistinction to peasant revolt, general strike, or terror.Shmuel Galai, The Liberation Movement in Russia, 1900-1905. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973; pg. 64. However, the People's Rights Party proved to be a short-lived venture, as in 1894, Natanson was arrested again and banished to eastern Siberia for ten years. Natanson remained an active revolutionary even in Siberian exile, maintaining the party treasury and coordinating various organisational tasks. Upon returning from exile, he lived in Baku, where he worked as an accountant in the city government. In 1904 he emigrated to Switzerland, where he met with Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov. By this time, the Russian liberation movement had finally divided into social-democratic, liberal and populist movements. In 1902, the followers of the Narodniks united into the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. After some hesitation, Nathanson joined the Socialist Revolutionaries and became one of their leaders. The successful assassination of the Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve, Natanson began to support the terrorist tactics of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The tactical position adopted by the SRs represented a compromise between the rural agitation favoured by South Russian and Ukrainian populists, the factory organisation favoured by the People's Rights Party and the terrorist tactics embraced by the remnants of 'The People's Will' and some of the revolutionary groups of Moscow and Petrograd. In September 1904, together with Viktor Chernov and Yevno Azef, he negotiated with Plekhanov, Ulyanov and other social democrats in order to convince them to take part in the common cause. During the 1905 Russian Revolution, Natanson moved in Finland. At the first congress of the Socialist- Revolutionary Party in early 1906, he was elected a member of the Party Central Committee. After the revolution was put down, he returned to exile in Switzerland. Natanson still held a reserved position in relation to the party‚Äôs terrorist tactics. In 1906, he was an opponent of the assassination of George Gapon, the decision on which was made without his consent . At his insistence, the party refused to take responsibility for this murder . In 1907, he opposed the plan for the murder of Nicholas II, developed by Azef and Grigory Gershuni . However, in 1908, when Vladimir Burtsev began a campaign to expose Azef as an agent provocateur, Nathanson defended Azef. Until the very end, he refused to believe in Azef‚Äôs cooperation with the secret police. In his memoirs, Burtsev wrote that Natanson was the most evil of his opponents . =Years of exile= When the First World War broke out in 1914, the SRs, like most other European socialist parties, split into those who supported a war of 'national defence' ('Defencists') and those who opposed the war ('Internationalists'). Natanson sided with the 'Internationalists' and attended the international socialist peace conferences such as the Zimmerwald Conference and one at Kienthal in Switzerland, signing the conference's manifestoes on behalf of the SR Internationalists. Natanson returned to Russia in 1917 where he was active in the administration of the SRs. =Founder of the Left SRs= After the February Revolution broke out, Natanson returned to Russia through German territory ‚Äúin a sealed wagon‚Äù . He became one of the most prominent leaders of the left wing of the SRs, which became increasingly disenchanted with the Provisional Government and with Alexander Kerensky and sharply criticized the defensive position of the of the SR central committee. Natanson advocated the ‚Äúdeepening‚Äù of the revolution - the transfer of all land to peasants, and power to the Soviets. Natanson and the \\"Left SRs\\" supported the October Revolution, causing a split in the Socialist Revolutionary Party. In November 1917, he initiated the creation of the party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. At the first Left SR congress, he was elected to the Presidium, and then to the Central Committee of the new party. The Left SRs rejected the Brest-Litovsk Treaty (later superseded by the Versailles treaty), which imposed onerous terms on Russia in exchange for a separate peace with Russia. The Left SRs exited the Soviet government in protest, and some took up arms against the Bolsheviks. Natanson opposed this course, fearing that a defeat of the Soviet government would spell the end of the revolution and usher in a counter-revolution. He founded the Party of Revolutionary Communism, which supported the Bolsheviks and eventually merged with the Communist Party of the USSR. Natanson was a member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. However, Natanson's opposition to the anti-Bolshevik uprising of the Left SRs did not imply whole-hearted acceptance of the Bolsheviks' policies. In particular, he objected to Lenin's decision to ban all other political parties in the Soviet Union.

It was built to stave off possible catastrophic flooding should the upstream Imnam Dam in North Korea collapse, either intentionally or by accident. The dam was completed in 2005. As it stands, the dam has no reservoir, and is merely preventive. Daelim Industrial Co,.Ltd, leading contractor for the Peace Dam construction project, began the construction in 2012 and will end the project in 2014. And the design company for the project is Isan. Construction began in 1987, in reaction to a perceived threat following the construction of the Imnam Dam by North Korea. The Bukhan River is a tributary of the Han River, and catastrophic scenarios foresaw a flood engulfing the South Korean capital of Seoul in case of an attack by North Korea. Construction was halted before completion, amidst allegations that the threat had been grossly exaggerated. Construction resumed after satellite photographs in 2002 revealed the existence of cracks in the Imnam Dam, triggering fears that it could collapse in case of heavy rains. In September 2005, North Korea released massive quantities of water without warning, causing serious flooding just south of the border. The Peace Dam is 601 meters wide, 125 meters tall, and capable of holding 2.61 billion tons of water. Its construction cost $429 million.

The team was founded in 2006 and sponsored by Texas Instruments DLP division. In 2007 with drivers Tony Raines and Ron Fellows (for the road courses) behind the wheel of the No. 96 DLP Chevrolet, the team would finish 25th in owners points. The team has sold to Jeff Moorad and Tom Garfinkle after the 2007 season and eventually closed after the 2009 season. History = Car No. 96 history = The 96 car at Pocono in 2007. ;Terry Labonte and Tony Raines (2006) Hall of Fame Racing was first rumored in 2003, but it took three years to start competing. The team announced at Texas Motor Speedway on November 3, 2005, that for the 2006 season, the team would be operating only one car, the No. 96 sponsored by Texas Instruments' Digital Light Processing technology. Terry Labonte drove the car for the first five races, placing it inside the top 35 in the point standings, and guaranteeing a starting spot in upcoming races. Labonte also drove the car at the two road courses, with Tony Raines racing at the others. Raines and the team had a solid night during the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, taking the lead for 28 laps and finishing in 7th place. The team's highest finish in 2006 was third at Infineon Raceway with Labonte at the wheel, and finished 26th in owners points. ;Tony Raines (2007) Raines was to compete in 2007 on a full-time basis, however those plans changed after the year began, when it was announced that road course driver Ron Fellows would take the wheel at the road courses at Infineon Raceway and Watkins Glen. Fellows went on to finish 15th at Infineon and 4th at the Glen, and Raines' best finish was 9th at the UAW-Ford 500. Raines was able to earn the team 25th in the final owners' points standings, however, the highest finish for any single car team in the Sprint Cup Series since 2005 with the Wood Brothers and Ricky Rudd, and also improving upon HOF's 26th-place finish the year before. Raines ended 2007 with 18 top 25 finishes. ;J.J. Yeley (2008) For 2008, the team decided to hire J. J. Yeley from Joe Gibbs Racing. The contract was to last throughout 2010, and it was announced that they would be switching to Toyota. With Yeley at the wheel, the team quickly fell out of the top 35 in points and, by the end of the year, failed to qualify for five races. In August 2008, Hall of Fame Racing released Yeley, replacing him with Brad Coleman for one race, and later Ken Schrader and Joey Logano. P. J. Jones also ran a one-off race for HOF Racing at Watkins Glen, finishing 37th. The team's highest finish in 2008 was 3rd at New Hampshire with Yeley in a rained shorted race, but finished better than 25th only 5 times out of 36 attempts, and ended the year 39th in the Nextel Cup Series owners standings (out of 43 full-time teams). It was also announced in September 2008 that Troy Aikman, Roger Staubach, Bill Saunders and Mark Griege were no longer part of the ownership group, leaving only Moorad, Garfunkel, and Whitman as the owners. Brad Coleman had signed a development contract with Hall of Fame and was expected to drive the car in 2009, but he was reported to be released at the end of the year and replaced by Bobby Labonte after running only one race for the team in 2008. ;Bobby Labonte (2009) On January 13, 2009, Hall of Fame Racing announced an alignment with Yates Racing. Technically, Hall of Fame Racing closed its doors, laying off all of its employees, and brought over sponsorship to the former No. 38 car, changing the number to No. 96. Bobby Labonte was to be the full-time driver with sponsorship from search engine Ask.com, who provided primary sponsorship for 18 races, Academy Sports and Outdoors for 5 races, and Texas Instruments/DLP for 8 races. However, in August due to sponsorship problems, Labonte was replaced by Roush Fenway Racing Nationwide Series driver Erik Darnell, for 7 of the last 12 races. Darnell came over with sponsorship from Northern Tool and Equipment and Labonte replaced David Gilliland in the 71 TRG Motorsports car. The team ended the season 31st in owners points, with only 1 top-5 finish. Following the 2009 season, Yates Racing merged with Richard Petty Motorsports and Front Row Motorsports, and the No. 96 team was shut down. The car owner points were transferred to Front Row for the 2010 season.

Urban's style and voice have been described as similar to Ronnie James Dio (Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Dio), Jon Oliva (Savatage, Jon Oliva's Pain), Zak Stevens (Savatage, Circle II Circle), and Mike Howe (Metal Church). Career Urban's current bands are Serious Black, and Project Arcadia. His first official release was with Tad Morose. Tad Morose Urban joined Tad Morose in 1996, replacing singer Kristian 'Krille' Andr√©n. He appeared on the albums A Mended Rhyme (1997), Undead (2000), Matters of the Dark (2002) and Modus Vivendi (2003). He left Tad Morose in December 2005. Bloodbound He sang on Bloodbound's 2005 debut, Nosferatu, and later co-wrote and performed on their third studio album, Tabula Rasa. Although he announced in 2006 that he was no longer working with Bloodbound, who hired another singer, Michael Bormann, to record vocals on their second album, he later agreed to, and did, perform with them at Sweden Rock Festival in June 2007. The band announced in October 2007 that he had rejoined as an official member. However, in 2010, Breed announced on his forum that Bloodbound had decided to continue with another singer, thus ending his second tenure with the band. Trail of Murder In October 2007, Urban announced his new full-time project, Trail of Murder, with Pelle √Ökerlind (Morgana Lefay, Bloodbound) and Daniel Olsson (ex-Tad Morose). Trail Of Murder signed a deal with Metal Heaven, and their debut album Shades Of Art was released in Europe on October 26, 2012. A brief tour followed in the spring of 2013. The album has received numerous, overwhelmingly positive reviews.http://www.urbanbreed.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1148 Urban left Trail of Murder in 2015 to focus on his other bands. Project Arcadia In the summer of 2012 Urban joined Project Arcadia and shortly after began recording vocals for their second album, A Time Of Changes. He performed live with Project Arcadia in October 2012 in support of metal giants Accept. \\"A Time Of Changes\\" was released on 9 September 2014 in North America, 29 September 2014 in the rest of the world through Nightmare Records. Their first video, for \\"Formidable Foe\\" was released on August 6, 2014. The album was highly acclaimed by fans and by critics in various reviews.http://www.urbanbreed.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1227 Serious Black On July 18, 2014, a new \\"supergroup\\" of sorts was announced: Serious Black.https://www.facebook.com/seriousblackofficial Including Roland Grapow (Masterplan) and Thomen Stauch (Blind Guardian, Savage Circus), as well as Dominik Sebastian (Edenbridge), Mario Lochert (Visions of Atlantis), and Jan Vacik (Dreamscape), the band released their debut album As Daylight Breaks in early 2015. They first toured as the supporting act for Hammerfall on their European tour in January and February 2015. Despite a couple of personnel changes over the ensuing year and a half, Serious Black released their second album Mirrorworld in September 2016, with Bob Katsionis (Firewind) and Alex Holzworth (Rhapsody) replacing Grapow and Stauch, respectively. They made their U.S. live debut at ProgPower XVII in Atlanta on September 10. Their first headlining tour took place shortly thereafter, in Europe. In April 2017, via their Facebook page, the band announced that their third studio album, Magic, would be released in August 2017. They also announced dates for their supporting headlining tour in Fall 2017. Other projects/bands On July 11, 2008, it was announced that Urban had become the new singer of Danish progressive/power metal band Pyramaze. He replaced previous vocalist Matt Barlow, who left to re-join Iced Earth. However, the work with Pyramaze was put on hold, and ultimately Urban never recorded with them. On June 18, 2010, Breed announced he would be singing on a new Dark Empire album.http://forum.urbanbreed.com/showthread.php?t=1001 On October 15, 2010, Breed announced that due to what can best be termed creative differences, he would not be recording with Dark Empire after all. Breed has also contributed backing vocals on fellow Swedes Wolverine's 2003 album Cold Light of Monday and 2008's Memory Garden album, Carnage Carnival, and guest vocals on the song \\"Silence the Wolves,\\" from Neverland's 2010 album Ophidia.

It set out to be deliberately anarchic, reminiscent of Viz but for children. The creators also cited Mad magazine as a major influence. Part of its difference in the marketplace was that it attracted writers and cartoonists from a wide range of previous disciplines. It was devised, launched and edited by Patrick Gallagher, Private Eye regular contributor Tony Husband and Mark Rodgers, although within the fiction of the comic it was \\"edited\\" by a character called Uncle Pigg (similar to 2000 AD's Tharg the Mighty). The comic also followed 2000 AD's lead in crediting its contributors for their work, still a rarity in British comics at that time. Featured artists and writers included Husband's Private Eye colleague David Haldane, ex-The Fall member and future BBC Radio 1 radio host Marc \\"Lard\\" Riley, Malcolm Douglas, Brickman creator Lew Stringer, future Beano writer/artist Kev F Sutherland, future Marvel artist, writer and editor & current SpongeBob SquarePants Magazine editor David Leach, future Financial Times cartoonist Jeremy Banks, and satirical media commentator-to-be Charlie Brooker. Viz founders Davy Thorp and Chris Donald also contributed some one- off strips, as did The Beano's Tom Paterson and John Geering. Oink! proved somewhat controversial, with various conservative groups and a chain of newsagents branding it offensive and unsuitable for children. A notably controversial item was the story \\"Janice and John and the Parachute Jump\\", a parody of the Janet and John readers which appeared in issue 7, which prompted an official complaint to the Press Council. The Council ruled in Oink's favour (and the strip was subsequently reprinted in the comic alongside an editorial about the affair) but the negative publicity resulted in some newsagents, including WHSmith, placing it on the top shelves away from other comics, thus damaging its sales potential to its young target audience. An item on how the poll tax meant people owning parrots had to pay tax unless they were members of the Conservative Party was read out in the House of Commons.Hansard, 20 July 1988 Originally a fortnightly publication, it became weekly and finally monthly and was finally wound up in November 1988 after 68 issues, though both a summer and winter special were published in 1989, and a final summer special (consisting almost entirely of reprinted material) in 1990. The comic's founders, Patrick Gallagher, Tony Husband and Mark Rodgers, were offered a TV deal which resulted in the show Round the Bend. Three Oink! strips transferred to Buster: \\"Weedy Willy\\", \\"Pete and his Pimple\\" and \\"Tom Thug\\", the latter appearing through to the comic's last issue in 1999. In 1987 Oink! was made into a computer game of the same name.http://mrparsons.webspace.virginmedia.com/html/commodore_64_-_oink__page.html Mark Rodgers' archives relating to Oink! are held by Archive Services, University of Dundee. Notable strips Some of the most popular recurring characters in the comic were: * Uncle Pigg, whose staff were known as the Plops (apparently, sentient mounds of faeces) and who had an ongoing battle with conservative critic Mary Lighthouse (an obvious parody of Mary Whitehouse) (usually written by Mark Rodgers, artwork by Ian Jackson) * The Street-Hogs (writer Mark Rodgers, artwork Malcolm Douglas as J.T. Dogg), anthropomorphic crime-fighting biker pigs. * Harry the Head (he was only a head) (Marc Riley) * Billy's Brain (he was only a brain) (David Haldane) * Horace \\"Ugly Face\\" Watkins (Tony Husband) * Weedy Willy (artwork Mike Green, sometimes written by Mark Rodgers, Vaughan Brunt or others) * Pete and his Pimple (the Pimple was on Pete's nose and was bigger than he was) (Lew Stringer) * The Secret Diary of Hadrian Vile (an obvious parody of Adrian Mole) (writer Mark Rodgers, artwork Ian Jackson) * Tom Thug (who spent most of the first six months of publication attempting to tie his shoelaces) (Lew Stringer) * Mr Bignose (Jeremy Banks) * Burp The Smelly Alien (who could talk to his internal organs, many of which could talk back) (Jeremy Banks) * Rubbish Man (an inept superhero) (David Haldane) * Hugo the Hungry Hippo (David Haldane) * Cowpat County (Davy Francis) * Frank Sidebottom (Chris Sievey) * Psycho Gran (David Leach) Satirist Charlie Brooker, who was still at school at the time, contributed various strips, none of which were true \\"regulars\\" individually, but which recurred in loose rotation. These included \\"Freddie Flop (He Falls to Pieces)\\", \\"Disgusting Des\\", \\"Clint Gritwood, The Trigger-Happy Cop\\", \\"The Adventures of Death\\" and \\"Transmogrifying Tracey (She Can Change Into Anything She Likes!)\\". Aside from straightforward comic strips, the comic would also include spoof news items, adverts (usually for the fictional GBH brand) and so forth. The comic also featured many parodies of films, TV shows, and strips from other comics. There were also regular photo stories, with photography by James Gallagher, often starring Snatcher Sam, who was 'played' by Marc Riley. As the title suggested, pigs were a constant theme. Celebrities would regularly be caricatured as pigs, complete with punning names (Peter Swillton, Michael Jaxham, Janice Pong, etc.) and even existing comic strips would be parodied with a pig theme (e.g. \\"Ham Dare, Pig of the Future!\\"). Russell Grant and his horoscopes were also parodied as \\"Russell Grunt's Hogoscopes\\". Besides Mary Lighthouse, Uncle Pigg's biggest enemies were butchers, the most vicious of whom was Jimmy \\"The Cleaver\\" Smith. For most of the comic's run, each issue had a theme (e.g., Christmas, holidays, family etc.) which often allowed the comic to experiment. One issue (dubbed \\"Oink! goes Peculiar\\") showed everything going wrong in the Oink! offices, leading to strips being printed upside down or being drawn by the wrong artist etc. In another issue, Uncle Pigg and the Plops all went on holiday, leaving a skeleton staff (of literal skeletons) to produce the comic. The themes were dropped when the comic went weekly at the beginning of 1988. Some items aimed slightly over their target audience's heads - in one strip, Weedy Willy wandered around moaning whilst being followed by a shadowy stranger who was writing down everything he said - for example, \\"Oh, I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear,\\" and \\"Heaven knows, I'm miserable now.\\" At the end of the strip, the figure was revealed as Steven Morrissey, getting ideas. The first issue came with a free flexi-disk single called \\"Poo Poo Tinkle Tinkle Parp Parp Oink Tiddly Widdly Widdly Widdly Plop.\\" References  External links  * Oink! at Comicgrapevine * The Oink!

Cimolestans had a wide variety of body shapes, dentition and lifestyles, though the majority of them were small to medium-sized general mammals that bore superficial resemblances to rodents, weasels or opossums. Several groups have previously been suggested to have descended from the Cimolesta: the Pholidota (which would have been regarded as a suborder of Cimolesta), the Creodonta, and the Carnivora. The origins of the enigmatic Dinocerata have been suggested to lie within the Cimolesta as well. However, recent studies have revealed that cimolestans are more likely to be basal, non-placental eutherians, with no living descendants. Some experts had placed the pangolins within Cimolesta, though the current consensus is that the pangolins should be placed within their own order, Pholidota, as a sister taxon to Carnivora within Ferae. Some have also placed the enigmatic family Ptolemaiidae within Cimolesta, also due to similarities between dental and skull anatomies with those of Pantolesta. If the ptolemaiids were indeed cimolestids, then Cimolesta would have ranged from the Late Cretaceous to the early Miocene, when the last ptolemaiid, Kelba, disappeared in Eastern Africa. However, more thorough studies suggest that the ptolemaiids were more probably afrotheres related to aardvarks, tenrecs and golden moles. If one ignores the ptolemaiids as afrotherians, then the last, unequivocal cimolestids, the pantolestids Gobiopithecus and Kiinkerishella, died out during the Late Eocene or early Oligocene. The cimolestid, Procerberus, may have been closely related to Taeniodonta.Clemens, W. A. (2017).

Procerberus was the largest cimolestid and different species may be closer to conoryctid taeniodonts and others to stylinodontine taeniodonts. However, Procerberus has been found by cladistic analysis to be outside of a Taeniodonta + Alveugena carbonensis, with Procerberus grandis being closer to that clade than to other Procerberus species.

The technique is now commonly applied to problems in physics, but has its origins in attempts to give precise meanings to ill-conditioned sums appearing in number theory. Definition There are several different summation methods called zeta function regularization for defining the sum of a possibly divergent series One method is to define its zeta regularized sum to be Œ∂A(‚àí1) if this is defined, where the zeta function is defined for large Re(s) by : \\\\zeta_A(s) = \\\\frac{1}{a_1^s}+\\\\frac{1}{a_2^s} +\\\\cdots if this sum converges, and by analytic continuation elsewhere. In the case when an = n, the zeta function is the ordinary Riemann zeta function. This method was used by Euler to \\"sum\\" the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... to Œ∂(‚àí1) = ‚àí1/12. showed that in flat space, in which the eigenvalues of Laplacians are known, the zeta function corresponding to the partition function can be computed explicitly. Consider a scalar field œÜ contained in a large box of volume V in flat spacetime at the temperature T = Œ≤‚àí1. The partition function is defined by a path integral over all fields œÜ on the Euclidean space obtained by putting œÑ = it which are zero on the walls of the box and which are periodic in œÑ with period Œ≤. In this situation from the partition function he computes energy, entropy and pressure of the radiation of the field œÜ. In case of flat spaces the eigenvalues appearing in the physical quantities are generally known, while in case of curved space they are not known: in this case asymptotic methods are needed. Another method defines the possibly divergent infinite product a1a2.... to be exp(‚àíŒ∂‚Ä≤A(0)). used this to define the determinant of a positive self-adjoint operator A (the Laplacian of a Riemannian manifold in their application) with eigenvalues a1, a2, ...., and in this case the zeta function is formally the trace of A‚àís. showed that if A is the Laplacian of a compact Riemannian manifold then the Minakshisundaram‚ÄìPleijel zeta function converges and has an analytic continuation as a meromorphic function to all complex numbers, and extended this to elliptic pseudo-differential operators A on compact Riemannian manifolds. So for such operators one can define the determinant using zeta function regularization. See \\"analytic torsion.\\" suggested using this idea to evaluate path integrals in curved spacetimes. He studied zeta function regularization in order to calculate the partition functions for thermal graviton and matter's quanta in curved background such as on the horizon of black holes and on de Sitter background using the relation by the inverse Mellin transformation to the trace of the kernel of heat equations. Example The first example in which zeta function regularization is available appears in the Casimir effect, which is in a flat space with the bulk contributions of the quantum field in three space dimensions. In this case we must calculate the value of Riemann zeta function at -3, which diverges explicitly. However, it can be analytically continued to s=-3 where hopefully there is no pole, thus giving a finite value to the expression. A detailed example of this regularization at work is given in the article on the detail example of the Casimir effect, where the resulting sum is very explicitly the Riemann zeta-function (and where the seemingly legerdemain analytic continuation removes an additive infinity, leaving a physically significant finite number). An example of zeta-function regularization is the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the energy of a particle field in quantum field theory. More generally, the zeta-function approach can be used to regularize the whole energy-momentum tensor in curved spacetime. The unregulated value of the energy is given by a summation over the zero-point energy of all of the excitation modes of the vacuum: :\\\\langle 0T_{00} 0\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_n \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_n}{2} Here, T_{00} is the zeroth component of the energy-momentum tensor and the sum (which may be an integral) is understood to extend over all (positive and negative) energy modes \\\\omega_n; the absolute value reminding us that the energy is taken to be positive. This sum, as written, is usually infinite (\\\\omega_n is typically linear in n). The sum may be regularized by writing it as :\\\\langle 0T_{00}(s) 0\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_n \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_n}{2} \\\\omega_n^{-s} where s is some parameter, taken to be a complex number. For large, real s greater than 4 (for three-dimensional space), the sum is manifestly finite, and thus may often be evaluated theoretically. The zeta-regularization is useful as it can often be used in a way such that the various symmetries of the physical system are preserved. Zeta-function regularization is used in conformal field theory, renormalization and in fixing the critical spacetime dimension of string theory. Relation to other regularizations We can ask if there are any relations to the dimensional regularization originated by the Feynman diagram. But now we may say they are equivalent to each other, see. However the main advantage of the zeta regularization is that it can be used whenever the dimensional regularization fails, for example if there are matrices or tensors inside the calculations \\\\epsilon _{i,j,k} Relation to Dirichlet series Zeta-function regularization gives an analytic structure to any sums over an arithmetic function f(n). Such sums are known as Dirichlet series. The regularized form :\\\\tilde{f}(s) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f(n)n^{-s} converts divergences of the sum into simple poles on the complex s-plane. In numerical calculations, the zeta-function regularization is inappropriate, as it is extremely slow to converge. For numerical purposes, a more rapidly converging sum is the exponential regularization, given by :F(t)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f(n) e^{-tn}. This is sometimes called the Z-transform of f, where z = exp(‚àít). The analytic structure of the exponential and zeta-regularizations are related. By expanding the exponential sum as a Laurent series :F(t)=\\\\frac{a_N}{t^N} + \\\\frac{a_{N-1}}{t^{N-1}} + \\\\cdots one finds that the zeta-series has the structure :\\\\tilde{f}(s) = \\\\frac{a_N}{s-N} + \\\\cdots. The structure of the exponential and zeta-regulators are related by means of the Mellin transform. The one may be converted to the other by making use of the integral representation of the Gamma function: :\\\\Gamma(s+1)=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty x^s e^{-x} \\\\, dx which lead to the identity :\\\\Gamma(s+1) \\\\tilde{f}(s+1) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty t^s F(t) \\\\, dt relating the exponential and zeta-regulators, and converting poles in the s-plane to divergent terms in the Laurent series. Heat kernel regularization The sum :f(s)=\\\\sum_n a_n e^{-s\\\\omega_n} is sometimes called a heat kernel or a heat-kernel regularized sum; this name stems from the idea that the \\\\omega_n can sometimes be understood as eigenvalues of the heat kernel. In mathematics, such a sum is known as a generalized Dirichlet series; its use for averaging is known as an Abelian mean. It is closely related to the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform, in that :f(s)=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} \\\\, d\\\\alpha(t) where \\\\alpha(t) is a step function, with steps of a_n at t=\\\\omega_n. A number of theorems for the convergence of such a series exist. For example, by the Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem, if :L=\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\log\\\\vert\\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\\\\vert}{\\\\omega_n} then the series for f(s) converges in the half-plane \\\\Re(s)>L and is uniformly convergent on every compact subset of the half-plane \\\\Re(s)>L. In almost all applications to physics, one has L=0 History Much of the early work establishing the convergence and equivalence of series regularized with the heat kernel and zeta function regularization methods was done by G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood in 1916 and is based on the application of the Cahen‚ÄìMellin integral. The effort was made in order to obtain values for various ill-defined, conditionally convergent sums appearing in number theory. In terms of application as the regulator in physical problems, before , J. Stuart Dowker and Raymond Critchley in 1976 proposed a zeta-function regularization method for quantum physical problems. Emilio Elizalde and others have also proposed a method based on the zeta regularization for the integrals \\\\int_{a}^{\\\\infty}x^{m-s}dx , here x^{-s} is a regulator and the divergent integral depends on the numbers \\\\zeta (s-m) in the limit s \\\\to 0 see renormalization. Also unlike other regularizations such as dimensional regularization and analytic regularization, zeta regularization has no counterterms and gives only finite results.

The Musqueam Indian Band ( ) is a First Nations band government in the Canadian province of British Columbia and is the only First Nations band whose reserve community lies within the boundaries of the City of Vancouver.  Name  The name Musqueam relates back to the flowering plant, m…ôŒ∏k ∑…ôyÃì, which grows in the Fraser River estuary. There is a sœá ∑…ôyÃìemÃì that has been passed on from generation to generation that explains how they became known as the x ∑m…ôŒ∏k ∑…ôyÃì…ôm ‚Äì People of the m…ôŒ∏k ∑…ôyÃì plant.

The Great Marpole Midden (also known as the Eburne Site, or Great Fraser Midden), is an ancient Musqueam village and burial site located in the Marpole neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia. Also known as the Great Fraser Midden, a thousands-year old deposit of skeletal remains, artifacts, stone and wooden tools, artwork and shells. The village itself was known as . Formerly there was a second residential area near the current one, , known in English as Mahlie.Early Vancouver, Vol. 1, Maj. J. S. Mathews, Vancouver Archives The Musqueam's ancestors, the Coast Salish, have lived in the Fraser River estuary for thousands of years. Their traditional territory encompasses the lands, lakes, and streams defined and included by a line commencing at Harvey Creek in Howe Sound and proceeding eastward to the height of land and continuing on the height of land around the entire watershed draining into English Bay, Burrard Inlet, and Indian Arm; south along the height of land between Coquitlam River and Brunette River to the Fraser River, across to the south or left bank of the Fraser River and proceeding downstream taking in the left bank of the main stream and the South Arm to the sea, including all those intervening lands, islands and waters back along the sea shore to Harvey Creek, and the sea, its reefs, flats, tidal lands, and islands adjacent to the above described land and out to the centre of Georgia Strait. The area of the Musqueam Reserve is the closest Hudson's Bay Company explorer Simon Fraser made it to the Strait of Georgia; he was driven back by hostile Musqueam who had had bad experiences with white men on ships just prior. Chief Whattlekainum of the Kwantlen warned Fraser of an impending attack, thereby saving his life.  Language  Their traditional language is , the Downriver Dialect of the Salishan language Halkomelem, and they are closely related to neighbouring peoples of the lower Fraser River. The nearby Kwantlen and Katzie peoples just upriver share the same dialect, while the upriver Sto:lo people speak another dialect, (known as the Upriver Dialect). The Cowichan, Chemainus, Snuneymuxw and neighbouring Coast Salish peoples of Vancouver Island and the parts of the Gulf Islands of the southern Gulf of Georgia speak another dialect, (usually spelled Hulquminum), often called the Straits dialect, or Island Halkomelem, but not to be confused with North Straits Salish, which is a group of related dialects to the south. In early 2018 the University of British Columbia installed at its main campus 54 street signs in the Musqueam language, written in Americanist phonetic notation. (In 2010, UBC‚Äôs Okanagan satellite campus had put up signs in Nsyilxcen, the language of the Okanagan Nation. Before the 2010 Olympic Games, the British Columbia government installed road signs in Squamish, Lil‚Äôwat and English on the Sea- to-Sky Highway between Whistler and Vancouver, BC.)

He has taught at SUNY Cortland since 1979, and as a visiting professor at Cornell University since 1988. At Cortland, he has served as chair of the Political Science Department from 1983‚Äì1989, 2005‚Äì2006, and from 2008 to 2020. He served as a member of the New York State Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution from 1986‚Äì1990. At Cortland, he teaches many courses in the political science department, including Introduction to American Politics, The American Presidency, the Legislative Process, and Gun Policy. Work =Views on American presidency= In 1983 Spitzer's first book, The Presidency and Public Policy, challenged the model for presidential success espoused by Richard E. Neustadt with a policy approach based on Theodore J. Lowi's \\"arenas of power.\\" Spitzer argued that the type of policy proposed by a president, not personal political skill, shaped the president's success in Congress. Michael A. Genovese felt \\"a more explicit application\\" to Lyndon Johnson's and Ronald Reagan's early years would have improved Spitzer's study, but otherwise gave it a collegial thumbs-up. Prior to 1988's The Presidential Veto, there had been no analytical, book-length account of the subject in almost 100 years. Spitzer's work examines its history and concludes that the presidential veto has lost the revisionary power as the Founder's understood it at the Constitutional Convention. Melvin A. Kulbicki called the book an excellent text and a \\"well-written blend of theory and practical politics.\\" Spitzer served as president of the Presidency Research Group of the American Political Science Association from 2001-2003. =Gun control= Since the 1980s, Spitzer has written books, spoken at public gatherings, written articles for newspapers, and appeared on numerous radio and television shows about gun control. His written work on the subject has appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Daily News. He has appeared on NPR's Fresh Air With Terry Gross and on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann. After former president Jimmy Carter wrote an op-ed about the 1994 assault weapons ban, the New York Times asked its readers, \\"Where do you stand on assault weapons?\\" Spitzer replied that one approach to \\"breaking the political deadlock over gun control\\" would be to treat it like international arms relations and \\"renounce disarmament but embrace arms control, especially for weapons of military origin.\\" Prior to and since the United States Supreme Court rulings in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010), Spitzer also argues that history and prior law do not support the individualist interpretation of the Second Amendment reflected in these two recent court rulings. Since the cases were handed down, he wrote: \\"The Heller and McDonald rulings established, as a matter of law, an individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment. But while judges can change the law, they cannot change history, and the historical record largely contradicts the bases for these two recent rulings.\\" Spitzer is the author of five books on gun control: The Politics of Gun Control, The Right to Bear Arms, Gun Control: A Documentary and Reference Guide, coauthor, along with Glenn H. Utter, of Encyclopedia of Gun Control and Gun Rights and Guns across America: Reconciling Gun Rules and Rightshttps://global.oup.com/academic/product/guns- across-america-9780190228583?cc=us‚ü®=en& =Other work= In addition to the American presidency and gun politics, Spitzer has researched and written on many topics related to American politics and public policy, including the behavior of American institutions, national elections, the mass media, the Constitution, and New York State politics and policy. His monograph The Right to Life Movement and Third Party Politics was a close examination of the New York-based Right to Life political party. His book Saving the Constitution from Lawyers: How Legal Education and Law Reviews Distort Constitutional Meaning, argues that legal training serves the practice of law well, but, according to the Harvard Law Review, \\"presents a sharp critique of the 'wayward constitutional theorizing' published in law journals.\\" Pulitizer Prize winning historian Jack Rakove said of this book, \\"Nowhere is the gap between pretension and performance [in legal education] more evident than in the realm of constitutional law, and Robert Spitzer explains why.\\" Since 1997, Spitzer has been series editor for the book series on American Constitutionalism published by SUNY Press. Personal life and education Spitzer was born in Utica, New York in 1953.

The name is derived from the Greek word philo meaning \\"beloved\\" and the French word mont or \\"mountain\\"; Philomont means \\"beloved mountain.\\" History The village was established in the 19th century by Quakers. Minor skirmishes occurred in the area during the Civil War and troops from both sides routinely moved through Philomont. The famed Confederate irregulars \\"Mosby's Raiders\\" (also known as Mosby's Rangers) were active in the area throughout the war. Philomont lies within the Mosby Heritage Area. Geography Philomont is located in the heart of Virginia's \\"Hunt Country,\\" just six miles north of Middleburg and about five miles south of Purcellville. The greater Philomont area is known for horse farms, large estates, winding gravel roads, rolling hills and stacked stone walls. Philomont lies on the flanks of the relatively small Catoctin Mountain and to the west of the community lies the Blue Ridge Mountains. The village boasts an active community center,http://www.co.loudoun.va.us/prcs/cc/philomont.htm volunteer fire department and the Philomont Store as well as several bed & breakfast retreats.http://www.jpathouse.com/ According to the Journal of the Philomont Historical Association the original Philomont Store opened in 1843 with the name Milhollen Brothers. Today the Philomont Store features a selection of wines, beer, and \\"pulled pork\\" sandwiches. The Philomont area has seen significant development over the past decade. The village is located in one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States.http://www.co.loudoun.va.us/business/growth/ However, the rural flavor of the area has been largely retained. In fact it is one of only two towns in the Commonwealth which residents must pick up their mail at the General Store. The region is popular with day-trippers from the Washington, D. C. metropolitan area to the east as well as bicyclists and motorcyclists. The village is located along the scenic and historic Snickersville Pike, a State Scenic Byway. The \\"Pike\\" runs for approximately 16 miles from U.S. Route 50 in Aldie to the village of Bluemont on Blue Ridge Mountain.  Annual events One of the village's seminal annual events is the Fire Department Barbecue held in May. This fundraiser features slow cooked beef with BBQ sauce and all the fixings and sides including a baked potato, coleslaw, salad and green beans. The second annual Philomont PHair took place on April 24‚Äì25, 2010. The PHair is composed of local artisans, growers, plant vendors and commercial garden-themed retailers selling garden-themed items. Free parking was available at the Philomont Community Center. A delicious lunch was available for a nominal fee of $5.00. The entire community looks forward to the third annual Philomont Phair on April 30, 2011 and invites everyone out for an enjoyable \\"Day in the Country.\\" A third event is the annual Philomont Horse Show, held on the fourth Saturday in April. The show has been running since the 1950s and is a major fundraiser for the Philomont Fire Department. It used to be a rated show (even olympian Joe Fargis showed at Philomont in the early days), but the show is now on the VHSA and DCAHSA local circuit. The well- attended show boasts 2 grass rings and holds all the regular VHSA classes as well as fun classes like a Hunter Derby and pairs classes. Notable residents The village earned a reputation with traditional outdoors men and the social elite when actor Robert Duvall purchased an 1800s horse farm in close proximity to the General Store. Occasional evenings one would find the likes of Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash at Duvall's cabin playing impromptu sessions along with Duvall. Philomont was the home of the Stephen Roszell family, early converts to the Methodist Faith, as the result of frequent visits from itinerant horseback riding Francis Asbury, co-worker with the Wesley brothers who brought their faith to this country. The Roszell farmhouse \\"Shelburne\\" still exists today, on the Snickersville Pike, with its adjoining family cemetery. Also still in regular use and a center of the community is the historic Roszell United Methodist Church, named in honor of The Rev. Stephen Roszell, one of the early Methodist preachers.

Construction The creation of Glasgow Harbour by Clydeport (formerly the Clyde Navigation Trust) required the demolition of their massive Meadowside Granary complex in 2002. After many years of dereliction caused by the decline of shipbuilding and the migration of Glasgow's docks to the Firth of Clyde, since the mid-1980s the banks of the River Clyde at Glasgow have become a focus for property developers. Mirroring the London Docklands scheme, the old docks, and sites of old granaries, wharves and shipyards in Glasgow are being redeveloped into up-market residential apartments, office complexes and leisure facilities. The earliest developments were the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) at the former Queen's Dock in 1985, and the Glasgow Garden Festival at the former Prince's Dock in 1988, which demonstrated the potential of the riverside area as a catalyst for urban regeneration. Through the 1990s, riverside apartment buildings began to appear at Lancefield Quay on the North bank and the former General Terminus Quay on the South bank, and the Norman Foster-designed Clyde Auditorium was opened at the SECC in 1997. The former Garden Festival site is now home to the Glasgow Science Centre including Glasgow Tower (the tallest structure in the city and the spiritual successor to the Clydesdale Bank tower which was part of the Garden Festival). There has been further development at this site, with new headquarters for BBC Scotland and Scottish Television at Pacific Quay forming the cornerstone of a new \\"media village\\". Buildings and phases Phase 1 of the Glasgow Harbour Project, by the Clyde Port Authority at the former Meadowside Granary, Yorkhill Quay and confluence of the River Kelvin in Partick, has consisted of high rise residential accommodation and the construction of a riverside walkway. View from Govan across the River Clyde towards the Glenlee, the Riverside Museum and Glasgow Harbour apartments The wider area now includes the Riverside Museum (the city's new Museum of Transport) adjacent to the mouth of the River Kelvin, and there are plans for large-scale commercial developments at the site. In September 2006, the Clyde Arc road bridge opened to traffic, enhancing access to the South Bank at the SECC, while the existing Clydeside Expressway (A814) dual carriageway connects the Harbour area to Glasgow city centre and the Clyde Tunnel. Transport links will also be a key feature of Glasgow Harbour in the future, with a pre-light rail metro system planned, to be called Clyde Fastlink, which will link the area to the city centre areas, with possible interchanges to the Subway. An intermittent ferry service operates between the Riverside Museum and Govan on the south bank.

It was established in 1929, and added to the National Register of Historical Places in 1986. History The \\"Balboa\\" got its name from the coastal Balboa Peninsula at Newport Beach, California. People from the Los Angeles area who'd seen it started referring to it as 'The Balboa', or the dance being done in Balboa. In its day, the Balboa Inn was the number one hostelry on the Orange County Coast and the present day \\"Balboa Inn Resort\\" is popular. Balboa Inn The Inn has been remodeled and modernized a number of times but its graceful Spanish Colonial Revival architecture remains. At one time the Balboa Theater, operated by the colorful, hard-drinking, hard- swearing character Madame La Rue, stood next to the Balboa Inn. The Balboa Inn was, and still is, a favorite getaway spot for Hollywood stars. For example, Olympic athlete and Tarzan star Johnny Weissmueller stayed there. Legend has it that Weissmueller swam the distance between the Balboa Pier and Newport Pier on a regular basis. A current famous room at the Inn is Kareem Abdul- Jabbar's Suite with its nine (9) foot high doors. =Balboa dance= The origins of the 'Balboa' dance resist consensus. Many dance historians state that the dance was a derivation of the Foxtrot, others believe it evolved from the Charleston or Collegiate Shag. Willie Desatof, an original Balboa dancer of distinction, believes it evolved from the Rhumba. There were many different existing dances around at the time of the Balboa's introduction, and several of the 'Balboa masters' knew of them. Balboa is an 8 count dance, so a connection with other 8 count dances would be consistent. However, it does not rule out a connection to 6 count dances. It seems likely that early Balboa dancers were probably influenced by their knowledge of other dances around at that time. \\"We can't tell you how to dance Balboa, but we can tell you when you are not dancing Balboa.\\" from dancers of Balboa's origin. Nearby attractions Nearby historical buildings and sights and sites include the Balboa Pavilion (est. 1906), Balboa Pier (est. 1906), Balboa Fun Zone (est. 1936), and Balboa Island Ferry (est. 1919). Activities nearby include the beach, narrated harbor cruises and sport fishing, the Catalina Island passenger ferry dock, restaurants, and shops. During large south ocean swells, the nearby world-famous Wedge provides dangerous and exciting surfing entertainment.

angel Ithuriel by Evelyn De Morgan, before 1900. Ithuriel (Hebrew: \\"Discovery of God\\") is the name of a being mentioned in the writings of the Kabbala and in 16th century conjuring books. He is one of the three deputy sarim (princes) of the holy sefiroth serving in the ethnarchy of the angel Sephuriron. The name Ithuriel occurs in the 16th-century tracts of Isaac ha- Cohen of Soria, where the term is interpreted as denoting \\"a great golden crown\\"; and in Moses ben Jacob Cordovero's work Pardes Rimmonim (Orchard of Pomegranates). Earlier sources may yet be found. The name appears also in the grimoires, as in the 1st pentacle of the planet Mars, figured in Mathers', The Greater Key of Solomon (1889), p. 63\\\\. In the poem Paradise Lost IV, 778, 788, John Milton refers to Ithuriel as a cherub (\\"mistakenly,\\" says Gershom Scholem) who, along with the angel Zephon, is dispatched by Gabriel to locate Satan. The \\"grieslie King\\" is discovered in the Garden of Eden \\"squat like a Toad close at the ear of Eve.\\" By touching Satan with his spear, Ithuriel causes the Tempter to resume his proper likeness. This incident is illustrated in William Hayley's edition of Milton's works (London, 1794). In John Dryden's work The State of Innocence, Ithuriel is part of the cast of characters as one of 4 angels. It is evident from the sources cited that Milton did not invent the name of Ithuriel (or the names of Abdiel or Zophiel, as certain Milton scholars have claimed).Robert H.

Washington, D.C.: Congressional Globe 1858;8 Ithuriel is also mentioned in the poem The Hour of the Angel by Rudyard Kipling about final judgement. The poem refers to the hour of judgement, the \\"final hour\\", as \\"Ithuriel's Hour\\". Ithuriel's spear is also mentioned in his poem Dinah in Heaven, with the dog of the title \\"Storming against Ithuriel's Spear/That only proved her truth!.\\" Ithuriel appeared in Th√©ophile Gautier's poem \\"Les Yeux Bleus de la Montagne\\", which referred the jewelry as joyaux tomb√©s du doigt de l'ange Ithuriel (\\"jewels fallen from the finger of the angel Ithuriel\\"). Gautier also mentions Ithuriel in his 1832 poem \\"Notre- Dame\\". Once again, Ithuriel is evoked in the context of jewels, which here describe the colors of the sky as the sun sets in summer behind Notre-Dame cathedral: \\"Ce ne sont que saphirs, coralines, opales, Tons √† faire trouver Rubens et Titien p√¢les; Ithuriel r√©pand son √©crin dans les cieux.\\" Ithuriel is mentioned in two poems by Victor Hugo.

Ithuriel is referenced in Thomas Hardy's work The Return of the Native when Venn slaps Wildeve on the shoulder. Ithuriel is referenced in Daniel Deronda by George Eliot, in Chapter 61. \\"Mirah's face, with a look of anger that might have suited Ithuriel.\\" In the Key of Solomon, Ithuriel, Eschiel, Madimiel, and Bartzachiah are the four angel-names on the First Talisman of Mars. In Mark Twain's The Canvasser's Tale Ithuriel is the name of the uncle of the \\"sad-eyed stranger\\". Ithuriel is also a fictional character, an angel, who had been summoned and tortured by Valentine in Book 3: City of Glass of the Mortal Instruments Trilogy by Cassandra Clare, also appearing in Clockwork Princess, the conclusion of prequel series [The Infernal Devices] as a spirit entrapped within the clockwork angel locket belonging to Tessa Gray. In Aleister Crowley's Liber Liberi vel Lapidis Lazuli Adumbratio Kabbal√¶ √Ügyptiorum sub figur√¢ VII, the Holy Guardian Angel is described as \\"Ithuriel the strong\\". > Then said Ithuriel the strong; let Us also worship this invisible marvel! :‚Äî > VII 3:27 The Spear is represented in Alan Moore's Watchmen comic book series by the Chrysler Building in New York City.Watchmen Unmasked.

The Angel Ithuriel is featured in the TV-Series Shadowhunters, taken by Valentine Morgenstern and being tortured. Clary Fray also has a blood connection to Ithuriel, that she is able to create new runes that are not documented on the Gray Book, but sent to her as a vision from Ithuriel himself.

It is used by injection under the skin once to twice a day. Onset of effects is typically in 90 minutes and they last for 24 hours. Versions are available that come premixed with a short-acting insulin, such as regular insulin. The common side effect is low blood sugar. Other side effects may include pain or skin changes at the sites of injection, low blood potassium, and allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy is relatively safe for the baby. NPH insulin is made by mixing regular insulin and protamine in exact proportions with zinc and phenol such that a neutral-pH is maintained and crystals form. There are human and pig insulin based versions. Protamine insulin was first created in 1936 and NPH insulin in 1946. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. NPH is an abbreviation for \\"neutral protamine Hagedorn\\". Medical use NPH insulin is cloudy and has an onset of 1‚Äì4 hours. Its peak is 6‚Äì10 hours and its duration is about 10‚Äì16 hours. It has an intermediate duration of action, meaning longer than that of regular and rapid-acting insulin, and shorter than long acting insulins (ultralente, glargine or detemir). History Hans Christian Hagedorn (1888‚Äì1971) and August Krogh (1874‚Äì1949) obtained the rights for insulin from Banting and Best in Toronto, Canada. In 1923 they formed Nordisk Insulin laboratorium, and in 1926 with August Kongsted he obtained a Danish Royal Charter as a non-profit foundation. In 1936, Hagedorn and B. Norman Jensen discovered that the effects of injected insulin could be prolonged by the addition of protamine obtained from the \\"milt\\" or semen of river trout. The insulin would be added to the protamine, but the solution would have to be brought to pH 7 for injection. University of Toronto, Canada later licensed protamine zinc insulin (PZI), to several manufacturers. This mixture only needed to be shaken before injection. The effects of PZI lasted for 24‚Äì36 h. In 1946, Nordisk was able to form crystals of protamine and insulin and marketed it in 1950 as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. NPH insulin has the advantage that it can be mixed with an insulin that has a faster onset to complement its longer lasting action, which is the primary reason NPH remains on the market today, because manufacturers sell a variety of premixed insulin formulations. Eventually all animal insulins made by Novo Nordisk were replaced by synthetic, recombinant 'human' insulin. Synthetic 'human' insulin is also complexed with protamine to form NPH. =Timeline= *1926 Nordisk receives Danish charter to produce insulin *1936 Hagedorn discovers that adding protamine to insulin prolongs the effect of insulin *1936 Canadians D.M.

He served in the Virginia House of Delegates and represented Virginia in the United States Senate. Early and family life Benjamin Watkins Leigh was born in Chesterfield County on June 18, 1781, the son of the Reverend William Leigh (d. 1787) and Elizabeth (Watkins) Leigh (d. 1799). He attended the College of William and Mary, studied law, and began practicing in Petersburg in 1802, as well as helped raise his younger brother William. Benjamin Watkins Leigh married three times: on December 24, 1802, to Mary Selden Watkins; on November 30, 1813, to Susan Colston; on November 24, 1821, to Julia Wickham. Career After representing Dinwiddie County in the Virginia House of Delegates 1811-13, Leigh moved to Richmond, where he rose rapidly in his chosen profession. He prepared the revised Code of Virginia in 1819, was a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830, a reporter of the Virginia Court of Appeals 1829-41, and was again elected to the Virginia legislature, representing Henrico County in the session of 1830-31. Leigh was appointed by the state legislature as a Whig to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William Cabell Rives; he was reelected in 1835. During Leigh's time in the Senate, the controversy over slavery reached new levels of intensity. The House of Representatives passed a \\"gag rule\\" tabling all anti-slavery petitions, and a similar measure died in the Senate, though that body approved an alternate method of ignoring such petitions. President Jackson called on the Congress to censor anti-slavery publications from the federal mails, a bill the Senate defeated 25-19. Leigh proposed a statewide boycott of pro-emancipation newspapers, writing that Virginians had the right \\"to suppress to the utmost of our power what we deem inflammatory, dangerous, mischievous.\\"Dunn, Susan. Dominion of Memories: Jefferson, Madison, & the Decline of Virginia, 195. Every State had expressed the disapproval of South Carolina's nullification and it was Leigh who was sent to urge South Carolina to desist from carrying matters to extremities. Leigh served until his resignation on July 4, 1836. Thereafter he resumed the practice of law in Richmond. Benjamin Watkins Leigh was a founding member (1831) of the Virginia Historical Society and first chairman of its standing committee. Death and legacy Leigh died in Richmond on February 2, 1849, and is buried in Shockoe Hill Cemetery. His home at Richmond, the Benjamin Watkins Leigh House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. References Sources *Dictionary of American Biography *Dunn, Susan.

It was built between 1698 and 1700,, p.20, p.178 making it the oldest church in Pennsylvania and second oldest Swedish church in the United States after Holy Trinity Church (Old Swedes) in Wilmington, Delaware.

Colonial Records of the Swedish Churches in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia: Swedish Colonial Society, 2006., v. 2, p154. The church displays the English vernacular style of church design, which combines elements of the Medieval and Gothic styles. The church's vestry and entranceway were added in 1703 to buttress the walls, which had begun to buckle under the weight of the roof. The tower was added c.1733, and interior alterations were made in 1845, designed by Samuel Sloan. The congregation dates to 1677, five years before the founding of the city of Philadelphia, and the graveyard around the church to about the same time. Formerly a Swedish Lutheran congregation, the church has been Episcopalian since 1845.

Swedish pioneers of New Sweden were the first to settle the area in 1646. An existing blockhouse at Wicaco (now South Philadelphia), had been renovated for worship in 1677 and was used until the present church (built beginning in 1697) was consecrated on the First Sunday after Trinity, July 2, 1700.O'Connor, Mary Eileen, Gloria Dei \\"Old Swedes\\" Church (Holy Philadelphia highlights region's religious diversity), Holy Philadelphia, an original WHYY program)G. Sj√∂blom, \\"The 75-Year-Old Gloria Dei Church and Its Predecessor 1891-1966\\" A fire destroyed many of the church records in 1740. Colonial painter Gustavus Hesselius was a member here.Records of Holy Trinity Church (Old Swedes') Church, Wilmington, Delaware. Separate Index, 1730. In 1703, Gloria Dei was the site of the first regular Lutheran ordination in the Americas, that of Justus Falckner, a German theology student. Jenny Lind sang here during one of her American tours. Hanging in the center aisle is a Swedish chandelier given by famous Swedish artist Carl Milles. Recollections of many Swedish royal and episcopal visits are treasured memories, including models of Fogel Grip and Kalmar Nyckel, the first Swedish ships to arrive in New Sweden.Williams, Rev. Dr. Kim-Eric The Eight Old Swedes' Churches of New Sweden (Wilmington, DE: New Sweden Center, 1999) The church has a collection of historical and religious artifacts the church has acquired over three centuries, including bronze crosses and 18th century Bibles in Swedish and English. In 1845, the formerly Swedish Lutheran congregation joined the Episcopal Church. Today the church is owned and maintained by its congregation of Episcopalians.Ashmead, Henry Graham, History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania (Chapter II, Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Co. 1884) The church was designated a National Historic Site on November 17, 1942. It is an affiliated area of the National Park Service under Independence National Historical Park. The church site is owned and administered by the Corporation of Gloria Dei (Old Swedes') Church.

Originally from Montgomery, Georgia, Snider later moved to Philadelphia, but died in poverty in Kilburn, London, England while attempting to recover promised compensation from the British government. He was survived by his wife Angelina and several sons, and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. Snider worked for the Pennsylvania Institute for the Blind, and in 1833, he produced the first raised print book in the United States. His method, which involved carving the letters into a sheet of copper by hand, was soon abandoned.

It was named after Reykjanes, the southwestern tip of Reykjanesskagi. The region has a population of 27,829 (2020) and is one of the more densely populated parts of the island. The administrative centre is Keflav√≠k, which had 7,000 residents when it merged with the nearby town of Njar√∞v√≠k and Hafnir several years ago to create Reykjanesb√¶r, which now (feb 2019) is the largest settlement outside the Greater Reykjav√≠k area; on 1 January 2013 the town had a population of 14,231, but 17,805 in 2018. The region is the location of Keflav√≠k International Airport, the major point of entry for Iceland, and also the Blue Lagoon health spa. The peninsula is marked by active volcanism under its surface, and large lava fields, allowing little vegetation. There are numerous hot springs and sulphur springs in the southern half of the peninsula, around the Kleifarvatn lake and the Kr√Ωsuv√≠k geothermal area. There is also a geothermal power station at Svartsengi. Near the power station a luxury spa and pool area has been installed using the hot and mineralized water coming down from the power station; it is known as the \\"Blue Lagoon\\" (Bl√°a L√≥ni√∞). The Bridge Between Continents spans the √Ålfagj√° rift valley (60 feet wide and deep) near Grindavik, which marks the boundary of the Eurasian and North American continental tectonic plates. It was built in 2002 and previously named Leif the Lucky bridge in honor of Icelandic explorer Leif Eriksson who traveled from Europe to America nearly 500 years before Christopher Columbus. Some fishing towns, such as Grindav√≠k, Njar√∞v√≠k and Sandger√∞i are situated on the peninsula as well as the town of Keflav√≠k, the site of Keflav√≠k International Airport and the Leifur Eriksson Air Terminal and the former American military base.

The highest of the system's multiple vents is 230 metres (754 ft). Dredging operations resulted in recovery of basaltic rocks of probable Holocene age. Most of the subaerial part of the system is covered by Holocene-age lava fields. During the 13th century, the last subaerial eruptions occurred along the Reykjanes fissure system. Tephra deposits from Holocene eruptions have been preserved on the Reykjanes Peninsula.

As with other supposed baseball curses, such as the crosstown Chicago Cubs' Curse of the Billy Goat, or the Boston Red Sox' Curse of the Bambino, these \\"curses\\" have been publicized by the popular media over the course of time. The curse: 1920 to 1958 The White Sox were dealt a severe blow in 1919 by the Black Sox scandal, with several star players being suspended at a crucial time late in the 1920 season. Conventional wisdom has it that the Sox were headed for another pennant and championship and that the suspensions knocked them out of the race. In reality, the last game for the \\"Eight Men Out\\" was September 27, just three games from the end of their season. At that point the Sox had won 3 in a row and were sitting at 95-56 with 3 games to play. The Cleveland Indians were also in a hot streak, at 94-54 with 6 games to play, and halfway through a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Browns. The Indians were just a few percentage points ahead of the White Sox. The Indians would close the season with 4 wins and 2 losses, and finish with a 98-56 record. The Sox would lose 2 of their final 3 to finish 96-58.1920 Chicago White Sox at Baseball Reference If the Sox had swept their final series against the Browns and the Indians record stayed the same, the American League would have had its first pennant playoff. Even discounting any morale boost the Indians might have received from the news of the Sox players' suspensions, the Sox return to the World Series was by no means ensured, even if there had been no suspensions. If they had finished tied, it would be noted that the Indians had won 12 of the clubs' 22 meetings, but the Sox had taken 2 of 3 in their most recent series. In any case, the Sox finished in second place, two games behind the Indians, who went on to win (and make some history) in the 1920 World Series. However, the New York Yankees, who finished in third place just a game behind the Sox in Babe Ruth's first year with the club, would go on to win the next three American League pennants, starting a dynasty that would be a difficult hurdle for the other AL clubs, including the White Sox, for many decades thereafter. With the players' suspensions becoming permanent, the Sox fell to seventh place in 1921. It would be the mid-1930s before the team returned to the upper half of the league, and the early 1950s before they became regular contenders again. The curse: 1959 to 2005 When the White Sox finally won their next pennant, in 1959, Jack Brickhouse called the final out of the pennant-clinching game: \\"A forty year wait has now ended!\\" At that time, four decades was the longest stretch any major league team had gone without a World Series appearance (the crosstown Cubs had only gone 14 years after winning their last pennant). In that sense, the Black Sox \\"curse\\", or the apparent pall cast over the franchise for some decades in the wake of the scandal, had also finally ended. Despite the team's pennant victory, however, they lost the 1959 World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. The White Sox remained competitive for the next several years, but were not quite good enough to win. After a slump, they became contenders again starting in the late 1970s, and qualified for post-season play by winning the American League West division title in 1983 and 1993 and the American League Central division title in 2000. The \\"curse\\" discussion was revived by the national media during the 2005 post- season, when the Sox won their first league championship since 1959 (an even longer wait than before, 46 years). During the ensuing 2005 World Series, the White Sox swept the Houston Astros for their first World Series championship in 88 years (87 if the cancelled 1994 World Series is excluded). Some of this discussion found its way to the official World Series film DVD. For example, White Sox center fielder Aaron Rowand, in an interview for the DVD, compared the 2004 Red Sox with the 2005 White Sox: \\"If they could break their 'curse', so could we.\\" In one of those ways that patterns appear to emerge in sporting events, the White Sox World Series win in 2005, along with the Boston Red Sox win in 2004, symmetrically bookended the two teams' previous World Series winners and the long gaps between, with the Red Sox and White Sox last Series wins having come in 1918 and 1917, respectively. Skeptics There is a large faction of White Sox fans who dismiss the idea of a curse against the White Sox as a ridiculous (yet successful) ploy by the national media to sensationalize the team in efforts for increased ratings, instead attributing their drought to the more obvious reason: team mismanagement. The Comiskeys were very conservative spenders (which many hypothesize to be the reason that the Black Sox scandal even occurred in the first place) and it was not until 1958 that the family gave up majority ownership to Bill Veeck, who was an innovative marketer but lacked sufficient resources to compete with wealthier teams. Ownership then passed to the Allyn brothers, who almost moved the team to Milwaukee while mediocre on-field performance continued. The team was then reacquired by Veeck, who sold it to current majority owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who also owns the NBA's Chicago Bulls on the West Side of town.

He was known as the \\"Jackie Wilson of Jamaica\\" and was also a gifted dancer. In the early 1960s, he was discovered by Byron Lee, the band master of the Dragonaires, who brought him to Jamaica. His styles included ska, R&B;, soul, gospel and calypso. He is credited with inventing spouge music, a fusion of ska, calypso, and R&B; music. Opel performed duos with Doreen Schaffer and Hortense Ellis, and in 1964 was backed by Wailers Bob Marley and Peter Tosh on \\"Mill Man\\", \\"Hairy Mango\\" and \\"A time to cry\\" and maybe some others like \\"I Don¬¥t Want Her\\". Opel eventually moved to Trinidad and then subsequently returned home to Barbados. On 9 March 1970, he died in a car crash on Lower Bay Street, Bridgetown, Barbados.

It is situated in West Street, near Cambridge Circus in London, opposite the Ambassadors and St Martin's theatres. The Ivy now has branches in Britain and Ireland.. History The original restaurant was opened by Abel Giandolini in 1917 as an unlicensed Italian cafe in a building on the same site. Legend has it that the name itself originated from a chance remark by the actress Alice Delysia, who overheard Giandolini apologise to a customer for the inconvenience caused by building works. When he said that it was because of his intention to create a restaurant of the highest class, she interjected \\"Don't worry ‚Äì we will always come and see you. 'We will cling together like the ivy'\\", a line from the then-popular song, 1902's \\"Just Like the Ivy I'll Cling to You\\", written by AJ Mills and Harry Castling. The restaurant expanded into the current premises in 1929 run by Giandolini, with his longstanding Maitre d' Mario Gallati as host. In part due to its proximity to the West End theatres, exclusivity and late closing time (it is still open until close to midnight), the restaurant quickly became a theatrical institution, with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, Marlene Dietrich, John Gielgud, Lilian Braithwaite, Terence Rattigan, Binkie Beaumont and No√´l Coward being habitu√©s, having their regular 2-seater tables along the walls. According to the actor Donald Sinden in his Sky Arts television documentary series Great West End Theatres, The Ivy became so famous as a theatrical-celebrities haunt that in the 1943 revue Sweet and Low which ran for almost six years at the neighbouring Ambassadors Theatre, there was a satirical sketch included, updated regularly, entitled Poison Ivy, where the show's star Hermione Gingold \\"would exchange wicked and salacious celebrity gossip\\".Great West End Theatres episode 5. St Martins Theatre In 1950 Giandolini sold The Ivy to Bernard Walsh and the restaurant became part of his Wheeler's group of fish restaurants. Subsequent owners were Lady Grade and the Forte Foundation. It then closed in 1989 and Jeremy King and Chris Corbin, who owned Le Caprice, bought it. The restaurant was totally renovated to a design by American architect MJ Long incorporating specially-commissioned artworks by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi, Sir Peter Blake, Sir Howard Hodgkin, Bridget Riley, Allen Jones, Joe Tilson, Patrick Caulfield, Michael Craig-Martin and Tom Phillips. Fernando Peire was appointed Senior Ma√Ætre d'. The restaurant opened in June 1990 and became a sensation. Peire left The Ivy in December 1998, three months after the restaurant was sold to Belgo PLC as part of Caprice Holdings Ltd.; Corbin and King departed two years later and went on to establish their own Rex Restaurants (now Corbin & King). The restaurant seats 100 guests and there is also a private dining room on the first floor of the restaurant, seating up to 60 guests. Mobile phones and cameras are forbidden anywhere in the restaurant or adjoining club and there is a dress code, where smart casual attire is required. A recipe book, written by the restaurant critic A. A. Gill and titled The Ivy: The Restaurant and its Recipes was published in 1997. The Ivy was the inspiration for the restaurant of the same name in Los Angeles, though they are unconnected. In 2000, the restaurant was awarded the Mo√´t & Chandon London Restaurant Award for excellence. In 2005 the entrepreneur Richard Caring bought The Ivy and the Caprice Holdings group, which also owns Le Caprice, which is located behind the Ritz in the St James's area of London, the fish restaurant J. Sheekey, located near Leicester Square, Scotts in Mount Street and 34 in Grosvenor Square. In 2007 Fernando Peire returned to The Ivy in 2007 and was appointed Director of The Ivy and The Club at The Ivy. Gary Lee, who had previously been in charge of Private Functions at The Ivy, returned as Head Chef and was appointed Executive Chef in 2008. Executive Chef Director of Caprice Holdings restaurants (now Caprice Group) is Tim Hughes. The Club at The Ivy In September 2008, The Club at The Ivy, a private members' club with a hidden entrance via an adjacent flower-shop, was opened on the three floors above the restaurant, with membership (drawn primarily from creative industries and the arts) \\"as hard to get as a table at The Ivy itself\\" according to the author A. A. Gill. It boasts a Piano Lounge; a dining room (\\"The Drawing Room\\"), open for breakfast, lunch and supper; a wood-panelled library \\"of books that reflect many of our members‚Äô interests in art, literature, film, theatre, architecture and design\\"; a film screening- room and entertainment space known as the Loft; a further private dining-room seating up to 14 people and a cigar-terrace. Its director is Fernando Peire, the former Senior Ma√Ætre d', who is also widely known from the Channel 5 TV series The Restaurant Inspector.

Accessed May 8, 2017. History left Founded in 1907 by Frank Sutliff Hackett (1878‚Äì1952) and his first wife, Francis Dean (Allen) Hackett, Riverdale Country School is one of the oldest country day schools in the United States. Originally known as the Riverdale School for Boys, it began with 12 students and four teachers and promised scholarly, intimate teaching amid abundant recreational space. Describing his school as \\"an American experiment in education,\\" Hackett later told The New York Times: \\"We have tried to transform schools from mere nurseries of the brain into a means of nourishing the whole boy ‚Äî mind, body, and spirit.\\"Hanley, Robert. \\"New Headmaster to Take Over At Riverdale as It Turns Coed\\", The New York Times, February 3, 1972. Accessed May 8, 2017. \\"The exclusive school in the Bronx is becoming fully coeducational after 37 years of maintaining separate campuses for boys and girls.\\" An early advocate of outdoor experiences for young people, Hackett started a summer camp known as Camp Riverdale at Long Lake in the Adirondacks (1912‚Äì1964) to provide summer recreation for his students. By 1920, Hackett had acquired three acres on Fieldston Road for the school and built a classroom building and dormitory. The 100-room dormitory, designed by McKim, Mead, and White, later became known as Hackett Hall. In 1924, he started the Neighborhood School for boys and girls from grades one to three, and in 1933, the Riverdale Girls School. By World War II, the school attracted both day students and boarders; one student in six or seven came from another country.Quickened Spirit: A Biography of Frank S.

In 1972, the Boys and Girls Schools were combined. In 1985, the Middle and Upper Schools were consolidated on the Hill Campus and the Lower School moved to the River Campus. Hackett was an organizer of the Guild of Independent Schools of New York City, and an organizer and president of the Adirondack Mountain Club.Dr. Frank Hackett obituary, The New York Times, February 7, 1952 President John F. Kennedy attended the school from 1927 to 1930 when his family lived in Riverdale. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy made an appearance in the Bronx. \\"I said up the street that I was a former resident of the Bronx,\\" he said. \\"Nobody believes that, but it is true. No other candidate for the presidency can make that statement.\\" Campuses Mow Hall on the Hill Campus of Riverdale Country School The Upper Learning Building, completed in 2016, on the River Campus of Riverdale Country School Covering , the Hill Campus is located on Fieldston Road, overlooking Van Cortlandt Park.

Bertino Memorial field) and tennis courts. The Marc A. Zambetti '80 Athletic Center includes a gymnasium, fencing room, and workout room. It was recently renovated to add a second gymnasium and an expanded health/fitness center. The River Campus (Pre-K to 5th) sits on along the Hudson River. The buildings on the River Campus are the Early Learning Building (Pre-K through second grade classrooms and the gymnasium), the Senior Building (classrooms for drawing, painting, and sculpture), the Admissions/Junior building (includes the Lower School head's office, the Learning Commons, and Admissions, and the Upper Learning Building. Completed in 2016, the Upper Learning Building includes a theater, cafeteria, classrooms for third through fifth grade, and multi-purpose spaces. Architectural Record noted: \\"It is a building born of exploration, deep discussions with educators about their needs and desires, and a willingness to tweak on the fly.\\" The River Campus also has tennis courts, a playing field, a greenhouse, gardens, and a playground. The land for the River Campus was given to Riverdale by the family of George Walbridge Perkins, an early environmentalist and associate of Theodore Roosevelt and J.P. Morgan. The family also donated their adjacent property, Wave Hill, to the City of New York for a public garden and cultural center.https://riverdalenature.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/06/architectural-reduced.pdf Academics Becoming Riverdale's sixth head of school in 2007, Dominic A.A. Randolph refined the school‚Äôs mission with a focus on ‚ÄúMind, Character, and Community.‚Äù He eliminated courses tied to Advanced Placement tests, and advocated a teaching philosophy centered on building character strengths. Working with Angela Duckworth, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and Dave Levin, the co-founder of the KIPP network of charter schools, he co-founded Character Lab, an organization dedicated to providing research-based approaches to character education. In 2016, Riverdale Country School launched Plussed, a non-profit designed to \\"create a dynamic collective of experts on learning designing ways to improve student learning and education.\\" https://plussed.org/why/ To encourage innovative teaching, Randolph has advocated design thinking, a methodology used to create and test new ideas. Riverdale teachers collaborated with the design firm, IDEO, on the Design Thinking Toolkit for Educators in 2011. That work led to the formation of The Teachers Guild, in 2015. https://9494b7add7fcd9588a83-1f69badc2e0d0c2f55d8bfc02212a52e.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/Impact%20Report%202015-2016/Teachers%20Guild%20Impact%20Report%202017-02-28.pdf The Teachers Guild is a partnership between IDEO and Riverdale Country School's Plussed initiative that provides teachers with a forum for sharing innovating teaching strategies. In addition to college-preparatory courses in math, science, and humanities, Riverdale offers ‚Äúmaker‚Äù programs that combine science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics, as well as courses in robotics and coding. Latin, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese also are offered. Interdisciplinary courses in the Lower, Middle, and Upper Schools encourage students to draw connections across disciplines. Constructing America, a required course for juniors, is co-taught by the History and English faculty. Integrated Liberal Studies, a required course for seniors, explores four essential topics: Virtue, the Self, Social Justice, and the Environment. Independent study opportunities allow students to gain in-depth knowledge in subjects of their choosing. The Global Studies program organizes trips around the world. An outdoor educator organizes hiking, camping and rock-climbing trips in the Hudson Valley, trekking in Patagonia, and kayaking in Alaska.

History There is great dispute regarding the actual founding date of the Trondheim Cathedral, but the most common theory is that the school was founded in approximately 1152 and is hence the oldest school in Norway. The oldest part of the present school is the Harsdorff building (Munkegata 8), which was completed in 1786. The building is named after its designer Caspar Harsdorff, a royal Danish architect. Originally though, the school's design was submitted by a local architect/organist/fireman, but upon review by the Danish king it was turned down and his royal architect assigned with designing the school. It was funded by Thomas Angell (1692‚Äì1767), a Trondheim merchant. Festival Hall on the second floor has two marble reliefs by noted Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770‚Äì1844). In 1920, the school underwent a major expansion, with buildings designed by Norwegian architect Carl J. Moe (1889‚Äì1942). Programs Trondheim Cathedral School Trondheim Cathedral School offers three programs: study specialized education programs, education programs for music, dance and drama as well as media and communication. The school has a separate dance and music program, offers Latin courses and the IB Diploma course for local students who want to travel abroad or for international students who move to the city. The school is part of UNESCO's Associated Schools Project Network (ASPnet.) In addition, the school has an international program, where the study course is structured so that students take the first and the third school year at Trondheim Cathedral School, while they have taken their second school year in Norfolk, England.

Basic course  A preliminary basic course was an important part of the new teaching method that was developed at Vkhutemas, and was made compulsory for all students, regardless of their future specialization. This was based on a combination of scientific and artistic disciplines. During the basic course, students had to learn the language of plastic forms, and chromatics. Drawing was considered a foundation of the plastic arts, and students investigated relationships between color and form, and the principles of spatial composition. Akin to the Bauhaus's basic course, which all first-year students were required to attend, it gave a more abstract foundation to the technical work in the studios. In the early 1920s this basic course consisted of the following: # the maximal influence of color (given by Lyubov Popova), # form through color (Alexander Osmerkin), # color in space (Aleksandra Ekster) # color on the plane (Ivan Kliun), # construction (Alexander Rodchenko), # simultaneity of form and color (Aleksandr Drevin), # volume in space (Nadezhda Udaltsova), # history of the Western arts (Amshey Nurenberg) and # tutelage by Wladimir Baranoff- Rossine.Alexander Rodchenko, Experiments for the Future, Museum of Modern Art, 2005, Page 273,  Art faculty  The primary movements in art which influenced education at Vkhutemas were constructivism and suprematism, although individuals were versatile enough to fit into many or no movements‚Äîoften teaching in multiple departments and working in diverse media. The leader figure of suprematist art, Kazimir Malevich, joined the teaching staff of Vkhutemas in 1925,Gilles N√©ret, Kazimir Malevich 1878‚Äì1935 and suprematism, Taschen, 2003, Page 93, however his group Unovis, of the Vitebsk art college that included El Lissitzky, exhibited at Vkhutemas as early as 1921.T. J. Clark, Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism, Yale University Press, 1999, Page 268, While constructivism was ostensibly developed as an art form in graphics and sculpture, it had architecture and construction as its underlying subject matter. This influence pervaded the school. The artistic education at Vkhutemas tended to be multidisciplinary, which stemmed from its origins as a merger of a fine arts college and a craft school. A further contributor to this was the generality of the basic course, which continued after students had specialised and was complemented by a versatile faculty. Vkhutemas cultivated polymath masters in the Renaissance mold, many with achievements in graphics, sculpture, product design, and architecture. –õ–µ–Ω–î–µ–∫–æ—Ä.–ò–Ω—Ñ–æ, –í–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ –ª–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ Painters and sculptors often made projects related to architecture; examples include Tatlin's Tower, Malevich's Architektons, and Rodchenko's Spatial Constructions. Artists moved from department to department, such as Rodchenko from painting to metalworking. Gustav Klutsis, who was head of a workshop on colour theory, also moved from painting and sculptural works to exhibition stands and kiosks.Margarita Tupitsyn, The Soviet Photograph, 1924‚Äì1937, Yale University Press, 1996, El Lissitzky, who had trained as an architect, also worked in a broad cross section of media such as graphics, print and exhibition design.Victor Margolin, The Struggle for Utopia: Rodchenko, Lissitzky, Moholy-Nagy, 1917‚Äì1946, University of Chicago Press, 1997, Pages 4‚Äì5,  Industrial faculty  The industrial faculties had the task of preparing artists of a new type, artists capable of working not only in the traditional pictorial and plastic arts but also capable of creating all objects in the human environment such as the articles of daily life, the implements of labor, etc. The industrial department at Vkhutemas endeavored to create products of viability in the economy and functionality found in society. Class-based political requirements steered artists toward crafts, and the designing of household or industrial goods. There was significant pressure in this respect by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, that in 1926, 1927, and 1928, required a student body composition \\"of worker and peasant origins\\", and several demands for \\"working class\\" elements.Catherine Cooke, Russian Avant-Garde: Theories of Art, Architecture, and the City, Academy Editions, 1995, (Cooke, 1995), pp.168,172‚Äì173. This push for design economy resulted in a tendency towards working, functional designs with minimised luxuries. Tables designed by Rodchenko were equipped with mechanical moving parts, and were standardised and multi-functional. The products designed at Vkhutemas never bridged the gap between workshops and factory production, although they cultivated a factory aesthetic‚ÄîPopova, Stepanova, and Tatlin even designed worker's industrial apparel.Lewis H. Siegelbaum, Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918‚Äì1929, Cambridge University Press, 1992, Page 114, Furniture pieces constructed at Vkhutemas explored the possibilities of new industrial materials such as plywood and tubular steel.Alan Colquhoun, Modern Architecture, Oxford University Press, 2002, Pages 110, 125‚Äì126, There were many successes for the departments, and they were to influence future design thinking. At the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, the Soviet pavilion by Konstantin Melnikov and its contents attracted both criticism and praise for its economic and working class architecture. One focus of criticism was the \\"nakedness\\" of the structure,Cooke, 1995, p.143. in comparison to other luxurious pavilions such as that by √âmile-Jacques Ruhlmann. Alexander Rodchenko designed a worker's club, Museum of Modern Art, Worker's Club 1925 accessed 1 August 2007. and the furniture that the Wood and Metal Working Faculty (–î–µ—Ä–º–µ—Ç—Ñ–∞–∫) contributed was an international success. The student work won several prizes, and Melnikov's pavilion won the Grand Prix. As a new generation of artist/designers, the students and faculty at Vkhutemas paved the way for designer furniture by architects such as Marcel Breuer, and Alvar Aalto later in the century. = Metalwork and woodwork = The dean of this department was Alexander Rodchenko, who was appointed in February 1922. Rodchenko's department was more expansive than its name would suggest, concentrating on abstract and concrete examples of product design. In a report to the rector of 1923, Rodchenko listed the following subjects as being offered: higher mathematics, descriptive geometry, theoretical mechanics, physics, the history of art and political literacy. Theoretical tasks included graphic design and \\"volumetric and spatial discipline\\"; while practical experience was given in foundry work, minting, engraving and electrotyping. Students were also given internships in factories. Rodchenko's approach effectively combined art and technology, and he was offered the deanship of Vkhutein in 1928, although he refused.Rodchenko, 2005, p.194. El Lissitzky was also a member of the faculty. = Textiles = The textile department was run by the constructivist designer Varvara Stepanova. In common with other departments, it was run on utilitarian lines, but Stepanova encouraged her students to take an interest in fashion: they were told to carry notebooks so that they could note the contemporary fabrics and aesthetics of everyday life as seen on the high street. Stepanova wrote in her 1925 course plan that this was done \\"with the goal of devising methods for a conscious awareness of the demands imposed on us by new social conditions\\".Christina Kiaer, Imagine no Possessions ‚Äì the Socialist Objects of Russian Constructivism, MIT Press, 2005, Page 122, Lyubov Popova was also a member of the textile faculty, and in 1922, when hired to design fabrics for the First State Textile Print Factory, Popova and Stepanova were among the first women designers in the Soviet textile industry.Abbott Gleason, Peter Kenez, Richard Stites, Bolshevik Culture: Experiment and Order in the Russian Revolution, Indiana University Press, 1985, Pages 209‚Äì210, Popova designed textiles both with asymmetrical architectonic geometries, and also work that was thematic. Before her death in 1924, Popova produced fabrics with grids of printed hammers and sickles, which would predate work by others in the political climate of the first five-year plan.Lesley Jackson, Twentieth- Century Pattern Design: Textile & Wallpaper Pioneers, Princeton Architectural Press, 2002, Page 55,  Lenin's visit  Vladimir Lenin signed a decree to create the school although its emphasis was on art rather than Marxism. Three months after its founding, on 25 February 1921, Lenin went to Vkhutemas to visit the daughter of Inessa Armand and to converse with the students, where in a discussion about art he found an affinity among them for Futurism. There he first viewed avant garde art, such as suprematist painting and he did not wholly approve of it, expressing concern over the connection between the student's art and politics. After the discussion, he was accepting and stated, \\"Well, tastes differ\\" and \\"I am an old man\\".Susan Buck-Morss, Dreamworld and Catastrophe: The Passing of Mass Utopia in East and West, MIT Press, 2002, Page 301, Although Lenin was not an enthusiast for avant garde art,Bernard Smith, Modernism's History: A Study in Twentieth-Century Art and Ideas, Yale University Press, 1998, Page 166, the Vkhutemas faculty and students made projects to honor him and further his politics. Ivan Leonidov's final project at Vkhutemas was his design for a Lenin Institute of Librarianship.Stephen Bann, The Tradition of Constructivism, Da Capo Press, 1990, Page xl, A model of Vladimir Tatlin's Monument to the Third International was built by students and displayed at their workshop in Saint Petersburg. Furthermore, Lenin's Mausoleum was designed by faculty member Aleksey Shchusev. Alexei Gan's book Constructivism, published in 1922, provided a theoretical link between the new emerging art and contemporary politics, connecting constructivism with the revolution, and Marxism.Cooke, 1995, p.89. The founding decree included a statement that students have an \\"obligatory education in political literacy and the fundamentals of the communist world view on all courses\\".Cooke, 1995, p.161. These examples help justify the school's projects in terms of the early political requirements but others would arise throughout the school's existence.  Comparisons with the Bauhaus  Vkhutemas was a close parallel to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture. Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus,Paul Wood, The Challenge of the Avant-Garde, Yale University Press, 1999, Page 244, but it was less publicised and consequently, is less familiar to the West.Tony Fry, Inc NetLibrary, A New Design Philosophy an Introduction to Defuturing, UNSW Press, 1999, Page 161, Vkhutemas's influence was expansive however‚Äîthe school exhibited two structures by faculty and award-winning student workPenelope Curtis, Sculpture 1900‚Äì1945: After Rodin, Oxford University Press, 1999, Page 188, at the 1925 Exposition in Paris. Furthermore, Vkhutemas attracted the interest and several visits from the director of the Museum of Modern Art, Alfred Barr. With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus.Timothy J. Colton, Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis, Harvard University Press, 1995, Page 215, The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, El Lissitzky's book Russia ‚Äì an Architecture for World Revolution published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects. Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period, and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes.  Vkhutein  As early as 1923, Rodchenko and others published a report in LEF which foretold of Vkhutemas's closure. It was in response to students' failure to gain a foothold in industry and was entitled, The Breakdown of VKhUTEMAS: Report on the Condition of the Higher Artistic and Technical Workshops, which stated that the school was \\"disconnected from the ideological and practical tasks of today\\". In 1927, the school's name was modified: \\"Institute\\" replaced \\"Studios\\" (–í—Ö—É—Ç–µ–∏–Ω, –í—ã—Å—à–∏–π —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç), or Vkhutein. Under this reorganisation, the 'artistic' content of the basic course was reduced to one term, when at one point it was two years. The school appointed a new rector, Pavel Novitsky, who took over from the painter Vladimir Favorsky in 1926.Cooke, 1995, p.173. It was under Novitsky's tenure that external political pressures increased, including the \\"working class\\" decree, and a series of external reviews by industry, and commercial organisations of student works' viability.Cooke, 1995, p.168. The school was dissolved in 1930, and was merged into various other programs. One such merger was with MVTU, forming the Architectural-Construction Institute, which became the Moscow Architectural Institute in 1933.Moscow Architectural Institute, History of the Institute accessed 2 August 2007. The Modernist movements which Vkhutemas had helped generate were critically considered as abstract formalism, M. Klyuev, –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–µ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏—è –¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω–∞., RosDesign. and were succeeded historically by socialist realism, postconstructivism, and the Empire style of Stalinist architecture.

It is related to immersion journalism, where a writer follows a subject or theme for a long period of time (weeks or months) and details an individual's experiences from a deeply personal perspective. History The first \\"non- fiction\\" novel was Operaci√≥n Masacre, completed in 1957 by the Argentinean Rodolfo Walsh. In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was the second, and the first English-language, book; it established itself as a historic example of narrative journalism in novel form. Published in 1965, it helped demonstrate to writers the possibility of using creative techniques while holding to the guidelines of journalism. Though Capote claims to have invented this new form of journalism, the origin of a movement of creative writing in journalism is often thought to have occurred much earlier. Characteristics of narrative journalism can be found in Daniel Defoe's writing in the 18th century, as well as in writings of Mark Twain in the 19th century and James Agee, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck in the World War II period. Capote's contemporary Tom Wolfe also wrote The New Journalism in 1974 and is credited for popularizing discussion on the appropriateness of narrative in journalism. He cites Gay Talese with being the \\"father\\" of new journalism, and exemplifies the foundations of narrative journalism in his compilation \\"The Gay Talese Reader\\". Today, many nonfiction novels use narrative journalism to tell their stories. Print publications such as Harper's, The New Yorker, Esquire, Rolling Stone, and The Village Voice are also welcome homes to narrative journalists. Mainstream newspaper publications are still wary of supporting narrative journalism too much due to time and space constraints, and will often print the occasional narrative in a Sunday features or supplemental magazine. The definitions of narrative journalism are many and varied. Some prefer to refer to it as literary journalism, or creative non-fiction. Simply put, narrative is the way in which a story is constructed through a particular point of view and arrangement of events. The Nieman Program on Narrative Journalism, launched in 2001, aims to provide a centre for the teaching, learning and practice of narrative journalism. The Nieman Foundation defines narrative journalism as more than simply telling stories: it is a complex genre with multiple layers and contexts that, when done well, has the capacity to reform newspapers and make them essential and compelling. Broadly, some critical elements of narrative journalism include the following: ‚Ä¢ It contains accurate, well-researched information, and is also interesting to read. ‚Ä¢ It looks at intriguing people, human emotions, and real situations. It provides the private story behind the public story. ‚Ä¢ It reaches past the ordinary by blending the reportage of facts with the writing style of fiction. Mark Kramer, former director of the Nieman Program on Narrative Journalism, says it is ‚Äújournalism that doesn‚Äôt assume the reader is a robot, that acknowledges the reader knows lots and feels and snickers and gets wild.‚Äù Kramer stresses the importance of voice. Readers have their coffee with the newspaper in the morning, he says. They want to understand and even identify with the news voice; but regular news reporting is anonymous and restrained, leaving the reader feeling lonely. When you have an audience made up of so many disparate sorts of people it seems noble to appeal to the lowest common denominator and just talk about the facts. But what happens is depersonalisation of the news voice ‚Äì narrative journalism aims to put the human voice back at the breakfast table. Kramer defines narrative journalism as writing that contains the following elements: 1\\\\. Set scenes; 2\\\\. Characters; 3\\\\. Action that unfolds over time; 4\\\\. Voice that has personality; 5\\\\. A relationship with the audience; and 6\\\\. Destination ‚Äì a theme, a purpose, and a reason. Online narrative journalism One of the earliest and most high-profile examples of effective usage of narrative journalism online can be found in the Philadelphia Inquirer's nonfiction serial \\"Black Hawk Down\\". The 1997 online newspaper series chronicled the dramatic American raid of Mogadishu and based their stories on interviews with the soldiers who fought in the battle. The story became part illustrated book, part documentary and part radio program and allowed readers to explore the story in depth. With the availability of free publishing online today, narrative journalism has become a popular form used by writers eager to give their personal perspectives on noteworthy events and public issues. Salon and Slate are two of the most popular forums for narrative journalism. Other sites devoted to this craft include Creative Nonfiction and Atlantic Unbound, and with the increasing popularity of citizen journalism there exists potential for more to explore on the scene to cater to a variety of niches. Six Billion, founded in 2003, was an online magazine of narrative journalism that attempted to tackle an issue from 360 degrees. Each issue (themed by one topic such as \\"Battleground States\\" or \\"Veterans of Foreign Wars\\") featured stories told in text, film/video, photography, sound, illustration, and interactive media. Issues with narrative journalism \\"A narrative does not depart from the cardinal rule: Make nothing up or you'll be out of here and working at the Sunglass Hut so fast it'll make your head spin around. A narrative is a journalistic form that has fallen into considerable disfavor in the wake of our craft's ceaseless, self-flagellating credibility crisis\\" ‚Äî Patrick Beach, Austin American-Statesman Since so much of narrative journalism is based on a writer reconstructing his or her experiences, many professionals in the news industry find themselves wary of using this technique because it is often harder to verify facts within the story. In a post-Jayson Blair era, those concerned with the ethics of honest reporting and writing are cautious of journalistic storytelling that may be manipulating facts to make the reader more emotionally invested. Also, narrative journalism has not yet found a definite home in the newsroom because of the nature of news reporting. Long-form journalism is something that most journalists are not trained for, and incredible hard-news beat reporters are not necessarily great storytellers. Narrative journalism cannot be practiced in every setting.

Written by Robert King, the film is about an American businessman who ends up wrongfully on trial for murder. His only hope of exoneration and freedom is a female defense lawyer from the country. The film received the 1997 National Board of Review Freedom of Expression Award (Richard Gere, Jon Avnet) and the NBR Award for Breakthrough Female Performance (Bai Ling). Ling also won the San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Actress. The film was censored in the People's Republic of China due to its unflattering portrayal of China's judicial system. Plot Wealthy American businessman Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is on a trip to China attempting to put together a satellite communications deal as part of a joint venture with the Chinese government. Before the deal can be finalized, Moore is framed for the murder of a powerful Chinese general's daughter, and the satellite contract is instead awarded to Moore's competitor, Gerhardt Hoffman (Ulrich Matschoss). Moore's court-appointed lawyer, Shen Yuelin (Bai Ling), initially does not believe his claims of innocence, but the pair gradually unearth evidence that not only vindicates Moore, but implicates powerful figures within the Chinese central government administration, exposing undeniable conspiracy and corruption. Shen manages to convince several high-ranking Chinese officials to release evidence that proves Moore's innocence. Moore is quickly released from prison while the conspirators responsible for framing him are arrested. At the airport, Moore asks Shen to leave China with him, but she decides to stay, as the case has opened her eyes to the injustices rife throughout China. She does admit, however, that meeting Moore has changed her life, and she now considers him a part of her family. They both share a heartfelt hug on the airport runway, before Moore departs for America.

In order to establish the film's verisimilitude, several Beijing actors were brought to the United States on visas for filming. The judicial and penitentiary scenes were recreated from descriptions given by attorneys and judges practicing in China and the video segment showing the execution of Chinese prisoners was an actual execution. The individuals providing the video and the descriptions to Avnet and his staff took a significant risk by providing it. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 30% based on reviews from 23 critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described Red Corner as \\"a contrived and cumbersome thriller designed to showcase Richard Gere's unhappiness with Red China, which it does with such thoroughness that story and characters are enveloped in the gloom. The Chinese do this better to themselves. Unlike such Chinese-made films as The Blue Kite, and To Live which criticize China with an insider's knowledge and detail, Red Corner plays like a xenophobic travelogue crossed with Perry Mason.\\" Cynthia Langston of Film Journal International responded to the film, \\"So unrealistic, so contrived and so blatantly 'Hollywood' that Gere can't possibly imagine he's opening any eyes to the problem, or any doors to its solution, for that matter.\\"Red Corner. Film Journal International. In his review in the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan called Red Corner a \\"sluggish and uninteresting melodrama that is further hampered by the delusion that it is saying something significant. But its one-man-against-the-system story is hackneyed and the points it thinks it's making about the state of justice in China are hampered by an attitude that verges on the xenophobic.\\" Salon film critic Andrew O'Hehir noted that the movie's subtext \\"swallows its story, until all that is left is Gere's superior virtue, intermixed with his superior virility‚Äîboth of which are greatly appreciated by the evidently underserviced Chinese female population.\\" O'Hehir also noted that the film reinforces the infamous Western stereotypes of Asian female sexuality (as in those of The World of Suzie Wong) as well as the hoariest stereotyping. Total Film gave a 3 out of 5 star rating, stating that Red Corner was \\"A semi-powerful thriller let down by pedestrian direction and a lacklustre Richard Gere. Even so, newcomer Bai Ling and an unblinking stare at the Draconian Chinese legal system prevent Red Corner from being an open-and-shut case\\" and describes some scenes depicting the harsh treatment of the Chinese legal system as \\"thought provoking\\" yet describes the rest as only \\"mildly entertaining\\".

It is the capital of Louetsi- Wano Department in Ngouni√© Province. It lies along the N6 road, 38.3 kilometres northeast of Ndend√©. A Catholic Mission has long been established in Lebamba. Geography Lebamba is located in south-western Gabon, and in the southeast of Ngouni√© Province. Kanda and Moukoundou lie nearby to the northeast. The Ngouni√© River flows just to the west of the town and the Louetsi River is also nearby. The land between Lebamba and Mouila is mainly floodplain. Two kilometres from Lebamba are \\"massive underground cave networks\\", known as the Bongolo Caves or Malib√© Caves. The caves lie at an altitude of 1150 metres. The Lekindou waterfall is also nearby. Economy An agronomical research center was established at Lebamba in the 1960s. Since, the Lebamba Agro-pastoral Project has conducted studies on the socio-economic aspects of livestock production in the region. In the 1970s, an oil mill for processing palm oil was established in Lebamba by the Agro-Gabon Company. In 1981, a two-year, UNDP funded project, Agro-pastoral Development of Lebamba Zone, was developed to study the socio-economic aspects of livestock production in the region. In the same decade, rice based farming systems were established in three villages of the Lebamba region. In 1990, it was noted that a soil conditioner project in Lebamba would continue for a few years as the country's soil has fairly low agricultural fertility. Culture The Nzebi people (or Banzebi, or Ndzebi)) live in the area between Lebamba and extending to west of Franceville. Njebi, a Northwest Bantu language, is spoken in Lebamba. The Wumbvu people live in the same province, but to the east of Lebamba; they speak the Wumbvu language and are of a different tribal cluster, that of the Central Congo. It was reported in 1971 that the Christian and Missionary Alliance opened a bookstore, reading room and youth center in the village. The Bongolo Hospital, which is considered to be one of the best in Gabon, is located in Lebamba. Established in 1977, the hospital is staffed by American missionary doctors and is one of only three hospitals in Gabon that offers HIV testing (the others are the Libreville and Port Gentil Hospitals). Transportation In 1993, a bridge financed by the US, Canada and France was announced costing CFA69.280m for construction over the Louetsi River near Lebamba; the total cost of the scheme was estimated at CFA281.745m. The Ndende to Lebamba road was constructed with the assistance of China. An laterite and grass airstrip services the hospital.

It is then said to be of type or order m. We give the combinatorial definition of finite type invariant due to Goussarov, and (independently) Joan Birman and Xiao-Song Lin. Let V be a knot invariant. Define V1 to be defined on a knot with one transverse singularity. Consider a knot K to be a smooth embedding of a circle into \\\\R^3. Let K' be a smooth immersion of a circle into \\\\mathbb R^3 with one transverse double point. Then : V^1(K') = V(K_+) - V(K_-), where K_+ is obtained from K by resolving the double point by pushing up one strand above the other, and K_- is obtained similarly by pushing the opposite strand above the other. We can do this for maps with two transverse double points, three transverse double points, etc., by using the above relation. For V to be of finite type means precisely that there must be a positive integer m such that V vanishes on maps with m+1 transverse double points. Furthermore, note that there is notion of equivalence of knots with singularities being transverse double points and V should respect this equivalence. There is also a notion of finite type invariant for 3-manifolds. Examples The simplest nontrivial Vassiliev invariant of knots is given by the coefficient of the quadratic term of the Alexander‚ÄìConway polynomial. It is an invariant of order two. Modulo two, it is equal to the Arf invariant. Any coefficient of the Kontsevich invariant is a finite type invariant. The Milnor invariants are finite type invariants of string links. Invariants representation Michael Polyak and Oleg Viro gave a description of the first nontrivial invariants of orders 2 and 3 by means of Gauss diagram representations. Mikhail N. Goussarov has proved that all Vassiliev invariants can be represented that way. The universal Vassiliev invariant In 1993, Maxim Kontsevich proved the following important theorem about Vassiliev invariants: For every knot one can compute an integral, now called the Kontsevich integral, which is a universal Vassiliev invariant, meaning that every Vassiliev invariant can be obtained from it by an appropriate evaluation. It is not known at present whether the Kontsevich integral, or the totality of Vassiliev invariants, is a complete knot invariant. Computation of the Kontsevich integral, which has values in an algebra of chord diagrams, turns out to be rather difficult and has been done only for a few classes of knots up to now. There is no finite-type invariant of degree less than 11 which distinguishes mutant knots. See also *Willerton's fish References Further reading *Victor A. Vassiliev, Cohomology of knot spaces.

Biography Ivanov was born in what is now Northern Kazakhstan to a teacher's family. When he was a child, Vsevolod ran away to become a clown in a travelling circus. His first story, published in 1915, caught the attention of Maxim Gorky, who advised Vsevolod throughout his career. Ivanov joined the Red Army during the Civil War and fought in Siberia. This inspired his short stories, Partisans (1921) and Armoured Train (1922). In 1922 Ivanov joined the literary group Serapion Brothers. Other members included Nikolai Tikhonov, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Victor Shklovsky, Veniamin Kaverin and Konstantin Fedin. Ivanov's first novels, Colored Winds (1922) and Azure Sands (1923), were set in Asiatic part of Russia and gave rise to the genre of ostern in Soviet literature. His novella Baby was acclaimed by Edmund Wilson as the finest Soviet short story ever. Later, Ivanov came under fire from Bolshevik critics who claimed his works were too pessimistic and that it was not clear whether the Reds or Whites were the heroes. In 1927 Ivanov rewrote his short story, the Armoured Train 14-69 into a play. This time, the play highlighted the role of the Bolsheviks in the Civil War. Among his later works are the Adventures of a Fakir (1935) and The Taking of Berlin (1945). During the Second World War, Ivanov worked as a war correspondent for Izvestia. Vsevolod's son Vyacheslav Ivanov became one of the leading philologists and Indo-Europeanists of the late 20th century. Vsevolod adopted Isaak Babel's illegitimate child Emmanuil when he married Babel's one-time mistress Tamara Kashirina. Emmanuil's name was changed to \\"Mikhail Ivanov\\" and he later became a noted artist.

CHEEK-a-mus) is a tributary of the Squamish River, beginning on the west slopes of Outlier Peak in Garibaldi Provincial Park upstream from Cheakamus Lake on the southeastern outskirts of the resort area of Whistler. The river flows into Cheakamus Lake before exiting it and flowing northwest until it turns south and enters Daisy Lake. Between the outlet of Daisy Lake and its mouth, much of its length is spent going through Cheakamus Canyon, where the river flows through swift rapids and even one good sized waterfall. The river flows south from the lake and through the canyon before joining the Squamish River at Cheekye, a few miles north of the town of Squamish. The river's name is an anglicization of the name of Chiyakmesh (\\"people of the fish weir\\"), a village of the Squamish people and a reserve of the Squamish Nation. The c. 70 km (c.44 mi) length of the Cheakamus is followed by British Columbia Highway 99 (the Sea-to-Sky Highway) and the British Columbia Railway. The Cheakamus is a whitewater rafting and kayaking route, and is known for its steelhead and salmon fishing. Much of the flow of the upper Cheakamus is diverted from Daisy Lake beneath the mountains to the west to the Cheakamus Powerhouse on the Squamish River. Notable just north of Daisy Lake is Brandywine Falls. The Nordic events complex of the 2010 Winter Olympics was located on Callaghan Creek, a tributary of the Cheakamus just upstream from Brandywine Creek.

The preganglionic parasympathetic axons of this nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion. Structure Preganglionic parasympathetic fibres arise in the superior salivary nucleus of the pontine tegmentum. They join with general somatic sensory and special sensory fibres to form the nervus intermedius. The nervus intermedius exits the cranial cavity at the Internal auditory meatus, and joins with the motor root of the facial nerve at the geniculate ganglion. While preganglionic parasympathetic fibres pass through the geniculate ganglion, they neither synapse, nor have their cell bodies located there. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibres exit the geniculate ganglion as the greater petrosal nerve. It enters the middle cranial fossa through the hiatus of the facial canal, along with the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery. It enters the pterygoid canal, where it joins the deep petrosal nerve (a sympathetic nerve) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal, which passes through the pterygoid canal to reach the pterygopalatine ganglion. Function The greater petrosal nerve carries parasympathetic preganglionic fibers from the facial nerve. The greater petrosal nerve joins with the deep petrosal nerve (postganglionic sympathetic axons from the internal carotid plexus) and continues as the nerve of the pterygoid canal and ultimately synapses with the pterygopalatine ganglion whose parasympathetic postganglionic fibers synapse with the lacrimal gland and the mucosal glands lining the nasal cavity and palate.

Deth has published scientific studies on the role of D4 dopamine receptors in psychiatric disorders, as well as the book, Molecular Origins of Human Attention: The Dopamine-Folate Connection. He has also become a prominent voice in the controversies in autism and thiomersal and vaccines, due to his hypothesis that certain children are more at risk than others because they lack the normal ability to excrete neurotoxic metals. Education Deth attended State University of New York at Buffalo, where he graduated in 1970 with a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. In 1975, Deth obtained his PhD from the University of Miami with a thesis entitled \\"The relative contribution of Ca++ influx and intracellular Ca++ release in the drug induced contraction of the rabbit aorta.\\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/relative-contribution-of-ca- influx-and-intracellular-ca-release-in-the-drug-induced-contraction-of-the- rabbit-aorta/oclc/1675020&referer;=brief_results Research focus The primary realm of research conducted by Deth involves the role of D4 dopamine receptors in schizophrenia and attention. He has focused on understanding the molecular basis of transmembrane signaling by G protein-coupled receptors, the study of their structure using three-dimensional molecular graphics, and modeling how the binding of various drugs causes a shift in their molecular form.Zhu Q., Qi, L-J., Abou-Samra, A., Shi, A. and Deth, R.C.: \\"Protein kinase C-dependent constitutive activity of a2A/D-adrenergic receptors.\\" Pharmacol. 71: 80-90 (2004). Deth has characterized the conformation-dependent participation of D4 dopamine receptors in the process of phospholipid methylation, and found that different states of methylation yield varying degrees of spontaneous activity of G protein coupling. He has theorized that these processes are involved in the neural mechanisms of attention.Deth, R.C. \\"Molecular Origins of Attention: The Dopamine-Folate Connection\\" Kluwer Academic Publishers (2003). Deth has found that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and dopamine both stimulated folate-dependent methylation pathways in neuronal cells, while compounds like ethanol, the vaccine preservative thimerosal, and metals (like mercury, which is contained in thimerosal, and lead) inhibited these same biochemical pathways at low concentrations resembling those found following vaccination or other sources of exposure. An enzyme mediating methylation, methionine synthase, uses an active form of vitamin B12 to complete its chemical function. Thimerosal interferes with the conversion of dietary forms of B12 into the active form and so impedes DNA methylation and disrupts mercury detoxification and some normal gene actions.Waly, M., Banerjee, R., Choi, S.W., Mason, J., Benzecry, J., Power- Charnitsky, V.A, Deth, R.C. \\"PI3-kinase regulates methionine synthase: Activation by IGF-1 or dopamine and inhibition by heavy metals and thimerosal\\" Molecular Psychiatry 9: 358-370 (2004). Based on this research, Deth has theorized that thimerosal in vaccines could give rise to autism in a subset of children who are genetically vulnerable; he has also contended that the body's response to thimerosal is a hormetic one, in which low-level exposure to the substance causes a beneficial effect.Thimerosal, Autism and Hormesis He played an active role in the initial confusion about the suggested relationship thiomersal and vaccines, testifying twice to Congress about his views. Deth's hypothesis is, however, contradicted by much of the current literature about the causes of autism, which indicates that the levels of thimerosal found in vaccines and other sources cannot be directly implicated as a cause.Doja A, Roberts W (2006). \\"Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature\\". Can J Neurol Sci 33 (4): 341‚Äì6.Taylor B (2006). \\"Vaccines and the changing epidemiology of autism\\". Child Care Health Dev 32 (5): 511‚Äì9. This aspect of his research attracted such controversy that a dean at Northeastern University once wrote a letter to Deth telling him to stop.

The dough used is either Italian bread dough or pizza dough. Stromboli was invented by Italian- Americans in the United States in Philadelphia. A stromboli is somewhat similar to a calzone. A calzone is a baked turnover stuffed with pizza ingredients. A stromboli is usually made by rolling up dough with cheese and meat ingredients and is then baked, but it does not generally contain pizza ingredients aside from Italian cheese and Italian meats. Generally, strombolis do not usually contain tomato sauce, unlike calzones. A calzone is crescent- shaped, and a stromboli is usually shaped like a long cylinder. The distinction between the two is complicated because there is some variation in what constitutes a stromboli.Shuster, Jim (May 10, 2012). \\"The Stromboli vs. the Calzone\\", Gilroy Patch. Retrieved August 14, 2016. Preparation Many American pizza shops serve a stromboli using pizza dough that is folded in half with fillings, similar to a half-moon-shaped calzone. At other establishments, a stromboli is made with a square-shaped pizza dough that can be topped with any pizza toppings and is then rolled into a cylindrical jelly roll shape and baked. Other variations include adding pizza sauce or deep- frying, similar to panzerotti. Origins There are several claims regarding the origin of the usage of the name stromboli for food in the United States. Romano's Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria claims to have first used the name in 1950 in Essington, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, courtesy of Nazzareno Romano. The pizzeria owner had experimented with pizza imbottita, or \\"stuffed pizza\\", and added ham, cotechino sausage, cheese and peppers into a pocket of bread dough. His future brother-in-law suggested he name it after the recently released movie Stromboli, notorious for an off-screen affair between married actress, Ingrid Bergman, and married director, Roberto Rossellini, resulting in a love child. In 1954, Mike Aquino of Mike's Burger Royal in Spokane, Washington, says he also named a turnover after the same movie. However, Aquino's version appears to only share the same name as the commonly accepted version of the stromboli and is significantly different from the Philadelphia turnover version that is usually defined as a \\"stromboli\\". Aquino's \\"stromboli\\" consists of capicola ham and provolone cheese covered in an Italian chili sauce on a French bread roll. Variations also exist in Indiana.

It is easy to get lost in the narrow passageways of the market and there are pickpockets, so visitors should keep track of their money and valuables at all times. On the outskirts of the market is a large shopping district. Many of the shops carry a wide variety of the popular print fabrics used to make clothing. Above many of the shops, local women run restaurants out of their apartments. Good Middle Eastern and north African food may be had at reasonable prices. Children wander the market, selling plastic bags for holding goods, bags of drinking water, bean sandwiches and other items for shoppers. Next to the market is the old location of the gare routier, or major bush taxi stop. Due to a high incidence of violence and robbery, the main gare is now closed. Bush taxis must now be obtained on the outskirts of Libreville along the main highways, particularly at PK8 (Point Kilometer 8) along the N1 road. Across from the market is a prison.

Biography Pyotr Yershov was born in the village of Bezrukovo, Tobolsk Governorate (currently Ishimsky District, Tyumen Oblast). During his childhood he lived in the town of Beryozov. From 1827 to 1831, he studied in Tobolsk gymnasium, where he reportedly created a society for the Ethnographic study of Siberia and even planned to publish their own scientific journal. From 1831 to 1836, Yershov studied philosophy at Saint Petersburg University, which was where, at the age of 19, he wrote his masterpiece, the fairy-tale poem The Little Humpbacked Horse. A large extract from it was published in 1834 and brought Yershov instant fame. Alexander Pushkin wrote that Yershov was as fully in command of his verses as a landowner is in command of his serfs. Pushkin also announced that he would stop writing fairy tales as Yershov did it much better. Nonetheless, Pushkin did write The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish one year after this announcement. In 1836, Yershov returned to Tobolsk, where he worked as a teacher at the Tobolsk gymnasium. He became the principal of the school in 1858. Yershov published many lyrical verses, a drama called Suvorov and a Station Master, and several short stories, but none of these had the same success as The Humpbacked Horse. He also reportedly wrote a large fairy-tale poem called Ilya Muromets, and a huge poem called Ivan Tsarevitch in ten volumes and one hundred songs, but subsequently destroyed them. Only a short extract from Ivan Tsarevitch survived. Yershov died in 1869 in Tobolsk. His biographers note that disasters frequented his life. In 1834, just after the triumph of The Humpbacked Horse, both Pyotr's father and brother died within a few days. In 1838, his mother died; in 1845, his wife died; in 1847, he married again, but his second wife died in 1852. Of his 15 children only six survived. The Humpbacked Horse animated film. The Humpbacked Horse (Konyok-Gorbunok), sometimes known in English as The Magic Horse or The Little Magic Horse, is a version of the Golden-Maned Steed fairy-tale character type, although a large part of the plot of this story is based on Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf. The titular little horse helps Ivan, a peasant's son, carry out the many unreasonable demands of the Tsar. During his adventures, Ivan captures the beautiful magic firebird for the tsar, keeps his magic horse, and finds his love, Tsar-Maid (Princess). At the end, the princess and the peasant's son live happily for many years after. Censors banned the complete story for over 20 years in the mid-19th century because it made the Tsar appear foolish. Until 1856, the tale was published with dots representing omitted verses and songs in many sections. The tale is meant to be a satire on the absurdities of Russian feudal and bureaucratic life at the time. The poem became very popular in Soviet Russia and there are numerous editions and adaptations. Today it is considered a classic children's fairy tale. Derived works include a 1941 film adaptation by Alexander Rou (1941), an animated film by Ivan Ivanov-Vano (1947/1975), a ballet by Rodion Shchedrin (1955), and a musical composition by E. Voegelin (2007). An English translation by Louis Zellikoff was published in 1957.Pyotr Yershov. The little humpbacked horse, Translated from the Russian by Louis Zellikoff Illustrated by N.M.

He holds a dual citizenship of Russia and Estonia. Veller was born in Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union (modern day Ukraine) in 1948. In 1972 he graduated with a degree in linguistics from Leningrad University. He worked as a children's summer camp counselor, a hunter in Taimyr, a shepherd in the Altai mountains, a logger, a journalist, a teacher, and more - around 30 professions in all. Veller's first book, a collection of short stories titled I Want To Be A Yard-Sweeper, was published in Estonia in 1983, followed by Heart Breaker (1988), Technology of a Short Story (1989), and Rendezvous with a Celebrity (1990). A Novel of Upbringing and Adventures of Major Zvyagin (1991) became bestsellers, along with \\"The Legends of Nevsky Prospect\\" (1993). His book Everything about Life is a book about how the world works, why a no one ever has what they need, and why happiness is not achievable but should be sought (his later book Cassandra updates this philosophy).

In Everything about Life Veller repeated Ernest Hemingway's words: \\"There are people who want to know everything and those who are sick of what they already know. The latter say nothing to prevent things from turning for the worse, while the former interfere in all, hoping to make things better\\" (paraphrased). Veller proclaims himself to be with the former kind. Veller nurtures his world-view to the point that he publishes volumes with philosophical inclination. He invented energoevolutionism. According to this theory the primordial energy released in the Big Bang is attached to material structures of ever increasing complexity, which in their turn decompose and release energy. These cycles continue at ever increasing speed. The human existence is entangled in this process and also increases the speed of revolution. Humankind thus is at the cutting edge of the evolution of the universe. The end of history is to arrive when post-humanity will assist the release of all energy in the matter, thereby causing a new cycle by the next BIg Bang event. Within the concept of energoevolution Veller addresses also aesthetics, sociology and psychology.Tetralogy: –≠–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–æ—ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏–∑–º (2011) * –ü—Å–∏—Ö–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–æ—ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞ (2011) * –°–æ—Ü–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–æ—ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞ (2011) * –≠—Å—Ç–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∞ —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–æ—ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞ (2011) Veller's philosophical essays achieved some attention in Russia and abroad, but also met with severe criticism from professional philosophers.–î—É–±—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, –î–∞–≤–∏–¥ –ò–∑—Ä–∞–∏–ª–µ–≤–∏—á. ¬´–°–∞–º–æ–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ¬ª —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—ã –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞—é—Ç! :ru:–î—É–±—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, –î–∞–≤–∏–¥ –ò–∑—Ä–∞–∏–ª–µ–≤–∏—á. ¬´–°–∞–º–æ–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ¬ª —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—ã –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞—é—Ç! // –í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –†–§–û, ‚Ññ3, 2008 –≥–æ–¥.

He is a professor with the College of Social Sciences and International Studies at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, director of the university's European Centre for Palestine Studies, and co- director of the Exeter Centre for Ethno-Political Studies. Papp√© was born in Haifa, Israel. Prior to coming to the UK, he was a senior lecturer in political science at the University of Haifa (1984‚Äì2007) and chair of the Emil Touma Institute for Palestinian and Israeli Studies in Haifa (2000‚Äì2008). He is the author of The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine (2006), The Modern Middle East (2005), A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples (2003), and Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (1988). He was also a leading member of Hadash, and was a candidate on the party list in the 1996 and 1999 Knesset elections. Papp√© is one of Israel's New Historians who, since the release of pertinent British and Israeli government documents in the early 1980s, have been rewriting the history of Israel's creation in 1948, and the corresponding expulsion or flight of 700,000 Palestinians in the same year. He has written that the expulsions were not decided on an ad hoc basis, as other historians have argued, but constituted the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, in accordance with Plan Dalet, drawn up in 1947 by Israel's future leaders. He blames the creation of Israel for the lack of peace in the Middle East, arguing that Zionism is more dangerous than Islamic militancy, and has called for an international boycott of Israeli academics. Papp√© supports the one-state solution, which envisages a binational state for Palestinians and Israelis.. His work has been both supported and criticized by other historians. Before he left Israel in 2008, he had been condemned in the Knesset, Israel's parliament; a minister of education had called for him to be sacked; his photograph had appeared in a newspaper at the centre of a target; and he had received several death threats. Early life and education Papp√© was born in Haifa, Israel, to German Jewish parents who fled Nazi persecution in the 1930s. At the age of 18, he was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces, serving in the Golan Heights during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1978, and in 1984 obtained his PhD in history from the University of Oxford, under the guidance of Albert Hourani and Roger Owen. His doctoral thesis became his first book, Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict. Academic career Papp√© in a lecture in the Manchester Metropolitan University in 2008 Papp√© was a senior lecturer at the Middle Eastern History Department and the Political Science Department of the University of Haifa between 1984 and 2006. He was the Academic Director of the Research Institute for Peace at Givat Haviva from 1993 to 2000, and chair of the Emil Touma Institute for Palestinian Studies. Papp√© left Israel in 2007 to take up his appointment in Exeter, after his endorsement of the boycott of Israeli universities led the president of the University of Haifa to call for his resignation. Papp√© said that he found it \\"increasingly difficult to live in Israel\\" with his \\"unwelcome views and convictions.\\" In a Qatari newspaper interview explaining his decision, he said: \\"I was boycotted in my university and there had been attempts to expel me from my job. I am getting threatening calls from people every day. I am not being viewed as a threat to the Israeli society but my people think that I am either insane or my views are irrelevant. Many Israelis also believe that I am working as a mercenary for the Arabs.\\" =Katz controversy= Papp√© publicly supported an M.A. thesis by Haifa University student Teddy Katz, which was approved with highest honors, that claimed Israel had committed a massacre in the Palestinian village of Tantura during the war in 1948, based upon interviews with Arab residents of the village and with an Israeli veteran of the operation. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian historians had previously recorded any such incident, which Meyrav Wurmser described as a \\"made-up massacre\\", but, according to Papp√©, \\"the story of Tantura had already been told before, as early as 1950... It appears in the memoirs of a Haifa notable, Muhammad Nimr al-Khatib, who, a few days after the battle, recorded the testimony of a Palestinian.\\"The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, p. 137. In December 2000, Katz was sued for libel by veterans of the Alexandroni Brigade and after the testimony was heard, he retracted his allegations about the massacre. Twelve hours later, he retracted his retraction. During the trial, lawyers for the veterans pointed to what they said were discrepancies between the taped interviews Katz conducted and descriptions in Katz's thesis. Katz revised his thesis, and, following the trial, the university appointed a committee to examine it. After reviewing the taped interviews and finding discrepancies between them and what was written in the thesis, Katz was allowed to submit a revised thesis. According to Counterpunch, the assessment of the revised thesis was highly mixed, but overall it failed. Papp√© continues to defend both Katz and his thesis. Tom Segev and others argued that there is merit or some truth in what Katz described. According to the Israeli New Historian Benny Morris: \\"There is no unequivocal proof of a large-scale massacre at Tantura, but war crimes were perpetrated there.\\" Political activism In 1999, Papp√© ran in the Knesset elections as seventh on the Communist Party-led Hadash list. (Papp√© is No. 7) After years of political activism, Papp√© supports economic and political boycotts of Israel, including an academic boycott. He believes boycotts are justified because \\"the Israeli occupation is a dynamic process and it becomes worse with each passing day. The AUT can choose to stand by and do nothing, or to be part of a historical movement similar to the anti-apartheid campaign against the white supremacist regime in South Africa. By choosing the latter, it can move us forward along the only remaining viable and non-violent road to saving both Palestinians and Israelis from an impending catastrophe.\\" As a result, then University of Haifa President Aaron Ben-Ze'ev called on Papp√© to resign, saying: \\"it is fitting for someone who calls for a boycott of his university to apply the boycott himself.\\" He said that Papp√© would not be ostracized, since that would undermine academic freedom, but he should leave voluntarily. In the same year, Papp√© initiated the annual Israeli Right of return conferences, which called for the unconditional right of return of the Palestinian refugees who were expelled in 1948. In August 2015, Papp√© was a signatory to a letter criticising The Jewish Chronicles reporting of Jeremy Corbyn's association with alleged antisemites. Critical assessment Israeli scholar Emmanuel Sivan, reviewing Papp√©'s 2003 political biography of the al- Husayni family, praised the book's treatment of the development of Palestinian nationalism and that of Haj Amin's exile in Germany, but criticised the view taken on the mufti's visit to the German consul and the scant attention given to Faisal Husseini. Those critical of his work include Benny Morris (who described some of Pappe's writing as \\"complete fabrication\\" and said he was \\"at best...one of the world's sloppiest historians; at worst, one of the most dishonest\\"), Efraim Karsh, and Herbert London as well as professors Daniel GutweinGutwein (2011). \\"Left and Right Post-Zionism\\", p. 100. and Yossi Ben- Artzi from Haifa University.

Biography Nekrasov was born in Kyiv and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1936. Between 1937 and 1941, he was an actor and set designer with the . During World War II, he served in the Red Army (1941‚Äì1944) and fought in the Battle of Stalingrad. After the war he became a journalist and based his first book Front-line Stalingrad (V okopakh Stalingrada, literal translation In the trenches of Stalingrad, 1946) on his experiences there. The novel was awarded the USSR State Prize for literature in 1947. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, Nekrasov took advantage of the first wave of destalinization to publish In the Home Town (1954), a novel which marked a departure from the Stalin-era socialist realism in Soviet literature. His later works, especially his novel Kira Georgievna (1961), are markedly anti-Stalinist. In 1959 he was the first Soviet writer to openly call for a monument to be built at Baby Yar. A travelogue of his experiences in Italy in 1957 and the United States in 1960, Both Sides of the Ocean, which was unusually open for its time, was published in 1962 and denounced by Nikita Khrushchev in 1963. After Khruschev's ouster in October 1964, Nekrasov joined other Soviet intellectuals in protesting what he saw as the new government's gradual restoration of Stalinism. He signed numerous open letters protesting government policies in 1966-1973 and was expelled from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1973. In 1974 he emigrated to France, where he became an associate editor of the emigre magazine Kontinent. While in exile, he wrote an autobiography, Newspaper of a Peculiar One (1976), and a novel, Those of the Front (1978). In 1979, after he had made some ironic marks on Brezhnev's trilogy, Nekrasov's Soviet citizenship was revoked.(in Russian) He died in Paris and was buried in Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery, in the southern suburbs of Paris.

A motion detector is an electrical device that utilizes a sensor to detect nearby motion. Such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. They form a vital component of security, automated lighting control, home control, energy efficiency, and other useful systems. Overview An active electronic motion detector contains an optical, microwave, or acoustic sensor, as well as a transmitter. However, a passive contains only a sensor and only senses a signature from the moving object via emission or reflection. Changes in the optical, microwave or acoustic field in the device's proximity are interpreted by the electronics based on one of several technologies. Most low-cost motion detectors can detect motion at distances of about . Specialized systems are more expensive but have either increased sensitivity or much longer ranges. Tomographic motion detection systems can cover much larger areas because the radio waves it senses are at frequencies which penetrate most walls and obstructions, and are detected in multiple locations. Motion detectors have found wide use in commercial applications. One common application is activating automatic door openers in businesses and public buildings. Motion sensors are also widely used in lieu of a true occupancy sensor in activating street lights or indoor lights in walkways, such as lobbies and staircases. In such smart lighting systems, energy is conserved by only powering the lights for the duration of a timer, after which the person has presumably left the area. A motion detector may be among the sensors of a burglar alarm that is used to alert the home owner or security service when it detects the motion of a possible intruder. Such a detector may also trigger a security camera to record the possible intrusion. Sensor technology A passive infrared detector mounted on circuit board (right), along with photoresistive detector for visible light (left). This is the type most commonly encountered in household motion sensing devices and is designed to turn on a light only when motion is detected and when the surrounding environment is sufficiently dark. Several types of motion detection are in wide use: = Passive infrared (PIR) = Passive infrared (PIR) sensors are sensitive to a person's skin temperature through emitted black-body radiation at mid-infrared wavelengths, in contrast to background objects at room temperature. No energy is emitted from the sensor, thus the name passive infrared.Ultrasonicand Passive Infrared SensorIntegrationfor Dual TechnologyUser Detection Sensors This distinguishes it from the electric eye for instance (not usually considered a motion detector), in which the crossing of a person or vehicle interrupts a visible or infrared beam. These devices can detect objects, people, or animals by picking up one's infrared radiation. = Microwave = These detect motion through the principle of Doppler radar, and are similar to a radar speed gun. A continuous wave of microwave radiation is emitted, and phase shifts in the reflected microwaves due to motion of an object toward (or away from) the receiver result in a heterodyne signal at a low audio frequency. = Ultrasonic = An ultrasonic transducer emits an ultrasonic wave (sound at a frequency higher than a human ear can hear) and receives reflections from nearby objects. Exactly as in Doppler radar, heterodyne detection of the received field indicates motion. The detected doppler shift is also at low audio frequencies (for walking speeds) since the ultrasonic wavelength of around a centimeter is similar to the wavelengths used in microwave motion detectors. One potential drawback of ultrasonic sensors is that the sensor can be sensitive to motion in areas where coverage is undesired, for instance, due to reflections of sound waves around corners. Such extended coverage may be desirable for lighting control, where the goal is the detection of any occupancy in an area. But for opening an automatic door, for example, a sensor selective to traffic in the path toward the door is superior. = Tomographic motion detector = These systems sense disturbances to radio waves as they pass from node to node of a mesh network. They have the ability to detect over large areas completely because they can sense through walls and other obstructions. = Video camera software = With the proliferation of low-cost digital cameras able to shoot video, it is possible to use the output of such a camera to detect motion in its field of view using software. This solution is particularly attractive when the intent is to record video triggered by motion detection, as no hardware beyond the camera and computer is needed. Since the observed field may be normally illuminated, this may be considered another passive technology. However it can also be used together with near- infrared illumination to detect motion in the dark, that is, with the illumination at a wavelength undetectable by a human eye. = Gesture detector = Photodetectors and infrared lighting elements can support digital screens to detect hand motions and gestures with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Dual-technology motion detectors Many modern motion detectors use combinations of different technologies. While combining multiple sensing technologies into one detector can help reduce false triggering, it does so at the expense of reduced detection probabilities and increased vulnerability. For example, many dual-tech sensors combine both a PIR sensor and a microwave sensor into one unit. For motion to be detected, both sensors must trip together. This lowers the probability of a false alarm since heat and light changes may trip the PIR but not the microwave, or moving tree branches may trigger the microwave but not the PIR. If an intruder is able to fool either the PIR or microwave, however, the sensor will not detect it. Often, PIR technology is paired with another model to maximize accuracy and reduce energy use. PIR draws less energy than emissive microwave detection, and so many sensors are calibrated so that when the PIR sensor is tripped, it activates a microwave sensor. If the latter also picks up an intruder, then the alarm is sounded.

Drecker's father Peter, a German from Bielefeld, emigrated in 1960 to Norway. In the fall of 2006 Bel Canto celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the first album with several concerts. She has released three solo albums, and has provided vocals for various artists including Motorpsycho, Jan Bang, Savoy, a-ha, R√∂yksopp, Jah Wobble, Ketil Bj√∏rnstad, Simon Raymonde, Mental Overdrive, Illumination and Hector Zazou. Drecker contributed as composer and singer in a production of P√§r Lagerkvist's B√∏ddelen at Det Norske Teatret (2000), and has worked as a freelance actress and composer at H√•logaland Teater from 2009 to 2015. She worked with fellow Norwegians R√∂yksopp, since 1999-2012 including as the vocalist on the track \\"Sparks\\" and as their live vocalist (as heard on their live album Royksopp's Night Out), on three songs on their album Junior. Additionally, she appeared with countrymen a-ha on their Minor Earth, Major Sky Tour and appeared on the live DVD Live from Vallhall and the following album from their European Tour, How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head.. In 2004 she was a jury member in the Norwegian version of Pop Idol. She continues to occasionally perform live in Norway. In 2012 Drecker took part in the NRK TV-show Stjernekamp, first season. In 2014 she appeared again on TV2 as one of the artists in the famous series \\"Hver Gang Vi M√∏tes\\". On her latest album Rocks And Straws (2015) we are given the home reversion of a journey that began in 1986 with Bel Canto. During the journey, it became increasingly clearer to Drecker where she comes from, and the music she creates is the result of this Nordic arctic acoustic landscape, with influences of music from all around the world. She has composed the music with lyrics based on poems by the Northern Norwegian poet Arvid Hanssen.

The erection of the memorial on the High Street began in November 1920. It is built of Hollington stone from Staffordshire, and stands high. The work was carried out by R. I. Boulton and Sons of Cheltenham to Guy Dawber's design. Carved at the top of the memorial are the figures of St. George and the Dragon from the model prepared by the sculptor, Allan Wyon of London. The total cost was around ¬£700, raised primarily from public subscriptions. The memorial consists of an octagonal flight of five steps, upon which stands a sur-base containing panels and surmounted around the top by the inscription \\"In grateful memory of the men of Moreton and Batsford who gave their lives in the Great War\\". On four panels are inscribed the names of the forty-four men who died. On a fifth panel was later inscribed \\"These men also gave their lives 1939-1945\\" with the names of seven men who fell in the Second World War. On the sur-base is superimposed another base block with cusped and traceried panels containing the arms of the County of Gloucestershire and of St. George emblazoned in colour and gilt. Above this rises an octagonal shaft crowned by the carved figure of St. George and the Dragon. The unveiling took place on the afternoon of Saturday 26 March 1921, when there was a large crowd from Moreton and the surrounding villages. Over seventy of the local branch of the Comrades of the Great War paraded under Captain Henderson, as did the Girl Guides under Miss D. Southorn, the Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster Haines, and nurses from the VAD Hospital at Kitebrook under their Commandant, Mrs Pritchard OBE. Sir Gilbert Wills of Batsford Park gave a brief address before the monument was formally unveiled by Lord Redesdale. In 2001, a further \\"peacetime\\" casualty was added to the memorial. In 2018 the name of a female SOE agent killed in a concentration camp in 1944 was added.

Winter constellations as seen from the tropics Flip book (158 images): Transit of Mars, Sun, Mercury, and Venus in 2017 The Winter Hexagon or Winter Circle/Oval is an asterism appearing to be in the form of a hexagon with vertices at Rigel, Aldebaran, Capella, Pollux, Procyon, and Sirius. It is mostly upon the Northern Hemisphere's celestial sphere. On most locations on Earth (except the South Island of New Zealand and the south of Chile and Argentina and further south), this asterism is prominently in the sky from approximately December to March. In the tropics and southern hemisphere, this (then called \\"summer hexagon\\") can be extended with the bright star Canopus in the south. Smaller and more regularly shaped is the Winter Triangle, an approximately equilateral triangle that shares two vertices (Sirius and Procyon) with the larger asterism. The third vertex is Betelgeuse, which lies near the center of the hexagon. These three stars are three of the ten brightest objects, as viewed from Earth, outside the Solar System. Betelgeuse is also particularly easy to locate, being a shoulder of Orion, which assists stargazers in finding the triangle. Once the triangle is located, the larger hexagon may then be found. Several of the stars in the hexagon may also be found independently of one another by following various lines traced through various stars in Orion. The stars in the hexagon are parts of six constellations. Counter-clockwise around the hexagon, starting with Rigel, these are Orion, Taurus, Auriga, Gemini, Canis Minor, and Canis Major.

These sensors are commonly used near glass doors or glass store-front windows. Glass break detectors usually use a microphone, which monitors any noise or vibrations coming from the glass. If the vibrations exceed a certain threshold (that is sometimes user selectable) they are analyzed by detector circuitry. Simpler detectors simply use narrowband microphones tuned to frequencies typical of glass shattering, and react to sound above certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis to one or more glass-break profiles using signal transforms similar to DCT and FFT and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity threshold are breached.

He is one of the highest-paid actors of Hindi cinema and has featured in Forbes Indias Celebrity 100 list since 2012. Kapoor is the recipient of several awards, including six Filmfare Awards. The son of actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, and the grandson of actor-director Raj Kapoor, Kapoor pursued filmmaking and method acting at the School of Visual Arts and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, respectively. He subsequently assisted Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the film Black (2005) and made his acting debut with Bhansali's tragic romance Saawariya (2007), a critical and commercial failure. Kapoor rose to prominence in 2009 with his performances in the coming-of-age film Wake Up Sid, the romantic comedy Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, and the drama Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year. His most widely seen film in this period came with the political drama Raajneeti (2010). The romantic drama Rockstar (2011), in which he played a troubled musician, and the comedy-drama Barfi! (2012), in which he played a cheerful deaf-and-mute man, earned Kapoor two consecutive Best Actor awards at Filmfare. A starring role opposite Deepika Padukone in the romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) established him as a leading Bollywood actor. He followed this with roles in a series of films that did not perform well commercially, with the exception of the romance Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016). This changed in 2018 when Kapoor portrayed Sanjay Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's biopic Sanju, one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time, for which he won another Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In addition to acting in films, Kapoor supports charities and causes. He is also a co- owner of the Indian Super League football team Mumbai City FC. Early life and background Kapoor was born on 28 September 1982 in Bombay (now Mumbai) to Rishi and Neetu, both actors of the Hindi film industry. He is the great- grandson of Prithviraj Kapoor and the grandson of actor-director Raj. His elder sister, Riddhima (born 1980), is an interior and fashion designer. The actor Randhir Kapoor is his uncle, and his daughters, actresses Karisma and Kareena Kapoor are his first cousins. Kapoor was educated at the Bombay Scottish School in Mahim. As a student, he found little interest in academics and would rank low among his peers. However, he has stated that he performed better in sports, particularly football. Kapoor with his parents Rishi (right) and Neetu in 2013 Kapoor has been vocal about how his parent's troubled marriage affected him as a child: \\"Sometimes the fights would get really bad. I would be sitting on the steps, my head between my knees, till five or six in the morning, waiting for them to stop\\". These experiences led to a \\"reservoir of emotions building up inside [him]\\", which he said compelled him to develop an interest in film. In his early years, Kapoor was close to his mother, but had a dysfunctional relationship with his father. After completing his tenth standard examinations, he worked as an assistant director to his father on the film Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), during which he developed a closer bond with him. After completing his pre-university education from the H.R. College of Commerce and Economics, Kapoor relocated to New York City to learn film-making at the School of Visual Arts, and subsequently pursued method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. In film school, Kapoor directed and starred in two short films, entitled Passion to Love and India 1964. The loneliness of living alone in New York City coupled with his experience in film school, which he described as \\"useless\\", inspired him to pursue a career in Bollywood. Upon returning to Mumbai, Kapoor was hired as an assistant director to Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the 2005 film Black. He described the experience: \\"I was getting beaten up, abused, doing everything from cleaning the floor to fixing the lights from 7 am to 4 am, but I was learning every day.\\" He later remarked that his motive for working on Black was to get Bhansali to offer him an acting job. Career =Debut and initial success (2007‚Äì2010)= Kapoor (second from right) at an event for his debut film Saawariya in 2007 Following the release of Black, Bhansali cast Kapoor as the protagonist of his 2007 tragic romance Saawariya, alongside Sonam Kapoor and Rani Mukerji. The film tells the story of a tramp, played by him, who falls obsessively in love with a woman awaiting the return of her lover. In an interview with the news and entertainment portal Rediff.com, Kapoor stated that his character was written as a tribute to his grandfather's iconic roles as a tramp. Saawariya was the first Indian film to be produced by a Hollywood studio (Sony Pictures Entertainment), and was a highly anticipated release. However, film critics were disappointed with the picture with BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar calling it a \\"misfire on a massive scale\\". CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand considered it \\"contrived and fake\\", but was impressed by Kapoor's \\"affable charm\\" and wrote that \\"he‚Äôs got that star quality to him which is so rare to find.\\" At the box office, Saawariya failed to earn profits. However, at the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, Kapoor was awarded a Best Male Debut trophy. Despite the commercial failure of Saawariya, Kapoor was contracted by Yash Raj Films for a primary role in the Siddharth Anand-directed romantic comedy Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008). The film was his first commercial success, in which his role was that of a womaniser who is romantically involved with three women, played by Bipasha Basu, Minissha Lamba, and Deepika Padukone, at different stages of his life. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times expressed mixed views on his performance, but predicted that his \\"puppy-dog sweetness\\" would \\"serve him well as a Bollywood leading man\\". In 2009, Kapoor had three film releases. In Dharma Productions's Wake Up Sid, a coming of age film from director Ayan Mukerji, Kapoor portrayed Siddharth \\"Sid\\" Mehra, a rich, lazy teenager whose life undergoes a series of changes after interacting with an ambitious journalist (played by Konkana Sen Sharma). When Mukerji narrated the then-untitled script of the film to him, Kapoor came up with the title himself. The media expressed doubt on the film's financial prospect as it depicted a romantic relationship between a younger man and an older woman. It eventually emerged as a sleeper hit and garnered acclaim from the critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama reviewed that Kapoor's performance in the film proved that he was \\"amongst the best in the business today\\". Kapoor next starred opposite Katrina Kaif in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, a slapstick comedy from director Rajkumar Santoshi, that emerged as the fourth highest- grossing Bollywood film of 2009. Film critic Gaurav Malani praised Kapoor's flair for comedy, but criticised his \\"over-excited husky baritone\\". Kapoor's final release that year was the Shimit Amin-directed Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year, a drama about a sardar who aspires to be a salesman. Film critic Mayank Shekhar praised the film and found Kapoor's performance to be \\"astonishingly sincere\\", but the film earned little at the box office. Kapoor later professed to being highly disappointed by the film's commercial failure. At the 55th Filmfare Awards, Kapoor was awarded the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performances in all three of his 2009 releases, and he also received two Best Actor nominations at the ceremony for Wake Up Sid and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani. Kapoor with his Anjaana Anjaani co-star Priyanka Chopra in 2010 Prakash Jha's big-budget ensemble political drama Raajneeti was Kapoor's first release of 2010. The film, which starred Nana Patekar, Ajay Devgn, Arjun Rampal, Manoj Bajpayee, Katrina Kaif and Sarah Thompson in prominent roles, was inspired by the Indian epic The Mahabharata and Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather. Kapoor's role was of Samar Pratap (based on the characters of Arjuna and Michael Corleone), the youngest heir of an Indian political dynasty, who is reluctantly drawn to politics after the assassination of his father. Kapoor described it as his first complex role and considered it a departure from the \\"lover boy roles\\" that he had previously played. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India reviewed: \\"The film finally belongs to Ranbir Kapoor who perfects the art of minimalismand literally grows before your eyesas the simmering volcano that cannot be held back, once it erupts.\\" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times, however, was more critical of his performance which he considered \\"stony rather than calculatingespecially jarring compared to the histrionic turns around him\\". Indian trade journalists were apprehensive of Raajneeti recovering its investment. The film, however, proved to be a major commercial success with worldwide earnings of over . Kapoor received a third Best Actor nomination at Filmfare for the film. Later that same year, Kapoor collaborated with Priyanka Chopra on Anand's Anjaana Anjaani, a comedy-drama involving two strangers who vow to commit suicide on New Year's Eve. The film was a moderate financial success, but garnered little praise from the critics. Rajeev Masand noted that Kapoor \\"struggles with a badly-defined role\\" and NDTV's Anupama Chopra concluded: \\"Ranbir tries hard to salvage the film, dropping his shirt several times but even his lovingly shot chest can‚Äôt save the film.\\" =Critical acclaim (2011‚Äì2013)= Following an item number in the children's film Chillar Party (2011), Kapoor took on the role of Janardhan \\"Jordan\\" Jakhar in Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar, a drama that follows the journey of an aspiring musician from a humble background to international stardom. In preparation for the role, Kapoor lived with a Jat family in Pitam Pura and studied their mannerisms. He additionally learned to play the guitar and practiced extensively at A.R. Rahman's (the film's music composer) music studio. As part of the film's promotional activity, Kapoor performed at a live concert in Mumbai. Film critics were polarised on their view of the film, but were unanimous in their praise for Kapoor; Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis was particularly impressed with the film and thought that Kapoor's portrayal was one of \\"Hindi cinema‚Äôs most accomplished performances by a lead actor\\". For the role, Kapoor won both the Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics) trophies at the 57th Filmfare Awards ceremony, along with Best Actor awards at Screen and IIFA. With a gross revenue of , Rockstar was one of the top-grossing Hindi films of the year. Kapoor at a promotional event for Barfi! in 2012 The 2012 romantic comedy Barfi! was Kapoor's first release to earn over at the domestic box office. Directed by Anurag Basu, the film (set in the 1970s) tells the story of its titular protagonist (a deaf and mute man, played by Kapoor) who falls in love with a woman who is already engaged (played by Ileana D'Cruz) and later, an autistic girl (played by Priyanka Chopra). In preparation, Kapoor observed the work of actors Roberto Benigni, Charlie Chaplin, and his grandfather.Barfi! Bonus Disc: The Making of Barfi!. Event occurs at approximately 10:30 Barfi! received praise from the critics, and the performances of the three lead actors were acclaimed. Ronnie Scheib of Variety praised Kapoor for successfully channeling Chaplin in \\"tone and affect\\", and Raja Sen of Rediff.com wrote that \\"he does very strongly indeed with this Chaplin-tribute role, bestowing his character with heart every step of the way\\". The film was submitted as India's official entry for the 85th Academy Awards, and was screened at the Marrakech and Busan International Film Festivals. Kapoor won second consecutive Best Actor awards at the Filmfare, Screen, and IIFA Award ceremonies. Kapoor achieved further success in 2013 when he reunited with director Ayan Mukerji for the romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani co-starring Deepika Padukone, Kalki Koechlin, and Aditya Roy Kapoor. He was cast as Kabir \\"Bunny\\" Thapar, a commitment- phobic photographer, a character Kapoor found to be an extension of himself. His pairing with Padukone, after their highly publicised break-up, led to hype surrounding the film's release. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani emerged as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time with earnings of , proving to be Kapoor's third consecutive commercial success in three years and earned him another Best Actor nomination at Filmfare. Film critics found the film to be \\"riddled with clich√©s\\", but praised both Kapoor and Padukone, with Daily News and Analysis Tushar Joshi labelling their on-screen chemistry as \\"unsurpassable\\". Kapoor's second release of 2013 was the action-comedy film Besharam in which he played a petty thief, alongside Pallavi Sharda and his parents. The film met with an overwhelming negative reception and emerged as a failure; Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu described it as \\"Kapoor's hall of shame\\". =Commercial struggles and resurgence (2014‚Äìpresent)= After a year-long absence from the screen, Kapoor featured as a mysterious thief in Roy (2015), a romantic thriller which critic Sarita Tanwar described as a \\"boring, exhausting and pretentious\\" film. The series of financial failures continued with his next release, the Anurag Kashyap-directed crime drama Bombay Velvet, based on the historian Gyan Prakash's book Mumbai Fables, which also starred Anushka Sharma and Karan Johar. Kapoor portrayed an ambitious boxer in the 1960s who is drawn towards a life of crime; he based his tapori diction on Johnny Walker's character in Mr. & Mrs. '55 (1955). Made on a budget of , the film opened to meager box-office collections and mixed reviews from critics. Ritika Bhatia of Business Standard found Kapoor's part to be a departure from his previous roles, writing that he \\"does test the waters with methodical sincerity but his portrayal lacks depth on occasion\\". Bombay Velvet was eventually screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals. Kapoor at an event for Jagga Jasoos in 2017 Kapoor next reunited with Deepika Padukone in Tamasha (2015), a romantic drama from Imtiaz Ali. He played the role of Ved Sahni, a man who desires a career in the arts but settles for a life of monotony as an engineer. Once again, the film failed commercially and received mixed reviews from critics. Kapoor's performance was praised; Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Kapoor is beautifully cast, his trademark mix of assertive theatricality and subtle emotion well suited to the role of a man who seemingly has it all under control, until he doesn‚Äôt.\\" Kapoor's career prospect briefly improved in 2016 when he took on the lead role of an aspiring musician in Karan Johar's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016). The romantic drama, co- starring Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai, tells the story of unrequited love, and proved to be one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of the year. Critical reception was mixed; Joe Leydon of Variety thought that \\"Kapoor [is] often erring on the side of annoying while trying to balance vulnerability and self-centeredness\\". Both Tamasha and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil earned Kapoor Best Actor nominations at Filmfare. In a collaboration with director Anurag Basu, Kapoor formed a production company named Picture Shuru Productions, whose first release was the musical comedy-mystery film Jagga Jasoos (2017), which tells the story of a gifted teenager's search for his missing stepfather. Production on the project was plagued with difficultiesprincipal photography began in 2014, but the release date was pushed back several times owing to changes in the script, multiple reshoots, and rumours of animosity between Kapoor and co-star Katrina Kaif (the couple had broken-up before they finished filming). Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost considered the film to be \\"a laudable experiment that zigzags off course\\", and while praising Kapoor's dedication to his part, criticised the decision to cast him as a teenage schoolboy. It did not perform well commercially which led Kapoor to regret his venture into production. In 2018, Kapoor portrayed the actor Sanjay Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's biopic Sanju. It deals with Dutt's troubled relationship with his father, his drug addiction, and arrest for illegal possession of firearms. Kapoor was keen to avoid a hagiographic narrative and did not want to mimic Dutt's mannerisms. He interacted extensively with Dutt and took a month's time to transform himself physically before filming each phase of the actor's life. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV thought that despite dramatic liberties, the film had successfully portrayed Dutt's complexity, and wrote that Kapoor \\"pulls out the stops in astonishingly effective ways, subsuming his personality into that of the protagonist\\". Uday Bhatia of Mint was more critical for making Dutt too sympathetic despite his misdeeds, and wrote that Kapoor's \\"imitation (astonishing at times) takes over the performance\\". Sanjus strong financial performance re-established Kapoor's stardom. With earnings of over , it emerged as one of Indian cinema's biggest earners and Kapoor's highest-grossing release. He won another Best Actor award at Filmfare. Upcoming projects As of March 2019, Kapoor has three upcoming projects. He will feature opposite Alia Bhatt in Ayan Mukerji's fantasy film trilogy, the first of which is named Brahmastra. He has committed to play a dacoit in Karan Malhotra's period adventure film Shamshera, alongside Vaani Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt, and will star with Ajay Devgn in Luv Ranjan's as-yet untitled action thriller. Personal life Kapoor and Katrina Kaif in 2015 Kapoor has been vocal about his personal life, and has stated that his parents' marriage taught him how complex a relationship can be. He had his first serious relationship while in the seventh grade, and suffered from depression when it ended. While filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Kapoor began dating his co-star Deepika Padukone . The relationship attracted substantial media coverage in India and they speculated on an impending engagement. However, the couple broke up a year later. Kapoor maintained that the split was amicable, though the media widely reported that the split was due to infidelity on Kapoor's part. Kapoor later confessed: \\"Yes, I have, out of immaturity, out of inexperience, out of taking advantage of certain temptations, out of callousness.\\" Later in 2015, Kapoor stated that they both had resolved the conflict and had moved on with their lives. Since the split, he has been reticent to publicly discuss his personal life. Rumours of an affair with Katrina Kaif first emerged during the production of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani in 2009. In August 2013, a set of paparazzi photographs of Kapoor and Kaif at a beach in Spain were published by Stardust. Although Kapoor initially declined to speak of the relationship, he admitted to it in 2015: \\"Both of us are sure about our relationship and if we don't open about it now, it would be showing disrespect to the relationship.\\" As of February 2016, the media reported that they had broken up. In 2018, he began dating Alia Bhatt, his co-star in Brahmastra (2019). He also admitted to being addicted to smoking and drinking. Off-screen work Kapoor at the NDTV Marks for Sports event in 2012 In addition to acting, Kapoor is a football enthusiast and supports charities and organisations. He is the vice-captain of the All Stars Football Club, a celebrity football club that raises money for charity. In March 2013, he played the game to raise funds for the Magic Funds Organisation, an NGO for underprivileged children. Along with the chartered accountant Bimal Parekh, Kapoor acquired ownership rights in 2014 for the Mumbai-based football team of the Indian Super League, named Mumbai City FC. Also that year, Kapoor announced his participation with the digital music company Saavn as a content and programming adviser. In 2016, he featured in the documentary series Girls with Goals, to create awareness about and raise funds for YUWA, an all-girls football team in the state of Jharkhand. Kapoor supports the empowerment of the girl child and is the goodwill ambassador of Shabana Azmi's Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO which helps empower women. He supports environmental charities, and in 2011 donated money to the Community Water Initiative, a charitable organisation owned by PepsiCo. In 2012, he appeared alongside other celebrities in a short film by Zoya Akhtar to generate awareness on breast cancer. He is the campaign ambassador for NDTV's Marks for Sports, a nationwide initiative to promote fitness and health in India. In 2013, Kapoor participated in an auction on eBay, where the highest bidder gets an opportunity to interact with him; the proceeds were donated to Save the Children, a non-profit organisation that raised funds for flood affected households in Uttarakhand. That same year, he appeared alongside other celebrities in a commercial, produced by the National Film Development Corporation of India, to create awareness about children's education. In December 2014, Kapoor again took part in an eBay auction; the phiran he wore in Rockstar was sold, with proceeds going to the redevelopment of the flood- ravaged states of Kashmir and Assam. Kapoor had also fronted a campaign to collect donations for the victims of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. In 2015, he presented 2,000 raincoats to the Mumbai traffic police as an appreciation for their service during the year's heavy monsoon. In 2018, Kapoor collaborated with Aamir Khan's Paani Foundation to help local farmers and villagers suffering from drought in parts of Maharastra. In the media Kapoor at an event for Indian Idol in 2012 Born into a family of popular actors, Kapoor faced the media spotlight from a young age; Hindustan Times published that \\"he was always a star kid from whom everyone had great expectations\\". Despite the failure of his first film (Saawariya), IANS reported that he \\"rose like [a] meteor on film firmament by giving compelling performances in films like Raajneeti, Rockstar and [..] Barfi!\\" Discussing the commercial viability of Kapoor, Apoorva Mehta (the COO of Dharma Productions) noted in 2013, \\"In a short career span of 10 films, Ranbir Kapoor has achieved a tremendous jump in the business done by his films.\\" Also that year, The Economic Times credited him as \\"the most bankable actor of his generation\\". However, following the success of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, each of Kapoor's releases under-performed at the box-office.

Kapoor has frequently featured in Rediff.com's annual listing of \\"Bollywood's Best Actors\\"; he was ranked second in 2009, first in 2011, third in 2012, and held the sixth position in 2015. Kapoor has been cited as one of the most attractive Indian celebrities by the media. He has featured on The Times of Indias listing of the 'Most Desirable Man' from 2010 to 2015, ranking among the top ten each year. In 2009 People magazine listed him as the \\"Sexiest Man Alive\\" in India, and in 2013 he topped Filmfares poll of the \\"Most Stylish Young Actor\\". Also in 2013, he was one of the recipients of the \\"People of the Year\\" award by the Limca Book of Records. In 2010, he was voted the \\"Sexiest Asian Man\\" in a poll conducted by the magazine Eastern Eye. Kapoor continued to feature among the top ten of the list from 2011 to 2014. Kapoor is also the celebrity endorser for various brands and services, including Pepsi, Panasonic, Renault India, Lenovo and the Spanish football club FC Barcelona. Awards and nominations Kapoor has been the recipient of six Filmfare Awards: Best Male Debut for Saawariya (2007), Critics Award for Best Actor for Wake Up Sid (2009), Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), and Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year (2009) (jointly for the three films), and Rockstar (2011), and Best Actor awards for Rockstar, Barfi!

Changes While Higgins was always owner and publisher of the Press, other individuals served as editor, including Emmett Williams and Jan Herman. Herman took the job in 1973 and served until the press folded a year later. Higgins is quoted as saying about Herman: \\"too much an editor, and too little a fund-raiser. His idea of doing business was to wrap books and mail them away - for that one has assistants (mailing books IS fun if one can afford the time) - and he spent too little time looking for production money from foundations and wealthy people. So the press went kaput the following year...\\" -Letter to H.R. December 27, 1976 - Fluxus, The Most Radical and Experimental Art Movement of the Sixties - Ruhe - 1979 - 'A', Leidsekruisstraat 10, Amsterdam. Since Higgins had personal wealth, this account could be disputed. The press collapsed when Higgins's fortunes turned, and there was virtually no funding base in rural Vermont.

Her debut album, the critically acclaimed electronica-infused Melankton, was released in March 2006 on iTunes and April 2006 (on physical CD) in Norway only, before being licensed internationally to Universal Republic USA later. Havnevik has successfully utilized PledgeMusic campaigns to fund some of her albums, including You, released October 2011, and &i;, released March 2015. Her music has been prominently featured in TV shows such as Grey's Anatomy, The O.C., and The West Wing.  Early life  Kate Havnevik is the child of classical flautists Andrew Cunningham and Lotte Havnevik.http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/kate-havnevik/3336671 She can play the piano, the guitar, and the melodica amongst other instruments. Earlier in life, she aspired to be a classical and jazz musician, much like her parents, who are both classically trained musicians. At 14, her goals shifted when she joined an all female punk rock band, rehearsing and playing at Oslo's illegally occupied club Blitz. The experience led her to pursue an interest in classical music mixed with modern electronica.  Music career  = 2005-07: Melankton = Havnevik set about working with producers to help hone her sound, the most famous of whom is Guy Sigsworth, part of Frou Frou, who has also worked with Imogen Heap, Madonna, Jem, Britney Spears, Bj√∂rk and Alanis Morissette. Havnevik tracked down Sigsworth around in 2000, rang him and left phone messages, until one day he agreed to meet her. The pair have co-written and recorded many songs together, some of which have been featured on Melankton, including \\"Unlike Me\\", \\"Not Fair\\" and \\"You Again\\", and some of which will be included on Havnevik's second album 'You', including \\"Disobey\\", which Havnevik premiered on her official web site. She describes Melankton as \\"dramatic, beautiful and euphoric\\", and deemed it the perfect introduction to her music, which is why it is being released first. The album title is from a character in a Norwegian book Havnevik was reading, and also translates to \\"black rose\\", which she says is very fitting for the album. Melankton was mastered in Devon, partly mixed in Los Angeles, partly mixed and recorded in London, Bratislava, Oslo, Reykjav√≠k and Los Angeles. The album was premiered online on Havnevik's official web site for 48 hours from 11‚Äì12 March 2006, and was added to Apple Computer's iTunes music store on 27 March 2006. It was commercially released on CD on 3 April in Norway; a special UK edition, omitting \\"Someday\\", and instead including \\"Travel In Time\\", was released on 16 October 2006.

Havnevik also contributes vocals to R√∂yksopp's live EP, R√∂yksopp's Night Out. She co-wrote and provided vocals on the track \\"Crazy\\", featured on mono band's 2005 self-titled LP, a solo project of former Cranberries guitarist Noel Hogan. Working extensively with Guy Sigsworth, she also provided backing vocals, (as a favor), to a Britney Spears track he produced, which was released in late 2005, entitled \\"Someday (I Will Understand).\\" On December 5, 2006 she made her first ever UK broadcast media appearance, on Janice Long's BBC Radio 2 show, performing \\"Unlike Me\\", \\"I Don't Know You\\" and \\"New Day.\\" A collaboration she recorded with Carmen Rizzo, \\"Travel In Time\\", featured on Rizzo's album, The Lost Art Of The Idle Moment.

According to the hadith of Muhammad, the Qur'an and Ahl al-Bayt (\\"people of the house\\", Muhammad's family) had been described as the two weighty things. In the context of this Hadith, Muhammad's family refers to Ali ibn Abi Talib, Fatimah bint Muhammad (the daughter of Muhammad), and their children and descendants. This hadith is accepted by Shia and Sunni Islam.Hadith Thaqalayn al-islam.org Authority The Hadith al-Thaqalayn, as most strongly established hadiths, is classified in Islam as mutawatir and the authenticity of it is confirmed by numerous chains of transmission of Shia and Sunni Muslim . According to Ayatollah Ja'far Sobhani, the hadith points the authoritative knowledge of the Ahl al-Bayt and the Quran and convinces Muslim to believe in both of them together. In spite of difference over historical interpretation, Hadith al- Thaqalayn can improve the union among the Muslims world. According to Sunni tradition (canonical Hadith compiler Muslim b. al-Hajjaj), Hadith al-Thaqalayn was presented by Muhammad at a grove called Khumm. In this tradition Yazid b. Hayyan , Husayn b.Sabrah and Umar b.Muslim went to Zayd b.Arqam, one of the transmitters of the standard Ghadir Khumm. Zayd said to them that he has \\"forgotten some [of what he had heard from the prophet]\\" but he began to recite Hadith al-Thaqalayn for them as words that heard from Muhammad in The event of Ghadir Khumm. Analysis As the Allameh Tabataba'i, a philosopher and contemporary of Shia Islam, said, some points can be driven from this hadith such as \\"the Holy Quran will remain until the day of Judgment, the progeny of the Mohammad prophet will remain\\". There will not be any period of time that Shia Imam doesn't exist to guide Muslims. All the religious and intellectual needs of Muslims is supplied by pay attention to these trusts. Based on the Hadith, the authorities of knowledge and deeds belong to the household of Muhammad prophet is confirmed by him.  The Household  According to the Allameh Tabataba'i, For Shia, the people of his house turns to Ali ibn Abi Talib and his eleven descendants who were considered as Imam. This interpretation is also confirmed by Shia traditions. Ibn Abbas stated that Muhammad introduced his household Ali and Fatimah, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Jabir has transmitted that Muhammad has said \\"God placed the children of all prophets in their backbone but placed my children in the backbone of Ali\\".But Shia and some Sunni narrators maintain that the term household or family of Muhammad refer to Ali, Fatima, and their two sons because they are Muhammad‚Äôs relatives in the first degree. This belief of Shia support by Quran 3:61 -62 . According to the Sunni tradition, It was asked from Zayd, Who are the people of his house and he answered that \\"His wives are among the people of his house. Also, he emphasized that the household of Muhammad referred to the family of Ali , the family of Aqil b.Abd al-Muttalib, the family of Jafar B.Abi Talib, and the family of Abbas [b.Abd al- Muttalib].Abu al-Qasim Abd al-Karim al-Qushayri, relates a tradition pertaining to the prophet who when asked,Who are the family of Muhammad‚Äù answered‚Äùthey are every pious [Muslim]. Some writers, like Abd al-Qadir al- Jili and Muhyi al-Din Ibn Arabi, maintain the term Ahl al-Bayt referred to wives of Muhammad. Aljili believed the wives of Muhammad and other relatives such as Muhammad's uncles and their descendants.

Early life Born in Paris on August 9, 1899, Obrecht was the nephew of the chief executioner Anatole Deibler. He learned of his uncle's job at ten, when a series of postcards depicting an execution were published in September 1909. Following the death of his own son, who was born only one month after Obrecht, Deibler had a fatherlike relationship with young Andr√©, and the affection between the two men never ceased. Career =Executioner= Obrecht joined the executioners' team on April 4, 1922, as second assistant. By day, he worked in a factory as a machine operator. He remained as second assistant until 1939, when Anatole Deibler died. Due to financial obligations Deibler's widow allowed Obrecht's cousin Jules-Henri Desfourneaux and not Obrecht to succeed Deibler despite her late husband's indication that he would prefer Obrecht as his successor. Obrecht subsequently took Desfourneaux's former place as first assistant. Obrecht and Desfourneaux disliked each other. Obrecht thought his cousin too slow and badly organized. In late 1943, after having executed many French resistance fighters, Obrecht and his colleagues and friends, the Martin brothers, quit. Obrecht resumed his job in 1945, but his animosity towards his cousin had grown. After an execution in 1947, the cousins fought and Obrecht decided, for the second time, to quit. =Chief executioner= When Desfourneaux died in 1951, Obrecht wrote to the Ministry of Justice, proposing his candidature as chief executioner. This was agreed and on November 1, 1951, he was officially nominated. On November 13, he performed his first guillotining as chief in Marseilles when he executed the police killer Marcel Ythier. As time passed by, the number of executions decreased. In the early 1970s, Obrecht learned he had Parkinson's disease. Though his health was poor, he guillotined four men, Roger Bontems and Claude Buffet in Paris on November 28, 1972 (kidnap and murder of a nurse and a jail warden during a prison mutiny, although Bontems was actually found innocent of murder), Ali Benyan√®s in Marseilles on May 12, 1973 (murder of a 7-year-old girl during a hold-up) and finally, also in Marseilles, Christian Ranucci on July 28, 1976 (for the kidnapping and murder of an 8-year-old girl). Many think Ranucci was in fact innocent. =Resignation= On September 30, 1976, Obrecht resigned his position. The next day, his title was transferred to his nephew by marriage Marcel Chevalier, his assistant since 1958. Chevalier performed the final two guillotinings in France, of Jerome Carrein in Douai and Hamida Djandoubi, both in 1977. Personal life =Death= Obrecht died on July 30, 1985, in a Nice hospital.https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/world/andre-obrecht-dies-in- france-longtime-chief- executioner.htmlhttp://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb12125903r Four years later, reporter Jean Ker, who interviewed him many times, released a book called Le Carnet Noir du Bourreau (The Executioners' Black Diary), a biography.

Course The Roosevelt River begins in the state of Rond√¥nia and flows north through tropical rainforest. It is fed by the Capit√£o Cardoso River, which meets it at the state boundary. In Mato Grosso the river forms the western boundary of the Guariba-Roosevelt Extractive Reserve, a sustainable use unit created in 1996. After entering Amazonas the river forms the border between the Manicor√© State Forest, a sustainable use conservation unit created in 2005 and the Guariba State Park, also created in 2005. The river then runs through the Campos Amaz√¥nicos National Park, a protected area created in 2006 that holds an unusual enclave of cerrado vegetation in the Amazon rainforest. It continues north until it joins the Aripuan√£ River. The Aripuan√£ then flows into the Madeira River, thence into the Amazon. History and exploration Formerly called Rio da D√∫vida (‚ÄúRiver of Doubt‚Äù), the river is named after Theodore Roosevelt, who traveled into the central region of Brazil during the Roosevelt‚ÄìRondon Scientific Expedition of 1913‚Äì14. The expedition, led by Roosevelt and C√¢ndido Rondon, Brazil's most famous explorer and the river's discoverer, sought to determine where and by which course the river flowed into the Amazon. Roosevelt and his son Kermit undertook the adventure after the former U.S. president's failed attempt to regain the office as the \\"Bull Moose\\" candidate in 1912. The Roosevelt-Rondon expedition was the first non Amazonian-native party to travel and record what Rondon had named the \\"Rio da D√∫vida\\", then one of the most unexplored and intimidating tributaries of the Amazon. Sections of the river have impassable rapids and waterfalls, which hindered the expedition. Roosevelt later wrote Through the Brazilian Wilderness recounting the adventure. After Roosevelt returned doubts were raised on his account of the expedition. Roosevelt promptly rebutted them in a public forum in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the National Geographic Society. In 1927 British explorer George Miller Dyott led a second trip down the river, independently confirming Roosevelt's discoveries.\\"River of Doubt\\", Time Magazine, June 6, 1927. In 1992 a third (modern) expedition was organized, funded, and led by Charles Haskell and Elizabeth McKnight of New Century Conservation Trust, a non-profit environmental education organization in Maine, and sponsored in part by the Theodore Roosevelt Association, the American Museum of Natural History, and the National Wildlife Federation.Elizabeth Haskell 2017 This expedition consisted of a total of twenty persons including professional river guides Joe Willie Jones, Kelley Kalafatich, Jim Slade, and Mike Boyle, photographers Carr Clifton and Mark Greenburg, cinematographer Joe Kaminsky, Haskell's son Charles 'Chip' Haskell Jr. who served as the expedition's communications expert, Brazilian scientists Geraldo Mendes dos Santos and Jo√£o Ferraz (ichthyologist and pharmacologist), and chiefs Oita Mina and Tatatar√© of the Cinta Larga tribe whose land borders much of the river. The expedition took 33 days to complete the nearly 1000-mile journey. While the Roosevelt-Rondon Expedition had to portage almost all of the many rapids on the river with their heavy dugout canoes, the Haskel-McKnight Expedition was able to safely navigate all of the rapids except for one which was portaged. Haskell reported that his expedition \\"found spots chronicled by the original team, saw plants and insects they described, and went down the rapids that crushed the dugout canoes of 1914\\". The expedition members were awarded the Theodore Roosevelt Association's Distinguished Service Medal for their achievement.\\"Distinguished Service Medal\\" A documentary of the expedition was subsequently produced and aired on PBS called the \\"New Explorers: The River of Doubt\\" narrated by Bill Kurtis and Wilford Brimley.\\"The New Explorers: River of Doubt\\" Since this time, the expedition has inspired others to undergo its challenges such as Materials Scientist Professor Marc A. Meyers, Col Huram Reis, Col Ivan Angonese, and Jeffery Lehmann.\\"UCSD Explorer Struggling in Amazon\\"  Inhabitants  The upper reaches of the Roosevelt River are inhabited by the Cinta Larga people, who were first contacted in the 1960s. The Roosevelt Indigenous Reserve (reserva Roosevelt) was created in 1973 and is managed by FUNAI, occupies 2.7 million hectares, and has a population of 1,200.

Part of the mountain is in the Chattahoochee National Forest. On clear days, the peak's summit is visible for many miles and is a prominent landmark to the southeast of Georgia's Blue Ridge Mountain crest. Currahee Mountain is one of the landmarks used in the Treaty of Hopewell. It was also used by Benjamin Hawkins to run the Hawkins Line. On October 12, 1864, Confederate troops defeated Union troops at the Battle of Narrows, also called the Battle of Currahee, during the Civil War. The Confederate victory is said to have saved the area from pillage by Union troops. Casualties were small and the wounded were cared for by neighbors. View from Currahee Mountain The mountain was made famous internationally by Tom Hanks' and Steven Spielberg's television miniseries Band of Brothers, in which it was featured as a training site of the American Paratroopers at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, where they ran up and down Currahee. The name of the mountain became a motto for these paratroopers, and inspired the quote \\"Three miles up, three miles down.\\" The Colonel Robert F.

The 37,280 square metre complex is a prominent example of postmodern architecture in Canada, finished in 1987 by Jones and Kirkland. It stands at 92 metres or 302 feet. The design was influenced by farmsteads which once occupied much of MississaugaThe Canadian Encyclopedia - Mississauga: Present Day as well as historical features of city centres. The building, for instance, includes a prominent clock tower. It was chosen as the winner of a design competition that included 246 submissions. Mississauga Civic Centre is located near Square One Shopping Centre and is home to the Mississauga City Council. History Mississauga Civic Centre is the second home for City Hall and third home of local government. Cooksville Town Hall was built at Lot 16, Concession 1 SDS around 1870 and was built as single storey brick school house. It later housed Cooksville Public School from 1919 to 1921. In 1953 Township of Toronto Municipal Building at 100 Dundas Street West (Coronation Square Building) was built next to the old town hall. The old town hall structure became the east wing of the Toronto Township Municipal Building. It was designed by architect Gordon Adamson, who built International style buildings. After the 1969 fire that gut the east wing, the Township offices were relocated once the 1 City Centre Drive was made available from developers of Square One. The 1950s municipal building became home to the Dufferin-Peel Catholic School Board and Sheridan College. Abandoned, the structure was demolished in 1970. The Township of Mississauga moved to 1 City Centre Drive near Burnhamthorpe and Hurontario in 1971. It along with Square One was located on the old Robert Norman Carr farm. Built as a 5 floor office building, it was converted as a civic centre in 1971. In 1974 it became City Hall and remained so until 1984. Converted to offices by the city, it was demolished in 1988 to give way to the current glass office tower at the site. The new design by Jones and Kirkland was chosen in September 1982 an architectural design competition which drew 246 entries from 7 Canadian provinces. Architect James Stirling was on the panel of judges. =Opening of New Mississauga City Hall= The Duke and Duchess of York were part of the opening ceremonies for the new civic centre in July 1987. The Duke's impression of City Hall was \\"It's quite remarkable\\". However, the media had fun with his quote about the building due to local criticism of the structure and the fact that the media found his response to be less than sincere. Mississauga resident Don Cherry who is most notable for being on Hockey Night In Canada and a Canadian icon added fuel to the fire when he stated that the new City Hall reminded him of his home town Kingston, Ontario because it looked more like a penitentiary than a City Hall. Mississauga also faced criticism over the fact that they decided to use bricks from a U.S. company for construction instead of using a long time big brick company close by (Brampton Brick LTD) in Brampton, which borders Mississauga. The new hall is also a popular spot for bridal photo shoots.

It also features a wading pool/ice rink located on the south side of the building; to the west is the floral garden, often used for wedding pictures.

He was a representative of the avant-garde art movements Mail ArtBloch, Mark. \\"An Interview with Bern Porter,\\" 1985 and Found Poetry. In 2010 his work was recognized by an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  Biography  Bern Porter was born in Maine and studied at Colby College and Brown University. He spent the last decades of his life living in Belfast, Maine. Porter's talent showed itself at Ricker Junior College and he soon received a scholarship at the prestigious private Colby College in Waterville, Maine. His main subjects were physics, chemistry and economics. Porter earned his master's degree at Brown University. In 1935, Porter received a job with the Acheson Colloids Corporation in New York. He worked on the development of the coating of the television tube with a graphite mixture. In Paris around 1937-38 he was taken into the circle around Gertrude Stein. Porter read the manuscript of Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer (novel). After the US entry into the Second World War he worked from 1940 as a soldier for the Manhattan Project in Princeton where he made the acquaintance of Albert Einstein. He worked there and in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on creating methods for nuclear fission. He then worked at the University of California, Berkeley. His first marriage (1946) with the young student Helen Elaine Hendren failed after one year. As early as 1944 he was, even during his time at Manhattan Project in Tennessee, a pacifist, publishing an anonymous pamphlet by Henry Miller. That same year, he came into close contact with Miller in Big Sur, while he worked on a Miller Bibliography. Porter formed a small press, Bern Porter Books, which published texts by and about Henry Miller and poetry books by California poets. George Leite, a bookseller from San Francisco, published via Porter, the literary magazine Circle (10 issues, 1944‚Äì48) featuring Porter's views on the interplay of Art and Science he presented in his SciArt Manifesto (1950). Porter's parents arrived for a visit when Porter's father was arrested for fondling a 12-year-old girl, and Porter discovered that his father had a long history of molesting children in Maine. Refusing to see his father, Porter spent the next five years in Guam, working for the Guam Daily News and as a waiter and writing for an ad agency. During this time, Porter traveled in the South Pacific and meeting artists and writers and observing the rebirth of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. In 1955, upon his return to California, he married the anthropologist and writer Margaret Eudine Preston. They worked in Burnie, Tasmania in a wood processing plant and in Venezuela. In the 1960s, Porter was part of the Saturn V program at the NASA Marshall Space Centre in Huntsville, Alabama until 1967). Margaret died in 1975. Porter spent the next thirty years creating poetry, mail art, correspondence, travelling and hosting visitors at his Institute of Advanced Thinking in Belfast, Maine.  As artist  Porter is best known for his \\"founds\\", which he has published in numerous collections including Found Poems, The Wastemaker, The Book of Do's, Dieresis, Here Comes Everybody's Don't Book, and Sweet End.Kenneth Goldsmith, Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of UbuWeb, Columbia University Press, New York, pp. 220-224 Publishers of these works included Something Else Press, The Village Print Shop, and Tilbury House. Bern Porter's underground reputation as an artist-writer-philosopher-scientist is well established among visual artists and writers, and his philosophy of dissent is respected. Dick Higgins, the avant-garde writer and publisher/editor of the Something Else Press, was inspired to call Porter the Charles Ives of American letters'. Recognizing Porter as one of the earliest and most prolific practitioners of Found Poetry', Peter Frank (in his book on Something Else Press) has written: \\"Porter is to the poem what [Marcel] Duchamp was to the art object, a debunker of handiwork fetishism and exemplary artist-as- intercessor between phenomenon and receptor. He rejects the typical artist's role of semi-divine creator. Porter's eye never tires of seeking accidental, unconventional literature in odd pages of textbooks, far corners of advertisements, the verbiage of greeting cards and repair manuals, ad infinitum.\\" Porter's career is complex and filled with contradictions. He was born in 1911, in Porter Settlement, Maine. All his life Porter had a love for literature, the visual arts and poetry in particular. As a child he created countless scrapbooks filled with collaged cut-outs of texts and images from newspapers. This process, used in the early scrapbooks, would later be developed into his technique of visual collaged poetry that he refers to as \\"Founds\\". As a pioneer author of artist's books, experiments in poetry, typography, and collage Porter published his first artist book in 1941. And since then has authored dozens of books and poetry broadsides as well as created paintings, sculpture, prints, and experimented with photography (included photograms in the early 1940s). He was also an early experimenter with alternative publishing, mail art,Bloch. and performance poetry. Late in his life a series of short books and pamphlets by Porter were published by Roger Jackson Publishers in Ann Arbor, including The World of Bern, a collaboration with Louise R. Roarty. He wrote a poem called The Last Acts of Saint Fuck You, which were presented in alphabetical order, with the same number of acts for each letter. He also did a recording of this that was full of reiterations. The Maine painter and mail artist, Carlo Pittore became a major champion of Porter's work and created many works in homage to Porter including paintings, posters and artist postage stamps. Porter's thoughts on mail art were summed up in an interviewBloch. with New York artist Mark Bloch in 1985. ‚ÄúLost and Found: The Work of Bern Porter from the Collection of The Museum of Modern Art Library‚Äù was on display through July 11, 2010 at MoMA in New York.  As publisher  From 1944 to 1948, Porter and George Leite co- published a West Coast literary and artistic magazine called Circle. In 1946 Porter published Kenneth Patchen's Panels for the Walls of Heaven, an edition of 750 copies. In addition, 150 copies were reserved as an edition of painted books, uniquely decorated, signed and numbered by Patchen. Porter's imprint Bern Porter Books is best known for publishing the first editions of several works by Henry Miller.Nurenberg, Phil. \\"An Interview with Bern Porter,\\" 1980 Bern Porter Books published Miller's pacifist tract Murder the Murderers (1944) and sixteen other books by Miller, including The Plight of the Creative Artist in the United States of America (Bern Porter, Houlton, Me., 1944), Semblance of a Devoted Past (Bern Porter, Berkeley 1944), a book of watercolors, Echolalia (Bern Porter, Berkeley in 1945; at the same time in England), the Henry Miller Miscellania (Bern Porter, San Mateo, Calif, 1945), his Miller bibliography and Michael Fraenkel On the Genesis of the Tropic of Cancer (1946). Porter designed Kenneth Patchen's Panels for the Walls of Heaven (Berkeley 1946); published the first books of the young Philip Lamantia (Erotic Poems; 1946), by Leonard Wolf : Hamadryad Hunted (1948); James Schevill (Tensions; 1947) and Robert Duncan : Heavenly City Earthly City (1947). For this purpose: Parker Tyler's The Granite Butterfly: A Poem in Nine Cantos (Berkeley 1945); Yvan Goll English Poems Fruit from Saturn, a response to Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945; also in Hemispheres Editions, New York 1946); Hubert Creekmore: Formula (Berkeley 1947); Albert Cossery: Men God Forgot (1948). From Guam Porter published the first book by James Erwin Schevill: The American Fantasies (Agana 1951). In the 1950s also appearing: poetry collections of Beat filmmaker Christopher Maclaine: The Crazy Bird (1951) and Word (1954); Gerd Stern: First Poems and Others (1952). Stern was a New Yorker friend Lamantia's, of his (first) wife. From the photographer Goldian (Gogo) Nesbit, the book Graffiti (1955) and two broadsides also appeared in 1955. Other authors of the series Bern Porter Broadsides were James Catnach, Kenneth Patchen, Mason Jordan Mason (Totem and Taboo) and Porter himself. From Schevill a poetry book The Right to Greet and Selected Poems (1959). From Kenneth Rexroth : A Bestiary for My Daughters Mary and Katherine (1955).  As scientist  Prior to World War II, Porter contributed to the development of the cathode ray tube. During World War II, Porter worked on the Manhattan Project. He worked in Oak Ridge, Tennessee on the part of the project devoted to the separation of the highly enriched uranium needed to construct atomic bombs. After bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Porter regretted his involvement with the project Press release for Bern Porter-Carlo Pittore event at the Bowery Poetry Club, October 17, 2004. and became an outspoken pacifist. In the 1960s, Porter worked on NASA's Saturn V manned rocket program.http://www.ubu.com/historical/porter/index.html References  Further reading  * Bern Porter, I've Left (contains Porter's ideas about science and art) * James Schevill, Where to Go, What to Do, When You Are Bern Porter: A Personal Biography (Tilbury House Publishing) *Bern Porter at UbuWeb  External links  * Lost and Found: The Work of Bern Porter from the Museum of Modern Art Library * Listen to this page.

The brutalist style tower is the tallest building in the city, as well as the tallest building in Canada east of Montreal. Situated in the Parliament Hill borough, the building houses most notably the Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks, as well the Observatoire de la Capitale observation deck.  History  During the 1960s, as a result of the Quiet Revolution, the Quebec provincial government undertook a period of rapid expansion, resulting in a greater need for office space in the downtown area.Jean-Marie Lebel et Alain Roy, Qu√©bec, 1900-2000, p. 95, sur Google Recherche de livres In 1961, the \\"Commission d'am√©nagment de Qu√©bec\\" (Quebec Planning Commission) was formed and in 1963 the Commission produced an ambitious plan for the area surrounding the H√¥tel du Parlement. The different buildings outlined in the plan were identified by letters, hence the name \\"Complexe G\\". The first version of \\"Complexe G\\", which appeared in 1965, comprised four towers between 22 and 25 floors, a complex that would have offered two and a half times more floor space than what was eventually constructed.Jean-Marie Lebel et Alain Roy, Qu√©bec, 1900-2000, p. 100, sur Google Recherche de livres In 1969 the project was modified to include the current tower, as were two other towers between it and the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Qu√©bec. The existing buildings on the site were acquired and demolished, however these two additional towers were never constructed. Construction of the current tower began in 1967 and was completed in 1972.Commission de la Capitale-Nationale In 1987, the tower was officially renamed \\"√âdifice Marie-Guyart\\" in honour of Saint Marie of the Incarnation (born Marie Guyart), an Ursuline nun who was the religious foundress of the Ursuline order in New France.  Observatoire de la Capitale  On the highest floor of the building, the Observatoire de la Capitale provides a 360 degree view of the city from a height of 221 meters.

On March 4, 1776, troops from the Continental Army under George Washington's command occupied Dorchester Heights, a series of low hills with a commanding view of Boston and its harbor, and mounted powerful cannons there threatening the city and the Navy ships in the harbor. General William Howe, commander of the British forces occupying Boston, planned an attack to dislodge them. However, after a snowstorm prevented its execution, Howe chose to withdraw. British forces, accompanied by Loyalists who had fled to the city during the siege, evacuated the city on March 17 and sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Background The siege of Boston began on April 19, 1775, when, in the aftermath of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Colonial militia surrounded the city of Boston.Frothingham (1903), pp. 91‚Äì93 Benedict Arnold, a captain in the Connecticut militia, arrived with his troops to support the siege. He informed the Massachusetts Committee of Safety that cannons and other valuable military stores were stored at the lightly defended Fort Ticonderoga in New York, and proposed its capture. On May 3, the Committee gave Arnold a colonel's commission and authorized him to raise troops and lead a mission to capture the fort.Palmer (2006), pp. 84‚Äì85 Arnold, in conjunction with Ethan Allen, his Green Mountain Boys, and militia forces from Connecticut and western Massachusetts, captured the fort and all of its armaments on May 10.Palmer (2006), pp. 88‚Äì90 After George Washington took command of the army outside Boston in July 1775, the idea of bringing the cannons from Ticonderoga to the siege was raised by Colonel Henry Knox. Knox was eventually given the assignment to transport weapons from Ticonderoga to Cambridge. Knox went to Ticonderoga in November 1775, and, over the course of three winter months, moved 60 tonsWare (2000), p. 18 of cannons and other armaments by boat, horse and ox-drawn sledges, and manpower, along poor-quality roads, across two semi- frozen rivers, and through the forests and swamps of the sparsely inhabited Berkshires to the Boston area.Ware (2000), pp. 19‚Äì24N. Brooks (1900), p. 38 Historian Victor Brooks has called Knox's successful effort \\"one of the most stupendous feats of logistics\\" of the entire war.V. Brooks (1999), p. 210 Geography and strategy The British military leadership, headed by General William Howe, had long been aware of the importance of the Dorchester Heights, which, along with the heights of Charlestown, had commanding views of Boston and its outer harbor. The harbor was vital to the British, as the Royal Navy, at first under Admiral Samuel Graves, and later under Admiral Molyneux Shuldham,Frothingham (1903), p. 292 provided protection for the troops in Boston, as well as transportation of supplies to the besieged city. Early in the siege, on June 15, the British agreed on the plan of seizing both of these heights, beginning with those in Dorchester, which had a better view of the harbor than the Charlestown hills.McCullough, David G.. \\"Dorchester Heights.\\" 1776. New York City, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005. 70. Print. It was the leaking of this plan that precipitated events leading to the Battle of Bunker Hill.French (1911), p. 254 George Washington at Dorchester Heights by Gilbert Stuart, 1806 Neither the British nor the Americans had the daring to take and fortify the heights; but both armies knew of its strategic importance in the war.McCullough, David G.. \\"Dorchester Heights.\\" 1776. New York City, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005. 71. Print. When Washington took command of the siege in July 1775, he considered taking the unoccupied Dorchester Heights, but rejected the idea, feeling the army was not ready to deal with the likely British attack on the position.Frothingham (1903), p. 218 The subject of an attempt on the heights was again discussed in early February 1776, but the local Committee of Safety believed the British troop strength too high, and important military supplies like gunpowder too low, to warrant action at that time.Frothingham (1903), pp. 290‚Äì291 By the end of February, Knox had arrived with the cannon from Ticonderoga, as had additional supplies of powder and shells.Frothingham (1903), p. 295 Washington decided the time was right to act. Fortification Washington first placed some of the heavy cannons from Ticonderoga at Lechmere's Point and Cobble Hill in Cambridge, and on Lamb's Dam in Roxbury.V. Brooks (1999), p. 224 As a diversion against the planned move on the Dorchester Heights, he ordered these batteries to open fire on the town on the night of March 2, which fire the British returned, without significant casualties on either side. These cannonades were repeated on the night of March 3, while preparations for the taking of the heights continued.French (1911), p. 406 On the night of March 4, 1776, the batteries opened fire again, but this time the fire was accompanied by action.V. Brooks (1999), p. 225 This cannonade was continued on three successive nights, and while the British were focused on this, the Americans made preparations to implement a plan devised by Rufus Putnam to break the long siege.Hubbard, Robert Ernest. Major General Israel Putnam: Hero of the American Revolution, pp. 158, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina, 2017. .Philbrick, Nathaniel. Bunker Hill: A City, a Siege, a Revolution, pp. 274-7, Viking Penguin, New York, New York, 2013 ().Livingston, William Farrand. Israel Putnam: Pioneer, Ranger and Major General, 1718-1790, pp. 269-70, G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London, 1901. The American objective was to get cannon onto Dorchester Heights, and fortify the position. However. the ground was frozen, so digging was impossible. Putnam, who had been a millwright, devised a plan using chandeliers (heavy timbers, 10 feet long, used as frames) and fascines. These were prefabricated out of sight of the British. General John Thomas and about 2,500 troops quietly marched to the top of Dorchester Heights, hauling tools, the prefabricated fortifications and cannon placements. Hay bales were placed between the path taken by the troops and the harbor in order to muffle the sounds of the activity. Throughout the night, these troops and their relief labored at hauling cannon and building the parapet overlooking the town and the harbor. General Washington was present to provide moral support and encouragement, reminding them that March 5 was the sixth anniversary of the Boston Massacre.Gilman (1876), p. 59 By 4 a.m., they had constructed fortifications that were proof against small arms and grapeshot. Work continued on the positions, with troops cutting down trees and constructing abbatis to impede any British assault on the works. The outside of the works also included rock-filled barrels that could be rolled down the hill at attacking troops.V. Brooks (1999), p. 226 Washington anticipated that General Howe and his troops would either flee or try to take the hill,Frothingham (1903), p. 296 an action that would have probably been reminiscent of the Battle of Bunker Hill, which was a disaster for the British.Frothingham (1903), p. 194. British win, but suffer over 1,000 casualties. If Howe decided to launch an attack on the heights, Washington planned to launch an attack against the city from Cambridge. As part of the preparations, he readied two floating batteries and boats sufficient to carry almost 3,000 troops.French (1911), p. 390 Washington's judgment of Howe's options was accurate; they were exactly the options Howe considered. British reaction Admiral Shuldham, commander of the British fleet, declared that the fleet was in danger unless the position on the heights was taken. Howe and his staff then determined to contest the occupation of the heights, and made plans for an assault, preparing to send 2,400 men under cover of darkness to attack the position.French (1911), p. 412 Washington, notified of British movements, increased the forces on the heights until there were nearly 6,000 men on the Dorchester lines.V. Brooks (1999), p. 229 However, a snow storm began late on March 5 and halted any chance of a battle for several days.Frothingham (1903), pp. 298‚Äì300 By the time the storm subsided, Howe reconsidered launching an attack, reasoning that preserving the army for battle elsewhere was of higher value than attempting to hold Boston.V. Brooks (1999), p. 231 On March 8, intermediaries delivered an unsigned paper McCullough (2005), p. 99 informing Washington that the city would not be burned to the ground if his troops were allowed to leave unmolested.Frothingham (1903), pp. 303‚Äì305 After several days of activity, and several more of bad weather, the British forces departed Boston by sea on March 17 and sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, taking with them more than 1,000 Loyalist civilians.Frothingham (1903), p. 311 The Dorchester Heights Monument, completed in 1902 Legacy The fortifications on the Heights were maintained through the end of the war, and then abandoned. During the War of 1812, the Heights were refortified and occupied against potential British invasion. Following that war, the fortifications were completely abandoned, and, in the later years of the 19th century, the Dorchester hills were used as a source of fill for Boston's expanding coastline. In 1902, following revived interest in the local history, a monument was constructed on the (remaining) high ground in what is now South Boston.National Park Service The large Irish population in the area was also instrumental in having March 17 (which is also Saint Patrick's Day) named as the Evacuation Day holiday in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, which includes the city of Boston.O'Connor, p. 124MA List of legal holidays The Dorchester Heights National Historic Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and in 1978 came under the administration of the National Park Service as part of Boston National Historical Park.

There were weighted probabilities were expressed by offensive (216 outcomes) and defensive (36 outcomes) dice rolls for simplified but statistically informed results. Two additional team sets of 20 teams apiece, dating between 1940 through 1978 and 1979 through 1987 respectively, were sold before the rise of computerized sports led to the game's discontinuation in the 1990s.

Begun in 1808, it is the oldest existing lighthouse on the Great Lakes, and one of Toronto's oldest buildings. The lighthouse is perhaps best known for the demise of its first keeper, German- born John Paul Radelm√ºller, whose 1815 murder forms the basis of Toronto's most enduring ghost story. Recent research has verified many aspects of the traditional tale of his death and identified the soldiers charged with but ultimately acquitted of the crime.  History  Authorized in 1803 with two other lighthouses by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, construction of the Gibraltar Point lighthouse did not begin until 1808. It was built to a height of and extended to in 1832. The diameter ranges from about at the base to about at the top. The base is made from stone quarried in Queenston and the extension from Kingston stone. The lighthouse construction and maintenance was paid for through a harbour fee levied upon all boats entering the harbour. When completed in August 1809, the lighthouse was located from the shore. Since then, sand has built up over time so that it now stands about inland. When opened, the lighthouse was accompanied by the lighthouse keeper's cottage. It was a squared-log house clad in clapboard. It was two-stories, having two rooms on the first floor and sleeping space in the attic above. When ships approached, the lighthouse keeper would run up a flag to notify the Toronto harbor master. The cottage no longer exists. The tower light was initially an oak and glass cage, illuminated by candles. The tower switched to sperm oil from 1832 and switched to coal in 1863. The original lamp structure was wood and replaced with steel in 1878. An electric light was installed in 1916-17 and updated in 1945. In 1958, Metro Parks took over operations and made renovations in 1961-62. Currently unused, the lighthouse is occasionally open for public tours, including on the annual Doors Open Toronto weekend. Since the decommissioning of the lighthouse, smaller automated lighthouses (two located at Humber Bay Park in the west and Bluffer's Park to the east), Toronto Harbour Light, as well as floating bell or light buoys, navigational masts have been used to replace the lighthouse to provide navigational aid along Toronto's waterfront and Toronto Harbour.  John Paul Radelm√ºller  A local legend is that the lighthouse is haunted by its first keeper John Paul Radelm√ºller (often rendered incorrectly as Rademiller, Radenmuller, Radan Muller etc.), who was murdered in 1815. According to local lore, soldiers from Fort York visited J.P. Radelm√ºller on the evening of January 2, 1815, in search of his bootlegged beer. But they had too much to drink and a dispute broke out, culminating in the keeper's murder. The inebriated soldiers, so it is claimed, tried to conceal their crime by chopping apart the corpse and hiding the remains. In 1893, then-keeper George Durnan searched for the corpse and found part of a jawbone and coffin fragments near the lighthouse, though it was impossible to definitively prove they were linked to Radelm√ºller. The veracity of the legend of the murder has long been questioned. As prominent Toronto historian Mike Filey wrote, when it came to the truth of the story of the keeper's demise, \\"Your guess is as good as mine.\\" Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto. Recent scholarship has revealed more about Radelm√ºller's life and death. Born circa 1763 in Anspach, Germany, Radelm√ºller worked as a servant of royalty for twenty years, in the households of the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent, accompanying the latter to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1799. Arriving at York in 1804, Radelm√ºller was appointed as keeper of the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse on July 14, 1809. Radelm√ºller indeed suffered a violent death on January 2, 1815, aged approximately fifty-two, according to the most recent and definitive study of his murder, which confirmed the basic truth of many aspects of the popular legend. Eamonn O'Keeffe also identified the two soldiers charged with (but acquitted of) Radelm√ºller's murder as John Henry and John Blueman, both Irishmen of the Glengarry Light Infantry, a regiment that saw heavy action in the War of 1812. While research has verified much of the traditional tale, O'Keeffe cast doubt on some of the more dramatic elements of the story. Contrary to claims that the keeper's corpse was hacked to pieces and hidden, contemporary evidence suggests that Radelm√ºller's body was not mutilated, but was found after his death by 4th lighthouse keeper George Durnan and his Uncle Joe while he was a young man, and his father was the keeper. He related to John Robertson that he and his uncle had discovered bone fragments, most notably a jawbone, and fragments of a coffin 500 feet west of the lighthouse, he believed they belonged to the late Radelm√ºller.

The character has been depicted as a former member of X-Force. Actress Morena Baccarin portrays a non-mutant Vanessa Carlysle in the 2016 film Deadpool and the 2018 film Deadpool 2. Publication history Copycat first appeared in X-Force #19 (February 1993), where the character was retconned to the first appearance of Domino in The New Mutants #98 (February 1991), and was created by Fabian Nicieza and Greg Capullo. Fictional character biography The daughter of Dorothy and the late Burt Carlysle, of New Brunswick, New Jersey,Deadpool: The Circle Chase, #2, Sep. 1993 as a young mutant shape-shifter kicked out of her home, Vanessa Carlysle fell into a life of prostitution in Boston where she met and fell in love with a mercenary named Wade Wilson. Carlysle was soon saved from Wilson's vengeful employers by Zoe Culloden, a time-traveling agent of Landau, Luckman & Lake who had journeyed into the past to prevent Wilson's eventual self-destruction. That night, Wilson broke up with Carlysle after learning he had terminal illness, leaving her heartbroken. Carlysle became a mercenary herself, eventually employed by arms-dealer Tolliver. Under his orders, Copycat infiltrated X-Force in the shape of Domino while the real Domino was a prisoner. Her mission was to blow up X-Force's headquarters in order to kill Cable, but she became attached to the team members, fell in love with Cable and didn't go through with her mission. Tolliver sent Deadpool to force her to set the bomb. Deadpool would be put in her place, if she refused. Deadpool revealed Copycat's cover to X-Force, and left them for dead by blowing up the complex (without knowing that X-Force had already escaped). Vanessa briefly hid herself under the false identity (as a twin) of one of her friends; Tina Valentino. Deadpool and his associate, Sluggo, believing they killed her, killed Tina instead. She then moved in with Garrison Kane in San Francisco, until Cable found them. She was subsequently captured by the emotion-manipulating Psycho-Man, who sought Kane's advanced technology, but was rescued from the Microverse by Kane, Cable, Domino and the Microverse's resident heroes, the Microns. Later, she broke up with Kane and came back to live with Deadpool. Deadpool's feelings towards Siryn grew, so she left him after having taken his appearance to attack her, in hopes of souring their potential relationship. Some time later, Copycat was captured by Weapon X. The treatments of Weapon X destroyed her memory and she forgot her mission. Recruited by Sabretooth, Deadpool received an order to kill her. He tried to warn her, so Weapon X sent Kane to kill the both of them. The fight took them to a local zoo where Deadpool left her in a shapechanged-gorilla form among other gorillas to fight against Kane. When he returned, the other gorillas were dead and Copycat was dying from wounds inflicted by Sabretooth. She died shortly after in Deadpool's arms. However, Deadpool had poured an amount of his blood into Copycat's wounds, which, unknown to him, healed her. Vanessa then took up the identity of an owner of a chimichanga stand, and later cheated Deadpool out of one of his past marriages.  Powers and abilities Copycat is such a powerful and precise metamorph that she can duplicate another being down to the cellular level. Because of this, she is able to replicate superhuman powers, abilities, and even mental imprints so closely that telepaths have trouble identifying her. Copycat simply requires knowledge to duplicate someone's appearance, but needs physical contact to duplicate anything else. She is also capable of turning into animals, finding these forms easier to maintain than human shape. Weapon X modified her powers by accelerating the rate at which she could duplicate others. However, as a side effect of this enhancement, Copycat began to lose her memory and was unable to hold any solid form for long periods of time. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= Copycat in the Age of Apocalypse. Amazing X-Men #1, art by Andy Kubert. In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Copycat was a member of the Brotherhood of Chaos, an elite religious group affiliated to the Church of the Madri. She served alongside other members such as Madison Jeffries and Spyne. She was often referred to as Sister Vanessa or Sister Carlysle. Using her shape-shifting powers, Copycat was able to hide incognito amongst the humans who had hoped to flee North America and was able to discover the site of the Sentinel Evacuation while in their midst. Vanessa led the Brotherhood to an emigration site in Maine and there they clashed with the Amazing X-Men. In an attempt to elude the X-Man Quicksilver, Copycat posed as Scarlet Witch, but was forced to revert to her normal self by Dazzler. Both Copycat and Box were able to escape the X-Men and conceal themselves, posing as humans, and escaped to Europe. They were discovered at a checkpoint and provided a distraction for a group of Altered Humans to pass through, but were subsequently hunted down by Weapon X and Jean Grey, with the latter slaying Vanessa in the process. =Age of X= In the Age of X reality, Copycat infiltrated Cannonball's X-Force when she worked for the Human Coalition. She was unmasked and killed by Husk. In other media =Television= * Copycat appeared in the X-Men animated series. She is among the mutants on Asteroid M (in the episode \\"Sanctuary\\"). Copycat is later seen (in the episode \\"Secrets Not Long Buried\\") as one of the many residents of the mutant-dominated community of Skull Mesa. * Copycat appeared in the episode of Wolverine and the X-Men where is attacked by Sentinels. =Film= * Vanessa Carlysle appears in Deadpool, portrayed by Morena Baccarin. Though she sports a telltale streak of white hair and references are made to the \\"roles\\" she has played, Vanessa has not demonstrated any mutant powers as of yet that relate to her comic-book counterpart. This is due to writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick deciding the reveal would be too confusing, although they have expressed interest in exploring the idea in a future story. She is in a relationship with Wade Wilson to the point of engagement prior to him becoming Deadpool. Because of his transformation, Deadpool stopped seeing Vanessa, as he's afraid of her reaction to his hideous mutation. Later on while working at a strip club, Vanessa is abducted in the alley by Ajax and Angel Dust in order to lure Deadpool to a decommissioned Helicarrier. At first, upon being rescued by Deadpool following Ajax's death, Vanessa was angry at him for abandoning her. After learning about his plight, Vanessa reconciles with Deadpool. * Morena Baccarin reprises her role in Deadpool 2. At the beginning of the film, Vanessa celebrates her anniversary with Wade Wilson. As they discuss starting a family together, she is killed by a drug lord that followed Wilson home after he failed to kill him earlier. She later appears as a vision in the afterlife and tells Wilson that he must protect Russell Collins from Cable. After Deadpool sacrifices himself to save Russell, she appears again as the two are seemingly reunited, but she tells him it's not his time yet. Telling him that he has found his family, he is sent back. In a mid-credits scene, Vanessa is saved from her death by Deadpool's use of Cable's time-travel device, repaired by Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yukio.

The inverted-pyramid-shaped building contains ten storeys and was completed in 1971. Constructed of pre-cast concrete skinned in dark brown brick veneer, it was designed in the Brutalist style by architect Maxwell Miller as the head office of Sears Canada, a department store chain. It has of gross floor area. The property was sold in 2007 to the Ontario Realty Corporation, Ontario's publicly owned real estate services agency. At that time, Sears Canada relocated its head office to the Toronto Eaton Centre. The building was once connected to the adjacent building now known as the Merchandise Building, a former department store warehouse, which has since been converted to loft apartments. The Government of Ontario chose 222 Jarvis Street as a model to show that older buildings can be retrofitted to significantly reduce a building's carbon footprint. The government expected to spend $100 million on the project, including the installation of a green roof, with the objective of achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold status for the building. It was renovated to be used as offices for four ministries: Ministry of Government Services (in 2014 this Ministry was split into the Ministry of Government & Consumer Services and the Treasury Board Secretariat), Energy and Infrastructure, Research and Innovation, Economic Development and Trade, and Training, Colleges and Universities. The renovation was completed in the fall of 2011. The retrofit was undertaken by WZMH Architects, and is claimed to be as one of the largest retrofit projects in North America. It was completed under the Government of Ontario's Toronto Accommodation Plan, a ten-year plan to reduce the carbon footprint of most Ontario government office buildings in Toronto. A new two-storey glass atrium extends from the main-floor lobby and part of the second floor east toward Jarvis Street to bring in more natural light. The building has an escalator system that runs from the basement to the ninth floor. A skylight was cut into the roof to allow light into the centre of the building. Green initiatives include reusing, recycling and diverting materials away from landfill, a green roof, reflective roofing materials, a photovoltaic solar rooftop panels, an energy monitoring system, daylight and occupancy sensors for lighting control, rainwater harvesting, and limited parking capacity, access to public transit and bicycle storage to encourage use of alternative modes of transportation.

All but one of the 71 on board died. Accident The flight which was returning from a gaming/Super Bowl trip sponsored by Caesars Tahoe, took off from runway 16R at Reno-Cannon International Airport (now Reno-Tahoe International Airport) at 1:04 am on January 21, 1985. Heavy vibration started shortly after takeoff, and the pilots asked the tower for permission to make a left downwind turn, saying they needed to land. A short time later, the aircraft crashed about from the end of the runway and burst into flames. Debris was scattered across US Highway 395 and South Virginia Street; a store and several vehicles on the ground were damaged. Of the 71 people aboard, three initially survived. One died on January 29 and another on February 4. The sole survivor was a 17-year-old boy who was thrown clear of the aircraft and landed upright, conscious and still in his seat, on South Virginia Street. Because of the large number of victims, the bodies were taken to the Reno livestock Events Center, and four local medical students assisted the local coroner in performing autopsies. Investigation Air start door sketch (from NTSB report). Air start door location (from NTSB report). The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the probable cause of the accident was The NTSB found that ground handlers did not properly close the air start access door due to an interruption in their procedures: when a supervisor realized that the headset used for communication with the flight crew was not working, he switched to using hand signals mid-routine. In the confusion the supervisor signaled the flight to taxi before the air start hose had been disconnected. After the supervisor realized his error and signaled the flight crew to make an emergency stop, the hose was successfully disconnected but the air start access door was not closed. The report concluded that the open access door caused vibrations which distracted the pilots, though they would likely not have prevented the aircraft from reaching cruise speed and altitudethere had been reports from other Electra pilots that the vibrations ceased at higher air speeds. The pilots reduced power to all four engines simultaneously, presumably to see whether they were the source of the vibrations, and did not restore power quickly enough to prevent a stall. Aftermath A memorial called Galaxy Grove was dedicated at Rancho San Rafael in 1986. After the plaque was stolen in 2013, a two-ton granite replacement was installed.

During the late 19th century, it was home to Canada's first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. Since 1930, it has served as the residence of the British High Commissioner to Canada. Location and heritage status The property overlooks the Ottawa River, just east of the Macdonald- Cartier Bridge. It is located to the northwest of Sussex Drive, across from the Lester B. Pearson Building. The house is a National Historic Site and the location of a plaque erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. However, since it is a diplomatic residence, it is closed to visitors except for special public events, such as Doors Open Ottawa. It was designated as \\"Earnscliffe National Historic Site of Canada\\" on May 30, 1960. History The manor was built by Thomas McKay's company for his son-in-law, John McKinnon, in 1855. McKinnon died suddenly in 1866 and the house was purchased by another of McKay's sons-in-law, Thomas Keefer. Two years later, he sold it to Thomas Reynolds, a railroad developer. Reynolds resided there for several years, and it was during this period that the house got the name \\"Earnscliffe\\", an archaic term for \\"eagle's cliff\\". Reynolds died in 1879, and his son sold the house to Sir John A. Macdonald in 1883. Macdonald had earlier stayed with Reynolds, and there are some stories that he gave it its name. When Sir John A. Macdonald visited, they discussed about its name as \\"Eaglescliffe\\", but he suggested the old English world for eagle, \\"Earn\\" and his suggestion was accepted. In 1888, Macdonald made several additions to the structure. In 1891, Macdonald fell ill, and he died in his room at Earnscliffe. His widow, Lady Macdonald, briefly continued to reside in the home after his death, and Queen Victoria made her Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe. Soon, however, Lady Macdonald and her daughter departed for England and leased the house to Lord Treowen, commander of the militia. Over the next decades, the building was home to several local notables, including Mrs. Charles A.E. Harriss. In 1930, William Henry Clark, the first British High Commissioner to Canada, arranged to buy the house for the British government. It has been the home of the British High Commissioner ever since. On October 4, 2011, a fire damaged the building. British High Commissioner Andrew Pocock, living in the house at the time, was fine and no one was injured in the fire.

It was founded as the Glasgow Lying-in Hospital and Dispensary in 1834 in Greyfriars Wynd, just off the city's High Street. It moved to St Andrew's Square in 1841, then to Rottenrow in 1860 and to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary site in 2001. It is managed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. History Remains of the demolished Rottenrow building The hospital was founded in Greyfriars Wynd as the Glasgow Lying-in Hospital and Dispensary in 1834. Lying-in is an archaic term for childbirth (referring to the month-long bedrest prescribed for postpartum confinement). A dispensary was a place to received medicine; see for context the Dispensary movement in Manchester. The hospital moved to St Andrew's Square in 1841 and to Rottenrow in 1860. New buildings were erected on the Rottenrow site in 1881. A West End branch opened in St. Vincent Street in 1888, the same year that Murdoch Cameron performed the world's first modern Caesarean section. An extension was added in 1908 and the title \\"Glasgow Royal Maternity and Women's Hospital\\" was granted in 1914. A clinical laboratory opened in 1926 and a nurses' home was opened in 1928. The West End branch closed in 1941 after it was damaged in an air raid and a new out-patients department opened in 1955. The title \\"Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital\\" was adopted in 1960. After the old building in Rottenrow had fallen into a state of disrepair, the hospital moved to a new building on the Glasgow Royal Infirmary site in October 2001. The new facility was named the \\"Princess Royal Maternity Hospital\\". Meanwhile the Rottenrow building was acquired and demolished by the University of Strathclyde. The university re-opened the site as Rottenrow Gardens in October 2003.

It was formed in 1925 as the Socialist Party. The party publishes El Pueblo, the general secretary is Winston Alarc√≥n and the youth wing of the PCE is the Juventud Comunista del Ecuador (JCE). After its foundation PCE gradually gained in importance; in 1944 the PCE won fifteen out of eighty-five seats in the National Assembly and had one of its members appointed minister of education. The first female MP of the country, Nela Mart√≠nez, belonged to the party. In 1946 the government outlawed the PCE and jailed many of its members. The PCE was legalized during the 1948-52 term of President Galo Plaza, but was banned again when the military junta held power in 1963-1966. In 1964 PCE suffered a major split. The pro-China minority constituted the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador (PCMLE) which went on to side with Albania during the Sino-Albanian split and now maintains a hoxhaist line. In the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 2500.Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. Communism and Economic Development, in The American Political Science Review, Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar., 1968), pp. 122. Later PCE was legalized, although it had only an estimated 5000 members in 1988. The PCE participated in congressional and presidential elections as part of the coalition of the Broad Left Front (Frente Amplio de Izquierda - FADI), which gained thirteen seats in Congress in 1986. The main strength of PCE is its trade union work. PCE plays a leading role in the Confederation of Ecuadorian Workers (Confederaci√≥n de Trabajadores del Ecuador - CTE).

Her cost was approximately 12 million kronor in 1912, and the entire sum was raised in public in a nationwide fundraising campaign that gained over 15 million (approximately 650 MKr, in 2005 Kr). The fundraising was done because of the Karl Staaff government's reluctance to spend money on a new battleship. Background Sweden was not immune from the naval arms race in the early 20th century. After the dissolving of the union with Norway in 1905, the situation was tense with the Russian Empire in the east, Germany south of the Baltic Sea, and Norway, traditionally an Anglophile country. In 1911, battle-ready units from the Royal Navy and the German Imperial navy cruised around in the North Sea. War was close. As the latest Swedish coastal battleship was a typical pre-dreadnought ship (2√ó guns, ), the need for a new class of ships was pressing. Seaworthiness, armament, armour and speed, all had to be improved according to the multiple new technologies that had arrived. In 1911, the parliament voted (with a small majority) funds for the building of the new vessel, known as the F-boat, after the alternative that was chosen from various options (A, B, C, D, D1, D2, E, E1, E2 and F, varying in size from 4,800 to 7,500 metric tons and with armaments and speed in various arrangements accordingly). When Karl Staaff became prime minister in the Autumn of 1911, the funding was postponed. This caused the \\"Pansarb√•tinsamlingen\\", a fundraising aiming at the 12 million Kronor the ship was estimated to cost. With the backing of King Gustav V in a little over 3 months 15 million was raised to build the ship. This caused a political crisis, and the fall of the government. The new government accepted the money and let the contract for the ship, which was named Sverige for the people who had paid for it.Warship Magazine - 1999 After the outbreak of World War I two more ships were ordered which had a slightly changed appearance, the two bearing the names of the King and Queen of Sweden. Note that while the ship is listed as a battleship in Jane's Fighting Ships, 1938 edition, technically it is a coastal defence ship, a class which was commonly used in Nordic countries. The navies of Finland, Norway, and Denmark made use of similar ships. However, the Swedish Navy used the Sverige-class armored warships as the core of battle groups in the same manner as other navies used battleships.

Such pools are often designed so that the edge appears to merge with a larger body of water such as the ocean, or with the sky. They are often seen at resorts, estates, and in other luxurious places. History It has been claimed that the infinity pool concept originated in France, and that one of the first vanishing-edge designs was the Stag Fountain at the Palace of Versailles, built in the late 17th century. In the US, architect John Lautner has been credited as one of the first to come up with an infinity pool design in the early 1960s. He included infinity pools in various residential projects, and also created the vanishing-edge pool in the 1971 James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever. Structure An infinity pool at Mandarin Oriental, Sanya Infinity pool in a resort in Mauritius A private pool in a resort in Maldives Infinity pools are expensive and require extensive structural, mechanical, and architectural detailing. Since they are often built in precarious locations, sound structural engineering is paramount. The high cost of these pools often arises from the elaborate foundation systems that anchor them to hillsides. The \\"infinite\\" edge of the pool terminates at a weir that is lower than the required pool water level. A trough or catch basin is constructed below the weir. The water spills into the catch basin, from where it is pumped back into the pool.

Biography The son of William Dickens (1719‚Äì1785) and Elizabeth Ball (1745‚Äì1824),Dickens Family Tree website John Dickens was a clerk in the Royal Navy Pay Office at Portsmouth in Hampshire. On 13 June 1809 at St Mary le Strand, London, he married Elizabeth Barrow, with whom he had eight children. He was later transferred to London and then to Chatham, returning to live in Camden Town in London in 1822 to work in Somerset House. John Dickens found it difficult to provide for his growing family on his meagre income. Soon his debts had become so severe that all the household goods were sold in an attempt to pay his bills, including furniture and silverware. He had eight children in all and his oldest child was Frances Elizabeth Dickens whilst his second-oldest was Charles Dickens. John's debts became too much and he was put in prison for debtors. This predicament caused Charles to leave school at the age of twelve to work in a factory, as he had become 'the man of the house' and the breadwinner in his father's absence. Marshalsea Prison Described by his son Charles as \\"a jovial opportunist with no money sense\\", unable to satisfy his creditors, on 20 February 1824 John Dickens was imprisoned in the Marshalsea Debtors' Prison under the Insolvent Debtors Act of 1813, because he owed a baker, James Kerr, ¬£40 and 10 shillings.Allingham, Philip V.

On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens petitioned for, and was granted, release from prison. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act, Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea for the home of Mrs. Roylance, with whom his 12-year- old son Charles was lodging. Some years later John Dickens was again briefly imprisoned for debt, and was released only when his son Charles borrowed money from his friends based on the security of his salary. However, on his release from prison John Dickens immediately wrote begging letters to those same friends of his son also asking for money. He wrote to Thomas Beard claiming that his son Alfred \\"is walking to and from Hampstead daily in dancing Pumps\\".Ackroyd, pg 160 Later years John Dickens by Edwin Roffe Later he became a journalist, and in 1828 a parliamentary reporter, like his famous son before him.M.

Concerned about his father's financial problems, Charles Dickens rented a cottage for his parents far from London, and, as he thought, far from temptation, at Alphington in Devon. However, John Dickens merely continued to write to Charles's friends and publishers asking for money. Eventually, he and his wife returned to London. On 31 March 1851 John Dickens died of a urethral infection. According to a letter that Charles Dickens sent to his wife, John Dickens had been suffering from a bladder disease but had kept the condition secret until little could be done.

These unnecessary characters usually include white space characters, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block delimiters, which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute. Minification reduces the size of the source code, making its transmission over a network (e.g. the Internet) more efficient. In programmer culture, aiming at extremely minified source code is the purpose of recreational code golf competitions. Minification can be distinguished from the more general concept of data compression in that the minified source can be interpreted immediately without the need for an uncompression step: the same interpreter can work with both the original as well as with the minified source. The goals of minification are not the same as the goals of obfuscation; the former is often intended to be reversed using a pretty-printer or unminifier. However, to achieve its goals, minification sometimes uses techniques also used by obfuscation; for example, shortening variable names and refactoring the source code. When minification uses such techniques, the pretty-printer or unminifier can only fully reverse the minification process if it is supplied details of the transformations done by such techniques. If not supplied those details, the reversed source code will contain different variable names and control flow, even though it will have the same functionality as the original source code. Example For example, the JavaScript code // This is a comment that will be removed by the minifier var array = []; for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) { array[i] = i; } is equivalent to but longer than for(var a=[i=0];i<20;a[i]=i++); History In 2001 Douglas Crockford introduced JSMin, which removed comments and whitespace from JavaScript code. It was followed by YUI Compressor in 2007. In 2009, Google opened up its Closure toolkit, including Closure Compiler which contained a source mapping feature together with a Firefox extension called Closure Inspector. In 2010, Mihai Bazon introduced UglifyJS, which was superseded by UglifyJS2 in 2012; the rewrite was to allow for source map support. From 2017, Alex Lam took over maintenance and development of UglifyJS2, replacing it with UglifyJS3 which unified the CLI with the API. Source mapping Source maps allow tools to display unminified code from minified code with an optimized \\"mapping\\" between them. The original format was created by Joseph Schorr as part of the Closure Inspector minification project. Updates as versions 2 and 3 reduced the size of the map files. Types =Tools= Visual Studio Code comes with minification support for several languages. It can readily browse the Visual Studio Marketplace to download and install additional minifiers. JavaScript optimizers which can minify and generate source maps include UglifyJS and Google Closure Compiler. In addition, certain online tools, such as Microsoft Ajax Minifier,Microsoft Ajax Minifier. Ajaxmin.codeplex.com (13 September 2012). the Yahoo! YUI Compressor or Pretty Diff,Pretty Diff.

Downloaded on 10 April 2015. It is native to central Africa. It is 12-14.5 cm long with a 15‚Äì21 cm long tail. It weighs 40-70 g. It has long legs and a pointed, narrow head, surmounted by enormous ears. It has a very long, bicoloured tail. The back and forehead are rich orange and brown and the underside is white. The rump hairs are stiff. The link rat is nocturnal and crepuscular. It prefers seasonally flooded forest floors between Cameroon and the Victoria Nile. It has a widespread but scattered distribution and is seldom common. It feeds mainly on insects, crustaceans, slugs and some fallen fruits, notably palm-nut husks. The link rat has traditionally been placed as a member of the subfamily Dendromurinae along with the African climbing mice, but has been demonstrated to be more closely related to the spiny mice on the basis of molecular data. A new subfamily (Deomyinae) has now been created, which contains this species, plus the spiny mouse (Acomys), the brush furred mice (Lophuromys spp.), and Rudd's mouse (Uranomys).

It begins at Silt Lake, on the southern edge of the Lillooet Crown Icecap about 80 kilometres northwest of Pemberton and about 85 kilometres northwest of Whistler. Its upper valley is about 95 kilometres in length, entering Lillooet Lake about 15 km downstream from Pemberton on the eastern outskirts of the Mount Currie reserve of the Lil'wat branch of the St'at'imc people. From Pemberton Meadows, about 40 km upstream from Pemberton, to Lillooet Lake, the flat bottomlands of the river form the Pemberton Valley farming region. Below the 30 km (18.6 mi) length of Lillooet Lake, it resumes again just north of the native community and ghost town of Skookumchuck Hot Springs, which is known in the St'at'imcets language as Skatin. The lower stretch of the Lillooet River, from Lillooet Lake to Harrison Lake, is approximately 55 km (c. 34 mi) in length. Its main tributaries are Meager Creek, the Ryan River, the Green River, and the Birkenhead River. Below Harrison Lake, the stream is renamed as the Harrison River, which enters the Fraser near the First Nations community of Chehalis. The lower Lillooet River and Lillooet Lake were part of a short-lived main route between the Coast and the Interior in the days of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. See the Douglas Road. The \\"other\\" Lillooet River Until the 1910s, the name Lillooet River also applied to what is now the Alouette River in Maple Ridge; the neighbourhood that grew up on its south branch became known as South Lillooet, but to avoid confusion the new postmaster was requested to come up with a name, choosing Yennadon after his family manor on the Devonshire Moors.Yennadon The river name was changed formally on March 31, 1915 with \\"Alouette\\" chosen because of its resemblance to the sound of \\"Lillooet\\". Geology The Lillooet River was dammed with breccia from a Plinian style eruption of the Mount Meager massif 2,400 years ago. The breccia damming the Lillooet River was not very strong, and the water soon eroded the breccia that was damming the river, forming Keyhole Falls. There was a massive flood when the water first broke through the breccia. The flood was big enough that small house sized blocks of breccia were carried away during the flood.

Author Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi was born in 1617 in Isfahan. He was a student of Mulla Sadra. He has been described as the most powerful and influential Shia Ulems. On 1687, he was appointed as Sheikh ul- Islam by Sultan Husayn in Isfahan, the capital city of the Persian Empire. He developed Twelver doctrine by investigating Shia and Sunni hadith. Over 100 books in Arabic and Persian were authored by him. Prelude Majlisi compiled it to gather all the ahadith he could access. His primary goal was to preserve the available knowledge for future generations. Majlisi has acknowledged this issue in the preface of Bihar al-Anwar, emphasizing that the traditions collected were not included without being subjected to scrutiny, a task in itself that was a major undertaking. Majlisi says, \\"Then I chose to examine the traditions of the infallible, righteous Imams, started exploring them and investigated them as was their right and I acquired its skill as was its due.\\" Despite Majlisi acknowledgment, criticism has remained about his approach with some critics suggesting that he has gathered both \\"pearls\\" and \\"pebbles\\".This book includes all the narrations that receive to Shia. Writing Bihar lasted about 36 years. To write this book, Majlisi got help from other scholars and his students. Context Bihar al-Anwar as the most comprehensive hadith collections includes narrations of Shias (Twelver), based on Shia sources. The collection also contains his commentary on these narrations. He used about 400 sources which were written by Sunni and Shia scholars such as, Shaykh al- Saduq, Shaykh Tusi, Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid, Sharif al-Murtaza, Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili, Sayyed Ibn Tawus, Al-Hilli, Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili.

It was invented by the 18th century Dutch scientist MusschenbroekHistoric scientific instruments in DenmarkHutton, Charles A Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary A tribotester is the general name given to a machine or device used to perform tests and simulations of wear, friction and lubrication which are the subject of the study of tribology. Often tribotesters are extremely specific in their function and are fabricated by manufacturers who desire to test and analyze the long-term performance of their products. An example is that of orthopedic implant manufacturers who have spent considerable sums of money to develop tribotesters that accurately reproduce the motions and forces that occur in human hip joints so that they can perform accelerated wear tests of their products. Theory thumb A simple tribometer is described by a hanging mass and a mass resting on a horizontal surface, connected to each other via a string and pulley. The coefficient of friction, ¬µ, when the system is stationary, is determined by increasing the hanging mass until the moment that the resting mass begins to slide. Then using the general equation for friction force: :F = \\\\mu\\\\N Where N, the normal force, is equal to the weight (mass x gravity) of the sitting mass (mT) and F, the loading force, is equal to the weight (mass x gravity) of the hanging mass (mH). To determine the kinetic coefficient of friction the hanging mass is increased or decreased until the mass system moves at a constant speed. In both cases, the coefficient of friction is simplified to the ratio of the two masses: :\\\\mu\\\\ = m_H / m_T In most test applications using tribometers, wear is measured by comparing the mass or surfaces of test specimens before and after testing. Equipment and methods used to examine the worn surfaces include optical microscopes, scanning electron microscopes, optical interferometry and mechanical roughness testers. Types Tribometers are often referred to by the specific contact arrangement they simulate or by the original equipment developer. Several arrangements are: * Four ball * Pin on disc * Ball on disc * Ring on ring * Ball on three plates * Reciprocating pin (usually referred to as SRV or HFRR) * Block on ring * Bouncing ball * Fretting test machine * Twin disc =Bouncing ball= A bouncing ball tribometer consists of a ball which is impacted at an angle against a surface. During a typical test, a ball is slid on an angle along a track until it impacts a surface and then bounces off of the surface. The friction produced in the contact between the ball and the surface results in a horizontal force on the surface and a rotational force on the ball. Frictional force is determined by finding the rotational speed of the ball using high speed photography or by measuring the force on the horizontal surface. Pressure in the contact is very high due to the large instantaneous force caused by the impact with the ball. Bouncing ball tribometers have been used to determine the shear characteristics of lubricants under high pressures such as is found in ball bearings or gears. =Pin on disc= A pin on disc tribometer consists of a stationary pin that is normally loaded against a rotating disc. The pin can have any shape to simulate a specific contact, but cylindrical tips are often used to simplify the contact geometry. The coefficient of friction is determined by the ratio of the frictional force to the loading force on the pin. The pin on disc test has proved useful in providing a simple wear and friction test for low friction coatings such as diamond-like carbon coatings on valve train components in internal combustion engines.

The screenplay was written by Michael Winder, based on the short story \\"There Shall Be No Darkness\\" by James Blish, which was originally published in Thrilling Wonder Stories. The film stars Calvin Lockhart, Peter Cushing, Marlene Clark, Michael Gambon, Charles Gray, Anton Diffring, Ciaran Madden and Tom Chadbon.Ed. Allan Bryce, Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood, Stray Cat Publishing, 2000 p 138-143 A millionaire big game hunter gathers six people at his remote English mansion, announcing that he suspects one of them is a werewolf. The viewer is invited to unfold the mystery along with the characters. Near the end, there is a 30-second pause called the \\"werewolf break\\", where the audience is asked to guess the werewolf's identity, based on clues from the movie. An alternate version of the film was released under the title Black Werewolf. This cut omits the \\"werewolf break\\" near the climax. Plot summary Millionaire Tom Newcliffe (Calvin Lockhart) invites a group of people to spend some time in his rural English mansion, along with his wife Caroline (Marlene Clark) where he reveals that one of them is a werewolf and therefore must be killed. The group is composed of disgraced diplomat Arthur Bennington (Charles Gray); Jan and Davina Gilmore (Michael Gambon and Ciaran Madden), a pianist and his ex-student, now his wife; Paul Foote (Tom Chadbon), an artist recently released from prison; and Professor Lundgren (Peter Cushing), an archaeologist and a lycanthropy enthusiast. They all stay in the mansion where they are submitted to various tests to detect whether they might be a werewolf. The entire house is under surveillance by CCTV cameras, as well as motion sensors in the grounds around the mansion set up and overseen by Tom's associate Pavel (Anton Diffring), who does not believe in werewolves. The only way to determine the identity of the werewolf is for a certain combination of elements to occur all at once, including a full moon and the presence of wolfsbane pollen in the air. When this fails to produce any lycanthropic reactions, Tom makes each of the potential werewolves grab silver objects to provoke allergic reactions, but this too proves unsuccessful. Later that same night, Pavel is killed by the werewolf, which makes Tom even more obsessive in his hunt, to his wife's increasing annoyance. Tom gradually focuses his suspicions on Paul Foote, who was reportedly arrested after eating human flesh. Foote denies being the werewolf as the creature continues killing, with the helicopter pilot, diplomat Arthur Bennington, and Caroline's dog all falling victim. Tom subjects the remaining group to one final test: placing a silver bullet in their mouth. As Caroline submits to the test, her hairy, clawed hand is shown before she immediately transforms into the werewolf. She (fully transformed) attacks Tom, and he kills her by shooting her with a silver bullet, leaving him very distraught and confused because Caroline was alongside him when the werewolf killed her dog. Prof. Lundgren deduces that Caroline must have contracted the werewolf disease while taking care of her dog's wounds due to an open cut on her hand she sustained from a broken wineglass at dinner. Tom becomes enraged, convinced that Foote is the werewolf. When he attempts to confront him, however, he finds that Foote has also been killed. To avenge his wife, he enters the woods surrounding the mansion to hunt the werewolf. He finds the beast and finally shoots and kills it. Once dead, the werewolf reverts to its human form, and it is revealed to be Jan, the pianist. Tom returns to Prof. Lundgren and Davina, and he realizes that he was bitten by the werewolf during the scuffle, thus condemning him to inherit the creature's curse. Not wanting to be a monster, Tom locks himself in the mansion and shoots himself in the head with a silver bullet, ending the werewolf's bloodline.

I hated it. It stopped the film stone dead and I thought it was completely artificial and unnecessary\\". It was not in Annett's version of the film; he attributes the idea to producer Milton Subotsky. He does admit that some, including critic Leonard Maltin, liked it. Allmovie wrote, \\"The non-anthology output of Amicus Productions tended to be hit-and-miss, but The Beast Must Die is an interesting if lightweight horror-mystery hybrid from the studio.\\" DVD release The film was released on DVD as part of the Umbrella Entertainment box set Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood. This edition includes the following special features: commentary by director Paul Annett, a \\"Directing The Beast\\" featurette, and Amicus Collection trailers.

The company also develops and licenses internet software and social media applications. Businesses The company operates two divisions: consumer internet and licensing. =Consumer Internet division= The consumer internet division owns and operates more than 95 websites in seven categories. The company attracts more than 62 million unique visitors per month, with 97% of the audience originating from organic, non- paid sources. The company's strategy is to focus on specific target audiences that tend to be attractive to advertisers. On December 1, 2010, Internet Brands acquired AllLaw.com and AttorneyLocate.com, both founded by Arvind A. Raichur. SEC filings indicate that approximately 70% of the company's revenues are derived from advertising from more than 40,000 accounts‚Äîmost of them small and medium enterprises. The company's portfolio of websites include many with social media features: social network services, user generated content, blogs, wikis, and internet forums. History The company was founded in 1998 as CarsDirect.com, launched from the business incubator Idealab. The company invented a consumer-advocacy approach to selling cars \\"haggle-free\\" online, an approach it continues to employ. In 2000, Roger Penske invested in the company and joined the Board of Directors. In 2002, Time Magazine voted the site one of the 50 best in the world. The company changed its name to Internet Brands in 2005. The company's IPO was in November 2007 on the NASDAQ exchange. INET was added to the NASDAQ Internet Index on March 22, 2010. Internet Brands agreed to be acquired for $640 million by the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman in September 2010 and was thus delisted from NASDAQ. In September 2012, Internet Brands became involved in a legal battle with the Wikimedia Foundation (the operators of Wikipedia) over the future of Wikitravel's community. Internet Brands was acquired in June 2014 by KKR from Hellman & Friedman for 1.1 billion dollars. KKR is making its investment in partnership with Internet Brands chief executive officer Bob Brisco and the Internet Brands management team, who will hold a minority stake in the company and continue to run the business. In January 2016, Intuit Inc. announced an agreement to sell Demandforce to Internet Brands. Controversies =vBulletin criticism= In October 2009, Internet Brands changed the pricing structure for its vBulletin software, prompting complaints from registered users on the official forums. According to The Register those who complained were then banned from both the forums and from receiving support and updates, despite still having valid licences for the product. Internet Brands defended their position to The Register in a separate article; however, a later update to the same article stated that at least some of Internet Brands' claims were false. =vBulletin and XenForo= In October 2010, Internet Brands announced that it would file a lawsuit against the XenForo team claiming copyright infringement; specifically that code in XenForo was based on vBulletin code, breach of contract, and engaging in unfair business practices. In November 2010, Internet Brands sued Kier Darby, a lead developer of XenForo, who had previously served as a lead developer for Internet Brands' vBulletin, claiming that Kier had not returned confidential information from Internet Brands regarding the vBulletin software. The XenForo team has denied the claims. In February 2013, the lawsuit was dismissed. =Wikitravel and Wikimedia= In 2012, after a lengthy history of dissatisfaction, community members at Internet Brands-owned website Wikitravel began discussing whether to fork (split off) of their work and editing activities from Wikitravel and recommence their editing activities at another website host. The dissatisfaction related to long standing discontent at poor hosting, poor site updates, and excessive over-monetarization and advertising, and eventually, interference by Internet Brands in the community's activities in breach of prior agreements and understandings.Migration FAQ at Wikivoyage, 25 October 2012 Forking is a normal or anticipated activity in wiki communities and is permitted by the Creative Commons license in use on sites such as WikiTravel, and the wiki software used for WikiTravel included the facility to take 'database \\"dumps\\"' for that purpose. This mirrored the fork of the German and Italian language Wikitravel communities some years earlier, which led to a new travel wiki site called Wikivoyage. Members of the communities concerned decided that the community at Wikitravel would move its editing efforts to merge with Wikivoyage, to create a new travel wiki to be hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, the owner of Wikipedia and a large range of other non- profit reference sites based upon a wiki community. The merge and move were endorsed by the editing community, but opposed by Internet Brands who litigated against two users it accused of unlawful actions related to the proposal. The allegations were strongly rejected by the individuals and the (non-party) Wikimedia Foundation who stated the case was an example of a SLAPP lawsuit intended to deter and frustrate lawful conduct. On November 19, 2012, the claims by Internet Brands were dismissed by the United States District Court for the Central District of California. =Greenlight Financial Services= In April 2013, on behalf of its client Greenlight Financial Services, Inc., the Rhema Law Group won a jury verdict trial against Internet Brands, Inc. The Orange County Superior Court jury found that Internet Brands breached a previous settlement agreement between the parties and awarded lost profits damages in the amount of $750,000. = Model Mayhem = In May 2008 Internet Brands bought Model Mayhem from the original developers Donald and Tyler Waitt. Between 2006 and 2011 Lavont Flanders and Emerson Callum used Model Mayhem to contact women, arrange to meet them, drug them and then rape them while filming them, later publishing the video as pornography. Internet Brands allege that Tyler Waitt was aware of the investigation into Flanders and Callum at the time of the sale and are refusing to pay him for the site. Waitt in turn sued Internet Brands. One of Flanders's and Callum's victims is suing Internet Brands for failing to notify her of the danger posed by Flanders and Callum.

He occupied posts in the Philippines, Madrid, and Melilla, and later returned to Cuba. He organized the defense of Santiago de Cuba during the Battle of San Juan Hill. Linares failed to reinforce this position, choosing to hold nearly 10,000 Spanish reserves in the city of Santiago.

Rather than being on the forward or military crest of the San Juan Height where they could have a clear field of fire all the way down the hill, they were constructed on the hilltop, itself allowing the Americans to escape even near point-blank rifle volleying at the advancing Americans when they went below the Spanish soldiers lines of observation.

Early life and education Boulton, the son of pioneering anaesthetist Dr Thomas Babington Boulton OBE (1925‚Äì2016), (of a family of bank managers and clerks, but with a medical tradition on his mother's side),https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dr-tom- boulton-ncwrn93kk and Helen (n√©e Brown)https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/lives-of-the- fellows/dr-thomas-babington- boultonhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/07/13/dr-thomas-boulton- pioneering-anaesthetist-- obituaryhttps://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-246011/version/7 was educated at Tower House School, a preparatory school in south-west London, at St Andrew's School, Pangbourne, a preparatory school in Berkshire, and at Westminster School, a boarding school for boys in Westminster in Central London, where he took A-levels in English, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. He then studied at Christ Church, Oxford, and Johns Hopkins University where he gained degrees in English and International Relations. In 2013 Boulton received an Honorary Doctorate of Business from Plymouth University. Life and career Boulton speaking alongside Jon Cruddas at a Policy Exchange event in 2012 Before joining Sky News, Boulton worked as a journalist in the parliamentary lobby. He was then political editor for TV-am, where his colleague was Kay Burley who later joined Sky News. It was during the 1987 general election that he was punched by Denis Healey after Anne Diamond asked Healey about his wife using private healthcare; the incident was witnessed by gossip columnist Nigel Dempster. Since 2017, Boulton has presented All Out Politics on Sky News, from 9am to 11am, Monday to Friday, and also maintains a blog on the Sky News website. On 15 June 2008 he became the first British television reporter to conduct a joint interview of US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura. Boulton also presents a review of Prime Minister's Questions, on a Wednesday evening with regular guests to discuss the performance of ministers involved in the House of Commons earlier in the day and more seriously, the legislation and ideas that they present to the house. Boulton was based in Washington, D.C. from January 2009, covering the First 100 days of Barack Obama's Presidency of the United States for Sky News. On 22 April 2010, during the UK General Election campaign, Boulton hosted Sky News' 'Leaders' Debate' live from Bristol, the second in a series of three televised debates between Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg produced, in turn, and on consecutive Thursdays, by ITV News, Sky News and the BBC. Boulton presenting Sky News with Kay Burley in May 2010 On 10 May 2010, while covering events on the aftermath of the 2010 general election, Boulton lost his composure with former 10 Downing Street Director of Communications Alastair Campbell, defending his impartiality in a live on-air interview after Campbell accused Boulton of political bias in favour of the Conservatives. Boulton shouted at Campbell: \\"Don't tell me what I think\\". At the time both Labour and the Conservatives were trying to broker a deal with the Liberal Democrats aimed at forming a coalition government. A similar disagreement occurred later on that evening in an exchange with Ben Bradshaw. The media regulator Ofcom received several hundred complaints about the Campbell incident from viewers. During the campaign he had been asked to calm down by Peter Mandelson when he questioned him about possible spending cuts that the Financial Times believed would have to be made following the election. He was also accused of bias for the way he questioned Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, it was claimed in contravention of the pre-established rules, during the Leader's debate hosted by Sky News. Ofcom rejected the complaints. On 20 January 2011 Boulton once again interviewed Alastair Campbell on Sky News, ahead of Tony Blair's appearance in front of the Iraq Inquiry. Both apologised about the incident and shook hands at the end of the interview. Boulton won the Royal Television Society's supreme Judge's Award and was elected the 2007 Chairman of the Parliamentary Lobby. He has written for newspapers and magazines including The Times, Sunday Times, Guardian, Spectator, New Statesman and Independent. He has been a guest of programmes such as Newsnight, Bremner, Bird and Fortune and Have I Got News for You. He has interviewed every British Prime Minister from David Cameron back to Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Personal life Boulton divorced his first wife Kerena Anne Boulton after his affair with Tony Blair's spin doctor Anji Hunter became front page tabloid news in 2002. Kerena is the sister of former Labour Minister and environmentalist Peter Mond, 4th Baron Melchett, and eldest daughter of former British Steel Corporation Chairman Julian Mond and Sonia Melchett, writer and socialite. Boulton married Hunter at St James's Church, Piccadilly on 22 July 2006. Both have children from their previous marriages.

The cheese has been made in Auvergne since at least the 17th century.  History  Up until the 17th century, the Saint-Nectaire cheese was farmstead, and mostly made by women. It was also called ‚Äúrye cheese‚Äù, as it was matured on rye. It is known for its creamy and unctuous paste and hazelnut flavour. It was introduced to the court of King Louis XIV by the marshal of France Henri de La Fert√©-Senneterre (1600‚Äì1681), where the cheese immediately gained the king's favour. By 1768, it was already widely recognized, as Legrand d‚ÄôAussy described the cheese in a story about his trip to Auvergne: \\"If someone wants to treat you to a feast, there is always going to be some Saint-Nectaire\\". The Marshal of Senneterre was also responsible for the introduction of the cheeses Cantal and Salers.  Description  This cheese is a non-baked cheese with compressed paste, made from cow's milk, mainly of Holstein and Montb√©liarde and sometimes Salers. It has a cylindrical shape, is about wide, and is about thick. It never weighs more than . The ‚Äúpetit-Saint- Nectaire‚Äù is wide, thick, and the weight doesn't exceed . The cheese has a rind that is similar on both sides, with few moulds. Depending on how old the cheese is, the rind can be white, brown or grey, and with orange, yellow, or red patches. If a cheese has a uniform colour, it can't be sold as a Saint- Nectaire cheese. There is a minimum of 45 grams of fat per 100 grams of cheese once the cheese is desiccated. The whole refined cheese must have less than 50% of dry-matter content. Once cut, the Saint-Nectaire has a soft, fluid and smelly paste, of a creamy colour. Its taste has a hint of hazelnut, due to the aromatic flora where the cheese ages.  Terroir  The cheese is made in a grassy and volcanic area, around the Pays des Monts-Dore. The region authorized to produce Saint-Nectaire includes a total of 72 villages, 52 of which are in Puy-de-Dome (including the village of Saint-Nectaire) and 20 of which are in Cantal.  Appellation  Saint-Nectaire is an Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC), a certification given to French agricultural products based on a set of clearly defined standards. For example, it must be made of cow's milk in a specifically delimited area in the Monts-Dore region. The Appellation was first recognized at a national level and awarded AOC status in 1955. At that time, the Saint-Nectaire cheese was only produced on farms from milk from their own cows. When the appellation was accorded, industrial milk and dairy factories were also allowed to produce Saint- Nectaire. To differentiate between products made from the two processes, farmstead cheeses are marked with a small oval label in green casein, while a square label is applied to industrial cheeses. In 1996, a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) was given to Saint-Nectaire, extending name protection to the entire European Union. A new appellation, ‚Äúpetit-Saint- Nectaire‚Äù (meaning \\"small Saint-Nectaire\\"), given to cheeses that weigh 600 grams, was later included in the specifications.  Manufacture  Box of saint Nectaire before aging (affinage) Farmstead Saint-Nectaire cheese is always made of whole and unpasteurised milk, two times a day, right after each milking. Industrialized Saint-Nectaire cheese can be made of mixed milks, or thermised or pasteurised milks. of milk are necessary to the elaboration of a single cheese. After each milking, and once the milk is pasteurised, rennet is added to the milk and renneted for a period of 30 to 40 minutes, whether it is an industrial or farmstead cheese. The curd obtained is then uncurdled with a lyre, an instrument made of metal. The milk is uncurdled in order to obtain bits of renneted cheese about the size of wheat grains. The next stage of the production is the picking up of the grains, which fall and are gathered to the tank bottom. Then, the operator removes the whey that makes up for 80% of the initial volume of milk. The milk serum or milk permeate is later given to the cows, spread in the fields. It can also be collected by some dairy industries that extract cream from it, turn it into powder to feed the calves, or use it in the elaboration of other food products, such as chocolate and pre-packaged- meals. Once drained, the bits of renneted milk are pressed for the first time into their mould using a machine. The compressed cheese is called tome. The tome is then wrapped into linen, a little casein stamp (oval or square) is put on top of it, and the cheese is salted (with some brine). Next it is put into a press for 12 to 24 hours. The next step is called ressuyage (lit. \\"re- wiping\\"), when the cheese is unwrapped, and stored in a cold room, at , with between 40% to 60% relative humidity. Farmers and dairy producers can allow the ‚Äútome‚Äù to mature, or sell to cheese aging specialists. Farm-produced Saint-Nectaire (non-industrial) has an edible rough and irregular rind. The affinage (maturing process) starts for a duration of a minimum of 28 days, according to the specification (reduced to 21 days for the \\"petit-Saint- Nectaire\\"). In general, it takes five to six weeks to a farmstead cheese, but it can last up to two or three months, for a cheese to mature. In the meantime, the cheeses are washed several times with salted water, and are regularly turned over, to obtain the orange-grey rind, that is specific of the Saint-Nectaire cheese. The cheese are aged on rye straw. The majority of Saint-Nectaires are transported to a professional affineur for the final six weeks of the affinage. The affinage is cut short if it is decided that the flavour and scent are not developing sufficiently.  Production  The Saint- Nectaire is the first farmstead Appellation in France, in terms of volume. It represents 6,500 tons per year, and the number of farmstead producers amounts to 240 farmers. Moreover, the dairy industries and cheese factories produce 7000 tons. A total of 13,500 tons of cheese were produced in 2007.  Gastronomy  The cheese can go with any kind of meal. It can be used in tarts, pies and buns.  Tourism  The village of Saint-Nectaire ‚ÄúLa Maison du Saint-Nectaire‚Äù, or House of Saint-Nectaire, is located in the village of Saint-Nectaire, on the road of Murol. It is a museum, which shows the history and the methods of production of Saint-Nectaire.  Anecdotes  The cheese's name comes from the Marshal of Senneterre (a linguistic corruption of \\"Saint- Nectaire\\"), who served it at the table of Louis XIV.

Olsen produced over 100 complete albums. His production work earned him more than 39 Gold, 24 Platinum, and 14 Multi-Platinum album certifications. Career Olsen was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, United States, and went to school in Minneapolis, where he developed an appreciation for classical, pop, and jazz music. He gained production experience working in recording studios in the Minneapolis area, and musical and touring experience playing upright bass in jazz and folk bands. He subsequently played bass as a member of the Music Machine, who had a hit with the single \\"Talk Talk\\". During this time he began collaborating with Curt Boettcher, producer of the Association's single \\"Cherish\\", and met another early influence, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, who taught him \\"to envision everything about a production as you hear the song the first time.\\" After moving to Los Angeles he was instrumental in launching the careers of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. He helped them to secure a record deal, produced their first album, Buckingham Nicks, and let them live in his house, employing Nicks as a housekeeper for a while. After introducing them to Mick Fleetwood, he went on to produce Fleetwood Mac's eponymous 1975 album, which reached No. 1 in the US. Through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Olsen built a reputation as a producer. In addition to Fleetwood Mac, some of the artists he has worked with include the Grateful Dead (he produced and engineered their 1977 album Terrapin Station); Bob Weir; Eddie Money; Emerson, Lake & Palmer; Rick Springfield (he produced Springfield's No. 1 hit \\"Jessie's Girl\\"); REO Speedwagon; Pat Benatar; Heart; Joe Walsh; Starship; Santana; Kim Carnes; Sheila; Jethro Tull; the Babys; Magnum (Goodnight L.A.); Saga; Ozzy Osbourne (No Rest for the Wicked); Scorpions (Crazy World); Bad Company; Europe; 38 Special; Russ Ballard; Sammy Hagar; Whitesnake; Foreigner; Sheena Easton; Steve Perry; Journey; Loverboy; and Lou Gramm.

It is south of the city centre, on the east side of the River Severn, near Junction 7 of the M5 motorway. In the 2011 census, the parish population was recorded as 5,851. Church and parish The parish is named after the Church of St Peter the Great (so named to distinguish it from the chapel of Worcester Castle, \\"St Peter the Less\\"), formerly located between King Street and Sidbury in Worcester, by the Royal Worcester porcelain factory (now the Museum of Royal Worcester). The medieval church was rebuilt in brick in the style of a Commissioners' church in 1836/37. This building became structurally unsafe, was closed in 1972, declared redundant in 1974 and demolished in 1976. The church site is now housing and a car park (2016). The church parish was joined with that of St Martin's Church, London Road, the combined parish of St Martin with St Peter being established on 1 August 1974. The congregation and the World War I memorial were transferred there. The ancient parish included parts within and outside the city of Worcester. In 1894 the parish was divided civilly: the part within the county borough of Worcester became the civil parish of St Peter the Great City (merged into the civil parish of Worcester in 1898), the part outside the city became the civil parish of St Peter the Great County, the basis of the modern Parish of St Peter the Great. St Peter's Parish Council was created in 1994. Suburb The Ordnance Survey map of 1977 shows St Peter the Great County as farmland, with a main road and a single country road with a few cottages. The housing estate was developed in the 1980s and 1990s. St Peter the Great, or \\"St Peters\\" as it is commonly abbreviated to, is mainly a large housing estate with a large Tesco superstore, a petrol station and a small shopping area containing a convenience store, a Chinese takeaway, a chip shop, a dentist, a beauty salon, chemist, dry cleaner, charity shop and a part-time GP surgery close to the village hall. In 2007, despite objections from some local residents, a Baptist church St Peter's Baptist Church opened close to the centre of the estate, the church centre is used for worship, meetings and youth activities also meetings of other groups. In September 2013, a large scale planning request was made to the County Council to build further dwellings, together with commercial and light industrial buildings.

They are located between the drainage of the Lillooet River and Harrison Lake on the west and the canyon of the Fraser River on the east, and by the lowland coastal valley of that river on the south. The Lillooet Ranges are approximately 8100 square kilometres (3150 mi¬≤) in area. The range is extremely rugged and varied in terrain, and includes some of the highest peaks in southwestern British Columbia. The highest is Skihist Mountain, , crowning the Cantilever Range in the heart of the area to the west of the community of Lytton at the confluence of the Thompson and Fraser Rivers. The northernmost subdivision of the Lillooet Ranges is the Cayoosh Range, which includes the second-highest summit in the Lillooet Ranges, an unnamed peak just south of Seton Lake and about WSW of the town of Lillooet. To the northeast of Harrison Lake, Mount Breakenridge stands tall and poses a significant local landslide tsunami risk to the area. There are a number of provincial parks and recreation areas within the boundaries of the Lillooet Ranges. The largest and most important is the Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park, which takes in the entire Stein River basin, immediately west of Lytton and east of Pemberton-Mount Currie. \\"The Stein\\" is the largest unlogged watershed in the southern Coast Mountains and, like the rest of the Lillooet Ranges, varies from coastal-type alpine in the west to desert-canyon arid on its east. There is only one highway traversing the Lillooet Ranges, Hwy 99 from Mount Currie to Lillooet, via the valley of Cayoosh Creek. North of that highway is the subarea known as the Cayoosh Range, which contains the second-highest peak in the Lillooet Ranges, an unnamed summit just south of Seton Lake. The main watersheds entirely within the Lillooet Ranges are those of Cayoosh Creek, the Stein River, the Nahatlatch River, and the Silver River (a.k.a. the Big Silver River).

It concerns a group of people on a remote country manor who discover that one of their number is a ravenous werewolf. The story was adapted for the screen in 1974 as The Beast Must Die. Blish himself described the story as \\"a schoolboy pastiche of Dracula\\". The story originally appeared in Thrilling Wonder Stories. It was first published in book form by Twayne Publishers in 1952 in the fantasy anthology Witches Three, a volume that also included Fritz Leiber's Conjure Wife and Fletcher Pratt's The Blue Star. The story attempts to offer a scientific explanation for lycanthropy. One of the characters, a psychiatrist named Christian Lundgren, states that the condition is the result of a mutation in the pineal gland of the afflicted person's brain. At the same time Blish also relies on established werewolf mythology for plot devices, such as the use of wolfsbane and silver. A female character named Doris is revealed to be a witch, and this subplot is important to the story's resolution. Plot The story takes place on a manor in the Scottish countryside. A wealthy man named Tom Newcliffe has invited a group of artists and friends together for a weekend gathering. Of particular importance to the story is Jan Jarmoskowski, a Polish concert pianist. Paul Foote, a painter, detects hints that Jan may in fact be a werewolf, and he is proven right. The musician transforms under the light of the full moon, and the guests at first prepare some makeshift silver bullets and attempt to track him, but this results in nothing more than a dead hunting dog and some wasted ammunition. Following this, the group fortifies itself inside the mansion to wait for their quarry to return, at which point they hope to be able to defeat him.

It consisted of eight berewicks and 25 hides of which 10 were free of geld and had the value of ¬£12. The area was subject to forest law for around a century to 1301, as part of Feckenham Forest. (page 120) Geography Chaddesley Corbett is centred on the north side of the A448 approximately midway between the north Worcestershire towns of Bromsgrove and Kidderminster. In 1913 the parish was stated to have just under 5% woodland, namely . Of this the main feature is Chaddesley Woods, which is recognised as a national nature reserve and lies to the east of the village. It is thought to be a remnant of the medieval Feckenham Forest. It is under the care of the Worcestershire Wildlife Trust, founded in 1968 to conserve, protect and restore the county's wildlife. The main section of the woods has a network of public footpaths to facilitate access.Surveyed in August 2008 for OpenStreetMap, Chaddesley Wood . Demography Chaddesley Corbett covers a relatively large 6,079 acres, that is and had a population of 1343 persons and 280 houses in 1821. The same area had a population of 1,440 persons across 607 households in 2001. Governance & religion Chaddesley Corbett parish is within the Wyre Forest District ward of Wyre Forest Rural, the Worcestershire County division of Chaddesley, and the parliamentary constituency of Wyre Forest whose MP since 2010 is Mark Garnier of the Conservative Party. It is within the Church of England Diocese of Worcester, the Archdeaconry of Dudley, and the deanery of Kidderminster; and the Roman Catholic province of Birmingham, the Archdiocese of Birmingham, and the deanery of Kidderminster. Landmarks =St Cassian's Church= St Cassian's Church from the lych gate. Within the village urban area is the Church of England church of St Cassian. The Domesday Book implies that there was a church at Chaddesley Corbett before 1086, although the present nave dates from the 12th century with later additions.Roper, John S., A History of St Cassian's Church Chaddesley Corbett,2006, The Friends of St Cassian's Church (May 2009), p.3 St Nicholas Chapel was added in the 13th century, the chancel and north and south aisles in the 14th century, and the vestry probably added in the 16th century when the south aisle and St Nicholas Chapel were also altered. The tower and spire were added in the 18th century and the north aisle widened and vestry altered in the 19th century.Roper, op. cit., p.36 The pipe organ, currently 3 manuals plus pedals, was first built in 1817 and relocated from a west gallery during major restoration and alterations in 1863-4. More recent additions include a roll of honour, housed in the tower, that lists those who served in World War I, and two windows commemorating soldiers killed during World War II.Roper, op. cit., pp. 19, 31 The monuments include former owners of Harvington Hall as well as members of the Corbett family, local lords of the manor and benefactors of the church. The fittings include a Norman stone font, which is thought to be the work of the Herefordshire School of sculptors, active c.1125‚Äì1150, which drew on Romanesque models from southern Europe. It features a main motif of interlaced dragons‚Äîsymbolising, perhaps, the evil of original sin which is washed away in baptism‚Äîwith other interlacing patterns along the rim and base. The dragons resemble Romanesque north Italian models, especially the pulpit of San Giulio abbey in Piedmont, but their interlacing is a motif of indigenous Anglo-Irish origin.G. Zarnecki, \\"Germanic Animal Motifs in Romanesque Sculpture\\", Artibus et historiae 22 (1990), pp. 189‚Äì203 The churchyard contains the war graves of 4 British Army soldiers of World War I and 2 Royal Air Force officers of World War II. =Harvington Hall= Harvington Hall near Chaddesley Corbett Harvington Hall, located in the hamlet of Harvington in the civil parish of Chaddesley Corbett, is a moated medieval and Elizabethan manor house. Harvington Hall is particularly notable for its vestment-hide and seven priest-holes, four of which are built around the main staircase and are thought to be the work of Nicholas Owen.Home > Corporate Hospitality > West Midlands , Hudson's .

Amenities The three village pubs, The Talbot, The Swan and The Fox were named in the 2007 Good Beer Guide. There is also a post office and general store, a butcher, hairdresser and beauty salon, a flower shop, delicatessen and a GP surgery. Education There are two schools in the village: Chaddesley Corbett Primary School and the independent Winterfold House School. The primary school caters for Reception to Year 6 and replaced the previous Chaddesley Corbett Endowed First School under the Wyre Forest education review. Each school has an associated pre-school nursery. Sport Chaddesley Corbett Sports Club is located in Fox Lane and has rugby, football and cricket sections, all of which play in one or more local leagues. The cricket club is one of the oldest cricket clubs in Worcestershire having been established in 1862. The football team also known as Chaddesley Ravens have two adult teams, as well as a junior section. The club was established in 1906. The village is the location for the Lady Dudley Cup, a point to point race that was first run in 1897.

Traditionally the Newton‚ÄìEuler equations is the grouping together of Euler's two laws of motion for a rigid body into a single equation with 6 components, using column vectors and matrices. These laws relate the motion of the center of gravity of a rigid body with the sum of forces and torques (or synonymously moments) acting on the rigid body. Center of mass frame With respect to a coordinate frame whose origin coincides with the body's center of mass, they can be expressed in matrix form as: : \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} {\\\\mathbf F} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\tau} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} m {\\\\mathbf I_3} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & {\\\\mathbf I}_{\\\\rm cm} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf a_{\\\\rm cm} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega} \\\\times {\\\\mathbf I}_{\\\\rm cm} \\\\, {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right), where :F = total force acting on the center of mass :m = mass of the body :I3 = the 3√ó3 identity matrix :acm = acceleration of the center of mass :vcm = velocity of the center of mass :œÑ = total torque acting about the center of mass :Icm = moment of inertia about the center of mass :œâ = angular velocity of the body :Œ± = angular acceleration of the body Any reference frame With respect to a coordinate frame located at point P that is fixed in the body and not coincident with the center of mass, the equations assume the more complex form: : \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} {\\\\mathbf F} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\tau}_{\\\\rm p} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} m {\\\\mathbf I_3} & -m [{\\\\mathbf c}]^{\\\\times}\\\\\\\\\\\\ m [{\\\\mathbf c}]^{\\\\times} & {\\\\mathbf I}_{\\\\rm cm} - m[{\\\\mathbf c}]^{\\\\times}[{\\\\mathbf c}]^{\\\\times}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf a_{\\\\rm p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\alpha} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} m[{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega}]^{\\\\times}[{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega}]^{\\\\times} {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {[\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega]}^\\\\times ({\\\\mathbf I}_{\\\\rm cm} - m [{\\\\mathbf c}]^\\\\times[{\\\\mathbf c}]^\\\\times)\\\\, {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right), where c is the location of the center of mass expressed in the body-fixed frame, and : [\\\\mathbf{c}]^{\\\\times} \\\\equiv \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} 0 & -c_z & c_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_z & 0 & -c_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ -c_y & c_x & 0 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad [\\\\mathbf{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}}]^{\\\\times} \\\\equiv \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} 0 & -\\\\omega_z & \\\\omega_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\omega_z & 0 & -\\\\omega_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\omega_y & \\\\omega_x & 0 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) denote skew- symmetric cross product matrices. The left hand side of the equation--which includes the sum of external forces, and the sum of external moments about P-- describes a spatial wrench, see screw theory. The inertial terms are contained in the spatial inertia matrix : \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} m {\\\\mathbf I_3} & m [{\\\\mathbf c}]^{\\\\times}\\\\\\\\\\\\ m [{\\\\mathbf c}]^{\\\\times} & {\\\\mathbf I}_{\\\\rm cm} - m [{\\\\mathbf c}]^{\\\\times}[{\\\\mathbf c}]^{\\\\times}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right), while the fictitious forces are contained in the term: : \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} m{[\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega]}^\\\\times {[\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega]}^\\\\times {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {[\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega]}^\\\\times ({\\\\mathbf I}_{\\\\rm cm} - m [{\\\\mathbf c}]^\\\\times[{\\\\mathbf c}]^\\\\times)\\\\, {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\omega} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) . When the center of mass is not coincident with the coordinate frame (that is, when c is nonzero), the translational and angular accelerations (a and Œ±) are coupled, so that each is associated with force and torque components.

It was one of the \\"most important collective artist groups\\" in the Chicano art movement in California during the 1970s and the 1980s and continues to be influential into the 21st century. History =Founding and name= In 1969 Jos√© Montoya moved to Sacramento to pursue a master's degree at CSU Sacramento. He and newly hired staff member Esteban Villa, both who had been active in the Mexican American Liberation Art Front, a Chicano movement group founded in the San Francisco Bay Area by Montoya's brother Malaquias, became active and soon created a circle of artists and activists interested in political and cultural work. The Rebel Chicano Art Front (RCAF) was founded by Montoya, Villa, and student Ricardo Favela to foster the arts in the Chicano/Latino community, educate young people in arts, history and culture, promote political awareness, and foster support for C√©sar Ch√°vez and the United Farm Workers in the heavily agricultural Sacramento-Davis area. As to its name, one day when someone asked if the RCAF meant the \\"Royal Canadian Air Force\\", one of the artists humorously responded, \\"No, it means the Royal Chicano Air Force!\\" From that point on, the artists used the \\"Air Force\\" motif in their artworks, programs, and activities. =Activities= Through the organizational framework of a collective, artists and community members established a silk screen operation to create multiples of images promoting art, cultural activities, community events, and political action. The work of Jose Guadalupe Posada, a Mexican printer of the late 1800s and early 1900s, inspired the artists for this work. At the same time, with the example of the great Mexican muralists, the artists undertook mural painting to bring cultural images and history to a larger audience. The organization grew to the point where a need for a space for artists was planned. The RCAF established the Centro de Artistas Chicanos moving from temporary quarters in homes, garages and La Raza Bookstore to Holy Angels School at 7th and T Streets. Later, a space was established on Folsom Blvd. and finally a center on Franklin Blvd. These spaces allowed for continual meetings, planning of events, workshops, studio activity and freedom to work around the clock. First, Max Garcia took on the directorship, followed by Gina Montoya and Ricardo Favela. Thousands of posters were created over the years with designs from multiple artists. Murals were painted throughout Sacramento (many now painted over) as well as Chicano Park in San Diego and in Washington and Oregon. Through the university, Jose Montoya, Esteban Villa and, later, Ricardo Favela, taught a generation of young artists the techniques of silk screen, muralism, drawing, and painting. Jose Montoya went on to establish the Barrio Art Program, representing an effort to reduce barriers between the CSU campus and the Alkalai Flats community. The Barrio Art Program brought young people and senior citizens together with aspiring teachers in the University's teacher training courses to learn to integrate the arts with education. The program continues to this day at the Washington Neighborhood Center located in downtown Sacramento at 16th and D Streets. Other RCAF artists, like Juanishi Orosco, Armando Cid and Rudy Cuellar taught there as well as in other community settings. Armando Cid and Juan Cervantez became artist facilitators in the Arts in Corrections Program teaching art and bringing guest artists to adult inmates. The RCAF had also a history of bringing the arts to youth offenders within the California Youth Authority, specifically at the reform school known as the Preston School of Industry in Ione, CA. =Bookstore= Through the efforts of RCAF members and CSU students, Phillip \\"Pike\\" Santos and Louie \\"the Foot\\" Gonzalez, La Raza Bookstore was established in 1972. The absence of written works about or by Chicanos and Native Americans led to this effort. The Bookstore was established at 1228 F Street, Sacramento. Later a gallery was established and the name was changed to La Raza Bookstore/Galeria Posada (named in honor of Jose Guadalupe Posada). The RCAF was featured prominently over the years in exhibitions, but perhaps more importantly, it became the exhibition space for countless numbers of visual artists of national importance. This community bookstore and gallery became an active center for Chicano/Latino and Native American art, poetry and music. Following the administrative oversight by Phillip Santos, the bookstore has had as some of its directors: Josie S. Talamantez, Armando Cid, Tere Romo, Victoria Plata, Luis Chabolla, Marisa Gutierrez, Francisca Godinez and since 2008, Marie Acosta. La Raza/Galeria Posada is now occupying its sixth home in its 40+ years of existence. =Music= Through its work in organizing exhibitions, mercados, dances, and cultural celebrations, the role of music became an important component of the RCAF. Freddie Rodriguez established the Royal Chicano Air Force Band, an ensemble performing a variety of genres from cumbias to blues. The RCAF Band featured lead singer Gloria Rangel who was later joined by her sister Irma \\"Cui Cui\\" Rangel. The band performed throughout Northern and Central California. The effort was successful in crystallizing the sounds of the barrio and taking the message of the RCAF to the people. Freddie's RCAF Band created, wrote, and performed a Chicano rock opera \\"Xicindio\\" in 1980 at the Sacramento Community Theatre for a national conference of bilingual educators that was later aired on PBS. The band eventually broke up with Freddie Rodriguez remaining in Sacramento where illness took his life. Gloria Rangel also died shortly after the band broke up but had returned to Los Angeles. Irma Rangel continues to perform and record under her name. Others, most notably Jose Montoya and Esteban Villa continued to play corridos and ballads playing their guitars. With the arrival of maestro Rudy Carrillo, the quality of performance grew and original music was composed leading to the establishment of El Trio Casindio‚Äîa four or more sized ensemble. An album was recorded and released entitled \\"All Day Music\\". More on this below. =Joe Serna= Another important alliance came with the work of Joe Serna, Jr. Joe and his family had returned to Sacramento in 1968 from service in the Peace Corps in the mountains of Guatemala. His interest in political change was in his core. He had been a child in a farmworker family and his commitment to work with Cesar Chavez and the United Farmworkers came early. He joined with the RCAF to further that work. The RCAF embraced Joe and soon thereafter worked with him to carry out the work of organizing and engaging in local political campaigns leading to the election of the first Mexican American to the City Council in a century. Joe Serna taught political courses at CSUS and eventually worked for the Lieutenant Governor, Mervyn Dymally before he embarked on his own political career. He ran for and became a Sacramento city councilman. Later he became the mayor of Sacramento until his death by cancer in November, 1999. His wife, Isabel Hernandez, also an ardent member of the RCAF circle since the 1970s died a year after Joe from cancer as well. =Impact= Members of the RCAF have worked as educators in all levels of education: elementary, high school, community college and university; they have taught in prisons, youth correctional facilities, neighborhood community centers and cultural facilities. They have served as artists in residence for the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission (SMAC) and the California Arts Council. They have served as board members and trustees of many arts organizations including La Raza Galeria Posada, the SMAC, the San Francisco Arts Commission, the Western States Arts Federation, the Concilio de Arte Popular and the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of the National Museum of the American Latino.The Royal Chicano Air Force Two special major collections of RCAF posters have been donated by Ricardo Favela to the CSU Sacramento Archives and Special Collections Department and to CSU San Jose. These Favela collections will provide academics, researchers and community members a valuable visual art resource for the future. The majority of their other posters, photographs, personal papers and organizational materials have been donated by Favela and various members of the RCAF to the California Ethnic and Multicultural Archives at the Donald Davidson Library at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Colecci√≥n Tloque Nahuaque. Promotional activities The RCAF began operating out of the Washington Neighborhood Center and frequently held events at Sacramento's Southside Park. To fund their activities and to support the farmworkers, they held dances, performances, and other fundraisers, for which they created promotional posters that visually incorporated the themes of the Chicano Movement. They also received funding support from the Washington Neighborhood Center and California State University, Sacramento. The RCAF painted murals throughout Sacramento, as well as several in San Diego's Chicano Park and one in Burley, Idaho. Community art workshops included the Barrio Art Program and the Anciano Art Project, for children and the elderly, respectively. For high school and college students, there were workshops in silkscreening and muralism. The members of the RCAF did not restrict their activities to the arts. Inspired by the free breakfast programs of the Black Panther Party, they and other activists such as Jennie Baca and Rosemary Rasul implemented the Breakfast for Ni√±os program for impoverished schoolchildren in the Sacramento area. Members of the RCAF also established a book store that would become La Raza Bookstore that would eventually be known as La Raza Galeria Posada still operating in Sacramento. The RCAF, under the directorship of Gilbert Gamino, ran an automotive repair cooperative called Aeronaves de Aztl√°n. Cultural activities The RCAF organized cultural activities such as a yearly poetry readings called \\"Flor y Canto\\", and revived indigenous Mexican practices such as celebrations of harvest (\\"Fiesta de Ma√≠z\\") and the rainy season (\\"Fiesta de Tlaloc\\"). Tere Romo, who worked with the RCAF to re-establish the D√≠a de los Muertos celebration in Sacramento in 1975, said that they had \\"an Indigenous ceremony with dance offerings, along with a Catholic mass, because there were a lot of older, traditional people there, and it's a holy day of obligation for Catholics.\\" They soon established the Centro de Artistas Chicanos, a workshop for the production of posters for community events. There, thousands of posters were created over the years. Out of all this activity came the music of the Royal Chicano Air Force Band established by Freddie Rodriguez and featured the vocals of Gloria Rangel and Irma Rangel. Eventually, Esteban and Jose established the Trio Casindio under the strong mentorship of Rudy Carrillo. Their first recording, All Day Music, was released in 1985. In 1995, Steve LaRosa and KVIE-TV, a public television station in Sacramento produced a film on the RCAF. Entitled, \\"Pilots of Aztl√°n: The Flights of the RCAF\\", the film has been shown annually throughout the region. In 2008, KVIE produced a follow up DVD entitled, \\"The RCAF Flies Again\\". Awards In 2007, La Galeria de La Raza, San Francisco honored Juan Carrillo with the Premio Galeria for his contributions to the Latino arts community. In 2010, the RCAF was honored by the National Association of Latino Arts and Culture (NALAC) for Lifetime Achievements at its national conference in San Jose, Ca. In May, 2011, Jos√© Montoya was honored at a Sacramento concert at C√©sar Ch√°vez Plaza as one of the \\"Fathers\\" of the Chicano Art Movement. Recent events The collective continues to operate presenting group and individual art exhibits while Villa and Montoya have added recordings to their repertoire. Recent exhibits of the RCAF members occurred at CSU Sacramento Library Gallery, 2007, Arte Americas in Fresno, 2008 and The Sacramento Central Library, 2009, the Brickhouse Gallery, La Raza Galeria Posada, Luna's Cafe and the Washington Neighborhood Center, all in Sacramento. Following his 2007 \\"heartaches & Jalapenos\\" CD release of original songs, Esteban Villa released his second CD of original music in 2010 entitled Habanero Honey. In June 2013 Villa's third CD, \\"Holy Mole!\\" was released. Prior to his death in 2009, Armando Cid was commissioned to restore his murals at the Washington Square Apartments. His family saw to it that the project was completed and installed. The unveiling took place in August, 2010. In the late summer, 2011, the RCAF members began to restore their murals located in Chicano Park, Barrio Logan, San Diego. Jose Montoya, Esteban Villa, Juanishi Orosco and Celia Hernandez were contracted as lead artists and were responsible for the work. Teams of artists including Sam Quinones, Danny Orosco, Domingo Orosco, Juan Manuel Carrillo, Carlos Lopez, Tomas Montoya, Maceo Montoya and Irma Lerma-Barbosa participated in the work. The City of Sacramento has begun negotiations with RCAF members to restore the ?Metamorphosis\\" mural on the city parking lot at 4th and L Streets. Stan Padilla, Esteban Villa and Juanishi Orosco will lead these efforts. To promote the forthcoming restoration, the City of Sacramento invited the three artists to exhibit their work in the Robert T. Matsui Gallery in City Hall beginning Dec 3 2014 running through Mar 3 2015. Another RCAF exhibit will occur in the Sacramento County Supervisors Chambers beginning Jan 25, 2015 and running for six months. Mujer C√≥smica Juanishi Orosco received a commission to paint \\"Capaces\\", a mural completely covering the four exterior walls at a Chicano service center in Woodburn, Oregon in the summer of 2013. The membership of the Royal Chicano Air Force additionally organize a scholarship fund, called the RCAF Memorial Scholarship, which awards 10 Sacramento Area students (as of the fundraising drive for the 2015 scholarship) each a $500.00 boost towards their continued educational goals. The scholarship is funded by donations from the current RCAF membership and the surrounding community, art shows, fundraisers, raffles and the like. The group is currently contemplating an online fundraising platform to allow the scholarship to be more accessible to qualified students. On September 25, 2013, Jose Montoya, the co-founder of the RCAF, died of a lymphoma on his aorta. He was 81. Read the article from the Sacramento Bee for a greater scope of his life and contributions. Jose was a \\"Respected Elder\\" of D.Q.U., and proud of his Indigenous blood. Sam Qui√±ones died of a heart attack early Friday morning, October 3, 2014 in Sacramento, CA. He was born in San Andreas, Calaveras County, CA. He attended CSU Sacramento and graduated with a degree in Communication Studies. He was an electrician and owned his own business. His contribution to the arts was through his decades of photographing and video taping arts and culture activities of the RCAF and other artists. He leaves his partner, Lucy Rhodes Montoya and a daughter from a previous marriage. Four days after Sam Qui√±ones died, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2014, Juan Cervantes died from complications arising from a quadruple bypass. He fought for over two weeks after his surgery, but his body ran out of the energy to survive. His life was about making art and teaching. He was a printmaker, a painter and a muralist. Raised in Roseville, CA, he went on to study artmaking at Sierra College and CSU Sacramento. He worked in the CA prison system for many years (as had many RCAF artists) before his work with high school and middle school students in Elk Grove. He is survived by three adult children. His early silkscreen posters are part of the Favela Collection at CSU Sacramento and CSU San Jose archives. His contribution to the RCAF mural in Southside Park, Sacramento, remains for all to enjoy.

The software team made the program flexible enough to be used not just for roads and rivers, but almost any kind of spatial data: provincial boundaries, power- station locations, satellite images, and so on. The program was named JUMP (JAVA Unified Mapping Platform), and it has become a popular, free Geographic Information System (GIS). After the initial creation and deployment of JUMP, regular development of the program by Vivid Solutions stopped. However, the company continued offering support to the user community that had grown around JUMP, and provided information to developers that had begun to improve JUMP in small ways, or who had customized it to fit their needs. Martin Davis and Jon Aquino, two former employees of Vivid Solutions that worked on the original JUMP, played a key role in the growth of this community centered on JUMP. It soon became evident that both the users and developers would benefit from a \\"unified\\" JUMP platform. This central or core platform would eliminate the compatibility issues that plagued the JUMP user community, and would give developers a platform on which to focus and coordinate their efforts. A number of the lead members from each team working with JUMP formed the JPP Development Committee, whose purpose was to guide and oversee this new unified platform. A name was chosen for this open source GIS program to be based on JUMP, \\"OpenJUMP\\". File formats One important feature of Jump and OpenJUMP is the ability to work with GIS data in GML format. GML or \\"Geography Markup Language\\" is an XML (text-based) format for GIS data. It is a way to describe spatial information in a human readable form, and is an accepted \\"open standard\\" for GIS data. OpenJUMP can currently read and write GML data, and the team hopes to develop a number of utilities that will improve OpenJUMP's ability to work with GML. The ability to work with an open format like GML is important to implementers because it gives alternatives to proprietary formats like Autodesk DWG files or ESRI Shapefiles. OpenJUMP nevertheless also reads and writes ESRI Shapefiles and supports ESRI ASCII grid format with an OpenJump plugin from the SIGLE team. While OpenJUMP is considered primarily a vector based GIS, it also supports rasters, as TIF files or the above ESRI ASCII grid.

Military career During the First World War, Colquhoun served in the Scots Guards. In 1914, the opposing troops on the Western Front had unofficially observed a Christmas truce. The following year, however, when the 28-year-old Captain Colquhoun agreed to a German officer's request for a short truce on Christmas Day, lasting about an hour, he was brought before a court-martial. He was defended by Raymond Asquith, son of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith (the Prime Minister was Colquhoun's wife's uncle). On 17 January 1916, he was found guilty after a five-hour trial, but received the lightest possible sentence, a reprimand. The sentence was remitted shortly afterwards by General Sir Douglas Haig, as Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, in view of Colquhoun's former distinguished conduct in the field.'The Private Papers of Douglas Haig 1914-1919', edited by Robert Blake (Pub. Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1952), P.124-126. By 1918 he was Commanding Officer of 2/4th Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment in 59th (2nd North Midland) Division. When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918, the division's forward defences were quickly overrun. 2/4th Leicesters had only just come out of the line after 24 hours of continuous trench duty, but were sent straight back up to assist in the defence. The battalion could get no further forward than the rear of the Battle Zone where the 'line' was no more than a yet-to-be-dug trench marked out with the turf removed and no barbed wire. The men extended along the line even though they were completely exposed in the open. Under the inspiring leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel Colquhoun and Regimental Sergeant-Major 'African Joe' Withers, the battalion held off the Germans for the rest of the day, with modest casualties.Middlebrook, pp. 251‚Äì2.Edmonds, pp. 228‚Äì34. Colquhoun was wounded during the war and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (1916) and Bar (1918) and a Mention in Dispatches. After the war he was Honorary Colonel of the 9th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and Glasgow University Officer Training Corps, and President of the Dunbartonshire Territorial Association.Burke's. Post-war He was Lord Lieutenant of Dunbartonshire from 1919 until his death, Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1932, 1940 and 1941 and Lord Rector of Glasgow University from 1934‚Äì1937. He was created a Knight of the Thistle in 1937. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1938 and resigned in 1942. Family Colquhoun was the son and heir of Alan John Colquhuon, 6th baronet, and his first wife, Justine Henrietta Kennedy.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage pg. 480 He succeeded his father as the 7th baronet in 1910, as Sir Iain Colquhoun of Luss and Chief of the Clan Colquhoun. Sir Iain married Geraldine Bryde (Dinah) Tennant (a granddaughter of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet) on 10 February 1915, and they had two sons (the elder succeeded his father as 9th baronet) and three daughters. One of their daughters, Fiona, a Segrave Trophy winner, married the 8th Earl of Arran (1910‚Äì1983), an Irish peer; the present 9th Earl is their son.

According to Jennifer Fisher, lyrical dance is ‚Äústrongly associated with clearly displayed emotional moods, fast-moving choreographic strategies, emphasis on virtuosic display, illustration of song lyrics, and, in group form, exact unison.‚Äù The style is usually danced at a faster pace than ballet but not as fast as jazz. Lyrical dance is a category typically found in dance competitions. History There is little research and documentation of the origins of lyrical dance most likely due to the limited use of this style outside of the competition dance world. There are three popular origin stories for lyrical dance that have been suggested by experts of competition dance. The first, speculated by Jimmy Peters, is that lyrical dance evolved from the \\"dream ballet\\" in musicals such as Oklahoma and West Side Story. The second from Chelya Clawson, states that this term can be traced back to 16th century traditional Indian dance. The last, and the most plausible, created by Phyllis Balanga- Demoret, is that it began about 25 years ago as a result of ballet's inability to take to the competition stage. Even though there has been no official documentation, Balanga-Demoret's explanation is the most plausible because lyrical dance is only used in competition dance. Additionally, ballet is rarely seen on a competitive stage, despite it having its own category at many competitions, which further confirms Balanga-Demoret's theory. Dancer, teacher, and choreographer Suzi Taylor, who holds regular classes at Steps on Broadway in New York City, is considered by many to be an early mother of lyrical dance, having emphasized a unique brand of musicality and expressiveness which influenced many future teachers and choreographers.Matisse Dance with Joyby Susan Goldman RubinDance Teacher, The Practical Magazine of DanceJones, Jen. \\"America'S Sweetheart.\\" Dance Spirit 13.9 (2009): 64-68. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 31 Jan. 2010. The styles within lyrical dance have changed over time. In the earlier stages, a dancer would perform the lyrics of a song, displaying emotions. Today, the lyrical category still has an emphasis on displaying emotion but in a more abstract way. The lyrical category is a place for innovation and stylized movement that is associated with contemporary dance. Lyrical dancing is performed to music with lyrics to inspire movements to express strong feelings and emotions the choreographer feels from the lyrics in the chosen song.What is Lyrical Dance? --About.com Because lyrical dancing focuses on the expression of strong emotion, the style concentrates more on individual approach and expressiveness than the precision of the dancer's movements.Lyrical Dancing --lovetoknow.com Because of this, there is not as much focus on the choreography, and, in fact, the choreography often exists only as a general guide for the dancer, not as a routine that has to be exactly followed. Style vs technique  Because of the links between the styles of dance, teachers originally struggled with whether to teach lyrical dance alongside jazz or ballet or as its own, separate style. The main concerns with lyrical dance is the distinction between lyrical as a style and/or a technique. Lyrical has been described as a \\"pseudostyle\\" or a \\"pseudogenre\\" because it utilizes steps from other, more established styles of dance. Lyrical dance utilizes training from jazz technique, ballet technique, and modern technique as a basis for movement. These well-known movements are elongated, taken off their center, and distorted to create a new aesthetic in lyrical. Although advertised by some studios as a class, ‚Äúlyrical technique‚Äù does not technically exist. A dancer cannot be proficient in lyrical dance without knowledge and mastery of basic technique from jazz, ballet, and modern. Use in popular culture Lyrical dance is competition dance style and is only used to describe a specific style of dance in the world of competitive dance. ‚ÄúLyrical‚Äù is used to describe a quality or movement type in other dance settings, but not as a style name such as Jazz or Ballet. There has only been one instance of lyrical being used in a professional setting. This was on Season 1 of the popular American dance show So You Think You Can Dance. Contestants on this reality show were asked to compete in many different styles such as ballroom, hip-hop, jazz, and lyrical. The term lyrical was replaced by the term contemporary in Season 2 of the show. This was thought to have been done to professionally legitimize this show. Despite the name change, the type of dances performed in this style remain very similar.

The station is served by the California Zephyr, Capitol Corridor, Coast Starlight, and San Joaquins. The station is listed as the connection point to San Francisco and Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach buses to and from the city connect every train serving this station. The station has one side platform and one island platform serving the eastern two tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad Martinez Subdivision. The other three tracks are only used by freight trains. A pedestrian bridge connects the side platform and station building with commercial areas on Shellmound Street to the west. History =Southern Pacific Railroad= Central Pacific Railroad completed the Berkeley Branch Railroad in 1876, followed by the mainline toward Richmond and beyond in 1878. Stations were located on the mainline at Emerys (Park Avenue), Shellmound, and Montague Street (now 59th Street), plus at San Pablo Avenue on the branch line. By the time the lines were under Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) control a decade later, the Montague Street station was gone and the Emerys (later Emery and Emeryvillle) stop had been moved a block south to Yerba Buena Avenue, where the line crossed the California and Nevada Railroad. The SP expanded suburban service with its East Bay Electric Lines subsidiary in 1911. Initial electric service to Berkeley mostly used the existing San Pablo Avenue station, with limited stops at Shell Mound, Emery, and B Street (34th Street); non-electric suburban service on the mainline stopped at Shell Mound. Additional branch lines and local stops were later added; by 1932, these stops included Powell Street and Folsom Street on the 9th Street line, and Green Street on the California Street line. The East Bay Electric Lines were closed in July 1941, ending passenger service to Emeryville. =Amtrak= A train at the under-construction station in May 1994 Oakland Central station, Amtrak's primary stop for Oakland (and San Francisco via connecting buses) was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. A new station was quickly constructed in nearby Emeryville - close to the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge - on the site of a former cement plant. Emeryville station opened on August 13, 1993, though construction was not completed until the next year. Oakland Central station closed on August 5, 1994; Emeryville was the only Oakland-area stop for Amtrak until the new Oakland ‚Äì Jack London Square station opened on May 22, 1995. The station became a centerpiece of redevelopment of formerly industrial areas of Emeryville. A footbridge connecting the station with parking lots and new development on the west side of the tracks was opened in 1997. The California Zephyr was re-extended to Oakland with the opening of the Jack London Square station in 1995. However, this required a complicated reverse move along street running tracks to reach the wye at West Oakland. The train was cut back to Emeryville on October 26, 1997. Bus connections Thruway buses at Emeryville station Because Emeryville is closer to the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge than Oakland ‚Äì Jack London Square station, it is the primary connection point between Amtrak trains and Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach bus service in the Bay Area. Thruway buses run between Emeryville station and downtown San Francisco, providing San Francisco connections for all trains. (However, Oakland is used for San Francisco connections for the southern leg of the Coast Starlight, as well as some Thruway routes that run along the coast to Southern California.) Several public transit bus lines also serve the station vicinity: *The free Emery Go-Round Hollis and Hollis South routes stop on Horton Street, across the street from the station, connecting to the Macarthur BART station. *AC Transit routes 36 and 57 stop on Shellmound Street, across the pedestrian bridge located at the station, while route 29 stops on Hollis Street one block east of the station.

In March 2008, he wrote for National Review Online, \\"[w]hat one can not say is that regime change in Iraq was unjustified: Not if you know Saddam‚Äôs record, his clearly stated intentions, and his ties to international terrorists‚Äîincluding, as a new Pentagon report reveals, a group headed by Ayman al-Zawahiri, now al Qaeda‚Äôs second-in- command.\\" In an April 2004 interview with Tavis Smiley, who alleged that Bush had decided to invade Iraq before the 9/11 attacks and manipulated intelligence on weapons of mass destruction, May argued that Bush had been continuing the policy of the Clinton-era Iraq Liberation Act and that Bush had pushed the CIA for accurate information. He also told Smiley, \\"I'm rooting for the guy in the White House, personally, 'cause I do think he has done a good job\\". In the aftermath of the American re-deployment in Iraq during July 2009, he wrote for The Washington Times, \\"[t]he news is not that American combat troops withdrew from Iraqi cities. The news is that American combat troops withdrew from Iraqi cities in victory‚Äîrather than in defeat.\\" May wrote for the San Angelo Standard Times in October 2012 that, despite the death of Osama bin Laden and other successes against al-Qaida, he considered the group \\"degraded\\" but not actually \\"defeated\\". He referred to the attempted assassination of Malala Yousafzai as a particular sign of a still dangerous Taliban. He argued, =Disputes, debates, and criticism= During the beginning of the 2003 CIA leak scandal, May wrote that an ex-administration official had told him that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent, and May stated that the fact was an open secret widely known across Washington, D.C. He also remarked that he chose not to mention this in his own writings since he considered this to be irrelevant to anything else. David Corn, writing for The Nation in March 2007 in the aftermath of the scandal, disputed May's assertions, and he quoted Plame as saying that only a handful of people knew about her covert status. Corn then called upon May, along with other conservative commentators such as Jonah Goldberg who had made similar statements, to apologize. On the October 15, 2007 edition of Tucker on MSNBC, May agreed with host Tucker Carlson's allegation that Hillary Clinton had used her gender to garner support in her Presidential campaign. May then jokingly referred to Clinton as a 'Vaginal-American'. The comment was highlighted by Media Matters for America.Cliff May on Sen. Clinton: \\"At least call her a Vaginal-American\\". Media Matters for America. Published October 16, 2007. Published July 21, 2009. In September 2007, Media Matters for America criticized May for making numerous public appearances in support of the Bush administration without mentioning his relationship with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's Advisory Committee on Democracy Promotion or the fact that the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies had received State Department monetary grants.Iraq war supporter Clifford May fails in media appearances to disclose State Dept. grants to organization he heads.

After Rush Limbaugh compared Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler in August 2009, Salon writer Glenn Greenwald stated on his blog that May had called Limbaugh's commentary \\"wrong, outrageous and damaging\\". May wrote at National Review Online shortly afterward that Greenwald had \\"[p]redictably\\" and \\"dishonorably\\" misrepresented the statement that he had e-mailed to Greenwald, which he said had criticized specious Nazi comparisons by both Limbaugh, Moveon.org, and Nancy Pelosi. On December 31, 2009, May jokingly suggested releasing detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Yemen, then sending \\"missiles to strike the baggage-claim area\\". He later defended the remarks, describing critics such as Greenwald as \\"humorless\\". He also stated that he had intended to highlight the logical disconnect between someone both supporting the extrajudicial killing of suspected militants and opposing the holding of suspected militants at Guantanamo Bay at the same time.

It lies on the Otava River, some to the south of the regional capital of Plze≈à. It has a population of about 11,000. Su≈°ice is also the seat of the Municipality with Extended Competence and with Commissioned Local Authority. It is also the founding place of the Solo match factory. History Su≈°ice originated most likely around the end of the 8th century as a settlement near the Otava River, a gold-mining area. In the 12th century was Su≈°ice owned by the Bavarian Counts of Bogen. It was re-connected to Bohemia by the Czech king Ottokar II of Bohemia in the 13th century and in 1273, it became a royal fortified town. During the Hussite Wars in the first half of the 15th century Su≈°ice was a Hussite town. After the battle on Bila Hora (White Mountain; 1620 ‚Äì the battle of the Czech aristocracy against the Habsburgs' monarchy) most of the properties were confiscated. The destruction of the town was finished by fire in 1707, when most of the sites burned down.

The earliest known Jewish community settled in Su≈°ice during the first half of the 17th century. The Jewish cemetery originated about 1626, with the last known Conservative or Progressive/Reform Jewish burial in 1874. A pogrom occurred in 1866. Jews moved to big towns in second half of 19th century. The 1930 Jewish population was 112.Jewish Families from Su≈°ice Present town population is 5,000‚Äì25,000 with no Jews.

It is narrower at the binding than at the ends, and allows for easier carved turns. A carved turn is a skiing term, used to refer to a turning technique in which the ski shifts to one side or the other on its edges. When edged, the sidecut geometry causes the ski to bend into an arc, and the ski naturally follows this arc shape to produce a turning motion. The carve is very efficient and allows the skier to maintain their speed, unlike older techniques like the stem Christie and parallel turns based on stemming which can create significant drag. Starting a carved turn requires the ski to be rotated onto its edge, which can be accomplished through small movements of the hips and knees. This motion is very easy to apply to both skis at the same time, and carving is a naturally parallel technique. Carving turns are generally much smoother and longer than stemming, and keeps the skis along the direction of travel as opposed to angled across it. Both of these reasons means that carved turns require far less effort than stemming for the same given amount of control over the descent. The technique was not simple to learn before the introduction of \\"shaped skis\\" in the 1990s. Since then, it has become common to teach carving as a form of parallel skiing, as opposed to the \\"classic\\" parallel technique.A basic explanation of the carving concept can be found in this . Note that the skier's body rotates along with the turn, and that snow is kicked up, when it is, along the entire length of the ski. In this companion video, , the difference between the classic skidding turn and carving is directly illustrated. Carved turns are now often used as a training technique for even the first-time skier, an example of this method can be found in the YouTube video on . Modern downhill technique is generally a combination of carving and skidding, varying the ratio between the two when rapid control over the turn or speed is required. Nevertheless, pure carving and pure stemming are used in certain circumstances. Pure carving is a useful technique on slopes of moderate steepness and smooth snow‚Äî\\"groomer carving\\" is widespread and there are skis dedicated to this style. However, competitive mogul skiing remains an almost pure parallel Christie technique, although the turn initiation is aided by the moguls themselves. History Shaped skis, also called parabolic skis, make carved turns possible at low speeds and with short turn radius. They were first developed in 1988 by Jurij Franko at the Slovenian ski company, Elan. With his colleague Pavel Skofic they organized a project dubbed SideCut Extreme and set out to build prototypes. The experiment proved immediately successful and the Elan factory ski team began winning almost every race they entered. In the US, ski instructors found that students could easily make parallel turns that would otherwise take considerable practice and training. The company put the ski on the market in 1993 as the Elan SCX. Shaped skis were almost unheard of until the early 1990s, when skiers began noticing certain advantages to the deeper sidecuts of snowboards, especially alpine snowboards, and the carving ability that this shape offered over the traditionally-shaped ski. Skis of this new shape have since become the common, and in many areas, the only kind of recreational ski available. The idea of shaped skis was formed by approaching the occurrence of skidding from a different perspective. Two basic assumptions were applied: that the ski would bend when edged (edging is the angling of the ski running base with the snow surface) only to the point where the ski's center came in contact with snow surface. The ski would not skid only when all the points of the edge of the ski traveled through the same point on the snow surface. If radius of a turn is chosen together with edge angle, calculation of sidecut (intersection of snow and ski surface) was relatively easy. The final result was radical parabolic sidecut. Dynamics This skier is in the middle of a high- performance turn during a slalom race. The arced shape of the ski can be seen, especially on the outside ski (right side of the image). When making a carving turn, a skier is skiing in dynamic equilibrium, so to balance the centripetal force the skier brings their center of mass to the inside of the turn. This is like a cyclist leaning to the inside of a turn to avoid being thrown off of their bicycle. Beginners to the sport are often hesitant to angulate into these turns, as they feel that such an action will cause them to fall. Ski instructors therefore teach new skiers to overcome this hesitation. The ski is made with a side-cut radius. This is the radius of a circle that would fit into the shape of the edge of the ski if viewed in plan-view. This is approximately the maximum radius of turn that can be cleanly carved. Expertly used skis are capable of carving clean circular arc segments whose approximate minimum radius is proportional to the cosine of the angle of tilt multiplied by the side-cut radius. Path Tracks of carved turns in the snow. Note the discontinuity in the curve where the skis switched from one edge to the other as the skier rotated their lower leg. Carving typically involves the skier making a series of \\"Cs\\", or half circles, down the hill (with two consecutive \\"C\\"s forming an \\"S\\"). Skidding turns on the other hand would rather follow a \\"Z\\"-shaped path. Some instructors teach their students to think of these half circles as a clock. For example, the most extreme left portion of a turn would be at 9 o'clock and the extreme right is 3 o'clock. The turns are accomplished by utilizing a \\"rolling\\" of both skis from edge to edge. Speed Recreational skiing is usually done at speeds in range between 5 m/s and 15 m/s with average turn radius of less than 15 m. Accordingly, sidecuts of modern recreational skis are calculated for turn radius of approximately 7 to 15 m. Unlike a skidding turn, which primarily uses the skidding effect to reduce speed (hence the \\"Z\\"-path), a (perfect) carved turn does not lose any speed because there is no braking action in the turns. Rather, the reduction of the average path slope angle resulting from the skier's S-shaped path down the slope, as opposed to a path straight down, reduces the skier's speed. The skier wishing to go slower must wait a little longer before initiating the next C-turn, making the \\"C\\" longer. This will lead the skier to ski more across the slope (in extremes uphill), reducing the average path slope angle. Snowboarding A carved turn is distinguishable by its subsequent \\"pencil line\\" mark left in the snow. This indicates that only the edge of the board made contact with the snow, and no skidding took place during the turn. The rider is using pressure, twist and tilt to get only the side of the board into the snow. Then engaging the sidecut edge which determines the carved turn shape. This type of turn causes the board to bend and store a large amount of potential energy during the turn. Allowing this potential energy to be released and then used to propel the boarder into the next turn. The act requires the snowboarding skills of twist, tilt, and pressure to engage the edge into the snow and start the turn. No pivoting should be involved while the edge of the board is engaged with the snow as it will cause skidding, or the edge to release from the snow.

By 1882, he was Rockefeller's closest associate, and typically acted as the company's primary spokesman. Rockefeller, after 1896, left business matters to Archbold while he pursued his philanthropy; as vice president, Archbold effectively ran Standard Oil until his death in 1916. Inspired by Rockefeller's policies, Archbold's main goals were stabilization, efficiency, and minimizing waste in refining and distributing petroleum products.

Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company began buying up refiners in this oil-rich region, many independent refiners felt squeezed out, and Archbold was among Standard's harshest and loudest critics. In 1885, after becoming skeptical of reports of oil discoveries in Oklahoma, he sold-out at a loss, saying \\"I'll drink every gallon produced west of the Mississippi!\\" Archbold was subsequently recruited by Rockefeller to Standard Oil, where he became a director and served as its vice-president and president until its dissolution in 1911.

Merchants without ties to the oil industry had pressed for the hearings. Prior to the committee's investigation, few knew of the size of Standard Oil's control and influence on seemingly unaffiliated oil refineries and pipelines - Hawke (1980) cites that only a dozen or so within Standard Oil knew the extent of company operations. The committee counsel, Simon Sterne, questioned representatives from the Erie Railroad and the New York Central Railroad and discovered that at least half of their long-haul traffic granted rebates, and that much of this traffic came from Standard Oil. The committee then shifted focus to Standard Oil's operations. John Dustin Archbold, as president of Acme Oil Company, denied that Acme was associated with Standard Oil. He then admitted to being a director of Standard Oil. The committee's final report scolded the railroads for their rebate policies and cited Standard Oil as an example. This scolding was largely moot to Standard Oil's interests since long-distance oil pipelines were now their preferred method of transportation. Archbold Stadium, Syracuse University = Syracuse University = In 1886, Archbold became a member of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, and was the board's president from 1893 until his death in 1916. From 1893 to 1914, he contributed nearly $6,000,000 for eight buildings, including the full cost of Archbold Stadium (opened 1907, demolished 1978; the Carrier Dome was built on this site), Sims Hall (men's dormitory, 1907), Archbold Gymnasium (1908, nearly destroyed by fire in 1947, but still in use), and the oval athletic field. 1912 political cartoon (Thomas E. Powers, US Library of Congress) = Theodore Roosevelt scandal = Archbold was involved in a scandalous affair involving monetary gifts to the Republican Party. In 1912, he was called to testify before a committee which was investigating political contributions made by the Standard Oil Company to the campaign funds of political parties. He claimed that President Theodore Roosevelt was aware of the $125,000 contribution made by Standard Oil Company to the 1904 campaign fund of the Republican Party, but President Roosevelt produced letters written by him which directed his campaign managers to return such monetary contributions if they were offered. = Assassination attempt = In 1915, an attempt was made by anarchists and Industrial Workers of the World radicals to assassinate Archbold at Cedar Cliff by planting a large dynamite bomb at the entrance to the estate.Steiner, Henry, The Other Oil Tycoon, River Journal Online, retrieved 20 July 2011 The bomb, which failed to go off, was discovered by Archbold's gardener.

It was published in 1976, sixteen years after the publication of the first novel. Plot Zia is the 14-year-old niece of Karana, the Native woman left behind on the Island of the Blue Dolphins in the previous book. Zia believes her aunt Karana to be alive, and with the help of her younger brother Mando, she sets out twice in an eighteen-foot boat on what are, ultimately, unsuccessful attempts at rescuing Karana. There is evidence on the island that she is still there, including small footprints in the sand, signs of cooking fires and the remains of huts. So then she goes to Santa Barbara to get an even better chance of finding her aunt. Captain Nidever sails to the Island of the Blue Dolphins to hunt otters, bringing Father Vicente with him to find Karana. Meanwhile, Stone Hands, planning an escape for himself and the other Indians living at the mission, gives Zia the key to the girls' dormitory room. She unlocks the dormitory, and Captain Cordova puts Zia in prison, believing she was the instigator of the escape. Captain Nidever returns with Karana and her second dog, Rontu-Aru. Captain Cordova and Father Vicente argue, and finally free Zia from prison. Zia and Karana can't communicate, although Karana appears to be settling into society. She learns to weave baskets as the other mission Indians do, loves melons and is fascinated by the horses, of which there were none on her island. Originally, Karana is assigned to sleep in the women's dormitory, but Rontu Aru is separated from her and chained up in the courtyard, as the priests believe he is bringing fleas into the dormitory. Karana, unaccustomed to the company of others and missing her dog, moves out to the courtyard. Father Merced becomes very ill and dies, and Father Vicente takes over. He lets the people sell the things that they make and allows them to keep the money. While Father Vicente is in charge of the mission, he goes with Karana and Zia to bring Stone Hands back from the canyon where the Indians tried to make a new home after they left the mission. When the church leadership sends Father Malatesta to be the new leader of the mission, Father Vicente leaves and goes to Monterey Bay. Stone Hands, Karana and the others do not like Father Malatesta. Karana leaves the mission not long later, when Father Malatesta does not allow her to sleep on the floor with Rontu-Aru. In the spring, Stone Hands and many of the Indians run away again because of the harsh treatment, and this time Mando leaves with him. Karana had been living in the same cave in which she and Mando had hidden the boat they found at the beginning of the book. On the day that Stone Hands and Mando leave the mission, Zia visits Karana again. She finds that Karana is very sick, but the priests at the mission will not help because Karana will not live there and work for the mission. In the morning, Karana dies. Zia then leaves the Mission and returns to her old home in the mountains with Rontu-Aru at her side. Historical elements Zia's aunt Karana, who was the main character of Island of the Blue Dolphins, is based on Juana Maria, a Nicole√±o woman who lived alone on an island for 18 years. Captain George Nidever was the name of the real person who brought Juana Maria from her island to a mission.

It is situated on the south shore fronting on the Northumberland Strait. The town was originally incorporated as a community on April 12, 1995, through the amalgamation of the town of Borden and the community of Carleton. The town of Borden opted to demote its status to a community in light of a declining tax base with the pending completion of the Confederation Bridge and the closure of the Marine Atlantic ferry service. Borden-Carleton became a town on July 31, 2012. History Borden traces its history to Prince Edward Island's requirements for transportation to mainland North America, whereas Carleton was a surrounding farming community to the north and west of the port. Borden's development is related to the fall of fortunes for another nearby community during the First World War. A winter iceboat service crossed the Abegweit Passage between nearby Cape Traverse to Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick for many decades during the 19th century and early 20th century. The Prince Edward Island Railway built a line from its mainline near Emerald Junction to the Cape Traverse wharf to facilitate this traffic in the 1880s. By the 20th century, the federal government began to face the reality of an unreliable winter iceboat service, which existed primarily due to the Dominion having failed to meet its obligation to provide \\"continuous steamship service\\" under the Prince Edward Island Terms of Union, when the province entered Confederation in 1873. As a result, the federal government announced in 1912 that it had commissioned the construction of a custom-designed railcar ferry, the SS Prince Edward Island at a shipyard in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The new ferry, to be operated by Canadian Government Railways (later merged into the Canadian National Railways system), was to operate from a new year-round port to be built at Carleton Point, several kilometres west of Cape Traverse; the harbour at Cape Traverse having been deemed unsuitable for a deep draught vessel due to siltation and the need for continuous dredging, despite being the most direct point on Prince Edward Island opposite Cape Tormentine. The SS Prince Edward Island arrived in the Northumberland Strait in 1915 during the early years of the war but the port at Carleton Point had not been constructed, so the vessel operated in year- round service out of Charlottetown and Georgetown from 1915 until the port at Carleton Point was ready. Meanwhile, the construction of the port and a modification of the Prince Edward Island Railway line between Emerald Junction to Cape Traverse required large amounts of equipment on land and water, as well as labourers. Some prisoners of war from the Central Powers that Canada and the Allies had jailed in the Maritimes were used in the railway construction, while the ferry pier and dock at Carleton Point was built using a large gantry constructed from Douglas Fir to sling armoured stone and pre- cast concrete caissons delivered by barge - some of which was salvaged from an abandoned wharf at nearby Tidnish, Nova Scotia for a marine railway that had been abandoned in the 1880s. The new port was commissioned in early 1917 when the SS Prince Edward Island began regular service from the new pier, carrying railway freight and passenger cars; she recorded 506 crossings to Cape Tormentine in that first year alone. The winter of 1917 saw a spectacular sight as dozens of houses and buildings that had been constructed in the port of Cape Traverse to the east were moved by horse and sleigh across the winter sea ice along the coast to the new port at Carleton Point. When the extension of the railway line to the new ferry port was completed, the remnant of the line running to Cape Traverse was abandoned. In 1919, the community was incorporated as the town of Borden, taking its name from Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden, whose government was responsible for the decision to locate the ferry terminal at Carleton Point. The area outside of Borden retained the community name of Carleton. Borden, or Port Borden, as it was frequently called, grew with the increased use of the ferry system. After the SS Prince Edward Island was modified by CNR in the 1920s to accept automobiles in addition to rail cars (after PEI legalized the use of automobiles), roads connecting to the port were improved. In 1931, another vessel, the SS Charlottetown, joined the SS Prince Edward Island in handling the increased rail and road traffic using the ferry service. Most workers for CNR's ferry and railway yard in Borden lived in the town. After the loss of the SS Charlottetown in 1941, the now-elderly SS Prince Edward Island remained the only dedicated vessel on the ferry service through the remainder of the Second World War, aside from brief relief service by the SS Scotia or SS Scotia II from the Strait of Canso railcar ferry service. In 1947, the QSMV Abegweit entered service and carried the ferry system through the 1950s but was quickly overwhelmed by the increase in automobile traffic, in addition to the constant rail traffic. The completion of the Trans-Canada Highway across PEI and the neighbouring Maritime provinces in the early 1960s saw Borden host a new automobile-only ferry, the MV Confederation, which was built in 1962. During the late 1960s, automobile traffic saw record growth. In 1968, CN stopped operating passenger trains on PEI, switching the service over to buses, and the ferry terminals and parking lots at Borden and Cape Tormentine were redesigned by CN to accommodate more cars and trucks; in Borden's case, part of its rail yard was used for this purpose, with the yard being redesigned in light of declining rail traffic and resulting in the town's original passenger station being demolished. Throughout the 20th century, and going as far back as the latter 19th century before a ferry service was instituted, there had been discussions by various politicians about replacing the ferry service with a permanent crossing. Early proposals envisioned a railway tunnel under the Northumberland Strait but these evolved by the causeway-building craze of the 1950s (coupled with the development of the Trans-Canada Highway) into designs incorporating a causeway and tunnel beneath a navigation channel to carry rail and road traffic. Discussions and proposals were timed around federal elections and work on the land-based approach roads in New Brunswick and PEI for one proposal was actually undertaken in 1965 before all talk of a permanent crossing was shelved in light of scientific recommendations against a causeway (for navigation and environmental reasons). The federal government instead opted to expand the capacity of the existing ferry system. The late 1960s saw a temporary relief vessel, the MV Lucy Maude Montgomery, enter service for several years, along with a much larger and more powerful icebreaking railcar ferry, the MV John Hamilton Gray, which entered service in 1968, retiring the SS Prince Edward Island after a record 51 years of service. New docks were constructed and more permanent vessels for the ferry service were ordered. In 1971 the sister ships MV Holiday Island and MV Vacationland entered service, and Borden processed record traffic on its ferry system in the lead-up to PEI's centennial year in 1973, after which the MV Confederation and MV Lucy Maude Montgomery were reassigned to other services and left Borden permanently. In 1977, CN reorganized its ferry services in eastern Canada under a separate operating company named CN Marine; the new company immediately ordered a newly designed ferry to replace the MV Abegweit, which reached 30 years service that year. The new vessel, originally named MV Straitway but renamed MV Abegweit (after the original Abegweit was renamed MV Abby prior to being retired), entered service in 1982 and was the largest capacity ferry vessel to operate from Borden. In 1986, CN Marine was renamed Marine Atlantic, to remove all traces of its link to the railway company. At the same time, discussion of a permanent crossing (a \\"Fixed Link\\" to the mainland) was revived by the federal government after it received several unsolicited proposals. CN abandoned all of its railway lines in PEI effective December 31, 1989, with the MV John Hamilton Gray hauling the last locomotives and cars off the Island on December 28. With the closure of the railway and the abandonment of the yard, the western side of Borden became an industrial brownfield during the early 1990s. In 1992, it was announced that the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project, or the \\"Fixed Link\\", would be built and a Calgary company, Strait Crossing Incorporated (SCI), had been selected as the developer. SCI secured the use of the old Borden Elementary School (which had been replaced several years earlier by the Amherst Cove Consolidated School on the northern edge of town) and undertook drill core sampling for bridge pier locations through 1993. In 1994, a farm property on Amherst Head, immediately east of Borden, was purchased and a staging facility was constructed for building massive bridge components on shore. A large pier was built into the harbour to accommodate a heavy lift marine crane which would carry the components into the Northumberland Strait to be installed. Throughout the 1994‚Äì1996 period, Borden's local economy grew at an unprecedented rate with the influx of over 5,000 workers in the town of 800. The longest-serving mayor of Borden was Gilbert Bell, who served from 1959 to 1986. =Confederation Bridge Project= The project was named Confederation Bridge and upon its opening on May 31, 1997, the ferry service closed after 70 years of daily operation; the vessels were transferred to other services or sold off and the ferry wharves, terminals and other shore-based facilities were decommissioned and dismantled. After the completion of the Confederation Bridge, Borden's economy shrank as the influx of workers left the town and province and as some of the laid-off or retired ferry workers moved away. The federal government provided \\"Fixed Link Adjustment Funds\\" which saw the development of a tourist shopping complex on the property of the former railway yard, which is now named \\"Gateway Village\\". The adjustment funding also paid for the expansion of the town's industrial park to accommodate new manufacturing interests and today the majority of Borden residents are employed in local manufacturing or service industries or in the tourism sector. Major employers include Master Packaging (a subsidiary of J.D. Irving Limited), Silliker Glass (a glass supplier and Kawneer Aluminum fabricator), and Transcontinental Printing (division of Transcontinental Media). There is an ongoing government effort to find a new use for the Amherst Head staging facility now abandoned by SCI since the completion of the Confederation Bridge construction project.

He was a nephew of William Courtenay, archbishop of Canterbury, and a descendant of King Edward I of England. From an early age he was renowned for his intellect and personal beauty. He was nicknamed \\"the flower of Devon\\".Was my ancestor King Henry V's lover?, Daily Telegraph, 7 April 2017; https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/king-henry-v-actually-gay/ Educated at Exeter College, Oxford, Courtenay entered the church, where his advance was rapid. He held several prebends, was Dean of St Asaph and then Dean of Wells, and became Bishop of Norwich in June 1413, being consecrated on 17 September 1413.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 262 As Chancellor of the University of Oxford, an office to which Courtenay was elected more than once, Courtenay asserted the independence of the University against Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1411; but the Archbishop, supported by King Henry IV and Antipope John XXIII, eventually triumphed. Courtenay was a close friend of King Henry V both before and after he came to the throne; and in 1413, immediately after Henry's accession, he was made treasurer of the royal household. On two occasions he went on diplomatic errands to France, and he was also employed by Henry on public business at home. Having accompanied the king to Harfleur in August 1415, Courtenay succumbed to dysentery and died about 15 September 1415. The closeness of the attachment has led to speculation that Courtenay may have played a critical role in mentoring Henry to become a respected monarch, and that his relationship with Henry may have been more than a friendship. Family Another member of this family was Peter Courtenay (died 1492), a grandnephew of Richard. He also attained high position in the English Church.

It closed in 1997. History The Reverend Philip Bennet Power and his wife, Emma, undertook the education of their own daughters at their Abbey Wood home, West Heath House. The quality of the girls' education attracted other local families to ask the Powers to teach their children and West Heath School thus opened in 1865. In 1879 the expanding school moved to 1 Ham Common, in what was then the agricultural community of Ham, Surrey. The house, set in over of grounds, was the former residence of the Duc de Chartres. In 1890 Misses Sarah, Maria and Anna Buckland and Miss Jane Percival who owned a similar school in Reading joined forces with the ageing Mrs Power at Ham Common and they ran the school until its purchase in 1900 by Misses Emma Lawrence and Margaret Skeat. Miss Elliott joined the staff in 1928 and was appointed Principal the following year. The development of nearby shops and housing prompted a second move, Ham having become \\"too suburbanised for a high class girls' school\\". In 1932 the school moved to its present site, the 18th-century Ashgrove House, near Sevenoaks, the former home of the Elliot family. The larger premises allowed the school to grow from its previous capacity at Ham of about seventy boarders, to over one hundred by the end of the Second World War. Diana, Princess of Wales, then Diana Spencer, attended the school from 1974 to 1977 and won an award as \\"the girl giving maximum help to the school and her schoolfellows\\". In addition to the Spencer sisters, Issy van Randwyck, Annabel Croft, Penelope Farmer, and Tilda Swinton were educated there. In the 1990s the school had financial difficulties due to falling numbers of pupils, and it was placed into receivership in 1997. Later use of the site The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund considered buying the school, but decided against it, and Mohamed Al Fayed stepped in to buy West Heath for ¬£2,300,000 on 20 May 1998 as new premises for the Beth Marie Centre. He later pledged to contribute a further ¬£550,000 towards equipping the school. In a statement, he said: :I am surprised that the Princess Diana Memorial Fund, with all its millions in the bank, did not show a greater interest in this project. I believe it to be a far more fitting tribute to her work than putting her name on tasteless souvenirs. The New School at West Heath, a special school, opened in the same premises on 14 September 1998, and was renamed as West Heath School in September 2015.

It has about 7,700 inhabitants. The town features a Renaissance-era St≈ô√≠bro Bridge. St≈ô√≠bro is also the seat of the Municipality with Extended Competence. Etymology The Czech name derives from silver (), which used to be mined there. The German name Mies comes from the name of the river Mies/M≈æe (). Geography The mining town is located on the M≈æe river in the west of the historic Bohemia region, some to the west from the region capital of Plze≈à. History According to the 16th century chronicler Wenceslaus Hajek, the mining settlement in the Duchy of Bohemia was founded by the P≈ôemyslid duke Sobƒõslav I in 1131. Located on an important trade route (Zlat√° cesta, \\"Golden Road\\") from Prague to Nuremberg, it was first documented in 1183, when Duke Frederick and his consort Elizabeth of Hungary dedicated the first parish church to the Order of Malta. In 1243 King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia left the commandry to the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star. Mies received town privileges in 1263. The Czech name St≈ô√≠bro is documented from the 14th century onwards. During the Hussite Wars, the town was besieged by the troops of Jan ≈Ωi≈æka in 1421, though it was not occupied until in 1427. Shortly afterwards, the Hussite forces under Prokop the Great could repel an attack by the Crusaders in the Battle of Mies. In 1541 the citizens turned Protestant. Silver mining was resumed under the Habsburg king Ferdinand I in 1554. Upon the Battle of White Mountain, the town was subdued to the measures of the Counter-Reformation. Until 1918, Mies in B√∂hmen (previously Mies) was part of the Habsburg Monarchy and of the Cisleithanian (\\"Austrian\\") side after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. It was the administrative centre of a district (Bezirk) with the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 From 1918, St≈ô√≠bro belonged to Czechoslovakia.

It was caused by the calling-up of reserve troops by Premier Antonio Maura to be sent as reinforcements when Spain renewed military-colonial activity in Morocco on 9 July, in what is known as the Second Rif War. Many of these reservists were the only breadwinners for their families, while the wealthy were able to hire substitutes. Background Minister of War Arsenio Linares y Pombo called up the Third Mixed Brigade of Cazadores (Light Infantry), which was composed of both active and reserve units in Catalonia. Among these were 520 men who had completed active duty six years earlier, and who had not anticipated further service. Many of the Cazadores, plus other reservists, were the only breadwinners for their families. One could hire a substitute if unable or unwilling to fight, but this cost 6,000 reales which was beyond the means of most laborers, who did not earn more than 20 reales or 5 pesetas a day, barely enough to sustain themselves and their families. Accordingly the well-off were better placed to legally avoid further service than members of the working classes. Finally, conscripted service in North Africa for the perceived benefit only of wealthy mining interests was deeply unpopular. The incident began when a party of conscripts, destined for Morocco, boarded ships owned by the marquess of Comillas, a prominent Catholic industrialist. The soldiers were the subject of patriotic addresses, the playing of the Royal March, and the distribution of religious medals by well dressed ladies. The conscripts remained silent but many of the onlookers jeered and whistled, and emblems of the Sacred Heart were thrown into the sea. Mary Vincent, Spain 1833 - 2002 p.103 General strike Barcelona during the Tragic Week. These actions, coupled with anarchist, anti-militarist, and anti-colonial philosophies shared by many in the city (Barcelona later became a stronghold for the anarchists during the Spanish Civil War), resulted in the union Solidaridad Obrera - directed by a committee of anarchists and socialists - calling a general strike against Maura's call-up of the reservists on Monday 26 July 1909. Although the civil governor √Ångel Ossorio y Gallardo had received ample warning of the growing discontent, acts of vandalism were provoked by elements called the j√≥venes b√°rbaros (Young Barbarians), who were associated with the Radical Republican Party (Partido Republicano Radical) of Alejandro Lerroux. Outbreak By Tuesday, workers had occupied much of central Barcelona, halting troop trains and overturning trams. By Thursday, there was street fighting, with a general eruption of riots, strikes, and the burnings of convents. Many of the rioters were antimilitarist, anticolonial and anticlerical. The rioters considered the Roman Catholic Church a part of the corrupt middle and upper class whose sons did not have to go to war, and much public opinion had been turned against the Church by anarchist elements within the city. Thus, not only were convents burned, but sepulchers were profaned and graves were emptied.Dolors Mar√≠n, \\"Barcelona en llamas: La Semana Tr√°gica\\", La Aventura de la Historia, A√±o 11, no. 129, p. 47. Of 112 buildings set fire to during the disturbances, 80 were church-owned or associated. After disturbances in downtown Barcelona, civil guards and police fired on demonstrators in Las Ramblas, resulting in the construction of barricades in the streets and the proclamation of martial law. The government declaring a \\"state of war\\", ordered troops to end the revolt. Working class conscripts recruited from Barcelona and already stationed in the city, were considered unreliable under the circumstances. Accordingly, other army units were brought in from Valencia, Zaragoza, Pamplona and Burgos. These ended the revolt, causing dozens of deaths. Aftermath Francesc Ferrer i Gu√†rdia Police and army casualties were 8 dead and 124 wounded, while 104 to 150 civilians were reportedly killed. More than 1,700 individuals were indicted in military courts for \\"armed rebellion\\". Five were sentenced to death and executed (including Francesc Ferrer, founder of the Escuela Moderna); 59 received sentences of life imprisonment. Alejandro Lerroux fled into exile. General European condemnation in the press was immediate. King Alfonso XIII, alarmed by the reaction at home and abroad, dismissed Premier Antonio Maura from power, replacing him with Segismundo Moret.  References  Sources * Carolyn P.

History The place was named on 27 November 1864 after the village of Nollendorf () near Petrovice in the present-day Czech Republic, a site of the 1813 Battle of Kulm where the united forces of the Sixth Coalition defeated a French army under Dominique Vandamme. The victorious Prussian troops were led by General Friedrich von Kleist, who in turn was elevated to a \\"Count of Nollendorf\\" by King Frederick William III. The adjacent Kleiststra√üe leads from Nollendorfplatz to Wittenbergplatz in the west. Nollendorfplatz with Neues Schauspielhaus (twin-turrets) and steeple of the American Church, about 1903 The extended square was laid out according to the Hobrecht-Plan of 1862, then part of a larger road link from Charlottenburg through Sch√∂neberg to the Berlin district of Kreuzberg in the manner of a Parisian boulevard, named after victorious Prussian generals (therefore colloquially called Generalszug in German). During the Wilhelmine era, in 1902, the first Berlin U-Bahn line (Stammstrecke) was inaugurated, which ran under the Kleiststra√üe pavement up to the elevated railway at Nollendorfplatz station, built according to plans designed by Cremer & Wolffenstein architects. Gay village Severely damaged by the bombing of Berlin in World War II, the square today is shaped by the rebuilt U-Bahn viaduct and the facade of the historic Neues Schauspielhaus theatre, supplemented by numerous new buildings. The adjacent area in the south around Motzstra√üe is Berlin's most prominent gay village and site of the annual Lesbian and Gay City Festival. Pink Triangle memorial Nollendorfplatz has a long history as being a gay area which dates back to the turn of the 20th century, perpetuated by The Berlin Stories of Christopher Isherwood, the writings of W. H. Auden, Klaus Mann, and many others. Within the gay community this part of Berlin is most famous for its leather and darkroom bars. It also plays a little role in the musical Cabaret by Joe Masteroff as the home of some of the characters.

Origins Courtenay was the third son of Sir Philip Courtenay (d. 1463) of Powderham by Elizabeth Hungerford, daughter of Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford (d. 1449), by his first wife Catherine Peverell, daughter of Sir Thomas Peverell, MP, of Parke and Hamatethy, Cornwall.History of Parliament biography of \\"HUNGERFORD, Sir Walter (1378-1449), of Farleigh Hungerford, Som. and Heytesbury, Wilts.\\" He was a grandson of Sir Philip Courtenay (d. 1406) of Powderham, a younger son of Hugh Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon (d. 1377). Courtenay was also a grand-nephew of Richard Courtenay (d. 1415), Bishop of Norwich, and a great-grand-nephew of William Courtenay (d. 1396), Archbishop of Canterbury. He came from a family of six brothers and four sisters..

By April 1461 he was studying law at the University of Padua,Jonathan Woolfson, Padua and the Tudors: English Students in Italy, 1485-1603, James Clarke & Co, 1998, p. 4. where he was elected rector.. Courtenay enjoyed ecclesiastical preferment from 1448 on.; . Among other appointments he was made Archdeacon of Exeter on 8 June 1453, prebendary at Lincoln in 1483, Archdeacon of Wiltshire in 1464, Master of St. Anthony's Hospital, St Benet Fink in the City of London in 1470,Victoria County History, Volume 1, London Within the Bars, Westminster and Southwark, ed.

On 14 June 1478 Courtenay was elected Bishop of Exeter,. with papal provision taking place on 9 September 1478. He received his temporalities on 3 November, and was consecrated on 8 November at St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster.; . Courtenay's ecclesiastical career ran side by side with involvement in the political affairs of the day. By June 1462 he had left Padua and was back in England, where he entered the service of King Edward IV, and was sent by the King to offer the Duke of Milan the Order of the Garter. In November 1463 he acted as the King's proctor in the papal curia. However, in 1470 both he and his elder brother, Sir Philip Courtenay, had joined King Edward's brother, the Duke of Clarence, in opposition to the King. Courtenay accommodated himself to the Lancastrian regime during the readeption, serving as secretary to King Henry VI. However, in 1471 he rejoined Clarence, and by March 1472 was secretary to Edward IV, who had taken back the throne. Courtenay was still serving as King Edward's secretary in May 1474, and appears to have become a member of the King's council in 1477‚Äì8.. After the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, Courtenay initially supported the new King, Richard III.. However, in the fall of 1483 both he and his younger brother, Walter Courtenay (d. 7 November 1506), attempted to incite a rising in Devon and Cornwall on behalf of Henry Tudor, the future King Henry VII. The rising failed, and Courtenay fled to the continent, joining Tudor in exile at Vannes, Brittany. In January 1484 he was attainted by Parliament, and his temporalities were forfeited. Courtenay accompanied Henry Tudor on his return to England, and after the victory at Bosworth and the death of Richard III, was made Keeper of the Privy Seal on 8 September 1485, and was one of the bishops who officiated at the new King's coronation. His attainder was reversed by Henry VII's first Parliament, and on 29 January 1487 he was translated to become Bishop of Winchester.; . Courtenay continued to play a political role until his death, being present at the ratification of a treaty with Spain on 23 September 1490 and the creation of the King's eldest son, Arthur, as Prince of Wales on 29 November 1491. Courtenay died on 23 September 1492, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral.; . Shakespeare and Peter Courtenay, Bishop of Exeter Courtenay's rising against Richard III is mentioned in Act IV Scene iv of Shakespeare's Richard III, although Shakespeare erroneously refers to Sir Edward Courtenay, the Bishop's cousin, as his brother: Mess.

A flat-eight engine which uses a boxer configuration, where each pair of opposed cylinders moves inwards and outwards at the same time, is called a boxer-eight engine. Flat-eight engines are less common than V8 engines, however they have been used at times in automobiles, including various Porsche racing cars through the 1960s. They have also occasionally been used as aircraft and marine engines.  Design  The advantages of a flat-eight engine are its minimal length and low centre of mass. A disadvantage is its greater width compared to a V8 or inline-eight engine. A flat-eight engine is able to have perfect primary balance and secondary balance. A boxer-eight engine has a single piston per crankpin, which increases the offset between the cylinder banks. A boxer-eight with nine main bearings may be thought of as two boxer-four engines laid end-to-end with a 90¬∞ phase angle between their crankshafts. Alternatively, a flat-eight engine where corresponding pistons from the two opposing banks share a crankshaft journal is often called a \\"180 degree V engine\\". One possible configuration for this design is to use a two-plane crankshaft. Another configuration is to use a 180¬∞ single-plane crankshaft with the leading and trailing crankpins in the same position, while the two central crankpins are in the opposite position.  Use in automobiles  Buffum Model G Greyhound One of the earliest flat-eight engines was used in the 1904 Buffum Model G Greyhound racing car, which used an engine based on two of Buffum's existing flat-four engines joined together.. The Model G was built in the United States and was introduced one year after the Winton Motor Carriage Company Bullet No. 2, which used a straight-8 engine. Around the same time, the first V8 engines were beginning to appear in Europe. Several racing cars have used bespoke flat-eight engines based on two inline-four engines and a custom crankshaft. These include the 1928 Anderson Specials Number 2 built in Scotland using two Humber 9/20 engines. The car is on display at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. Another example is a 1977 Eagle 72 chassis raced by Bruce Crower in the United States. This engine used the cylinder heads from two Chevrolet Cosworth Vega engines. In 1969, a one-off engine was built for racing driver Emerson Fittipaldi to compete in the Thousand Miles of Guanabara endurance race. This flat-eight engine was made by joining two 1.3 L Volkswagen flat-four crankcases with an elastomeric gasket and connecting the two crankshafts together. Several similar Volkswagen-based engines were built for Fittipaldi's racing cars in the early 1970s. = Porsche = Porsche 771 engine Porsche used flat-eight engines in various racing cars throughout the 1960s. The first Porsche flat-eight was the Type 753. Work began on it in 1960, following the announcement of a displacement limit for the 1961 Formula One season. Designed by Hans Mezger and Hans Honich, the engine includes features shaft-driven double-overhead camshafts, a two-piece magnesium crankcase casting, eight individual finned cylinder barrels, a solid crankshaft running in nine main bearings and Lucas electronic ignition. The version of the Type 753 used for its debut at the 1962 Dutch Formula One Grand Prix produced . At the 1962 French Grand Prix, the Type 753 engine delivered Porsche's only F1 race win as a constructor, in an 804 driven by Dan Gurney. The 753 also influenced the design of the flat-six engine used in the first- generation Porsche 911. A version of the Porsche flat-eight, designated the Type 771, was developed alongside the Type 753. This engine was intended for sports car and endurance racing, and was used in the Porsche 718 W-RS, Porsche 904/8), Porsche 906, Porsche 907, Porsche 909 and Porsche 910 racing cars between 1962 and 1968. A version of the Type 771 enlarged to was designated Type 771/1. In 1968, a new flat-eight engine called the Type 908 was introduced in the Porsche 908, which competed in the Group 6 Prototype-Sports Cars category. The Type 908 was not based on the Type 771, but instead the Type 916 flat-six racing six-cylinder engine with two additional cylinders. Porsche also installed Type 908 engines into two Porsche 914/8 mid-engined road cars. The first of these was a concept study built by the head of the racing department, and the second was built as a 60th birthday present for the company chairman. Although Porsche never produced any road cars with a flat- eight engine, a prototype of such an engine was built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this time, Posche had been commissioned by Volkswagen to develop \\"Project EA266\\", a replacement for the Volkswagen Beetle. Project EA266 was powered by a water-cooled inline-four engine which was mounted longitudinally under the rear passenger seat with the cylinders oriented horizontally. Porsche investigated using the Project EA266 chassis as the basis for a mid-engined replacement for the Porsche 911 called the \\"Typ 1966\\". As part of the Typ 1966 development process, a prototype water-cooled flat- eight engine was built. However, Project EA266 was cancelled by Volkswagen, all materials relating to the Typ 1966 were destroyed, including the prototype flat-eight engine.  Use in aircraft  Jabiru 5100 aircraft engine Several flat-eight aircraft engines have been produced over the years: * 1961-present Lycoming IO-720. Air-cooled, * 1969-1975 Continental Tiara 8-380 (O-540) and T8-450 (O-540). Air-cooled, * 1997-200? Jabiru 5100. Air-cooled, * 2013-???? Engineered Propulsion Systems Vision 350. Turbo-diesel, water-cooled,  Use in marine vessels  Flat-eight engines are seldom used in marine applications, with the 1957 Fageol VIP 88 outboard engine being a rare example of a production engine. The VIP 88 consisted of two Crosley engine blocks joined on a common crankshaft. Another marine engine was the one-off Miller 148 marine engine which was built in 1928 and used in the racing boat Miss Rioco III. The Miller 148 had dual overhead camshafts and a displacement of .

There is considerable variation in the expression of definiteness across languages and some languages do not express it at all. For example, in English definiteness is usually marked by the selection of determiner. Certain determiners, such as a, an, many, any, either, and some, typically mark an NP as indefinite. Others, including the, this, every, and both, mark the NP as definite. In some other languages, the marker is a clitic that attaches phonologically to the noun (and often to modifying adjectives): the Hebrew definite article ha- or the Arabic definite article al-. In yet other languages, definiteness is indicated by affixes on the noun or on modifying adjectives, much like the expression of grammatical number and grammatical case. In those languages, the inflections indicating definiteness may be quite complex. In the Germanic languages and Balto-Slavic languages, for example (as still in modern German and Lithuanian), there are two paradigms for adjectives, one used in definite noun phrases and the other used in indefinite noun phrases. In some languages, such as Hungarian, definiteness is marked on the verb. Use in different languages Examples are: * Phrasal clitic: as in Basque: Cf. (\\"woman\\"), (woman-ART: \\"the woman\\"), (woman beautiful-ART: \\"the beautiful woman\\"); Romanian: (\\"man\\"), (man-ART: \\"the man\\"), (man-ART good: \\"the good man\\") or (good-ART man: \\"the good man\\") * Noun affix: as in Albanian: (\\"boy\\"); (djal-ART: \\"the boy\\"); (djal-ART i madh: \\"the elder son\\"); (\\"girl\\"); (vajz-ART: \\"the girl\\"); (vajz-ART e bukur: \\"the pretty girl\\") * Prefix on both noun and adjective: Arabic (al-kitƒÅb al-kabƒ´r) with two instances of al- (DEF-book-DEF-big, literally, \\"the book the big\\") * Distinct verbal forms: as in Hungarian: (read-1sg.pres.INDEF a book-ACC.sg: \\"I read a book\\") versus (read-1sg.pres.DEF the book-ACC.sg: \\"I read the book\\") Germanic, Romance, Celtic, Semitic, and auxiliary languages generally have a definite article, often preposed but in some cases postposed. Many other languages do not. Some examples are Chinese, Japanese, Finnish, and modern Slavic languages except Bulgarian and Macedonian. When necessary, languages of this kind may indicate definiteness by other means such as demonstratives. It is common for definiteness to interact with the marking of case in certain syntactic contexts. In many languages, a direct object receives distinctive marking only if it is definite. For example, in Turkish, the direct object in the sentence (meaning \\"I saw the man\\") is marked with the suffix (indicating definiteness). The absence of the suffix on a direct object in Turkish means that it is indefinite and, in the absence of the indefinite article , no longer explicitly singular: (\\"I saw a man/I saw men\\"), . In Serbo-Croatian, in the Baltic languages Latvian and Lithuanian, and, to a lesser extent in Slovene, definiteness can be expressed morphologically on prenominal adjectives. The short form of the adjective is interpreted as indefinite, while the long form is definite or specific: * short (indefinite): Serbo-Croatian \\"a new city\\"; Lithuanian \\"a white book\\" * long (definite): \\"the new city, a certain new city\\"; \\"the white book, a certain white book\\" In some languages, the definiteness of the object affects the transitivity of the verb. In the absence of peculiar specificity marking, it also tends to affect the telicity of mono-occasional predications. Morphological marking of definiteness In some languages definiteness can be seen a morphological category of nouns. For example, in some Scandinavian languages, such as Swedish, definite nouns inflect with a dedicated set of suffixes. This is known in Swedish as the grammatical category of Species. In Semitic languages the category of state is sometimes tied to definiteness, as some Semitic languages are said to distinguish between three morphological states: Indefinite (Absolute) State, Definite (Emphatic) State, and Construct State. Such a system exists for instance in Old Aramaic. Yet in other Semitic languages, like Hebrew or Arabic, definiteness is marked by a pro-clitic, and the state category relates only to the question whether a nominal is necessarily modified by a complement (and is thus in the construct state) or not (being in the free state).

Bishop Copleston by Martin Archer Shee. Edward Copleston (2 February 177614 August 1849) was an English churchman and academic, Provost of Oriel College, Oxford from 1814 till 1828 and Bishop of Llandaff from 1827. Life Born into an ancient West Country family, Copleston was born at Offwell in Devon, and educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to which he gained a scholarship at the age of 15. He was elected to a tutorship at Oriel College, Oxford in 1797, and in 1800 was appointed to St Mary Hall, Oxford and also became Vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford. As Oxford Professor of Poetry (1802‚Äì1812) he gained a reputation by his literary criticism and sound latinity. After holding the office of dean at Oriel for some years, he succeeded to the provostship in 1814, and owing largely to his influence the college reached a remarkable degree of prosperity during the first quarter of the 19th century. He was influential in the choice of Fellows who were in due course to become prominent during the Oxford Movement, though he himself was of a more rationalist cast of mind and belonged to the group of so-called Oriel Noetics. In 1826 he was appointed Dean of Chester, and in the next year he was consecrated Bishop of Llandaff. Here he gave his support to the new movement for church restoration in Wales, and during his occupation of the see more than twenty new churches were built in the diocese. The political problems of the time interested him greatly, and his writings include two letters to Sir Robert Peel, one dealing with the 'Variable Standard of Value', the other with the 'Increase of Pauperism' (Oxford, 1819). The palace of the Bishops of Llandaff (at Mathern, Monmouthshire) had been sold so Copleston resided occasionally at Llandough Castle near Cowbridge and passed his later life between the Deanery of St.Paul's and Hardwick House in Chepstow, where he died. His great-grandson, John Copleston, was also a clergyman.

Reynolds Tobacco Company in the United States and British American Tobacco elsewhere. The brand is named after Herbert Kent, a former executive at Lorillard Tobacco Company. History An old pack of Kent Ultras from South Africa Widely recognized by many as the first popular filtered cigarette, Kent was introduced by the Lorillard Tobacco Company in 1952 around the same time a series of articles entitled \\"cancer by the carton\\", published by Reader's Digest, scared American consumers into seeking out a filter brand at a time when most brands were filterless. (Viceroy cigarettes had been the first to introduce filters, in 1936.) Kent widely touted its \\"famous micronite filter\\" and promised consumers the \\"greatest health protection in history\\". Sales of Kent skyrocketed, and it has been estimated that in Kent's first four years on the market, Lorillard sold some 13 billion Kent cigarettes. From March 1952 until at least May 1956, however, the Micronite filter in Kent cigarettes contained compressed carcinogenic blue asbestos within the crimped crepe paper. It has been suspected that many cases of mesothelioma have been caused specifically by smoking the original Kent cigarettes, and various lawsuits followed over the years because of it. Lorillard quietly changed the filter material from asbestos to the more common cellulose acetate in mid 1956. Kent continued to grow until the late 1960s, then began a long, steady decline as more filtered cigarette brands promising even lower tar (and appealing to smokers' desires for a \\"safer\\" smoke) were introduced. However, Kent continued to stay in the top ten cigarette brand list until 1979. In 1977, Lorillard sold the overseas rights of Kent and all of its other brands and today Kents manufactured outside the U.S. are property of British American Tobacco. In the 1970s, British American Tobacco bought the brand and started selling it outside of the U.S, eventually making it one of their most popular brands along with Dunhill, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans. On June 15, 2014 Reynolds American offered to buy the Lorillard tobacco company for $27.4 billion and effective June 12, 2015 the Kent brand became the property of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Various advertising posters were made for Kent cigarettes, ranging from 1955 until 1986. Kent in Romania Between 1970 and 1990 Kent was the most demanded cigarette in Romania and in some parts of the domestic market used as payment or bribe. In the latter part of the interval, Kent was no longer available in regular retail, being sold officially only in hard currency shops. Obviously, the black market was thriving at the time, as most Kents being smuggled in by those relatively few Romanians who were allowed to travel abroad (sea and air crew, diplomatic staff, etc.)In Romania, Smoking A Kent Cigarette Is Like Burning Money and In Romania, Kent Cigarettes are Very Useful As A Bartering Medium , The Wall Street Journal: March 1, 1986 Kent in Vietnam Among the migrant worker community of English teachers in Vietnam, (esp. Hanoi) menthol Kent cigarettes have become a beloved accessory. A large part of this community consists of non-smokers who buy and smoke menthol Kents whilst drinking at the weekend. Kent \\"boom\\" (meaning push in Vietnamese and referring to the menthol bubble that the smoker presses and pops to change the flavour to menthol) are enjoyed by some who don't even press the button, others who press immediately and a whole host of subcultural groups that press halfway, after one draw, before the last draw, or before offering to a friend, and so on.

The roots of their partnership lay in the formation of the Solesides collective at the University of California, Davis. History The crew's charter members--which also included DJ Shadow and the future Blackalicious team--were all involved in student radio and shared a progressive-minded approach to hip hop. Lateef and Lyrics Born initially recorded as solo artists; under the name Asia Born, the latter released the first single on the Solesides label, \\"Send Them,\\" in early 1993. The first proper Latyrx release came in 1996, and was actually the B-side of Lateef's solo single \\"The Wreckoning.\\" For the track in question, also called \\"Latyrx,\\" both MCs recorded completely different raps that were played back simultaneously. Coupled with DJ Shadow's production and its unique effect, it started to build an underground buzz for the duo. More solo sides followed that year--Lateef cut \\"The Quickening (The Wreckoning, Pt. II)\\" with DJ Shadow on the boards, and Lyrics Born produced his own 12\\" release, \\"Balcony Beach\\" b/w \\"Burnt Pride.\\" Most of these solo sides, along with a raft of new material, appeared on the duo's debut LP, The Album, which was released in 1997. DJ Shadow produced a total of four tracks, and Chief Xcel (later of Blackalicious) helmed two, while Lyrics Born handled the rest himself. The Album earned rave reviews for its adventurous, electronic-flavored production and the distinctive flows of both rappers. It was followed closely by the Muzapper's Mixes EP, which contained the boundary-pushing single \\"Lady Don't Tek No.\\" Muzapper's Remixes appeared in 1998, but unfortunately, The Album didn't stay in print much longer; it was reissued briefly in 1999 before disappearing again. Meanwhile, Solesides was reconfigured into a new label, Quannum Projects, and the collective officially changed its name to Quannum as well. Latyrx did not record much following their brief reign as an underground sensation. They guested on \\"8 Point Agenda,\\" a 1999 single by The Herbaliser, and also contributed new material to the Quannum Spectrum compilation that year. Quannum Projects finally reissued The Album in 2002, allowing it to take its place alongside the new crop of independent hip hop that included El-P's Def Jux crew, Anti-Pop Consortium, and Anticon. Both Lateef and Lyrics Born went on to successful solo projects, the former with Blackalicious' Chief Xcel and Fatboy Slim. Lyrics Born released two successful solo albums on Quannum Projects, before signing in 2006 to Epitaph Records. Second album Lyrics Born announced on his website in February‚ÄìMarch 2007 through a podcast that a new Latyrx album would see light after his next solo project. The album was finally released in 2013 and was entitled The Second Album. It was released on Latyramid Records to mixed reviews.

Located in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis, it is the adult teaching hospital for the Washington University School of Medicine and a major component of the Washington University Medical Center. In 2018, Barnes-Jewish was named one of the top twenty hospitals in the United States by U.S. News & World Report in its annual ranking. Capacity Barnes-Jewish Hospital is a member of BJC HealthCare and is located on the campus of the Washington University Medical Center. Barnes-Jewish is the largest private employer in Greater St. Louis, employing 10,125 people, including 1,723 attending physicians, in 2018. It is responsible for the education of 1,129 interns, residents, and fellows. As of 2018, the hospital had 1,266 beds with a staff of 10,125.  History  Barnes-Jewish was formed by the merger of two hospitals, Barnes Hospital and The Jewish Hospital of St. Louis. Each hospital was built in the early 1900s in proximity to each other on the eastern edge of Forest Park. Although the hospitals were initially linked by an affiliation agreement in 1993, the two were legally merged in 1996. Barnes Hospital was founded at the bequest of wholesale grocer and banker, Robert Barnes, who died in 1892. In coordination between Barnes executors and St. Louis philanthropist Robert Brookings, the hospital was intended as an affiliate for the Washington University School of Medicine. Barnes hospital opened on December 7, 1914 at its current location on Kingshighway Boulevard. The hospital was designed by architect, Theodore Link, and initially had a 373-bed capacity. It was at this time that the St. Louis Children's Hospital, and in 1915 the reorganized school of medicine, were relocated adjacent to Barnes Hospital. Jewish Hospital was founded in 1902 by leaders of the St. Louis Jewish community in order to care for \\"the sick and disabled of, 'any creed or nationality.'\\" The hospital was originally located on 5414 Delmar Boulevard. Due to the increasing number of patients and need for expansion, the hospital was relocated two blocks north of the Barnes hospital/Washington University Medical School complex in 1926.

He succeeded to the title Earl of Morton in 1774 aged only thirteen, following the death of his father. He was sent to Eton College to be educated. Following his education he conducted a Grand Tour of Europe, as was the fashion of the day, and visited most of the European Courts. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1785. His proposers were Daniel Rutherford, John Robison, and Alexander Keith. He served as vice-president of the Royal Society of London occasionally from 1795‚Äì1819, if Joseph Banks was unavailable. The Earl was a frequent member of the Royal Company of Archers. Also, he had an interest in horse breeding and was noted for his attempts to breed a quagga. He served as a representative peer from 1784 to 1790 and as Queen's Chamberlain 1792 to 1818. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Fife from 1808 to 1824. He was also High Commissioner to the Church of Scotland. On 11 August 1791 he was created Baron Douglas of Loch Leven, in the County of Kinross. Thereafter he took a seat in the House of Lords between Lord Howard de Walden and Lord Walsingham. He was knighted at St. James's Palace in 1797. He died at the family estate of Dalmahoy House on 17 July 1827.The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, (periodical) July to December 1827 Family On 13 August 1814, he married Susan Elizabeth Buller (daughter of Sir Francis Buller).

More specifically, MaxEnt applies inference techniques rooted in Shannon information theory, Bayesian probability, and the principle of maximum entropy. These techniques are relevant to any situation requiring prediction from incomplete or insufficient data (e.g., image reconstruction, signal processing, spectral analysis, and inverse problems). MaxEnt thermodynamics began with two papers by Edwin T. Jaynes published in the 1957 Physical Review.  Maximum Shannon entropy  Central to the MaxEnt thesis is the principle of maximum entropy. It demands as given some partly specified model and some specified data related to the model. It selects a preferred probability distribution to represent the model. The given data state \\"testable information\\"Jaynes, E.T. (1968), p. 229.Jaynes, E.T. (1979), pp. 30, 31, 40. about the probability distribution, for example particular expectation values, but are not in themselves sufficient to uniquely determine it. The principle states that one should prefer the distribution which maximizes the Shannon information entropy, :S_I = - \\\\sum_i p_i \\\\ln p_i. This is known as the Gibbs algorithm, having been introduced by J. Willard Gibbs in 1878, to set up statistical ensembles to predict the properties of thermodynamic systems at equilibrium. It is the cornerstone of the statistical mechanical analysis of the thermodynamic properties of equilibrium systems (see partition function). A direct connection is thus made between the equilibrium thermodynamic entropy STh, a state function of pressure, volume, temperature, etc., and the information entropy for the predicted distribution with maximum uncertainty conditioned only on the expectation values of those variables: :S_{Th}(P,V,T,...)_{(eqm)} = k_B \\\\, S_I(P,V,T,...) kB, Boltzmann's constant, has no fundamental physical significance here, but is necessary to retain consistency with the previous historical definition of entropy by Clausius (1865) (see Boltzmann's constant). However, the MaxEnt school argue that the MaxEnt approach is a general technique of statistical inference, with applications far beyond this. It can therefore also be used to predict a distribution for \\"trajectories\\" Œì \\"over a period of time\\" by maximising: :S_I = - \\\\sum p_{\\\\Gamma} \\\\ln p_{\\\\Gamma} This \\"information entropy\\" does not necessarily have a simple correspondence with thermodynamic entropy. But it can be used to predict features of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems as they evolve over time. For non-equilibrium scenarios, in an approximation that assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium, with the maximum entropy approach, the Onsager reciprocal relations and the Green-Kubo relations fall out directly. The approach also creates a theoretical framework for the study of some very special cases of far-from-equilibrium scenarios, making the derivation of the entropy production fluctuation theorem straightforward. For non-equilibrium processes, as is so for macroscopic descriptions, a general definition of entropy for microscopic statistical mechanical accounts is also lacking. Technical note: For the reasons discussed in the article differential entropy, the simple definition of Shannon entropy ceases to be directly applicable for random variables with continuous probability distribution functions. Instead the appropriate quantity to maximise is the \\"relative information entropy,\\" :H_c=-\\\\int p(x)\\\\log\\\\frac{p(x)}{m(x)}\\\\,dx. Hc is the negative of the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence, or discrimination information, of m(x) from p(x), where m(x) is a prior invariant measure for the variable(s). The relative entropy Hc is always less than zero, and can be thought of as (the negative of) the number of bits of uncertainty lost by fixing on p(x) rather than m(x). Unlike the Shannon entropy, the relative entropy Hc has the advantage of remaining finite and well-defined for continuous x, and invariant under 1-to-1 coordinate transformations. The two expressions coincide for discrete probability distributions, if one can make the assumption that m(xi) is uniform - i.e. the principle of equal a-priori probability, which underlies statistical thermodynamics.  Philosophical Implications  Adherents to the MaxEnt viewpoint take a clear position on some of the conceptual/philosophical questions in thermodynamics. This position is sketched below. = The nature of the probabilities in statistical mechanics = Jaynes (1985,Jaynes, E.T. (1985). 2003,Jaynes, E.T. (2003). et passim) discussed the concept of probability. According to the MaxEnt viewpoint, the probabilities in statistical mechanics are determined jointly by two factors: by respectively specified particular models for the underlying state space (e.g. Liouvillian phase space); and by respectively specified particular partial descriptions of the system (the macroscopic description of the system used to constrain the MaxEnt probability assignment). The probabilities are objective in the sense that, given these inputs, a uniquely defined probability distribution will result, the same for every rational investigator, independent of the subjectivity or arbitrary opinion of particular persons. The probabilities are epistemic in the sense that they are defined in terms of specified data and derived from those data by definite and objective rules of inference, the same for every rational investigator.Jaynes, E.T. (1979), p. 28. Here the word epistemic, which refers to objective and impersonal scientific knowledge, the same for every rational investigator, is used in the sense that contrasts it with opiniative, which refers to the subjective or arbitrary beliefs of particular persons; this contrast was used by Plato and Aristotle, and stands reliable today. Jaynes also used the word 'subjective' in this context because others have used it in this context. He accepted that in a sense, a state of knowledge has a subjective aspect, simply because it refers to thought, which is a mental process. But he emphasized that the principle of maximum entropy refers only to thought which is rational and objective, independent of the personality of the thinker. In general, from a philosophical viewpoint, the words 'subjective' and 'objective' are not contradictory; often an entity has both subjective and objective aspects. Jaynes explicitly rejected the criticism of some writers that, just because one can say that thought has a subjective aspect, thought is automatically non-objective. He explicitly rejected subjectivity as a basis for scientific reasoning, the epistemology of science; he required that scientific reasoning have a fully and strictly objective basis.Jaynes, E.T. (1968), p. 228. Nevertheless, critics continue to attack Jaynes, alleging that his ideas are \\"subjective\\". One writer even goes so far as to label Jaynes' approach as \\"ultrasubjectivist\\",Guttmann, Y.M. (1999), pp. 28, 36, 38, 57, 61. and to mention \\"the panic that the term subjectivism created amongst physicists\\".Guttmann, Y.M. (1999), p. 29. The probabilities represent both the degree of knowledge and lack of information in the data and the model used in the analyst's macroscopic description of the system, and also what those data say about the nature of the underlying reality. The fitness of the probabilities depends on whether the constraints of the specified macroscopic model are a sufficiently accurate and/or complete description of the system to capture all of the experimentally reproducible behaviour. This cannot be guaranteed, a priori. For this reason MaxEnt proponents also call the method predictive statistical mechanics. The predictions can fail. But if they do, this is informative, because it signals the presence of new constraints needed to capture reproducible behaviour in the system, which had not been taken into account. = Is entropy \\"real\\"? = The thermodynamic entropy (at equilibrium) is a function of the state variables of the model description. It is therefore as \\"real\\" as the other variables in the model description. If the model constraints in the probability assignment are a \\"good\\" description, containing all the information needed to predict reproducible experimental results, then that includes all of the results one could predict using the formulae involving entropy from classical thermodynamics. To that extent, the MaxEnt STh is as \\"real\\" as the entropy in classical thermodynamics. Of course, in reality there is only one real state of the system. The entropy is not a direct function of that state. It is a function of the real state only through the (subjectively chosen) macroscopic model description. = Is ergodic theory relevant? = The Gibbsian ensemble idealises the notion of repeating an experiment again and again on different systems, not again and again on the same system. So long- term time averages and the ergodic hypothesis, despite the intense interest in them in the first part of the twentieth century, strictly speaking are not relevant to the probability assignment for the state one might find the system in. However, this changes if there is additional knowledge that the system is being prepared in a particular way some time before the measurement. One must then consider whether this gives further information which is still relevant at the time of measurement. The question of how 'rapidly mixing' different properties of the system are then becomes very much of interest. Information about some degrees of freedom of the combined system may become unusable very quickly; information about other properties of the system may go on being relevant for a considerable time. If nothing else, the medium and long-run time correlation properties of the system are interesting subjects for experimentation in themselves. Failure to accurately predict them is a good indicator that relevant macroscopically determinable physics may be missing from the model. = The Second Law = According to Liouville's theorem for Hamiltonian dynamics, the hyper-volume of a cloud of points in phase space remains constant as the system evolves. Therefore, the information entropy must also remain constant, if we condition on the original information, and then follow each of those microstates forward in time: :\\\\Delta S_I = 0 \\\\, However, as time evolves, that initial information we had becomes less directly accessible. Instead of being easily summarisable in the macroscopic description of the system, it increasingly relates to very subtle correlations between the positions and momenta of individual molecules. (Compare to Boltzmann's H-theorem.) Equivalently, it means that the probability distribution for the whole system, in 6N-dimensional phase space, becomes increasingly irregular, spreading out into long thin fingers rather than the initial tightly defined volume of possibilities. Classical thermodynamics is built on the assumption that entropy is a state function of the macroscopic variables‚Äîi.e., that none of the history of the system matters, so that it can all be ignored. The extended, wispy, evolved probability distribution, which still has the initial Shannon entropy STh(1), should reproduce the expectation values of the observed macroscopic variables at time t2. However it will no longer necessarily be a maximum entropy distribution for that new macroscopic description. On the other hand, the new thermodynamic entropy STh(2) assuredly will measure the maximum entropy distribution, by construction. Therefore, we expect: :{S_{Th}}^{(2)} \\\\geq {S_{Th}}^{(1)} At an abstract level, this result implies that some of the information we originally had about the system has become \\"no longer useful\\" at a macroscopic level. At the level of the 6N-dimensional probability distribution, this result represents coarse graining‚Äîi.e., information loss by smoothing out very fine-scale detail. = Caveats with the argument = Some caveats should be considered with the above. 1\\\\. Like all statistical mechanical results according to the MaxEnt school, this increase in thermodynamic entropy is only a prediction. It assumes in particular that the initial macroscopic description contains all of the information relevant to predicting the later macroscopic state. This may not be the case, for example if the initial description fails to reflect some aspect of the preparation of the system which later becomes relevant. In that case the \\"failure\\" of a MaxEnt prediction tells us that there is something more which is relevant that we may have overlooked in the physics of the system. It is also sometimes suggested that quantum measurement, especially in the decoherence interpretation, may give an apparently unexpected reduction in entropy per this argument, as it appears to involve macroscopic information becoming available which was previously inaccessible. (However, the entropy accounting of quantum measurement is tricky, because to get full decoherence one may be assuming an infinite environment, with an infinite entropy). 2\\\\. The argument so far has glossed over the question of fluctuations. It has also implicitly assumed that the uncertainty predicted at time t1 for the variables at time t2 will be much smaller than the measurement error. But if the measurements do meaningfully update our knowledge of the system, our uncertainty as to its state is reduced, giving a new SI(2) which is less than SI(1). (Note that if we allow ourselves the abilities of Laplace's demon, the consequences of this new information can also be mapped backwards, so our uncertainty about the dynamical state at time t1 is now also reduced from SI(1) to SI(2) ). We know that STh(2) > SI(2); but we can now no longer be certain that it is greater than STh(1) = SI(1). This then leaves open the possibility for fluctuations in STh. The thermodynamic entropy may go \\"down\\" as well as up. A more sophisticated analysis is given by the entropy Fluctuation Theorem, which can be established as a consequence of the time- dependent MaxEnt picture. 3\\\\. As just indicated, the MaxEnt inference runs equally well in reverse. So given a particular final state, we can ask, what can we \\"retrodict\\" to improve our knowledge about earlier states? However the Second Law argument above also runs in reverse: given macroscopic information at time t2, we should expect it too to become less useful. The two procedures are time-symmetric. But now the information will become less and less useful at earlier and earlier times. (Compare with Loschmidt's paradox.) The MaxEnt inference would predict that the most probable origin of a currently low- entropy state would be as a spontaneous fluctuation from an earlier high entropy state. But this conflicts with what we know to have happened, namely that entropy has been increasing steadily, even back in the past. The MaxEnt proponents' response to this would be that such a systematic failing in the prediction of a MaxEnt inference is a \\"good\\" thing.Jaynes, E.T. (1979). It means that there is thus clear evidence that some important physical information has been missed in the specification the problem. If it is correct that the dynamics \\"are\\" time-symmetric, it appears that we need to put in by hand a prior probability that initial configurations with a low thermodynamic entropy are more likely than initial configurations with a high thermodynamic entropy. This cannot be explained by the immediate dynamics. Quite possibly, it arises as a reflection of the evident time-asymmetric evolution of the universe on a cosmological scale (see arrow of time).  Criticisms  The Maximum Entropy thermodynamics has some important opposition, in part because of the relative paucity of published results from the MaxEnt school, especially with regard to new testable predictions far-from- equilibrium.Kleidon, A., Lorenz, R.D. (2005). The theory has also been criticized in the grounds of internal consistency. For instance, Radu Balescu provides a strong criticism of the MaxEnt School and of Jaynes' work. Balescu states that Jaynes' and coworkers theory is based on a non-transitive evolution law that produces ambiguous results. Although some difficulties of the theory can be cured, the theory \\"lacks a solid foundation\\" and \\"has not led to any new concrete result\\".Balescu, R. (1997). Though the maximum entropy approach is based directly on informational entropy, it is applicable to physics only when there is a clear physical definition of entropy. There is no clear unique general physical definition of entropy for non-equilibrium systems, which are general physical systems considered during a process rather than thermodynamic systems in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (2003). The entropy of classical thermodynamics, Chapter 8 of Greven, A., Keller, G., Warnecke (editors) (2003). Entropy, Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, , page 190. It follows that the maximum entropy approach will not be applicable to non- equilibrium systems until there is found a clear physical definition of entropy. This problem is related to the fact that heat may be transferred from a hotter to a colder physical system even when local thermodynamic equilibrium does not hold so that neither system has a well defined temperature. Classical entropy is defined for a system in its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium, which is defined by state variables, with no non-zero fluxes, so that flux variables do not appear as state variables. But for a strongly non- equilibrium system, during a process, the state variables must include non- zero flux variables. Classical physical definitions of entropy do not cover this case, especially when the fluxes are large enough to destroy local thermodynamic equilibrium. In other words, for entropy for non-equilibrium systems in general, the definition will need at least to involve specification of the process including non-zero fluxes, beyond the classical static thermodynamic state variables. The 'entropy' that is maximized needs to be defined suitably for the problem at hand. If an inappropriate 'entropy' is maximized, a wrong result is likely. In principle, maximum entropy thermodynamics does not refer narrowly and only to classical thermodynamic entropy. It is about informational entropy applied to physics, explicitly depending on the data used to formulate the problem at hand. According to Attard, for physical problems analyzed by strongly non-equilibrium thermodynamics, several physically distinct kinds of entropy need to be considered, including what he calls second entropy. Attard writes: \\"Maximizing the second entropy over the microstates in the given initial macrostate gives the most likely target macrostate.\\".Attard, P. (2012). Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics: Foundations and Applications, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, , p. 161. The physically defined second entropy can also be considered from an informational viewpoint.

Vigdal. The Windows version runs well on Linux under Wine. It is also available for retail in the App Store for iOS devices (in iPhone/iPod Touch and iPad versions). The game is a 2D space shooter in the vein of the perennial classic Galaga. It is a rewrite and modernization of a popular Amiga shareware game, Deluxe Galaga, which was written by the same author back in the mid-1990s. Where technically possible, the graphics and sounds are respectful to their Amiga origins.  Gameplay  The player controls a small ship, which moves along the bottom of the screen. An assembly of bug-like alien creatures fly onto the screen and shoot at the player's ship. The player must defeat all the aliens on the screen by shooting at them from the ship to advance to the next level. On defeating some aliens, random bonuses will be dropped for the player to collect, such as money, improved weaponry, or mini games. = Levels = Levels are made in packs of four, with each pack introducing a new alien design. The first two levels of a pack are levels containing only small aliens. The third level introduces larger versions of the aliens. When defeating a larger alien, there is the opportunity to collect a rank marker. When six different rank markers have been collected, the player advances a rank. The fourth and final level of the pack, alternates between a kamikaze level, in which aliens dive from above the screen, and a bonus level, in which the player earns a bonus if all aliens are defeated before they leave the screen area. Every 25 levels there is a boss level. = Shop = At the end of each pack, the player is taken to the shop where there is the option to purchase upgrades, such as extra lives and improved weapons. = Memorystation = A memorystation is one of two mini games that can be entered by collecting a falling bonus from an alien. The object of memorystation is to find pairs by turning over grid-like squares. If all pairs in a memorystation are found, the player receives bonus points and the next time a memorystation is entered there are more squares. = Meteor Storm = A meteor storm is the second mini game that can be entered by collecting a falling bonus from an alien. During a meteor storm, the player must navigate through falling rocks. Occasionally, money, points or gems can be collected that are also falling from the top of the screen. If the player reaches the end of the meteor storm, they are rewarded with a large number of points and amount of money. = Gem Drop = A gem drop is a third mini game that cannot be entered by collecting a bonus. The only way to enter a gem drop is to collect 100 gems, through the use of gem bombs, or collecting gems in memorystations and meteor storms. A gem drop is much like a meteor storm, however only gems fall, and they are worth large numbers of points. If the player collects 1000 gems in one game, a super gem drop is entered, where gems are worth 20 times what they are worth in usual gem drops.  Sequel  In May 2007 it was revealed that Vigdal had begun planning a sequel to Warblade, dubbed Warblade II.EMV Software forum On 19 December 2011, Vidgal revealed the new main screen design for the sequel, now titled Warblade MK II.New main screen The new game was to include a level editor, as well as completely redesigned graphics and levels.Deep space It was to be released for Windows, OS X, iOS and Android.

Both are useful for tamper detection, though each has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Data hashing  A typical data hash will process an input file to produce an alphanumeric string unique to the data file. Should the file be modified, such as if one or more bit changes occur within this original file, the same hash process on the modified file will produce a different alphanumeric. Through this method, a trusted source can calculate the hash of an original data file and subscribers can verify the integrity of the data. The subscriber simply compares a hash of the received data file with the known hash from the trusted source. This can lead to two situations: the hash being the same or the hash being different. If the hash results are the same, the systems involved can have an appropriate degree of confidence to the integrity of the received data. On the other hand, if the hash results are different, they can conclude that the received data file has been altered. This process is common in P2P networks, for example the BitTorrent protocol. Once a part of the file is downloaded, the data is then checked against the hash key (known as a hash check). Upon this result, the data is kept or discarded.  Digital watermarking  Digital watermarking is distinctly different from data hashing. It is the process of altering the original data file, allowing for the subsequent recovery of embedded auxiliary data referred to as a watermark. A subscriber, with knowledge of the watermark and how it is recovered, can determine (to a certain extent) whether significant changes have occurred within the data file. Depending on the specific method used, recovery of the embedded auxiliary data can be robust to post-processing (such as lossy compression). If the data file to be retrieved is an image, the provider can embed a watermark for protection purposes. The process allows tolerance to some change, while still maintaining an association with the original image file. Researchers have also developed techniques that embed components of the image within the image. This can help identify portions of the image that may contain unauthorized changes and even help in recovering some of the lost data. A disadvantage of digital watermarking is that a subscriber cannot significantly alter some files without sacrificing the quality or utility of the data. This can be true of various files including image data, audio data, and computer code.

Early history An American pottery hot water bottle Containers for warmth in bed were in use as early as the 16th century. The earliest versions contained hot coals from the dying embers of the fire, and these bed warmers were used to warm the bed before getting into it. Containers using hot water were soon also used, with the advantages that they could remain in the bed with the sleeper and were not so hot as to be a fire risk. Prior to the invention of rubber that could withstand sufficient heat, these early hot-water bottles were made of a variety of materials, such as zinc, copper, brass, glass, earthenware or wood. To prevent burning, the metal hot water flasks were wrapped in a soft cloth bag. Rubber bottles \\"India rubber\\" hot-water bottles were in use in Britain at least by 1875. Modern conventional hot-water bottles were patented in 1903 and are manufactured in natural rubber or PVC, to a design patented by the Croatian inventor Eduard Penkala. They are now commonly covered in fabric, sometimes with a novelty design. Japanese style plastic hot-water bottle, known locally as a yutanpo, with its cloth protective bag on the right. By the late 20th century, the use of hot-water bottles had markedly declined around most of the world. Not only were homes better heated, but newer items such as electric blankets were competing with hot-water bottles as a source of night- time heat. However the hot-water bottle remains a popular alternative in Australia, Ireland, United Kingdom, developing countries and rural areas. For example, it is widely used in Chile, where it is called a \\"guatero\\". There has been a recent surge in popularity in Japan where it is seen as an ecologically friendly and thrifty way to keep warm. Some newer products function like the older bottles, but use a polymer gel or wax in a heating pad. The pads can be heated in a microwave oven, and they are marketed as safer than liquid-filled bottles or electrically-heated devices. Some newer bottles now use a silicone- based material instead of rubber, which resists very hot water better, and does not deteriorate as much as rubber. Although the stopper size in Ireland and the UK has been largely standard for many decades, the newer bottles (notably those from German manufacturer Fashy) use a wider mouth which is easier to fill (and a larger stopper to fit it). More recent innovations of the traditional hot water bottle include long designs of the bottle. For example, the YuYu Bottle was introduced in 2012 as the world‚Äôs first long hot water bottle. Instead of a conventional square shape, the YuYu Bottle is designed long and flexible, and thus wearable hands-free around the body due to its incorporated tightening strap. While generally used for keeping warm, conventional hot-water bottles can be used to some effect for the local application of heat as a medical treatment, for example for pain relief, but newer items such as purpose-designed heating pads are often used now. Regulation Hot-water bottles are meant to contain very hot fluids and also supposed to be in contact with human skin. It is therefore of the utmost importance to ensure, mainly through standards and regulations, that the closing and welding is stable enough to prevent burns, but also to make sure that the bottle‚Äôs chemical components are not dangerous for human health. More generally, it is crucial to certify and assure that hot-water bottles, whether manufactured, sold or imported, are safe. For instance, the United Kingdom defined British Standards for hot-water bottles to regulate their manufacture and sale as well as to ensure their compliance with all safety standards. The British Standards BS 1970 and BS 1970:2012 (updated version) define, for instance, the bottles‚Äô filling characteristics, safety instructions, allowed materials and components as well as testing methods such as tensile tests for PVC bottles. Most regulations applied to a country are generally harmonized in order to be applied and applicable in a larger area, such as a trade zone. Problems There have been problems with premature failure of rubber hot- water bottles due to faulty manufacture. The rubber may fail strength or fitness tests, or become brittle if manufacturing is not controlled closely. Natural rubber filled with calcium carbonate is the most common material used, but is susceptible to oxidation and polymer degradation at the high temperatures used in shaping the product. Even though the brittle cracks may not be visible externally, the bottle can fracture suddenly after filling with hot water, and can scald the user‚Äîsometimes requiring hospitalization for severe burn cases. Boiling water is not recommended for use in hot-water bottles. This is due to risks of the rubber being degraded from high- temperature water, and the risk of injury in case of breakage. In fiction Alfred, the cantankerous hot-water bottle, is a character from Johnson and Friends, a popular Australian children's television series from the 1990s. This character has gained a cult following in recent years, particularly among those who grew up with the series, due to the odd character choice. Another anthropomorphised hot-water bottle was Walter Hottle Bottle in the British children's comic Jack and Jill.

It was co-written by Roddenberry and Samuel A. Peeples, and directed by Clive Donner. It was one of several unsuccessful pilots created by Roddenberry, and one of several pilots in the 1970s in the occult detective subgenre. The pilot follows the adventures of William Sebastian (Robert Culp), a former criminologist and occult expert, and his colleague, Dr. \\"Ham\\" Hamilton (Gig Young), a physician and forensic pathologist, as they visit the United Kingdom to investigate a case involving the aristocratic Cyon family. The cast includes John Hurt, James Villiers, Gordon Jackson, Ann Bell, and Majel Barrett. Plot summary William Sebastian (Robert Culp) is a former criminologist who now studies the occult to explain the problem of human evil. He has been cursed on one of his adventures by the demon Asmodeus, leaving him in constant need of medical attention. He summons an old colleague, Dr. \\"Ham\\" Hamilton (Gig Young) to his home to help him with a case involving the Cyon family. Dr. Hamilton does not believe in the occult and thinks that Sebastian and his housekeeper Lilith (Majel Barrett) are playing tricks on him when he witnesses unusual events. As the pair are getting reacquainted, a woman claiming to be Anitra Cyon (Ann Bell) unexpectedly visits and tells Sebastian that his services are no longer required. Sebastian recognizes that this person is not Anitra Cyon, but rather a succubus sent to stop Sebastian from investigating the family. He defeats her using the Apocryphal Book of Tobit. He and Ham depart to the airport where they are flown by Mitri Cyon (John Hurt) to London. While over the Atlantic the engines of the plane fail, something that Sebastian claims is the result of supernatural intervention. Thanks to Mitri's expertise, they land safely in England. Sebastian asks the Cyon chauffeur to stop off at the home of Dr. Qualus, a long-time associate who has been researching the Cyon family. Qualus' house is on fire. Ham and Sebastian find Qualus' body lying partially inside a pentagram, the body fatally mauled. The police arrive, and Inspector Cabell (an old acquaintance from their criminology days) escorts them to Cyon Manor. When they reach the Manor, they are greeted first by Sir Geoffrey Cyon (James Villiers), Anitra and Mitri's older brother and head of the family. He is aware that Sebastian and Ham are there to investigate him, and he intends to defy their efforts. The real Anitra (also played by Ann Bell) reiterates her reason for consulting Sebastian: due to an unknown influence, Geoffrey's behaviour has changed dramatically and he has turned Cyon Manor into a den of iniquity. Geoffrey dismisses her concerns. The following day Mitri is attacked by dogs, leaving him in critical condition. Sebastian and Ham suspect Geoffrey is behind the attack. That night, the duo investigate the grounds of the Manor and discover ruins which lead to a hidden underground temple devoted to Asmodeus. They suspect that the real Geoffrey is dead and that Asmodeus has assumed his form. The next day the pair prepare to do battle with Asmodeus and his cult. Further investigation of the hidden temple reveals that it is Mitri who is dead and whose form Asmodeus has assumed. Geoffrey is a pawn who was used to increase the cult and who will be forced to sacrifice Anitra to Asmodeus. Sebastian defeats Asmodeus, whose power is destroyed. The Cyons and the cultists are freed, and the curse on Sebastian is removed. In thanks for his help, the Cyon family gives Sebastian a painting which he had admired‚Äîbut in the final moment of the film, Sebastian is stunned to see the symbol of Asmodeus (a stylized letter \\"A\\") suddenly appear in the corner of the artwork. Asmodeus survives, and the conflict is only beginning.  Cast  * Robert Culp as William Sebastian * Gig Young as Dr. Amos \\"Ham\\" Hamilton * John Hurt as Mitri Cyon * James Villiers as Sir Geoffrey Cyon * Gordon Jackson as Inspector Cabell * Ann Bell as Anitra Cyon * Majel Barrett as Lilith * Jenny Runacre as Sydna * Angela Grant as Butler * Penny Irving as First Maid * Vicki Michelle as Second Maid * Lindy Benson as Third Maid * Sally Farmiloe as Fourth Maid * Michael Latimer as Co-pilot  Production  Spectre was intended as the pilot for a television series, but was rejected. The relationship between Sebastian and \\"Ham\\" is deliberately reminiscent of that of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, although there are also some aspects that recall the relationship between Roddenberry's own Spock and Leonard McCoy. Roddenberry previously revisited this relationship in an earlier failed pilot, The Questor Tapes. Spectre was one of a number of unsuccessful television pilots in the 1970s in the occult detective subgenre. After its rejection by American television, an extended version of Spectre was released in the UK as a theatrical film with additional footage that includes nudity.As noted by Joel Eisner in the TV party piece on Roddenberry's 70s attempts to produce new series The version currently in television syndication is a heavily edited version of the UK theatrical release, which retains some of the less explicit nudity in the Black Mass finale.Per Eisner A novelization of Spectre by the author Robert Weverka was published in 1979. John Cameron was selected as the composer for the film's musical score. Characters =William Sebastian= William Sebastian (Robert Culp) is a former criminologist who worked in partnership with Amos \\"Ham\\" Hamilton for eight years. He is a brilliant detective with incredible intuitive skills and a belief that there are things beyond science that are real. He came to believe that some unseen forces were causing a number of significant crimes, particularly after studying Charles Manson, Richard Speck, the Boston Strangler, and the Tokyo Bluebeard. After his split with Ham five years ago he immersed himself in the Occult, and has an extensive collection of occult artifacts. Recently Sebastian undertook an occult experiment which has damaged his heart. =Amos \\"Ham\\" Hamilton= Dr. Amos \\"Ham\\" Hamilton (Gig Young) is a medical doctor who worked as staff physician and forensic pathologist at Fairview General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, but thirteen years ago he started a partnership with William Sebastian as criminal investigators. He was the more down-to-earth member of the partnership and after eight years Ham became tired of working with Sebastian and returned to Fairview. Recently his alcoholism and womanizing has interfered with his work. =Lilith= Lilith (played by Gene Roddenberry's wife Majel Barrett) is Sebastian's housekeeper, a practicing witch who brews a remedy that \\"cures\\" Ham's alcoholism through aversion therapy.  Novelization  A novelization of the movie was written by Robert Weverka, and published by Bantam Books in 1979 () Robert Weverka novelised a number of other television and movie productions including The Waltons, Apple's Way, The Sting, The Magic of Lassie, and Murder by Decree. The Spectre novelisation is 154 pages long and adds significant background information not present in the script.
