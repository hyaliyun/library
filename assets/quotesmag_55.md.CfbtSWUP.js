It was adapted into the 2008 television miniseries of the same name by HBO Films. Since the TV miniseries debuted, an alternative cover has been added to the book showing Paul Giamatti as John Adams. The book is available as both hardcover and paperback.  Production  Although the book was originally intended to be a dual biography of Adams and Jefferson, McCullough was increasingly drawn to Adams and away from Jefferson. The author spent six years studying Adams, reading the same books he had read and visiting the places he had lived. Perhaps the greatest treasure trove was the enormous amount of correspondence between John Adams and his wife, Abigail Adams, a marriage McCullough calls \\"one of the great love stories of American history.\\" Also invaluable was his long correspondence with his successor as President, Thomas Jefferson, which McCullough calls \\"one of the most extraordinary correspondences in the English language.\\"  Praise  *Walter Isaacson for Time \\"America's most beloved biographer, David McCullough, has plucked Adams from the historical haze...and produced another masterwork of storytelling that blends colorful narrative with sweeping insights.\\" *Booklist \\"[A] wonderfully stirring biography; to read it is to feel as if you are witnessing the birth of a country firsthand.\\" *Library Journal \\"This life of Adams is an extraordinary portrait of an extraordinary man....This excellent biography deserves a wide audience.\\" *Kirkus Reviews \\"Despite the whopping length, there's not a wasted word in this superb, swiftly moving narrative, which brings new and overdue honor to a Founding Father.\\" *The New Yorker \\"David McCullough's portrait may not quite give us the battered titan in all his raw, sulfurous asperity, but his vivid storytelling will surely persuade a generation to look again at this obstinate, brave, and most deeply philosophical of American patriarchs.\\" *Publishers Weekly \\"Here a preeminent master of narrative history takes on the most fascinating of our founders to create a benchmark for all Adams biographers.\\" *Book Reporter \\"Lavish and abundant in documentation, readers will be delighted with the fascinating, colorful narrative in John Adams.\\" *The New York Times \\"...a lucid and compelling work.\\" *The New York Review of Books \\"This big but extremely readable book is by far the best biography of Adams ever written.\\"  Criticism  *The New Republic \\"McCullough barely mentions Adams's political writings; and what he has to say about the two major works consists of brief quotations surrounded by utterly conventional plot summary and commentary.\\" *Claremont Institute \\"Oddly, McCullough has almost nothing to say about Adams's political thought.\\"  Awards  * Ambassador Book Award/English- Speaking Union of the US (2002) * American Academy of Diplomacy Award (2001) * American Revolution Round Table Book Award (2001) * Christopher Award * The Colonial Dames of America Award (2002) * Comm. of Mass.

Sudene was created by suggestion of economist Celso Furtado, one of the leading intellectuals of Brazil, who was the agency's first director. Premise Furtado's premise was that the semi-arid climate of the Northeast was an environmental reality against which it would be very unproductive to fight ‚Äì despite governmental action to take water to that region ‚Äì and that state poverty reduction programs should thus aim at using the existing natural advantages of the area ‚Äì namely, its availability of labor ‚Äì and promote industrialization instead of the region's traditional economic focus, which was on agriculture and livestock. Actions The agency's first steps were to speed up the construction of hydroelectric dams in the S√£o Francisco River, followed by governmental incentives for the creation of heavy industry projects, such as the Cama√ßari Petrochemical Complex, in the state of Bahia, and the industrial district of Aratu, in the metropolitan area of Salvador. Sudene is also responsible for the formation of intermediary products industries: fertilizers production in the state of Sergipe and a chemicals complex in Salgema, state of Alagoas. In the state of Pernambuco, investments concentrated on the metropolitan area of the city of Recife, with durable goods industries being created in the cities of Jaboat√£o, Cabo and Paulista. In the state of Cear√°, a new perspective was adopted: Sudene's incentives helped form a textiles industrial area, around the capital of the state, Fortaleza. In 1999, Sudene was involved in corruption scandals which led President Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994-2002) to decree its dissolution. In 2002, however, the agency was recreated with the name of Adene - Agency for the Development of the Northeast.

When the club was reformed in 1892, the club took out on a lease on a site which became known as Easter Road. Hibernian Park was also located in the Easter Road area; in fact, it was closer to Easter Road itself than the present stadium because it was on the site of what is now Bothwell Street. Bothwell Street, Edinburgh., Google Maps. History Hibernian FC (Hibs) had played at a variety of grounds from their formation in 1875 until moving to Hibernian Park. Initially they played on the Meadows, along with all the other nascent Edinburgh clubs. They subsequently moved to grounds in Newington and Powderhall, but neither of these were used for more than a year at a time. Having lost the lease on the Newington ground in 1879, the opportunity to acquire a site off Easter Road was too good to miss because it was equidistant between Hibs' two main sources of supporters - the Little Ireland community of the Cowgate, and the Roman Catholic population of the port of Leith. Hibernian Park was known by the Hibs supporters as The Holy Ground, in reference to the fact that the club was operated by St. Patrick's Church in the Cowgate.Parish Name: Saint Patrick's , Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh. Hibs were essentially a sporting arm of the Catholic Church in Edinburgh from their formation until 1891. Hibs supporters still use this moniker for the present Easter Road stadium.World Cup fever hits Holy Ground, hibs.net, 8 June 2006. Perhaps the most famous game played at Hibernian Park was when Hibs beat The Invincibles of Preston North End 2-1 in a match described as being the Association Football Championship of the World. The ground also hosted one Scotland international, a 5-1 win against Wales in the 1888 British Home Championship, which was the first ever football international played in Edinburgh. Hibs players Willie Groves and James McLaren both played in the match, with Groves scoring Scotland's fourth goal. The ground also hosted the first ever recorded instance of a women's football match, 'Scotland' beating 'England' 3-0 on 7 May 1881; all the players came from the Glasgow club. After the high points of winning the Scottish Cup, beating Preston and hosting an international, however, Hibs were to suffer a dramatic decline and fall. This was largely precipitated by the formation of Celtic, who attracted many of Hibs' star players by offering financial inducements in a time when Scottish football was still amateur. As Hibs were operated on a charitable basis, they were essentially broke despite being one of the most popular clubs in Scotland. At the same time, Hibs were riven by internal politics relating to the Irish Home Rule bills; a former secretary absconded with a significant amount of funds; and the club inexplicably failed to enter the Scottish Football League when it was formed in 1890. The last first team match played at Hibernian Park was a 9-1 defeat against Dumbarton in the Scottish Cup on 27 September 1890. Hibs had failed to secure the ground lease and building work had already started, which restricted the attendance the ground could hold. Later that season, the building work covered the rest of the park. This was during a period of intense construction work in the area. After the club failed to pay their subscriptions to the Scottish Football Association in 1891, Hibs were deleted from the membership rolls. Philip Farmer, an ancestor of current Hibs owner Sir Tom Farmer, played a major role in resurrecting the club and securing the site that is now known as Easter Road.

Settlements in the Americas: Cross-Cultural Perspectives. Newark: University of Delaware Press, 1991. (p. 240) Biography An active privateer in the West Indies as early as 1607, Elfrith commanded the Treasurer (owned by the Earl of Warwick) for several years. In mid-1613, Elfrith arrived in Bermuda with a Spanish caravel full of grain for the starving island colonists. As England and Spain were not at war, this was technically considered an act of piracy although this fact went unnoticed by the colony. However, the ship also contained black rats which escaped from the ship as the grain was being unloaded in a harbor off St. George's. They quickly bred and were soon nesting in palm trees as well as the thatched roofs of cottages, churches and storehouses. The rats dug holes in the soft coral, feeding on corn and wheat in storehouses and eating the crops and other plants grown by the colony. Despite the colonists attempts to exterminate them, which included using traps, hunting dogs and setting cats into the wild, the rats plagued the colony for several years before the problem was finally brought under control.Doherty, Kieran. Sea Venture: Shipwreck, Survival, and the Salvation of the First English Colony in the New World. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2007. (p. 209) In early 1618, Elfrith was hired by Sir Robert Rich, Lord de la Warr and others to captain the Treasurer for a privateering expedition to the West Indies. His employers managed to obtain a privateering commission from Charles Emmanuel I through his ambassador to England, Count Scarnafissi. He left England in late April or early May and arrived at the Colony of Virginia shortly after the Neptune under Captain Henry Spelman. Their arrival was said to have \\"brought a most pestilent disease (called the bloody flux) which infected almost all the whole colony. That disease, notwithstanding all our former afflictions, was never known before amongst us\\". Five years later, a lawsuit was brought before the court of admiralty in which the Earl of Warwick was accused by Edward Brewster and other colonists of outfitting the Neptune and the Treasurer with arms and ammunition instead of the badly needed provisions and supplies, such as fishing tackle, that they were promised.Brown, Alexander. First Republic in America: An Account of the Origin of This Nation, Written from the Records Then (1624) Concealed by the Council, Rather Than from the Histories Then Licensed by the Crown. Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1898. (pp. 267, 284, 286) In mid-July 1619, he and John Jope of the White Lion captured the Portuguese slaver S√£o Jo√£o Bautista carrying around 370 Angolans taken prisoner during Portugal's war in Luanda. The two privateers intercepted the ship as it sailed towards Veracruz and escaped with at least 200 slaves, Elfrith taking the majority of them as his ship was larger while Jope took less than 30 men and women. They both headed towards the Colony of Virginia, a known safe haven for English privateers under Governor Samuel Argall, with Jope reaching the colony four days ahead of Elfrith and successfully selling his cargo of slaves. Elfrith's arrival was far less welcoming, learning that Charles Emmanuel I had made peace with Spain (thus invalidating his privateering commission) and that Governor Argall had been replaced by Edwyn Sandys (a rival of the Earl of Warwick), and left the colony almost as soon as he arrived. He instead returned to Bermuda where the slaves were put to work on the estate of his employer the Earl of Warwick.Jordan, Don and Michael Walsh. White Cargo: The Forgotten History of Britain's White Slaves in America. New York: New York University Press, 2008. (pp. 86-87) However, he did return to Virginia periodically while on privateering voyages against the Spanish during the next year. Acting under orders from Governor Argall, who may have misrepresented the Earl of Warwick to justify his activities, he continued raiding Spanish shipping. Nathaniel Butler, governor of Bermuda and prot√©g√© of the Earl of Warwick, wrote to the Earl reporting that Elfrith's vessel was \\"in an unseaworthy condition and with her a number of negros\\" when he arrived in the island later that year. He further stated that While on a privateering expedition with Captain Sussex Camock of the bark Somer Ilands in 1625, Elfrith and Camock discovered two islands off the coast of Nicaragua, both separated 50 miles apart from each other. Camock stayed with 30 of his men to explore one of the islands, San Andr√©s, while Elfrith took the Warwicke back to Bermuda bringing news of Providence Island. Governor Bell wrote on behalf of Elfrith to Sir Nathaniel Rich, a businessman and cousin of the Earl of Warwick, who presented a proposal for colonizing the island noting its strategic location \\"lying in the heart of the Indies & the mouth of the Spaniards\\". Although this also meant the island would be subject to Spanish attacks, Bell assured Rich that the island would become invincible once fortified and make a highly valued base for privateers. Bell also pointed out that San Andreas, lower and more favorable for farming, could never be made \\"half so strong\\". Elfrith was appointed admiral of the colony's military forces in 1631, and Black Rock Fort the following year, remaining the overall military commander for over seven years. During this time, Elfrith served as a guide to other privateers and sea captains arriving in the Caribbean. As early as 1631, he warned of places where English ships might be attacked by natives or escaped slaves including the areas of Dominica and Trujillo.Chaplin, Joyce E. Subject Matter: Technology, the Body, and Science on the Anglo-American Frontier, 1500-1676\\\\. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2001. (pp. 131-132) That same year, he left on an unauthorized expedition to Central America where he attacked and captured a Spanish frigate in Cape Gracias a Dios although he was forced to leave behind a pinnace before returning to Providence Island. This attack was considered an act of piracy as he did not have a letter of marque from the Providence Island Company. The incident was also condemned by the colonists, concerned that the colony might be seen as a base for privateering, and wrote to friends and family in England believing Elfrith's reckless behavior was endangering the colony. Elfrith's raid not only revealed the colony's presence to the Spaniards but left the colony open to attack before adequate fortifications could be built. It is speculated that Elfrith may have tried to intentionally provoke the Spaniards to attack the colony believing the privateering commissions would be granted in order to retaliate. Later that year, Elfrith entertained the Dutch privateer Diego El Mulato in the colony further angering the residents and the PIC. Although an enemy of the Spanish and a well-known officer under Piet Hein, it was thought dangerous to invite any privateer into the colony to see its defenses. In an effort to make peace with the company, he gave them his Logbook which contained an elaborate manuscript describing the coastlines and the navigation directions of the Caribbean. Considered by modern editors and cartographers as \\"remarkably accurate\\", Elfrith wrote that he had compiled this information during his exploration and privateering voyages for his own use and felt that he should make it available to English captains as many of the other \\"ancient seamen\\" who also knew these charts were now dead and that the \\"drafts and platts made in England were very false\\". Also included were details for the approaches of the Mosquito Coast and the Bay of Trujilo as well as Providence Island itself. In 1632, he and Samuel Axe, the other principal military commander, became involved in an argument resulting in Axe leaving the colony and the PIC. A dispute between the two first arose at the first harvest of the island's first tobacco crop. The PIC had made a vague mention of Elfrith, Axe and Bell receiving a portion for their efforts in establishing the colony with Elfrith and Axe arguing over their shares. The two also disagreed of the strategic value of Warwick Fort. Axe ultimately decided to leave the colony because of this dispute. In 1636, Elfrith resumed privateering upon receiving a letter of marque from the PIC. He was replaced by Governor Robert Hunt in April 1638, however he continued as a privateer until 1641.

He was one of the most violent and bloodthirsty men in the Gulf of Mexico during the early 19th century and raided shipping in the gulf for well over a decade before his death. Gambi was one of several pirates associated with Jean Lafitte and later assisted him during the Battle of New Orleans along with Dominique You, Rene Beluche and another fellow Italian-born pirate Louis \\"Nez Coup√©\\" Chighizola.Candeloro, Dominic and Joseph Maselli. Images of America: Italians in New Orleans. Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2004. (pg. 10) He is briefly mentioned in the 2007 historical novel Strangely Wonderful: Tale of Count Balashazy by Karen Mercury. Biography One of Lafitte's most rebellious and unruly partners, Gambi had a long criminal history that preceded him prior to his arrival in New Orleans during the early 19th century. Within several years, he had become of the major pirates active in the Gulf of Mexico and was claimed to have personally killed dozens of his victims with an axe. He was one of the first men to be approached by Jean Lafitte when he first began to organize the warring factions of the pirates of Grand Terre and the Bay of Barataria. At one of his earliest conferences, Lafitte asked his fellow pirates to sail as privateers with a letter of marque and limit their attacks only to the Spanish. Gambi openly defied him however, refusing to this request outright and left the conference. Soon after, Lafitte received news that Gambi was encouraging his own men to revolt against him. Lafitte was soon confronted by one of Gambi's officers who, challenging him with a pistol, shouted \\"The men of Gambi take orders only from Gambi!\\" Lafitte, in true fashion, drew his own pistol and shot his challenger, killing him. This subsequently ended any talk of rebellion against Lafitte.Asbury, Herbert. The French Quarter: An Informal History of the New Orleans Underworld. New York: Alfred K. Knopf, 1936. (pg. 159, 160, 166-167) Sailing with Lafitte's pirate fleet during the next years, he was later given command of the schooner Petit Milan in May 1813 and captured a Spanish schooner carrying a cargo of dry goods soon after. He took the prize to Cat Island, roughly west of the mouth of Lafourche, with the profits being split between the Lafitte brothers and the rest of the fleet. He and the others were well known in New Orleans and openly sold captured prizes and cargo, often English manufactured goods, to friends and acquaintances in the city. He and the others sided, with Lafitte, against the British, during the War of 1812 and was present with Lafitte, Dominique You, Rene Beluche and Louis \\"Nez Coup√©\\" Chighizola during the Battle of New Orleans. After the war, Gambi was granted American citizenship by President James Madison as were Lafitte and the others who participated in the battle. After Lafitte left Grand Terre for Texas, Gambi settled on Cheniere Caminada, building a large house and raising his family there. The house became a popular hangout for Lafitte, Dominique You, Rene Beluche and others.Field, Martha R. Louisiana Voyages: The Travel Writings of Catharine Cole. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2006. (pg. 20-21, 205) In 1815, Gambi was enlisted by General Jean Robert Marie Humbert and Jos√© √Ålvarez de Toledo y Dubois in their conspiracy to invade Texas. Despite the United States and Spain being at peace, they funded his piracy activities against the Spanish. In May, he captured two Spanish ships off the coast of Tampico and brought them back to Grande Isle on June 1. While both ships were carrying cocoa and dry goods, one ship was found with silver ingots. The crew and passengers of the two ships were held captive in what was described by one of the captives as a \\"most cruel situation\\" for four weeks before Gambi send them back in one of the prizes. Spanish agents in New Orleans eventually become aware of the intentions of Humbert and Toledo however, especially after Humbert publicly stated his grand plans in a newspaper article, and both Toledo and Gambi were arrested by Commodore Daniel Patterson for piracy. Neither of the men were convicted, however.Davis, William C. Lone Star Rising: The Revolutionary Birth of the Texas Republic. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2004. (pg. 34-35) Gambi was one of the hundred or so Baratarians who followed Lafitte after receiving his pardon from President James Madison. He was going to be given command of the Victoria, however he left almost immediately after due to a falling out between him and the Lafittes when Pierre Lafitte sued him in a civil suit over a $250 loan on July 2, 1817. During the next four years, he engaged in outright piracy, continuing to loot and sink a number of ships before he himself was apparently killed by his own men who found him asleep on a pile of gold. Catching up to Gambi once more, his schooner was captured in December 1819 by Daniel Patterson in what is thought to have been the last pirate ship active in the western Gulf of Mexico. Patterson learned from the crew that they had killed Gambi after learning that he had kept several thousand dollars owed to them they had taken from their latest victim. As he slept on deck during the night, his head resting on a spar, one of his men decapitated him using \\"the very bloody ax which he so often used\\", according to news reports published around 1819, including a colorful story by the Opelousas Courier.Davis, William C.

The player is put in charge of an American SSN submarine in the Norwegian Sea Theater with the overall role of a hunter killer performing various missions in the context of the global conflict described in the book representing a campaign. Its original Commodore 64 version was co-designed and co-programmed by the famous game designer Sid Meier. Plot As with in the book, the game concentrates on the Norwegian Sea theater, placing the player as captain of a single United States Navy nuclear-powered submarine tasked to disrupt Soviet forces in the area between the Kola Peninsula and the Greenland-Iceland-UK barrier. Missions may include interdiction of tanker fleets, stopping amphibious landing forces, eliminating Soviet wolf pack submarines and many others. The background story remains true to the book's plot but the final mission is always to prevent the Soviets from launching nuclear missiles by locating and eliminating their ballistic missile submarines. Gameplay The player may choose from four different timelines. Starting in the early 1980s limits the player to Permit, or early -class submarines, but the Soviets have weak sonar, whereas starting in the late 1980s allows the player to use the improved Los Angeles class and even the newer subs. Weapons improve accordingly, with Tomahawk missiles and improved Mark 48 torpedoes included in later timelines but the Soviets begin deploying nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and much better anti-submarine warfare ships. The goal of the game is always consistent: Inflicting as much damage as possible on the Soviets in the Norwegian Sea, thus allowing safe passage to supply convoys coming from America and preventing amphibious forces from conquering Norway and Iceland. In order to make contact with enemy forces, the player must navigate the sub in a map of the North Sea, depending on his sub's sensors as well as allied aircraft, satellites and SOSUS arrays to detect the Soviet forces. Success or failure of the missions impacts the progress of the war depicted by shifts in the front line on a simple map of Europe. If the player fails in a mission then Soviet forces capture more territory, but if he succeeds then NATO is able to resist the Soviet attacks. In the course of the campaign the player can gain rank and possibly earn medals as well. In the end of the war, a final score is calculated and the player is awarded a post-war rank if NATO wins the war; this rank can vary from commander to admiral depending on how successful they have been in their missions. A poor performance in the game, particularly in the final mission, means that the Soviets win the war and the player ends up with the rank of Tovarishch (comrade), becoming a political prisoner in a communist-ruled America. Reception Compute! called Red Storm Rising a \\"must\\" for fans of Tom Clancy or military simulations. Computer Gaming World in 1988 and 1992 gave the game four and a half stars out of five, commending it for balancing realism and gameplay while noting deviations from realism, such as the durability of the player's submarine. The reviewer noted the game is \\"relatively easy to learn and win. This reviewer does not mean that the challenge is absent, but while the challenge is omnipresent, it is surmountable\\". In a 1994 survey of wargames the magazine gave the title three- plus stars out of five, stating that it was \\"one of the best on the market\\". In 1996, the magazine ranked Red Storm Rising as the 39th best PC game of all time, calling it \\"a modern submarine combat game unmatched even by today's offerings, the play balance of scenarios, campaigns and realism was near perfect.\\" Cold Waters, a \\"spiritual successor\\" to Red Storm Rising, was released in 2017.

A Tudor revival building constructed in 1931 by William Sprague to house a service station, restaurant and garage, it is the largest of three remaining two-story fuel station buildings on US 66, originally housing a caf√© and service station on the main floor plus two second-floor apartments for the owner and the station attendant. History As Pine Street (the main U.S. 66 route before construction of the Veterans Parkway as a bypass after 1940) is part of a largely-residential neighbourhood, the station was designed to fit with its surroundings by having the building follows the architectural conventions of a private residence. While additions were made to the station in 1948 and 1967 (one of which sited a second auto service bay as an adjoining garage beside the main building) the original building's design has been left largely intact. Originally a Cities Service vendor, the station has sold various brands of fuel (including Gulf Oil during the 1960s). The last fuel was dispensed in 1971 and the pumps removed by 1979. The building then served as a storefront for various businesses including Joe's Welding and Boiler Company, Corn Belt Manufacturing, Yellow Cab and Avis Rent-a-Car. The last occupants were Hodge's Catering and Bridal World before the building was ultimately left vacant. Restoration effort Illinois State University instructor and Route 66 historical author Terri Ryburn, with her husband William Sanders (August 23, 1933 - January 6, 2011), purchased the station at a cost of $220,000 to begin restoration in October 2006. An architectural study was completed and the roof, electric and plumbing systems, bathrooms, ceilings and heating and air conditioning system replaced as the first steps in an eventual restoration of the property. The owner's stated intention is to reopen the historic building as an information centre, caf√©, diner, soda fountain, bed and breakfast and event space; these plans have been delayed due to an estimated total cost of $1.2 million to fully complete this ambitious project. Sprague's Super Service has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since April 25, 2008, was inducted into the Route 66 Association of Illinois Hall of Fame in 2009 and designated municipally as a local historic landmark on August 15, 2011. In December 2010, an outdoor wayside exhibit was installed to describe the history of the Sprague Service Station in all the various incarnations it has gone through over the years as a service station, a residence and various retail operations. In 2012, a group of Illinois State University interior design students proposed various designs for interior renovations. Various attempts have been made to raise funds to complete the restoration; in addition to about $90,000 from the owner's own pockets, contributions have included a $46,695 grant from the town for a new roof and temporary furnace, a $20,000 matching grant from the National Park Service for a heating and air conditioning system, duct work and ceiling, a $10,000 matching grant from the National Park Service to replace windows in the living quarters above the station, a $10,000 grant from the state for two new bathrooms and a day of volunteer service from the Route 66 Association. An additional $10,000 federal matching grant in 2012 subsidized restoration of historic wood-frame windows and doors. In 2010, proceeds from the sale of a 'Pics on Route 66‚Ä≤ 2011 Calendar by David Schwartz were donated to the restoration effort; local classic country group Wagon Load A Trouble performed for free at the site in 2014. Attempts have also been made to raise funds through private individual donation. Ryburn still plans at some point to include a coffee and ice cream shop, a tea room and theatre space but, as of 2014, says \\"The short-term goal now is to finish the downstairs and rent that out as event space, so I can get some income to finish my plans.

They had notable releases for platforms such as the MSX, LaserActive, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, PlayStation, Dreamcast, Game Gear, and PC-FX. History The company was initially known for the successful J.B. Harold Murder Club series of murder mystery adventure games, developed from 1986 onwards. They were initially released as computer games and later ported to the PC Engine CD console, Nintendo Family Computer, Nintendo DS handheld, and iOS mobile. Riverhillsoft also published Prince of Persia, which initially failed in North America, in Japan. Their ports to the Japanese NEC PC-9801 and PC Engine CD platforms featured improved graphics (introducing the Prince's classic \\"turban and vest\\" appearance) and a new Red Book audio soundtrack. They also ported it to other computers and video game consoles, helping the game become a worldwide success. Riverhillsoft were later known for several early survival horror games. These include the 1994 game Doctor Hauzer and the OverBlood series. Their final release was the strategy video game World Neverland Plus: Orurudo Oukoku Monogatari for the Dreamcast in 1999. Following layoffs in 2000, the company turned its focus on mobile gaming, which proved unsuccessful. In June 2004, it filed for bankruptcy and the majority of its employees left to form a new company, called Althi, Inc., absorbing Riverhillsoft.

Abrams Books) l8r, g8r is the third novel in a young adult series by Lauren Myracle written entirely as instant messages; the first two are ttyl and ttfn. l8r, g8r is a coming of age novel published on March 1, 2007 by Harry N. Abrams. l8r g8r was the No. 1 banned book in 2009 due to the prevalent sexual content, use of profanity and the use of shorthand language. The fact that the book depicts sexual content among adults also contributed to its banning. Despite the notoriety, it is widely popular among children, particularly young women who feel that they can relate to the characters. Plot summary Angela is excited just to be reunited with her friends for their final year of high school. Zoe is ecstatic about seeing her boyfriend Doug after he has traveled the world. Zoe later has an encounter with a girl in her class where she shared an embarrassing secret about Jana, a viciously mean but popular school girl and an enemy of Maddie, Zoe and Angela. She find outs that Jana has a teddy bear named \\"Boo Boo Bear\\" that she is very attached to. Moments later Jana comes and finds out that Zoe knows about Boo Boo bear and becomes furious. Maddie anticipates Jana to retaliate by attacking Zoe in some way. Zoe decides to start taking birth control pills so she can have sex with Doug. Angela gets wary of her friendship with Zoe after a classmate said that Zoe thought she was flirting with Doug. Zoe denies that she made the comment but did ask Angela if she did have feelings for him. Angela indignantly denied it. Consequently, Angela becomes a bit skeptical about her friendship with Zoe and her skepticism lingers throughout the novel. Zoe also notably spends more time with Doug than she does with Maddie and Angela which distances her from them. As Zoe becomes more codependent on Doug, Angela becomes more aware of her lack of attraction to her boyfriend Logan. Angela later admits that she doesn't really like Logan as a boyfriend to Maddie and eventually breaks up with him. Maddie surmises that Jana started the rumors about Angela. Therefore, Maddie decides to embarrass Jana by making an announcement essentially calling her a liar to the whole school. Jana retaliates by putting Maddie's picture of her topless on Craigslist for sexual encounters. Zoe and Angela try to help Maddie and retaliate with legal charges against Jana but Maddie refuses. Regardless of Maddie's request to leave the matter alone, Angela breaks into Jana's house and leaves a note suggesting that Jana's room has been searched. Angela later finds out that Logan was cheating on her with Jana while they were dating. Maddie gets accepted into in Santa Cruz University in California and Zoe gets accepted in Kenyon. Zoe is reproached by Doug for being too \\"codependent\\" and Angela for being passive after not avenging her when \\"Jana placed\\" a dead bird in her jeep. Angela decides to move on from Logan. Zoe decides to stop being passive and kidnap Jana's Boo Boo bear by creating a ploy to get Jana out of her car and steal the bear. Her plan nearly succeeds but she ends up being trapped in the back seat of Jana's car and witnesses Jana yelling at her step-mother who is having an affair with a liquor store clerk. Zoe is discovered by Jana and finds out that Jana didn't actually put the dead bird in Angela's car. The novel ends with the three friends recapitulating their senior year and planning to enjoy their graduation together. Style Each page is framed to look like an IM web page with the cursor on the screen near the \\"send\\" and \\"cancel\\" button on the page. Additionally, Maddie, Zoe and Angela have their own screen name and font. Emoji's are also incorporated in this book. Theme Myracle addresses the theme of friendship in the novel. She presents the necessity to defend yourself and your friends. The novel also extends the theme by suggesting that friendship should be defended wisely. Publication and reception l8r, g8r was first published in 2007 by Abrams publishing company. It has sold over 100,000 copies. One source says she was referred to as \\"Satan\\", a \\"pedophile\\" and \\"corrupter of the youth\\" for the topics that she addresses in her novels Another source refers to the series as \\"sexually explicit and offensive\\". Nevertheless, some kids felt that they can identify with the characters. Young girls have received her books well; one girl said that she felt that she had an older sister through Myracle's books.

It served as the main airport for Oslo from 1927 to 1939, along with Kjeller Airport. The aerodrome consisted of docks, a landing ramp, terminal building and a hangar and used a section of the Oslofjord as its runway. Being located on an island it was necessary to transport passengers by boat to the island. The airport only operated during the summer, typically from May through September. Oslo's first airport was located on the neighboring island of Lind√∏ya, but the authorities preferred Gressholmen as a location. Although plans surfaced in 1919, funding was not ensured until 1926. Norsk Luftruter received a concession to operate the airport, ground handling and the ferry service. Deutsche Luft Hansa commenced the first service on 18 July 1927, flying from Oslo via Gothenburg and Copenhagen to Szczecin. The following year the terminus was moved to Travem√ºnde outside L√ºbeck. The airport was also used by Halle & Peterson's Norway Post flights during the early 1930s and by Wider√∏e in 1934. Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) started domestic flights and an international service to Amsterdam in 1935. Deutsche Luft Hansa moved its flights to Kjeller from 1938 and from 1 July the following year all civilian traffic was transferred to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Gressholmen saw a limited amount of use by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service, the Luftwaffe and the Royal Norwegian Air Force until it was closed in 1946. Most of the facilities, including the hangar, remain today and are used for a marina. History =Establishment= Aerial view of the airport in 1937 Plans for an airport serving Oslo were first presented by Det Norske Luftfartrederi in 1919. The airline proposed that Lind√∏ya, an island located immediately north of Gressholmen, would be a suitable site. The issue was debated in Parliament, as the airline proposed leasing of the island from the state for 99 years. Oslo Port Authority opposed, stating that the use of Lind√∏ya would interfere with the ship traffic in the port. Instead, they proposed that Gressholmen would be a more suitable location.Wisting: 15 A committee was appointed by the Ministry of Defense‚Äîwhich was at the time responsible for aviation policy‚Äîto look into the construction of airport. It concluded that airports should be state- owned,Wisting: 16 and that the state should grant sufficient funding to establish an airport in Oslo. This would allow for the establishment of a service to Copenhagen, and possibly at a later date domestic flights to Trondheim, Bod√∏ and Harstad. The issue was dismissed by Parliament.Wisting: 18 The issue was considered by Parliament again in 1923. By then Oslo Municipality had issued a grant of 130,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) under the explicit condition that the state finance the rest of the airport. The total cost of construction was estimated at NOK 275,000. Parliament debated issuing NOK 50,000, but the proposal failed to gather a majority. An air route had by then been established from Hamburg via Malm√∂ to Gothenburg and the airline offered to extend it to Oslo if a suitable airport was built.Wisting: 19 The issue resurfaced in Parliament in both 1926 and 1927. The main argument from those opposing the airport was that they did not believe that commercial aviation had any potential. NOK 10,000 was granted in 1926, but further funding was not made available.Wisting: 20 Norwegian Air Lines' Junkers Ju 52 landing at the airport Construction commenced in 1926 and was completed the following year. This included the construction of a hangar and a slip.Waage: 24 Wilhelm Meisterlin established the company Norske Luftruter. It did not have its own aircraft, but instead cooperated with Deutsche Luft Hansa.Lorentzen: 74 Norske Luftruter bought a boat, MB √òrn I, and was responsible for ground handling for Deutsche Luft Hansa, ground transport and the operation of the airport. Within a month Norwegian Air Lines was established and it also applied to operate the airport and affiliated service, but this was rejected by the state. Instead, DNL was granted a concession to operate a ferry service from Oslo East Station to Gressholmen.Nerdrum: 40 =Operation= Deutsche Luft Hansa originally used Dornier Do J Wal aircraft. German mechanical crew arrived on 11 July and the first landing took place on 16 July, surrounded by festivities. The first revenue landing took place at 18:30 on 18 July. The route flown was from Szczecin via Copenhagen and Gothenburg to Oslo. In addition to passengers, the service had carried post.Storberget: 24 Flights lasted until 30 September when the season ended. Deutsche Luft Hansa had then flown 636 passengers and of post. Deutsche Luft Hansa Junkers Ju 52 The 1928 season commenced on 21 May, seeing the route reduced to three weekly services and the southern terminus of the route moved to Travem√ºnde outside L√ºbeck. This allowed for the introduction of the larger ten-passenger Rohrbach Ro V Rocco aircraft. It made only seven flights, the last on 16 June, before it was taken out of service as the airline deemed it unsuitable. From 20 June the service was flown using a Dornier Do R Superwal, the first service used by the new class of aircraft. The 1939 season lasted from 21 May to 31 August, and was served using Dornier Wals and Superwals. From 1930 a daily service was again introduced. The number of connections from L√ºbeck increased, featuring Berlin, Prague, Vienna and Paris. By then the annual ridership had increased to 935. Patronage fell in 1931 to 774 and to 582 the following year. Deutsche Luft Hansa widened its season in 1933 to encompass services from 1 May to 30 September, allowing ridership to increase to 1,230. From 1934 the airline introduced Junkers Ju 52 aircraft and recorded 2,387 passengers. Norwegian Air Lines' Junkers Ju 52 docked at Gressholmen Norsk Luftruter bought a LFG V 13 in 1928, which they converted to floats and based at Gressholmen. The following June a second similar aircraft was delivered and the company started flying a service from Gressholmen via Lillehammer to Bygdin. Otherwise they were used for various charter and joy rides. The airline sold both aircraft in 1932. The Lind√∏ya-based Holm & B√∏e started ferry services to Gressholmen in the early 1930s on contract with the airlines.Lorentzen: 77 From the early 1930s Norway Post started leasing designated postal night flights, which were flown by Halle & Peterson.Storberget: 24 However, by were stopped in 1932 due to lack of funding.Storberget: 25 From its establishment in 1934, Wider√∏e conducted their flights out of Oslo to towns along the coast. However, they soon moved their Oslo operations to Ingierstand on the mainland. A 1930 government-appointed civil aviation commission concluded in 1932 that a single, large national airline be established.Nerdrum: 42 To fill this role, the Fred. Olsen & Co.-backed Norwegian Air Lines was established.Nedrum: 43 Norsk Luftruter ceased operations in 1934. Fred. Olsen subsequently took over the ferry service, operation of the airport and ground handling. Norwegian Air Lines' Sikorsky S-43 LN-DAG at Gressholmen DNL was granted a ten-year monopoly on all domestic flights on 5 April 1935. This initially consisted of a sea plane route from Oslo along the coast to Troms√∏ and an international route from Oslo via Kristiansand to Amsterdam.Nedrum: 72 DNL received NOK 200,000 in state grants, plus NOK 100,000 from Norway Post, for the first year of operation.Nedrum: 73 Services commenced on 7 June with a wet leased Ju 52 from Luft Hansa on the international route. The domestic routes were flown using Junkers W 34.Nedrum: 75 It bought a new ferry, MB Teist. DNL's travel time from Oslo to Bergen was four and a half hours, with intermediate stops in Moss, Arendal, Kristiansand, Stavanger and Haugesund.Nedrum: 77 DNL struck a deal with Pan American World Airways in 1936 to start transatlantic flights and bought a Sikorsky S-43. The deal with Pan Am fell through, by Valkyrien became a regular aircraft at Gressholmen.Nedrum: 85 The same year DNL subcontracted the operations of the ferries to Holm & B√∏e, when they took delivery of their new ferry, MS Oslo IX. It served until the closing of the aerodrome. Deutsche Luft Hansa ceased operations at Gressholmen after the 1937 season. It introduced wheeled Ju 52s and moved its flights to Kjeller Airport.Guhnfeld: 19 Passenger boarding a Norwegian Air Lines Junkers Ju 52 =Closing= Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, Oslo had a split airport model. Land planes operated out of Kjeller, while seaplanes operated out of Gressholmen. This was by many regarded as a suboptimal solution, largely because both airports had poor ground transport. The Norwegian Aero Club proposed several new locations in 1930, including Ulven and Ekeberg. Also the 1932 committee appointed by the Ministry of Defense was critical to Gressholmen, in part because the ferrying of passengers would become impractical with increased traffic, and in part because it interfered with the ship traffic in the port. It estimated that land planes would be dominant in the future, and looked into eight possible locations. It concluded that Fornebu, located in the neighbouring municipality of B√¶rum was the most suitable. It also felt that Ulven and Ekeberg could be suitable sites.Wisting: 22 The government appointed several airport committees through the 1930s, and they all concluded with Fornebu as the most suitable location. The proposal was approved by the government in 1934. Oslo Municipality bought the land in September and construction started within days.Wisting: 26 Fornebu opened on 1 June 1939,Wisting: 36 causing the closure of Gressholmen as a civilian airport. However, the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service took it into use.Guhnfeldt: 200 At the break-out of Operation Weser√ºbung‚Äîthe start of the German occupation of Norway on 9 April 1940‚Äîthe Luftwaffe bombed Gressholmen at 08:30. At the time there were two Junkers Ju 52s at the airport, one was for the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service and the other was intended for civilian use.Guhnfeldt: 201 Throughout the Second World War there was some German activity at the airport. After the end of the war Gressholmen was taken over by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. However, they only remained at the aerodrome until 1946. They retained ownership of the facility until 1953 when it was sold to ferry operator B√•tservice, who refurbished the hangar and docks and used it for winter storage of their ferries. Facilities The airport was located on Gressholmen, an island situated in the Oslofjord, close to downtown Oslo, only accessible by boat. It consisted of a hangar, a terminal building, a loading ramp and docks. The hangar and terminal buildings remain in use today for storage of pleasure boats and the docks are used as a marina.

It was created by damming the Centennial Branch of the Little Patuxent River. The lake and the park feature a dam, a wildlife area, a walking trail, boating, fishing, and other recreational activities. The park is owned by the Howard County Department of Recreation and Parks. The lake is used by the county and state for the conservation of various types of fish, such as trout and bass, with fishing restrictions implemented, though an overabundance has resulted in restrictions being lifted at times. Currently, normal non-tidal Maryland Department of Natural Resources fishing regulations apply. History In 1969, the County attempted to purchase by condemnation, 64 acres of the land occupying Centennial Park from a company run by the land speculator Joel Kline for $3,180 an acre. The property contained an early 1800s farmhouse that had been destroyed by fire during Kline's ownership. Kline was later indicted for real estate fraud that was linked to local politicians up to Spiro Agnew who was forced to resign. The County eventually bought the Centennial lake parkland from Kline's creditors in 1975 at nearly twice the cost. In 1969, Spiro Agnew proclaimed the arrival of the first Columbia based scientific firm, Hittman Associates that relocated for favorable lease rates from Howard Research and Development. Hittman in turn was contracted by the EPA using Wilde Lake as an example to recommend reuse of storm water runoff from Columbia's reservoir systems for residential drinking water to save on development costs. On 1 December 2013, the lake was temporarily closed following the drowning of a man. In late Fall 2015, the lake was lowered nearly 10 feet to accommodate repairs to the dam riser gates. It was restored to normal levels in January 2016.

The Colliers of the Atlanta Area, Pierces and the Virginia Harrisons The Colliers are one of the founding families of Atlanta, Georgia and heavily influenced politics in that area in the 19th century. The family shares striking resemblances to the highly romanticized and fictional O'Hara family in \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" (Irish Catholic otherness, Mims family Peach Tree near Buckhead, sawmill owned by Andrew Jackson Collier, Butler family, appearance by actress Lillian Kemble-Cooper, relation to the family, in film adaptation). The Wilkes family, Scarlett's unattainable love interest, may be cousins to the Mitchells since her family line hails from Wilkes County, and they were an actual, prominent secessionist family. The author, Margaret Mitchell, is a relation to the Collier family and to the author of this article. I don't have a source, but I believe a Harris relative made a trip from Atlanta after it was burned in a wagon, as Scarlett does. The book is controversial in its treatment of race. Mitchell was herself a philanthropist in the African-American community and a member of a racially progressive family that would have personally faced significant ethnic discrimination and even violence from the second reincarnation of the Ku Klux Klan based out of her hometown of Atlanta at the time of her book's publication, making most modern interpretations, at best, muddled. The Colliers were a specific target of General Sherman in the politically decisive Atlanta Campaign and the March to the Sea since they owned much of downtown Atlanta, including the railroads and military industrial facilities supplying the Confederate Army. Sherman destroyed most of Atlanta after a nearly year-long campaign, securing Lincoln's re-election (instead of signing a peace treaty with the Confederacy). The city was defended by cousin, General William J. Hardee, and a Collier fought in the famous Atlanta Sharp Shooters. Sherman spared some of Atlanta, especially those churches and properties belonging to Irish Catholics, since many of his own troops were Irish Catholic themselves. The Colliers heavily intermarried with prominent Irish Catholic families before and after the war, including the Carroll family of Maryland, mentioned in the film. Although this would become a political liability along with likely their ownership of railroads (See: scalawag) following the rise of several powerful Conservative, Protestant Scots-Irish and populist political movements in the Deep South, the family has remained economically and socially powerful. Scalawag politicians who used the political vacuum of Reconstruction for personal graft and political expediency were a true problem. The railroads of Atlanta were rebuilt before the Georgia Constitutional Convention and before the implementation of martial law under Radial Reconstruction in 1867 from the Colliers' extended family finances, although it did not prevent political attacks. Today the family runs Collier International, a successful real estate brokerage. The Colliers are partly descended from the Pierce (Peirce) and Harrison families with whom the family has intermarried dozens of times, as well as other very important political families. See also, note to African- American ancestry researchers at the bottom. Thomas Pierce (1584‚Äì1666) Mass Bay Colony. Constable. Fence Viewer.

The Bushes are second cousins through former first lady Barbara Pierce Bush. * President George Bush * President George Walker Bush Lewis P. Peirce (1755‚Äì1833) moved to Oglethorpe County, Georgia with his wife Ann Wooten in the 1790s. He served in the Revolutionary War under guerrilla fighter Francis Marion, \\"the swamp fox\\", and commander Nathaniel Greene to whom the family is related. The Pierces married into the \\"Cotton‚ÄìTaylor‚ÄìPerry\\" family in and around Bertie, County and Halifax, North Carolina. Grace5 Harrell (Ezekial4, John Harrell3 Jr*, John2 Harrell Sr, Thomas1) died before 1805 and married John Pearce. They had one child, Simon Pearce. The Pierces, Colliers, and Harrisons intermarried with several local prominent families throughout NC, including the Boyds and Grays of Winston- Salem. (The family is also related to famous and well documented Atkins, Calhoun and Clay families of the South). Following the Civil War, his direct descendants, Andrew Jackson Weeks, son of Gasanawy Fleming and Martha Harrison, married Nancy Pierce, daughter of Frank Pierce and Nancy Mims (Fort Mims) about 1870 in Lowery, AL, named for the Lowerys, although branches of the family are known to have already been living in Alabama and Mississippi and fought in the War of 1812, such as General Nathaniel Taylor (1771‚Äì1816). Andrew Jackson Weeks is the descendant of Mary Pope and Joseph Weeks of Pope Creek, near the childhood home of President George Washington. A relation to the famous Texas politician Andrew Jackson Weeks whose family also migrated from Georgia around the same time is likely, but they are not the same person.

Vines Collier, Jr. named his 13th child Cuthbert S., suggesting the connection is by marriage via his wife Sarah Elizabeth, daughter of Benjamin Williamson and the unknown mother. A name change by Cuthbert Collier's descendants is a popular speculation, although it seems incorrect. Benjamin Williamson's brother is Cuthbert Williamson. The Harrison family is documented to frequently have used the name Cuthbert since the 17th century, as well, therefore Cuthbert in this case likely signifies a given name. The families are connected through the marriages of William Adams and Elizabeth Fendin, who later married Daniel John Greene and more closely, his son, Nathaniel Adams who married Margaret Ellis in 1744. The Adams originated in Massachusetts and are related to ***Presidents John Adams and ***John Quincy Adams.

The marriage ended in divorce and Pierce Butler was arrested for treason upon visiting his family in NY after the outbreak of the Civil War. Grandson through marriage, last name was changed to Butler, to the founding father Pierce Butler. *** Descend from the most powerful US Irish Catholic political family, the Carrolls of Maryland, after the founding father, Charles Carroll of Carrollton.

The Colliers are an influential family in the current politics of Ohio and Michigan. The relationship exists, but some may be related to the family who also writes the political magazine Collier's. Note to African American ancestry researchers: Founding Father Pierce Butler fired his over-seer Roswell King of the Sea Island Plantations in Georgia due to his cruel treatment of the slaves. He also disinherited his only son for reasons unknown, but for this reason the plantation holdings transferred to Pierce (Mease) Butler from New York, who had little to no practical experience in running a plantation and was a very poor businessman. The son of Roswell King, Roswell King, Jr was hired as the over-seer in his place, but according to Fanny Kemble, wife of Pierce Mease Butler and Abolitionist, his treatment of the slaves was little better. Both Roswell King and his son sired man children with the slaves of the Sea Island Plantations. The Collier family and Kings are not related and did not intermarry, but the Kings also became wealthy and a prominent family in Georgia. Researchers may well find relations to leaders of Georgia through this ancestral line. Pierce (Mease) Butler was forced to sell around 450 slaves in the largest slave auction in US history to pay his debts. Valued at an inflation adjusted $25 billion, the slaves sold in this auction will be well documented. The Collinses * George W.

He eventually rose to the rank of admiral. Early life Little is known about Sawyer's early life, but he entered the navy in 1747, spending his first six years mostly on the Jamaica Station aboard George Townshend's HMS Gloucester.Herbert Sawyer at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He passed his lieutenant's examination on 30 August 1753, when his age was given as 'more than 22', suggesting he was born in or before 1730. He was promoted to lieutenant on 4 March 1756, and the following year was serving aboard HMS Grafton, which at the time was part of Vice- Admiral Francis Holburne's fleet off Louisbourg. Promotion to command He received his first command, that of the sloop HMS Happy on 19 October 1758, but was soon moved to HMS Swallow off the coast of France under the orders of Lord Howe. He took command of HMS Chesterfield on 26 December, followed with a transfer to HMS Active in February 1759. He spent the rest of the war aboard her. On 21 May 1762 he and the sloop HMS Favourite, the latter commanded by Philemon Pownoll, captured the Spanish treasure ship Hermione off Cadiz. A cargo of over ¬£500,000 in cash and bullion was secured, of which Sawyer received ¬£65,053 13s. 9d. Now extremely wealthy, he married the daughter of a Lisbon merchant. His next appointment came in 1777, with the command of HMS Boyne. He sailed with her the following year to join Rear-Admiral Samuel Barrington off the West Indies, and was present at the repulse of Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing's attempt to capture St Lucia on 15 December that year. Sawyer remained in the Caribbean, and was present at the Battle of Grenada as part of Vice-Admiral John Byron's fleet on 6 July 1779. Sawyer returned to England in the autumn, and was given command of HMS Namur in 1780. He commanded her in the English Channel, and was present at the relief of Gibraltar in April 1781. He left the Namur in December, and by 1783 he was in command of the guardship HMS Bombay Castle at Plymouth. On the North American Station Monument to Herbert Sawyer's daughter Sophia, d.1788 St. Paul's Church (Halifax), Nova Scotia He left the Namur in 1785 and was appointed commodore of the North American Station's base at Halifax. He took up his post in June, and authorized the frigate HMS Mercury to escort a merchant vessel to the American port of Boston to collect a shipment of cattle. This marked the first free visit of a British warship to the port since March 1776. In 1787 Sawyer had taken part of his fleet to Quebec, where he was embarrassed by a French squadron of three ships of the line and four frigates, which sailed unchallenged along the Nova Scotia coast bound for Boston. His daughter Sophia died in Halifax in 1788 and was buried in the crypt at St. Paul's Church (Halifax). Soon after he returned to England in August 1788. Further promotions Sawyer never returned to sea but continued to rise through the ranks based on his seniority. He was promoted to rear- admiral on 24 September 1788, vice-admiral on 1 February 1793 and admiral on 1 June 1795. Poor health meant he was unable to take up any commands. He died in Bath, Somerset, on 4 June 1798. His eldest son, also named Herbert Sawyer followed his father into a navy, and also had served in the American Revolution. He too reached the rank of admiral, and even was appointed to his father's old command on the North American Station, which he commanded during the War of 1812. Notes References *J. K.

The church was founded on July 14, 1831. They had their first meeting in a building on Third Street, between Elm and Plum Streets, downtown. The members built a church on Central Avenue and called Rev. David Leroy Nickens of Chillicothe, Ohio as its first pastor. By the end of its first decade, the church had grown sufficiently to require a new building and by 1839, moved to a new location on Baker Street, where they remained for twenty-five years. Nickens was succeeded by Rev. Charles Satchell in 1838, who in turn was succeeded by William P. Newman in 1848. When Newman fled to Canada because of the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, he was succeeded by Rev. Henry Adams, who served until 1855; Rev. H. L. Simpson, who served until 1858; and Rev. H. H. White who served three years. Williams returned in 1864, serving until his death in the 1866 cholera epidemic. Simpson returned to fill the vacancy, serving until 1869, when he was succeeded by Rev. James H. Magee. In 1864, Church members founded the Union Baptist Cemetery, in the Price Hill neighborhood. It is the oldest Baptist African-American cemetery in Cincinnati. In the 1960s, urban renewal forced the church to move from its longtime home at Richmond and Mound Streets. The Church moved to Seventh & Central Avenues in 1971, under the leadership of Rev. Wilber Page, longtime pastor. The church continues its work in the Cincinnati community.

It was located on an island in the Neman River near Lampƒód≈æiai, now part of the city of Kaunas. The Order built the castle after they failed to capture Vilnius, capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, in a five-week siege in September‚ÄìOctober 1390. It became the headquarters of Vytautas, future Grand Duke of Lithuania, while he fought in the Lithuanian Civil War (1389‚Äì92) against his cousin Jogaila, King of Poland. In spring 1392, Henry of Masovia, Bishop of P≈Çock, arrived to the castle to secretly negotiate an agreement between Vytautas and Jogaila. Here, about three weeks later, Henry married Rymgajla, Vytautas' sister, prompting many rumors and speculations. When the cousins reconciled, Vytautas turned against the Teutonic Order and burned Ritterswerder and two other Teutonic castles on the Neman River before returning to Vilnius. During a campaign in 1394, the Order attempted to rebuild the castle but did not complete it as they were attacked by the Lithuanians. The Order decided to abandon the construction and besiege Vilnius for the second time. When in 1404, Vytautas confirmed the Peace of RaciƒÖ≈º in Kaunas, the Grand Master issued several documents from the island but did not mention the castle. The island has since disappeared as the river changed its course during the ages. It is believed that the island is now a hill on the right bank of the Neman River in Lampƒód≈æiai.

Tayloe was a member of the House of Burgesses of Virginia 1774. *****John Tayloe III Captain of Dragoons, he went to Western Pennsylvania, to help put down the Whiskey Rebellion. In 1799, he was appointed Major of Light Dragoons, U. S. A. by President John Adams. When General Washington wrote to Tayloe a warm letter of congratulation, Tayloe hesitated to accept the commission as he had just been elected as a Federalist to the Senate of Virginia, and he feared, as he wrote to Washington, that if he resigned his seat, the place would be filled by an opponent of the administration. On 12 February 1799, Washington replied that he was inclined to believe his civil service would be more important than military service. Tayloe served in the Virginia House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia, as Delegate and Senator for a combined 9 years. On the breaking out of the War of 1812, Tayloe was made commander of the cavalry of the District of Columbia and saw active service. ******Benjamin Ogle Tayloe studied law under United States Attorney General Richard Rush.Watson, In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, 1872 When Rush was appointed Minister to Great Britain in 1817, Tayloe was an observer at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818. He traveled to Paris in the spring of 1819, where Minister to France Albert Gallatin introduced him to King Louis XVIII and Talleyrand. ******Edward Thornton Tayloe was private secretary to Mr. Joel Roberts Poinsett of South Carolina, Minister of Mexico. He was skilled in French, Italian and Spanish. In 1828 he became Secretary of Legation to William Henry Harrison, first Minister to Colombia. Since 1825 he had flooded the fledgling Department of State with recommendations from influential friends, including Poinsett, seeking his appointment to diplomatic service. Only six weeks after his return from Mexico, he was appointed by President John Quincy Adams. Before the party left for Bogota, President Adams was defeated by Andrew Jackson. Gen. Harrison and Edward Tayloe proceeded to Colombia, hoping the new administration would leave them in place. While they awaited the ship, Gen. Cordoba seized the opportunity of Simon Bolivar's absence to stage a revolt in Colombia. Bolivar's second in command blamed the Cordoba affair on the meddling of Harrison and Tayloe. Then an American adventurer in the employ of Bolivar's government saw an opportunity for his own advancement and spread the tale that Harrison and Tayloe had conspired with Cordoba in his attempted coup. A mutual friend of Harrison and Tayloe was imprisoned without charges or trial, and they returned to Virginia. Simon Bolivar had disappointed him with his aggression against Peru and his dictatorial tendencies, and Washington politics had topped everything off. In 1830 he became a County Magistrate, in King George County, Virginia. In 1840 he won the election with William Henry Harrison, but President Harrison died. Before his death, President Harrison confided to Benjamin Ogle Tayloe that he intended naming Edward Tayloe to the post of Treasurer of the United States. One account even states that Mr. Harrison caught his death while walking in the rain from St. John's Church to the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House with that information. *******William Tayloe Murphy Sr., Delegate in the Virginia House and Virginia State Treasurer.

Produced and distributed by Columbia Pictures, includes Italian newsreel footage of the Fascists‚Äô March on Rome in 1922, the Lateran Treaty between Italy and The Holy See, engineering projects in Italy and North Africa, and excerpts of speeches by Mussolini. The film was narrated by U.S. radio broadcaster Lowell Thomas. It was made with Mussolini's full co-operation, beginning with a caption stating: \\"This picture is dedicated to a man of the people whose deeds for his people will ever be an inspiration to all mankind\\". (Excerpted from Doherty's Pre- Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema, 1930‚Äì1934, Columbia University Press, 1999) A contributor to The Boston Globe wrote: \\"Mussolini rises above personality. He is a great figure, perhaps one of the greatest in the world today\\", but the film showed \\"only a glorified Mussolini\\". Hearst columnist Arthur Brisbane wrote: \\"Nicholas Schenck said every intelligent man should see the Columbia Pictures film of Mussolini speaking and in action. He is right. In the faces of the crowds and in their frenzied applause you see Mussolini's absolute hold on the people of Italy.\\" Brisbane thought it demonstrated the \\"role that talking pictures are destined to play in education\\".

Early life Joseph Brenan, was born in Cork on 17 November 1828. Brenan began to write verse at an early age, and was one of the genuine poets of the Young Ireland movement. His earlier poems were published under the initials \\"J. B., Cork,\\" or \\"J. B‚Äîn,\\" and some of his American verses under the pseudonym \\"Gondalez.\\" He was also an able prose writer. Brenan was an active member of the Cork Historical Society, and was one of the editors of the Cork Magazine, which appeared in November 1847, and continued to appear until the end of 1848, when the journal then ceased publication. Some of its contributors, who included Frazer, Martin MacDermott, Fitzjames O'Brien, Mulchinock and Mary Savage, would later either end up in jail or in exile. 1848 Rising In January 1848, John Mitchel visited Cork and, according to Michael Cavanagh, who would publish a sketch of his Brenan's life in Young Ireland, Dublin, in June and July 1885, Brenan for the first time \\"beheld the man he most admired on earth, and with whose future destiny, whether for weal or woe, he felt his own was bound up. Never had the arch-enemy of England a more faithful or earnest follower.\\" Brenan contributed to the Mitchel's United Irishman and, sold his rifle to obtain his train fare, to take up his residence in Dublin, the headquarters of the revolutionary movement. He later published articles in John Martin's Irish Felon urging the Confederate Clubs members, many of whom had arms to be in readiness for action. \\"The sooner you realise the fact,\\" he wrote in a Letter addressed to the Members of the Provincial Confederate Clubs, \\"that the Confederation was got up for the purpose of doing something, the better for us all. Just think what it undertook to do. It undertook to defeat the strongest Government and to liberate the most degraded country that ever existed. It undertook to give ‚Äì to a province‚Äîto strike the chains off millions of slaves and, if necessary, to wash out the, iron moulds in blood.\\" In another Letter to \\"the Young Men of Ireland\\" on 22 July 1848, he wrote: \\"On you I principally rely. You realise that you are very 'rash,' rather inclined to be 'violent,' and have exceedingly little prudence to spare. Brothers, let your watchword be 'Now or never‚Äînow and for ever' rashly\\" Brenan was associated with John Savage and John O'Mahony while Savage was operating on the slopes of the Comeragh Mountains. Brenan was arrested and kept in prison for seven months alternately in Newgate Prison, Carrickfergus and Kilmainham Gaols. During his confinement he wrote some fine poems, according to T. F. O'Sullivan, one, entitled \\"Yearnings,\\" evidently addressed to Mary Savage, sister of John. After his release without trial in March 1849, Brenan became editor of the Irishman which had been started in Dublin by Bernard Fulham, and for six months attempted to rekindle the insurrectionary flame in the country. He was implicated in the attack on the Cappoquin police barracks on 16 September 1848 and in October escaped to America. Escape to America In America he became associated with a number of journals, including Horace Greeley's Tribune, Devin Reilly's People, The Enquirer of Newark, Jersey, and the New Orleans Delta in which he wrote a series of papers under the pen-name Ben Fox. On 27 August 1851, Brenan married Mary Savage, in her parents house, on Thirteenth Street, New York. Brenan wrote some articles and poems for John Mitchel's Citizen in 1854. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Southern cause, and had founded the New Orleans Times. Death Joseph Brenan died on 27 May 1857, at the early age of twenty nine and was buried in the old French cemetery of New Orleans. During the last year of his life he was almost totally blind. He was attended in his last illness by Dr. Dalton Williams. There were seven children of the marriage, only one of whom, Florence, survived their parents. She possessed her father's literary ability, but devoted her life to religion as a member of the Mercy Order. Conclusion His best known poem, \\"Come to Me, Dearest,\\" was addressed to Mary Savage before their marriage. The love story of Joseph Brenan and \\"Mary\\" has been told in the sketch by Ellen Mary Patrick Downing, afterwards Sister Mary Alphonsus.

The prize-winning novel, The Twelve and the Genii tells what happens in the middle of the Twentieth century when a small boy in an old Yorkshire house discovers the twelve wooden soldiers that had once belonged to Branwell Bront√´ in the early years of the Nineteenth century. Branwell's playing with the soldiers has brought them to life, and now they want to go home. Can Max, the small boy, and his family help the Twelve? The Pekinese Princess, Clarke's first book, written so Cecil Leslie (living, then with Clarke) could illustrate her own two Pekinese dogs, is a long-ago fantasy of talking animals (and trees) in a fairy tale Chinese setting, a human-like world without humans, but referring to the Buddha. The fantasy ends with an apotheosis of immortality. The \\"merciful Jade Emperor ... picked up the kingdom by the four corners of the plain, as in a blanket, and planted it whole upon the mountain in the middle of the world, where the immortals dwell\\" (p 125). So they (almost) all live happily ever after, free of any further threat from wicked clever monkeys. \\"But some few Pekinese slipped out from the corners when the Lord of Heaven lifted the kingdom, and landed upon the earth again. These are they you see sometimes looking mournful ... for they are thinking with longing of their happy kingdom\\" (p 127). Smith's Hoard (1955), also known as The Golden Collar, appears to be a typical British school- holiday mystery story. Two children, brother and sister, are sent for the school holidays to their great-aunt who lives in the country. During their train trip they coincidentally meet a boastful young man who tells them he is a dealer in second-hand jewellery, and shows them a strange gold item. The older brother immediately recognises the item as half of a Celtic or Iron Age torc, a decorative gold filigree neck-collar. He also realises that such a piece ought to be in a museum. Later, spending time with teenage friends in their aunt's neighbourhood, the brother and sister find evidence of a recently discovered hoard of bronze artefacts, and also discover an ancient Celtic coin. Clearly something very mysterious is going on, possibly including secret and illegal archaeological digging, theft of historical artefacts, and even the haunting by the ghost of the Celtic smith who buried the hoard and died in tribal warfare. The story is narrated by the younger sister (with some help from her brother and his friend), and, by the end, the mystery is solved. There is much in this novel that prefigures further developments in Clarke's fiction. One of Clarke's historical novels Torolv the Fatherless (1959), Pauline Clarke's own favourite among her books. In her research for the book, amongst many resources, she used Anglo-Saxon historical material of the Cambridge academic Peter Hunter Blair. The story of Torolv works around \\"The Battle of Maldon\\", an Anglo-Saxon or Old English poem. This commemorates a bitter defeat at Maldon in Essex by Danish raiders in 991, led by a Viking called Anlaf, who is possibly Olaf Tryggvason, later the king of Norway, and himself a character in the Icelandic Heimskringla Saga. At the end of the book, Clarke includes her own translation of the poem. Clarke's The Boy With the Erpingham Hood (1956), contemporaneous with Cynthia Harnett's historical novels of the same historical era (Plantagenet England in the early Fifteenth century), is the story of Simon Forester, a fictitious boy, involved with real characters and events leading to the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Clarke could also write about modern children. Her realistic contemporary novel (once \\"contemporary\\", now creeping towards being \\"historical\\") Keep the Pot Boiling (1961) is about a vicar's family. Their efforts to amuse themselves constructively resemble the earlier family novels of Edith Nesbit, and the contemporaneous Rumer Godden and Noel Streatfeild. Remarkably, the vicar suffers from what we would now call bipolar disorder, which means his children often have to deal with his black depressive moods. But it is a happy story. Fantasy, historical, and realist do not exhaust the genres of Clarke's major work. Her last children's novel The Two Faces of Silenus (1972) is that special kind of fantasy made popular by Alan Garner, where mythology from the past irrupts into a modern realistic setting. Visiting Italy with their parents, while their father attends a historians' conference, Rufus and Drusilla set free the ancient god-satyr Silenus, and his enemy Medusa. In Silenus Clarke evokes the feeling of a modern provincial Italian town: exotic, slightly operatic, cobbled and more brightly painted than an English counterpart, with detectable layers of older medieval and Roman ages; all of this set amongst the enduring landscape of fields, groves, and forests of antiquity, bursting with plant and animal life, immediate and fresh, with an almost evanescent sense of being haunted by a darker underlevel of ancient mythology. In fact the story grew from Clarke's visit with her historian husband to Spoleto. Seven years after writing Torolv the Fatherless, Clarke married the historian Peter Hunter Blair in 1969. She edited his history Anglo-Saxon Northumbria (1984) and later wrote for adults as Pauline Hunter Blair. The first published was The Nelson Boy (1999), a painstakingly- researched historical reconstruction of Horatio Nelson's childhood.. Naval History (reviews by title, Man to Pol). Gazelle Book Services. Archived 21 July 2007. Retrieved 6 October 2013. She followed with a sequel about his early voyages. Warscape (Church Farm House Books, Bottisham, 2002), written when Pauline Hunter Blair was in her late 70s, was her first novel for an adult audience. Pauline Hunter Blair, at that time, unmarried Pauline Clarke, was a young woman of 22 in 1943, and it is to this experience of a young woman during the last years of World War II that she returns for a sustained ‚Äúscape‚Äù of the war. It would be interesting to know what Hunter Blair's own wartime experience was. However, based on the details and emotions her writing evokes, we can speculate that aspects of this novel are actually autobiographical. (The Wikipedia article on Pauline Hunter Blair notes that after completing degree-studies in English at Somerville College, Oxford ‚Äì where he lecturers may have included J.R.R. Tolkien C.S. Lewis ‚Äì she then worked as a journalist and wrote for children's magazines. But was this her wartime work, or her post-war work before she began her career as children's author in 1948, with the charming Oriental dog-fantasy romp, The Pekinese Princess. The novel's title, Warscape, suggests a descriptive topographical painting or landscape, of wartime, showing the shape and distant vistas of a widespread territory. Hunter Blair's novel is, indeed, a ‚Äúscape‚Äù of (some years of) the war, largely from the points of view of British civilians in England and other parts of Britain. It is largely concerned with the fighting in Europe, but continually aware of much more. Some of the Renaissance oil paintings of Pieter Breugel (the Elder) provide a similar large-scale view of humanity. A large canvas, with a cohort of main characters seen in close-up at the foreground of the vista, with lesser figures, and different actions glimpsed in the middle- ground, and yet others seen, as if in miniature, but just as significant, in the distance. Beginning auspiciously on All Saints Day, 1 November 1943, Warscape focuses on the experiences of Laura Cardew, a young woman recently graduated from Oxford University, and now recruited into the secret world of wartime Intelligence ‚Äì her long-awaited war-work. She soon finds herself as part of the office-based Intelligence team analysing the multitude of reports from secret agents and Resistance workers and spies in Europe, warning of the dangers of the anticipated German revenge weapon, the V1 ‚Äúbuzz bomb‚Äù or ‚Äúdoodlebug‚Äù. (This was a pilot-less pulse-jet bomb, broadly similar to a modern cruise-missile, but with no computer-navigation or guidance, only a gyroscopic compass and auto-pilot to provide direction and flight-stability. An unguided missile a terror weapon!) But this is NOT a thriller, or an adventure story: it has no moonlight parachute drops into France, no Resistance fighters, Sten guns, or Gestapo, and spies. Nor is the novel a Back-Room Boys exploration of the machinations of wartime Intelligence, and photo reconnaissance ‚Äì although this is mentioned, as a passing detail (p 14). Instead, like the larger everyday figures in a Breugel landscape, the close focus of the story is the lives, loves, confusions, anguishes and sufferings of civilians in Britain ‚Äì Laura, her family, her work friends, and other contacts. Yet, in several ways, the novel chronicles the major events of the war, from October 1943 through to the first Christmas of the hard-won peace, in December 1945. We hear, successively, of Allied air force attacks on German ball-bearing factories, the revelation of the brutal Russian massacre of Polish officers in the Katyn Forest, the stalled Allied offensive in Italy, Anzio and the destruction of the monastery at Monte Cassino, the V1 bombardment of south east England, the Warsaw Uprising, and so on, up to the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, the Battle of the Bulge, the deaths of Mussolini, and then Hitler, Buchenwald and the wider Holocaust of Jews, and the three atom bombs exploded at Alamogordo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The campaigns in the Far East are also referred to: Slim in Burma, Macarthur preparing to invade the Philippines, and then Okinawa. (Readers unfamiliar with World War II would need good footnotes, reference books, or web-searches to explain the significance of these Breugellian background details. Background, maybe, but NOT insignificant!) Hunter Blair even acknowledges that for the Chinese, the fighting with the Japanese began in the summer of 1937 ‚Äì two years before war broke out in Europe (p 228)! The foreground narratives of civilians provide sensitive portraits of Laura, her romantically unhappy mother, her religiously bigoted and twisted father, her sister and her sister's fianc√© ‚Äì both serving in the Army. Through the novel, Laura is suffering from a profound undergraduate crush on one of her university teachers ‚Äì who is married and has a son. He has lightly, unthinkingly, encouraged her feelings, without taking any unfair advantage of her. But she cannot forget him! The eventual resolution of this recurrent, and complex plot element is one of the great rewards of the novel. In the Intelligence office, Laura meets a motley collection of colleagues married woman, single women, intellectual men and engineers (one of them a Communist sympathiser and would- be experimental novelist), European refugees, and others ‚Äì typical of the ad hoc back-room teams who worked together to contribute, in whatever small ways, to the eventual defeats of Nazi Germany, and then Imperial Japan. One of these colleagues is the similarly recently graduated Prudence Kyle, whose family we also meet. Yet this is no civilian soap opera. These are all real people, vividly and appealingly realised in a succession of vignettes, like a huge album of photographic snapshots, or a collage of images, with idiosyncrasies and beliefs and feelings. Warscape also contains pervasive themes of religious belief, and disbelief, ranging from the puritan and evangelical (Calvinist, in origin) Wee Free Scottish Church, to the traditional Roman Catholic, and even humanistic atheism, and Marxist materialism. Prudence's father, Edwin, conceals his political cynicism and disbelief within his acerbic diary entries, as he comments on political and military news. He had been intellectually scarred by his childhood within the ultraconservative Wee Free movement. Laura's father has been similarly emotionally crippled by his Calvinist or splinter-sect upbringing, resulting in obsessive guilt-driven extreme sectarian pamphlet writing, and the fundamental ruin of his marriage. Given his twisted puritanism (blighted by doctrines of Original Sin) it is amazing that he actually sired any children at all ‚Äì or even married! Despite this, he remains an emotionally sensitive figure, loved, and also pitied, by his estranged wife and daughter. Naturally, tragically, amidst years of war, with family members and friends posted to distant theatres of operation, and almost random air-raid casualties amongst the civilians on the Home Front, the impacts of death, and the seemingly random brutality of warfare, and the Nazi savagery of concentration camps, haunt the minds ‚Äì and fears of the many characters of the novel. Despite this, mothers, fathers, and sisters, lovers and friends face their waking hours, and sleeping nightmares, with stoic, taciturn courage. (Partly this is classic British stiff upper-lip of that era. It is also the inspirational wartime refusal to indulge in anything that might weaken morale collectively and individually. The sense that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äù is palpable.) Just as naturally, the narratives include sex, or some small-scale mention of physical relations between men and women ‚Äì as well as open, accepting acknowledgement of homosexuality (at a time when repressive laws put sexually active gay men in prison!). Writing as a septuagenarian, remembering young wartime women (and, surely, herself) in their twenties, Hunter Blair is surprisingly open. But she always writes (discreetly ‚Äì this is not Lady Chatterly's Lover or 50 Shades of Gray) about sex from the perspective of young, university-trained women, and their similarly raised young men, of that era. Na√Øve, idealistic, romantic, but not cloistered. Laura has encounters with other would-be boyfriends, including her level-headed Canadian friend, Tom, cousin of one of Laura's undergraduate female friends. Tom would pursue Laura far more seriously, romantically, if she were not fixated on the married academic. Instead he remains objective, philosophical, protective, caring, and respectful ‚Äì he is a good friend! (He works as an industrial chemist, but hopes to become an experimental dramatist after the war.) Interestingly, Tom frankly declares ‚ÄúI‚Äôd hate to marry a virgin‚Äù (p 142), contrary to the traditional double-standard that allows unmarried men to sow their wild oats but to insist on marrying a virgin, while regarding the unmarried women they sow their wild oats with, or other women who are also sexually active, as sluts or worse. Another would-be boyfriend is Hubert Cox (Chapter 13, pp 130‚Äì136). He is known to Laura from childhood when they were passengers on the same school bus, and later as teenagers, through mutual family acquaintances. Now, clever, musical, literary, and scientifically trained, he is working on radar (although at that time the British referred to it as ‚Äúradio location‚Äù, rather than using the American term that had not yet become the standard word). Laura encounters him again, unexpectedly, while using some of her recreation leave ‚Äì use it or lose it. They see Ralph Richardson performing on stage in Ibsen's poetic play Peer Gynt. They discuss the love of Solveig, the girl Peer Gynt leaves behind when he explores the world. Hubert confesses his love for Laura. He also confesses his physical longing for her, and almost begs her to have sex with him, trying to convince her my saying that ‚Äúeverybody needs sex ‚Ä¶ young adult males need a full orgasm several times a week at least, ‚Ä¶‚Äù (his emphasis). Laura replies that he sounds like a sex manual. (Indeed!) Yet another sort-of boyfriend is Rees, a tough Welsh soldier, waiting for his unit to be part of the D-Day Normandy invasion (pp 103‚Äì105). Laura meets him at her older sister's wedding. Rees is the best- man, and supposed to be engaged to another woman. But he pursues Laura, kissing her passionately, fumbling inside her clothes, and on one unconsummated occasion, stripping off her rain-soaked clothes and kissing her cold breasts while pressing his naked body against her. ‚ÄúThis was her first uninhibited encounter with what [Laura‚Äôs] cousin Sylvia would call with exaggerated laughter the male organ‚Äù. Frank, physical, but ultimately, inexperienced, incomplete, and chaste. Later, when Rees's engagement to another woman is confirmed, Laura is retrospectively upset by her experiences with him. She gloomily explains some of this to Tom: ‚ÄúWell, he [Rees] was simply having a bit of fun, and I ‚Ä¶ let him‚Äù. Tom replies, smiling, ‚ÄúCome on, Laura, it is fun, it‚Äôs meant to be fun, not frightening‚Äù (p 112). By contrast, Laura's friend Prudence, after a squashed but jolly train trip with a group of soldiers (an example of the typical camaraderie of young people thrown together during war-time, overcoming the usual polite silence of strangers thrust together on public transport), is pursued too eagerly by a sex-starved soldier waving a handful of ready condoms at her ‚Äì Laura sees them as ‚Äúsmall white balloons ‚Äì supposedly to reassure her. She runs, then suddenly turns, and hits him with her small suitcase (referred to, using a now obsolete term, as a ‚Äúgrip‚Äù), knocking him down, and then fleeing. She knows she is in danger, and thinks it may be sexual, but does not fully understand (pp 73‚Äì77). Perhaps surprisingly, Laura immediately understands and explains the ‚Äúsmall white balloons‚Äù. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, as the war grinds on in the East, Daisy, a minor character (typist and inept tea-maker in the Intelligence office), is informed that her husband has died of his wounds in Burma. We are told, ‚ÄúDaisy had married hurriedly, innocently, before her boyfriend left, a young prudish girl. They had only two nights to consummate it. They had not got very far. Daisy remembered pain, discomfort and shyness‚Äù (pp 210‚Äì211). She feels that she is ‚Äúnot really Mrs Anything‚Äù, and has experienced a ‚Äúghost marriage‚Äù. Sex is acknowledged, as a natural part of wartime human experience, but it is not prominent or explicit, and does not actually occur (except off- stage). Interestingly, the narrative acknowledges that later, after the war, and after the events of the novel, the prevailing wartime social ideas of personal privacy, sexual morals, and decency, will be swept away by sexual liberty and public frankness, ‚Äúas permissiveness broke the last dams of puritanism‚Äù (pp 68‚Äì69). Tom suggests to Laura that she ‚Äúpursue one of [her] friendships to its natural conclusion and have an affair. It might turn into a meaningful relationship‚Äù. The narrator notes that this is the first time Laura has heard the expression, but ‚Äúit was to become a clich√© as society proceeded towards permissiveness‚Äù (pp 141‚Äì142). Through most of the novel there is no clear sense of a ‚Äúnarrator‚Äù. But occasionally the here-and-now description of people and events lurches into the future, observing aspects of the way society, morals and politics will change after the war, and in our own modern times. I am reminded of the ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù device used by Norman Mailer in his sprawling World War II novel The Naked and the Dead, about the capture of a Japanese-held Pacific island, and America during the Great Depression that led up to the war. Mailer's narrative gimmick is itself borrowed from John Dos Passos's use of ‚ÄúNewsreels‚Äù structural sections of his vast novel, containing newspaper headlines and newspaper articles and other non-fiction details in his sprawling 1930s novel U.S.A. But Hunter Blair uses her implicit time- machine to look forward beyond the war years‚Äô chronology of her novel ‚Äì evoking, in snippets, contrasts between Britain's, and the Western world's values of wartime, and our own later, more relaxed and less puritan era. Touchingly, this speaking-of-now-and-observing-the future includes an encounter between civilian Prudence and an RAF fighter pilot. They happen to meet on the upper-deck of a London bus, when she sits beside him on the last empty seat. He opens the conversation, apologising for his bulky RAF overcoat taking up too much room. ‚ÄúAnd what do you [Prudence] do, in this battle to the death? Forgive me, I always talk to people, do you mind? It feels a waste not to.‚Äù They chat. Quickly the talking becomes profound as, amongst other things, he declares that he knows his ‚ÄúRedeemer liveth‚Äù, but he is not proselytising, only speaking from the heart. They chat further, mentioning the latest West End theatre hit Arsenic and Old Lace (later, a 1944 Hollywood screwball comedy film starring Cary Grant). The pilot asks Prudence about her plans for after the war ‚Äì continuing her research work in Twelfth century history. The popular RAF pilot and war poet, John Pudney, is quoted. As she gets off at her bus- stop, he thanks her for the talk and thinks, ‚ÄúWhen I die ‚Ä¶ as I assuredly must soon, this luck can‚Äôt go on, I shall remember you, golden girl, you and your companions for whom I fight. (But when it came to it, there was not time, he remembered only his parents and his God)‚Äù. (pp 26‚Äì29). The vignette, and its parenthetical observation, is typical of so much in this fine novel. One further feature of Warscape deserves attention. Frequently, and diversely, the characters ‚Äì almost all of them reasonably well educated middle-class people ‚Äì quote, mention, or allude to a wide range of authors, literature, music, history, and culture. Dickens, Tolstoy, Mozart, Bach, Ibsen, Shakespeare, Tennyson, Freud, Plato, Jung, Locke, Bunyan, Lewis Carroll, Dylan Thomas, Sassoon, Coleridge, ... Similarly, many famous and popular people of that era are mentioned, including John Pudney, Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson, Myra Hess (pianist), C.E.M. Joad (famous on the radio show Brains Trust), C.S. Lewis (when his wartime writing and radio talks on Christianity were popular, but before he became a best-seller children's fantasy author), Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears, the ‚ÄúPunch‚Äù cartoonist and patriotic war-poster artist Fougasse, ... A large shared cultivated culture informs the ideas and lives of Hunter Blair's characters. The overall effect is of a tapestry, full of detail, a panorama or landscape ‚Äì indeed, a ‚Äúwarscape‚Äù, as the title make clear. Several characters are prominent, especially Laura, Prudence, Tom, and Laura's university academic heart-throb. This is not a book that tells us new things about the lived experience of World War II. But it is a rich, vivid picture of what civilian life was like ‚Äì its dangers, privations, fears and heartaches ‚Äì seen within the much larger, distant context of the war. (But not always distant: Laura and her mother, in their house are hit by, but survive a nearby V1 explosion. One of Laura's work-colleagues is also trapped in a bomber cellar after a V1 hits! Relatives and friends die!) Written in her early 80s, and self-published, with minor typos and editorial slips, Jacob‚Äôs Ladder (Church Farmhouse Books, Bottisham, 2003) is a novel of village life, with a cast of mainly middle-aged people experiencing their approach to old- age, final illnesses, the death of partners, and the struggle to make sense of life and rebuild human contact and love. The story includes one murder, one suicide, two deaths, two remarriages and one marriage, and continual reflections on being human, while also being aware of DNA, black holes, mental illness (depression and paranoid schizophrenia), sexuality and sexual expression and love, and creativity. One of the characters is a poet and university academic, another is a playwright preparing to begin a novel which, in some ways, is Jacob‚Äôs Ladder itself, although the would-be novelist does not get beyond a visual sketch of the story. The novel is threaded through with quotations and references to Egyptian mythology, notably Thoth, the ibis- headed god of knowledge, truth and justice, as well as the Metaphysical poet Thomas Traherne, and the Renaissance renegade monk Giordano Bruno, and the Hermetic writings, along with many other literary, musical, and artistic motifs. Religious belief and mysticism, agnosticism, and atheism are important issues. The final sentences of the would-be novelist's sketch conclude this philosophical novel: \\"After the ravages of death, life flowed in. ‚Ä¶ As the sea flows in at high tide, and absconds again, screeching down the shingle, stealing away with generations of sins\\" (p344). She died on 23 July 2013 at the age of 92.

It was based on tacit anti-Labour co-operation between the Unionist Party, Scottish Liberals and independents. Origins National political parties were rarely active in local politics but the rise of Labour Party led to a process of party politicisation of local government. However, at first Labour were opposed by the Progressives before other national political parties entered local government elections on a significant scale. The Progressives formed as a loose alliance of unofficial Liberals, Unionists and independents. Apart from a distinct focus on their urban localities the other essence of the Progressive groupings was opposition to Labour policies and control, plus a desire to avoid splitting the anti-Labour vote. History Progressive groupings formed in Edinburgh Corporation in 1928 and Glasgow Corporation in 1936 before spreading to other cities and towns. Their members were mainly drawn from local middle-class businessmen opposed to the introduction of what they saw as municipal socialism and Labour control. They dominated Scottish local politics for almost 50 years and as late as 1972 Edinburgh Corporation was made up of 21 Progressives, nine Conservatives, 33 Labour and five Liberals. However, by the end of the 1970s they had completely disappeared as the entry of Scottish National Party, Liberal and Conservative candidates into local politics supplanted their role of opposing Labour.

I respect him and wish nothing but the best for him. Max quitting Escape the Fate was like a godsend. It was a no brainer to have him join. I've known him half my life and this will be a great new chapter to start.\\" Green adds: ‚ÄúReuniting with longtime friend Ronnie Radke in his band Falling in Reverse feels nothing but right at this time in my life. I look to forward to playing shows and creating memories together again with him and his amazing band of bros.‚Äù On June 11, 2014, the band covered the Green Day song, \\"She's A Rebel\\", for a Kerrang! tribute album.

The da Camino (also known as Camino or Caminesi) were an Italian noble family whose fame is connected to the mediaeval history of the March of Treviso, a city of which they were lords for a while. History Of Lombard origin, the da Camino descend most likely from the Colalto family, with one Guitcillo or Guicillo who is named in relationship with a castle in 958 at Montanara. His son Guido (Guidone) inherited this castle, placed long the road connecting Veneto to Friuli, in reward for having saved the life of the German king Conrad I. Guido was also created count of Montanara. His sons Alberto and Guecello received by the bishop of Ceneda further lands in the plain between the Piave and Livenza, in particular near Oderzo, where they built a castle. From the name of the place, now Camino frazione of Oderzo, they took their future name. Thanks to further acquisitions from bishops and emperors, within a century the Caminesi extended their power over the comitates of Ceneda, Feltre, Belluno as well as in the areas of Cadore and Comelico. At this time they acquired, amongst others, a castle in the village of Cison di Valmarino, now known as Castelbrando. After a short period of decline in which the commune of Treviso was able to reduce them at the condition of simple citizens (1183‚Äì1199), they soon gained a great authority in the March of Treviso and became the leader of the Guelphs in the region. This made them the main enemies of the Ghibellines Da Romano. In 1235 and 1239 the da Camino managed to obtain the rule in Treviso, but the second time they were betrayed by Alberico da Romano, who expelled the Guelphs from the city. However, with Gherardo III da Camino the Guelphs regained prominence. Gherardo was made seignor of the city in 1283. He tried to expand his power in Friuli against the Patriarchate of Aquileia, but with poor results. He was more notable as a builder and administrator, as well as patron of the arts (Dante Alighieri being among his guests). His son Rizzardo peacefully inherited his charge. However, after a short period of occupation of Udine (1309), the subsequent defeat and the shift to the Ghibelline party caused the quick collapse of the family's fortunes. His son Guecellone was soon ousted from Treviso, ending forever the da Camino's rule there, while within twenty years (1335) their lands were all acquired by the Republic of Venice. A lesser branch continued to have a role in the Venetian nobility until 1422, when they also lost all the lands in the Veneto. After a period of residence in Germany, the da Camino established themselves in Cordignano (c. 1604) and, from the late 18th century, in Trieste and Turin. Some descendants currently live in Brazil and Peru. The da Camino family still have descendants in the Cadore region of Northern Italy. The Vecellio family of Cadore are descended from the da Camino family through their common ancestor/founder Vecile da Camino who was a direct descendant of Guecello da Camino who lived in the 11th Century. The Vecellio family produced the famous Renaissance artist Titian (Tiziano Vecellio).

The tondo, painted in Florence between the years of 1490 and 1500, addresses a central theme of the Italian Renaissance art: the divine motherhood. The work is now in the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art.  Background and iconography  The iconography of the Madonna with the infant Jesus is one of the most recurrent themes throughout art history. Its origin goes back to the hieratic representations of the High Middle Ages where Mary, crowned, enthroned or standing, presents the divine infant in her arms. The painters of the Italian Renaissance contributed to the widespread representation of the \\"Virgin of Tenderness\\", characterized by a more emotional and humane representation of this theme, rather than the strictly sacred approach given by the Byzantine art. In the words of Marcio Doctors, the Renaissance Madonnas mark \\"the Renaissance spirit which it characterizes: faith in mankind, as subjectivity, placing it in the center of the world. Both the Renaissance and the maternal love embrace the man in the same way when they make the world revolve around him\\".Doctors, 2004, p. 40. Botticelli produced a large number of Madonnas during the decades of 1480 and 1490. A considerable part consisted of tondi, in which the artist portrayed Mary, the Divine Child and the Infant Saint John the Baptist in worship. The tondi (tondo, singular) were works of art in circular shape (paintings or sculptures), mostly of sacred or historical themes. They were much appreciated in the 15th century and often ordered by patrons and guilds to decorate palaces or for use as objects of private devotion.  Painting  The MASP painting is unanimously dated in the last decade of the 15th century, based on similarities with other works from this period, in which one perceives a change in pictorial style of the author. We emphasize the beautiful structure of the composition, in which the figures of the Virgin and Child stand boldly inside the tondo, hereby freeing himself from the elegant symmetry of his youth. The same compositional clearance can be noted in the details of the angled seat, upon which rests the book Magnificat, supported on the frame of the painting in an almost illusionist fashion. It is equally noteworthy the remarkable intensification of the emotional bond that unites Mary and baby Jesus, unusual in Madonnas executed by the painter in his youth.Marques, 1998, pp. 53‚Äì56. The Italian art historian Roberto Longhi notes that the drawing of the scene is structured through \\"cross and radial lines\\" and not by \\"arching flexible lines\\", which places the work in the aforementioned context of freer composition that marks the maturing style of the painter in the late 15th century. Antonino Santangelo emits a similar opinion, noting that the \\"free and harmonious intertwining of hands and faces, mobility and precision recall the works of Botticelli shortly before 1500\\". In fact, it is possible to list at least a dozen productions by Botticelli, all of the last decade of the century, similar in composition to the work of MASP, the closest being the tondo that is conserved at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts, identical to the title of this work and also dated around 1490.Mandel, 1967, p. 109.  Attribution  The authorship of the work in question merited a detailed analysis of Roberto Longhi in 1947. In a letter to Pietro Maria Bardi, now in the MASP archives, the Italian historian claims that it is possible to observe in the tondo \\"undoubtedly the hand of Botticelli.\\" His opinion was corroborated by Antonino Santangelo, who said, \\"one can recognize the direct intervention on the painting by Botticelli\\". The attribution to Botticelli's work was later confirmed by other experts, including Miklos Boskovits and Yukio Yashiro. Nevertheless, most critics seem to agree that a part of the landscape in the background and the figure of St. John the Baptist would have been performed by an auxiliary in the studio of Botticelli, based on clear difference in style compared to the figure of the Virgin and Child. Roberto Longhi believes that the drawings of the landscape and the Infant Saint John the Baptist are more typical of Ghirlandaio and proposes the name of Bartolomeo di Giovanni ‚Äì disciple of both painters ‚Äì as a possible contributor to the implementation of the Botticelli tondo. Antonino Santangelo, in turn, credits the implementation of the auxiliary figure of Saint John the Baptist to Raffaelino de 'Carli.  Provenance  Originally, the work decorated the Palace Capponi of Florence, designed by Lorenzo di Bicci in 1410 by order of Niccol√≤ da Uzzano. In the 19th century, the tondo became part of the private collection of the wealthy English merchant Thomas Blayds in Liverpool. Later, the work was sold to Lord Wigan, Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, thus remaining in England. On October 2 of 1947, the work was acquired by the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art with funds donated by Mrs. Sinha Junqueira, businesswoman and patron from Ribeir√£o Preto.

They also provide health care, advocacy, job training, reentry services, and legal aid support. The group has satellite offices in Albany, New York, Brooklyn, New York, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and New Orleans. =Bookstore Cafe & Bar= Housing Works Cafe and Bookstore in SoHo, New York City Founded in 1994 and located in Soho on Crosby St, the bookstore cafe is a successful entrepreneurial business raising money to support the Housing Works mission. Run primarily by a team of specially trained volunteers, the bookstore is funded entirely by donations, and resells both in the retail space and online. Free and ticketed events occur throughout the week, and the space is available for privately rented parties, lectures, and is a very popular wedding destination. Events range from story time and sing a long for babies, a middle-grade book group, storytelling, trivia, screenings, activist talks, comedy, music, and performance (artists include Iron and Wine, Bjork, The Black Keys, Conor Oberst, and more), and many literary events celebrating established writers and new talent. The venue hosts twice-monthly editions of The Moth StorySLAM. The Cafe & bar is fully licensed to sell beer, wine, liquor, and hot and cold drinks in addition to a range of food items. The space has been featured in numerous movies and TV episodes, most recently Law & Order SVU. =Thrift shops= Housing Works is well-known to New Yorkers for its chain of upscale thrift shops. The New York Times has mentioned the shops in its neighborhood reviews. Housing Works Thrift Shop is featured in Seinfeld episode 173, \\"The Bookstore\\". George is forced to buy a book from Brentano's Bookstore because he took it in the restroom. He then tries to donate it to Housing Works Thrift Shop and claim a $200 tax write off but the clerk at the thrift shop used to work for Brentano's so she recognizes the book has been flagged that it has been in the restroom and runs him out of the store. =Haiti earthquake relief= In early 2010, Housing Works became involved in providing assistance to victims of Haiti's earthquake, especially those living with HIV/AIDS, by re-building three health clinics. Housing Works CEO Charles King auctioned off his trademark pony tail, and one bidder was Evangelical preacher Rick Warren. When Housing Works relief workers were forced to \\"abandon eight carry on bags filled with relief supplies\\" due to high fees, Delta Air Lines agreed to ship the supplies for free. =Advocacy= Housing Works is involved in advocating for health care reform and affordable housing. In October 2019, Housing Works organized a mass demonstration outside of the Supreme Court in support of LGBTQ civil rights, resulting in over 100 activists being arrested. Controversies =Union busting= In late-2019 and into 2020, Housing Works leadership began engaging in what many progressive leaders and labor organizations classify as union busting after the staff began a worker-led unionization effort to address a host of issues (such as workplace safety, benefits, and a lack of a living wage for many workers while some of the organization's executives receive six-figure salaries) impacting staff and the quality of service they provide to their community. Despite their assertion that they are not anti-union, Housing Works has retained a known \\"union busting\\" firm, Seyfarth Shaw LLP, \\"which prides itself as keeping workplaces 'union-free,' according to its website, and has a history of cases that include working against the 1960s agricultural labor activist Cesar Chavez and defending Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs film company against a slew of sexual harassment claims.\\" See also * Women's Interagency HIV Study References External links * Category:Organizations based in New York City Category:HIV/AIDS organizations in the United States Category:LGBT health organizations in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in New York City Category:Recycling in New York City Category:Waste management infrastructure of New York City ","title":"Housing Works"},{"id":"18197404","text":"Charles Mathias √âdouard SimonisMersch (1952), p. 504 (21 September 1818 ‚Äì 1 November 1875) was a Luxembourgian politician and jurist.

He took a liking to Matt and Luke Goss, twin friends of his son Chris when they were pupils together at Collingwood School in Camberley, Surrey. Although the twins were only 15, they had formed their own pop group called Gloss with the bassist Craig Logan. Realising the blond looks of Matt and Luke could be exploited to market a group that could be the Eighties' answer to the Bay City Rollers, Herbert offered Gloss advice and provided rehearsal space for them in his summer house. He introduced them to songwriters, financed their early demo tapes and plotted their route to success. =Spice Girls= By mid-1994, the Herberts and Murphy had auditioned 600 applicants, and whittled the line-up down to Melanie Brown, Geri Halliwell, Victoria Adams, Lianne Morgan, quickly replaced by Melanie Chisholm and Michelle Stephenson, quickly replaced by Emma Bunton. The Spice Girls were however first called Touch but Spice was considered much better. Therefore, the spice girls got their own names. Victoria was Posh, Mel C was Sporty, Mel B was Scary, Geri was Ginger and Emma was Baby. In 1997, the Herberts reverted to their original boy-band masterplan. \\"We decided to put an ad in The Stage newspaper, as we had done when we were auditioning for the Spice Girls,\\" recalled Bob Herbert of 5ive. =Personal life and death= Herbert was married to Ann and had one son, Chris Herbert and one daughter, Nicky. On 9 August 1999, Herbert was driving his red MG F through Windsor Great Park in Berkshire. Suddenly, due to heavy rain, he lost control. The car spun and collided with another car, a silver Toyota Corolla. Herbert's car then collided with a wooden fence around the park. Herbert had to be cut from his car by fire and rescue teams, and was taken to Wexham Park Hospital, Slough, by air ambulance, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

His work mainly concerns peptide activity and pharmacology. He is the founder and president of the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies (TPIMS), a biomedical research institute. Houghten pioneered the \\"tea-bag\\" approach of producing peptides for pharmacological work. He is author of over five hundred scientific papers, 38 of which have been cited at least one hundred times. His h-index is over 60. Biography Houghten received his PhD in organic chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1975. He had previously received a BS in chemistry from California State University, Fresno and an M.S. in Chemistry from Berkeley. He held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, then an assistant professorship at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, City University of New York, and then joined the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, working with Richard Lerner. Houghten branched out to the business world in the 1980s, forming Multiple Peptide Systems in 1986, the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies (TPIMS) in 1988 and Houghten Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 1990. =Awards= * Vincent du Vigneaud Award for Excellence in Peptide Science (2000) * American Chemical Society's Ralph F.

Richardson Entrepreneurship Program's 2011 Entrepreneur of the Year Work in combinatorial biology Combinatorial biology is the generation of large numbers of molecules (usually peptides, enzymes or other polypeptides in biology) with non-natural metabolic pathways. The resulting set of molecules is referred to as a library. Because traditional methods of chemical discovery and selection relied on \\"natural\\" pathways (those formed by sources found in the wild and brought into the library), creation of the requisite number of peptides for new drug discovery was impractical. New drugs needed to be built from specific combinations of proteins among the trillions of possible combinations. Synthetic avenues for peptide generation became an important venue for drug creation in the 1980s. In 1985, Houghten's most cited paper (cited 650 times, according to Scopus) published his method for the synthesis of massive numbers of peptides‚Äîenough for practical use in pharmacological work‚Äîin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This method was referred to as the \\"tea-bag\\" method because deprotected peptides are enclosed in mesh bags and dipped quickly into liquid solutions containing activated amino acids (or other organic compounds). The peptide is thus elongated one amino acid at each step, and by careful movement of each teabag, a series of related peptides can be made. By another variation, \\"split and mix\\", tens of millions of very diverse peptides can be made, and then assayed by some technique. Very precise deconvolution of the results, or alternatively, marking the peptide beads, can correlate sequence and activity. This allowed \\"[the capture of] information in a day that you couldn't get in a hundred years before\\" according to Houghten. The problem of generating and sequencing large libraries of peptides suitable for pharmaceutical work remained. Selection and identification of specific desired molecular traits (e.g. antigen response, antimicrobial response) required a selection algorithm and process. In 1991, he and his colleagues published one of the major papers in combinatorial biology‚Äîthe paper described a method to generate peptides capturable to contemporary protein microarrays through the creation of synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries (SPCL). Houghten continued his work in combinatorial biology with an article in Methods, the journals section of Methods in Enzymology. which is the standard multi-volume references set for biochemical methodology in research.

Recognized as an oil field in the 19th century, but known by Native Americans for thousands of years due to its tar seeps, the field is ranked 19th in California by total ultimate oil recovery, and has had a cumulative production of over of oil. The principal operators of the field as of 2008 were Chevron Corp. and Aera Energy LLC, but many independent oil exploration and production companies were also active on the field. The California Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) estimates approximately 20 million recoverable barrels of oil remain in the ground.California Department of Conservation, Oil and Gas Statistics, Annual Report, December 31, 2006, p. 67 Setting Oil wells and piping on the McKittrick Field, about a mile west of the town of McKittrick. The oil field is in the McKittrick Valley and the adjacent foothills of the Temblor Range at the western edge of the San Joaquin Valley. California State Route 33 and 58 intersect at the town of McKittrick, and both routes cross over portions of the field. The climate is hot and arid to semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall of , and summertime highs commonly exceeding . Some subfreezing temperatures occur in the winter, with the mean freeze-free period being from 250 to 275 days. Drainage is to the northeast, away from the Temblors towards the Central Valley, and streams are dry for most of the year. The predominant vegetation in the vicinity of the field is low scrub, in particular the saltbush Atriplex lentiformis. Elevations on the field range from approximately . Many other productive oil fields are nearby. Adjacent to the north is the enormous, and densely developed Cymric Oil Field, and beyond that the South Belridge Oil Field; to the east is the Elk Hills Oil Field, famous in the Teapot Dome Scandal of the Warren G. Harding administration; adjacent to the southwest is the Belgian Anticline Oil Field, along Route 58; and to the southeast is the huge Midway-Sunset Oil Field, the third largest oil field in the United States. The total productive area of the field is . The field is about long on the southeast to northwest axis, and about across. Geology and paleontology McKittrick Oil Field Geologic Cross Section The predominant geologic feature, and the one that makes the McKittrick field distinctive, is the presence of a huge block of Monterey shale ‚Äì more than long, approximately wide, and up to thick ‚Äì which slipped off of the slopes of the adjacent Temblor Range during the Pleistocene and moved eastward onto the plain, almost entirely covering the field, and forming an impermeable cap over the oil- bearing rock. This mass of stone, consisting of over of rock, moved from its source region, and down about in elevation. While it probably did not move into its present position all at once, the incident must have been dramatic.J.A. Taff: \\"Geology of the McKittrick Oil Field and Vicinity, Kern County, California.\\" American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 1933 available hereThickness of the unit is estimated from the cross sections shown in DOGGR, p. 268 Another unusual feature of the McKittrick field is its large tar seeps, points on the surface where petroleum has migrated upwards, forming pools. In California, the McKittrick Tar Pits are second only to the La Brea Tar Pits in fame, and have yielded dozens of skeletons of extinct megafauna with ages from about 10,000 to 40,000 years. The tar seeps outcrop in an area about long, adjacent to the McKittrick Thrust Fault, which defines the southwestern boundary of the oil field. They are found in areas where the overlying Monterey formation, which tumbled down the Temblors during the Pleistocene, eroded away, exposing the oil-bearing strata. When oil reaches the surface, it is exposed to biodegradation, evaporation, and oxidation, forming asphaltum. This series of tar seeps is the most extensive in the state, although none of the individual seeps are as large as the La Brea Tar Pits.Vista Museum of Natural History: page on the McKittrick Tar SeepsGeology of the McKittrick Tar Pits, at San Joaquin Valley Geologic Society Oil in the McKittrick field is in 13 separate pools: eight in the Northeast Area, and five in the Main Area. The most productive pools have been the Tulare-San Joaquin, Olig, and Basal Reef Ridge in the Main Area, and the Tulare-San Joaquin, Phacoides, and Oceanic in the Northeast Area. Oil API gravity varies between the different pools, with some bearing heavy crude of API gravity 12, and others with lighter oil, such as the Phacoides which reported an average value of 33. Enhanced recovery techniques such as fire flooding and steam flooding have been used since the 1960s to improve recovery of the heavier oils, while water flooding was used in the 1970s and early 1980s in the Phacoides to improve recovery (with limited success, as that pool peaked in 1966).DOGGR, p. 269‚Äì272 Major paleontological study of the remains in the tar pits began in 1921 with the first large road cut through the area. Skeletons of many now-extinct mammals have been recovered, including camels, mammoths, dire wolves, saber toothed cats, deer, and bison. Bird species found include ducks, storks, herons, and various shorebirds ‚Äì mainly species adapted to forage in shallow water.Buena Vista Museum History, production, and operations The McKittrick Tar Pits have been known to the local Native American population, the Yokuts, from prehistoric times. They used the asphaltum as a sealant, for waterproofing, for decoration, for adhesive, and for trade. In the 1860s, San Joaquin Valley settlers made the first attempts to mine the asphaltum, digging pits, trenches, and tunnels. They refined the viscous substance onsite, making it into lubricating oil and kerosene. These early attempts were only marginally profitable, but this changed in 1896 when the first real oil well was drilled. The Klondike Oil Company's Shamrock gusher, which spewed of oil per day, was not only the first gusher in the region, but the first significant oil well in the San Joaquin Valley, which went on to become one of the richest petroleum regions in the nation.Regional history, at San Joaquin Valley Geologic Society Many of the deeper pools were found in the 1960s, and some of them proved not only to have higher quality oil, but were more productive. In the Northeast Area, the Phacoides, Oceanic, and Point of Rocks pools vary from below ground surface; the temperature of the oil varies from at that depth, and the initial reservoir pressures were also high, up to , pressures that would have caused major blowouts and gushers during the early part of the century, but can be better managed with modern technology.DOGGR, p. 272 As of 2008, there were 1,135 producing oil wells on the field. Producers besides Chevron Corp., the largest, included Aera Energy LLC, Berry Petroleum, Vintage, E & B Natural Resources Management Corp., Plains Exploration & Production, Longbow LLC, and others.DOGGR database query interface References * California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III.

In addition to The Residents, frequent collaborators Nolan Cook, Carla Fabrizio and Joshua Raoul Brody also appear on the album. A tour started in October, and a narrative Internet series also appeared on YouTube. The series concerns a character known as the Bunny Boy or Bunny, who makes videos in his secret room and puts them on YouTube. In the videos he asks viewers to help him find his brother Harvey, who went missing on the island of Patmos in Greece. Bunny encourages fans to email him. The Residents' official website later announced that Bunny wished his videos to be removed. Later, they uploaded the first season again via SeeOfSound, so that the advertising money would go towards Bunny's bus ticket to Arkansas. A second season began on 16 February. The series ran for a total of 66 episodes, which were later released on a DVD entitled Is Anybody Out There?. A comic book The Bunny Boy Comic, illustrated by Adam Weller with a script by The Residents and Bunny, saw a limited release of 199 copies on RalphAmerica in June 2010 and was also sold at the European leg of the Talking Light tour.

Garbett had felt that Chase, with his Cambridge academic background, was unsuited to a large, urban see. In 1941, Chase had been a leading candidate for the vacancy at Ely, of special interest to him for his father had held that post a generation earlier. The vacancy, however, went to Edward Wynn, another Cambridge don. When further vacancies arose, Chase received favourable consideration, but it was not until Ripon appeared in 1946 that an offer was made to him. By then, Garbett was Archbishop of York, and Ripon was in the province of York, and Clement Attlee had succeeded Winston Churchill as Prime Minister.

It is in the southeast corner of the town, along the Bethlehem town-line, eight miles south of Albany. The Feura Bush ZIP Code (12067) includes parts of the town of Bethlehem. It is in the Onesquethaw Volunteer Fire Company fire protection district.  History  Feura Bush was originally called Moaksville for an early family in the vicinity, and later called Jerusalem after the Jerusalem Reformed Church. Harmon Van Der Zee was a major landowner in the area during the mid-18th century. At that time Jerusalem was a part of the town of Bethlehem, in 1832 New Scotland was erected as a separate town. In the 1920s part of the Van Der Zee homestead over the town-line in Bethlehem was taken for the West Shore Railroad's Selkirk rail yard. The yard was originally referred to as being in Feura Bush, being closer to this hamlet than to Selkirk, however it is today in the Selkirk ZIP Code. In 1854 a plank road was established to run through Feura Bush to Houcks Corners, this section is today New York State Route 32; and then from the corners to Bethlehem Center, which today is New York State Route 910A. This road was also made an official post road by the US Congress. In 1790 the Jerusalem Dutch Reformed Church was established halfway between Union (Unionville) and Jerusalem (Feura Bush). This was the first church in the area immediately south of Albany. In 1825 the church was moved to Jerusalem. The Feura Bush School (Bethlehem School District Number 5) was a one-room school house built in 1885. In 1929 the school was abandoned, and was put to different uses over time until 1987 when the Feura Bush Neighborhood Association converted it to a library. In 1929 a large brick school for kindergarten through eighth grade was built replacing the one-room school house. This building would be in service until around 1950. The West Shore Railroad established a station here around 1870 and it was used to ferry students to Ravena for high school. Around 1940 the station was discontinued. The Jerusalem (later Feura Bush) post office was once located in the Mathias Store until it moved to the hamlet's hotel in 1946 when the store was sold and converted into a residence. A new post office was built in 1989. Geography Feura Bush is situated along Main Street (New York Route 32) at the town border with neighboring Bethlehem. =Location= Architecture The hamlet has mostly Victorian and Colonial residences with some modern styles as well. Several are historic buildings from the mid-18th century. Education South Bethlehem is a part of the Ravena-Coeymans- Selkirk Central School District (R-C-S) and the children attend A.W. Becker Elementary School for kindergarten through fifth grade; and R-C-S Middle and R-C-S High for sixth through twelfth. The hamlet has a library, situated in the former one room school house.

The warnings are primarily issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), with guidance on how to react to them. Introduction The JMA has two EEW systems: one for the general public and another for the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services. When a P-wave is detected from two (or more) of the 4,235 seismometers installed throughout Japan, the JMA analyzes and predicts the approximate location of the earthquake's epicenter. This allows the JMA to notify people in affected prefectures by TV and radio if a strong earthquake is expected. An Earthquake Early Warning is issued to warn the general public when an earthquake of 5 or higher on the Japan seismic scale is expected. An EEW forecast (Á∑äÊÄ•Âú∞ÈúáÈÄüÂ†±(‰∫àÂ†±)) is issued to the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services when an earthquake of 3 or higher on the Japan seismic scale (or 3.5 or higher on the Richter magnitude scale) is expected, or when the amplitude of P- or S-waves measures more than 100 gals. The system was developed to minimize earthquake damage and enable people to take shelter or evacuate dangerous areas before the arrival of its strong surface waves. It is used by railways to slow trains and by factories to halt assembly lines before the earthquake hits. The effectiveness of the warning depends on the position of the receiver. After receiving a warning, a person has from a few seconds to a minute or more to take action. Areas near an epicenter may experience strong tremors before a warning is issued. After the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, the EEW system and Japan's tsunami warning system were considered effective. Although the tsunami killed over 10,000 people, it is believed that the casualties would have been much higher without the EEW system. In April 2011, the Chilean Subsecretary of Telecommunications said that their country hoped to establish a similar early-warning system. Hit rate The JMA announced the Earthquake Early Warning hit (accuracy) rate for the 2011 fiscal year on 31 May 2012. The hit rate is the percentage of warnings issued immediately on the detection of P-waves with a number (0 to 7) within one shindo number of the measured earthquake. For the fiscal years 2007‚Äì2009, the hit rate was 75 percent or higher (75 percent in 2007, 82 percent in 2008 and 76 percent in 2009). The 2010 hit rate fell to 28 percent, due to the number of aftershocks following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake (which occurred near the end of the 2010 fiscal year); before the earthquake, the hit rate was 72 percent. Measurement techniques have since been refined to ignore minor earthquakes, and the hit rate for FY2011 increased to 56 percent. The JMA intended to increase the hit rate to over 85 percent by FY2015. =Inaccuracies= Although EEW accuracy has been increasing, the following erroneous alarms have been issued: *11 March 2011 ‚Äì The earthquake warning for the Tohoku region underestimated the quake's intensity. *8 August 2013 ‚Äì Although an emergency earthquake bulletin was announced at 16:56 JST from Kanto to Kyushu, no shaking was observed. Noise from the ocean-floor seismograph off southeastern Mie Prefecture was recorded at the same time as shaking from a magnitude 2.3 earthquake in northern Wakayama Prefecture. *4 2016 Earthquake and Tsumami Warning *5 January 2018 ‚Äì An 11:02 JST earthquake warning for the Kant≈ç region and Fukushima Prefecture was an overestimation, caused by assessing concurrent earthquakes in Toyama Prefecture (magnitude 3.9) and Ibaraki Prefecture (magnitude 4.4) as a single quake. =Improvements= Technical improvements are being made to increase the hit rate, including the Integrated Particle Filter (IPF) and Propagation of Local Undamped Motion (PLUM) methods. The IPF method, introduced on 14 December 2016, obtains seismic source elements with a particle filter. The PLUM method, introduced on 22 March 2018, predicts the seismic intensity directly from observed intensity without estimating the hypocenter and scale. Accurate seismic-intensity forecasts can be made for large earthquakes or those whose hypocenter is unknown. Broadcast format =Television= On NHK television channels and other Japanese TV broadcasters (ISDB, including 1seg),8 Japanese Channels broadcasting the EEW simultaneously. an alert is a message window on the screen with the earthquake epicenter and areas affected by strong tremors. Two sets of chimes sound, followed by a voice announcement in Japanese: In addition to NHK, the announcement is used by Fuji TV, TV Asahi and Tokyo MX. Nippon TV and TBS shorten it to \\"Kinky≈´ Jishin Sokuh≈ç desu\\" (\\"This is an Earthquake Early Warning\\"). TV Tokyo sounds a set of chimes, without a voice announcement. The alerts also inform viewers of possible landslides or a tsunami caused by the quake in the affected area. If tsunami warnings are issued, the system utilizes 1seg to automatically turn on (and tune to NHK) all radios and televisions with 1seg technology in at-risk areas. In addition to Japanese, the warnings are broadcast in English, Mandarin, Korean and Portuguese.Tsunami Warning in multiple languages. =Mobile-phone networks= Japan's three major mobile phone carriers‚ÄîNTT docomo, au (KDDI and Okinawa Cellular) and SoftBank Mobile‚Äîhave developed Cell Broadcast systems to send multiple users an SMS of the EEW. It is mandatory for 3G cell phones sold after 2007 to receive this service, although foreign manufacturers such as Nokia, Apple, HTC, LG and Samsung are exempt. In August 2011, Apple announced that its iOS 5 iPhone platform would support EEW notification. NTT docomo EEW is enabled by default on all models of the released after 26 November 2007, and on some FOMA high-speed models in the released after February 2008.CEATEC „Éâ„Ç≥„É¢„ÅÆ905i„ÄÅÁ∑äÊÄ•Âú∞ÈúáÈÄüÂ†±„ÇíÁÑ°ÂÑü„ÅßÂèó‰ø°ÂèØËÉΩ„Å´ÔºàNikkei ITPro 2 October 2007Ôºâ au The system was enabled on all models in early 2008, including W61CA, W61H, W61K, W61SA, W61SH, W62SA and a few smartphone models, such as IS02 (TSI01). KDDI and Okinawa Cellular began free EEW broadcasts via au's SMS, , on 25 March 2008. SoftBank Mobile On 30 May 2007, SoftBank announced development of an EEW broadcast system similar to NTT docomo's and au's. Deployment of the system was originally planned for FY2008, but was postponed for two years. On 25 August 2010, EEW service began on Shikoku, in the Kansai, T≈çkai, T≈çhoku (seven prefectures) and Ch≈´goku regions, and portions of the Kant≈ç region. The EEW broadcast network has covered the whole country since 7 December 2010. The SoftBank 831N was the only model supporting EEW in March 2011, although more models had been expected to support the system after summer 2010. Other RC Solution Company developed Yurekuru Call for iPhone, a free iPhone application to receive EEW which is distributed on the Apple App Store; the application is also available for Android. Notification of an EEW might be delayed or blocked if communication lines are congested. The Japanese version of iOS 5 for iPhone has built-in EEW functionality. =Radio= Iris Ohyama EQA-001 FM EEW radio, front (upper) and rear views A specific, common chime tone from FM stations is automatically detected and turns on the radio (if in sleep mode), sounding a loud chime and broadcasting an EEW message before the quake begins by detecting S-waves.

Commissioned by the court of the Ming dynasty, in accordance to political tradition, the text was composed in 1370 by the official Bureau of History of the Ming dynasty, under direction of Song Lian (1310‚Äì1381). The compilation formalized the official history of the preceding Yuan dynasty. Under the guidance of Song Lian, the official dynastic history broke with the old Confucian historiographical tradition, establishing a new historical framework asserting that the influence of history was equal in influence to the great Confucian classics in determining the course of human affairs.  Layout and contents  The historical work consists of 210 chapters chronicling the history of the Genghisid Yuan dynasty from the time of Genghis Khan (c.1162‚Äì1227) to the flight of the last Yuan emperor, Toghon Tem√ºr (\\"Emperor Huizong\\", 1333‚Äì1370), from Khanbaliq in 1368. The chapters are, in turn, subdivided into the following: * 47 Imperial biographies (), detailing the lives of the Yuan emperors - including the pre-Yuan Mongol khans Genghis, √ñgedei, G√ºy√ºk and M√∂ngke * 58 Treatises (), detailing socio-economic history, laws and rituals * 8 Chronological tables () * 97 Biographies (), detailing important non-imperial people of the era The Treatises include the Geography () section, which spans volumes 58‚Äì63. This describes the regional Administrative divisions of the Yuan dynasty, organized by province (). The Selection of Officials () section spans volumes 81‚Äì84, describing the education and examination system. Volume 81 contains an imperial edit issued in 1291 regulating the establishment of schools and academies. Lao provides a description of some of the key terminology used in this section of the History of Yuan and how it relates the issues of the time. The section Official Posts (), which spans volumes 85‚Äì92, describes the agencies and positions within them that made up the Yuan imperial government. Farquhar explains the important terminology and organization of this section. Notable biographies include Subutai (volume 121), Baurchuk Art Tekin (volume 122), Ajall Shams al- Din Omar (volume 125), Antong (volume 126), Bayan of the Baarin (volume 127), Aju (volume 128), El Tem√ºr (volume 138), Toqto'a (volume 138), Chaghan Temur (volume 141), Yel√º Chucai (volume 146), Hong Bok-won (volume 154), Shi Tianze (volume 155), Zhang Hongfan (volume 156), Liu Bingzhong (volume 157), Xu Heng (volume 158), Li Ye (volume 160), Guo Shoujing (volume 164), Wu Cheng (volume 171), Zhao Mengfu (volume 172), Compilation The History of Yuan was first commissioned by the Hongwu Emperor in the second year of his reign (1369), using materials such as the court historical records of the Yuan dynasty, which were stored in Khanbaliq and captured by Xu Da. A team of 16, led by Song Lian and chancellor Li Shanchang overseeing scholars Wang Yi () (1321-1372), Zhao Xun () and others, compiled the first draft of the history within months. Due to the paucity of court records for the last years of the Yuan, however, compilation had to be paused while more historical material was sourced. In 1370, after a second commission, the History of Yuan was completed with new materials. Altogether, the 210-chapter history took a mere 331 days to compile. The History of Yuan is unique among the official histories in that no commentary or evaluation of any biographical subjects was given by the compilers.  Sources  Wilkinson states that the main source of the History of Yuan was the main Veritable Records () compiled over the period 1206-1369 during the 13 reigns from Taizu to Ningzong, which needed translation into Chinese. Farquhar mentions that the section of the Treatises on Official Posts was largely based on the Jingshi Dadian (), now lost. Criticism The History of Yuan was criticised by imperial Chinese scholars for its lack of quality and numerous errors, attributed to the haste with which it was compiled. The Qing-era historian and linguist Qian Daxin commented that of the official histories, none was more quickly completed‚Äîor worse in quality‚Äîthan that of the Yuan dynasty. Wang Huizu, another Qing-era scholar, compiled a work on the history pointing out more than 3,700 factual and textual errors in the text, including duplicated biographies for important figures such as Subutai, as well as inconsistent transliterations of the same name - Phagspa, for example, was transliterated in three different ways. The Qing dynasty Qianlong Emperor used the Mongolian language to \\"correct\\" inconsistent and erroneous Chinese character transcriptions of Mongol names in the History of Yuan in his \\"Imperial compilation of the Three Histories of Liao, Jin,& Yuan explained in the National Language\\" () project. Qianlong's \\"corrections\\" ended up compounding the errors and making the transcription of some foreign words in the History of Yuan even worse. Marshall Broomhall wrote that \\"So unscientific was this work that the K'ien-lung editions of the Liao, Kin, and Y√ºan histories are practically useless.\\" Both the old and new transliterations were shown in the Qianlong edition. The Manchu word for village, farkha, replaced Ha-li-fa, a transliteration of Calif. Bie-shi-ba-li, a transliteration of the Turkish term for the city Bishbalik, was turned into Ba-shi-bo-li, with the explanation that \\"bashi\\" and \\"boli\\" were translations of \\"head\\" and \\"kidneys\\" in Arabic. Gi-lu-rh was created to sound more aesthetic than the transliteration K'ie-lu-lien, the name of the Mongolian river Kerulun.  New History  Given the many errors in the text, efforts were made during the Qing and subsequent decades to re-compile the history of the Yuan. Qian Daxin completed some treatises and tables, but the most determined effort was by Ke Shaomin, a late Qing historian who re-compiled a 257-chapter text over thirty years, completing it in 1920. This, the New History of Yuan, was given official historical status by the Republic of China in 1921, and included as one of the Twenty-five histories.  Translation  The History of Yuan was translated into Manchu as (Wylie: Yuwan gurun i suduri, M√∂llendorff: Yuwan gurun i suduri). Mongolian scholar Dandaa translated the whole history into Classic Mongolian in the early 20th century. The effort was funded by the government of Mongolian People's Republic and it is now kept in the National Archive of Mongolia. Schurmann contains an annotated translation of volumes 93 and 94. Xiao includes a translation of volumes 98 and 99.

These islands are home to northern fur seal herds which were actively hunted by indigenous populations and later by many nationalities. These islands of the Pribilofs are also the southern end of the range of the polar bear, (Ursus maritimus) The North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 signed by the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia and the United States limited hunting of the seals on these islands; this international treaty was one of the first conservation treaties, and set the stage for subsequent treaties. History The Pribilof Islands were discovered by Russian fur hunters in 1786, and in the following years a number of small villages for hunting and processing seals were established, including ones at the sites of the present-day St. George and St. Paul. After the Russian American Company was granted an exclusive monopoly on fur in the area, these villages were largely consolidated. The Company continued to exploit the seal population until the area was sold to the United States in 1867. The area was then administered by the United States government, with leases authorizing private companies to exploit the herd. By the early 20th century, the seal population had fallen dramatically, from an estimated millions to under 300,000. Due to the lucrative nature of the industry, the Kingdoms of Russia, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States agreed to a moratorium on seal fishing in the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911. The seal population had significantly recovered by the 1920s, and was around 1.5 million in 1952. The Convention expired in 1985, bringing an effective end to the seal hunting industry. The area is now part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, and the herd is generally subject only to subsistence hunting by the native Aleut population. Although no longer commercially hunted, the seal population has been decreasing recently, possibly due to huge amounts of debris that has washed up on the islands.AP Story: Seals' island is dumping ground for marine debris Landmark areas Three areas of Saint Paul and Saint George were designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1962, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. On Saint George, the district includes a strip of land on the north shore, encompassing historic elements of the city of St. George, and extending east to a rookery and historic kill site area. On Saint Paul, the historic portion of the main city are included in the district, as is most of the northeastern triangular peninsula ending at North Point, where major rookeries are located. About 10% of the land area of Saint Paul Island is included in the district. In both cities, historic structures include industrial processing facilities as well as worker housing. The Russian Orthodox churches in the two communities, Sts. Peter and Paul Church in St. Paul and St. George the Great Martyr Orthodox Church in St. George, also contribute to the area's historic significance and are separately listed on the National Register. The rookery area on St. George includes the remains of one of the early Russian-built villages, Staraya Atil. On Saint Paul the district includes nine separate rookery areas and five historic village sites.

Politics In 1901 he was elected a member of the first Senate of Australia from Western Australia as a Free Trader sitting until the expiration the three-year term to which he had been elected. Harney stood as the Liberal Party candidate at the 1922 general election in South Shields. The sitting MP was Havelock Wilson who had had a chequered political career having been elected as an Independent Labour candidate and then aligning himself with the Lib-Labs before becoming a founder member of the National Democratic Party and later getting back into Parliament in 1918 as a Coalition Liberal ‚Äì that is a supporter of the Liberal-Conservative coalition government led by David Lloyd George. In a three cornered contest with Havelock Wilson standing as a National Liberal and a Labour candidate, Harney scraped home by just 25 votes over Labour with Havelock Wilson bottom of the poll. In the general election of 1923 and again in 1924, Harney held his seat, this time in straight fights with Labour but with majorities of 7,195 and 6,319. Harney died just before the 1929 general election so no by-election was needed but this time Labour candidate James Chuter Ede gained the seat.The Times, 18.5.29 References  External links  * Category:1865 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Western Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:People educated at Castleknock College Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Free Trade Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1922‚Äì1923 Category:UK MPs 1923‚Äì1924 Category:UK MPs 1924‚Äì1929 Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Irish emigrants to Australia (before 1923) ","title":"Edward Harney"},{"id":"18197851","text":"Peter Lewis is a former British television continuity announcer. He was the first person to broadcast from London Weekend Television's new centre on the south bank of the River Thames, when it opened in 1971.

Design and development It was developed for use by engineer troops after the Siege of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05 illustrated the usefulness of this class of weapon in destroying bunkers and fortifications immune to normal artillery. The 25 cm schwerer Minenwerfer was a muzzle-loading, rifled mortar that had a hydro-spring type recoil system. It fired either a shell or a shell; both contained far more explosive filler than ordinary artillery ammunition of the same caliber. The low muzzle velocity allowed for thinner shell walls, hence more space for filler for the same weight shell. The low velocity also allowed the use of explosives like ammonium nitrate‚Äìcarbon that were less shock- resistant than TNT, which was in short supply. Shells filled with these substitutes nonetheless were the cause of many premature detonations, making the riskier for the gun crew than normal artillery pieces. Service The wheels were removed and the sMW was then placed in a pit or trench at least deep, protecting the mortar and its crew. Despite the extremely short range, the sMW proved to be potent as its massive shells were almost as effective in penetrating fortifications as the largest siege guns in the German inventory, including the Dicke Bertha (Big Bertha), a howitzer that was more than 50 times the weight of the sMW. The value of the sMW is indicated by the number in service, which increased from 44 when the war broke out, to 1,234 at its end. In 1916, a new longer barrelled version was put into production. This new model, which had a longer range, was named the 25 cm (new pattern), which was abbreviated to 25 cm sMW n/A. The older, short-barrel model was then renamed 25 cm sMW a/A () (old pattern).

The son of Florentine sculptor Pasquale Romanelli, Raffaello is fore-mostly known for his monuments and portrait busts dedicated to noteworthy figures. He worked around the globe in America, Argentina, Austria, Cuba, England, France, Germany, Italy, Romania and Russia. Raffaello worked from two studios both located in the ‚ÄòOltrarno‚Äô district in Florence, initially from the family studio in Borgo San Frediano and then from a new one in Piazza Santo Spirito. Both studios were former churches: after being deconsecrated, they were converted into sculpture studios to make use of the ample space provided by the high ceilings. The atelier in Borgo San Frediano still houses the Romanelli Sculpture Studio and Gallery, an active studio with Raffaello's portraiture legacy being continued by his great-great-grandchildren. Personal life =Childhood= Born in Florence on May 13, 1856 to Pasquale Romanelli and his wife Elisa a descendant of Francesco Ferruccio, daughter of Vincenzo Mangoni, he was the fourth born of six children. From an early age Raffaello could be found in his father's studio, where he acquired the first skills of draughtsmanship. His first official work was the hand of Lorenzo Bartolini in marble, gifted to the Russian Princess Olga Orloff, a family friend of his parents. =Schooling= It was Italian custom from mid- July to September to go to the hills or to the sea to avoid the summer heat in the cities. Raffaello's family spent their summers at Viareggio and here as a young boy Raffaello developed a longing to spend his life in the Navy. As an official Naval school did not yet exist, Pasquale paid a large sum to the captain of a frigate to have his son taken on board and to take care of him while sailing. Raffaello was fourteen at that time. After a few months Raffaello returned having matured and now made-up his mind to enrol himself at the Florence Academy. There he studied under Professor Augusto Rivalta and Emilio Zocchi. Whilst at the Academy, he also continued to learn the skills of working marble in his father's studio. He had a rebellious spirit which at times made his professor's task rather difficult but concurrently he was extremely gifted and creative which earned him the silver medal for best in class along with the prize money which accompanied the award. His contemporaries at the school included Vittorio Matteo Corcos, later renowned portraitist, who was participating in painting classes, and sculptor Gaetano Trentanove, attending sculpture classes. =Coming into his prime= In 1876 Raffaello, by then aged twenty, won the Annual Prize for Sculpture from the Academy, with the bas-relief of Jacob and Rachel at the Well. He finished his schooling in 1880, aged twenty four and in the same year won a national competition for his work L‚ÄôIndemoniato che si Getta ai Piedi di Cristo ‚Äì The Possessed Man Throwing Himself at Christ's Feet. In that same year he produced another work, the statue of the Roman hero, Caio Muzio Sc√¶vola; (524AC-480AC circa) which attracted much attention to the young sculptor. With this piece he won a scholarship to study for a year at the Rome Academy of Arts. The piece was later exhibited in the National Gallery of Fine arts in Florence. During this time he met Sofia Benini and they married in August 1881 at Florence's Palazzo Vecchio. He was 25 and she was 22. In 1882, their first son was born, Romano Romanelli, who also grew up to become a famous sculptor. Career =Studio Borgo San Frediano= Soon he was given a room in his father Pasquale's studio and started working on commissions that his father passed on to him. One in particular which characterised these initial years was the portrait busts of Paolo Demidoff, his consort Princess Elena, and three of their children, Elim, Aurora and Anatoly. Later in 1885 he would be commissioned by Princess Elena to create a memorial monument upon the death of Prince Paolo for the church of Saint Nicholas in Taghil in the Urals, where the gravestones of his ancestors were to be found. During these early days at the studio, Raffaello also became familiar with many of the locals of the San Frediano borough area, receiving commissions to make portrait busts. And so he began to build a reputation in the area, revealing his great character and spirit and above all his exceptional talent as a portraitist. In 1884 he modelled the face of a San Frediano boy, Me ne Impipo, which is preserved in terracotta in the Galleria Romanelli. =Recognition in Florence= At the age of twenty-seven, Raffaello had the honour to be commissioned for two works for the facade of the Florence Cathedral (the Duomo). The figures were of Pope Leo the Great and Pierluigi of Palestrina. In December 1886 Raffaello was nominated by the Florence Academy of Fine Arts an Honorary Academic. After the death of his father in 1887, Raffaello took over direction of the studio in Borgo San Frediano, whilst his brother continued the administration of the art gallery on Lungarno Acciaiuoli. He made a portrait bust, which can be found in the cemetery of Porte Sante, to commemorate his father. The bust sits on a granite column at the bottom of which leans an angel. In the studio of San Frediano, Raffaello received the illustrious personalities, nobility and gentry of the day seeking to have their portraits made in marble and in bronze. Soon his fame even surpassed that of his father, both in Italy and internationally. In December 1888, the Florence Academy of Fine Arts elevated him to Accademico Corrispondente. Then in 1892 he was made a Professor of the Academy. =The Era of National Works ‚Äì statesmen, political figures= From 1890 Raffaello began to work on very important commissions both nationally and internationally. Raffaello's popularity was growing at such a significant pace that from 1894 he had to rent a second studio in Santo Spirito to make space for production. Winning the competition to make a monument dedicated to Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian General and politician who played a large role in the unification of Italy, for Siena had made this need greater. This was one of many national commissions completed by Raffaello, it was acquired by the city council of Siena to honour Garibaldi. Raffaello's sketch submitted in 1890 for the project was met with unanimous appraisal from the committee members for the simplicity of the pose and its modern outlook. The principal contestants Romanelli was up against were Zocchi, Calzolari, Frenguelli and Pozzi. After three meetings the committee finally settled on Raffaello. The piece was completed by 1896 and in the same year Raffaello set to work on a monument dedicated to Donatello for the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence. Donatello was the most important early Renaissance sculptor, goldsmith and designer. During Raffaello's lifetime he had made many commemorative monuments to important figures, this one was a particular honour for Raffaello. Raffaello's next pieces of work to emerge around this time were centred around Ubaldino Peruzzi, Mayor of Florence and one of Italy's first ministers, a reputed political figure Raffaello had known well. Raffaello portrays him in four bas- reliefs which document notable moments in his political life. One of which was the inauguration of the positioning of Michelangelo‚Äôs the statue David in Piazzale Michelangelo in 1875. The piece shows important figures of Florentine society gathered to honour the great renaissance artist, among them Peruzzi. Following a similar theme, in 1899 Raffaello completed the bronze of the Marquess Cosimo Ridolfi, which stands in Piazza Santo Spirito in Florence. The Marquess was an agronomist and politician, deemed one of the most learned Tuscan men of his era, heralded as the man responsible for spreading modern agriculture in Italy. In 1829 he had founded the Municipal Savings Bank of Florence and was president of the historic Accademia dei Georgofili for 23 years. He was an ambassador in both London and Paris. Raffaello portrays him standing with a book in his hands. The unveiling of the statue took place in 1898, 50 years since the proclamation of King Carlo Alberto‚Äôs constitution and the 32nd anniversary of the Marquess Ridolfi's death. In 1900, on March 14, in via del Quirinale, Rome, the bronze equestrian statue dedicated to King Carlo Alberto of Piedmont-Sardinia was unveiled in the presence of King Umberto I and Queen Margherita. The horse is represented as brought to a standstill and pawing the ground impatiently, while the King is pensive in his General's uniform siting elegantly on its back. The pedestal is adorned with two bas- reliefs, one representing the Victory at Goito and the other the Abdication at Novara. The monument was intended to mark the centennial anniversary of his birth. Another important Florentine figure immortalised by Raffaello's hands was Florentine Benvenuto Cellini, whose bronze bust stands in the middle of the Eastern side of Florence's Ponte Vecchio. It was commissioned in 1900 by the famous goldsmiths of the bridge to mark the fourth century since his birth and honour him as one of the great artists of their trade. Cellini was a great master goldsmith and a reputed sculptor of the 1500s. Raffaello's greatest commission in Italy came in 1914 from the Roman Curia requesting a portrait of Pope Benedict XV to adorn the head of diocese. The Pope had never before accepted to pose for a portrait and exceptionally posed for Raffaello on three separate days, an unheard event at the time. Raffaello intellect and erudite conversation encouraged the Pope to be at ease, talking, moving enabling Raffaello to discern his personality. War in Europe had just started, and whilst Italy was not yet involved, the Pope was clearly anxious, trying to advocate peace. The results of the artist's time with the Pope were two statues, one of the Pope sitting and one of him standing. In 1923 Raffaello unveiled another equestrian statue, this time dedicated to Francesco Ferrucci, a famous Florentine Military Commissioner of the Medici family much celebrated as a brave Florentine war hero and ancestor to Raffaello's wife. Raffaello made several war memorials, in 1892 to remember the Fallen Students of the Battle of Curtatone at Montanara, Siena. Another example is the plaque he sculpted for the Fallen at the Battle of Piombino. Following on this theme are the many funeral monuments he made for cemeteries such as the ones to his father Pasquale, Prince Paolo Demidoff, Gaetano Leopardi, the Wernke Monument to name but a few. He was also commissioned to make a plaque honouring the famous Italian poet Giosu√® Carducci. =Russia and Romania= In 1913 Raffaello won a competition out of 142 competitors to make the monument dedicated to Tsar Alexander II, Russia's Emperor, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland. This is one of the largest monuments in Europe. Raffaello already had links with Russia and had visited St Petersburg in 1901 to admire the artwork at the Hermitage Museum, notably that of Antonio Canova and Lorenzo Bartolini. Around this time he was commissioned to create the portrait busts of two opera singers of the Imperial court, the tenor Nicolaj Nicolaevic Figner and his Florentine born wife the soprano Medea Mei Figner. He returned again in 1912, taking part in a competition to create the prestigious monument dedicated to Tsar Alexander II. The cousin of the Tsar and the president of the commission for the monument came to Florence in 1914 to establish the terms of contract and to name Raffaello as the victor. He also worked profusely for the royal court and government officials in Romania. This initiated with a request from Bucharest in 1900 from the Conservative Party who wanted to erect a monument in memory of Barbu Catargiu in Mitropliei Place where he had been assassinated. A loyal follower of Prince Cuza, Catargiu had been the first prime minister of the national government in 1866. Raffaello portrayed him sitting in an armchair with the figure of a woman by his side. Following this commission more work from Romania came Raffaello's way. He built a close friendship with King Carol I (born Prince Karl of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen) and his wife Queen Elizabeth of Wied (widely known by her literary name: Carmen Sylva). He produced a marble bust of King Carol I dressed in military uniform wearing decorations and later in 1907 another bronze statue of King Carol l, this time on horseback, once again in military attire. In this same period he made a bas-relief for Queen Elizabeth as well as her portrait bust and that of Queen Victoria‚Äôs granddaughter Princess Maria of Edinburgh, who had become the wife of King Carol I's nephew, the future King Ferdinand I of Romania. He was also commissioned to sculpt many portrait busts: of painters, lawyers, ministers and often their wives as well. Between 1907 and 1913 Raffaello made numerous decorative pieces for gardens, such as fountains carved in marble. He also received the commission to make several memorial monuments, as the one in the city of Iasi, dedicated to the Prince of Moldavia and Valacchia Alexander Cuza, who had been the founder of the independent Romanian state. =The Americas= At the outbreak of the First World War Raffaello turned his interests to the United States. The opportunity to do so came about from the invitation to take part in the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco. This drew interest to his work. Consequently, at the end of the war Raffaello was commissioned to make a Mausoleum in memory of Verner Zevola Reed, Colorado's wealthiest businessman. An important work, which was created between 1919 and 1923 in Florence and then shipped and assembled in America. Perhaps his most challenging work. Among several portrait busts, he made a bust of William Penn in Philadelphia and in 1927 the Bust of Dante for Detroit. This commission was requested by the Italian Community in Detroit to celebrate the sixth century from Dante‚Äôs death. Raffaello worked a lot in Kansas City where there is a park named after him, the Romanelli Garden. Several Romanelli sculptures decorate the city, some original models by Raffaello; others were produced and sold by his studio from its vast collection of plaster models. His craft also took him to Cuba where Raffaello created for the Aspuro family the bronze door for a chapel entrance in memory of Christopher Columbus. Then to Puerto Rico, where Raffaello created the Tomb for the Ferrer Family, another magnificent memorial monument. =Twilight Years= Raffaello was a tireless worker, besides his monuments and portraits he created numerous small and medium-sized works of the most varied subjects, religious, allegorical, everyday imagery and animals. It is thought that his production totals more than 2,300 works. During his lifetime he exhibited in Florence, Milan, Turin, Paris, San Francisco, and St. Louis, Missouri. He worked up until his death in April 1928, passing on the studio to his son Romano Romanelli and his unfinished commissions, the biggest being the monument for Louis Botha, for South Africa. Raffaello had won the competition to execute it in 1926. Style and influences =Marble vs bronze= He grew up amongst marble sculptors, his father Pasquale and mentor Lorenzo Bartolini rarely used bronze. Marble was the preferred choice of material for the way in which it reflected light. Near the end of the 1800s creating Bronze statues for open air spaces came into fashion. Raffaello therefore had to learn the techniques required for casting sculptures in bronze. In particularly he had to learn how to work with coloured wax, because his clay sculptures were transformed at the foundry into wax models which then needed to be worked on before the fusion. Raffaello worked with both marble and bronze during his career. =Characteristics of Raffaello‚Äôs work= His traditional training had taught him to seek inspiration from classical sculpture but, similarly to his father Pasquale, the most important characteristic of Raffaello's work is its realism: he sought to portray with great accuracy his subject matter, looking to replicate natural states of being. He drew inspiration from scenes of everyday life and often picked his models from the local people residing in the studio's neighbourhood. Raffaello was primarily a renowned portraitist of great esteem; he knew how to capture the spirit of his subject, their manner, style, expression and character. He possessed the ability to expose the rawness of his subject, which had made him immediately famous from the time of his training. He preferred for his models to talk and move to enable him to create a lively similarity. During his long career, he made portraits globally of Kings and Popes, nobles and bourgeoisie. The Ambrosano family were great admirers of Raffaello's portraiture. The 1903 bronze figure of George Flood France is a good example of his portrait skills. The work was made for Oxford University and it is now exhibited in the permanent collection at the Ashmolean Museum. His 1900 bust of Princess Marina Borghese named Iris Florentina decorated with the flowers symbolising the city of Florence is one of his most celebrated pieces (National Gallery of Modern Art, Rome). The fine attention to details is a typical feature of his work: he showed the same attention to detail whether making a portrait or a decorative piece such as the various statues and fountains he made to decorate gardens for which he took inspiration from the Renaissance and the Florentine Baroque periods. During his later years, Raffaello's style reflected the climate of the Liberty style, especially with regards to the female form. =Religious symbolism= Many of Raffaello's pieces allude to religious imagery. The Nazarene in bronze, a figure of Christ to be found in Moscow, the 1899 Christ and the Blindman in the Cemetery of Bari, Bust of a woman with cupid in Bangkok commissioned by the sovereign Chulalongkorn the Great, King Rama V, the fifth monarch of Siam. As well as The Fountain of Angels in bronze, 1902, in St. Louis (MO), made for a competition. The angel has a feminine face, open arms and holds two objects from which water flows out. The judging Jury awarded him the Grand Prix, beating the likes of Lucio Fontana, Augusto Rivalta, Achille D'Orsi and Galletti. His Mausoleum in Colorado to the state's wealthiest family at the time, the Reed family, is a mix of bronze and marble. It is a highly skilled monument, with fine and ornate details and abundant with religious imagery.

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, converted into lofts in 2000, and declared a Historic-Cultural Monument in 2002. Architecture and construction James Boon Lankershim (1850-1931), a wealthy wheat farmer and miller whose father owned much of the San Fernando Valley in the late 19th century, hired architect John F. Blee to design the building. Constructed at a reported cost of $200,000, the building opened in 1907 and was considered one of the finest office buildings in the city. The lobby has a 22-foot ceiling, and the exterior is decorated with elaborate cornice work and spandrel panels with an incised diamond motif. Originally a six-story structure, two additional stories designed by Robert Brown Young & Son were added in 1911. Illegal gambling and police raids Postcard of San Fernando Building, ca. 1915 The building's history includes multiple reports of illegal gambling. The current building web site notes that the building was the site of gambling activities around 1910, resulting in several raids by the police. In each case, however, the gamblers were tipped off to the impending raids and no evidence of gambling was discovered. In 1930 police raided the San Fernando Building again, and arrested eleven men for conducting illegal lottery operations at the building; police also arrested a woman for possession of eight quarts of liquor. The Los Angeles Times described the building as \\"local headquarters for various well-known lotteries.\\" \\"Thousands in Southern California and near-by points who bought lottery tickets in the hope of acquiring lucky wealth are certain of great disappointment, police announced last night, because of a raid on offices in the San Fernando Building, described as local headquarters for various well-known lotteries.\\" Police said they found thousands of tickets for the \\"Army and Navy Veterans of Canada Sweepstakes,\\" the \\"Cuban Sweepstakes,\\" and other chance-taking ventures, including baseball pools and \\"bank-clearings guessing ventures.\\" Police also said one of the gamblers had robbed a Los Angeles bank, and had hidden the money somewhere in the building. The money has never been found. Other points of interest in building's early history In addition to its association with gambling and lotteries, the San Fernando Building was known for the many legitimate businesses operating there. Other highlights from the building's early history include: *In 1907 the Los Angeles Realty Board and the California State Realty Federation, responsible for investigating real estate fraud and other \\"queer deals,\\" moved into the building. *In 1913 physicians and surgeons formed the city's first cooperative telephone exchange at the San Fernando Building. The system was intended to provide 24-hour communication between doctors and patients, freeing doctors to attend the theater or make an out-of-town trip. *The California Film Exchange, housing film stock from Hollywood's early motion pictures, was located in Unit 110 of the building. In October 1913 a fire broke out destroying some 150 motion pictures. The fire was caused by an overheated motor, leading to two explosions when the flames reached chemicals stored at the exchange. Three individuals, including a fireman, were hospitalized; the night operator of the physicians' telephone exchange located above the film office narrowly escaped the flames. The fire led to calls to prohibit the storage of highly flammable films in downtown office buildings. *In 1917 the \\"Half Century Association\\" was founded, establishing its headquarters on the seventh floor of the San Fernando Building. The association was organized for the purpose of \\"breaking down the unjust age limit\\" set by government and private business for civil and private service and \\"to do for the man who has passed the half-century mark what the Y.M.C.A. does for the young men of the country.\\" *The U.S. Army operated its Los Angeles recruiting station at the corner of Fourth and Main in the San Fernando Building during World War I. When the United States entered the war in the spring of 1917, the Los Angeles Times reported that \\"the offices in the San Fernando Building were crowded during the day with applicants for enlistment in the National Guard and Reserve Corps.\\" The building served as the Army's recruiting center again during World War II, as the Times reported on Hollywood actors joining in \\"the long service induction line in the San Fernando Building.\\" Historic designations The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and was designated a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #728) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 2002. Conversion to loft space In the 1980s and 1990s, the area surrounding the San Fernando Building had become part of skid row. In 1998, Gilmore Associates announced plans to convert the San Fernando Building and two other early 20th-century buildings located nearby (the Hellman and Continental Buildings) into 230 lofts. Gilmore's plan to convert a block of skid row into upscale lofts was initially met with skepticism; one expert described the location as desolate, and opined that the lack of such amenities as a grocery store nearby could make the project \\"a tough sell.\\" However, the Los Angeles Times saw the project as having the potential to change the downtown area: \\"That distant sound of hammers you hear is coming from the corner of Spring and 4th, where developer Tom Gilmore has initiated an amazing project...Gilmore has assembled an entire block of buildings extending along 4th Street, from Spring to Main. It includes the 12-story Continental Building, generally regarded as the city's first skyscraper; the Farmers and Merchants Bank complex, and the San Fernando Building, built by potentate developer James B. Lankershim.\\" The San Fernando Building was the first of the three buildings to reopen in August 2000, and by March 2001, the building was 93% leased to tenants paying rents between $790 and $6,000 per month. The converted buildings consisted of large, open lofts with high ceilings and no interior walls except for the bathrooms. The conversion was designed by architect Wade Killefer, who noted, \\"What lends these buildings to residential use is lots of windows and high ceilings, offering wonderful light.\\" The combined project became known as the Old Bank District lofts. The gentrification of skid row has drawn criticism from homeless advocates. Alice Callaghan of Las Familias Del Pueblo said, \\"Skid row is the last place in the community where a person can go if they have no money and no family.\\" Callaghan criticized developers swooping in to buy the area's affordable housing stock: \\"For them to come and take irreplaceable housing stock for people who have no choice about where to live, so they can have some Disneyland Manhattan experience, is outrageous and immoral.\\" Baco Mercat, an upscale bar and restaurant, operates on the ground floor of the building in space occupied during World War I by the Army's recruiting station.

A Sierra cup (originally called a Sierra Club Cup) is a cup used for camping or Backpacking. Sierra cups are wider at the top than bottom, allowing for stacking. They typically have a fixed wire handle that is formed into a hook for attaching the cup to a belt. Some products, which use the name \\"sierra cup,\\" have straight handles or handles that can fold away or be removed to save storage space. The cup is normally made of stainless steel, although other materials such as aluminum, titanium, and plastic have also been used. While metal sierra cups may be used for cooking food or purifying water, they were not designed for this use and do it poorly. The narrow base makes a sierra cup easier to tip over. The broad rim creates more surface area for water to evaporate, thus increasing time to boil water in it. The cup generally becomes scalding hot when heating water and cannot be drunk from directly until it has cooled down. Sierra cups are typically small containers, holding about 10 oz. Sierra cups do have advantages: they are inexpensive and stack easily. Their handles and wide tops make them well suited for dispensing food out of a group pot, as well as a personal bowl/plate. Sierra cups have been in use since the early part of the 20th century, perhaps as early as 1905. A 1940 Sierra Club Bulletin article has pictures of sierra cup use in the wilderness dated as early as 1931.

Based on the cartoon series of the same title, which was loosely inspired by the Arthurian legend, the game was released in North America exclusively. The player takes on the role of a team of American football players who are transported to Medieval England and given the mission to save King Arthur and destroy the evil sorceress Morgana and her army. The game was the first Enix title developed by an American company, and was inspired in-part by The Legend of Zelda. It was received with reviews ranging from mediocre to extremely poor.  Gameplay  The characters' meters are shown at the top of the screen. Here, Arthur and the Knights are at the center and bottom of the screen The game is an action-adventure game, played from a top-down perspective. The player takes on the role of Arthur King and is accompanied by two Knights of Justice controlled by the game console. The player battles enemies using a regular sword swing or a special attack, and can block high and low attacks.. Twelve Knights are available from the start (including Arthur King), each with his own weapon, personality and statistics for life force, defense, strength and speed. Each boss of the game has a specific weakness against one of the Knights. Changing party members is done by visiting the Round Table room in Camelot.. Each character has a life meter, and Arthur also has a power meter. Various items must be collected to complete quests and objectives, while some can be used to restore a character's life meter.. An overworld map feature allows the player to directly access locations already visited once.. The game has no saving feature but allows accessing various points of the storyline with a system of passwords.. Plot The events of the game are set in a fictional version of Britain in the 5th century.. The evil sorceress Morgana has magically imprisoned King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in the Cave of Glass beneath her castle, past Hadrian's Wall. At Camelot, the King's wizard Merlin uses a crystal ball and locates a brave team of \\"warriors\\" in the future, led by Arthur King and dubbed \\"The Knights\\". They are actually American football players, though Merlin interprets their names as a sign of fate. He summons them back in time, and the Lady of the Table transforms them into \\"Knights of Justice\\". Merlin asks them to break the seal on King Arthur and the Knights of the Round by gathering the twelve Keys of Truth.. The party retrieves the Excalibur sword from the Lady of the Lake, proving their worth by claiming the Pendragon Shield from a young dragon at Shield Heights. They assist Erek, the deposed ruler of Tintagel Castle, and recover the first Key of Truth in the castle. They make their way into the village of Welton, which is under a mind control spell, and recover the second Key of Truth at Gruesome Keep. After breaking the spell on Welton and crossing the Blinder's Way, they claim the third Key of Truth at Castle Sanguine.. During the event, a Warlord infiltrates Camelot and poisons Squire Everett. The party collects an antidote in the Swamp of Zagar and saves the Squire. They then claim the fourth Key of Truth in Stone Keep. They rescue the son of the Gnome King to obtain the fifth Key of Truth, and collects four Elemental Keys to unlock access to Castle Vilor and the sixth Key of Truth. The party finds the seventh and eighth Keys of Truth in Crownhorn village and the Cape of Death, respectively. The ninth and tenth Keys are found in Blackroot Keep and the Dark Citadel while searching for the missing pieces of the Staff of Rhiothamus, which can break open a path in Hadrian's Wall. Using the Staff, the party goes past Hadrian's Wall and into the Dark Forest, where the eleventh Key of Truth is found. In a cemetery, they stumble upon a statue of Morgana, which fires a magic beam that kills the two Knights in the party. Arthur travels to the Town of the Dead by himself then to the Plain of the Dead and retrieves his two dead Knights. They reach Morgana's castle, Stone Gardens, and defeat Morgana in her dragon form, thus obtaining the last Key of Truth. In the game's ending sequence, the party members are congratulated by the real, freed King Arthur, and Merlin uses Stonehenge to send them back to their era.  Development  King Arthur & the Knights of Justice was the first Enix game developed by an American company: Manley & Associates in Issaquah, Washington. Roughly two dozen people worked on the game, though not all at the same time. It was initially planned for a 16-megabit cartridge, but four additional megabits were eventually added to expand the game. Development spanned about two years.. In addition to the original cartoon series, the developers gathered ideas from several sources for inspiration, including The Legend of Zelda action-adventure game series, and books such as T. H. White's The Book of Merlyn and fables from Medieval poet Marie de France. They noted that the hardest part of development was coming up with puzzles for each of the regions, as they had to be \\"fun and challenging, but not repetitive\\". While they tried to maintain a balance between action and puzzles, they noted that they focused more on the puzzle aspect of the game. Favorite parts of the game for the developers include the dragon battles, the boss Blackwing and Morgana's Warlords.  Reception  The title received generally negative reviews. Freelance critic Robert Schmitz gave the title a score of 0.5 out of 11, calling it \\"awful\\" and explaining the game is almost \\"better left unsaid\\", Schmitz criticised Enix's decision to base the game on a little-known cartoon series. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were divided. Ed Semrad and Danyon Carpenter said it was \\"okay\\", with the strong music, immersive sound effects, and epic quest balanced against the below-average graphics, while Al Manuel and Sushi-X said it was an all-around mediocre clone of Secret of Mana. Both Carpenter and Sushi-X remarked that the game would have a hard time getting noticed due to it being released in the same month as Chrono Trigger. Allan Milligan, in a review for the Gaming Intelligence Agency, judged the graphics and audio both mediocre, the character designs \\"terrible,\\" the plot generic and the puzzles not challenging. He noted that it is impossible for the player to know in advance which Knight is best suited for which boss. Alt URL Milligan called the game \\"staggeringly ill-conceived\\" and likened it to a \\"succession of fetch quests.\\" He criticized the fact that all enemies on a screen must be defeated to progress through some passages, and the possibility for characters and enemies to be hidden from the player's view behind large objects. The Knights' artificial intelligence was also denounced, as was the lack of animation when a character or enemy is hit.

As in the case of Kenneth Foster, Wood's death sentence stems from the Texas law of parties, which is related to the felony murder rule. Law of parties Texas has what is commonly referred to as the \\"law of parties\\" under criminal cases. The law says that if a person, \\"acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense, he solicits, encourages, directs, aids, or attempts to aid the other person to commit the offense\\", then they are criminally responsible for the conduct of another as well. Murder of Kris Keeran Shortly after 6:00 a.m. on January 2, 1996, Wood and Daniel Earl Reneau parked outside a Texaco station in Kerrville, Texas. While Wood waited outside, Reneau entered the station and pointed a .22-caliber handgun at clerk Kris Keeran. When Keeran did not respond to Reneau's requests, Reneau shot the clerk, killing him almost instantly. Hearing the gunshot, Wood entered the gas station and found the clerk on the floor behind the counter. Wood then ran to the back, where he removed the surveillance video and the murder weapon, while Reneau carried the store's safe and cash box. They both then fled from the scene. The value of cash and checks was estimated to be $11,350. According to ABC News, Wood says he was forced by Reneau at gunpoint to take the surveillance video. He then destroyed the video after showing it to his brother and telling him that he and Reneau had carried out the robbery and murder. Conviction and sentencing Wood and Reneau were both arrested on the day of the murder. Reneau was sentenced to death and was executed on June 13, 2002. Wood was convicted and sentenced to death also, although he was not in the store during the killing and though he claims he was not aware that Reneau was going to use force. Wood has been on the Texas death row since March 3, 1998. Additionally, Wood is borderline mentally disabled with an IQ of 80 and was initially judged not mentally fit to stand trial. Victim's family The victim's father, Charles Keeran, said he would like to see Wood live the rest of his life in prison instead of being executed. \\"The death penalty, to me, is the easy way out,\\" he said. \\"If you had to be down there and get up every morning, as hot and humid as it is, knowing that you are going to spend the rest of your life locked up under those conditions, that's punishment. That's what I think my son would want for him.\\" Clemency A group of Texas legislators sent a letter to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles urging clemency for Wood. On August 19, 2008, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 7‚Äì0 against clemency for Wood.

It includes the historic portion of Skagway, Alaska, including the entire road grid of the 1897 town, as well as the entire valley on the United States side of White Pass all the way to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. This area includes surviving fragments of three historic routes used during the Gold Rush, as well as the route of the White Pass and Yukon Railroad. Almost 100 buildings remain from the Gold Rush period. Portions of the district are preserved as part of Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. Skagway Bazaar shop in 2017 The Skagway portion of the district includes the historic heart of the town, a region 23 block long and varying in width from three to five blocks. Fourteen of these blocks were under National Park Service protection in 1999. Buildings in the district are generally wood frame structures with one or two stories, which have been brightly painted. Commercial buildings often have false fronts, commercial window displays, and recessed entries, and are sited directly against the sidewalk, while residences are set back. The district includes more than 350 buildings in Skagway, and only eight structures outside the city. Arctic Brotherhood Hall The Arctic Brotherhood Hall (1899), its front covered with driftwood, is one of the contributing buildings. The valley that rises steeply above Skagway was one of the main routes to the gold fields of the Yukon River. (The other, the Chilkoot Trail, is located west of Skagway, and is part of the National Historic Landmark Chilkoot Trail and Dyea Site historic district.) Two overland routes, the 1897 trail and the Brackett Wagon Road, worked their way up White Pass, as did a water-based route along the Skagway River, and the White Pass and Yukon Railroad, completed in 1900. Part of the valley now also carries the Klondike Highway. There are numerous areas along these historic routes (some of which have not been identified with precision, and may have followed variable routes during the rush) where camp sites and other remnants of the rush are to be found.

Development and Use The weapon was developed for use by engineer troops after the Siege of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. It illustrated the usefulness of this type of weapon in destroying bunkers and field fortifications otherwise immune to normal artillery. It was a muzzle-loading, rifled mortar that had a standard hydro-spring recoil system. It fired 50 kilogram (110 lb) HE shells, which contained far more explosive filler than ordinary artillery shells of the same caliber. The low muzzle velocity allowed for thinner shell walls, hence more space for filler. Furthermore, the low velocity allowed for the use of explosives like Ammonium Nitrate-Carbon that were less shock-resistant than TNT, which was in short supply. This caused a large number of premature detonations that made crewing the minenwerfer riskier than normal artillery pieces. A new version of the weapon, with a longer barrel, was put into production at some point during the war. It was called the 17 cm mMW n/A (neuer Art) or new pattern, while the older model was termed the a/A (alter Art) or old pattern. In action the mMW was emplaced in a pit, after its wheels were removed, not less than 1.5 meters deep to protect it and its crew. It could be towed short distances by four men or carried by 17. Despite its extremely short range, the mMW proved to be very effective at destroying bunkers and other field fortifications. Consequently, its numbers went from 116 in service when the war broke out to some 2,361 in 1918.The data for this weapon differs between sources and cannot be considered definitive.

He was captain of Somerset from 1938 to 1946 and later prominent in the county club administration. He was born at Batheaston, Somerset and died at Bath, Somerset. Early career Bunty Longrigg was a left-handed middle order batsman and an occasional right-arm bowler. The son of Major G. E. Longrigg, who was a long-time Somerset county cricket committeeman and a solicitor in Bath, the younger Longrigg was educated at Rugby School, and made his Somerset debut in 1925, the year he left school. In his third match, he hit an unbeaten 60 against Kent in a rain-ruined match at Taunton. In 1926, he was at Cambridge University and arrived with a glowing testimonial in the 1926 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack report on 1925 public school cricket by H. S. Altham. \\"His record of 840 runs for an average of over 50 was remarkable,\\" Altham wrote. \\"Above all he watches the ball, and is hard to bowl out. What with his success for Somerset in August, his clever fielding near the wicket, and a capacity to bowl slows of which he might have made more use, Longrigg will be watched very carefully at Cambridge.\\" In the event, Longrigg's first year at Cambridge was a disappointment: he made 77 in the Freshman's trial match and then played in five first-class matches for the university cricket team, but without success, and did not win a blue. Back in the Somerset side for much of the second half of the season, though, he again did well, improving his highest score first with 62 against Derbyshire and then with an unbeaten 81 against Warwickshire. After his poor start in 1926, it took Longrigg a while in 1927 to break into the Cambridge side and with a top score of only 74 and a batting average of 27, he possibly benefited from the illness of Duleepsinhji and injury to Maurice Turnbull in winning a blue. In the University Match, though, he justified his place with a second innings 57 that gave Cambridge the initiative and led to their victory over Oxford. Wisden said that Longrigg displayed \\"much skill\\". By contrast, Longrigg's form for Somerset later in the 1927 was unimpressive, and he did not pass 50 in any innings. In 1928, Longrigg's place in Cambridge's best side seemed to be assured. Mostly he opened the innings and against Sussex early in the season hit an unbeaten 84, his highest score to that point. He achieved little in the University Match, but later in the season with Somerset he improved his highest score again, making 95 against Hampshire after five wickets had fallen 90 on a wet wicket at Weston-super-Mare. In all cricket in 1928, he made 800 runs with an average of 28.57. Full-time cricketer The 1929 and 1930 seasons were the only two where Longrigg was able to play fairly continuous county cricket until he became Somerset captain towards the end of the 1930s. In 1929 he played 25 matches, all but one of them for Somerset, and made 1,123 runs at an average of 24.41. Mostly he batted in the middle order, but it was as an opener that he made the first century of his career, 124 against Warwickshire at Taunton. Wisden noted that his average was lower than in the previous season and that \\"his batting was marked by stubborn defence\\". 1930 was Longrigg's best season as a batsman. He scored 1,567 runs at an average of 30.72 and hit four centuries. These included a double century, the only one of his career: he made 205 against Leicestershire at Taunton, again as an opening batsman. The double century contributed to Somerset's first victory of the season after a depressing start that had brought 10 defeats in 14 games. Irregular cricketer After 1930, Longrigg's career as a solicitor in Bath in the family business increasingly took him away from cricket. In the 1931, 1932 and 1933 seasons he played 12 matches in each season; that tailed off until in 1936 he played only four times. He played more often in home matches than away, and seemed to be available most often in the cricket festival at Bath, where he made at least one appearance every season except 1936. There were glimpses of what the county side might have been missing. Against Yorkshire at Taunton in 1931, he scored exactly 100 out of a total of 177, which merely delayed the inevitable Yorkshire victory by 10 wickets. Two years later, there was 124 against Surrey at Bath, made this time out of a total of 215 and a second century in the same 1933 season against Middlesex at Weston-super-Mare when he shared a second wicket partnership of 184 with Box Case. But these high spots became less frequent as his involvement declined. Somerset captain Bunty Longrigg - Front row, centre In 1937, Longrigg played for Somerset more often, turning out in 11 matches and captaining the side on occasion in the absence of the regular captain, his fellow Bath solicitor Reggie Ingle. At the end of the season, amid some disgruntlement about the side's lack of drive under the amiable Ingle, Longrigg was appointed captain for the 1938 season. The move, Wisden reported in 1939, was a success: Somerset won 10 Championship matches for the first time ever and rose six places up the table to finish seventh. It wrote: \\"Better team-work played an important part in Somerset's achievements, and in this connection they owed much to E. F. Longrigg... if he did not altogether fulfil expectations as a batsman, he certainly left no doubts concerning his qualifications for leadership. Those who closely followed the county's fortunes were impressed by his tact and judgment as well as keenness which often manifested itself.\\" The personal highlight of the season was an unbeaten 187 against Gloucestershire at Bristol, and he added an unbroken 143 in 90 minutes for the eighth wicket with John Barnwell that was the Somerset record for the wicket until beaten by 172 by Viv Richards and Ian Botham in 1983. The 1939 season was more difficult, and Somerset fell back to fourteenth in the Championship. Longrigg's best innings of the season was only 82, against Oxford University, when he had to bat with a runner because of a strain. After the Second World War, Longrigg returned for one final season as Somerset captain and led the side to its best placing in the Championship since 1892. The team finished fourth with a record 12 victories, and Wisden again cited teamwork as an ingredient in the side's success. At the age of 40, Longrigg's was not a great contribution in terms of runs, though he managed four 50s in the season. At the end of the season he stepped down from the captaincy. He made only two further appearances in first-class cricket, both in the 1947 season. Later life Longrigg was an important figure in the administration of Somerset cricket for much of the rest of his life, acting as both county chairman and president. He was involved in some of the fractiousness that surrounded the departure of the professional Harold Stephenson as captain and his replacement by the unpaid Colin Atkinson, and was forced to resign as chairman after a vote of no confidence at a special meeting amid reports of player rebellion.

A soft story building is a multi-story building in which one or more floors have windows, wide doors, large unobstructed commercial spaces, or other openings in places where a shear wall would normally be required for stability as a matter of earthquake engineering design. A typical soft story building is an apartment building of three or more stories located over a ground level with large openings, such as a parking garage or series of retail businesses with large windows. Buildings are classified as having a soft story if that level is less than 70% as stiff as the floor immediately above it, or less than 80% as stiff as the average stiffness of the three floors above it. Soft story buildings are vulnerable to collapse in a moderate to severe earthquake in a phenomenon known as soft story collapse. The inadequately-braced level is relatively less resistant than surrounding floors to lateral earthquake motion, so a disproportionate amount of the building's overall side-to-side drift is focused on that floor. Subject to disproportionate lateral stress, and less able to withstand the stress, the floor becomes a weak point that may suffer structural damage or complete failure, which in turn results in the collapse of the entire building. Soft story failure was responsible for nearly half of all homes that became uninhabitable in California's Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, and was projected to cause severe damage and possible destruction of 160,000 homes in the event of a more significant earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area. As of 2009, few such buildings in the area had undergone the relatively inexpensive seismic retrofit to correct the condition. In 2013, San Francisco mandated screening of soft story buildings to determine if retrofitting is necessary, and required that retrofitting be completed by 2017 through 2020. In Los Angeles in 2016, following San Francisco's ordinance, the city adopted a similar ordinance targeting soft-story apartment buildings first. This ordinance is to reduce structural damage in the event of an earthquake by reinforcing soft-story areas with steel structures. A soft-story building is described as existing wood-frame buildings with soft, weak, or open-front walls and existing non-ductile concrete buildings in the ordinance. Most of these buildings were built before 1978, before building codes were changed. Los Angeles property owners are being targeted by the size of their buildings. The first group of ordinances went out May 2, 2016, with sixteen or more units and more than three stories. The second is July 22, 2016, with sixteen or more units and two stories. The third is October 17, 2016, with sixteen or fewer units and more than three stories. The fourth is January 30, 2017, for nine to fifteen units. The fifth is May 29, 2017 for seven to eight units. The sixth is August 14, 2017, for four to six units. Then on October 30, 2017 condos and commercial buildings will receive their orders to comply. Property owners have two years from the date of the order to have approved plans. Then 3.5 years from the order to obtain the permit. Total completion and certificate of compliance must be issued by seven years of the date. Property owners also have the option to demolish building. Plans must be in order within two years, and permit within 3.5, and demolished by seven years.

He also was the commander of the Duke of Cumberland's Regiment during the American Revolution.  Biography  Charles was the second son of Robert Montagu, 3rd Duke of Manchester. Charles attended Oxford University in 1759 and married Ms. Elizabeth Balmer in 1765. He was also a Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire from 1762-1765. His attempts to enforce the 1765 Stamp Act made him unpopular with the local colonials as governor, and led to his departure during the American Revolution. He tried to be favorable with the colonials and American rebels, having pardoned some of the Regulators. However, it was not enough. During the American Revolutionary War, Montagu began recruiting American prisoners for the Duke of Cumberland's Regiment to fight for the British war with Spanish forces, who were on the colonists side. Charles was captured recruiting soldiers on British prison ships in New York but was released by General Nathanael Greene. Charles even tried to convince American General William Moultrie to join his regiment, but failed. Charles and his recruits made up the Duke of Cumberland's army regiment, and the outfit was discharged in 1783. Charles made it to Halifax, Nova Scotia, with his family (and Joseph Marshall). His Duke of Cumberland's Regiment settled Guysborough. He died soon afterwards and is buried in the crypt of St Paul's Church in Halifax. His tomb states that he died on 3 Feb, 1784, still in his 40s. He was remembered as a good and brave man, who was loyal to his King and Country.

The term is used in earthquake engineering as a classification of certain structures for earthquake safety purposes, and is subject to minor variation from place to place. URM structures are vulnerable to collapse in an earthquake. One problem is that most mortar used to hold bricks together is not strong enough. Additionally, masonry elements may \\"peel\\" from the building, and fall onto occupants or passersby outside. In California, construction of new unreinforced masonry buildings was prohibited in 1933, and state law (enacted in 1986) required seismic retrofitting of existing structures. Retrofits are relatively expensive, and may include the building being tied to its foundation, tying building elements (such as roof and walls) to each other so that the building moves as a single unit rather than creating internal shears during an earthquake, attaching walls more securely to underlying supports so that they do not buckle and collapse, and bracing or removing parapets and other unsecured decorative elements. Retrofits are generally intended to prevent injury and death to people, but not to protect the building itself. According to the 2006-04 California seismic safety commission report, there are still 7800 URM buildings with no retrofitting in the state, including 1100 in the city of Los Angeles. The California law left implementation and standards up to local jurisdictions. Compliance took many years. As of 2008, most (but not all) of the unreinforced masonry buildings have undergone retrofitting. There is particular cause for concern in regions which can generate strong earthquakes, but only rarely. Such regions may not have regulations limiting the construction of UMBs, or have only implemented them recently. Public awareness of earthquake safety may be low. For example, the Wasatch Fault in the U.S. state of Utah closely parallels the state's most populous metropolitan area, the Wasatch Front (which includes the state capital Salt Lake City). The Wasatch Front has a population of 2 million, and contains 200,000 UMBs compared with the entire state of California's 25,000.Deseret News article Utah has recently retrofitted many public UMBs to better withstand earthquakes, but most UMBs in the state are private homes. The lack of earthquake codes preventing the construction of UMBs was a major factor in the high death toll in the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

Cicognini was born in Florence. In 1627, he graduated from the University of Pisa, and he lived in Florence from 1640 to 1645 where he had legal advice to the poet and playwright Giambattista Ricciardi. In 1646 he wrote his first libretto, Il Celio, which was set to music by Sapiti and Baglioni. Later that year he went to Venice, where he began work as the secretary of Francesco Boldieri, a nobleman who handled the property of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem. His fame began to grow, as both playwright and librettist, and his output of plays, tragedies, comedies, and librettos was almost all for theatres and opera houses in Venice. His works were set to music by some of the most famous composers of the day, including Francesco Cavalli, Antonio Cesti, Barbara Strozzi, and Francesco Lucio. He died in Venice. Cicognini was one of the most important figures in seventeenth-century opera, where he brought together elements of tragedy and comedy, and often shows signs of Spanish influence. His most famous works are Giasone (set to music by Cavalli, 1649) and Orontea (set to music by Lucio, 1649 and Cesti, 1656), which were to become the two most popular operas in 17th century Europe.

It was an eclectic show that mixed quirky tunes, comedic informational segments, whimsical monologues, and often humorous interviews with people from all walks of life. The focus was often on people with unusual hobbies or interests; or who had devised strange inventions; or had offbeat stories to tell of things that had happened to them. The show started in 1983, and ended its run at the end of the spring 2002 broadcast season after a 19-year run.http://50plus.com/display.cfm?libraryID=112&cabinetID;=369&documentID;=8259 Arthur Black comes to 50Plus, accessed November 3, 2007 The show was initially broadcast from Thunder Bay but moved to Toronto after several seasons and finally to Vancouver after Black moved to British Columbia in 1995. Format Basic Black was a 90-minute show broadcast on Saturday mornings on the CBC national AM radio network (later known as CBC Radio One) from 10:00 to 11:35 (with a five-minute break at 11:00 for news and weather). Most programs were studio-based, but for some anniversary shows and other special presentations, the show was performed live in front of a theatre audience. Basic Black would usually feature an eclectic mix of offbeat songs (often folk, novelty, or blues numbers, and frequently by Canadian artists), interspersed with interviews. In the last half-hour of the show Arthur Black performed a comedic monologue, often about minor everyday frustrations, and usually with a uniquely Canadian perspective. The show also had several popular recurring segments, including: *\\"World Service\\" Report with George St. John Quimby: This feature had the somewhat pompous, upper-crust George St. John Quimby delivering quirky-but-genuine news items from around the world, often with a focus on particularly eccentric British news stories and performed with an exaggerated \\"there shall always be an England\\" sense of patriotism. In reality, \\"Quimby\\" was a comedic character created and performed by CBC London stringer Nigel Lewis, who also reported straight news for the CBC. The feature ran from 1983 to 1994, before Lewis left Basic Black after a potentially litigious issue over copyright.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/fade-to- black/article1336122/?page=all *The Humline: From 1992 to 2002, Basic Black listeners were invited to leave a message on the Basic Black Humline, singing or humming any half-remembered tune that they couldn't quite figure out the name of. An assembled Humline panel (Arthur Black, Danny Marks, and Shelagh Rogers, later replaced by Dinah Christie) would then try to trace the songs‚Äîmany of them quite obscure‚Äîthat the listeners vaguely remembered from the past. :If the panel was successful, they would then either play the recording of the song, or make a version of their own‚Äîusually on occasions when all they could find was sheet music, no recordings. If stumped, the Humline panel would throw the question out to the listeners. A CD, Hits Of The Humline, was issued in 2000 with some of the panel's favourite selections. The CD featured both original recordings from the 1930s to the 1950s, and a handful of recordings by Marks, Rogers and Black of songs they recorded themselves, including the commercially recorded debut of the theme song to the 1958 CBC TV series Cannonball. *The Dead Dog Cafe: Toward the very end of the show's run, \\"The Dead Dog Cafe\\" was a recurring feature.

These churches, such as other intellectual centres built by Greeks (foundations, schools, etc.), were used also as a meeting-place. The architectural style of these buildings was heavily influenced by the western European architecture. After the Greek War of Independence and the creation of the modern Greek state, the modern Greek architecture tried to combine the traditional Greek architecture and Greek elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. The 19th- century architecture of Athens and other cities of the Greek Kingdom is mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture, with architects such as Theophil Hansen, Ernst Ziller, Panagis Kalkos, Lysandros Kaftanzoglou and Stamatios Kleanthis. History Architecture was built using bated and phenixes-a special type of grass in Greece mixed in white paste. Urban plan of Patras, 1830 The architecture of the modern Greek cities, especially the old centres (\\"old towns\\") is mostly influenced either by the Ottoman or the Venetian architecture, two forces that dominated the Greek space from the early modern period. After the Greek Independence, the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. Patras was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, Stamatis Voulgaris, a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor Kapodistrias, who approved it. Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras. However his initial plan was modified in 1830. Two special genres can be considered the Cycladic architecture, featuring whitewashedhouses, in the Cyclades and the Epirotic architecture in the region of Epirus, featuring stone houses. After the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture. For Athens, the first King of Greece, Otto of Greece, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state. =Neoclassical examples= File:Akademie von Athen.jpgThe Academy of Athens designed by Theophil Hansen (1859) File:Universit√§t von Athen.jpgThe University of Athens designed by Christian Hansen (1859) File:Griechische Nationalbibliothek (Zuschnitt).jpgThe National Library designed by Theophil Hansen (1888) File:Apollon theatre.JPGThe Apollon Theatre of Patras, designed by Ernst Ziller (1872) File:ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÅœáŒµŒØŒø ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ 9734.jpgAthens City Hall (1874) by Panagis Kalkos File:Old Parliament Athens.JPGOld Parliament House, Athens (1875) by Panagis Kalkos/Fran√ßois Boulanger File:Koraes Public Library in Chios.jpgKorais public library of Chios (1885) File:Peiraias teatr.jpgMunicipal Theatre of Piraeus (1895) File:ŒñœâœÉŒπŒºŒ±ŒØŒ± Œ£œáŒøŒªŒÆ ŒôœâŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒØŒΩœâŒΩ 01.jpgZosimaia School building, Ioannina (1905) File:Narodna banka Grƒçke - panoramio.jpgNational Bank of Greece in Thessaloniki (1928) File:Mytilini - Pr√§fektur von Lesbos.jpgPrefecture of Lesbos (early 20th) File:ŒòŒïŒ£Œ£ŒëŒõŒüŒùŒôŒöŒó- ŒöŒëŒõŒëŒúŒëŒ°ŒôŒë- Œ§Œü Œ†ŒëŒõŒëŒ§ŒëŒöŒô - panoramio (7).jpgGovernment House, Thessaloniki (1960) In 1917 most of Thessaloniki's old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a commission of architects headed by French architect Ernest H√©brard. In 1933 was signed the Athens Charter, a manifesto of the modernist movement which published later by Le Corbusier. Architects of this movement were among others the Bauhaus- architect Ioannis Despotopoulos, Dimitris Pikionis, Patroklos Karantinos and Takis Zenetos. =Antiparochi laws= In 1929, two important laws concerning apartment buildings took effect. The law about \\"horizontal property\\" made it possible that many different owners own one apartment building, each by owning one or more apartment units. Theoretically, each apartment corresponds to a percentage of the original plot. The most important effect of this law was the practice of \\"Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÄŒ±œÅŒøœáŒÆ\\" (antiparoch√≠, literally \\"a supply in exchange\\"). With antiparoch√≠, the owner of a plot, who can't afford to build an apartment building by himself, makes a contract with a construction company so that the latter will build the apartment building but keep the ownership of as many apartments as the contract states. Although during the inter-war period the practice of antiparoch√≠ was limited, as the construction of most apartment buildings was financed solely by the original owners of the plot, antiparoch√≠ became the most common method for financing the construction of condominiums (polykatoik√≠es) from the 1950s onwards.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 65‚Äì67. However this practice had the negative effect of the destruction of many old-era (mostly of 19th century) buildings and mansions in the major Greek cities, to be replaced by common apartment buildings. Even today (2019), the owners of old buildings or mansions, listed as architecturally preserved, prefer to let them collapse to avoid the preservation cost and exploit the plot. After World War II and the Greek civil war, this practice (the massive construction of condominiums in the major Greek city-centres) was a major contributory factor for the Greek economy and the post-war recovery. The first scycrapers were also constructed during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the OTE Tower and the Athens Tower Complex. Acropolis Museum During the 1960s and 1970s, Xenia was a nationwide hotel construction program initiated by the Hellenic Tourism Organisation (ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒüœÅŒ≥Œ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ Œ§ŒøœÖœÅŒπœÉŒºŒøœç, EOT) to improve the country's tourism infrastructure. It constitutes one of the largest infrastructure projects in modern Greek history. The first manager of the project was the architect Charalambos Sfaellos (from 1950 to 1958) and from 1957 the buildings were designed by a team under Aris Konstantinidis. Famous foreign architects who have also designed buildings in Greece during the 20th and 21st century, include Walter Gropius, Eero Saarinen and Mario Botta. Several new buildings were also constructed by Santiago Calatrava for the 2004 Athens Olympics, while Bernard Tschumi designed the New Acropolis Museum. Recently in 2012 Renzo Piano designed the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center (completed in 2016).

It is an American college football rivalry game played by the LSU Tigers football team of Louisiana State University and the Tulane Green Wave football team of Tulane University. The game was played nearly every year since its inception in 1893, with the last of ninety-eight games being played in 2009. Tulane and LSU spent much of their athletic histories as members of the same conference: the SIAA from 1899 to 1920, the Southern Conference from 1922 to 1932, and as charter members of the SEC from 1932 to 1966. The \\"Rag\\" The 1914 0‚Äì0 tie between the teams The winner is awarded a satin trophy flag known as the Tiger Rag at LSU and the Victory Flag at Tulane. The flag is divided diagonally, with the logos of each school placed on opposite sides and the Seal of Louisiana in the center. LSU's name for the flag comes from the popular tune Tiger Rag, one of the songs performed by the Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band. The December 1973 matchup at Tulane Stadium The original flag was created in 1940 to foster good sportsmanship, most likely in response to growing tension between fans of the two teams that eventually escalated into a riot after Tulane's victory in 1938. It is believed that this flag was destroyed in a 1982 fire at Tulane's University Center. In 2001, LSU and Tulane worked together to create a reconstruction of the rag based upon archived photographs. 2006 series renewal In 2006 the rivalry was officially renewed, returning to yearly play for the first time since 1994. The teams began play that year and continued until 2009, when it was announced that LSU would pay Tulane $700,000 to void the final six years of the home-and-home series. LSU held that it would benefit if the remaining games were all played in Baton Rouge. Not wanting to give up its home games, Tulane agreed to end the series early, though the teams did agree to play one future game in New Orleans.

The ch√¢teau was built in 1740 by Gaudot, an architect of the school of Rome, from the remains of an earlier 16th-century ch√¢teau.Ministry of Culture: Ch√¢teau dit d'H√©rouville In the 19th century, it was used as a courier relay station (between Versailles and Beauvais) and stabled a hundred horses. Several accounts, including one by the BBC, suggest that in the mid-19th Century, composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin conducted his love affair with the writer George Sand there.https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35152716 The ch√¢teau was painted by Vincent van Gogh, who is buried nearby. The estate also doubled as a recording studio, producing now iconic hit records throughout the 1970s.  Architecture  The ch√¢teau comprises two wings, plus a number of outbuildings. It has 30 rooms, a swimming pool and a tennis court and is set in 1,7 hectares of parkland. An octagonal stone drinking trough in the courtyard is a protected historical monument. History of recording studio The composer Michel Magne purchased the chateau in 1962. He was best known for having been nominated in 1962 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment for Gigot. He converted the building into a residential recording studio after a fire devastated its left wing in 1969. The musician, director and sound engineer Laurent Thibault took over management of the studio in June 1974. The studio has been referred to by many names in album credits including Studio H√©rouville, Ch√¢teau d'H√©rouville, Michel Magne Studios, Strawberry Studios, and by the nickname Honky Chateau.https://www.discogs.com/label/266406-Strawberry-Studios-France Rex Foster's Roads of Tomorrow was the first album recorded at Ch√¢teau in 1969-70, and released on Barclay/RCA in 1971.

Jerry Garcia tells the story: A recording of the Grateful Dead's performance is available online. During the first years of the studio, in 1971 and 1972, some important records of political Portuguese folk music (M√∫sica de Interven√ß√£o) were recorded at Ch√¢teau d'H√©rouville. These included the seminal record Cantigas do Maio by singer-songwriter Jos√© Afonso in 1971. Also in 1971, Jos√© M√°rio Branco recorded his debut album Mudam-se os tempos mudam-se as vontades and S√©rgio Godinho recorded Os Sobreviventes. S√©rgio Godinho would also record his second album Pr√©-Hist√≥rias at the chateau in 1972. Many other artists recorded there, many of whom were British, beginning with Elton John, who recorded his albums Honky Ch√¢teau (the title inspired by the house), Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player (both in 1972) and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973) there. Chris Bell, of the Memphis-based cult band Big Star, recorded solo tracks with Apple Records engineer Claude Harper at the studio in September and October 1974. The songs, recorded along with drummer Richard Rosebrough, would be released on his now acclaimed I Am the Cosmos LP.

This site has artifacts from the Birnirk cultureNHL Alaska details as well as the first discovery in Alaska of the later Thule culture. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962 for its archaeological significance. Description The Wales site is located on the south shore of the Seward Peninsula of northwestern Alaska, very near Cape Prince of Wales, the westernmost point in North America. The area is archaeologically sensitive, with a significant number of sites clustered in an area between the native village of Wales and the former Tin City Air Force Station. The Kurigitavik Mound (whose most recent survey designation is TEL-079) has been the focus of significant archaeological activity since the 1920s, when it was first examined by the pioneering Canadian anthropologist Diamond Jenness. It was again excavated by Henry B. Collins of the Smithsonian Institution in the 1930s, and by Don Dumond in the 1970s. Most recently it has been the subject of an extensive investigation by Roger B. Harritt, beginning in the late 1990s and extending into the 2000s.Re-examining Wales' Role in Bering Strait Prehistory: Some Preliminary Results of Recent Work by Roger Harritt of the University of Alaska Anchorage Finds at the site have included nearly complete partially subterranean house structures, including one in which seemingly ritualistically placed walrus skulls were found. Tools found at the site include barbed harpoon heads and bowls fashioned from baleen in a layer dated to the Punuk period (c. 800-1400 CE). The site is significant because it appears to include shifting cultural uses over time, between cultural groups engaged in different practices and originating either from other parts of Alaska or from Siberia. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962 for its archaeological significance, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

The term captain of sea and war, like the modern rank of ship-of-the-line captain in the navies of France, Italy, and Spain, has deep historic roots. Although the rank was first formally established in the 17th century, the expression had been sometimes been used in the Portuguese and Spanish (as Capit√°n de Mar y Guerra) armadas of the 16th century. But generally, in the 16th and early 17th centuries, the captain of a Portuguese man-of-war was simply called a capit√£o, while the commander of a fleet was termed capit√£o-mor, literally \\"captain-major\\". During the 16th century, the term almirante was used in Portugal to designate the second in command of a fleet. Only during the 18th century would it come to designate the fleet commander - an admiral in the more modern sense. But during the latter half of the 17th century, the term \\"captain of sea and war\\" came to designate the commander of a larger man-of-war - the ship of the line that began evolving at that time. When that happened, the Portuguese Navy, as other navies, came to use the term capit√£o de fragata and capit√£o-tenente, literally \\"frigate captain\\" and \\"captain-lieutenant\\", to designate the commanders of smaller warships. When Brazil gained her independence from Portugal in 1822, its navy adopted the Portuguese rank denominations, which both countries still use. Today, the rank of captain of sea and war exists in the navies of Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau.

They are contained in the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park which preserves the historic buildings and locations connected to the Klondike Gold Rush period of Alaskan history. For a brief period between 1897 and 1899, this trail and town were full of prospectors. By 1905, most of the buildings had been demolished or removed. Both the trail and the town site are part of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. Dyea Dyea is a ghost town located at the convergence of the Taiya River and Taiya Inlet on the south side of the Chilkoot Pass within the limits of the Municipality of Skagway Borough, Alaska. During the Klondike Gold Rush prospectors disembarked at its port and used the Chilkoot Trail, a Tlingit trade route over the Coast Mountains, to begin their journey to the gold fields around Dawson City, Yukon, about away. Confidence man and crime boss Soapy Smith, famous for his underworld control of the neighboring town of Skagway in 1897-98 is believed to have had control of Dyea as well.Smith, Jeff (2009). Alias Soapy Smith: The Life and Death of a Scoundrel, Klondike Research. pp. 450-51. The port at Dyea had shallow water, while neighboring Skagway had deep water. Dyea was abandoned when the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad chose the White Pass Trail, which begins in Skagway, over the Chilkoot Trail Chilkoot Trail The Chilkoot Trail is a trail through the Coast Mountains that leads from Dyea to Bennett, British Columbia, in Canada. Tlingit First Nations used the trail as a vital trade route to trade for resources available in the interior. As pressures from American settlers and the Hudson's Bay Company weakened the traditional Tlingit trading system, the Chilkoot Trail slowly became utilized by explorers and prospectors. The Klondike Gold Rush transformed the Chilkoot Trail into a mainstream transportation route to Canada's interior. The gold rush was primarily focused in the region around Dawson City in Yukon and the Yukon River. Of the several overland routes, the Chilkoot Trail was the most direct, least expensive, and, soon enough, most popular. It was eclipsed by the construction of the railway from Skagway, and was soon abandoned.

Starring Sarah Lancashire as protagonist Angela Cannings, the drama is based on Cannings' wrongful conviction for the deaths of two of her infant children, Jason and Matthew. Directed by Robin Sheppard, the drama also stars Timothy Spall as Angela's husband Terry, Emma Cunniffe as Angela's sister Claire; and Ian McNeice as her defence barrister; Bill Bache. The drama was a joint production between the BBC's drama and current affairs wings. 5.18 million viewers tuned in for the initial broadcast. Similarly to other true- life BBC productions of the time; Cherished has never been released on DVD. Cannings herself said of the production; \\"We're still suffering the aftermath of this whole episode. This film is for Jade, so when she is older she can see what it was all about. The general public would assume that we've got back together and that's it. But there is an awful lot of healing. It doesn't just heal overnight. Even now I sit and think why we had to go through all that. We've had quite a lot to do with the scriptwriter, the BBC has been very good. They've dealt with us very fairly.\\" Sarah Lancashire said of playing the part of Cannings; \\"I'm delighted to be playing the part of Angela. When I read the script I was very moved. The loss of any child is a dreadful thing, the loss of three is unimaginable. Whilst any parent could relate to the anguish that Terry and Angela must have felt I cannot comprehend the strength it must have taken to sustain Angela through even a part of a life sentence. Theirs is a remarkable story.\\" Synopsis The film begins in 1999, on the day of Matthew Cannings' death. Mother Angela (Sarah Lancashire), who is alone in the house at the time, is roused by the sound of a sleep apnea alarm fitted to Matthew's cot. Angela enters his room, only to find that Matthew is already dead. Angela immediately telephones her husband Terry (Timothy Spall), who rushes home from work and is shocked to discover Angela cradling Matthew in her arms. After Matthew is taken to the local hospital, the Cannings' doctor informs social services that Matthew's death is the third such death in the family since 1989. Two vulnerable persons detectives, DS Rob Findlay (Jake Nightingale) and WDC Jill Dawson (Alison Lomas), take on the case and interview Angela. As a post-mortem reveals traces of fibres in Matthew's nasal passage, Findlay and Dawson suspect that Matthew was smothered; although the evidence is not conclusive. Angela is arrested and taken in for questioning. Despite denying all of the accusations against her, Angela is charged with the murder of Matthew and two of her other children, Gemma and Jason, who died in 1989 and 1991 respectively. The case is taken to court, and Angela is represented by defence lawyer Bill Bache (Ian McNeice), who is convinced that the jury cannot possibly find her guilty due to a lack of corroborative evidence and eyewitness testimony. Despite this, Angela is found guilty on two counts of murder (the other count, of Gemma's murder, is dropped before the trial begins). Angela goes to prison and faces daily abuse from her fellow inmates, who label her a 'nonce' and a 'baby killer'. Whilst in prison, a woman claiming to be Angela's half-sister comes forward, and through dogged detective work, Bache and his team of colleagues uncover a genetic history of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in Angela's extended family. Coupled with the recent acquittal of Sally Clark, who was tried and found guilty of the murder of her two children based on statistical evidence provided by Sir Roy Meadow (Ronald Pickup), who also provided evidence in Angela's trial, Bache launches an appeal. On appeal, Angela's conviction is quashed and she is released from prison. Subsequently, an epilogue reveals that Angela's trial allowed for a change in the law which states that no single defendant can be found guilty in a criminal trial purely on the basis of evidence submitted by experts. Roy Meadow is also revealed to have been struck off by the General Medical Council.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Nomenclature The genus name 'Brunfelsia' commemorates sixteenth century German monk, Otto Brunfels.D. Gledhill The specific epithet pauciflora is Latin for 'few-flowered'.Allen J. Coombes Description Shrub setting This species is a shrub up to 2.4 meters tall by 1.5 wide whose bark is greyish brown and mostly smooth and only occasionally interrupted by longitudinal cracks. The sparsely existing branches stand upright to spread. The dark green, smooth branches are strong and glabrous, rarely covered with fluff- haired or glandular trichomes. The leathery leaves are up to 16 centimeters long, dark green on top and paler on the undersides. The leaves are distributed on the branches or as a group at the branch tips. The hairless petioles have a length of 5 to 12 mm. The firmly membranous to almost leathery leaf blade is 6.5 to 16 cm long and 2 to 6.5 cm wide, elongated to elongate- lanceolate, rarely elliptic-oblong to ovate-elongated. The tip is pointed to short pointed, rarely blunted to notched. The base of the leaf blade is wedge- shaped to tapered. The leaf surface is glabrous or dotted on the underside of the midrib or slightly glandular hairy. The top is dark green, dull to shiny, the underside is light green. From the midrib go five to eleven side veins that run straight or in a wide arc. The four stamens set in the upper part of the floral tube, the white stamens are almost circular, somewhat trough-shaped in the direction of the dust bag. The upper pair of stamens has 4 to 6 mm long stamens, the lower stamens are 2 to 4 mm long. The greenish-brown anthers are 1.5 to 2 mm long and circular to kidney-shaped. The bright green ovary is 2 to 3 mm high and has a diameter of 1.5 mm, it is conical-ovate shaped. The thread-like stylus has a length of 25 to 30 mm and is coloured lavender.

Range It occurs mainly on the Atlantic facing slopes of the Serra do Mar in southeastern Brazil. The distribution areas are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina, where they range from sea level to altitudes of 1500 m. Most are found in pluvial rainforests with an annual rainfall of up to 1600 mm. One finds plants of the kind on shady river banks and ravines, as well as in forests in damp, well draining soils. Toxicity The roots of several species corresponding to the genus Brunfelsia contain substances whose consumption can cause problems in human health according to the compendium published by the European Food Safety Authority in 2012. In particular they contain indole alkaloids derived from Beta-carboline such as harmine, tetrahydroharmine, harmaline, manacin, manacein, and dimethyltryptamine and amidine derivatives such as pyrrole 3-carboxamidine.

By 1974 the secondary school population had grown to over 3,000 students, far too many for the existing buildings of DCHS to accommodate in a regular school day. Beginning in August 1974, the county had to resort to double sessions. This meant that those students designated to attend Lithia Springs HS would attend the afternoon session, starting at about 11:00 and going until about 5:30. Construction and weather problems delayed the grand opening of LSHS until December, 1975.

With a long neck possessing vertebrae bearing distinctively-shaped \\"shark fin\\"-shaped neural spines, and a relatively small and pointed head, Brancasaurus is superficially similar to Elasmosaurus, albeit smaller in size at in length. The type species of this genus is Brancasaurus brancai, first named by Theodor Wegner in 1914 in honor of German paleontologist Wilhelm von Branca. Another plesiosaur named from the same region, Gronausaurus wegneri, most likely represents a synonym of this genus. While traditionally considered as a basal member of the Elasmosauridae, Brancasaurus has more recently been recovered as a member, or close relative, of the Leptocleididae, a group containing many other freshwater plesiosaurs. Description pycnodontiform fish, with Caturus and Hybodus in the far background Brancasaurus was a medium-sized plesiosaur, at in length; the holotype specimen is likely a subadult, judging by the unfused sutures in the vertebrae as well as the development of processes on the limbs and pubis. =Skull= (a) The skull of Brancasaurus as interpreted by Wegner, (b) the present condition of the fossil material, (c) an interpretation of the skull after Sachs et al., (d) a life restoration. The skull of the holotype, which measures long, is long and narrow, with a tapered snout that slopes downwards at an angle of 15¬∞. The eye sockets were roughly the same size as the temporal openings immediately behind them. A narrow, rounded ridge along the middle of the top surface of the skull extends from near the front of the premaxilla to the back of the eye sockets. The frontal bones form a rectangular bar that separates the eye sockets down the middle. A ridge running across the bar intersects with the forward-extending ridge to produce a dagger-shaped protrusion. The jugal bone, which extends from the bottom of the eye socket back to the level of the temporal openings, is entirely bordered on its bottom by the maxilla. The squamosal bones arch around to form the curved back of the skull, and bear a ridge on top for attachment of neck muscles. There is also a ridge at the point where the two bones fuse. A cast of the braincase shows impressions of the semicircular canals and membranous inner ear, as well as canals of the hypoglossal, accessory, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves, which can also be observed on the bony exoccipital-opisthotic of the braincase. On the imperfectly-preserved lower jaw, the coronoid eminence seems to be relatively low, judging by the narrow and slightly curved top edge of the surangular bone. While the teeth have been lost, they were initially described as long, slender, and awl-shaped, with rough ridges on the outer surfaces. Although it has been suggested that Brancasaurus had very reduced tooth sockets in the premaxilla, as in Leptocleidus, this is impossible to verify because of damage to this portion of the skull. =Vertebral column= Cervical vertebrae in lateral (a) and dorsal (b) views, showing distinctive neural spines The entire neck bears 37 cervical vertebrae, and is approximately long. The centra of the vertebrae are wider than they are tall or long. Both ends of each vertebra are slightly concave, meaning that the vertebrae are amphicoelous. The sides of the vertebrae are likewise weakly concave; unlike many other long-necked plesiosaurs, they did not bear a ridge on the side (although this may be affected by age). The neural spines of the vertebrae are distinctively shaped like shark fins, being high and triangular. There are three pectoral vertebrae at the neck-body transition, which are weakly concave, taller than they are long, and have rectangular-shaped neural spines that are directed slightly backwards. The cervical and pectoral vertebrae have deep indentations through which the notochord passed. The 19 dorsal vertebrae are similar to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail. =Limbs and limb girdles= Limb elements: (a) humerus, (b) femur, (c) entire hindlimb The interclavicle is a large plate with a smooth upper surface and a prominent groove on the bottom surface. It also bears a small, pointed projection at its back end. The scapulae have prominent shelves on each side (diagnostic of leptocleidids and polycotylids, but not strongly differentiated in elasmosaurids), and their glenoids are clearly concave, with roughened attachments for cartilage. The two coracoids curve outwards in the middle and contact at their ends, forming a hole in the middle, although the exact morphology of this hole is uncertain. The regions where the coracoids contact is vaulted and thickened to form a weak, ridge-like projection, comparable to but probably convergently acquired from elasmosaurids. The pubes form a somewhat rectangular dish, with a convex front edge and concave outer edge, while the ischia are flat, triangular, and plate-like. The edges of the pubes where they meet the ischia curve inwards from the midline to each side. The corresponding edges of the ischia are similarly-shaped, with the curved edges of the bones collectively forming two rounded fenestrae that are connected in the center by a small rhombus-shaped opening, as also seen in Futabasaurus. The ilia are rod-shaped and bent, with blunt projections halfway along their outer rims; at the top end, they are flattened into a fan-like shape. The humeri, which have a length of about , are oval in cross-section, and about half as wide as they are long at the widest point. Their leading edges are curved in an S-shape, a trait also seen in Leptocleidus, Hastanectes, polycotylids, and the elasmosaurid Wapuskanectes, but not in Nichollssaura. The only femur that is presently available is long; it is concave on one edge, whereas the other edge is straight near the top but curves sharply near the bottom. The rest of the long bones of the limb have been lost. Allegedly, the radius was similar to but smaller and straighter than the tibia, and there was a hole present between the tibia and fibula. The 14 preserved phalanges, which likely include elements from both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs, are long and hourglass- shaped. =Possible soft tissue= Soft tissue was apparently preserved with the specimen, but was subsequently removed during preparation. Covering the limbs and the rest of the body was a layer of smooth, multilayered calcite, which was originally interpreted as preservation of decaying skin. Additionally, an accumulation of sediment in the abdominal region may have represented gut contents, with both gastroliths and digested bones. However, since both samples of the alleged soft tissue are no longer available, it is impossible to verify these interpretations. Discovery and naming Skull of Brancasaurus in dorsal (a) and lateral (b) view, showing the tip of the snout (c) in ventral view (1914) The holotype specimen of Brancasaurus brancai is GPMM A3.B4, stored at the University of M√ºnster. It originates from a clay pit near the city of Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The specimen was discovered in July 1910 by workers in the clay pit, who dug it out using pickaxes; in doing so, they damaged the specimen (in particular, the pubis had been broken into 176 pieces), and left behind a number of small fragments that were later personally collected by paleontologist Theodor Wegner, who in 1928 described the specimen in detail. The skeleton is fairly complete, consisting of various parts of the skull, most of the vertebrae, several isolated ribs and gastralia, parts of the pectoral and pelvic girdles, both humeri, one femur, and various foot bones from the flippers. Over time, a number of parts have been lost, including several pieces of the skull, teeth, gastralia and caudal vertebrae, a second femur, and a radius, tibia, and fibula. A wax endocast of the brain of the type specimen is stored as SMF R4076 in the Naturmuseum Senckenberg. The clay pit from which the type specimen originates is part of the Isterberg Formation in the B√ºckeberg Group, also known in the past as the \\"German Wealden facies\\". The B√ºckeberg Group, which is divided into six zones, belongs to the Berriasian of the Cretaceous, with the boundary between the Berriasian and the Valanginian being at the top of the group. The parts of the Isterberg Formation exposed at Gronau belong to the zones \\"Wealden 5\\" and \\"Wealden 6\\", which correspond to the uppermost-Berriasian. A second, more fragmentary subadult individual, GZG.BA.0079, consists of the pubis, ischium, and several vertebral components; it originates from the slightly lower Deister Formation (\\"Wealden 3\\") in the B√ºckeberg Group, and can only be referred to Brancasaurus sp., since it is relatively incomplete and differs in several minor vertebral characteristics from the type of B. brancai. Other probable but isolated Brancasaurus elements come from outcrops of the Isterberg and Fuhse Formations in Lower Saxony; the latter formation is also in the B√ºckeberg Group. Referred specimen GPMM A3.B2, the holotype of Gronausaurus =Synonyms= The specimen GPMM A3.B2 consists of teeth, parts of the jaws, the braincase and other fragmentary parts of the skull, vertebrae, pieces of ribs, part of the pectoral girdle, the entire pelvic girdle, one complete and one partial humerus, an ulna, two femora, a fibula, and various foot bones. While this specimen was originally assigned to Brancasaurus, Hampe (2013) referred it to a new genus and species, Gronausaurus wegneri. It was discovered some higher in the stratigraphic column than the type specimen of Brancasaurus. Later analysis found that this specimen, which was mature, was virtually indistinguishable from the type of Brancasaurus with the exception of the length of the ischium, the height of the cervical neural spines, the width of the cervical centra, and whether the dorsal neural spines are constricted at their base. These minor differences can probably be attributed to either individual-based or age-based variation, supporting G. wegneri as a junior synonym of B. brancai. E. Koken named Plesiosaurus limnophilus in 1887 based on isolated cervical vertebrae from outcrops of the B√ºckeberg Group in Lower Saxony. From the same locality, Koken subsequently named two further species of Plesiosaurus, P. degenhardti and P. kanzleri, and also referred some material to P. valdensis. All of this material is not particularly diagnostic, and has been partially lost; thus, they have been considered nomina dubia. Sachs et al. considered all of these to represent remains of Brancasaurus, with the exception of P. degenhardti, which was retained as a nomen dubium on account of lacking the distinctive cervical neural spines of Brancasaurus. Classification Skeletal reconstruction in lateral and ventral views Initially, Brancasaurus was assigned to the Elasmosauridae by Wegner. He noted, however, that it had a shorter neck and a narrower head, as well as various distinctive morphologies of the skull roof, teeth, and vertebrae (especially the \\"shark fin\\"-shaped neural spines of the cervical vertebrae) compared to other members of the group known at the time. A number of subsequent studies have considered Brancasaurus as a basal member of the Elasmosauridae, with some even using Brancasaurus to define the clade. Nevertheless, a number of contrary taxonomic opinions have been expressed; in particular, Theodore E. White created a new family, Brancasauridae, to contain Brancasaurus, Seeleyosaurus, and \\"Thaumatosaurus\\", a defunct genus with species now belonging to Rhomaleosaurus and Meyerasaurus. An alternative phylogenetic hypothesis that has gained substantial traction places Brancasaurus in the clade Leptocleididae, along with other leptocleidids including Leptocleidus itself, Vectocleidus, Umoonasaurus, Nichollssaura, and also possibly Hastanectes. This result has been recovered by the phylogenies of Benson et al., who have also noted a number of morphological traits which ally Brancasaurus with the more general Leptocleidia. A 2016 phylogenetic analysis conducted by Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; or as the sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition to the fact that the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results can be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements. Topology A: Brancasaurus in the Leptocleididae, based on Benson et al. (2013) Topology B: Brancasaurus outside Leptocleididae, based on Benson & Druckenmiller (2014) Paleoecology Map of Central Europe during the Berriasian; locations with Brancasaurus are marked with a star The B√ºckeberg Group, from which Brancasaurus originates, likely represented a large, continental freshwater lake that the surrounding uplands drained into. In turn, the lake itself was temporarily connected to the Boreal Sea via a passage to the west. During the time at which the layers of \\"Wealden 5\\" and \\"Wealden 6\\" were deposited, the lake expanded and became more brackish as a result of marine transgression. The deposited sediments probably represent the oxygen-poor bottom portion of the lake, with the plesiosaurs of the B√ºckeberg Group being presumably preserved after they sank through the water column to the bottom. Asides from Brancasaurus, other constituents of the B√ºckeberg Group are benthic invertebrates, including neomiodontid bivalves; hybodont sharks, including Hybodus, Egertonodus, Lonchidion, and Lissodus; the actinopterygian fish Caturus, Lepidotes, Coelodus, Sphaerodus, Ionoscopus, and Callopterus, which Brancasaurus would have preyed on in surface waters; the turtle Desmemys; crocodilians, including Goniopholis, Pholidosaurus, and Theriosuchus; the theropod Altispinax; the marginocephalian Stenopelix; and an ankylosaur referred to Hylaeosaurus.

Ayer. The song was one of the first with a twelve-bar opening. The tune has been recorded hundreds of times by many artists from first publication until recent times. Lyrics =Verse 1= : Honey dear, when you're near, : Just turn out the light and then come over here, : Nestle close, up to my side, : My heart's on fire, with love's desire. : In my arms, rest complete, : I never thought that life could ever be so sweet, : 'til I met you some time ago, : But now I know I love you so. =Chorus= :Oh! you beautiful doll, :You great big beautiful doll! :Let me put my arms about you, :I could never live without you; :Oh! you beautiful doll, :You great big beautiful doll! :If you ever leave me how my heart will ache, :I want to hug you but I fear you'd break :Oh, oh, oh, oh, :Oh, you beautiful doll! =Second verse= : Precious prize, close your eyes, : Now we're goin' to visit love's paradise, : Press your lips again to mine, : Love is king of ev'ry thing, : Squeeze me dear, I don't care! : Hug me just as if you were a grizzly bear, : This is how I'll go through life, : No care or strife, when you're my wife. Notable use in film As well as being used in the 1949 film of the same name, the tune had been featured in several major movies -- The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939), For Me and My Gal (1942), Broadway Rhythm (1944), Strangers on a Train (1951), The Eddie Cantor Story (1953) and The Taming of the Shrew (1969) as well as some Looney Tunes cartoons such as Hair-Raising Hare. The Kidsongs Kids and Billy and Ruby Biggle sang this song with a baby elephant named Belle in their 1995 video and DVD: \\"Baby Animal Songs\\". The song also appears on the animated series Hey Arnold! where Grandpa Phil sings the song while taking a shower, as well as in the last Fred Astaire variety special, in which he and dance partner Barrie Chase danced to it.

It is a central part of corporate law and corporate governance. Directors' duties are analogous to duties owed by trustees to beneficiaries, and by agents to principals. Among different jurisdictions, a number of similarities between the framework for directors' duties exist. *directors owe duties to the corporation,e.g. Percival v Wright [1902] Ch 421 and not to individual shareholders,e.g. , where the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that \\"depending upon all the surrounding circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder,\\" employees or creditors outside exceptional circumstances *directors' core duty is to remain loyal to the company, and avoid conflicts of interest *directors are expected to display a high standard of care, skill or diligence *directors are expected to act in good faith to promote the success of the corporation  Australia  = General Law = Directors have Fiduciary Duties under general law in Australia. They are: *Duty to act in good faith and not to act contrary to the interest of the company *Duty not to use power for an improper purpose *Duty to avoid conflicts of interest .. *Duty to retain discretion =Statutory Duties= Directors also have duties under Corporations Act 2001: *Section 181: Mirrors the general law duty to act in good faith, in the best interests of the company and for proper purpose. *Section 182: Duty not to misuse position to gain advantage *Section 183: Duty not to misuse information to gain advantage =Breach of Duties= There is an important distinction between the general law and statute in that there are different consequences when it comes for breach *If a director is acting dishonestly or recklessly then there will be criminal liability imported under statute. But not in general law. *At general law where a director breaches their duties the likely remedy will be equitable damages or statutory compensation or recission. But within context of statute it is not possible. If it is a statutory duty, ASIC will enforce statute. Canada =Tripartite Fiduciary Duty= In Canada, a debate exists on the precise nature of directors' duties following the controversial landmark judgment in BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders. This Supreme Court of Canada decision has raised questions as to the nature and extent to which directors owe a duty to non-shareholders. Scholarly literature has defined this as a \\"tripartite fiduciary duty\\", composed of (1) an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains two component duties ‚Äî (2) a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and (3) a procedural duty of \\"fair treatment\\" for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the \\"best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen\\". United States =Business judgment= *Smith v. Van Gorkom, 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985) and ¬ß102)b)(7) DGCL *Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., 204 Mich. 459, 170 N.W. 668 (1919) *Aronson v. Lewis *In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation 698 A 2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996) *In re Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation 907 A.2d 693 (Del. Ch. 2005) United Kingdom =Acting within powers= *s.171 Companies Act 2006 Directors are also strictly charged to exercise their powers only for a proper purpose. For instance, were a director to issue a large number of new shares, not for the purposes of raising capital but to defeat a potential takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.. However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions that would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution. Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper. The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the Privy Council decision of Howard Smith Ltd v. Ampol Ltd.. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new shares.Following Hogg v. Cramphorn Ltd. [1967] Ch 254 It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. The court rejected an argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital as too narrow, and held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.Teck Corporation v. Millar (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288 If so, an incidental result (even desirable) that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose. Not all jurisdictions recognised the \\"proper purpose\\" duty as separate from the \\"good faith\\" duty however.This division was rejected in British Columbia in Teck Corporation v. Millar (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288 =Promoting company success= *s.172 Companies Act 2006, \\"to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole\\". It sets out six factors to which a director must have regards in fulfilling the duty to promote success. These are: * the likely consequences of any decision in the long term * the interests of the company‚Äôs employees * the need to foster the company‚Äôs business relationships with suppliers, customers and others * the impact of the company‚Äôs operations on the community and the environment * the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and * the need to act fairly as between members of a company This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the Companies Act 1985, protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see e.g., s.309, which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but that could be enforced only by the shareholders, and not by the employees themselves. The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.Director's duties Directors must act honestly and in bona fide. The test is a subjective one‚Äîthe directors must act in \\"good faith in what they consider‚Äînot what the court may consider‚Äîis in the interests of the company...\\" per Lord Greene MR.Re Smith & Fawcett Ltd [1942] Ch 304 However, the directors may still be held to have failed in this duty where they fail to direct their minds to the question of whether in fact a transaction was in the best interests of the company.Re W & M Roith Ltd [1967] 1 WLR 432 Difficult questions arise when treating the company too abstractly. For example, it may benefit a corporate group as a whole for a company to guarantee the debts of a \\"sister\\" company,a company with 100% the same shareholder even if there is no \\"benefit\\" to the company giving the guarantee. Similarly, conceptually at least, there is no benefit to a company in returning profits to shareholders by way of dividend. However, the more pragmatic approach illustrated in the Australian case of Mills v. Mills normally prevails: > \\"[directors are] not required by the law to live in an unreal region of > detached altruism and to act in the vague mood of ideal abstraction from > obvious facts which [sic] must be present to the mind of any honest and > intelligent man when he exercises his powers as a director.\\" at p. 164 per > Latham CJ. *Hutton v. West Cork Railway Co (1883) 23 Ch D 654, per Bowen LJ, > \\"money which [sic] is not theirs but the company‚Äôs, if they are spending it > for the purposes which are reasonably incidental to the carrying on of the > business of the company. That is the general doctrine. Bona fides cannot be > the sole test, otherwise you might have a lunatic conducting the affairs of > the company, and paying away its money with both hands in a manner perfectly > bona fide yet perfectly irrational‚Ä¶ It is for the directors to judge, > provided it is a matter which is reasonably incidental to the carrying on of > the business of the company‚Ä¶ The law does not say that there are to be no > cakes and ale, but there are to be no cakes and ale except such as are > required for the benefit of the company.\\" *Boulting v Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians [1963] 2 QB 606 =Independent judgment= *s.173 Companies Act 2006 Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their discretion in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see Clark v. Workman [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and Dawson International plc v. Coats Paton plc 1989 SLT 655 This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director. This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract that binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the contract that the board previously approved). =Care and skill= Traditionally, the level of care and skill a director must demonstrate has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that: :\\"a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience.\\" (emphasis added) However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain. However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in Equitable Fire related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was: :\\"such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf.\\" This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level. More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new Companies Act 2006 have been codified on this basis.Norman v. Theodore Goddard [1991] BCLC 1027 *s.174, Companies Act 2006 *Re Barings plc (No.5) [1999] 1 BCLC 433 *Re D‚ÄôJan of London Ltd [1994] 1 BCLC 561 =Loyalty and conflicts of interest= Directors also owe strict duties not to permit any conflict of interest or conflict with their duty to act in the best interests of the company. This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 Lord Cranworth stated in his judgment that, > \\"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of > those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation > whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a > fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal > application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed > to enter into engagements in which he has, or can have, a personal interest > conflicting or which possibly may conflict, with the interests of those whom > he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no > question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the > contract entered into...\\" *s.175 Companies Act 2006 *Keech v Sandford (1726) Sel Cas. Ch.61 *Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver [1942] All ER 378 *Cook v Deeks [1916] 1 AC 554 *Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley [1972] *Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing [1989] BCLC 498 *In Plus Group Ltd v Pyke *Foster Bryant Surveying Ltd v Bryant [2007] EWCA Civ 200 *O'Donnell v Shanahan [2009] EWCA Civ 751 As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories. ;Transactions with the company By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In Aberdeen Ry v. BlaikieAberdeen Ry v. Blaikie (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 Lord Cranworth stated in his judgment that: > \\"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of > those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation > whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a > fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal > application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed > to enter into engagements in which he has, or can have, a personal interest > conflicting or which possibly may conflict, with the interests of those whom > he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no > question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the > contract entered into...\\" However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution. In many countries there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985 ;Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, opportunities, or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success. In Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a going concern. They formed a new company (\\"Company B\\") to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up share capital of not less than ¬£5,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than ¬£2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B - the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so. held that: :\\"(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves.\\" And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall. The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and Boardman v Phipps [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up) and is now regarded as settled law. ;Competing with the company Directors cannot, clearly, compete directly with the company without a conflict of interests arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other. *Hogg v. Cramphorn Ltd. [1967] Ch 254 =Remedies for breach of duty= As in most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties: # injunction or declaration # damages or compensation # restoration of the company's property # rescission of the relevant contract # account of profits # summary dismissal S 176 A Duty not to accept benefits from third parties. A director must not accept financial or non financial benefits from third parties.

Conservative Anglicans met in 2008 at the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON), creating the Jerusalem Declaration and establishing the FCA. Founding The Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON) was held near Jerusalem in June 2008 at the initiative of theologically conservative African, Asian, Australian, South American, North American and European Anglican leaders who opposed the ordination of homosexuals and the blessing of same-sex unions by member churches of the Anglican Communion. The meeting came as the culmination of a series of controversies in the Anglican Communion which began in 2003 when the openly non-celibate gay bishop Gene Robinson was consecrated by The Episcopal Church in the USA. GAFCON was organised as a conservative alternative to the 2008 Lambeth Conference which was boycotted by many traditionalists. The GAFCON Final Statement recognises the Archbishop of Canterbury for his historic role in the Anglican Church but denies that his recognition is the cornerstone of Anglican identity. The statement also called for the formation of \\"A Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans\\". The FCA was instrumental in the formation of the Anglican Church in North America in 2009. The ACNA was formed as an alternative church structure for those disaffected by the official Anglican structures in the USA and Canada. The Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America, which covers much of South America, is a key constituent of the FCA movement. The Anglican Diocese of Sydney, Australia played an important role in forming the FCA and its Archbishop Peter Jensen is the FCA's secretary. Organization The Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans aims to extend the goals of GAFCON into a movement, to \\"preach the biblical gospel ... all over the world\\" and \\"provide aid to ... faithful Anglicans\\" disaffected from their original churches. FCA recognizes the Jerusalem Declaration, written at the 2008 GAFCON meeting, as a \\"contemporary rule\\". The FCA is administered by a \\"Primates' Council\\" originally consisting of Primates from the African provinces of the Anglican Communion. By region * The FCA in the United Kingdom and Ireland was started on 6 July 2009, drawing together plenty but not all conservative Anglicans in the Church of England and other parts of the British Isles. The Free Church of England is also represented on the Steering Group. It has supported the Anglican Mission in England (AMiE), launched at the GAFCON II, as a safe haven for orthodox Anglicans inside and outside the Church of England structures. In 2015, Rod Thomas (a member of the executive of AMiE) was consecrated the provincial episcopal visitor for conservative evangelical members of the Church of England. * The FCA in South Africa was started on 3 September 2009 by the initiative of Bishop Bethlehem Nopece, of the Anglican Diocese of Port Elizabeth. It incorporates Anglicans from three denominations: the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, the Church of England in South Africa and the Traditional Anglican Communion. * The FCA in Australia was started on 26 March 2015 in Melbourne, in a conference that reunited 460 members, including 40 from New Zealand, attended by Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, from the Anglican Church of Kenya, chairman of the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans, Archbishop Stanley Ntagali, from the Anglican Church of Uganda, and Archbishop Glenn Davies, from the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. Archdeacon Richard Condie, from the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne became the Chairman of FCA Australia. * The FCA in New Zealand was started on April 2016 in two conferences that took place in Auckland and Christchurch reuniting nearly 500 members from the entire country. The FCA of New Zealand is the local expression of the GAFCON, whose chairman, Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, from Kenya, sent a message of support read at the conferences. Video greetings were also sent by Archbishop Foley Beach, of the Anglican Church in North America, and Bishop Richard Condie, of the Anglican Diocese of Tasmania and chairman of the FCA Australia. Rev. Jay Behan became the chair of the FCA New Zealand. The creation of the FCA New Zealand was a result of the passing of Motion 30 by the Anglican Church of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia and the subsequent document \\"A Way Forward\\", proposing the blessing of same-sex marriages, presented at their General Synod in May 2014.Formation of Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans New Zealand, Anglican Mainstream, 19 April 2016 The Church of Confessing Anglicans of Aotearoa/New Zealand was established in 2019 with Behan as the inaugural bishop.

His mother encouraged him to travel to Manu'a and begin a new life on the frontier. Once there he took to wife the daughter of Tuimanu'a and was for a time even granted the title of Tuimanu'a for educating the locals on taro cultivation and cooking,Dr. Augustin Kraemer, The Samoa Islands: Material Culture, University of Hawai'i Press, 1994. P. 196. but he grew dissatisfied and relocated to Tutuila. Other Samoan accounts tell of how Pili dishonorably took liberties with the daughter of Tuimanu'a, a young maiden named Sina- sa'umani. This is the origin of the story of Hina and the Eel, and Sina and the Eel. In these versions it is Tuimanu'a's wrath over Sina's violated maidenhead that drives Pili to flee from Manu'a. It was in Tutuila that he first took refuge,Rev. George Turner, Samoa, a Hundred Years Ago and Long Before: Together with Notes on the Cults and Customs of Twenty-three Other Islands in the Pacific, Macmillan, 1884. p. 233. and where he acquired the Tuitele title,C. Stuebel and Bro. Herman, Tala o le Vavau, Polynesian Press, 1987. pp. 20, 22. but again grew discontent with the chiefs there who appointed him and later mocked his lack of skill in fishing, so onward he traveled to Upolu. On Upolu he took as wife the daughter of Tui-a-Ana. Now, most Samoan lore agrees that Pili's sons were in order of birth Tua (founder of Atua), Ana (founder of Aana), Saga (founder of Tua-ma-Saga), and Tolufale (founder of Manono and Sapapalii). This suggests that Pili may have taken to wife his own granddaughter, not unlike the custom of Egyptian pharaohs. Again, Pili grew dissatisfied with the Tui-a-ana's demands for fishMisilugi Tulifau Tofaeono Tu'u'u, History of Samoa Islands: Supremacy & Legacy of the Malietoa (na Fa'alogo i Ai Samoa), Tuga'ula, 2002. pp. 31-33. instead of taro (likely a metaphor for conquest), and Pili commissioned a fleet of canoes that he uses to great effect, using a net to extract a mind-boggling haul to the amazement of Tui-a-ana and his chiefs. Samoan lore at this point recounts Pili's departure for Aopo where he established a vast plantation, became king, had many descendants, and later died. It is in this window of the narrative that he likely found sojourn in Hawai'i at the behest of po'o-kahuna Pa'ao and established the Pili line there.Stephenson Percy Smith, Hawaiki: The Original Home of the Maori: with a sketch of Polynesian History, Whitcombe and Tombs, Limited, 1904. p. 170.

Certain offences are punishable by sentences of up to two years in prison. In March 2008, police and the Malta Ministry for Social Policy signed a memorandum of understanding to formalize a screening process for all arrested persons engaged in prostitution to determine whether they were victims of trafficking or other abuses. The law provides punishments of up to 6 years for involving minors in prostitution. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat promised to discuss legalising prostitution in the buildup to the 2017 general election. Valletta‚Äôs Strait Street, known locally as the 'Gut', was the centre of prostitution from the 1830s to the 1970s. The Mello area of G≈ºira is known as a red-light district. History =Knights of Malta= Prostitution has occurred in Malta for centuries. When the Knights Hospitaller came to the country in 1530, the port of Vittoriosa contained many brothels. As well as Maltese prostitutes, there were also some from Greece, Italy, Spain and North Africa. The French king's geographer, Nicholas de Nicolai, was impressed by the number of prostitutes in the streets when he visited Vittoriosa in 1551, Prior to the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, arrangements were made to evacuate the country's prostitutes to Sicily. When the Knights moved from Vittoriosa to the new capital Valletta, the prostitutes followed. As the Knights took vows of chastity, the prostitutes with them was seen as a scandal. Foreign prostitutes were expelled and the Maltese prostitutes confined to one area of the city. At the time prostitutes wore a white shirt tied under their bust and a white cape. In 1608, inquisitor Leonetto della Cordoba was charged with seeking out prostitutes and dismissed as an inquisitor. Prostitution was also common on Gozo. Towards the 17th century, there was harsh prejudice and laws towards those who were found guilty or who spoke openly of being involved in same-sex activity. English voyager and author William Lithgow, writing in March 1616, says a Spanish soldier and a Maltese teenage boy were publicly burnt to ashes for confessing to have practiced sodomy together. Fearing a similar end, about a hundred males involved in same-sex prostitution sailed to Sicily the following day. Under a code introduced by Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena in 1724, married men of means were fined if found guilty of use of the service of a prostitute, and expelled from the country on the third conviction. Lower-class men were whipped and sentenced to hard labour on the third offence. The 1784 code of Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc barred foreign prostitutes from entering the country and placed restrictions on Maltese prostitutes. They were not allowed to open their doors between sunrise and sunset and were not allowed to enter pubs or taverns. Compulsory medical examinations were introduced. =French period= Auberge de Bavi√®re was a hospital for venereal disease in Valletta Following the French occupation of Malta, prostitution rose. Compulsory medical examinations continued and the authorities opened hospitals in the monastery of Saint Scholastica and in Auberge de Bavi√®re to treat soldiers with STIs. =British period= After the country came under control of the British, prostitution increased again due to the number of sailors and soldiers stationed there. Many married women worked as prostitutes, with their husbands' knowledge, due to economic hardship. Strait Street, in Valletta known locally as the 'Gut', was the centre of prostitution from the 1830s to the 1970s. Compulsory medical examinations continued until 1859 when it was realised that previous Grand Master codes were not legally enforceable. The prostitutes therefore refused to undergo the examinations. As a result, the authorities, under the guidance of Governor John Le Marchant, decreed under Ordinance IV of 1861, that all prostitutes should be examined by a police doctor three times a month in an attempt to control the spread of STDs. If an infection was discovered, the prostitute was taken to hospital and kept there until cured. This regulation in Malta was a great influence on Britain introducing the first of the Contagious Diseases Acts in 1864 and its subsequent extension. The frequency of examinations was increased to 4 times a month in 1920. Although there were regulations to control STIs, there were no prostitution laws until 1898. A new law was introduced prohibiting brothels, and not more than one prostitute could live in the same house unless they registered with the police. The law also forbade prostitutes to live on the ground floor, within 50 yards of a place of worship or adjacent to licensed premises. In 1904 there were 152 registered prostitutes, although many more were unregistered. Malta was known by British sailors as the 'place with the three Ps: pubs, priests and prostitutes'. Under the British Maltese moved to Egypt and Soho in London from 1905 to set up brothels there. Sex trafficking Malta is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from Malta have also been subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Women from Southeast Asia working as domestic workers, Chinese nationals working in massage parlors, and women from Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine working in nightclubs represent populations vulnerable to exploitation. Article 248A-G of the criminal code prohibits both sex and labour trafficking and prescribes penalties of four to 12 years imprisonment. The government has not obtained a conviction since early 2012. The government conducted three investigations and initiated prosecution of four defendants in one case, which remained pending at the close of 2016. These efforts were on par with 2015 when the government initiated investigation of two cases and prosecution of two defendants. Both the appeal of a 2012 conviction of a police officer for alleged collusion with a trafficker, and the prosecution of a 2004 case involving a police official, remained pending. There were no new investigations or prosecutions of government employees complicit in human trafficking offences. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Malta as a 'Tier 2' country.

The C-class blimp operated by the United States Navy after the war was a completely unrelated design. In total 35 Coastals were built, all at RNAS Kingsnorth, Kent. Entering service in 1916, the Coastal class remained in widespread service until 1918, with a few members of the class still in service at the signing of the Armistice, while others were replaced by the improved C-Star class as they became unfit for service. The blimps were used for long anti-submarine patrols in the Western Approaches and English Channel, protecting convoys from German U-Boats. The Coastal class was one of the first aircraft types specifically designed to detect and attack submarines.London, 1999. History and design The C-Class was far from a new design. The prototype was built in 1915 by using the envelope from the No. 10 Astra-Torres airship, and a gondola built using the front-sections of two Avro seaplane fuselages joined together back-to-back to provide one tractor- and one pusher propeller. The envelope was composed of rubber-proofed fabric that was also doped to hold the gas and resist the effects of weather, and had a distinctive trilobe shape in which the two lower lobes were situated side-by-side, and the third was positioned centrally above them.London, 1999, p. 12.Coastal Class The Airship Heritage Trust. Retrieved on 14 March 2009. Gondola of C.23A Sometimes referred to as the \\"ugliest\\" dirigibles ever made, production Coastals looked very similar, but used a bespoke gondola with canvas sides built over a wooden frame. The trilobe envelope allowed the gondola to be hung closer to the envelope, reducing the overall height of the aircraft and slightly reducing head resistance. Four ballonets, two in each of the two lower lobes, were used to maintain the envelope's shape and pressure.London, 1999, p. 13. These were kept inflated by a metal air scoop mounted in the slipstream of the forward propeller on earlier examples, and at the rear propeller on later versions. The nose of the envelope was made of aluminium sheet reinforced with bamboo canes to prevent it deforming due to the airflow pressure as the airship moved. Three tailfins were used. The two upper ones were mounted in a shallow V-tail configuration and carried the elevators, while the single vertical fin below the envelope incorporated a rudder. Ten main suspensions were incorporated in the Coastal envelope, of which seven supported the weight of the gondola, and the remaining three took the guys that allowed the 196 ft (60 m)-long airships to be handled on the ground. No landing gear was fitted, apart from two wooden skids at either end of the gondola which also protected the propellers. Various engines were used on the Coastal class. The most common configuration was two water-cooled Sunbeam engines, producing 150 hp (111 kW) each. Some replaced the aft unit with a Renault engine of 220 hp (164 kW), and various airships were deployed with a 100 hp (74 kW) Berliet engine in the front position. The former change was usually an attempt to improve the Coastals' leisurely top speed, whilst the latter was an attempt to improve reliability over the Sunbeam units, which had short lives when required to run at full speed for hours at a time in the long patrols undertaken by the airships.London, 1999, pp. 13‚Äì15. A 1.5 horsepower (1.1 kW) ABC engine was mounted in the gondola. This drove a dynamo to power the radio and, if needed, an auxiliary ballonet blower. The standard layout was to carry two 110-gallon (500 litre) fuel tanks, one per engine. These were usually mounted within the gondola, but when using the non-standard engines, the tanks would sometimes have to be relocated to outside the gondola or even hung from the rigging. Other equipment carried in the gondola included the compressed-air tanks for the engine starters, the engine oil tanks and the sandbag ballast.London, 1999, pp. 14‚Äì applies to all information on gondola specification and armaments. There was no standard armament for the class. The most usual set-up consisted of at least two .303 Lewis guns. These could be mounted in a variety of places around the gondola. Another Lewis Gun was mounted on a Scarff ring on the top of the envelope to provide a token defence from attacking aircraft. This position was accessed by climbing up a light wooden- or rope ladder inside a tube running up inside the envelope. Some C-Class commanders fitted additional Lewis guns to the bottom of the gondola to provide added firepower against submarines. Firing these required the crew to lean out of their cockpits or even stand on the landing skid to operate the weapon. The main anti-submarine armament was bombs. Most patrols carried four 100 or 112-lb (45 or 50 kg) bombs, but these could be replaced with a pair of 230-lb (104 kg) bombs or depth charges. The standard British Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle was often carried by one of the crew to destroy any mines found. A plate camera could be carried, usually used for surveys to prepare nautical charts. The standard crew was five: a pilot, a coxswain, an observer, a radio operator and a mechanic. Performance The design of the C-Class was unsophisticated. The type was unstable, with poor control authority. The responsiveness in the controls was sluggish and often caused the crew to be airsick. However one of the main advances in airship technology was the very high rate of climb which the coastals managed to provide. It had a top speed of around 40 knots (75 km/h), making it vulnerable to enemy aircraft and even surface ships. Even at these modest speeds, and despite its strengthening ribs, the nose of the airship was prone to denting, further compromising handling. The engines were prone to failure, regardless of the type used. This was mainly due to the extended duration of the patrols, which could reach 20 hours in length. The engines were run at virtually full speed all this time, leading to many units simply wearing out, and RNAS station maintenance crews became skilled at rapidly overhauling the engines. Other problems stemmed from the engine's magnetos. Before the war, the majority of magnetos used worldwide had been made in Germany, usually by Bosch and AEG; but the British-made Lucas replacements were of poorer quality and it was common for crews to carry several spares on patrol and many became adept at changing them in mid- flight.London, 1999, p. 15. The open, unheated cockpits of the Coastals were uncomfortable; some crew members resorted to walking around the outside of the gondola on the grab-handles to stretch their legs. In winter crews were at risk from frostbite and hypothermia. Often ground staff had to lift crewmen from their cockpit, they being unable to help themselves.London, 1999, p. 22. Shortly after entering service, the ballonet air-scoop was relocated from behind the front propeller to behind the rear propeller. This not only improved the efficiency of the system, but greatly improved the visibility from the front cockpits, making the difficult task of landing the airships slightly easier. Despite these flaws, the C-Class was the only aircraft available that could mount the long patrols needed to keep the Western Approaches and carry a useful bomb load in the hope of destroying a U-Boat.London, 1999, p. 4. Operations To maximise the amount of daylight for patrols, takeoffs would be made before dawn and landings would take place in darkness at night. RNAS stations were not equipped with floodlights or marker lights, and most landings were made in near-total darkness, with only hurricane lanterns held by the ground crew providing basic illumination. Later C-Class airships had a hatch in the floor of the gondola to allow a flare to be fired downwards to light up the landing ground. The RNAS provided a standard ration pack for each crew member for the flight. This was usually little more than some salted bacon or a sandwich, some Cadbury's chocolate and a flask of tea.London, 1999, p. 21. The airships carried no mechanical method of detecting submarines. On war patrols, crews had to rely on their own eyesight to find a U-Boat, but in 1918 experiments were carried out to develop a buoy carrying a basic ASDIC set that would be trailed below the craft;London, 1999, p. 43. however, the war ended before this project was completed. If the sea was calm, it was sometimes possible to make out the wake of a submerged submarine's periscope poking above the surface, or even the faint outline of the submarine itself if it was running just below the surface. The more reliable method was to search for a light oil slick on the surface coming from the various external bearings on the submarine. The airship crew would follow this trail until they reached the end of the slick, where it could be assumed the U-Boat was. Most encounters started with the submarine on the surface. Even if the airship crew sighted the submarine, the enemy crew were just as likely to sight the slowly approaching airship, dive and so have a good chance of escape. When airships escorted convoys, it was more effective to shadow the convoy and wait for the submarine to attack. The release of air when a torpedo was fired and the weapon's wake would betray the submarine's position. The overall offensive capabilities of the C-Class was weak ‚Äì in total, only six U-Boats were confirmed sunk by the 35-strong class during World War I. However, they had a great deterrent value. The type allowed the RNAS to operate a continuous air presence in the Western Approaches and English Channel. U-Boat commanders were wary of the British airships and many chose to operate only outside the main shipping lanes, which greatly decreased the risk to convoys. Throughout 1918 not a single convoy ship was lost to U-Boat action whilst the convoy was being protected by an RNAS airship. The C-Class, and other RNAS airship classes, also contributed to the sinking of several U-Boats by surface ships, being able to track a submarine's course and guide a destroyer or armed trawler to its position.London, 1999, p. 34. Even if the airships attacked a target but failed to damage it, the submarine would often abort an attack once the commander knew an airship was on hand. Similarly, airship crews soon realised that after an attack a submarine commander would often surface to confirm his \\"kill\\", and to allow his boat to exit the area at maximum speed. Airships simply had to hover over the site of the attack and wait for the U-Boat to come to the surface.London, 1999, p. 24. The sluggish performance of the Coastal class made them vulnerable to enemy aircraft. The RNAS was careful to keep its airships away from the central and eastern parts of the English Channel, which were in range of German bombers and some fighters. On the rare aerial encounters that occurred, the airship crew's tactic was to run for the nearest coast, where anti-aircraft guns could drive away the attackers. It was difficult to physically destroy the blimps ‚Äì bullets could knock out the engines, which would simply cause the airship to drift; or puncture the envelope, which would cause the craft to slowly settle to the ground. German fighter aircraft posed the greatest threat as their tracer ammunition could ignite the hydrogen in the envelope. The gunner manning the gun position at the top of the envelope was especially vulnerable, being directly in an attacker's line of fire and sitting atop a large, slow-moving bag of hydrogen. Many airship crews decided that the upper gun was ineffective, and moved it down onto the gondola to provide further offensive power. Towards the end of 1917, many of these ships were in need of a complete refit having been in commission for over two years. Initially several were put in order, but it was later decided instead to replace each ship as it became no longer fit to fly by the more modern Coastal type known as the C-Star (C*) -class. These had a larger envelope with a capacity of containing six ballonets of in total for an increased useful lift of ; had a greater fuel capacity, a top speed of , and had a service ceiling of .Coastal * class airship specifications The Airship Heritage Trust.

In July 1917 C-24 set a new world record for airborne endurance when she mounted a patrol that lasted for 24 hours, 15 minutes. A total of 45 standard Coastals and C-Stars were built. Twelve were totally destroyed in one way or another, but only two were lost to enemy action in the entire war, and just four survived to the Armistice.

A pitcher, he appeared in 15 games, including ten starts, in Major League Baseball for the Kansas City Royals in and . As a rookie with the 1979 Royals, Chamberlain threw three complete game victories in his first three Major League appearances. Chamberlain was drafted in the first round of the secondary phase of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft after attending Long Beach City College and the University of Arizona. The , right-hander made his professional debut in 1979 at the Double-A level and won 12 of 21 decisions, with 11 complete games and a sparkling 2.59 earned run average. In August 1979, the Royals summoned him to the Major Leagues and he made his first start on August 12. Three straight complete game wins kicked off MLB career The Royals were then locked in a race for the American League West Division championship, in third place and five games behind the California Angels. In a game against the Detroit Tigers at Royals Stadium, Whitey Herzog, the Kansas City manager, handed the ball to the 22-year-old Chamberlain and gave him the starting assignment in his MLB debut. Chamberlain proceeded to allow only six hits, five of them singles, in a 7‚Äì1 triumph, walking two and striking out six. Five days later, at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore against the Orioles, Chamberlain again got the starting nod and again notched a complete game, 7‚Äì1 win. This time, he allowed only three hits (including a home run by Ken Singleton) and two walks to the eventual American League champions, defeating Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer. In his third start, on August 24 at home against the Boston Red Sox, Chamberlain was not as effective, allowing ten hits and two earned runs, but he defeated Boston 4‚Äì2 and, in the process, bested another future Hall of Famer, Dennis Eckersley, who was then a starting pitcher. Starting pitcher during Royals' 1979 stretch run His winning streak ended four days later, on August 28 against the visiting Milwaukee Brewers. He went only five innings, allowing seven hits (including two home runs) and four earned runs, and took the loss in an 11‚Äì6 Milwaukee victory. After a no-decision in his fifth start, against New York at Yankee Stadium, Chamberlain notched his fourth complete game win in his sixth start September 7 at the Kingdome in an eight-hit, 6‚Äì2 win over the Seattle Mariners. It would be his last MLB victory and complete game. Chamberlain continued to take a turn in the Kansas City rotation during September 1979 but lost his last three decisions, to finish 4‚Äì4 with a 3.75 earned run average in ten starts and 69 innings pitched during his rookie campaign. The Royals finished three games behind the Angels in second place in the AL West. In 1980, the Royals would break through to recapture the division title and win their first American League pennant, but Chamberlain spent the season at Triple-A, winning 11 games but compiling an ineffective 4.76 earned run average with the Omaha Royals. He was recalled in September and made five appearances in relief, but lost his only decision and allowed ten hits and five walks in 9 innings pitched. It was his last MLB trial. His professional career, however, continued over the next 15 seasons, in the minor leagues (1981‚Äì1983; 1987‚Äì1988; 1991) and independent league baseball (1995). As a Major Leaguer, he pitched in 15 games and 79 innings, allowing 78 hits and 23 walks, with 33 strikeouts.

As Chief of the General Staff, Pollard oversaw the restructure of the Australian Army along pentropic lines. The Pentropic organisation was a military organisation used by the Australian Army between 1960 and 1965. It was based on the United States Army's pentomic organisation and involved reorganising most of the Army's combat units into units based on five elements, rather than the previous three or four sub-elements. The organisation proved unsuccessful, and the Army reverted to its previous unit structures in early 1965. History The decision to adopt the Pentropic organisation was driven by a desire to modernise the Army and ensure that Australian units were able to integrate with those of the United States Army. While the US Pentomic organisation had been implemented in 1957 to improve the Army's ability to operate during a nuclear war, the Australian organisation was optimised for limited wars in South East Asia in which there was a chance that nuclear weapons might be used. Both structures were designed to facilitate independent operations by the sub-units of divisions. The Australian Pentropic division was intended to be air portable, capable of fighting in a limited war and capable of conducting anti-guerrilla operations.Kuring 2004, pp. 261‚Äì262. The key element of the Pentropic organisation was the reorganisation of divisions into five combined arms battle groups. These battle groups consisted of an infantry battalion, field artillery regiment, engineer field squadron and other combat and logistic elements, including armoured, aviation and armoured personnel carrier units as required. These battle groups would be commanded by the commanding officer of their infantry battalion and report directly to the headquarters of the division as brigade headquarters were abolished as part of the reorganisation.Kuring 2004, pp. 263‚Äì264. When the Pentropic organisation was implemented in 1960 the Australian Army was reorganised from three divisions organised on what was called the Tropical establishment (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd divisions) into two Pentropic divisions (the 1st and 3rd). While two of the Army's three regular infantry battalions were expanded into the new large Pentropic battalions, the 30 reserve Citizens Military Force (CMF) battalions were merged into just nine battalions.Kuring 2004, p. 265. This excluded the University Regiments and the Papua New Guinea Volunteer Rifles which remained unchanged.Blaxland 1989, p.83. There was a similar effect on the other CMF units, with most being merged into new, larger units. The other regular infantry battalion remained on the previous tropical establishment as it formed part of the 28th Commonwealth Brigade in Malaysia. As part of this reorganisation the Army replaced its outdated weapons with more modern weapons, most of which were supplied from the United States. It was believed that these new weapons would further improve the Army's combat power and the ability of sub-units to operate independently. The Pentropic organisation was trialled during exercises in 1962 and 1963. These exercises revealed that the battle groups' command and control arrangements were unsatisfactory, as battalion headquarters were too small to command such large units in combat situations. While the large Pentropic infantry battalions were found to have some operational advantages over the old tropical establishment battalions, the divisions' large number of vehicles resulted in traffic jams when operating in tropical conditions. John Wilton in Morotai, September 1945. As Chief of the General Staff, Wilton later commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation.Grey, The Australian Army, p. 209 The experience gained from exercises and changes in Australia's strategic environment led to the decision to move away from the Pentropic organisation in 1964. During the early 1960s a number of small counter- insurgency wars broke out in South East Asia, and the large Pentropic infantry battalions were ill-suited to these sorts of operations. As the US Army had abandoned its pentomic structure in 1962 and the British Army remained on the tropical establishment, the Australian Army was unable to provide forces which were suited for the forms of warfare it was likely to experience or which were organised along the same lines as units from Australia's main allies. In addition, concentrating the Army's limited manpower into a small number of large battalions was found to be undesirable as it reduced the number of deployable units in the Army. As a result of these factors the Australian Government decided to return the Army to the tropical establishment in November 1964 as part of a wide-ranging package of reforms to the Australian military, which included increasing the size of the Army. The Army returned to the tropical establishment in 1965, and many of the CMF battalions were re- established as independent units.

Luther Alexander Gotwald, D.D., c.1890Luther Alexander Gotwald, D.D. (1833‚Äì1900) was a professor of theology in the Wittenberg Theological Seminary in the United States. He was tried for heresy by the board of directors at Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio, on April 4 and 5, 1893, which put on trial many key issues that Lutherans still debate today. Gotwald died in 1900 in Springfield, Ohio. Family Daniel Gotwald (1793-1843), Father of Luther Gotwald Gotwald was born in York Springs, Adams County, Pennsylvania, on January 31, 1833, the fifth child of seven brothers and five sisters. His parents were Lutheran minister Daniel Gotwald and his wife, Susannah (Krone) Gotwald, both natives of Pennsylvania and of German ancestry. The elder Gotwald was a prominent minister of the Lutheran Church and reportedly was \\"one of the most able and eloquent Lutheran ministers of his time\\". Daniel Gotwald was born in Manchester Township, York County, Pennsylvania, on December 16, 1793. Daniel's German immigrant parents were Andrew and Mary Magdalene Gottwald. Daniel was christened January 26, 1794 in Quickel's Church, Conewago Township, Pennsylvania. Daniel and Susannah were married on July 22, 1819, in York, Pennsylvania by John George Schmucker, the then forty- eight-year-old pastor of Christ Lutheran Church of York, and the father of famous Lutheran theologian and educator, Samuel Simon Schmucker.Rev. John George Schmucker, 48 years of age, was pastor of Christ Lutheran Church, York. He had not yet received his D. D. degree. His twenty-year-old son Simon had served temporarily as teacher at the York Academy having studied theology at home with his father and then having gone off to Princeton for formal theological training. The elder Schmucker was born in Michelstadt, Germany, of pious parents who emigrated to America in 1785. He studied theology under Lutheran pastors of his day and was admitted as a member of the Pennsylvania Synod in 1794. About this time, John Schmucker was an advocate of the proposed General Synod, a federation of Lutheran synods in America which came into being in 1820. J-2: pp. 682-684; W-4: pp. 9, 13, 16f. Daniel lived in York, where he worked as a carpenter, until the birth of his third child. In time, Daniel came to see himself as a very sinful man who was in great peril of \\"eternal death\\". Samuel Simon Schmucker Daniel began preaching on his own, drawing surprisingly large crowds. However, Rev. John George Schmucher approached Daniel and convinced him that he needed a formal education in Lutheranism. For a year and a half, Daniel walked every week through the very thick Penn's Woods to York to recite to the elder Schmucker. However, in time, this manner of instruction only whetted his taste for an even better education in the Lutheran ministry, so he sold his home and moved his family to Gettysburg to begin his full and regular course of theological study in the Lutheran Theological Seminary there as preparation for his work in the ministry. He studied there for two and a half years under the seminary's founder,. Samuel Simon Schmucker, who later said Daniel was \\"one of the most diligent and successful students that the Seminary ever had.\\"Luther A. Gotwald, An Autobiography, p.22. In 1826 Samuel Simon Schmucker organized the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg and was its first professor. Since Daniel Gottwald entered the ministry in 1830, having studied two and one half years at Gettysburg, this places him among the first students to graduate from that school. Born on February 28, 1799, Schmucker, the son of the pastor who married Daniel Gotwald and Sussanah Krone, had received his theological training at Princeton Seminary, a Presbyterian school. Six years younger than Daniel Gottwald, this young professor, was, at this point in his life, the best educated Lutheran in America, and when compared to others of his day, was a conservative Lutheran, seeking to establish a seminary when as lately as eight years earlier (1818) the Pennsylvania Ministerium had named a committee of his father, Conrad Jaeger and H. A. Muhlenberg to plan a Union Seminary with the reformed branch of Protestantism. Schmucker also had served a pastorate in Shenandoah County, Virginia. Read A. R. Wentz's Pioneer in Christian Unity‚ÄìSamuel Simon Schmucker for a sympathetic approach to the enigmatic personality known as S. S. Schmucker. W-4, B-1: p. 106. Daniel Gotwald was among the first to graduate from Gettysburg Seminary. Daniel had two pastorates, one in Adams County and one in Centre County, Pennsylvania. His pastorate in Centre County served sixteen churches, one being over away, which required him to be on the road much of the time.Prepared Under the Editorial Supervision of Dr. Benjamin F. Prince, President Clark County Historical Society, A Standard History of Springfield and Clark County, Ohio: An Authentic Narrative of the Past, with Particular Attention to the Modern Era in the Commercial, Industrial, Educational, Civic and Social Development, Volume II, published by the American Historical Society, Chicago and New York, 1922, p.358. Daniel ardently supported the abolition of slavery in his ministry. Moreover, he fervently espoused the cause of temperance, which caused some to accuse him of being a \\"Methodist\\". Luther Gotwald gives this further description of his father's imposing physical characteristics, which undoubtedly served him well in his ministry: Luther's father always preached in German, never in English. Luther Gotwald reported, in his own autobiography, as to his father's German language preaching that \\"As an orator and preacher he possessed great power. His voice was one of remarkable compass and sweetness. His thoughts logical and good, his imagination fine, his gestures graceful and wonderfully expressive, and his manner all earnestness, pathos, fire; his own soul all alive with the truth he was uttering, and his auditors held spell bound and weeping under his moving exaltations of truth and his powerful appeals.\\"Luther A. Gotwald, An Autobiography, p.25. The elder Gotwald had a fiery temper, which his son, Luther said often caused his father great embarrassment and remorse. However, Luther went on to give this amusing account of the effect of his father's equally fiery eloquence in the pulpit, albeit in German. Luther's mother, Susannah Krone Gotwald, was a devout lady who taught her children her own deep piety and her own stern virtues. His mother could not read English, but read her German bible every day.Luther Alexander Gotwald, Jr., The Gotwald Trial Revisited, Davidsville, Pennsylvania, 1992, p.78.

Four of their children died in childhood. George Gotwald, died at Liverpool, Pennsylvania at the age of two. Sarah Anna Gotwald died at Liverpool at the age of eleven months. Leah Gotwald died June 7, 1826, at Liverpool October 10, 1823 at the age of six days. Mary Catherine Gotwald died at Aaronsburg on May 20, 1842, at the age of seven. Luther's father died on March 11, 1843, in Aaronsburg at the age of 49, after an illness of some three months. He was buried in the Evangelical Lutheran Church yard at Aaronsburg. Daniel Gotwald's death left his wife of twenty-five years, Susannah, with their eight surviving children to bring up and with meager financial means to do it. He left her with only a modest home and a few acres of land. Luther's older sister, Eliza Gotwald, married Jacob Scherer of Aaronsburg in May 1845, when Luther was eleven years old. Scherer became the second Lutheran minister in the state of Illinois. He was born in Botetourt County, Virginia. He graduated from Pennsylvania College in 1841 as the valedictorian of his class and two years later from Gettysburg Seminary. He served his first pastorate at Indianapolis, Indiana from 1843 until 1845. Scherer then had ministries at Wabash County, Illinois, at Olney, Illinois and at Shelbyville, Illinois. He, with six other ministers, organized the Lutheran Synod of South West Virginia on September 20, 1841, at St. John's Church, Wythe County, Virginia. Scherer died near Shelbyville, Illinois, on October 15, 1851, while Luther was living as a guest in his home shortly before he left for Springfield, Ohio to begin his studies at Wittenberg College. Eliza remarried a man with the same name as her later first husband, Jacob Scherer. He was actually a distant relative of her first husband. Perhaps predictably, there was no way this second husband could come up to her first one in Luther's estimation. To begin with, he was a farmer and not a clergyman. Luther describes him as \\"a kind husband, but a man of little culture and no energy.\\"Gotwald Autobiography, p. 20. Eliza died in Hillsboro, Illinois, at the age of 41 on September 25, 1855. Luther said of her, \\"Eliza was a noble Christian women, a dutiful daughter, a kind sister, an affectionate wife, a loving mother, and a patient and self-denying Christian, willing to suffer the loss of all things.\\" Luther's brother George Andrew Gotwald was a practicing physician in Slaterford, Pennsylvania. However, Luther still considered him to be the black sheep of the family. He reports that \\"For many years he was no Christian.\\" But then, Luther continues with great relief that \\"when forty one years of age, he professed to give his heart to God, and has ever since lived a consistent Christian life.\\" Luther attributes this great miracle to his \\"pious mother\\", who prayed every day for forty years for that conversion and her son's resultant salvation. George was married to Miss Lizzie Rolinsen, of New Harmony, Posey County, Indiana, whom Luther pronounced to be \\"an excellent Christian woman\\".Gotwald Autobiography, p. 21. Strangely, Luther does not seem to have known much about his older brother, Daniel Isaac Gotwald. He was a printer who died in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1849 when he was 21. Luther says of him that \\"He was, I think, noble and upright in all his deportment, respectful and happy in his disposition, and a genial favorite among all who knew him. At the time of his death, several of the Cincinnati papers spoke very favorably of him.\\" Luther admits that he does not even know whether Daniel Isaac was a Christian but continued that \\"Fervently do I hope that he was, for it is a dreadful thought that any of those we love, and especially one so dear as a Brother, should be called unprepared, from time into eternity, there to suffer forever for the misdeeds of this life.\\"Gotwald Autobiography, p. 23. Luther's brother, Washington Van Buren Gotwald Gotwald's brother, Washington Van Buren Gotwald, was a Lutheran minister in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He attended Pennsylvania College, from which he graduated in 1860. He served for one year as tutor in the Preparatory Department at Gettysburg. He was a member of the Philo Literary Society and of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. After a two-year course in the theological seminary, he was ordained by the Pennsylvania Synod at its meeting in 1862 at Reading. He served first for four years as minister at Emmitsburg, Maryland. In 1866, he became the minister of St. John's Lutheran Church at Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His work in both of these ministries was widely praised. He died at Lancaster on June 10, 1869. Luther's younger brother, William Henry Harrison Gotwald, also became a Lutheran minister. His wife was Annie C. Murray. He attended the public school during the winter and worked on a farm during the summer until he was eighteen. He attended the Aaronsburg Academy and prepared himself for college. He entered Pennsylvania College in 1861, but his education was interrupted by the Civil War. After the Civil War, he re- enrolled in Pennsylvania College and graduated from there in 1866. In the fall of that year, he became principal of the Aaronsburg Academy and continued as its principal for two years. Luther proudly notes that \\"It was during his Principalship that this Academy had a larger number of students in attendance than at any other time either before or since.\\"Gotwald Autobiography, P. 177. William Henry Harrison Gotwald was ordained in the Lutheran ministry in 1868. His first ministry was at Loganton, Pennsylvania, which had been a part of his father's last charge. During his career in the Lutheran ministry, he served several churches and held a variety of offices in the Lutheran Church. In April 1873 became pastor to the Lutheran Church at Milton, Pennsylvania and continued as its pastor for nearly fifteen years, when he had to resign due to bronchial troubles. While he was serving as pastor at Milton, he was also president of the Susquehanna Synod for three years and chairman of the Examining Committee for many years. He served as a member of the Milton School Board for twelve years, being its president for three years. He was the originator and organizer of the Pennsylvania State School Directors' Association and was its president for three years. He was a delegate to the General Synod and director of the Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. He served as a Presbyterian minister in Ocala, Florida, where he had gone due to his health. However, he built a Lutheran church at Martin, Florida. He organized the St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Washington, D. C. and served as its pastor until June 1897. He died on March 12, 1921. Luther's younger brother, Jacob Henry Gotwald, was a respected surgeon, who died at sea close to Charleston, South Carolina at the age of 24 during the Civil War (discussed below). Susan Crone Gotwald, who survived her husband by 44 years, died in her sleep on July 17, 1881, in Aaronsburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania. Susanna (Krone) Gotwald (1801-1881), Mother of Rev. Luther Gotwald Gotwald said this of his mother in his autobiography. Early life and education The parsonage where Luther Gotwald was born, Petersburg (York Springs), Pa. Luther Alexander Gotwald was baptized by Samuel Simon Schmucker, who was a great friend of his father and who had come to Petersburg to assist his father at a communion season. He lived most of his younger days in Petersburg, now Littlestown, Pennsylvania. Gotwald said this of his native town of Petersburg in his autobiography: Gotwald undertook his early studies at an academy near his home of which, as an adult, he admitted to remembering little. At the age of ten, he went to work as a clerk and errand boy in various stores to help support his family. He also worked as a carpenter and a carriage maker. However, Luther later wrote, \\"my desires for further education prevented me from so concentrating my mind at these trades as to make a success of them. I remember keeping books in the drawer of my work bench and at every spare moment, I would take occasion to read from them. In fact, my employer said that my mind was so set on the books that I managed to spoil more lumber than I was worth and I was discharged.\\"Luther A. Gotwald, An Autobiography, p. 53. His sister, Eliza lived \\"out west\\", so he decided to follow her. Of this move, he reports. David Jr., Sara Jane, Mary Elizabeth and Robert Quigley King in their eighties In the spring of 1851 and at the age of 19, Luther Gotwald entered Wittenberg College, a Lutheran college in Springfield, Ohio, in the Preparatory Department. He only had fourteen dollars when he arrived and he had to work to pay his way.Gotwald, p. 53 He remained at Wittenberg until his sophomore year. There is a book written by his Lutheran cleric great-grandson, Luther A. Gotwald, Jr, entitled The Gotwald Trial Revisited (the \\"Gotwald heresy trial book\\" for short). The book states that Gotwald took up with college sweetheart Mary Elizabeth King, who was fifteen years old at the time. Gotwald met King through her brothers. She had three brothers, David King, Jr., Robert Quigley King and Samuel Noble King, who were his classmates at Wittenberg. The Gotwald heresy book notes that the King family was sufficiently wealthy to send all three of them to college at the same time. Not only that, the King family lived close enough to the Wittenberg campus that they were able to walk to class. However, Luther became so infatuated with her that his family feared it would adversely affect his studies. So, they pulled him out of Wittenberg and sent him to Pennsylvania where he continued his studies in Lutheran theology.Gotwald, p. 54. In 1855 he entered Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg, from which he graduated with honors in 1857. Next he entered the Theological Seminary of Gettysburg and after taking a two-year course graduated from that institution in 1859. The Lutheran Synod of West Pennsylvania ordained Luther Alexander Gotwald at Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. A year later the same synod licensed him to preach.Dr. Benjamin F. Prince, p. 359. Marriage Once he had completed his studies and newly ordained, he made haste to return to Springfield to marry Mary Elizabeth King.

She was the daughter of David and Almena (Caldwell) King. Her father, David King was probably born in Baltimore, Maryland. Her mother, Almena Caldwell King, was born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire on August 16, 1809. However, she moved with her parents when she was young to early Portsmouth, Ohio, which is in southernmost Ohio at the confluence of the Scioto River and the Ohio River, where her father established a successful carpentry business. Both of Mary's parents had been orphans. Her father, David King, was found as a toddler wandering the streets of Baltimore during a yellow fever epidemic in which both his parents presumably died. David knew only his own name and could tell nothing about his parents. He was found in a Baltimore hotel and taken in by a Robert QuigleySee Mrs. Belle McKinney Hays Swope, History of the Families of McKinney-Brady- Quigley, Newville, Pennsylvania., Chambersburg, Pennsylvania., Franklin repository printery, 1905, p.228., for a biography of Robert Quigley, which does not mention his foster unadopted son, David King.

Robert Quigley was also the uncle of Captain Samuel Brady, son of his sister, Mary Quigley Brady. Swope, p.140. Captain Brady is still remembered for having leaped the Cuyahoga River near present-day Kent, Ohio to escape pursuing Indians in what is known today as \\"Brady's Leap\\". There is a park in Kent today and a rest stop on the Ohio Turnpike named \\"Brady's Leap\\" in his honor. Samuel Brady was a foster cousin to David King (Mary Gotwald's father). However, Samuel died in 1895, before David King was born, which means they never met. who had a farm near Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, who reared and educated him. As a child, David King attended the Middle Spring Presbyterian Church, near Shippensburg, with the Quigleys, whereby he became a lifelong Presbyterian and, as result, he brought up his own family as Presbyterians. Almena Caldwell King, Mary Gotwald's mother David King, Mary Gotwald's father Upon attaining adulthood, David King obtained an apprenticeship as a store clerk in Portsmouth, Ohio, where he met teenage Almena Caldwell. Her older brother and father fell from a small boat and drowned in the nearby Scioto River. Soon thereafter, Almena's mother died. Her uncle Hannibal Gilman Hamlin (first cousin to Lincoln's first Vice President, Hannibal Hamlin) became the guardian of her and her brother, Hamlin Caldwell, moved them to Cincinnati and saw to their education. David King married her there when she was seventeen. Gotwald wrote a biography of his parents-in-law in which he pointed out sternly that Almena was too young to marry at seventeen.Rev. Luther A. Gotwald, D.D, David King (Circa 1880), unpublished. Luther's bio of David & Almena on line with commentary Hard copy of original held by Clark County Public Library, Springfield, Ohio. The Kings moved to Tarlton, Ohio, where they opened a general store. Several of Robert Quigley's (her father's foster father) grandchildren moved to Springfield, Ohio. Robert Quigley probably took in David King out of \\"empty nest syndrome\\", since his own children were grown and likely out on their own at the time he found David. According to the Swope Family History, Robert Quigley's second daughter Jennet \\"Jane\\" Quigley married her Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, neighbor, James Rodgers, and continued to live near the Robert Quigley farm. So, it was Robert Quigley's grandchildren, Richard Rodgers, Mary Rodgers, Rachel Rodgers, Dr. Robert Rogers and William Rodgers who lived close to the Quigley farm during David's childhood. They would have been the children with whom David King grew up and with whom he would have been particularly close. Their daughter Mary Rodgers married a Cumberland County neighbor, Isaac Ward. Their daughter Rachel Rodgers never married. Their son, Dr. Robert Rodgers, married Effie Harrison, daughter of a Pennsylvania Militia brigadier general. Their son William Rodgers married the sister of Effie Sarah Harrison. All of these Quigley grandchildren, their spouses and families, apparently except Eleanor, moved to Springfield, Ohio in 1831 (source below says 1833). Springfield was prospering at the time on the newly expanding National Road (modern-day U.S. Route 40 or more roughly Interstate 70). Modern-day Littleton & Rue Funeral Home now occupies the Rodgers mansion at 830 North Limestone Street, Springfield, Ohio. Its web site has this to say about the Rodgers family in Springfield. \\"Dr. Robert Rodgers came to Springfield in 1833. He was born September 17, 1807 in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. The young physician lived with his wife, Effie Harrison Rodgers, and their seven children in a large two story brick house that stood on the north east corner of North Limestone Street and North Street. This site is now occupied by the Springfield News/Sun Newspaper plant. A few doors up North Street in a house that early Clark County Historians describe as \\"handsome\\" lived his brother and sister-in-law, William and Sarah Harrison Rodgers. These two brothers worked very closely together. When William first came to Clark County in 1832, he was a merchant. When ill health caused his retirement from that field, he bought a tract of \\"wild\\" land north of the city. He supervised the clearing and the partial improvements to the land. Then in 1851 he was a constituent member of the company who organized the Springfield Bank. Located on the west side of North Limestone Street close to Main Street, it later became the First National Bank. William would serve on the Board of Directors for many years. While no children were mentioned for William and Sarah, Dr. Rodgers' two sons would become very active in the banking industry. Three doors south of the bank Dr. Rodgers had his office. Here was organized the Clark County Medical Society on May 31, 1850 with Dr. Rodgers serving as the President. At one meeting of the Medical Society, Dr. Rodgers, being a skilled surgeon, read a paper describing a new operation he had performed, the first Cesarean Section done in Clark County. A few years after his arrival in Springfield, he began buying land in the northern section of Springfield. In 1848 he laid out the first of five additions. In 1909 a Richard Rodgers laid out the sixth. These additions include the area north from Chestnut Street to the alley between Cassilly and Cecil streets and from North Limestone Street to Rodgers Drive. On an early city map, they list Limestone Street as the \\"Urbana Pike.\\" Also listed for this area were streets by the name of Gallagher, Hill, Center and Race.\\" The web site also states the comedian Jonathan Winters is a direct lineal descendant of this family and thereby of Robert Quigley as well.Rodgers family in Springfield So, David and Almena King moved there as well in 1840. David proceeded to build a significant portion of early downtown Springfield, which was known for long thereafter as \\"King's Row\\".Sketches of Springfield: Containing an Account of the Early Settlement, \\"By a Citizen\\", January 1, 1952, p.41.

Obituary Luther Gotwald had been out West on church business and stopped in Springfield on his return train trip to find Almena on her death bed.Gotwald, p.61. He immediately telegraphed for Mary to come by train. He was at Almena's side when she died and was undoubtedly a great comfort to her. Unfortunately, Mary was unable to arrive until the next day. After Almena's death, various family members, including Mary's unmarried sister, Sarah Jane King, lived in the King Homestead. When Luther and Mary Gotwald first returned to Springfield to serve as a minister, they first lived in the parsonage of his church. However, when he became a professor at Wittenburg, Luther and Mary Gotwald moved into the King Homestead on Ferncliff Place with Sarah Jane King, whom he called in his David King biography \\"one of the sweetest and best 'Old Maids' that the world has ever had\\". They continued to live in the King Homestead for the rest of their lives. They were living there at the time that Luther's famous heresy trial took place at nearby Wittenberg College. Lutheran Church Rev. Luther Alexander Gotwald, D.D. during his Dayton ministry, c.1868 Gotwald's first ministry was in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, where he remained until 1863. The Gotwald heresy trial book states that, during this ministry in Shippensburg, his wife Mary was able to thoroughly enjoy living among members of the Quigley family, who had brought up her orphan father and after whom her brother, Robert Quigley King was named.Gotwald, p.58. Gotwald then became the pastor in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, for two years, where he preached until 1865. He went from Lebanon in 1865 to serve as the pastor to the First Lutheran Church at Dayton, Ohio, where he remained until 1869, when he had to resign his ministry because of throat problems, which forced him to take a year off from the ministry to recuperate. In October 1870, Gotwald had recovered and was able to assume the ministry at the Lutheran Church in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where he preached until 1874. Gotwald received his honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from Pennsylvania College in 1874, some fifteen years after completing his initial studies. Afterward, for nearly twelve years he was pastor of Saint Paul's English Lutheran Church in York, Pennsylvania. In December 1885, he returned to Springfield and became pastor of the Second Lutheran Church there for three years, which was to be his last pastorate. In December 1888, he was elected to the Professorship of Practical and Historical Theology in the Wittenberg Theological Seminary in Springfield. GotwaldBiography of Rev.

Biography on line. made many intellectual contributions to the Lutheran Church during his long service to it. He was a frequent contributor to the Quarterly Review of the Lutheran Church, published at Gettysburg, and wrote various other papers and periodicals, including a number of pamphlets on historic and ecclesiastical subjects. Two volumes of his sermons were published, which were widely praised. He also authored his 1879 learned work, \\"Church Orders: Of the Necessity of a Right Call to the Ministry.\\" Gotwald served as a director of Wittenberg College from 1865 until 1869, a trustee of Pennsylvania College from 1873 until 1885, a director of the Gettysburg Theological Seminary from 1871 until 1880, a member of the board of Lutheran Home Missions from 1881 until 1885, president of the West Pennsylvania Synod from 1873 until 1876 and a member of the Board of Church Extension from 1874 until 1885. He was often a delegate to the Lutheran General Synod. He helped found the Third Lutheran Church in Springfield in 1887. In Springfield, he later helped found the Fifth Lutheran Church in 1891, the Fourth Lutheran Church in 1898, and the Calvary Lutheran Church in 1900. Civil War Gotwald was a stanch Lincoln Republican and, during the American Civil War, he was a strong Union man. He did all he could to further the interests of the Union cause. To illustrate Gotwald's feeling toward slavery, his autobiography reports this incident from his youth: Lutheran minister Abraham Essick writes in his diary that he bumped into Gotwald on May 8, 1861, at the train depot in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (right after the April 13, 1861 fall of Fort Sumter), who was taking his family to Springfield, Ohio, to leave them there (without doubt at the King Homestead, with his mother in law, Almena Caldwell King), while he joined the Union Army to serve as a chaplain or even a private.Essick diary Gotwald did not so serve. While apparently not formally enlisted in the Union Army, he did serve as the chaplain for a group of Shippensburg soldiers who were getting ready to go off to war. This ended in March 1863, when he assumed a parish in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. There were many Confederate sympathizers in Lebanon, so Gotwald's support of the Union cause was not popular with all his parishioners. When the Confederate Army invaded the North in June 1863, he moved his family to safety with his mother, who lived in Aaronsburg, Pennsylvania.Gotwald, p.60 Luther's brother, Jacob H. Gotwald, was the chief surgeon on board the ship Keystone State under the command of Rear-Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont in the fight at Charleston, South Carolina. His ship was participating in the blockade of Charleston Harbor, when, on January 31, 1863, a Confederate shell hit the ship's boiler, causing it to explode and kill several of its crew. Jacob H. Gotwald was scalded to death while rendering surgical aid to one of the wounded men. He was found still clutching the bandage.Gotwald, p.55 Luther's younger brother, Washington Van Buren Gotwald, was a theological student at the Gettysburg Seminary at the time of the Battle of Gettysburg and actually got caught up in the prelude to the battle. Luther's brother William Henry Harrison Gotwald suspended his studies for the ministry and joined the Union Army. He served at the headquarters at Camp Curtin, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania during the war. Hamlin Caldwell, Uncle to Mary GotwaldDavid King Caldwell, cousin to Mary Gotwald The Civil War brought a family to the King Homestead in Springfield, Ohio, for the duration. Mary King Gotwald's father, David King, had staked his brother-in-law, Hamlin Caldwell, to a cotton business, which flourished, in booming Scottsboro, Alabama.Hamlin Caldwell first resided in and started his cotton business in Bellefonte, Alabama, which was at the time a bustling river port on the Tennessee River close to Scottsboro. However, he later moved his family to Scottsboro. Today, Bellefonte is little more than a wide place in the road. He married Southern belle Martha Jane Snodgrass, started a family, and even owned slaves. However, when the Civil War began, his New Hampshire roots won out, which placed his sympathies with the North, making him a \\"damyankee\\" and not for secession. Those sentiments, plus his family kinship to then vice president and ardent abolitionist Hannibal Hamlin, from whose family he took his first name, made his position in Scottsboro untenable and forced him to flee to the North with his family. However, his sixteen-year-old son, David King Caldwell, had been reared in the South and was every bit the southerner. He ran away and attempted to enlist in the Confederate Army; his father prevailed upon his brother-in-law Confederate Colonel John Snodgrass to reject his enlistment and send him back to his family, which he did, to the utter humiliation of young David.Lala Caldwell Palmer, (granddaughter of Hamlin Caldwell and daughter of David King Caldwell) in her The Scotch-Irish Snodgrass Family in Alabama Politics, by a Double Snodgrass, date unknown writes that her grandparents, Hamlin Caldwell and Martha Jane Snodgrass Caldwell \\"went, taking my father [David King Caldwell], a sixteen-year-old boy with them. He slipped off and showed up at Clarksville, Tennessee, the day before Col. John and his company of Jackson County Hornets were due to go into battle. Col. John said, 'Son you do not want to be sworn in today for we go into battle tomorrow.' My father said, 'I can too fight.' But much to the lifetime disappointment of my father, just then a German came dashing up on a splendid horse and said that he had been sent down by the Vice President Hamlin family to take the place of the young Jackson County boy that had run away from Cincinnati to join Col. John Snodgrass and his Hornets. The army was so much in need of trained soldiers and good horses that the trade was made and my father wanted to go to South America, he felt so humiliated.\\" However, Lala's sister, prolific Snodgrass family historian Daisy Caldwell, adds in her Snodgrass family history the not surprising fact that it was David's father, Hamlin Caldwell, who hired and sent the German substitute. She opined that Col. John did not accept David King Caldwell, because his brother-in-law Hamlin Caldwell asked him not to, unbeknownst to his teenage and headstrong son, David. Ironically, strident abolitionist Vice President Hannibal Hamlin undoubtedly would have been horrified to hear that a soldier had been sent to the Confederacy in his name, ruse or not. One of history's great \\"what ifs\\" is what would have happened to the South, had he been Vice President when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. There is little doubt that, unlike border state President Andrew Johnson (accused by those who tried to impeach him of being too soft), Hannibal Hamlin would not have treated the South kindly. Hamlin Caldwell then weathered the Civil War with his sister, Almena Caldwell King, in the King Homestead in Springfield. His southern wife, Martha Jane, lost a child while living in Springfield; her mental condition deteriorated greatly during her stay there, and she remained mentally incompetent for the rest of her life. David King Caldwell attended Wittenberg College while they were in Springfield. After the war, the family promptly returned to Scottsboro, where they stayed and prospered.There is a Caldwell Street in Scottsboro. Hamlin Street in Scottsboro dead ends at Caldwell School. David King Caldwell is the father of the late Tyler, Texas multimillionaire and philanthropist, David King Caldwell, Jr. (who often went by \\"King Caldwell\\"), who was the founder of the Caldwell Zoo in Tyler. King Caldwell never forgot his Scottsboro, Alabama roots, where he gave generously to local causes. King-Caldwell Park in Scottsboro is named after him. Scottsboro residents recall the time he went to Caldwell School and handed every child in the school a newly minted, shiny quarter (a lot at the time). He gave every one of his financially struggling relatives a hundred dollars every year at Christmas during the Depression, which the child of one of those families recalled with deep gratitude was like a million dollars to them at the time. Another relative recalled that he was like a god to them. Gotwald's brother-in-law, David King, Jr, served as a lieutenant colonel in the Union Army and actively fought in many major battles, including the Battle of Lookout Mountain in Chattanooga, Tennessee. King was for many years after the war the Grand Marshal of the Springfield Memorial Day parade.Obituary of Col. David King, Jr., Springfield Daily News, Springfield, Ohio, October 4, 1926. Obituary of Col. David King Gotwald's brother-in-law Samuel Noble King enlisted in the Union Army as a private, but earned a battlefield promotion to lieutenant and ended the war as a captain in the Union Army. Gotwald's sister-in-law Sarah Jane (Jennie) King was active in the Sanitary Society (which promoted better sanitary conditions for Union soldiers) in Springfield during the war.The History Of Clark County, Ohio, Chicago, Illinois, W. H. Beers & Co., 1881, p.300. Heresy trial Gotwald was tried for heresy by the board of trustees at Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio, on April 4 and April 5, 1893. In his book The Gotwald Trial Revisited, Luther A. Gotwald, Jr tells the story of this trial in detail, and why and how his famous ancestor was tried for heresy on a charge of \\"false teachings\\". This charge was brought by three members of the First Lutheran Church of Dayton, Ohio, who were members of the Wittenberg Board of Trustees. These board members alleged that his teachings espoused the doctrine of the General Council denomination of the Lutheran Church.There was considerable pre-trial wrangling concerning the specifics of the charges upon which Professor Gotwald would be charged. However, in the end, the amended charges against him became these. GENERAL CHARGE The said Luther A. Gotwald, D.D., is disqualified to be a professor in Wittenberg College, for the following reasons: SPECIFIC CHARGES First. Contrary to the Oath and Obligation administered to him at the time of his installation as Professor of Theology at Wittenberg College, his dominant attitude as professor in said college has been, and now is. that of opposition to the type of Lutheranism of the General Synod, which is the type of Lutheranism that dictated the establishment of Wittenberg College, that animated its founders in undertaking it, and in whose interests the original trust was created, in this, to wit: First, That he stated before the Board of Directors of Wittenberg College, at its annual session of the College in June, 1882, that the Symbolic Books were the logical development of the Augsburg Confession: that what he conscientiously believed, that, he would teach whenever he had an opportunity. Second, That he believes in baptismal regeneration independent of faith of the subject: that it is so stated in a sketch of his life in Jenssen's Biography of Lutheran Ministers. Also, he so stated the same to Prof. H.R. Geiger, at Springfield, Ohio, in the summer of 1892, that he taught the same in a lecture dictated to his class in theology in Wittenberg College. Second. He holds on to the type of Lutheranism characteristic of the General Council and opposed to the Lutheranism of Wittenberg College and of the General Synod, in this, to wit: That he stated before the Board of Directors, at its annual session in June, 1892, that he could endorse the General Council except in the matter of pulpit and altar fellowship or the \\"Galesburg Rule.\\" Third. He holds that all doctrines of the Augsburg Confession are fundamental to salvation, to wit: Address before the Board at its June meeting. Fourth He holds that the doctrinal position of the General Synod, when rightly interpreted, is identical with that of the General Council. And this charge is made upon statement of Professor Geiger in an address made before the Wittenberg Synod at its annual meeting in 1892; the time and place of the making of these declarations by Dr. Gotwald to Professor Geiger and others, this committee is unable to state. Fifth. Contrary to the Oath and Obligation administered to him at the time of his installation as Professor of Theology in Wittenberg College, his teaching accords with the type of Lutheranism of the General Council, instead of that which is the Lutheranism of Wittenberg College and of the General Synod, in this, to wit: That he teaches in Wittenberg College what we have already stated to be his dominant attitude under Charge. First: That he further teaches the exclusive type of Lutheranism characteristic of the General Council, namely that all the doctrines of the Augsburg Confession are fundamental: and that teaches private confession and absolution and other like doctrines, never received by the General Synod and contrary to her whole history and her original principles. And that he teaches the schismatic spirit of Lutheran exclusiveness relative to so-called true Lutheran Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. And he teaches that type of Lutheranism which disrupted the General Synod at Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1866, and which is now threatening to revolutionize the doctrines and ritual of the General Synod in the interest of the General Council. Our authority for this statement is the charge made by Alexander Gebhart, Joseph R. Gebhart and Rev. E.E. Baker, in their charges filed with the President of the Board. M.J. FIREY, E.P. OTIS, SAMUEL SCHWARM. Gotwald, p.95-6.Samuel Simon Schmucker The author states that \\"As unusual as it is for a theological professor to have such charges preferred against him, what is even more unusual is the fact that the two competing denominations were making overtures toward closer cooperation with hopes of their eventual merger.\\"Gotwald, p.1. According to A History of Wittenberg College, \\"the 'trial' of Professor L. A. Gotwald at Wittenberg, in 1893, arose from fear that the liberal traditions of the college were threatened by a rising 'exclusive and conservative spirit' symbolized by Gotwald.\\"Harold H. Lentz, A History of Wittenberg College (1845-1945) (Springfield, Ohio, 1946), 176-178. As the Gotwald heresy trial book put it, \\"The 1890s were times when Lutheran were choosing between two identities‚ÄîLutherans who were adapting their teachings and practices to Protestant America following the lead of Dr. Samuel Simon Schmucker; and those who sought their role as maintaining the understandings of the Lutheranism of the Sixteenth Century Reformer Martin Luther. Both sides maintained they were true.\\" Gotwald was defended at this trial by Judge Joseph W. Adair of Noble County, Indiana. At the conclusion of the trial, even the prosecutors joined in the unanimous vote for his acquittal.Note on Gotwald heresey trial, Christian Cyclopedia, Erwin L. Lueker, Luther Poellot, Paul Jackson, Concordia Publishing House, 2000. Note on Gotwald Trial Judge Joseph W. Adair, Defense Attorney for Prof. Gotwald The charges that Professor Gotwald was not teaching correct Lutheran theology swirled around quite some time before formal charges were brought to the Wittenberg Board of Trustees. It undoubtedly owed much of its genesis to Gotwald's ministry in Dayton in which he became embroiled in many stormy debates about church doctrine with some other church leaders. It reached the point that his health gave out and he had to resign his ministry and spend a period of time away from the ministry to recover. It was no coincidence that his most vocal critics and accusers came from Dayton.Gotwald, pp.28-31 Perhaps most damaging in the leadup to the trial were articles in the Lutheran Evangelist that named \\"Luther Gotwald as a teacher not fit to teach in a General Synod Seminary\\".Gotwald pp.83. Ernest E. Baker, accuser of Prof. Gotwald A minority of the Wittenberg board of directors, consisting of Ernest E. Baker, Alexander Gebhart, and Joseph R. Gebhart, sent a minority report to the Miami Synod Convention, which was held in Springfield, Ohio, on October 5 through October 7, 1892, requesting that it investigate whether Prof. Gotwald \\"gloried in the idea that the logical interpretation of the [Augsburg Confession, i.e., orthodox Lutheranism] would lead to the doctrinal basis of the general council (i.e., unorthodox and, at the time, actively competing Lutheranism).\\"Gotwald, p.84. The board of directors, after lengthy debate, pointedly supported all their faculty of their seminary. Alexander Gebhart, accuser Further, a majority of the Wittenberg board of directors had little heart to hear the heresy charges against Gotwald. In fact, the Wittenberg board of directors as well as the Miami Synod Convention passed on the chance to act on the charges brought by this minority of the Wittenberg board of directors.Gotwald pp.84-88. Some Wittenberg Theological Seminary faculty members even tried to talk the accusers out of their intention to take action against Gotwald. Even so, these accusations motivated Gotwald to assure the Wittenberg board of directors in writing on October 31, 1892, that he had \\"never contemplated a change in the doctrinal basis of the General Synod\\".Gotwald, p.86. His assurance included a list of the theological positions he accepted and those he rejected. He requested the opportunity to go before the board and make this assurance in person. However, at this point, the president of the board saw no need, after their lengthy discussion at their regular meeting, to call a special meeting to deal with what it seemed to consider frivolous accusations. Attorney John Luther Zimmerman, Board Chair The Gotwald heresy trial book states that \\"the three rebuffed accusers from Dayton were determined all the more to bring the matter to the Wittenberg Board of Directors for final resolution in a formal heresy trial in the Spring of 1893.\\"Gotwald, p.87. Thus, these detractors continued to argue that while Prof. Gotwald started with orthodox Lutheran doctrine, his interpretation of that doctrine and his teaching, based on his logical extension of that doctrine, ended up in unorthodox beliefs and teachings. The persons who formally brought charges against Gotwald before the directors of Wittenberg College were, of course, his arch detractors, Ernest E. Baker, Alexander Gebhart and Joseph R. Gebhart. They based their charges on what they said he had said to them personally, what he had said at various Lutheran functions and even what had been written about him in his biography in a Lutheran publication as to what he believed himself and as to what he intended to teach his students. The Gotwald heresy trail book says that professor of English and Latin, Charles Lewis Ehrenfeld, was also heavily involved behind the scenes in the drafting of charges against Professor Gotwald. Ehrenfeld had recently survived a student request to the Wittenberg board of directors that he be dismissed, but still had resigned from Wittenberg as a result.Gotwald, pp.83.Prof. Charles Lewis Ehrenfeld, Helped draft charges The charges, as initially filed, were that \\"The said Luther A. Gotwald, D.D. is DISQUALIFIED to be a Professor of Theology in Wittenberg College\\". They included a list of seven charges, all of which probably may be summed in the charge that he was not teaching \\"the type of Lutheranism that dictated the establishment of Wittenberg College, that animated its founders in undertaking it, and in whose interests the original trust was created.\\"Gotwald, p.88. Under Board rules, the filing of these formal charges required Board President John Luther Zimmerman to call a special board meeting to hear evidence regarding those accusations. He called that meeting to begin at 2:00 P.M. on April 4, 1893, in the Wittenberg Recitation Hall, in the College Building on the Wittenberg campus. The accusing board members persuaded a reluctant board member, Rev. E. D. Smith, to serve as the initial prosecutor. Judge Joseph W. Adair and pastor G.M. Grau, represented the defense. At the outset of the trial, the defense moved that the charges be made more specific. The board required the prosecution to do so. There was much heated argument over what those specifics should be. When the board finally adopted the amended charges to be tried, \\"the accusers refused to bring the amended charges claiming that the altered charges were not their charges\\".Gotwald, p.91. The original prosecutor, E. D. Smith, also declined to continue, since the amended charges were not those that he had agreed to prosecute. Board member M. J. Firey reluctantly agreed to continue the prosecution of the case against Gotwald on the amended charges.Gotwald, p.96. Rev. M.J. Firey was once nominated by the Ohio Prohibition Part for Governor. Prince, Standard History of Springfield, p. 442 M. J. Firey, D.D., Substitute Prosecutor Firey had little luck in prosecuting the case, since the original accusers all steadfastly refused to participate in any way and, unlike in a regular court of law, he had no way to force their testimony.Gotwald, p.100. See also, Wittenberg Torch, April 1887, pp.108-109. All the rest of the testimony he called at the trial from fellow faculty members and even a student was basically supportive of Gotwald. With no help from the instigators of the charges, Firey could not make his case.Board President John Luther Zimmerman was not a clergyman, but a brilliant lawyer, with aspirations of running for governor and whose son, Charles Ballard Zimmerman, later became Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. His disdain for what he, lacking a doctor of divinity degree, may well have seen as hair splitting esoterics is rather apparent in his pointed attempt to just ignore the whole thing. It would have been easy for a man of his training and talents to arrange the amended charges so the accusers could not win. If the prosecution could not make its case, neither he nor the other board members had to come down on either side of the merits of the dispute. Untrained in the law, the accusers could not match wits with him and they likely never had a chance. It is also relevant to note that Luther's son, Rev. Frederick Gebhart Gotwald apprenticed as a lawyer in John Zimmerman's law office, before Frederick decided to enter the Lutheran ministry, instead of becoming a lawyer. Further, Luther's architect son, Robert Caldwell Gotwald, was chosen to design the Zimmerman Library at Wittenberg. Therefore, the bitter assertion of Luther's accusers that the amended charges were not their charges was likely correct. The trial ended abruptly in acquittal, before Gotwald had presented the bulk of his defense ‚Äì apparently to his great disappointment. Twenty five court members voted to acquit, including prosecutors Firey and Smith. His three accusers, Ernest E. Baker, Alexander Gebhart, and Joseph R. Gebhart, abstained from the vote.Gotwald, p.103. Wittenberg later published and distributed Gotwald's unpresented defense to the unclear charges. Still, his accusers later stated in The Lutheran Evangelist that the proceeding against Gotwald had been a \\"mock trial\\". They even threatened to appeal the outcome to the Ohio Supreme Court, but of course they could not appeal the outcome of a church trial to a secular court.Gotwald, p.105. Following the trial, and at least in partial response to the publicity attending it, the General Synod at Canton and the general counsel of Fort Wayne, Indiana made large steps in resolving the differences between them.Gotwald p.106-109. The General Synod and the General Council joined into the United Lutheran Church in America on November 15, 1918, in New York City. John L. Zimmerman, who presided at the Gotwald trial, was elected to its executive board.Gotwald p.118. Even so, as is true with virtually all major denominations, the debate between the conservative and liberal persuasions of the Lutheran Church continues today. As the Gotwald heresy trial book puts it, in \\"the Twenty- first Century, in the wake of the ecumenical movement, Lutherans are again being challenged to identify their reasons for being and knowing their true identity. Readers will find many of the same issues which dominated the trial of Luther Gotwald are still with us today, making it a good reason for becoming acquainted with its issues and how they were dealt with.\\" Later life Luther Alexander Gotwald & Frederick Gotwald, holding Luther, Jr. July 28, 1900 Prof. Gotwald's chair, in which he is seated in 1900 photo above. He died seated in this chair. Owned by Rev. Luther Gotwald, Jr., Davidsville, PA Gotwald continued to serve as a professor at Wittenberg, where he continued to be much loved and held in high esteem. He was stricken with paralysis in 1895 and had to resign. The Wittenberg Torch gives this account of it. \\"About 6:30 last Saturday evening, just after the reverend doctor had arisen from the supper table and gone to his study, his family heard him fall. His groans soon brought them to his side. It was found that he was unconscious and his son, Dr. [David] King Gotwald was hastily sent for [he only lived two houses north of the King Homestead]. He together with Dr. [John Harrison] Rodgers [a great grandson of Robert Quigley] worked with the patient for some time before consciousness was restored. It was discovered that his right side was paralyzed. He suffered greatly Saturday evening, but throughout the Sabbath he rested easily. He was unable to use his voice until Sunday evening, when he spoke a few words. The entire body of students greatly sympathize with Dr. Gotwald and his family in their affliction. The reverend professor is universally loved and respected by all, and it is hoped that he will soon be restored to his accustomed health.\\"Wittenberg Torch, Springfield, Ohio, November 5, 1895, p.53. The stroke affected his speech and left him partially paralyzed on the right side ‚Äì unable to perform further either as a professor or in the ministry. In his autobiography, he resigns himself to this fate by merely exclaiming, \\"God Reigns\\".Gotwald Autobiography, p. 69. He was then cared for by his son George, by his daughters, Almena and Mary Susan Gotwald, who were living in the King Homestead during the time period, and, by his wife Mary Elizabeth for the next five years. The fact that he did recover some of this health is evidenced by photos taken of him standing and smiling, and in the fact that he participated in the founding of the Calvary Lutheran Church in Springfield in 1900‚Äîthe year of his death. However, he died in Springfield, Ohio, later that year, on September 15, 1900. As his grandson, Luther A. Gotwald, Sr. reports it, \\"on [that] evening, as he sat in his chair by his desk, he had just asked his wife to open the Bible and read their evening lesson together. Suddenly, as a result of another heart attack, he passed away, painlessly and quietly\\".Gotwald, p.114. David H. Bauslin, dean of Hamma Divinity School The president of Wittenberg, Dr. Samuel A. Ort, delivered an eloquent oration at his funeral which was full of affection and praise.Wittenberg Torch, Springfield, Ohio, September 22, 1900, p.1. Here is Dr. Ort's entire oration. Friends and Brethren: And what shall I say? A most devoted, an ever faithful husband, a very loving and loveable father, a true man of God, a Christian indeed, an earnest pungent preacher of the Gospel of our Lord, a workman that needed not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth, a brother beloved, a friend, firm and lasting, is with us in earthly life no longer. On the evening of last Saturday, just when the twilight had shaded into night, his spirit swept through the gates of the Eternal City, and Luther A. Gotwald was among the glorious company of the just, beholding the One whom he had served so well, and uniting with the multitude of the redeemed in singing the new song: \\"Worthy is that lamb that was slain, to receive riches and power and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.\\" Happy soul! Beyond the toil, the trouble and the evil of the restless world; beyond the pain, the sadness and the care of mortal life; in the society of the heavenly great and good; more than that, with those he longed to greet again, his own; still more, with his elder brother, the crucified, the risen and exalted One, in the bosom of the Father, what joyous state! \\"What radiancy of glory, what light beyond compare,\\" enswathes him! \\"Happy spirit! Thou art fled. Where no grief can entrance find; lulled to rest the aching head. Soothed the anguish of the mind.\\" But we miss thee; miss thee at home, in the house of worship, in the social circle, in the place of learning, everywhere we miss thee, husband, father, friend! True, thou hast left behind a richest legacy of a manly, Christian life, of love that will never perish, of friendship that can never be lost, of deeds that are immortal. But still we miss thee, thou worthy soul, and must mourn thy going from us, and can talk with thy God face to face, and behold his glory. Twelve years ago, Dr. Gotwald, at the call of Wittenberg College, laid aside an active ministerial life and accepted the position of teacher in the Theological Seminary. He occupied the chair of Practical Theology. Five years ago he was suddenly deprived of the use of his powers, and in this condition remained until a short while since. Dr. Gotwald came to Wittenberg College from a long and busy pastoral life. Twenty nine years had gone when he turned from the public sphere, rich in the experiences of a matchless pastor, to give his thought and care to the training of the young men for the great and precious work of the Gospel ministry. To his last calling he brought a mind well stored with practical knowledge, a heart aglow with truest sympathy, and a soul burning with zeal for God and his Church. He was about his Father's business, whether in the pulpit, in his study, in the sick room or among the people. With his unswerving devotion he came to Wittenberg college to be a potent factor in its progressive life. Immediately on his entrance on the new relation of Divinity professor, he made the greatest good of the Seminary a chief concern. Previously, on solicitation to begin the movement of a Divinity Hall and the placing of our Theological Seminary in right position for most profitable service to the Church, with little hesitation, he responded heartily, with a liberality always characteristic of the man. No sooner was he settled in his new profession, than he proffered unselfish help in the prosecution of much needed undertaking. Through his faithful endeavor, in the face of difficulties, which seemed at times to render impossible a successful ending, and when the hope was gone, the enterprise of a Theological building was brought to a cheering reality. Dr. Gotwald possessed peculiar ability in prompting men and women to benevolent acts. This power backed by faith in divine promise, he was ever willing to exercise, not for vain glory, but for the advantage of a worthy cause. In the exercise of this excellence, he gave himself without grudging to the effort of advancing the prosperity of Wittenberg College. Through term time and vacation period, he toiled for the larger development of our higher educational concerns. He was a man truly valuable to Wittenberg College in all its affairs. With a most unselfish aim and pure purpose, with an ambition to be great only in a loving service of his Lord and Master, he addressed himself with all the energy of his soul to the uplifting of our beloved Wittenberg College on a plane of stronger power and wider influence. For this school he prayed and wrought, to it he gave freely of his treasure, and, in behalf of its better destiny, he ever stood loyal and true. At last, worn and weary, he fell under the first stroke of death to linger awhile helpless and apart from his final work, waiting for the glad summons; Beloved servant, come up higher! How through these days and years we longed to have him back again in the vigor of life. We have wept that we might once more open to him our hearts and talk of the cause so dear to his soul, but the gates remained closed. A noble comrade, a true yoke fellow, we must extol him and say, his value to Wittenberg College was beyond price. And what would his students say were they here today? What precious memories would come trooping back to mind; memories of a pure soul, absorbed in holy work, of a soul so constantly in company with its God and Savior, a soul so hearty and honest in its sympathy for the troubled and discouraged, tender and loving in its every hearing; memories of kind words and helpful deeds, of cheering look and godly walk, of a true and worthy Christian man. He is out of the class room; his lips are closed; his voice is hushed, but he still lives in the life of the young men under his tuition, and whom he ever sought to bring into more intimate communion with their Savior so they might have power with God and men. His influence abides in the hearts of his students, and through them he continues to preach the unsearchable riches of grace. Ah, how many under his eyes during the seven years of his Seminary life could this day rise up and say, he was to me father indeed, so kind, so tender in his sympathy, so loving, so Christ like in spirit, so sincere in his ways. We can never forget him. We have him with us always, his devotion, his unselfish zeal, his faithfulness, his care for our greatest good, his faith and his love, even the man himself in all those qualities, which constitute a worthiest manhood. He is gone. But we can still say while we linger beside his lifeless form: \\"How blest the righteous when he dies, When sinks a weary soul to rest! How mildly beam the closing eyes! How gently cheaves the expiring beast! So fades a summer cloud away; So sinks the gale when storms are o'er; So gently shuts the eye of day; So dies a wave along the shore. A holy quiet reigns around, A calm which life nor death destroys; And nought disturbs that peach profound, Which his unfettered soul enjoys. Life's labor done, as sinks the clay, Light from its load the spirit flies, While heaven and earth combine to say, How blest the righteous when he dies.\\" Luther A. Gotwald is now of the saints in glory. Farewell brother, farewell! Till be meet beyond the river, on the shining shore, and together in the temple of our God adore and worship Him who has saved us by His grace. Till then, good bye! Among the many words of praise Ort had for Gotwald was that \\"he gave himself without grudging to the effort of advancing the prosperity of Wittenberg College. Through term time and vacation period, he toiled for the larger development of our higher educational concerns. He was a man truly valuable to Wittenberg College in all its affairs.\\" He also called him \\"A noble comrade, a true yoke fellow, we must extol him and say, his value to Wittenberg College was beyond price.\\" Mary Elizabeth King Gotwald died on November 13, 1919, also in Springfield, Ohio.

They are buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Springfield, Ohio, not too far from their home. Gotwald children who survived to adulthood All of the Gotwald children who survived to adulthood became respected and prominent citizens. Dr. David King Gotwald, M.D. Dr. David King Gotwald Home Their son Dr. David King Gotwald (who went by \\"King Gotwald\\") became a prominent physician in Springfield who was known for his modest billing for his services. Dr. King Gotwald kept no financial records on his patients. Instead, once a year he sent them all the same bill of five dollars with a promise of caring for them during that year. He received his early education at the York County Academy and the York Collegiate Institute. He began his medical career by studying pharmacy in a drug stores in York and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He next read medicine with a Dr. Jacob Hay of York. Ultimately, he entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1878 and took a complete four years' course in medicine, from which he graduated with honors in 1882. He shared the Henry C. Lea Prize of two hundred dollars for the best graduating thesis, with Mr. Horace F. Jayne, there being 117 in the class. He was then received the appointment of resident physician in Blockeley Hospital in Philadelphia. In the fall of 1883, he married Julia B. Kurtz of York, Pennsylvania. He moved his practice to Springfield, Ohio, on April 1, 1895. He built his own stately home two houses north of the King Homestead, at 505 North Fountain Avenue, even closer to Wittenberg College than the King Homestead. This home was recently restored and looks very much as it did when Dr. Gotwald had it built. In 1898, as assistant surgeon of the Ohio National Guard, he served with his regiment, the 3rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in Cuba. He served as a director of Wittenberg College. His son, William King Gotwald, followed the family calling into the Lutheran ministry and university teaching. He attended Wittenburg College and Hamma Divinity School. He earned his PhD from Johns Hopkins University. He had Lutheran pastorates in churches in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Wapakoneta, Ohio. He taught history at West Virginia Wesleyan College at Buckhannon, West Virginia. He was a professor at Newberry College, South Carolina. In his last nine years he was a professor of ancient and medieval history at Wittenberg College.Obituary of Dr. William King Gotwald, Springfield News, August 15, 1932. George Gotwald Their son George Daniel Gotwald followed in his father's footsteps by graduating from Gettysburg Seminary and serving as a Lutheran clergyman in Kansas. From the time of his birth his parents consecrated him to the Lutheran ministry. They baptized him in infancy and confirmed him in Easter of 1876 in St. Paul's Church in York, Pennsylvania. He attended York County Academy and graduated with honors from Pennsylvania College and was graduated in 1882. He attended the Theological Seminary at Gettysburg for three years. Afterward, he was ordained by the West Pennsylvania Synod in St. Paul's Church at York, Pennsylvania, at the same altar at which he had been confirmed. He married Mary B. Baugher in the summer of 1885. His first ministry was the Mission Church at Salina, Kansas, where he was \\"held in remarkably high esteem by both the congregation and the community.\\"Gotwald autobiography, p. 190 He was chairman of the Music Committee from Pennsylvania College which published The American College Song Book in 1882. In 1888, he became the pastor of the Children's Memorial Lutheran Church in Kansas City, Missouri. Unfortunately, he came down with pneumonia, contracted through a cold, which he caught at a funeral on Christmas Day of 1889. He died on January 12, 1890, after a ministry at Kansas City of only a year and two months. George's grandson, Robert Gotwald Remsberg, became a highly respected philosophy professor at Wittenberg University. He was also an ordained Lutheran minister and served as University Pastor.

Architect Robert Caldwell Gotwald Their son, Robert Caldwell Gotwald, became a well- known architect, who designed many buildings in Springfield and elsewhere. His early education was received at the York County Academy and Pennsylvania College. In 1881 he entered the civil engineering department of Lehigh University at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1885. The Missouri Pacific Railroad hired him right out of school, where for several years he worked laying extensions to its system in southeastern Nebraska. He then became assistant to the city engineer of Omaha for several years. For \\"family reasons\\" he moved to Springfield, Ohio, in 1893, where he not only practiced engineering but also acquired a knowledge of architecture and soon built up a large business in that profession. He designed many of the most prominent buildings in Springfield of that time. He designed the Gotwald Building (sometimes also called the \\"King Gotwald Building\\" and later renamed the \\"M & M Building\\" after the bank that occupied it), which he designed for his brother, Dr. David King Gotwald, and in which both he and Dr. Gotwald kept their offices. He designed several of the Lutheran churches in Springfield as well as the King Building, Arcue Building and the old Zimmerman Library Building at Wittenberg. He designed the old Springfield City Hospital and was on the Springfield Board of Building Commissioners, at the time of his death, which was constructing the new Springfield City Hospital, which still stands and operates.He is still remembered and honored today in Springfield.

He enrolled in the York County Academy until 1884. He attended the York Collegiate Institute for one year. In the fall of 1885 he entered the sophomore class of Pennsylvania College, but only completed one term, because on November 3 of that year, his father moved to Springfield, Ohio, and placed his two sons in Wittenberg College. He married Julia Agnes Small of York, Pennsylvania on June 10, 1897. He built a house next to his father's in 1897. He graduated from Wittenberg in 1888. After college, he studied law in the office of attorney John L. Zimmerman (who presided at his father's heresy trial) from September 1, 1888, until February 1, 1889. He entered Wittenberg Theological Seminary, where his father had become professor two months earlier and began his preparation for the Lutheran ministry. He graduated on May 29, 1891, and was ordained by the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Miami in October 1891 at Dayton, Ohio. He became an instructor at Hamma Divinity School at Wittenberg College. He served as a member of the board of directors of Wittenberg College from 1894 until 1898. He became the editor of The Lutheran World in 1885, where he served for fifteen years. He founded the Fifth Lutheran Church in Springfield in 1891 and served for many years as its pastor. In 1900, he organized the Calvary Lutheran Church in Springfield, Ohio.

In 1889 she entered the first year of the Preparatory Department of Wittenberg College. After taking a full seven years course, she graduated in 1896. She then took charge of the King Homestead until her marriage in 1899. During this time she traveled extensively in Colorado, New York City, Boston, and Chicago. In 1897 she was the bridesmaid at her brother Fred's wedding in York, Pennsylvania. On October 12, 1899, she married Glenn M. Cummings, a young attorney from Mansfield, Ohio.

Biography Marthinsen enlisted in the Norwegian Army toward the end of World War I and finished his training as a non-commissioned officer in 1918 and was promoted to sergeant in 1919. After his military service, he most likely served as a sailor until 1928, when he re-enlisted in the army. He was assigned to duties in the border regions between Norway and the Soviet Union and was an intelligence officer in Finnmark during the Winter War, monitoring suspected Communist sympathizers. Marthinsen joined Nasjonal Samling as one of its first members, in 1933. After Nazi Germany had invaded and occupied Norway in April, 1940, Police minister under the puppet Quisling regime, Jonas Lie appointed Marthinsen to command the newly formed National Mobile Police Service, which was later renamed Sikkerhetspolitiet. He was made police general and became a key liaison between Norwegian police forces, the Quisling cabinet, and German Gestapo. He also became leader of the nationwide, paramilitary Hird organization. Marthinsen quickly earned notoriety as the leader of the all-Norwegian police force. He played an instrumental role in implementing the Holocaust in Norway, resulting in the murder of more than 700 Jews and the brutal mistreatment of many more; he was also known to take a relaxed view of legal process, and tolerated if not encouraged torture among his forces. Death and reprisals Marthinsen was assassinated by the Norwegian resistance group Milorg as part of Operation Buzzard, acting on orders from the government in exile. A team of trained gunmen waited for his car behind a woodpile near his home in Blindernveien 74 in Oslo. The car had just started to move when they opened fire with automatic weapons, instantly killing Marthinsen in the passenger seat and lightly wounding his driver. Documents disclosed after the war indicate that the political leadership ordered the assassination to prevent Marthinsen from carrying through his plans to enlist Norwegian paramilitary forces to violently subvert the expected capitulation of Nazi Germany in Norway. Reichskommissar in Norway Josef Terboven convened the same day a meeting with both the Norwegian and German administration in occupied Norway, including SS commander Wilhelm Rediess, head of Sicherheitspolizei, Heinrich Fehlis, Vidkun Quisling, police minister Jonas Lie and minister of justice Sverre Riisn√¶s. Terboven argued that the assassination threatened the credibility of the Nazi regime and requested that 75 Norwegians be executed in retaliation. The Norwegian leaders objected but were overruled, but in subsequent discussions in the following day, the number was reduced to 34. A list of Norwegians was submitted, and those on the list were condemned. Norwegian officers were coerced into carrying through the executions. Some accounts place Riisn√¶s at the executions visibly intoxicated, using his service pistol to participate in the execution. A press release announced that 34 were killed by firing squad, but it turned out that five individuals were kept in prison and discovered after the war.. This brings the number of dead to 29, which is consistent with the numbers in Norsk Krigsleksikon; Aftenposten reports the number as 28. The extent and severity of the reprisals shocked the Norwegian population and government-in- exile, resulting in a general moratorium against targeted killings of high- ranking Nazi officials.Eirik Veum: N√•del√∏se nordmenn Statspolitiet 1941-1945.

UNAIDS estimate there are 3588 prostitutes in the country. The Macedonian government is trying to clamp down on prostitution. STAR-STAR (Association for support of marginalised workers) is a sex worker led support group. Its Executive Board is exclusively made up of sex workers. STAR-STAR was the first sex workers collective in the Balkans. The country is a major transit point for prostitution to the west. The trafficking of women for sex is worth billions in North Macedonia and is considered to be run primarily by Albanian gangsters. The reputed 'kingpin' of sex trafficking, Dilaver Bojku, was murdered by a close range gunshot to the head in August 2017. Legal situation Activities related to prostitution are prohibited in North Macedonia by both the Law on Misdemeanours Against the Public Order and Peace and the Criminal Law 1996. Soliciting in a public place is prohibited by article 19 of the Law on Misdemeanours. The article also prohibits providing space for an act of prostitution. As restaurants, bars and hotels are defined as public places, owners of such places can be fined if prostitution occurs on the premises. Sex in public is also prohibited. Article 191 of the Criminal Law prohibits third party involvement, such as procuring, pimping and profiting from the prostitution of others. Law enforcement is corrupt, and often violent towards sex workers. In a 2007 study reported 82.4% of sex workers had been assaulted by the police. Sex trafficking North Macedonia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls in North Macedonia are subjected to sex trafficking within the country in restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Foreign victims subjected to sex trafficking in North Macedonia typically originate from Eastern Europe, particularly Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine. Citizens of North Macedonia and foreign victims transiting North Macedonia are subjected to sex trafficking in Southern, Central, and Western Europe. Migrants and refugees, particularly women and unaccompanied minors, travelling or being smuggled through North Macedonia are vulnerable to trafficking. Students are vulnerable to false employment promises in other European countries. Traffickers frequently bribe police and labour inspectors. Police have been investigated and convicted for complicity in human trafficking. Articles 418(a) and (d) of the criminal code prohibit all forms of trafficking and prescribe a minimum penalty of four years imprisonment for trafficking adults and 12 years imprisonment for trafficking children. In December 2015, the government deleted article 191(a) on child prostitution, which had allowed the prosecution of child sex traffickers for a lesser offence, and amended article 418(d). The government investigated one sex trafficking case involving six suspects for sex and labour trafficking of children, compared to zero investigations in 2015. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks North Macedonia as a 'Tier 2' country.

His area of expertise is organometallic chemistry and his primary field of research is in the area of polyolefin catalysis, particularly in the area of polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/styrene copolymers, and the combinatorial discovery of organometallic single-site catalysts. Stevens major contributions have come in the discovery and commercial implementation of single-site polyolefin catalysts. He invented and led the commercialization of constrained geometry catalyst for the polymerization of olefins. These have been commercialized by Dow as a number of polymers, elastomers and plostomers. Stevens led efforts in the development of photovoltaic materials based on earth abundant elements prior to his retirement.ACS Press conference: New solar panels made with more common metals could be cheaper and more sustainable http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&node;_id=222&content;_id=CNBP_030557&use;_sec=true&sec;_url_var=region1&__uuid=45149684-b585-4348-9d5a-57cced59e82a Education Born in Miami Springs, Florida, Stevens received his bachelor's in chemistry from The College of Wooster in 1975 and his Ph.D. from Ohio State University in 1979 where he studied with Daryle Busch. His thesis topic was Synthetic and Physical Inorganic chemistry of monomeric molecular oxygen complexes. In 2011, Stevens received an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Texas A&M; University. Advancements to chemistry Stevens is known primarily for the discovery and commercialization of a number of significant families of polymers in widespread commercial use today. This discovery can be found in many forms of consumer products including plastic wine corks; shoe and sneaker insoles; casual plastic footwear (such as Crocs); automobile parts (dashboards, bumpers, hoses, gaskets); food wraps and films like poultry bags; synthetic EPDM rubber, hot melt adhesives and more. Stevens discovered and led the implementation of many families of new single site catalysts, cocatalysts, and new polymers. His ground-breaking discovery of constrained geometry catalysts (see Constrained geometry complex), single-site catalysts for olefin polymerization, today accounts for the production of over 2 billion pounds of polymers per year. In addition, the exquisite control over molecular structure imparted by these discoveries allows the production of an unprecedented breadth of polymers covering a wide array of applications. In a series of elegant studies, Stevens and his coworkers were able to demonstrate that these catalysts had an unusual ability to incorporate long-chain branches into polyethylene, leading to a new class of highly processable ethylene copolymers (US Patent 5,272,236 (and others)). Olefin polymerization catalysis is important because polyolefins are the largest volume thermoplastics produced worldwide. Catalyst structure controls polymer microstructure, which ultimately determines macromolecular properties and applications. Ziegler and Natta won the Nobel Prize for the original discoveries in olefin polymerization catalysis. These catalysts are poorly understood, possess a range of activities within a particular batch of catalyst and are limited in terms of precise control of polymer architecture. Homogeneous, molecular-based or ‚Äúsingle site‚Äù olefin polymerization catalysts have their genesis in the 1950s, with the early discoveries of Breslow and Newberg of Group 4 metallocenes activated with aluminum alkyls. The discoveries of MAO and fluorinated aryl borate cocatalysts reenergized this field, leading to the promise of precise control of molecular architecture for these commercially important polymers. Stevens was among the first to recognize the potential of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening in the discovery of olefin polymerization catalysts. Stevens‚Äô work here led to an amazing hafnium- based catalyst family (few experts would have believed a hafnium complex would have the needed activity) that enables the polymerization of propylene to isotactic polymers and copolymers in a high temperature solution process. In a series of papers and patents starting in 2002, Stevens, along with colleagues and collaborators, disclosed new catalysts which are non-conventional, counter-intuitive, subtle, and have an unprecedented stereoselectivity along with remarkable high temperature performance. This discovery has led to another family of new propene-based polyolefins and a process for the large- scale production of new thermoplastic and elastomeric materials. The resulting polymers have been commercialized under the VERSIFY tradename. His group developed a ‚Äúchain-shuttling‚Äù processes in which polyolefin chains are rapidly exchanged between two single-site catalytic centers to create, catalytically for the first time, olefin block copolymers with thousands of polymer chains produced per catalyst molecule. This remarkable advance was described in a Science paperArriola, Daniel J., et al. \\"Catalytic production of olefin block copolymers via chain shuttling polymerization.\\" Science 312.5774 (2006): 714-719. and is the basis for the successful INFUSE polymer line.

As immigration was curtailed in the 1920s, the League shifted focus to assisting single young women who were seeking employment in the city. Building When this building was constructed, the League spent over $1,000,000, raised by a membership numbering some 12,000 women. The League named the building Casgrain Hall in honor of the League's founder, Anastasia Casgrain.Historical overview The building originally provided accommodations for 250 women. These women were between the ages of 18 and 30 and earned less than $150 per month. The building also housed the League's offices, and included a cafeteria, a chapel, library, ballroom, auditorium and a roof top garden. Later use Over time, the aims of the League changed, as they opened community centers and neighborhood services. In the 1960s, the League began providing housing to women attending Wayne State University's School of Nursing. In 1972, the League repaired and improved the building. In 1982, the building was converted into 82 apartment units for low-income elderly and/or handicapped with Section 8 rent subsidies.

The breeding of these horses has been closely linked to the State Stud of Redefin. Historically influenced by Arabian and Thoroughbred blood, today's Mecklenburger is an athletic riding and driving horse similar to the neighboring Hanoverian. They are bred to the same standards as the other German Warmbloods, and are especially suitable for dressage and show jumping, though they are used for combined driving, eventing and show hunter competition as well. History The facade at the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern State Stud of Redefin The region today known as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was, until 1934, composed of the duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. However, the region was united by virtue of being under the rule of the House of Mecklenburg, so the histories of Schwerin, Strelitz and the other Mecklenburg duchies are intertwined. The history of warmblood horse breeding - that is, a horse that was neither draft horse nor Arabian nor Thoroughbred - in Mecklenburg is similar to that in the rest of Germany. Mecklenburgers prior to World War II were all-purpose utility horses. Individual sires, families or breeders might specialize, but the most economically efficient horse was one that had many uses. Primarily, these uses were cavalry, transport, and agriculture. The requirements for a cavalry horse were affected by three major changes: the decline of the Knight after the 16th century, the popularization of firearms in the late 19th century, and mechanization in the early 20th century. Between the Middle Ages and mechanization, the ideal cavalry horse was athletic, agile and highly obedient. Cavalry horses were typically bred for the nobility, but horses belonging to other residents were trained as \\"remounts.\\" Following mechanization, the role of the cavalry horse in Europe was diminished to ceremonial use. What was required of horses as part of transport was affected by similar advances: the advent of long-distance public stagecoach travel in the 16th century, the invention of the steam engine, and mechanization. Pulling stage coaches did not necessitate beauty, but endurance, efficiency and soundness. Large-scale train transport in Germany took hold late in the 19th century and significantly reduced the need for stage horses. More elegant carriage horses with high-stepping gaits became more popular for short- distance traveling, as did saddle horses. Once again, mechanization all but negated the horse's role in transport. The agricultural niche filled by the horse was also affected by technological achievements. While plows became increasingly lighter and more efficient over time, the primary factor in determining the qualities of a region's plow horse was the soil. Throughout the ages, the demand for agricultural horses was also affected by the local populations, fluctuations in which altered the demand for food. Periods of high growth meant higher food demands, and more demand for plow horses. Yet again, mechanization following World War II ousted the horse from this role. =Early horse breeding in Mecklenburg= An 1898 lithograph of a Mecklenburger During the 18th century when many of Germany's noble houses were establishing expansive stud farms to supply their courts with horses suitable for riding, driving, and cavalry purposes, horse-breeding in Mecklenburg was chiefly motivated by large, private stud farms. Residents had some access to stallions owned by their rulers, but a state breeding program did not yet exist. Breeding efforts of renown were, however, taking place under the Counts of Plessen by the houses of Bassewitz and Hahn. Indeed, the versatile horses bred in the region were of distinctive eastern (\\"oriental\\") type and were well known as coach, saddle, and utility horses. In horse breeding, the term \\"oriental\\" suggests the influence of horses from the Middle East, including Arabian horses and Turkoman horses. Another characteristic of Mecklenburg breeding is the early involvement with the English Thoroughbred racehorse. The first-ever race track in Germany was created in 1822 at Bad Doberan, the summer retreat of the court of Schwerin. The Royal Principal Stud, which kept a herd of mares in addition to standing stallions, was founded in 1810 and was followed in 1812 by the State Stud of Redefin. The breeding efforts of these two facilities were combined in 1819 by Joachim von B√ºlow, Senior State Equerry. In addition to the noble warmblood horses for which Mecklenburg was known, Joachim von B√ºlow populated the stud farms and their outposts with elegant Thoroughbred stallions. While the unusual affinity for part- Thoroughbred horses did not always suit the needs of farmers in the region, Redefin supplied the State Stud of Celle with stock year after year, including stallions like Jellachich and Norfolk that would become founders of the Hanoverian. Less than fifteen years after being founded, Redefin was composed of over 134 stallions at 26 outposts. In The Three Musketeers, written in the 1840s, d'Artagnan is given a \\"vigorous Mecklenburg horse\\" to ride. By 1847, less than a fifth of the Redefin stallions were without at least one Thoroughbred grandparent, a trait that began to affect the soundness and longevity of their offspring. In an effort to correct this, draft horse stallions were put to use, but the result was merely a loss of the identifiable type. To regain the utilitarian warmblood type, which differed from the older coach horse type due to the advent of the steam locomotive, suitable horses were purchased from Hannover. As a result of the regular exchange of breeding stock, Mecklenburgers and Hanoverians remained similar to one another, and distinctly different from the heavier Oldenburgers and Holsteiners. =Mecklenburgers in the 20th century= Helga, a chestnut Mecklenburger mare performing the piaffe at the 1963 German Dressage Championships Mecklenburgers at the turn of the 20th century were bred much the same as their Hanoverian counterparts: stylish carriage and saddle horses, still suitable for plowing. As the locomotive replaced the stage coach for long-distance travel, less efficiency of movement was required of driving horses, resulting in higher action. During World War I, however, horses were used to pull artillery wagons and as remounts. In response, the horses were bred to be heavier and calmer. By 1920, Redefin's roster of 176 state-owned sires served over 10,000 mares at over 30 covering stations. But as the demand for horses faded, so too did their numbers: in 1930, only half that number remained. The stock of Redefin were influenced by a merger with Neustrelitz State Stud, reflecting the unification of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. World War II produced a second upsurge in breeding of heavy horses suitable for pulling artillery wagons, so that in 1945, there were 151 Mecklenburg stallions at 44 covering stations. After the end of the war, during Russian occupation of the region, most of the Mecklenburger stallions were sent east. Redefin continued to function as the region's state stud farm, with a herd of mares and over 100 warmblood stallions. The market began to turn towards the production of riding horses in the 1960s. This target was standardized in 1971 and by 1987, 100 state-owned stallions served the region. The mare herd was sold, and Redefin lost the title of \\"Principal\\" state stud in 1993, following German reunification. Today Redefin is composed of 8 covering stations and stands 64 stallions, not all of which are warmbloods. Behind the grand entryway of Redefin now stands an international- caliber riding facility. Modern Mecklenburger CSI 5*-show jumping competition The Mecklenburger has been bred as a riding and sport horse since 1970. The modern Mecklenburg warmblood is best identified by the presence of the region's brand on the left hip, which is in the form of the letter \\"M\\" topped with a stylized crown. Coat color and pattern are not part of the standard, but most Mecklenburgers are modestly marked bays, chestnuts, blacks, or grays. Like other German Warmbloods, the ideal height for Mecklenburgers is between at the withers. Breeding stock that deviate to the extreme may be excluded from the stud book. Mecklenburgers, as warmbloods, are middle-weight, athletic animals rather heavier than Thoroughbreds. Since German reunification in 1990, breeders have pursued standards similar to those of the Hanoverian breeders. The modern Mecklenburger can be called a \\"noble\\" warmblood (edles warmblut), distinguished from the older Heavy warmbloods by the influence of Thoroughbred and Arabian blood and specialization for riding. The breeding goal is a hardy, fertile horse with mental and physical stamina, a good character and lively, balanced temperament. Horses may be suited to any type of riding or driving sport due to expansive, regular paces, a flat-footed walk and vibrant trot and canter. The best heads are fine, dry, and expressive, with a tapering neck and strong topline, withers pronounced and well-laid back, the back strong but flexible, and the croup long, sloping and muscular. The chest and shoulder should have depth and length, respectively. The foundation should be dry on prominent, correct joints and well-shaped hooves. With international jumpers like Antik (Azarro), Chacco-Blue (Chambertin), Luisa and Lady Like (Lord Kemm), Royal Beach Farao and Galan (Golden Miller), this small studbook is producing international competitors as well as leisure riding horses and driving horses.

'SPARQ' was an acronym it stands for: Speed, Power, Agility, Reaction and Quickness.. \\"Nike SPARQ\\" was the name used under a marketing relationship between Nike and SPARQ, under which Nike sells a line of cross training footwear, apparel and equipment in the USA. SPARQ's headquarters was in Portland, Oregon, with a distribution center in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, until its sale to Nike in 2009 (Nike kept the distribution center open in Oconomowoc until March 2010). After the purchase, both the headquarters and distribution center were incorporated into Nike's operations. Some of the products by SPARQ included medicine balls, agility drills, parachutes, slidesteppers, and hurdles.Products on Sparq website (archived, 2004) SPARQ's business were focused on the rating system and selling advanced functional fitness training equipment. The company does not own any training facilities or have any one specific training method. They provided training videos and tips from a number of top speed, strength and conditioning coaches on their website. SPARQ developed a training network made up of over 750 SPARQ Certified Trainers located throughout the country who are both independent coaches and trainers at chain performance centers. Some of the more well-known independent facilities include TopSpeed Strength & Conditioning in Kansas City, the Michael Johnson Performance Center in Dallas and Athletic Evolution in Massachusetts. National training companies include CATZ (the Competitive Athlete Training Zone) and Velocity Sports Performance. SPARQ has formed a broad, non-exclusive partnership with Velocity Sports Performance to provide certified SPARQ Testing at all of their centers. Assessment The SPARQ Rating was a sport-specific assessment of athleticism. SPARQ had test protocols for six sports ‚Äìamerican football, boys'/girls' soccer, baseball, fastpitch, boys'/girls' basketball, as well as a test for general athleticism. The tests were designed to test the skills and athleticism demanded by each sport. In the past years over 44,000 athletes have been assessed and received SPARQ ratings. Some famous athletes who recorded SPARQ Ratings are: * Reggie Bush (93.38) *Tim Tebow (96.92) * Jonathan Stewart (97.54) * Jacoby Ellsbury (102.31) * Gold Medalist decathlete Bryan Clay recorded a football rating of 130.40. * Mike Mitchell, a linebacker for Ohio State, Texas Tech, and Southeastern University holds the national record SPARQ Rating. He set it with a score of 154.47.  Components  The SPARQ general athletic assessment test was composed of: * 20-meter sprint / 40-yard dash (Footspeed) * Kneeling Power Ball Toss (Power) * Agility Shuttle (Agility) * Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test or YIRT (Reaction, Quickness, and Endurance) * Vertical Jump (Power) =40-yard dash= The 40-yard dash was the simplest activity; an athlete runs 40 yards down a track, and his/her time is recorded by a trainer or other method. This time is taken and put into \\"SPARQ Points\\", which were added to determine the athlete's overall rating. =Kneeling power ball toss= In the Kneeling Power Ball Toss, an athlete must kneel with both knees on a flat surface while raising a 2 or 3 kilogram medicine / power ball over their head. They must proceed to thrust outward, landing in a push-up position. The distance in inches is then turned into SPARQ Points to be added to the final score. =Agility shuttle= The Agility Shuttle is a shuttle run in which an athlete must run 5 yards, touch an object or mark, proceed to run 10 yards in the opposite direction and touch a second object or mark. Finally, they must switch direction and run another 5 yards to the starting point. Their time is measured in seconds and transferred into SPARQ Points. =Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (beep test)= The Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test is a test measuring an athlete's aerobic power and execution upon the changing of direction. A recording is played, giving instruction, and the athlete(s) must proceed to run 20 meters at the sound of a beep. At the sound of the second beep the athlete must run back to the starting line, after which the third beep sounds a 10-second recovery period the athlete jogs or walks in a 5-meter zone before resuming position back to the starting line, for the next beep. The time in between each beep (bar the constant 10second recovery) decreases gradually. If the athlete does not reach the start line in time, a warning is given, and the test is completed when two warnings are given. The total time taken until the two warnings are given, i.e. the test is completed, is what is measured. =Vertical jump= During the Vertical Jump, an athlete must stand on a pad with some sort of compatible height measurer attached. The athlete goes into a balanced crouch with their arms behind them to help propel them, then they swiftly jump out into the air, out of their crouch, and the pad measures their height in inches based on the amount of time in the air, between the two points of contact. This then becomes SPARQ points to be added to the score.

It is located on the north bank of the Merced River east of Snelling, at an elevation of 348 feet (106 m). Merced Falls was named for a set of rapids on the Merced River. A post office operated at Merced Falls from 1856 to 1957. The town was founded here because in the California Gold Rush, the three main crossings of the Merced River on the Stockton - Los Angeles Road were located within downstream of the rapids of Merced Falls. Closest to the falls was Phillips' Ferry, then Belts Ferry (later Murray's Ferry and Murray's Bridge and near what later became Merced Falls), and then Young's Ferry. Murray's Bridge was washed away in the Great Flood of 1862 but was later rebuilt. California Farmer and Journal of Useful Sciences, Volume 16, Number 14, January 10, 1862 ‚Äî The Flood at Stanislaus County The rapids of Merced Falls was used in the 1890s to power several watermills located in the town. A pair of sawmills in Merced Falls cut wood for the Yosemite and Sugar Pine Lumber Company, which shipped lumber down from the Sierra Nevada on the Yosemite Valley Railroad. The city continued to function well into the 1920s as a hub for tourists travelling into Yosemite Valley via the railroad. With the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad north-south across the Central Valley, many towns including Merced Falls that were not on the railroad fell into disrepair. The rapids themselves were inundated by McSwain Dam, built across the Merced River in the 1960s. Merced Falls is now surrounded by irrigated farmland, and the community itself is almost abandoned.

At the age of 13, however, he discovered computer software for producing electronic music and became a self-taught producer, and started making rudimentary dance music. The main reason he followed this path and ultimately got more involved in it was because it meant that he could successfully create a whole song on a computer without having to be able to play a musical instrument. His first major influences were groups such as The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers, artists who blended guitars with dance music. He first discovered jungle and drum and bass music after hearing \\"Incredible\\" by M-Beat and General Levy. Douwma did not start taking music production seriously until he left school and deciding what to do for a career. In order to advance and to get more of an understanding of electronic music production, he went to college and studied sound engineering. From 2001‚Äì2002 onwards, largely due to encouragement from his friends, he started sending out demo CDs. His breakthrough came in 2003 when a friend of his who was playing in a club on the same night as RAM Records boss Andy C gave him his demo CD, with his phone number written on it (he had the CD with him so he could have some exclusive tunes to play in his set). After hearing it, Andy was so impressed with the demo, he phoned up Douwma straight away and signed every track instantly, and Douwma was signed to RAM's sister label Frequency, before making his debut on RAM two years later. =2005‚Äì2008: Early career= In March 2005, Douwma had a number one single on the UK Dance Chart with \\"X-Ray / Scarecrow\\". The single reached number 60 on the UK Singles Chart. In June 2008, he hit number one on the UK Dance Chart again with \\"Timewarp / Join the Dots\\". =2009‚Äì2010: Sub Focus= In August 2009, he cracked the UK top 40 for the first time with \\"Rock It / Follow the Light\\", which reached number 38. \\"Rock It / Follow the Light\\" also got him a third UK Dance Chart number one, as well as reaching the B-list of BBC Radio 1's playlist. Sub Focus has also remixed selected works of The Prodigy, deadmau5, Rusko, Dr. Octagon, Empire of the Sun and Dizzee Rascal. On 6 October 2009, Sub Focus released \\"Smooth\\" which was free to download. On 12 October 2009, he released his debut studio album Sub Focus, the album peaked at number 51 on the UK Albums Chart. =2010‚Äì2019: Torus= In 2010, Sub Focus was a support act for Australian drum and bass band Pendulum on their UK tour to promote their third album Immersion. Later that year, he produced the Example track \\"Kickstarts\\" for his second album, Won't Go Quietly. The track was successful in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number three. This makes it Sub Focus' most commercially successful production to date. A free track \\"Falling Down\\" featuring vocals from Kenzie May was released on his website and was later released digitally as an EP. In 2012, he released \\"Out the Blue\\" featuring Alice Gold and it reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart. It was followed by \\"Tidal Wave\\" featuring Alpines which peaked at number 12 in the UK Singles Chart, which also became his first to spend at least two weeks in the top 40. \\"Tidal Wave\\" also featured on the Mercedes Benz \\"Sound with Power\\" advertising campaign, along with Tinie Tempah. On 12 May 2013, \\"Endorphins\\" featuring Alex Clare was released, continuing his recent chart success, peaking at number 10 in the UK Singles Chart. The album's fifth single \\"Turn It Around\\" was released on 22 September 2013 and reached number 14. His second studio album Torus was released on 30 September 2013. He headlined the Radio 1 Dance stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals 2013. Sub Focus played at Glastonbury 2013 with his new live show setup. Later in the summer of 2013, he went on to play at Dour Festival, Reading & Leeds, Global Gathering, Bestival and Isle of Wight festival among others. He headlined BBC Radio 1Xtra Live at the Bournemouth International Centre on 7 October. He then completed a 2013 UK tour. The sixth single from Torus, \\"Turn Back Time\\", slowly climbed the UK Singles Chart to number 10. The next single from Torus, a new version of \\"Close\\" featuring a session singer instead of MNEK, failed to chart. =2020‚Äìpresent: Portals= On 15 September 2020, Douwma announced on Twitter that a collaborative album with fellow UK artist Wilkinson would be released on 9 October of that year. The album was made available for pre-order on CD and vinyl. Portals tracklist was revealed by Douwma on 17 September. It contains 11 tracks, including the four singles \\"Air I Breathe\\", \\"Illuminate\\", \\"Just Hold On\\" and \\"Turn the Lights Off\\".

It is one of the 100 Famous Japanese Mountains, reaching at the highest peak. Geography Mount Yake is the most active of all the volcanoes in the Hida Mountains. Its two main peaks are the northern and southern peaks, but visitors can only ascend to the northern peak, as the southern peak is currently a restricted area. A crater lake lies between the two peaks. High viscosity lava flowing from the upper regions of Mount Yake has led to the build up of a lava dome. The heat from the volcano produces many onsen in the surrounding area. Eruptions In 1911, 22 minor eruptions were recorded. In 1915, during the Taish≈ç period, however, there was a major eruption. The flow of the lava blocked the Azusa River, which caused the river to form a lake that was named Lake Taish≈ç.Mount Yake Volcano Disaster Prevention . Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Accessed June 30, 2008. The Azusa River is again flowing today, but the lake still remains. In 1962, there was an eruption that killed two people staying at a small hut near the mouth of the volcano. In 1995, a tunnel was being constructed on the Nagano Prefecture side of the mountain, through Mount Akandana, which was thought to be part of Mount Yake. At 2:25pm on February 11, the workers encountered volcanic gases, which were quickly followed by a phreatic eruption on Mount Yake, leading to the death of four people. Later explorations have shown that Mount Akandana is an independent volcano. There is still an active fumarole near the mountain's peak.

Forcible prostitution, any kind of brothels, or procuring are treated as a felony, while voluntary prostitution is considered to be infraction against public order (for prostitutes only; clients are not in violation of law). Like in many other Southeast European countries, the problem of human trafficking for the purposes of sex is big in Croatia. Many women from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Eastern Europe, especially from Ukraine, work as prostitutes in Croatia. Some prostitutes commute to the island of Hvar, which is a popular tourist destination. History At the turn of the 20th century, prostitution was legal. In Zagreb it was advertised as a tourist attraction and contributed to the city's economy. Tkalƒçiƒáeva Street was the main centre for brothels. At one stage every other building was a bordello. To open a brothel, the owner had to register at the town hall and received a licence. The licence required the brothel to be well run and provide a quality service. The women working in the brothels had to have a twice weekly medical examination. Brothels were not allowed to advertise their presence, but a discrete, uncommonly coloured lantern was allowed to be placed outside. The best known brothels in Zagreb were the Kod Zelene Lampe (Green Lantern's), which was the most expensive, the Pick, and the Klub which had cabaret until 5 a.m. The Bijela Laƒëa (\\"White Vessel\\") was known for its mandolin music and fine wine. The Zagreb brothels continued to operate until World War II. Following the creation of communist Yugoslavia after WWII, prostitution was made illegal. In the 1970s, Zagreb became known as the centre of prostitution in Yugoslavia, with the highest number of prostitutes. Women from other areas of Yugoslavia, such as Sarajevo, came to the city because of the higher rates for prostitutes compared to their own areas. The economic crisis, post-communist turmoil and subsequent arrival of international military personnel, demand for prostitution rose. The opening of borders allowed foreign prostitutes to come to the country. Legal situation Two acts of law criminalise prostitution and related activities. the \\"Act on the Misdemeanours against Public Peace and Order\\" criminalises the selling of sex and some third-party involvement. The Criminal Code also makes third-party involvement illegal. =Act on the Misdemeanours against Public Peace and Order= This act was added to Croatian legislation in the year 2000. Article 7 forbids using premises for prostitution and enabling or helping another person to engage in prostitution. The punishment is a fine or up to 60 days' imprisonment. Article 12 forbids 'falling into' prostitution. This is interpreted as repeatedly selling sex. The punishment is a fine or up to 30 days' imprisonment. Additionally, offenders may be made to undergo STI and HIV testing and treatment if infected. They can also be expelled from the area the offence took place in for a period of 30 days to 6 months. =Criminal Code= Since the 1997 Croatian criminal law reform, certain activities related to prostitution were included in the Criminal Code. Trafficking in human beings was added to the code in 2003. Within the code, Article 175, \\"Offences against Sexual Freedom\\", criminalises organising, inciting a person to, or abetting prostitution. The punishment is 6 months' to 5 years' imprisonment, or 1 to 10 years if there is any compulsion (force, threat, deceit, abuse of power) involved. Article 162, \\"Section of Offences of Sexual Abuse of Children\\", increases punishment to 1 to 10 years' imprisonment if children are involved, or to 3 to 15 years if there is also any compulsion. =Clients= Apart from Article 175 of the Criminal Code criminalising purchasing sexual services from underage, coerced or trafficked prostitutes, clients commit no offence. In 2012, the Ministry of the Interior proposed criminalising clients but this was never presented to the Croatian Parliament. The Ministry also made similar proposals in May 2016. Sex trafficking Croatia is a destination, source, and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Migrants in transit, particularly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, are forced into debt bondage by their smugglers to pay off smuggling fees. Croatian women and girls, some of whom respond to false job offers online, are exploited in sex trafficking within the country and elsewhere in Europe. In previous years, traffickers target Croatian girls in state institutions and subjected them to sex trafficking. Women and girls from the Balkans and Central Europe are subjected to sex trafficking in Croatia. Articles 105 and 106 of the criminal code criminalise all forms of trafficking and prescribe penalties of one to 15 years' imprisonment. The government investigated seven trafficking cases, the same number investigated in 2015, involving 11 alleged perpetrators. The government prosecuted 11 defendants (five for child sex trafficking, two for sex trafficking, and four for forced labour), compared to four defendants in 2015. Courts convicted seven traffickers (eight in 2015), five of which were appealable verdicts and two were final verdicts with sentences of six years' imprisonment for a sex trafficking case. Police identified 17 sex trafficking victims in 2016, compared to 38 sex trafficking victims in 2015. The Ministry of Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy (MDFYSP) spent approximately 400,000 kunas (US$56,740) to support two shelters and provide monthly stipends for victims, compared to 446,541 kunas (US$63,340) in 2015. The government provided shelter for one child, two females, and one male. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Croatia as a 'Tier 2' country.

Political career After serving for a decade on the city council, including her 1969 service as the city's first woman mayor Pro Tem, Cockrell was elected in 1975 to the first of four two-year terms as Mayor of San Antonio. At the time of her inauguration, San Antonio's population gave her the status of the mayor over the largest American city being governed by a woman. She is often listed as the first woman in the United States to be elected mayor of a major metropolis. However, Bertha Knight Landes was mayor of Seattle 1926‚Äì1928. Cockrell's first three terms ran consecutively 1975‚Äì1981. At the end of her third term, she chose not to run because of the illness of her husband Sidney Earl Cockrell Jr. She was succeeded by Henry Cisneros. Widowed in 1986, she was elected to her fourth term as mayor in 1989 when Cisneros left office. Retirement After retiring from political office, Cockrell served on many municipal commissions and civic boards. In 2013, she retired as president of the San Antonio Parks Foundation, a position she had held since 1998. Cockrell was a member of the Hot Wells Conservancy Board, which is working with the Bexar County Commissioners Court to restore the former Hot Wells hotel, spa, and bathhouses, which flourished in the first two decades of the 20th century. It is located along the San Antonio River in the southside of the city. On May 29, 2019 Cockrell was denied to vote in the 2019 San Antonio mayoral election because she lacked the required identification under Texas ID laws. Many people in the San Antonio community as well as politicians such as Pete Buttigieg were outraged that Cockrell was denied to cast her ballot. The incident started up a controversy about Texas voter ID laws. On May 31, 2019, Cockrell casted her vote in the election. =Death= Cockrell's Health declined in the time leading up to her death. Cockrell died at the age of 97 under hospice care on August 29, 2019 in her apartment in San Antonio, Texas. On September 3, 2019, a public visitation was held at Mission Park Funeral Chapel North. On September 5, 2019, a private memorial service and a public tribute were held at the Lila Cockrell Theatre. Her final burial place is Mission Burial Park North in San Antonio.

Wrecks  Six of these were intentionally sunk. * Ruby E. ‚Äì Coast Guard cutter * El Rey ‚Äì kelp harvester * Yukon ‚Äì a Canadian navy ship * Shooter's Fantasy * Barge #1 * Strider * NOSC Tower ‚Äì a research and communication platform that collapsed during a storm * P-38  Description  Wreck Alley is located at Sunken Harbor, an artificial reef and SCUBA diving destination off the coast of San Diego. In addition to the artificial reef created by multiple shipwrecks, the area also includes submerged ocean platforms and remains of the old Ingraham Street Bridge. Metridium Anemone on Yukon - Sunken Harbor, San Diego, CA These different sunken structures make artificial reefs well positioned in the cold nutrient rich currents. Filter feeders compete for room to anchor themselves. Most prevalent are Corynactis californica anemones. The other most common species is the large, snow white Metridium anemone. There are numerous other species on the wrecks, including other anemones, scallops, barnacles, tunicates, zoanthids, crabs, starfish, brittle stars, nudibranchs, fish and other species. Aggregating Anemone - Sunken Harbor, San Diego, CA Another dive in Sunken Harbor is the Ingraham Street Bridge. When Mission Bay was developed and the old bridge was replaced, all its parts were taken out and dumped in about 60 feet of water. Some areas of the structure that are more in the current, have an encrusting of filter feeders like the wrecks, but much of it is like most natural reefs with kelps, fans and algaes growing over it. Since there is more cover here, there are a lot more fish here than at the wrecks, especially at night. Sunken Harbor is a good place to look for lobster in the beginning of the season as well. Most of the wrecks are well marked with surface buoys.  The Yukon  Electrical Panel in Yukon now in Wreck Alley, San Diego, CA Yukon - Canadian Mackenzie Class Destroyer * Length: 366 Feet - 111 Meters * Breadth: 42 Feet - 13 Meters * Tons: 2380 * Built: 1959; * Hull Construction: Steel * Date of Sinking: July 14, 2000 * GPS Coordinates: 32 46.80N 117 17.12W * Depth: 68 Feet (Highest point at stern) to 105 Feet (Lowest point at bow) * Position: on Port side The Yukon was purchased by the San Diego Oceans Foundation for the purpose of sinking in Wreck Alley. Volunteers spent an enormous amount of time and energy cleaning the wreck and preparing it as a safe dive site for divers of many levels. Holes were cut into the hull so that almost anywhere you are in the wreck, you are near an exit. From inside the wreck, the openings to the outside look like green video screens. It is the newest wreck so it is the most intact wreck at Wreck Alley. Originally it was prepared so that there was one long corridor, called the Grand Promenade, that went the length of the ship along the port side. For publicity before its sinking, a large game of Sink My Battleship was held. The winner got the privilege of pushing the button that would scuttle the ship. Unfortunately, the night before, a wind came up and the ship sank on its own. Also quite unfortunately, it fell on its port side, putting the Grand Promenade at 105 feet and making it an advanced dive instead of an intermediate dive as was planned. The Yukon was not a cargo ship, it was designed to carry a crew - its bulkheads and low decks form a maze of narrow passages and small compartments. Divers need to be careful as a lot of sand and silt has entered the wreck.  The Ruby E  The Ruby E - Coast Guard Cutter * Length: 165 Feet * Breadth: 382 Feet * Tons: 150 * Built: 1934; * Hull Construction: Steel * Date of Sinking: 1989 * Depth: 85 Feet * Coordinates: 117 16'36\\" W, 32 46'02\\" N * Position: Upright The Ruby E is the 165 foot Coast Guard Cutter Cyane, built in 1934 in Seattle, Washington and designed for the enforcement of Prohibition. During World War II, The Ruby E conducted anti-submarine and search and rescue patrols. She also served as an escort for convoys, mostly along the West Coast of the United States. Sold in 1954, she served as a fish-processing vessel. Sold again, the ship was renamed the Ruby E and outfitted as a salvage vessel. Her new owners ran into financial difficulties and could not repay their bank loans. The Ruby E was seized as a bank repossession and sat in San Diego harbor until it was purchased by the San Diego Tug and Barge Company. In 1989, the Ruby E was intentionally sunk as an artificial reef at Sunken Harbor off the coast of San Diego. The Ruby E has a number of easy penetration points, but should be entered only with experience and caution. The easiest point to enter is the wheelhouse, which has round portholes. The other interesting point in the wreck is the engine room, with two large diesel engines. The heads are off, exposing the large valve and rocker mechanisms. Ruby E sits upright and intact on the bottom with only the slightest list to the port side. All areas of the wreck except the bilge are easily accessible. The bow of the Ruby E points in a northerly direction and lies in about 90 feet of water. Strawberry Anemones on Ruby E - Sunken Harbor, San Diego, CA The wreck is in good condition.  The El Rey  The El Rey was a Kelco kelp cutter vessel that harvested the top three feet of the kelp canopy from Point Conception to Mexico. It was capable of carrying 300 tons of kelp. As a kelp cutter, it had a very unusual appearance. In her 35-year career, she made some 3600 voyages and traveled more than 800,000 miles. The vessel was retired in 1981 and destined for the scrap yard. Instead, the San Diego Council of Diving Instructors and The California Department of Fish and Game requested her for an artificial reef program. Kelco donated the retired ship. It was cleaned to prevent pollution and prepared to be diver safe. On April 2, 1987, the El Rey was towed to Sunken Harbor off of San Diego. A U.S. Navy Demolition Team used explosives to sink her. She came to rest upright on the bottom. The wreck has deteriorated over the years. There are many fish living in the wreck.  Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) Tower  NOS Tower in Wreck Alley, San Diego, CA The NOSC tower is an old Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) tower dedicated to oceanic research that was built in 1959 about a half mile offshore. One day after a storm, it wasn't there anymore. Now it sits in sixty feet of water. It looks like an oil rig. It is now an amazing artificial reef covered in life, particularly thick growths of brilliantly colored Strawberry Anemones. There is some fish life as well. Because it was knocked down in a storm, it is the only true wreck in Wreck Alley. The remains of the tower are covered in Corynactis anemone.  Ingraham Street Bridges  Garibaldi near Wreck Alley, San Diego, CA The Ingraham Street Bridges spanned Mission Bay. When they were replaced in 1985 the old bridge pilings and roadway were dumped in the Wreck Alley area. These were huge pieces of bridge, roadway, railings and pillars, all jumbled together. There were many fish and various crawling sealife as well. There were also many clumps of strawberry-colored Corynactis anemones on the lower sections of the reef and on the top flat sections, pink and brown Gorgonian sea fans grow thick.  The Sewer Pipe  A bit south of Wreck Alley, sticking west out of Point Loma, is The Sewer Pipe. It is covered in rocks so it is like a large underwater break wall that sticks up about 30 feet from the bottom. It extends about a mile from shore. It is covered in golden laminaria kelp and numerous gorgonian sea fans. As it has many holes, it is filled with life of all kinds.http://www.diver.net/seahunt - seahunt Diving For The Fun Of It  British Virgin Islands  In the British Virgin Islands, there is another collection of intentionally sunk wrecks for scuba divers, also referred to as \\"wreck alley\\", a couple of hundred yards offshore from Cooper Island.

It is located at 79 Duke Street in Kingston, Jamaica. It was built by Thomas Hibbert, a wealthy young English merchant, in 1755 to serve as his residence. Hibbert migrated to Kingston in 1734, at a time when Jamaica was becoming the largest and wealthiest of the British Caribbean islands and the largest single destination of African slaves. In the early 1750s, he formed a partnership with Nathaniel Sprigg to serve as factors for slaves, purchasing them off the ships from Africa and reselling them to planters and others in Jamaica. Hibbert also helped found a major West Indian house in London, trading in sugar and rum. The building The house is symmetrical, constructed of brick, stone and timber. The walls are of Flemish- bonded red brick with contrasting limestone quoins, which are pronounced on the exterior of the building. The front of the building has been altered, with the addition of beautiful Jamaican Vernacular fretwork which allows for some amount of privacy and yet allows you to enjoy the sea breeze.Hibbert House , Jamaica National Heritage Trust. The house is a two-story building with a large basement used for storage, and an attic with dormer windows. The first floor was used as offices and entertainment, while the upper floor was used as bedrooms. To the back of the building are a courtyard and several outhouses. Inside the house are several interesting features worthy of note. These include the fine brickwork in the basement and the exquisite staircase leading from the ground floor to the first. History \\"Head-Quarter House, Kingston\\", illustration of article \\"Cast-away in Jamaica\\" by W.E. Sewell, in Harper's Magazine, January 1861. Hibbert House Headquarters House or \\"Hibbert House\\", as it was known up to the time of the owner's death, stands as a reminder of the wealth and power of the Kingston merchants in their glory days. Hibbert was among the first of many wealthy merchants to build in the Georgian style of architecture. This style had become fashionable in 18th century England. This style would play a large part in the development of Jamaican architecture. Hibbert became involved in politics and in due course was named Speaker of the House of Assembly in 1756. When the Capital of Jamaica temporarily moved from Spanish Town to Kingston in 1754. the House of assembly and Legislative Council held their meetings at Hibbert House until 1758. Hibbert never married, but he maintained a 24-year relationship with Charity Harry, dating from the birth of their daughter Jane in 1756. Charity Harry, described as Hibbert's housekeeper and a \\"free mulatto,\\" could read and own property. Hibbert provided her with a home, clothes, furniture, and other possessions. Upon Hibbert's death the house was passed to his heir and nephew and not to his daughter Jane or long time consort Charity. In 1814 the house was sold to the War Office of the West Indies Regiment to serve as its headquarters,and as the residence for the General of the army that was garrisoned there. This is where it gained the name of \\"Headquarters House\\". Since the house is located near the harbor and it also has a good view of the city the house was very desirable as a military headquarters. It was during this time that the crow's nest/ sentinel post was built on the roof. While Hibbert House served as the Headquarters House, several illustrious commanders resided there: *Willoughby Cotton, who ordered the militia to crush the Christmas Rebellion of enslaved Africans, led by Sam Sharpe in 1831. *William Gomm who founded the Military Hill Station at New Castle, St. Andrew in 1841. *Luke O'Connor, Commander in Chief of the Military Forces which put down the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865. *Mayor John Eyre, organized his attack on St. Thomas to crush the Morant Bay Rebellion at Hibbert House. Recent history Hibbert House was purchased by the Jamaican government in 1872 for five thousand pounds Sterling. Kingston became the permanent seat of the Jamaica legislation and Hibbert house was used as the Offices of Colonial Secretary until 1960. Since 1983, Headquarters House has been used as the head office of the Jamaica National Heritage Trust. The building has survived social, political and structural changes as well as the forces of nature to become a truly national historic treasure, worthy of preservation.

Concert orchestra performs at the Indiana Historical Society in the fall and joins the other orchestras for two performances in the spring. All three orchestras participate in the season finale at the Hilbert Circle Theatre which takes place usually on Mother's day.  History  Susan Kitterman Conducting the New World Youth Symphony Orchestra Susan Kitterman founded the New World Youth Orchestras in 1982. After helping start the orchestra program in the Carmel Clay school system, Ms. Kitterman left her job to start a family. However, she missed conducting her student ensembles, so she decided to get a group of her former students together to start a small, extracurricular musical ensemble. The group formed during the early fall of 1982 and began with eighteen students made up of string, recorder, and flute players. Rehearsals were held at the Carmel Friends Church, and their first concert was held at Second Presbyterian Church on Meridian Street. At this time, the purpose of the organization was simple: to be a place where kids who were serious about studying their instrument could get together with other kids like them that really wanted to play their instruments seriously in an ensemble. The goal was to rehearse and perform at the highest level possible. The following year, the orchestra grew to about thirty students and kept building from there. By the 1984 season, the orchestra had a full wind section. Information about the organization spread mostly by word of mouth. Ms. Kitterman also publicized through private teachers. The group very quickly out grew the stage in the multipurpose room in the Carmel Friend‚Äôs Church, which prompted a move to a new location. Ms. Kitterman decided to look for a location that was more centrally located, and rehearsals moved to North Methodist Church on 38th Street and Meridian. As New World gained momentum, many string players, especially violinists, were expressing interest in joining the orchestra, but not all were ready to play in the ensemble. In order to provide a place for those who were not quite ready to play in New World, Ms. Kitterman decided to start a second orchestra. The Indianapolis Youth Orchestra was founded in 1992, a decade after the New World Chamber Orchestra began. About the time the Indianapolis Youth Orchestra was founded, North Methodist Church was becoming more active and needed the space used for New World rehearsals more often. This prompted New World to find a new rehearsal location. For a couple of years, the organization struggled to find a home, rehearsing in venues such as the Athenaeum and the Indiana Landmarks Society downtown. In 1993, New World moved their office to Symphony Centre, and the Hilbert Circle Theatre became the primary rehearsal location as well as a performance venue for the organization. New World held its first performance at the Hilbert Circle Theatre in 1993, and still holds many of its concerts at this location. By 1995, the organization had grown to over one hundred members, and the top orchestra changed its name to the New World Youth Symphony Orchestra, since it was no longer a chamber sized ensemble. In 2005, the organization expanded yet again to a third orchestra. The Debut Orchestra was founded for similar reasons as the Indianapolis Youth Orchestra. There were many young string players who were playing very well, but if they were accepted into the Indianapolis Youth Orchestra, they would hold the ensemble back. In order to give these players an opportunity to perform in an ensemble New World began the Debut Orchestra. About this time, the Indianapolis Youth Orchestra was renamed the New World Youth Philharmonic Orchestra. About three years later, the Debut Orchestra was renamed the New World Youth Concert Orchestra.  The Young Artist Concerto Competition  In 1988, New World began the Young Artist Concerto Competition. Susan Kitterman felt that there were many students in the orchestra that would benefit from performing a solo with the orchestra. She tried to give as many of these students such an opportunity, but there were other talented students not in the orchestra that she heard about who could enjoy the benefits of such an experience. Thus, the Young Artist Concerto Competition began. The annual competition has two separate divisions: the junior division for students up to age thirteen, and the senior division for students fourteen through eighteen. The winners are awarded cash prizes and the opportunity to perform with New World Youth Symphony Orchestra. The Philharmonic sponsors an internal Concerto Competition each season.  Honors, Awards, and Current Activities  In recent years, the New World Youth Symphony Orchestra has performed with other youth and professional organizations with exciting results. Joint concerts with the Indianapolis Children's Choir, Indianapolis Youth Chorale, Indianapolis Arts Chorale, Indianapolis Chamber Orchestra, and Butler University Choirs have been extremely rewarding. Since 1993, the orchestra annually opens its concert season at the Hilbert Circle Theatre, home of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. These highly successful concerts have featured the retired concertmaster of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, Hidetaro Suzuki; internationally acclaimed cellist, Janos Starker; former Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut; pianist Zeyda Ruga Suzuki; Michael Isaac Strauss, principal violist of the Indianapolis Symphony; actor Clancy Brown; cellist David Darling; Corey Cerovsek; International Violin Competition of Indianapolis laureate Svetlin Roussev; Marianne Tobias, pianist and program annotator; Scott Hostettler, New World alumnus and Chicago Symphony oboist; Grace Fong, pianist and professor at Chapman University; Frank Glover, jazz musician and Indianapolis native; world-renowned trumpeter Allen Vizzutti; and for the fall 2013 opening concert and fall opening concert of the 2017-18 season, pianist Jeeyoon Kim. Orchestra members participate in a variety of enriching activities, including master classes, section coaching, intensive rehearsal retreats, and visits to collegiate music schools in Indiana. Butler University, Ball State University, and Indiana University have generously provided coaching and space for rehearsals and workshops. Many of our young musicians also attend summer music camps and participate in concerto competitions, including the Indiana All-State Orchestra and Band, the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra's Side-by-Side Program, and the ISSMA Solo & Ensemble contests. New World is also well represented at Interlochen Arts Camp, the Aspen Music Festival, the Meadowmount School of Music, the Eastern Music Festival, as well as the Honor Orchestra of America. The 1995-1996 season marked two firsts for the New World Youth Symphony Orchestra. It recorded its first professional compact disc, now in its second printing. In July, the orchestra toured Germany, Austria, and Switzerland enjoying standing room only crowds and enthusiastic standing ovations. The highlight of the tour was participating in the Silver Anniversary of the Youth and Music Festival in Vienna, Austria. In March 2006, the New World Chamber Orchestra was awarded First Place honors in the youth orchestra division of the National Orchestra Festival at the American String Teachers Association national convention in Kansas City, Missouri. In March 2015, the New World Youth Symphony successfully auditioned for the Manhattan Concert Productions's Debut Series, an audition, not a pay-to-play, selection process. The orchestra traveled to New York City in April 2016 for a four-day residency culminating in a 30-minute performance in Carnegie Hall.

The Zookeeper's Wife is a non-fiction book written by the poet and naturalist Diane Ackerman. Drawing on the unpublished diary of Antonina ≈ªabi≈Ñska, it recounts the true story of how Antonina and her husband, Jan ≈ªabi≈Ñski, director of the Warsaw Zoo, saved the lives of 300 Jews who had been imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto following the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. The book was first published in 2007 by W. W. Norton. Plot summary In the 1930s, Jan ≈ªabi≈Ñski is the director of a thriving zoo in Warsaw, Poland. His wife, Antonina, has a remarkable empathy with animals, and their villa in the zoo acts as a nursery and residence for numerous animals, as well as for their son. This part of their life abruptly ends with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, subsequently starting World War II (1939‚Äì1945). Most of the zoo's animals and structures are destroyed in the bombings and siege of the city. The zoo is closed under German occupation, but the ≈ªabi≈Ñskis continue to occupy the villa, and the zoo itself is converted first as a pig farm and subsequently as a fur farm. Jan and Antonina ≈ªabi≈Ñski become active with the Polish underground resistance. At the villa and in the zoo's structures, they secretly shelter Jews, most escaping from the doomed Warsaw ghetto. As many as 300 such \\"guests\\" pass through the zoo, and many survive the war with the ≈ªabi≈Ñskis' and the underground's assistance. Although the German occupiers execute those aiding Jews, Antonina ≈ªabi≈Ñska maintains a semblance of prewar life at the villa, harboring a menagerie of animals ‚Äì such as otters, a badger, hyena pups, lynxes, and a rabbit ‚Äì as well as the secret guests. Jan ≈ªabi≈Ñski is wounded in the armed August 1944 Warsaw uprising against the German occupiers and, for a time, is interned in a POW camp. The ≈ªabi≈Ñskis survive the war and the zoo reopens in 1949, with Jan as its new director. On September 21, 1965, Yad Vashem (Israel's official memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust) recognized Jan and Antonina ≈ªabi≈Ñski as Righteous Among the Nations. Reception =Critical reception= Donna Seaman wrote enthusiastically in her Los Angeles Times review, \\"It is no stretch to say that this is the book Ackerman was meant to write. Ever since A Natural History of the Senses, she has been building a galaxy of incandescent works that celebrate the unity and wonder of the living world. But every rapturous hour she has spent communing with plants and animals, every insight gleaned into human nature, every moment under the spell of language is a steppingstone that led her to Poland, the home of her maternal grandparents, and to the incomparable heroes Jan and Antonina Zabinski. The result of her tenacious research, keen interpretation and her own \\"transmigration of sensibility\\" is a shining book beyond category.\\" D. T. Max wrote in The New York Times, \\"This is an absorbing book, diminished sometimes by the choppy way Ackerman balances Antonina's account with the larger story of the Warsaw Holocaust. For me, the more interesting story is Antonina's. She was not, as her husband once called her, \\"a housewife,\\" but the alpha female in a unique menagerie.\\" For Orion Magazine Susanne Antonetta wrote: \\"Ackerman, with her profound understanding of nature, tells Antonina's story in a way that makes it clear her roles as the zookeeper's wife and heroine of the Resistance are inextricably connected, both in what the natural world has taught her, and taught her to accept.\\" =Popular reception= On February 10, 2008, the book was number 13 on The New York Times non-fiction best seller list.The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller List For February 10, 2008 =Honors= In 2008, The Zookeeper's Wife won the annual Orion Book Award from Orion Magazine; the selection committee noted, \\"The Zookeeper's Wife is a groundbreaking work of nonfiction in which the human relationship to nature is explored in an absolutely original way through looking at the Holocaust.\\" Adaptations In 2013, plans were announced for an eponymous feature film adaptation. The film is based on a screenplay by Angela Workman, directed by Niki Caro, and starring Jessica Chastain, Johan Heldenbergh, Michael McElhatton and Daniel Br√ºhl.

District of Columbia (444 A.2d. 1, D.C. Ct. of Ap. 1981) is a District of Columbia Court of Appeals case that held that the police do not owe a specific duty to provide police services to citizens based on the public duty doctrine. Procedural history In separate cases, Carolyn Warren, Miriam Douglas, Joan Taliaferro, and Wilfred Nichol sued the District of Columbia and individual members of the Metropolitan Police Department for negligent failure to provide adequate police services. The trial judges held that the police were under no specific legal duty to provide protection to the individual plaintiffs and dismissed the complaints. In a 2‚Äì1 decision, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals determined that Warren, Taliaferro, and Nichol were owed a special duty of care by the police department and reversed the trial court rulings. In a unanimous decision, the court also held that Douglas failed to fit within the class of persons to whom a special duty was owed and affirmed the trial court's dismissal of her complaint. The case was reheard by an en banc panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and the defendant (District of Columbia) prevailed. Background =Warren, Taliaferro, and Douglas= In the early morning hours of Sunday, March 16, 1975, Carolyn Warren and Joan Taliaferro, who shared a room on the third floor of their rooming house at 1112 Lamont Street Northwest in the District of Columbia, and Miriam Douglas, who shared a room on the second floor with her four-year-old daughter, were asleep. The women were awakened by the sound of the back door being broken down by two men later identified as Marvin Kent and James Morse. The men entered Douglas' second floor room, where Kent forced Douglas to perform oral sex on him and Morse raped her. Warren and Taliaferro heard Douglas' screams from the floor below. Warren called 9-1-1 and told the dispatcher that the house was being burglarized, and requested immediate assistance. The department employee told her to remain quiet and assured her that police assistance would be dispatched promptly. Warren's call was received at Metropolitan Police Department Headquarters at 6:23 am, and was recorded as a burglary-in-progress. At 6:26, a call was dispatched to officers on the street as a \\"Code 2\\" assignment, although calls of a crime in progress should be given priority and designated as \\"Code 1.\\" Four police cruisers responded to the broadcast; three to the Lamont Street address and one to another address to investigate a possible suspect. Meanwhile, Warren and Taliaferro crawled from their window onto an adjoining roof and waited for the police to arrive. While there, they observed one policeman drive through the alley behind their house and proceed to the front of the residence without stopping, leaning out the window, or getting out of the car to check the back entrance of the house. A second officer apparently knocked on the door in front of the residence, but left when he received no answer. The three officers departed the scene at 6:33 am, five minutes after they arrived. Warren and Taliaferro crawled back inside their room. They again heard Douglas' continuing screams; again called the police; told the officer that the intruders had entered the home, and requested immediate assistance. Once again, a police officer assured them that help was on the way. This second call was received at 6:42 am and recorded merely as \\"investigate the trouble;\\" it was never dispatched to any police officers. Believing the police might be in the house, Warren and Taliaferro called down to Douglas, thereby alerting Kent to their presence. At knife point, Kent and Morse then forced all three women to accompany them to Kent's apartment. For the next fourteen hours the captive women were raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts upon one another, and made to submit to the sexual demands of Kent and Morse. Warren, Taliaferro, and Douglas brought the following claims of negligence against the District of Columbia and the Metropolitan Police Department: (1) the dispatcher's failure to forward the 6:23 am call with the proper degree of urgency; (2) the responding officers' failure to follow standard police investigative procedures, specifically their failure to check the rear entrance and position themselves properly near the doors and windows to ascertain whether there was any activity inside; and (3) the dispatcher's failure to dispatch the 6:42 am call. =Nichol= On April 30, 1978, at approximately 11:30 pm, appellant Nichol stopped his car for a red light at the intersection of Missouri Avenue and Sixteenth Street, N.W. Unknown occupants in a vehicle directly behind appellant struck his car in the rear several times, and then proceeded to beat appellant about the face and head, breaking his jaw. A Metropolitan Police Department officer arrived at the scene. In response to the officer's direction, appellant's companion ceased any further efforts to obtain identification information of the assailants. When the officer then failed to get the information, leaving Nichol unable to institute legal action against his assailants, Nichol brought a negligence action against the officer, the Metropolitan Police Department and the District of Columbia. Decision In a 4‚Äì3 decision, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courts' dismissal of the complaints against the District of Columbia and individual members of the Metropolitan Police Department based on the public duty doctrine ruling that \\"the duty to provide public services is owed to the public at large, and, absent a special relationship between the police and an individual, no specific legal duty exists\\". The Court thus adopted the trial court's determination that no special relationship existed between the police and appellants, and therefore no specific legal duty existed between the police and the appellants.

The Midway Atoll's unique location halfway between the United States and Japan ensured it would hold a strategic position. This island was the site of the pivotal Battle of Midway which shifted the balance of sea power in the Pacific towards the United States. The atoll's two main islands, Eastern Island and Sand Island, were both fortified by the Navy. Eastern Island, the smaller of the two islands, had three runways in a triangular configuration, and was defended by six coastal and dual-purpose batteries, armed with 3-, 5-, and 7-inch guns. Sand Island, one mile wide and two long, was completely developed by the Navy, but had no runways until after the war. At the time of the battle, Sand Island was defended by six batteries erected by the 6th Defense Battalion, and one by the 3d Defense Battalion. In clockwise order from the northwest corner of the island, these were: Battery C, two 5-inch guns; \\"naval\\" battery, two 3-inch guns; Battery F, four 3-inch guns; Battery A, two 5-inch guns; Battery D, four 3-inch guns; unnamed battery, two 7-inch guns; Battery A, two 5-inch guns; 3d Battalion Battery D, four 3-inch guns. The military shut down all of its bases by 1993, handing over control to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The islands remain mostly uninhabited and unvisited. They are part of PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument. Many of the facilities built by the Navy during the war deteriorated as the population of the Eastern and Sand Islands declined. Some facilities, such as the Eastern Island runways, were abandoned. New runways were built on Sand Island, in some cases destroying some of the surviving war defenses in the process.

The ancient Egbesu cult of the Ijaws declined after the successful British occupation of the Ijaw lands in the late 19th century, and for some time most Ijaws only knew of the cult through folklore and traditional war songs. More recently, members of the cult, also known as the Egbesu Boys, have been fighting against authorities in the Niger Delta in response to environmental and other problems caused by oil exploitation, and lack of investment of oil revenue in the local economy. Many young men have joined the cult, undergoing secret initiations by powerful witchdoctors who impart the supernatural powers of Egbesu. The initiation involves the subject being etched with cicatrices on some hidden part of the body, and some members also wear amulets.

McKenzie Post No. 81, Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.), which was one of 519 GAR posts in Iowa. The building is architecturally significant as it is one of the few examples of a Gothic Revival style structure of this type in the area. with It is a memorial chapel that follows a cross-shaped plan capped by an octagonal cupola with a statue of a Union soldier on top. Its significance is also derived from it being the first G.A.R. Memorial Hall built in Iowa. The Iowa legislature had passed a law in 1884 that allowed counties to levy a tax to support building G.A.R. memorials. Captain Rufus S. Benson, a local state representative, had the law amended in 1886 so that it allowed for the construction of a memorial hall, as the local G.A.R. chapter wanted it to be a place where they could meet.

In the derivation of the method using multiple scattering theory by Jan Korringa and the derivation based on the Kohn and Rostoker variational method, the muffin-tin approximation was used. Later calculations are done with full potentials having no shape restrictions. Introduction All solids in their ideal state are single crystals with the atoms arranged on a periodic lattice. In condensed matter physics, the properties of such solids are explained on the basis of their electronic structure. This requires the solution of a complicated many- electron problem, but the density functional theory of Walter Kohn makes it possible to reduce it to the solution of a Schroedinger equation with a one- electron periodic potential. The problem is further simplified with the use of group theory and in particular Bloch's theorem, which leads to the result that the energy eigenvalues depend on the crystal momentum {\\\\bf{k}} and are divided into bands. Band theory is used to calculate the eigenvalues and wave functions. Many band theory methods have been proposed over the years. Some of the most widely used, such as the electronic structure programs VASP and WIEN2k, make use of approximations so that acceptable accuracy can be achieved with a minimum of computer resources. The KKR method is chosen when the primary goal is high accuracy. The parameters obtained from reliable band- theory calculations are useful in theoretical studies of problems, such as superconductivity, for which the density functional theory does not apply. Mathematical formulation The KKR band theory equations for space-filling non-spherical potentials are derived in books and in the article on multiple scattering theory. The wave function near site j is determined by the coefficients c_{l'm'}^j . According to Bloch's theorem, these coefficients differ only through a phase factor c_{l'm'}^j = {e^{ - i{\\\\bf{k}} \\\\cdot {{\\\\bf{R}}_j}}}{c_{l'm'}}\\\\left( E,{\\\\bf{k}} \\\\right). The {c_{l'm'}}\\\\left( E,{\\\\bf{k}} \\\\right) satisfy the homogeneous equations :\\\\sum\\\\limits_{l'm'} {{M_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( {E,{\\\\bf{k}}} \\\\right){c_{l'm'}}\\\\left(E, {\\\\bf{k}} \\\\right) = 0} , where {M_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( {E,{\\\\bf{k}}} \\\\right) = {m_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( E \\\\right) - {A_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( {E,{\\\\bf{k}}} \\\\right) and {A_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( {E,{\\\\bf{k}}} \\\\right) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j} {{e^{i{\\\\bf{k}} \\\\cdot {{\\\\bf{R}}_{ij}}}}} {g_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( {E,{{\\\\bf{R}}_{ij}}} \\\\right). The {m_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( E \\\\right) is the inverse of the scattering matrix {t_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( E \\\\right) calculated with the non-spherical potential for the site. As pointed out by Korringa, Ewald derived a summation process that makes it possible to calculate the structure constants, {A_{lm,l'm'}}\\\\left( {E,{\\\\bf{k}}} \\\\right). The energy eigenvalues of the periodic solid for a particular {\\\\bf{k}}, {E_b}\\\\left( {\\\\bf{k}} \\\\right), are the roots of the equation \\\\det {\\\\bf{M}}\\\\left( {E,{\\\\bf{k}}} \\\\right) = 0. The eigenfunctions are found by solving for the {c_{l,m}}\\\\left( E,{\\\\bf{k}} \\\\right) with E = {E_b}\\\\left( {\\\\bf{k}} \\\\right). By ignoring all contributions that correspond to an angular momentum l greater than {l_{\\\\max }}, they have dimension {\\\\left( {{l_{\\\\max }} + 1} \\\\right)^2}. In the original derivations of the KKR method, spherically symmetric muffin-tin potentials were used. Such potentials have the advantage that the inverse of the scattering matrix is diagonal in l :{m_{lm,l'm'}} = \\\\left[ {\\\\alpha \\\\cot {\\\\delta _l}\\\\left( E \\\\right) - i\\\\alpha } \\\\right]{\\\\delta _{l,l'}}{\\\\delta _{m,m'}}, where {\\\\delta _l}\\\\left( E \\\\right) is the scattering phase shift that appears in the partial wave analysis in scattering theory. The muffin-tin approximation is good for closely packed metals, but it does not work well for ionic solids like semiconductors. It also leads to errors in calculations of interatomic forces.

Mayor Farrington died while in office, in 1918. The lake is bordered by East Brunswick, North Brunswick and South Brunswick. It covers about 1.17 km¬≤ (290 acres) and has a mean depth of 2 meters (6 ft) with a maximum depth of 4 meters (12 ft). The lake is accessible from a boat ramp; the only powered boats allowed are those with an electric motor. Fish species in the lake include Chain Pickerel, Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Crappie, Brown Trout, Yellow Perch and Rainbow Trout.

The house was originally built in the 14th century as customs and mint, although its present condition derives mostly from a remodelling carried out in the 17th century. Its name derived from an oral tradition that suggested the house was the birthplace of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1394. The Casa do Infante is located in the historical centre of Porto, designated World Heritage Site by UNESCO History A diorama of the medieval village of Porto with S√© Cathedral and Casa do Infante The Neo-manueline plaque marking the birthplace of the Infante D. Henrique, later referred to as Henry the Navigator The customshouse was constructed in 1325 by royal decree on top of a Roman villa. References to the Casas da Alf√¢ndega (customshouses) in the next two years, suggest that it had already been completed and in use. The mediaeval customshouse began being built around 1354 in the reign of King D. Afonso IV (during the context of disputes between the himself and the Bishop of Porto. Afonso intended to charge taxes for goods carried by ships navigating the Douro river, thereby reducing the power of the bishop. Built near the river, the new Royal customshouse minted coin, acted as a warehouse and included living quarters for the employees. Archaeological excavations revealed that the building was large and had two, high towers linked by a courtyard. Chronicler Fern√£o Lopes indicated that Infante D. Henrique was born to King D. John I and Queen Philippa in Porto on 4 March 1394. It is believed that, the future-Henry the Navigator (who would sponsor Portuguese expeditions during the Age of Discovery), would likely have been born here: the customshouse was the only royal building in the city and that it had living quarters for the royal employees, it is likely that the Cortes occupied the building at that time of his birth. This would confirm a long- held oral tradition.The Prince and Porto. Oporto tourism official website. At the end of the 14th century, was the first reference to the Portuense Casa da Moeda (House of Coin) during the reign of King D. Fernando I, that allowed dating of the open space in the principal entrance. In 1587, was the last reference to the work on the Casa da Moeda, but a few years later (1607), a royal letter extinguished the institution. In 1628, there were new references to work in the old House of Coin. The Finance inspector issued an order in 1656 to move the customshouse to the remnants of the House, and to promptly complete its reuse; starting in the 15th century, the customshouse underwent several expansions and re-modellings that altered its original structure. The most important remodelling occurred in 1677, under the reign of King D. Peter II, when the building was virtually rebuilt. The inner courtyard was kept, but the towers were greatly reduced in height, while the front of the building (facing the street) gained two extra storeys, with a large staircase leading to the living quarters in the second floor. The front of the building incorporated the functions of the towers and the storage rooms were greatly enlarged. A commemorative inscription, dated 1677, refers to this change: :SVB PRINCIPE PETRO / ANNO MDCLXXVII / POR DIREC√á√ÉO DO MARQVES DE FRONTEIRA / GENTILHOMEM DA CAMARA DE S.A.

His Inspector of Finances In 1860, the work and construction of the new customshouse in Miragaia, wherein the services were gradually transferred to the new site. In 1894, a new Neo-Manueline plaque was installed on the principal entrance, commemorating the birth of the Infante D. Henrique. The building was re-constructed in 1923, that saw the building obtain a new floor over the principal facade. Between 1957 and 1978, the DGEMN Dire√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) began a series of projects to recuperate and remodel the old customs house. Beginning with surveys and excavations, there were a series of works to restore and consolidate the structure. In 1960, upgrades to the electrical systems and the installation of new lighting highlighted further work on the reinforced concrete pavements. This included supply and placement of wood on the ceiling and halls of the central patio, concrete staircases, work on the windows, sanitation and drainage of the spaces, as well as complementary restoration of the walls, stone slabs and facades. In 1991, the beginning of work to transform the house into the Arquivo Hist√≥rico Municipal do Porto (Porto Municipal Historical Archives), that included an initial phase of archaeological intervention (since 1995) under the responsibility of Manuel Luis Real (director of the AHMP) and archaeologists Paulo Dordio Gomes and Ricardo Teixeira. They discovered vestiges of a large Roman foundation, remains of a mosaic pavement. The second phase of the project, under the direction of Nuno Tasso de Sousa, to transform the interior and exterior to serve its needs: it now houses an exhibition of the history of Porto, including a scale model of medieval Porto, and the municipal archives supported by a dedicated library. Architecture The front facade along the Pra√ßa do Infante D.

Henrique towards the Largo do Terreiro and access to the Cais da Estiva along the Douro. The plan consist of four rectangular, juxtapositioned articulate spaces covered in differentiated of articulated ceiling tiles. The principal facade consists of four storeys covered in canopy windows. On the right-side of the first floor is a large arched doorway, surmounted by the royal coat-of-arms and a 1677 inscription, while the rear corps are uniformly lower. From the entrance is the access to a framed patio surmounted by archway framing the two upper floors, a large door that connects it to the rest of the buildings bodies, towards the east. The first of these buildings is a large space of three naves defined by high arcade. Along its continuity, the buildings have two storeys accessible from the central nave by a staircase. In the rear facade are a series of high windows that illuminate the pavement and patio involving the eastern and northern buildings. From here are accessways to Rua Infante D. Henrique across a ramp and tunnel, that opens to an archway surmounted by royal coat-of-arms. Alongside the door exists a stone with the shield of the Avis dynastic family.

The sites were designated for their association with the Japanese defense of Saipan during World War II, the 1944 Battle of Saipan in which Allied forces captured the island, and the subsequent campaigns which used Saipan as a base. The district includes the landing beaches where the Allies landed, the remnants of Japanese airfields Aslito and Marpi Point, and Isely Field, the Allied airfield built over much of Aslito from which B-29 bombers were used to bomb the Japanese home islands. Included in the Marpi Point area are Suicide Cliff and Banzai Cliff, two locations where significant numbers of Japanese military and civilians jumped to their deaths rather than surrender to advancing forces. The loss of Saipan was a major blow to the Japanese war effort, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, The landmark designation was made in 1985. Landing beaches The main beaches where Allied forces landed during the Battle of Saipan are on the west side of the island, extending from a point south of Garapan southward around Agingan Point and onto Obyan Beach. The landmarked area includes the beaches themselves and the lagoons out to the fringing coral reef. This area includes a small number of remnant Japanese defenses, including several pillboxes, a partially-constructed gun emplacement, and a small Japanese tank that has been set on a pillbox as a sort of monument. Aslito/Isely Field The Japanese built Aslito Airfield, now the site of Saipan International Airport, in 1934. It was captured early in the Battle of Saipan; a significant number of its concrete structures survived the battle and the later development of Isely Field and the present airport. Most of these structures are abandoned; the best-preserved is the former air operations building, which was rehabilitated and used as a tourist bureau. The main elements of Isely Field to survive in the post-war period are its runways, one of which is now used by the modern airport. Elements of the aprons and taxiways used by the B-29s survive to some degree, but are overgrown. Included in this area is a portion of Obyan Beach where a Japanese pillbox is located. Marpi Point Marpi Point is the northernmost part of the island. At the north-facing Suicide Cliff, an unknown but large number of civilians and soldiers jumped to their deaths rather than surrendering to the advancing Allied forces. The area is now marked by memorials at the top and base of the cliff. Nearby is a Japanese cave fortification known locally as the \\"last command post\\". Below this is a plain where the Japanese had built a small airfield, and the Allies later built Marpi Point Field, of which only remnants survive. At the very northernmost point of the island is Banzai Cliff, where more people jumped to their deaths. There is also a well- concealed pillbox whose position commands most of the island's north coast.

Goddard (July 10, 1913 in St. Joseph, Missouri ‚Äì September 29, 1997 in Chico, California) was an American engineer and inventor. He earned a degree in physics from Occidental College. Before working in industry, Goddard was a high school science teacher in Los Angeles. He briefly worked in the aerospace industry for North American Aviation, Inc. before becoming an engineer at International Business Machines (IBM). His most acclaimed achievement is co-inventing along with John Lynott United States Patent 3,503,060, which is entitled ‚ÄúDirect Access Magnetic Disc Storage Device‚Äù. This invention is the claims modern-day hard disk drives. Pre-IBM Goddard worked on wind tunnel work for North American Aviation. He was to work on similar wind tunnel innovations for a Los Angeles airplane manufacturer at IBM, but shortly after he was hired, the contract for that project was dropped. Goddard was instead hired as an engineer, and became involved in the magnetic storage disk project when the United States Air Force called upon IBM in order to be ‚Äúmechanized‚Äù. The base required a mechanism to ‚Äústore data‚Äù virtually for its operations, and from this necessity, the disk storage project was conceived. RAMAC Project at IBM William Goddard and John Lynott were key members of the San Jose, California‚Äìbased engineering team, led by Reynold Johnson with the help of Louis Stevens, that developed the 350 Disk Storage Unit, a major component of the IBM 305 RAMAC Computer.IBM Pioneers to be Inducted Into the National Inventors Hall of Fame The magnetic disk drive symbolized a monumental advance in mass-storage technology. It is responsible for the end of sequential storage and batch processing with punched cards and paper tape. The CPU unit, also known as the 305 Processing unit, was responsible for the write-in and read-out operations of the IBM 350. ‚ÄúInstructions‚Äù were provided to the unit coded as ‚Äúmemory addresses‚Äù. These addresses referred to specific locations on the disc in which a transducer was either commanded to write-in or read-out data. Goddard‚Äôs research began in the early 1950s at IBM‚Äôs Laboratory located on 99 Notre Dame Avenue in San Jose, CA. He did not see his work as particularly complex. As he puts it, ‚Äúit was not high tech, or very scientific. It was more like something you‚Äôd do in your garage.‚Äù The IBM 350 Disk Storage Unit consisted of the magnetic disk memory unit with an access mechanism, the controls for the access mechanism, and a small air compressor. Assembled with covers, the 350 apparatus was 60 inches (1.52 m) long, 68 inches (1.73 m) high and 29 inches (0.74 m) deep. It was configured with 50 magnetic disks containing 50,000 sectors, each of which held 100 six-bit alphanumeric characters, for a capacity of 5 million six-bit characters. Disks rotated at 1,200 rpm, tracks were recorded at up to 100 bits per inch, and typical head-to-disk spacing was 800 microinches (20 ¬µm). The execution of a \\"seek\\" instruction positioned a read-write head to the track that contained the desired sector and selected the sector for a later read or write operation. Seek time averaged about 600 milliseconds. Specifications of the original IBM 350 ‚Ä¢ Capacity: 5 million characters ‚Ä¢ Disks: 50 ‚Ä¢ Access time: 800 ms ‚Ä¢ Tracks per side: 100 ‚Ä¢ Area density: 2000 bit/in2 ‚Ä¢ Rotational speed: 1200 rpm Air-bearing head The magnetic disk drive consisted of a stack of closely spaced, magnetically coated disks mounted on a rotating shaft, with read-write heads that did not physically touch the storage surface. Goddard‚Äôs and Lynott's key innovation was the air-bearing head, which ‚Äúfloated‚Äù very close to the rotating disks without actually touching them, greatly increasing the speed of access. This air-bearing head, also known as a magnetic transducer, had the ability to move freely, which enabled the disk to be recorded and read from a vast number of different positions. The primary purpose of the air-bearing head was to allow the device to have rapid random access ability to any storage location. Additionally, the creation also allowed several magnetic discs to be mounted on a shaft in which a transducer could interact with more than one magnetic disk. Patents An invention disclosure, filed on December 14, 1954 by Lou Stevens, Ray Bowdle, Jim Davis, Dave Kean, Bill Goddard and John Lynott resulted in two US Patents, 3,134,997, \\"Data Storage Machine\\" to Stevens, Goddard and Lynott, claiming the RAMAC and subsequently 3,503,060, \\"Direct Access Magnetic Storage Disk Device\\" to Goddard and Lynott, claiming floating heads and disk drives in general. These patents make an analogy to how his invention acts hypothetically: ‚Äúthe operation may be compared with the manner in which skilled operators select cards from a card file index.‚Äù Evolution of the IBM 350 Modern Hard disk drives are similar to the IBM 350 Disk Storage Unit in many ways but there are two substantial differences in that modern drives have one head per surface whereas the IBM 350 had only two heads which moved between 50 surfaces and modern heads fly on an air bearing created by the rotating disks whereas the IBM 350 heads floated on compressed air forced between the head and the disk. Hard disk drives are used as the main components for storage on today‚Äôs computers. Hard disk drives have many times more storage capacity than the IBM 350 due to considerable innovations in areal densities on disks which at times was doubling every two years. Magnetic Disk Heritage Center The Magnetic Disk Heritage Center has played an active role in preserving RAMAC 350 units created by Johnson and his team at IBM. Originally located at Santa Clara University, the project was managed by Dr. Al Hoagland and a group of seniors at the university. Operations have since moved to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA. Goddard‚Äôs daughter, Bonnie Burham, is one of the organization‚Äôs major private donors. National Inventors Hall of Fame William Goddard was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame with John Lynott in 2007 for their contribution to the invention of the first magnetic disk drive. It is hailed as one of the most significant inventions in the computer industry and it has since emerged to become an industry of its own with an annual revenue of $22 billion worldwide.

Early life, education and family Stephens was born December 28, 1859 in Rahway, New Jersey, to Henry Louis Stephens and Charlotte Ann Wevil. He briefly attended Rutgers College in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) in 1875, where he studied under Thomas Eakins at various times between 1879 and 1885. He served as Eakins' teaching assistant beginning in 1880, and married Eakins' sister Caroline \\"Caddie\\" Eakins on June 14, 1884. They had three children, Margaret, Donald, and Roger. Caroline died after giving birth in 1889. Stephens' second marriage was to Elenor Getty on November 29, 1905; they had 10 children. Art career Following art school, Stephens formed a Philadelphia decorative arts business with classmates Colin Campbell Cooper, Jr., Jesse Godley, and Walter J. Cunningham. He worked for several years on the sculpture of Philadelphia City Hall, and was an instructor in modeling at several art schools, including the Drexel Institute. He was a member of the Philadelphia Sketch Club from 1881 until his death in 1935. =Accusations against Eakins= On February 9, 1886, Stephens accused brother-in-law Thomas Eakins of sexual misconduct with his PAFA students and with his deceased sister Margaret. The charges ignited such a controversy that Eakins was forced to resign from PAFA. Stephens, his cousin Charles Stephens, and Thomas Anshutz, all PAFA instructors, next took their accusations to the Philadelphia Sketch Club: \\"We hereby charge Mr. Thoms Eakins with conduct unworthy of a gentleman & discreditable to this organization & ask his expulsion from the club.\\"Kathleen A. Foster and Cheryl Leibold, Writing About Eakins (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989), p. 220. A committee investigated, concluding that: \\"Eakins has used his position as an artist and his authority as a teacher to commit certain trespasses on common decency and good morals.\\" His honorary membership in the club was revoked. The charges of sexual misconduct and incest were unproven,Henry Adams, Eakins Revealed (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 60. but Eakins's personal reputation was ruined, something from which he never totally recovered. Single-tax movement Stephens was influenced by the theories of Henry George, who argued in his 1879 publication Progress and Poverty for a more equitable distribution of wealth, through a single tax levied on the actual value of land irrespective of improvements a person might make. George platformed on this philosophy in his 1886 New York City mayoral bid, and despite losing was successful enough for a subsequent run. Stephens joined his campaign in 1895. Stephens first came to Delaware along with Will Price, a Philadelphia architect, in 1895-1896 during the single-tax campaign to win political control of the state. The single-taxers hoped that by gaining control of a small political entity they could put their principles into action and prove the legitimacy of Henry George's aims. Although the campaign failed ‚Äî many activists (including Stephens) were jailed ‚Äî but Price and Stephens did not give up their dream of creating a utopian community. Founding Arden, Delaware With the financial help of Joseph Fels, a wealthy soap manufacturer and single-tax proponent, Stephens purchased the Derrickson property, a farm six miles north of Wilmington on June 12, 1900. Price and Stephens named their newly founded community after the idyllic Forest of Arden from Shakespeare's As You Like It, and adopted \\"You are welcome hither\\" (a line from King Lear) as the community motto because they wanted the village to be a place open to people of all economic levels and political views. Along with their economic philosophy, Price and Stephens shared a belief in the principles of William Morris, John Ruskin, and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Morris, an Englishman, rebelled against modern cities and industry, advocating a return to craft production, good design, and village life. Price designed a town plan that provided communal open space, encouraged people to mingle with their neighbors, and preserved the woodlands along Naaman's Creek. Stephens continued to live and lead in Arden for three decades after its founding, earning the nickname \\"Patro\\" (a word meaning \\"Father\\" in Esperanto) by the villagers. He died June 16, 1935 at age 75 in Gilpin Point, Maryland (another Georgian community he had helped start).

Fran√ßois Modoux, \\"La Suisse engagera 300 millions pour r√©nover le Palais des Nations\\", Le Temps, Friday 28 June 2013, page 9. An international organization (intergovernmental organization) is an organization established by a treaty or other instrument governed by international law and possessing its own international legal personality, such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization and NATO. International organizations are composed of primarily member states, but may also include other entities, such as other international organizations. Additionally, entities (including states) may hold observer status. Notable examples include the United Nations (UN), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Council of Europe (COE), International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Police Organization (INTERPOL).\\"Intergovernmental organizations having received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly and maintaining permanent offices at Headquarters.\\" United Nations Department of Public Information, United Nations Secretariat.  History  The first and oldest intergovernmental organization - being established employing a treaty, and creating a permanent secretariat - is the International Telecommunication Union (founded in 1865). The first general international organization‚Äîaddressing a variety of issues‚Äîwas the League of Nations. The United Nations followed this model after World War II.  Purpose  The role of international organizations is helping to set the international agenda, mediating political bargaining, providing a place for political initiatives and acting as catalysts for the coalition- formation. They facilitate cooperation and coordination among member nations. In addition, they promote global initiatives aimed at reducing inequality like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10. Regional organizations International organizations typically have member states from the whole world, however in some cases organizations have geographic limitations, such as the European Union, African Union and NATO. The United Nations also has regional organizations, such as UNECE and UNECA. The oldest regional organization is the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine, created in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna.  United Nations Agencies  The United Nations organizes its work into agencies, such as United Nations Relief Works Agency, which are generally considered as international organizations in their own right. Additionally, the United Nations has Specialized Agencies which are organizations within the United Nations System, that have their member states (often nearly identical to the UN Member States) and are governed independently by them, examples include International Organizations that predate the UN, such the International Telecommunication Union, and the Universal Postal Union, as well as organizations that were created after the UN such as the World Health Organization (which was made up of regional organizations such as PAHO that predated the UN).  International NGOs  International organizations are sometimes referred to as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), to clarify the distinction from international non- governmental organizations (INGOs), which are non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that operate internationally. These include international nonprofit organizations such as the World Organization of the Scout Movement, International Committee of the Red Cross and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, as well as lobby groups that represent the interests of multinational corporations, such as the World Economic Forum.

A version without adult content was released under the title Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka: Parallel on July 31, 2008, by GN Software for the PlayStation 2. A port of this version of the game was released for the PlayStation Portable on December 17, 2009, under the title Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka: Portable. The gameplay in Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the six female main characters. Two light novels were produced in December 2007 and February 2008 written by different authors, and an Internet radio show began in April 2008. A manga adaptation began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's seinen magazine Comp Ace on June 26, 2008, illustrated by Homare Sakazuki. An anime adaptation produced by TNK and directed by Keitaro Motonaga aired in Japan between October and December 2008. Gameplay An average conversation in Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka featuring the main character talking to Tsukasa. Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. In the original version, there are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. This number increases to seven with the PlayStation 2 version. To view all the plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction. One of the goals of the gameplay from the PC version is for the player to enable the viewing of sex scenes depicting the protagonist, Jun'ichi, and one of the six heroines having sex. Plot Jun'ichi Nagase attends a prestigious high school. He has the nickname Geno Killer since he was rebellious in middle school. This is used, inadvertently, to help a girl named Yuuhi Katagiri from trouble. She later transfers to his school. Jun'ichi then kisses her due to a misunderstanding. Outraged, because he stole her first kiss and embarrassed her, she screams at him. Subsequently, it turns out that Yuuhi is his fianc√©e as arranged by their parents. Their parents discuss the matter and order them to go out together for a month to restore their relationship. If their relationship does not get better, the engagement will then be cancelled. Characters ; : (anime) :Jun'ichi is the main protagonist of the series and is a second year high school student.

They first meet when he saves her from some delinquents who were bothering her. The following day she is introduced as a transfer student to his class. Due to a misunderstanding, he kisses her in front of the class causing her opinion of Jun'ichi to sour. This is further exacerbated when it turns out that their families have arranged their marriage. Despite this rough start, Jun'ichi finds himself protecting Yuuhi when she is harassed and, as time progresses, their feelings for one another begin to grow even though neither of them will admit it. Throughout the anime series it is hinted that Jun'ichi has romantic feelings for his sister, Minato, but is reluctant to admit this even though he sometimes has fantasies about her.

It was developed by Emaar Properties to host a variety of performances and events including theatre, opera, ballet, concerts, conferences and exhibitions. Its plans were announced by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in March 2012 and it was completed in 2016. It opened on 31 August 2016 with a performance by Pl√°cido Domingo. The first season featured Bizet's The Pearl Fishers opera and also the legendary tenor Jos√© Carreras. Dubai Opera have flat floor capacity of 1800 square meters. This floor can be hired for weddings, gala dinners, fashion shows and exhibitions. Description Dubai Opera is part of The Opera District within Downtown Dubai. The 1901-seat performing arts centre was designed by Janus Rostock of Atkins. The theatre was conceived and briefed by Theatre Projects Consultants, it can be converted into a traditional theatre, concert hall, banquet hall or exhibition space. Using hydraulic lifts and seating wagons to relocate 900 of the 2,000 seats, the space can be used for other events while the extra seating is stored in garages beneath the theatre. Dubai Opera is designed to resemble a dhow, a traditional sailing vessel, in which the 'bow' of the structure houses the opera's main stage, orchestra and seating, while the elongated 'hull' has waiting areas, taxi drop-off areas, and parking. It also boasts a rooftop restaurant with views of the Burj Khalifa. Dubai Opera at night In January 2015, Emaar named Jasper Hope as the Chief Executive of Dubai Opera. Hope was the COO of London's Royal Albert Hall. Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC) was the main contractor for the development, having worked with Emaar in building the Dubai Mall. An earlier proposal to build a cultural centre on an island in the Dubai Creek designed by architect Zaha Hadid was announced in 2008 and shelved during the property crash in Dubai. This venue, located in The Lagoons, would have accommodated an opera house with a 2,500 seating capacity, an 800-seat playhouse, a 5,000-square-metre (54,000 sq ft) arts gallery, a performing arts school, and a '6-star' themed hotel. There is a free parking and paid parking for visitors of Dubai Opera. The Paid Parking is known as Green Parking. The first Emirati singer to appear at Dubai Opera was Hussain Al Jassmi on 10 October 2016. Shortly after that, the award winning hit musical Les Mis√©rables graced the stage for a 3 week run. In 2017 the venue staged the inaugural BBC Proms Dubai - just the second time ever that the United Kingdom's premier classical music series hosted events abroad in its 112 year history. Dubai Opera's longest running show was the Phantom of the Opera in late 2019. In just under 4 years of operating, Dubai Opera has won a number of awards including 'Best Theatrical Performance' at the Timeout Dubai Nightlife Awards 2017 for Les Mis√©rables, 'Favorite Show' at the 2017 What's On Awards Dubai for Les Mis√©rables, and 'Best Theatrical Performance' at the Timeout Dubai Music and Nightlife Awards 2019 for Othello. Recognition was also given at the Timeout Dubai Music and Nightlife Awards 2019 to Dubai Opera's Chief Executive Jasper Hope, where he was presented with the highly prestigious 'Outstanding Contribution' award. Other structures The Opera District was launched by Emaar Properties in Downtown Dubai in 2013. Aside from Dubai Opera, the district, which faces Burj Khalifa and The Dubai Fountain, includes art galleries, museums, design studios, and other cultural venues. The area includes several hotels, a retail plaza, recreational spaces and residential towers. Dubai has more than 50 art galleries and hosts cultural events such as Dubai Design Week, Art Dubai, and the SIKKA Art Fair.

His reporting was seen on NBC Nightly News, TODAY, NBCNews.com, and MSNBC. He also was a guest anchor on various MSNBC programs, including Andrea Mitchell Reports and Way Too Early.  Early life and career start  Russert is the son of newsman Tim Russert and his wife Maureen Orth, a special correspondent for Vanity Fair. Russert graduated from St. Albans School in Washington, D.C. in 2004. He worked for ESPN's Pardon the InterruptionXM Biographies while a student at Boston College, where he double-majored in Communications and History and graduated in 2008. Russert also co-hosted the sports talk program called 60/20 Sports on XM Satellite Radio with James Carville while at Boston College.  NBC career  Russert at the 2008 Democratic National convention In August 2008, just after his graduation from Boston College and a month after the death of his father, NBC News hired Russert as a correspondent covering youth issues as part of its coverage of the 2008 presidential election. He was assigned to cover both the Democratic and Republican conventions.\\"NBC News hires Luke Russert to cover Republican, Democratic Conventions\\", Daily News, July 31, 2008.\\"NBC Hires Luke Russert as a Correspondent\\", New York Times, July 31, 2008 His election day report, which explored the impact of Barack Obama's win on young people, contributed to NBC's News & Documentary Emmy award for its 2008 Election Night coverage. He has openly acknowledged that critics in the media, including some colleagues, have leveled accusations of unqualified nepotism, because of both his father's position at NBC and his mother's position as a Vanity Fair correspondent, given that he had virtually no professional experience at the time of his hiring. He stated that he merely attempts to ignore it. From May 2009 to July 2016, he worked for NBC News on Capitol Hill as a Congressional correspondent covering the House of Representatives. He made headlines in 2010 when he received a public apology from Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-NY), who was at the time serving as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman. Congressman Rangel had criticized Russert's aggressive questioning over an ethics report that showed Rangel's fiscal indiscretions and illegal donation solicitations, but then reversed his stance and apologized to Russert instead. In 2011, he also reported on Hurricane Irene for NBC News. In February 2012, Russert made his primetime debut on NBC's Dateline with \\"Conviction,\\" which examined whether the 1998 murder conviction of Jon-Adrian Velazquez was justified or whether Velazquez was wrongly sentenced to life imprisonment for a murder he didn't commit. The episode was nominated for a News & Documentary Emmy award for Best Report in a News Magazine. Russert has claimed that the American media is biased against people of religious faith, going so far as to suggest that it treats them with a certain degree of snark, labeling them as \\"puritanical\\" and \\"not understanding of others or of different viewpoints\\", which in his view is lazy and contributes to \\"[feeding] the snickering masses.\\" Russert hosted The Briefing, a web-only show on msnbc.com; he has said he likes to think of it as a \\"younger man's Charlie Rose\\". Russert suddenly resigned from NBC in July 2016, saying he needed to evaluate his career opportunities.  Personal life  Russert is involved with charitable causes that were supported by his late father. On April 20, 2010, he took the role of emcee of the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Washington's annual Congressional dinner, which was renamed after his father. He has told POLITICO that, as a sports junkie, he makes sure to watch ESPN's SportsCenter and College GameDay and NBC's Sunday Night Football. He also told POLITICO that his favorite watering holes in D.C. are Ireland's Four Fields in Woodley Park because its bartenders \\"pour a great Guinness, and on any given night you can catch some first-rate live music.\\" He also likes Billy Martin's Tavern in Georgetown because \\"you never know who you will be seated next to at the bar. It could be a cop coming off his shift, a college student or even a congressman.\\" He contributed an essay titled \\"What I Learned From My Dad\\" to Parade for its June 19, 2011 issue. Russert is a member of the Buffalo Fan Alliance Board, an organization committed to keeping the Buffalo Bills within the city of Buffalo, New York, the hometown of his father. In 2013, he said \\"I honestly think being a Bills fan is something that‚Äôs passed down into your blood. My grandfather was a die hard Bills fans and he passed it on to my dad. I was given a Buffalo Bills jersey when I was probably two years old, so there was really never any doubt that I‚Äôd be a Bills fan.\\" In 2014, he penned an introduction, dedicated to his father, for the tenth anniversary of his father's bestselling book Big Russ and Me.

The Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, under the command of General Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle, defeated the Chinese Guangxi Army and captured the strategically important town of L·∫°ng S∆°n in a ten-day campaign mounted under formidable logistical constraints.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 243‚Äì6  Campaign preparations, January 1885  The L·∫°ng S∆°n campaign, February 1885 French strategy in Tonkin was the subject of a bitter debate in the Chamber of Deputies in late December 1884. The army minister General Jean-Baptiste-Marie Campenon argued that the French should consolidate their hold on the Delta. His opponents urged an all- out offensive to throw the Chinese out of northern Tonkin. The debate culminated in Campenon's resignation and his replacement as army minister by the hawkish General Jules Lewal. On 5 January 1885 Lewal ordered Bri√®re de l'Isle to 'capture L·∫°ng S∆°n as soon as possible'.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 242‚Äì3 Long-range planning for a campaign against L·∫°ng S∆°n had been underway for several months, and Bri√®re de l'Isle had already assembled large French forces at the French forward base of Chu (now in B·∫Øc Giang Province) on the Luc Nam River, which had been occupied by the French in the wake of the Kep campaign (October 1884). On 3 and 4 January 1885 General de N√©grier attacked and defeated a substantial detachment of the Guangxi Army that had concentrated around the nearby village of N√∫i Bop to try to disrupt the French preparations. De N√®grier's victory at N√∫i Bop, won at odds of just under one to ten, was regarded by his fellow-officers as the most spectacular professional triumph of his career.Armengaud, 2‚Äì4; Bonifacy, 8‚Äì9; Dreyfus, 81‚Äì6; Harmant, 113‚Äì37; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 155‚Äì76; Vie militaire, 79‚Äì86; Maury, 129‚Äì32; Nicolas, 362‚Äì7; Sarrat, 169‚Äì70 Logistical arrangements for the L·∫°ng S∆°n campaign were formidable. It would take the column around ten days to advance to the outskirts of L·∫°ng S∆°n. The troops would be burdened with the weight of their provisions and equipment, and would have to march through extremely difficult country. The nights, in Tonkin in February, would be bitterly cold. Supplying the column with food and ammunition would tax the ingenuity of the marine infantry officers responsible for the mule trains and the coolies. It took the French a month to complete their preparations for the campaign, but by the end of January 1885, Bri√®re de l'Isle had assembled an expeditionary column of just under 7,200 troops, accompanied by 4,500 coolies, at Chu.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 177‚Äì206; Sarrat, 171‚Äì7  French high command, L·∫°ng S∆°n campaign  Image:Louis Briere de lIsle.jpgGeneral Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle (1827‚Äì96) Image:Fran√ßois Oscar de N√©grier.jpgGeneral Fran√ßois de N√©grier (1842‚Äì1913) File:Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli.jpgColonel Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli (1839‚Äì1903)  French order of battle  The L·∫°ng S∆°n expeditionary column (colonne exp√©ditionnaire de Lang-Son) was organised around the two brigades originally established by General Millot in January 1885. Each brigade contained two marching regiments (r√©giments de marche), each of two or three battalions, with supporting artillery and Tonkinese skirmishers, and was accompanied by field hospital and engineering detachments. Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade consisted of a two-battalion marine infantry regiment, a two-battalion regiment of Algerian riflemen (Turcos), a battalion of Tonkinese riflemen and three artillery batteries. De N√©grier's 2nd Brigade consisted of a 'French' regiment of three line infantry battalions from the metropolitan army, an 'Algerian' regiment of two Foreign Legion battalions and one battalion of African Light Infantry, a battalion of Tonkinese riflemen and three artillery batteries: *1st Brigade (Colonel Ange- Laurent Giovanninelli) **1st Marching Regiment (Lieutenant-Colonel Chaumont) ***marine infantry battalion (chef de bataillon Mahias) ***marine infantry battalion (chef de bataillon Lambinet) **2nd Marching Regiment (Lieutenant- Colonel Letellier) ***3rd Battalion, 3rd Algerian Rifle Regiment (chef de bataillon de Mibielle) ***4th Battalion, 1st Algerian Rifle Regiment (chef de bataillon Comoy) **1st Battalion, 2nd Tonkinese Rifle Regiment (chef de bataillon Tonnot) **Brigade artillery (chef d'escadron Levrard) ***3rd, 4th and 5th Marine Artillery Batteries bis (Captains Roussel, Roperh and P√©ricaud).Mahias's battalion consisted of the 25th, 29th, 34th and 36th Companies, 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Tailland, Salles, Hougnon and Bourguignon). Lambinet's battalion included the 25th A, 28th and 31st D Companies, 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Chanu, Herbin and de Damian) and a fourth, unidentified company (Lieutenant de l'√âtoile). De Mibielle's Turco battalion was the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Algerian Rifle Regiment (Captains Camper, Chirouze, Pol√®re and Valet).

The battalions which had served longest in the Tonkin campaign could only with difficulty field as many as 500 men, while Schoeffer and Comoy's recently arrived battalions could put 800 rifles into line.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 206  The L·∫°ng S∆°n campaign, February 1885  =Capture of Cao Nhiat, 3 February= Shortly after midnight on 2 February the expeditionary corps set off from Chu, with de N√©grier's 2nd Brigade leading the way, and advanced over the mountain of Deo Van to Cao Nhiat without meeting any enemy resistance. At Cao Nhiat the French captured an important Chinese rice dump, easing their supply difficulties.Armengaud, 7; Bonifacy, 13; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 227‚Äì30; Vie militaire, 107‚Äì12; Nicolas, 369 =Battle of Tay Hoa, 4 February= Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger (detail from a painting by Albert Bligny) Map of the battle of Tay Hoa, 4 February 1885 On 4 February the expeditionary corps fought its first action with the Chinese, at Tay Hoa. The battle was fought almost wholly by de N√©grier's 2nd Brigade, which was leading the march, and demonstrated the unfitness for field command of Lieutenant- Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger, the French commander who would in late March 1885 give the controversial order for the Retreat from L·∫°ng S∆°n. Ordered to capture the 'Great Fort', the key to the Chinese position, with his three French line battalions, Herbinger made an elaborate flank march which exhausted his troops and wasted valuable time. At length, seeing his operational timetable threatened, de N√©grier ordered Schoeffer's 3rd Legion Battalion to take the fort instead. The legionnaires scrambled rapidly up the mountain paths towards the Chinese position and captured it under Herbinger's nose. Meanwhile, on the other side of the battlefield, Captain Gravereau's company of Diguet's 2nd Legion Battalion was isolated and surrounded by the Chinese. The company was eventually disengaged by its comrades, but suffered heavy losses. Although the battle was indisputably a French victory, French casualties were disconcertingly heavy: 18 dead and 101 wounded, most of them in Diguet and Schoeffer's Legion battalions. These were the heaviest casualties the French had suffered in a single engagement since the start of the Sino-French War.Armengaud, 8‚Äì12; Bonifacy, 13‚Äì14; Harmant, 141‚Äì9; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 230‚Äì40; Vie militaire, 112‚Äì19; Maury, 134‚Äì7; Nicolas, 369‚Äì71 =Actions at Ha Hoa and Dong Song, 5 and 6 February= On 5 February the French assaulted the main complex of forts defending the Chinese entrenched camp at Dong Song, around Ha Hoa. The two French brigades attacked side by side. The 1st Brigade, on the left, overran a number of Chinese forts before their defenders could escape, and wiped out the garrisons by blowing in the roofs with dynamite. The 2nd Brigade, on the right, captured the principal Chinese work of Pins Parasols, so named because it had been built around a conspicuous clump of umbrella pines. The speed of the French attacks, prepared by artillery, kept the Chinese off balance throughout the battle, and French casualties were relatively low: 4 dead and 18 wounded.Armengaud, 12‚Äì14; Bonifacy, 14‚Äì15; Harmant, 149‚Äì50; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 241‚Äì50; Vie militaire, 120‚Äì4; Maury, 137‚Äì8; Nicolas, 371 On 6 February the French fought a morning action to clear the Chinese from their last defences before Dong Song, and took possession of the entrenched camp of Dong Song in the afternoon. French casualties in this action were 3 dead and 41 wounded. Bri√®re de l'Isle had been hoping to push the Chinese back across the mountain of Deo Quao into the Song Thuong valley, away from L·∫°ng S∆°n, but most of the Chinese troops fell back up the Dong Song valley to Pho Bu, where they could make a further stand for L·∫°ng S∆°n.Armengaud, 15‚Äì16; Bonifacy, 15; Harmant, 150; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 250‚Äì8; Vie militaire, 124‚Äì5; Maury, 138‚Äì42; Nicolas, 372‚Äì3 =Action at Deo Quao, 9 February= The capture of Dong Song threatened the supply line of the Guangxi Army's right wing at B·∫Øc L·ªá, and the Chinese hastily pulled back from B·∫Øc L·ªá and retreated up the Mandarin Road to Thanh Moy. To cover their retreat they attacked the French outposts on the mountain of Deo Quao on 9 February. The French units on Deo Quao easily repelled this attack, but the diversion allowed the Guangxi Army to regroup and make a final stand in front of L·∫°ng S∆°n.Armengaud, 16‚Äì19; Bonifacy, 16; Harmant, 150‚Äì1; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 273‚Äì6; Maury, 142‚Äì4 =Action at Pho Vy, 11 February= After a pause for breath at Dong Song to resupply with food and ammunition and to establish a shorter supply line back to Chu across the mountain of Deo Quan, the Tonkin expeditionary corps pressed on towards L·∫°ng S∆°n. On 11 February the 2nd Brigade, at the head of the French column, contacted advance elements of the Guangxi Army at Pho Vy. The Chinese were ejected from the village of Pho Vy by Herbinger's three French battalions with little difficulty, but they brought up their reserves and mounted a counterattack against Herbinger's regiment which forced de Negrier to commit Diguet's Legion battalion to drive them off. Towards the end of the battle the 111th Battalion stormed a Chinese hill position under the eyes of the rest of the brigade. 2nd Lieutenant Rene Normand, who fell a month later in the Battle of Bang Bo and whose letters from Tonkin were published after his death, distinguished himself in this action. Towards evening the Chinese fell back on their main body at Bac Vie. French casualties at Pho Vy were slight: a total of 1 dead and 23 wounded.Armengaud, 20‚Äì1; Harmant, 151‚Äì7; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 277‚Äì88; Maury, 144‚Äì50; Nicolas, 373‚Äì4; Normand, 106‚Äì15, 151‚Äì2, 166‚Äì7 and 190‚Äì3 =Battle of Bac Vie, 12 February= Map of the battle of Bac Vie, 12 February 1885 French troops advance on Chinese hill positions during the battle of Bac Vie The culminating battle for L·∫°ng S∆°n was fought on 12 February at Bac Vie, several kilometres to the south of L·∫°ng S∆°n. Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade was leading the French column, and de N√©grier's 2nd Brigade took little part in the battle. In a costly but successful assault, Giovanninelli's Turcos and marine infantry stormed the Chinese defences. The battle was fought in thick fog, allowing the Chinese to mount a dangerous counterattack at one point that nearly swept away part of Giovanninelli's brigade. Eventually the French broke through the Chinese centre, and the isolated Chinese wings retreated in disorder back to L·∫°ng S∆°n. French casualties at Bac Vie were 30 dead and 188 wounded, the highest casualties of the campaign. Most of these casualties were sustained by the two Turco battalions in Giovanninelli's brigade, which had borne the brunt of the battle. Chef d'escadron Levrard, the 1st Brigade's artillery commander, was shot dead during the battle, and Bri√®re de l'Isle's officier d'ordonnance 2nd Lieutenant Bossant, the son of a senior French general, was killed at Bri√®re de l'Isle's side.Armengaud, 21‚Äì4; Harmant, 157‚Äì8; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 288‚Äì98 and 304‚Äì5; Maury, 150‚Äì3; Nicolas, 374‚Äì8 =Capture of L·∫°ng S∆°n and action at Ky Lua, 13 February= On 13 February the French column entered L·∫°ng S∆°n, which the Chinese abandoned after fighting a token rearguard action at the nearby village of Ky Lua. In compliment to their performance at Bac Vie, Bri√®re de l'Isle gave Giovanninelli's Turcos and marine infantry the honour of leading the French entry into L·∫°ng S∆°n. The Guangxi Army fell back towards the Chinese border and occupied a strong defensive position at Dong Dang, a small town just in Tonkinese territory.Armengaud, 24‚Äì8; Bonifacy, 17‚Äì18; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 298‚Äì305; Vie militaire, 145‚Äì59, 161‚Äì77 and 179‚Äì86; Maury, 153‚Äì6; Nicolas, 378‚Äì80  Orders of the Day  Bri√®re de l'Isle issued two orders of the day during the L·∫°ng S∆°n campaign. The first, issued on 7 February, marked the capture of the Chinese entrenched camp of Dong Song: > Les formidables camps retranch√©s de Ha-Hoa et de Dong-Song sont entre vos > mains avec d'immenses approvisionnements d'armes, de munitions et de vivres > que votre √©lan n‚Äôa pas permis √† l'ennemi d'emporter.

Before his departure he ordered General de N√©grier, who would remain at L·∫°ng S∆°n with the 2nd Brigade, to press on towards the Chinese border and expel the battered remnants of the Guangxi Army from Tonkinese soil. After resupplying the 2nd Brigade with food and ammunition, De N√©grier advanced to attack the Guangxi Army at Dong Dang. On 23 February de N√©grier stormed the Chinese defences at Dong Dang, forcing the Chinese to retreat towards the Chinese border town of Longzhou (Lung-chou, ÈæçÂ∑û).Armengaud, 28‚Äì35; Bonifacy, 20‚Äì1; Dreyfus, 117‚Äì20; Grisot and Coulombon, 459‚Äì60; Harmant, 175‚Äì80; Lecomte, Lang- Son, 337‚Äì49; Maury, 159‚Äì72; Nicolas, 380‚Äì83; Normand, 122‚Äì34, 135‚Äì41 and 169‚Äì74 After clearing the Chinese from Tonkinese territory the French crossed briefly into Guangxi province and on 25 February blew up the 'Gate of China', an elaborate Chinese customs building on the border at Zhennan Pass (Zhennanguan). They were not strong enough to exploit this victory, however, and de N√©grier returned to L·∫°ng S∆°n with the bulk of the 2nd Brigade at the end of February. A small French garrison under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel Herbinger was left at Dong Dang to watch the movements of the Guangxi Army. Three weeks later the Chinese attacked the Dong Dang garrison, precipitating a series of events that led to a decisive French defeat at the Battle of Bang Bo (24 March 1885).

Abrams Inc., 2006. ‚ÄúFreight Train Graffiti‚Äù A synopsis of Falcon‚Äôs graffiti experience has been documented in the book The Art of Getting Over.Stephen Powers. St. Martin's Press, 1999. ‚ÄúThe Art of Getting Over‚Äù Upon graduating High School, Falcon attended Temple University and studied communications and journalism which enabled him to launch his writing career under the pseudonym, Buford Youthward, for On the Go magazine published by Stephen Powers. He maintained a monthly column from 1999 until 2014 under the pseudonym for the Art Crimes websiteArt Crimes-Byline http://www.graffiti.org/byline/index.html and was also interviewed in AdbustersKatie Haegele, Cat Burglars & Hustlers, Adbusters, Nov./Dec. 2001 under the assumed name. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1991 and served as a paratrooper for four years. =Music career= From an early age, Falcon had an interest in playing the guitar and after developing an affinity for rock and blues, moved on to swing and bebop, ultimately studying under Billy Bauer. While sharpening his skills, he managed a nightclub and worked as a retail promoter for Red Ant Records supporting diverse acts such as Cheap Trick, Ozzy Osbourne and Chick Corea. Young Werewolves Falcon formed the band in 2002 after meeting drummer Jonny Wolf and bonding over a mutual respect for the Flat Duo Jets. Tryouts were held to fill in the rest of the group, which included lead singers, alto sax players and bassists, and several auditions later the duo met bassist Shewolf Dana Kain, completing the line up. Falcon‚Äôs guitar style incorporates rockabilly, swing, and traditional rock while maintaining a clean sound with very limited use of effects, usually no more than reverb and vibrato. His main guitar is a 1988 Guild X-170 custom fit with a Bigsby and he uses a 1975 Fender Twin amplifier.

Since then, the new courthouse has moved to its existing location, across the street from the southeast corner of the park. During the Civil War, the park was used as a training ground for the militia. On the north end of the park, a well provided water to parched men and women with a trough for horses. In the early 1900s the Atlanta trolley system was extended to Marietta and the trolley would turn around by circling the park.

He is the son of the late talent manager Bob Herbert. Career With father Bob Herbert a music talent manager the young Chris Herbert grew up in music industry orientated environment that had a large influence on his eventual career direction. At the age of twenty-one Herbert approached his father for advice and assistance in setting up his own talent management company. Safe Corporation was founded as an independent music management company in March 1994. The first project the pair worked on was the creation of an all-girl pop group to cater to what he had identified as a potentially massive untapped market. =Spice Girls= By mid-1994, the Herberts and Chic Murphy had auditioned 600 applicants, and whittled the line-up down to Melanie Brown, Suzanne Tinker (replaced with Geri Halliwell), Victoria Adams, Lianne Morgan (replaced by Melanie Chisholm) and Michelle Stephenson (replaced by Emma Bunton). After a large amount of development in studios, the final group line- up felt insecure about the lack of a contract and frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. Chris Herbert set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers and A&R; men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush. Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for the group, but all five members delayed signing on legal advice. In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management, due to the lengthy development period, they parted from the Herbert's Heart Management. After signing an agreement with Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment, they released their first single in summer 1996. =Tulisa Contostavlos Sex tape= Herbert was the manager of Justin Edwards, also known as MC Ultra. With his career not gaining traction, in late 2011 Edwards advised Herbert that he had a sex tape of himself and ex-lover Tulisa Contostavlos, now a well-known singer and judge on the UK version of The X Factor. Herbert says that he advised Edwards not to release the tape, but by early 2012 Edwards had an agreement with others to distribute the tape. Herbert says that he advised Edwards not to do this, but negotiated a legal restraint clause with the contract Edwards signed as it was \\"career suicide\\". The tape was released to the press in March 2012. Contostavlos was quickly granted an injunction (Contostavlos v Mendahun) that legally blocks the distribution of the tape worldwide. The injunction prohibits anyone from using, publishing, communicating or disclosing all or any part of the film to any other person.

Ochoa de Olza took part in more than thirty separate climbing expeditions in the Himalayas over the course of his career, and he was involved in more than 200 expeditions as a guide. His records included climbing 12 of the world's 14 tallest mountains (repeating one of them, Cho Oyu) without the aid of oxygen. Ochoa went on record as saying that he did not believe in using oxygen to climb mountains, claiming \\"if you use oxygen, you are not an alpinist; you are more of an astronaut or a scuba diver.\\". He died of pulmonary edema in May 2008 while attempting to climb Annapurna (which would have been his 13th eight thousander). Mountaineering I√±aki Ochoa de Olza was born in Pamplona, Navarra, north of Spain, on May 29, 1967. He completed his first climb over 8,000 meters when he ascended to the peak of Kangchenjunga at the age of 22. He also worked as a high altitude guide and cameraman. His most recent achievements included a solo climb on a new route on Shishapangma in 2005. Aside from sports challenges, I√±aki Ochoa de Olza had another dream he wanted to achieve. He wanted to give back to the people who live in needy countries with mountains over 8,000 m part of what he had received during his life in these places. So, he wanted to raise funds to build an orphanage in Kathmandu, a children's hospital in Pakistan and a school in Dharamsala (home of the Tibetan exile). Unfortunately, he could not see his dream fulfilled because of his death on Annapurna. However, his goal of helping needy children continues today, through the Foundation I√±aki Ochoa de Olza - SOS HIMALAYA (www.soshimalaya.org). That is the legacy of I√±aki. In recognition of his sporting career he was awarded with the Gold Medal of Sports Merit of the Government of Navarre, his homeland. All the alpinists who contributed and took part in his rescue received the award as well.  Death  Ochoa de Olza died in 2008 while attempting to climb the Nepalese mountain, Annapurna. Ochoa was trying to climb to the peak of Annapurna with his climbing partner, Romanian alpinist Horia ColibƒÉ»ôanu. They were forced to halt their climb near the summit of the mountain because of dangerous weather conditions at the peak. Ochoa had also suffered severe frostbite to his hands, which also forced the duo to halt the climb. Upon their descent back down the mountain, Ochoa collapsed and suffered a seizure near Annapurna's Camp 4. He and his partner were unable to descend any further due to Ochoa's sudden illness and incapacitation. Ochoa suffered from lung and brain damage due to the seizure. His condition was further complicated by pulmonary edema. Attempts were made to save Ochoa's life. Swiss climber Ueli Steck, who had abandoned his own attempt with Simon Anthamatten to climb Annapurna's south face due to avalanche threat the previous week, climbed to Ochoa's position to administer emergency medical aid. Doctors from the Hospital of Navarre also tried to help Ochoa remotely from Pamplona. However, heavy snow conditions and the high altitude made all rescue attempts impossible. (Rescues above 7400 metres are usually impossible because helicopters cannot hover at that altitude and few people are able to handle the altitude.) Steck and Colibasanu were left to administer first aid to Ochoa. I√±aki Ochoa de Olza died on May 23, 2008, at 6:45 a.m. GMT in an emergency tent on Annapurna, where he had been trapped in a semiconscious and immobile state for five days. He died from a suspected pulmonary edema, as well as a brain lesion, according to the Spanish newspaper, Diario de Navarra. His body still remains there, at 7,400 meters in the Annapurna, as per his family's request.

At the age of fourteen he joined the Spanish Army as a soldier during the War of the Second Coalition and quickly distinguished himself and four years later he joined the Guardia de Corps. He fought well during the Spanish War of Independence, reaching the level of colonel by 1814. The following year he was assigned to the military expedition to South America led by Pablo Morillo, and participated in the Spanish reconquest of New Granada. Promoted to brigadier after New Granada was subdued, La Torre led a royalist army into the Colombian and Venezuelan Llanos. There he unsuccessfully defended Angostura against Manuel Piar in April 1817, and led the loyalist forces down the Orinoco River as they fought their way to the Atlantic Ocean. For the next three years he continued to serve in the Spanish army of Venezuela. During this period he married a Criolla, Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n Vegas y Rodr√≠guez del Toro, a member of the powerful Rodr√≠guez del Toro family and cousin once removed to Bol√≠var's late wife, Maria Teresa Rodr√≠guez del Toro y Alayza, and fourth cousin to Bol√≠var himself. After the restoration of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 in 1820, the government appointed him governor (jefe pol√≠tico superior) and captain- general of Venezuela, a post he held until 1822. He participated in the negotiations between Bol√≠var and Morillo and the later meeting in Santa Ana, where the two signed a six-month truce and a treaty regularizing the rules of engagement. After Morillo resigned and left Venezuela at the end of 1820, La Torre became the head of the royalist army, in addition to his other duties. As such he oversaw the loss suffered by royalist forces at the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821, which effectively ended Spanish control of Venezuela. The following year he was replaced in his offices by Francisco Tom√°s Morales. Puerto Rico In 1822, the government appointed him captain general of Puerto Rico, arriving on the island in December 1823. The following year he was also appointed governor of the island. In collaboration with his intendant, Dr. Jos√© Domingo D√≠az, whom he knew from his days in Venezuela, La Torre's main concern was preventing a rebellion on the island. Carefully controlling the government, he instituted a policy which he called \\"dance, drink and dice\\" (baile, botella y baraja, similar to the Romans \\"bread and circuses\\"), implying that a well entertained population will not think about revolution. Despite La Torre's wariness of the island's liberal tendencies, his long administration was key to the development of large-scale sugar production on the island, something which had been created decades earlier in Cuba. He also continued supporting from Puerto Rico the few royalist guerrilla bands that existed in Venezuela. Under his watch, roads, homes, bridges, and Spanish fortifications were constructed. As governor and captain general, he oversaw the temporary restoration of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 in 1836, while a new constitution was written. He was also made the Count of Torrepando for his services. The following year he retired from public life and settled in Madrid. Legacy In Ponce, Puerto Rico there is a street, Calle Simon de la Torre (aka, Calle Torre), leading to Pante√≥n Nacional Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro which is named after him.

Preparation and properties The alkali metal naphthalenides are prepared by stirring the metal with naphthalene in an ethereal solvent, usually as tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxyethane. The resulting salt is dark green. The anion is a radical, giving a strong EPR signal near g = 2.0, with a reduction potential near -2.5 V vs NHE. Its deep green color arises from absorptions centered at 463, 735 nm. Several solvates of sodium naphthalenide have been characterized by X-ray crystallography.

When a piece of meat is roasted, pan-fried, or prepared in a pan with another form of dry heat, a deposit of browned sugars, carbohydrates, and/or proteins forms on the bottom of the pan, along with any rendered fat. The French culinary term for these deposits is sucs, ), from the Latin word succus (sap). The meat is removed and the majority of the fat is poured off, leaving a small amount with the dried and browned meat juices. The pan is returned to the heat, and a liquid such as vegetable or meat stock, a spirit, some wine, or verjuice is added to act as a solvent. Dairy, however, is not recommended for deglazing, as it may curdle when added to high heat. The solvent allows the cook to scrape the dark spots from the bottom of the pan and dissolve them, incorporating the remaining browned material at the bottom of the pan into a basic sauce. The culinary term fond, French for \\"base\\" or \\"foundation\\", refers to this sauce, although it is also sometimes used to describe the browned food bits instead (commonly in the United States). Burned pieces should not be confused with fond, which is dark brown. The flavour is determined chiefly by the meat, the liquid used for deglazing, and any flavouring or finishing ingredients added, such as aromatics, herbs, or butter. This method is the cornerstone of many well-known sauces and gravies. The resulting liquid can be seasoned and served on its own (sometimes called a jus), or with the addition of aromatic vegetables, such as onions or shallots, carrots, and celery, or used as the base for a soup. The sauce can also be thickened by whisking in butter, through the addition of a starch, such as flour, cornstarch, or arrowroot, or simply simmered down with a steady heat to form a rich, concentrated reduction. Deglazing can also be used while cooking vegetables, especially ones which have left sugars at the bottom of a pan. It is commonly used in caramelizing onions. Because vegetables do not produce as much fat, they do not need to be removed from the pan to pour off excess grease. Instead, the liquid can be added directly to the pan and stirred, allowing the fond to meld with the vegetables, rather than creating a separate sauce.

His rebuttal to Thomas Frank's What's the Matter with Kansas?, entitled What's the matter with What's the matter with Kansas was published in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science in 2006. While Frank asserts that the conservative Republican Party has been able to lure working class voters away from the liberal Democratic Party, which better represents their economic interests, with value issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, Bartels points out that the working class, despite being socially more conservative, is still overwhelmingly Democratic, more so than in the past.Krugman, Paul (2007). The Conscience of a Liberal. New York: W. W. Norton. In his empirical analysis, Bartels finds that both college graduates and working-class people are mostly Democratic, the former having become more Democratic over the past years. He attributes the gain made by Republicans to the loss of the Solid South, with middle and high income whites from Southern states standing out as having become more Republican.Bartels, L. M. (2008). Unequal democracy: The political economy of the new gilded age. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. Bartels studied the voting patterns of the US Senate and correlated it with the responsiveness to the opinions of different amounts of Income in the United States.Based on Larry Bartels's study Economic Inequality and Political Representation , Table 1: Differential Responsiveness of Senators to Constituency Opinion. In his 2008 book, Unequal Democracy: The political economy of the new gilded age, Bartels demonstrates that income inequality expanded under Republican presidential administrations and narrowed under Democratic presidential administrations since the early 1970s, when income inequality first started to expand. Under Republican presidents, rich families saw substantial net gains in their income, while poorer families saw negligible gains, producing a significant net increase in income inequality. By contrast, under Democratic presidents, poor families did slightly better than rich families proportionally, lessening income inequality. However, all income brackets, from the bottom 20% to the top 5% of the population, saw significantly greater increases in income under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents. In other words, had Democratic presidents been in office since the 1970s, income inequality may have lessened since the 1950s instead of growing into what Bartels calls \\"The New Gilded Age\\" of the early 21st century. Bartels's findings led him to conclude that \\"economic inequality is, in substantial part, a political phenomenon.\\"Unequal democracy: The political economy of the new gilded age.

Details In a gasoline or diesel engine, the pistons ride up and down within the engine maintaining a tight seal via the piston rings. Over time, the constant rubbing of the rings against the cylinder wall can polish it to a very smooth finish. This creates problems in two ways. First, the lubricating oil in the engine will not adhere properly to the smooth surface, and in the absence of an oil film the resulting friction is increased. Secondly, while breaking in newly installed piston rings, a minute amount of wear must occur between rings and cylinder wall in order to seat the rings properly, and ensure a gas-tight seal. If the cylinder walls are too smooth, this wear will not occur, with the rings \\"skating\\" over the polished surface. In order to correct the situation, a mechanic can take the engine apart, and deglaze the cylinders, usually using an abrasive. This creates a roughly 45 degree angle crosshatching of tiny grooves in the cylinder wall, and restores the engine's performance. Crosshatching that deviates too far from 45 degrees can either cause an unwanted accumulation of oil or be unable to hold on to the oil entirely.

He is the current co-lead singer of the classic rock band Grand Funk Railroad. In addition, he spent several years as the keyboardist and lead singer for the southern rock band 38 Special, for whom he co-wrote and sang lead on the hit song \\"Second Chance\\". Early life Carl was born in 1950 in Platte Center, Nebraska, and raised near the town of Humphrey, graduating from high school in Norfolk, Nebraska in 1968. Throughout 1968‚Äì69, he played a significant role as a member of the Norfolk-based New Breed Blues Band, during which time he enhanced his interest in rhythm and blues music. Beginning as a saxophonist in this band, he later became the lead vocalist/keyboardist in the group. However, in 1969, he left to join the Lincoln-based Chancellors. Developing musical skills During the 1970s, Carl served stints with numerous bands across the Midwest, including The Fabulous Flippers out of Lawrence, Kansas, pausing briefly in 1976 to study piano and refine and improve his songwriting abilities in Oklahoma City. He frequently performed with fellow Midwesterner Tommy Bolin in various jazz/rock fusion groups. By the late-1970s, Carl had graduated to performing on albums by \\"bigger names,\\" such as Rod Stewart and Dusty Springfield. Around this time, Carl decided to begin recording as a solo artist. His debut album, Whistling in the Dark was released in 1979 under his given name, Max Gronenthal. A second solo album, Max followed in 1980.  Professional career  Throughout the 1980s, Carl immersed himself in session work, singing and/or playing on albums by artists such as Elton John, Dan Fogelberg, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Timothy B. Schmit, Bette Midler, and Kenny Loggins. In 1982, he also formed what started as a '60s' R&B; cover band, eventually named Jack Mack and the Heart Attack. Featuring a four-piece horn section, the band played classic R&B;, Soul and also incorporated some Max Carl-penned original R&B-styled; songs into their repertoire, including the classic \\"Cardiac Party.\\" Their Thursday night residency at the Club Lingerie in Hollywood was legendary. After Max Carl left the band, Jack Mack was no longer a ‚Äúcover band,‚Äù became the Late Show band, and appeared in many tv shows and movies, including the cult classic, ‚ÄúTuff Turf.‚Äù (This year, Jack Mack and the Heart Attack celebrated its 37th Anniversary entertaining the world and writing much music, and released its most recent album ‚ÄúBack to the Shack‚Äù in 2017. Like the band‚Äôs previous albums, Back to the Shack features music written by original members Bill Bergman and Andrew Kastner, along with Mark Campbell, the singer who took Carl‚Äôs place in 1984.) In addition to performing, Carl also found time during the mid-1980s to compose tunes for various movie soundtracks, performing on many of them as well. Films such as Spring Break (1983), Police Academy (1984), Grandview, U.S.A. (1984), Tuff Turf (1985), and Doin' Time (1985) include his compositions. In 1986, he would co-write \\"Come and Follow Me\\" as a duet with Marcy Levy (Marcella Detroit), which played during the closing credits of the movie Short Circuit. He also performed the theme song to the 1987 animated series Spiral Zone. Meanwhile, in 1984, Carl left Jack Mack and the Heart Attack to record his third solo album. Unlike the first two solo albums, The Circle would be released under his stage name Max Carl. The album's title track would be included on the soundtrack for the John Hughes film Weird Science. Later that same year, Carl was invited to join .38 Special, a request that he eventually accepted. Carl rehearsed with the band frequently, and by 1988, he joined forces with the southern rock stylings of .38 Special. That year, the band would release the Rock & Roll Strategy album, which included the Cal Curtis/Jeff Carlisi tune that Carl reworked (earning him an additional writing credit) into \\"Second Chance,\\" featuring Carl on lead vocals. \\"Second Chance\\" introduced .38 Special into a whole new market, when it reached the top of the Adult Contemporary chart in early 1989. Carl remained in .38 Special into the 1990s, but left shortly after the release of the band's Bone Against Steel album in 1991. At this point, Carl moved to Nashville, where he continued to write/perform on tunes for the likes of Joe Cocker, Bad Company, Richard Marx, and Charlie Daniels. Later in the '90s, he became fascinated with a \\"family\\" of musicians in Mississippi who performed a very original historical and heartland-infused brand of music. Relocating to Mississippi, Carl began performing with this group of musicians, forming what would become Max Carl and the Big Dance. This experience ultimately culminated in the release of the album One Planet ‚Äì One Groove (under the \\"Max Carl and the Big Dance\\" moniker) in 1998. Featured on this album are several of Carl's original compositions fused with this new \\"southern funk\\"/\\"Mississippi sound,\\" as well as covers of various 60s hits done in this style. Carl remains with Grand Funk, but reunites on rare occasions with Jack Mack and the Heart Attack Band, whom are still performing together to this day. A new album (from Jack Mack), Live from Centennial Park - Atlanta 1996 is due to be released on December 6, 2019 and the band is planning a celebration of their 40th anniversary in 2020. Miscellaneous In addition to the artists already mentioned, he has performed with artists as diverse as James Brown, Otha Turner, and Jennifer Warnes, (Somewhere - Somebody) among others. Carl was the original lead singer for the band Jack Mack and the Heart Attack. It was Jack Mack and the Heart Attack band that was performing in Atlanta, Georgia, during the 1996 Summer Olympics when a pipe bomb detonated nearby, killing one woman, causing the fatal heart attack of a journalist and injuring 111 people. At the Olympic Bombing concert in Atlanta, Max Carl had already left the Jack Mack band (then singing for .38 Special). The new lead singer for Jack Mack and the Heart Attack during the Olympic concert was TC Moses. Carl's current work is on the Speed Channel's grassroots drag racing competition Pinks franchise. He is the composer and performer of the theme music as well as transitional music throughout the show. Through this endeavor, he has released a CD soundtrack for the show entitled Max Carl: Fuel, produced by Max & Steve Music, LLC.

Mamet addresses the book \\"To the Jews‚Ä¶whose favorite Jew is Anne Frank‚Ä¶who bow the head reverently at a baptism and have never attended a bris ‚Äì to you, who find your religion and race repulsive, your ignorance of your history a satisfaction, here is a book from your brother.\\" Mamet confronts his readers: \\"The world hates Jews. ... The world hates you.\\" Summary In the Passover Seder, four different sons ask a question. The wicked son asks, \\"What does this ritual mean to you?\\", in essence separating himself from the group by sarcastically and scornfully declaring that the ritual has no personal meaning for him. In a series of related essays, Mamet uses this concept of the wicked son as a symbol of the atheistic or agnostic self-hating Jew in Western society. =Israel= Mamet gives his own personal, unapologetic explanation of Israel's situation. He declares that \\"The Jewish State has offered the Arab world peace since 1948; it has received war, and slaughter, and the rhetoric of annihilation.\\" He notes that \\"It is a country, and like any country, will make mistakes.\\" Yet as Mamet sees it, Israel is \\"not by proof, but by the mere process of indictment, excluded from the family of humankind.\\" Unlike more familiar defenses such as those by Alan Dershowitz in The Case for Israel, Mamet focuses on what he sees as the anti-Semitic psychology and underlying double standards of attacks on Israel. He sees the media portrayal of Israel as \\"a modern instance of the blood libel - that Jews delight in the blood of others.\\" For example, he writes: \\"The everyday announcements of the so-called 'cycle of violence' in Israel are race slander, a pro-forma reminder of the availability of the Jews as an object of disgust.\\" He sees anti-Semitism in \\"the inability to assign to Israelis a basic humanity‚Ä¶the happy assignment of wicked motives to the Israeli soldier.\\" He underlines the double standard of anti-Semitism: \\"‚Ä¶'reprisals'‚Ä¶'retaliation'‚Ä¶the very words are revelatory, for such actions by the United States are known as 'defense'‚Ä¶\\" =Jewish identity= Mamet goes on to analyze what happens when Jews abandon loyalty to their religion and tradition in order, as he sees it, to find acceptance in a liberal society antagonistic to Israel. \\"It is the sin of the spies, a 'coward generation' with a 'lack of belief in God.' People have a drive to worship something, and will fill the void left by rejecting God by worshipping sports, celebrities, 'wealth, fame, status, sex, physical fitness, good works, human perfectibility.\\" In the lavish bar mitzvah, Mamet sees the sin of the golden calf: \\"in the absence of God, lapsed Jews worship Man, power, gold. It is self-worship, the idolatry of human power.\\" \\"Our own enclave, the Jews, exists, in truth, in learning, containing wisdom, solace, tradition, and mutual support.\\" \\"Secular Jews reject their birthright of 'connection to the Divine.'\\" \\"(Our religion) is a gift from God ‚Äì what greater joy than to support it, to devote ourselves to it, and to enjoy it?\\" References =Bibliography= * Reviews *David Margolick, Maybe I Am Chopped Liver, (Review of The Wicked Son), New York Times, November 5, 2006. *Abigail Radoszkowicz, Rites and wrongs, Jerusalem Post, November 16, 2006. *Shaun Smith, The only good Jew is a very angry Jew, Toronto Star, April 1, 2007 *Tom Teicholz, David Mamet has one question‚Äîfor the wicked son, The Jewish Journal, November 9, 2006 Category:2006 non-fiction books Category:Books by David Mamet ","title":"The Wicked Son"},{"id":"18202198","text":"S√°r√°n mac C√≥elbad (flourished circa third quarter of 5th century) was a Dal nAraide king in the time of Saint Patrick.

During her period as President-Elect (2004‚Äì2005), Mich√®le centred her efforts with the review of the FDI governance and finances. Consequently, the new governance was adopted and the constitution adapted. Under her Presidency, the FDI made had a positive balance sheet for the first time in ten years. During her presidency, Mich√®le Aerden decided to be focus on 3 issues: # Excellency # Medical Positioning of the dental profession # Ethics 1) Excellency Excellency at all levels of the organization; the FDI has performed exceptionally well during her tenure. The Annual World Dental Congresses organized by the FDI were very successfully. Policy Statements were reviewed, improved and renewed. During the General Assembly of 2007, the FDI decided to implement the World Oral Health Day, which will be held on 12 September each year. As President, Mich√®le Aerden gave a new positioning to the FDI President‚Äôs role. During each of her visits in nearly 60 countries, she consistently met the President of the country or the Prime Minister, and the Ministers of Health and sometimes Minister of Education in order to advocate for a strategy of Oral Health integrated into the strategy of General Health through prevention, planning and budget. ‚ÄúNo general health without oral health !!‚Äù was her leitmotiv. She obtained tangible results during those visits and always received large media coverage. 2) Medical Positioning of the Profession Mich√®le Aerden is convinced that it is necessary to increase the recognition of the dental profession as a fully medical profession. Twice she introduced a candidate of the dental field for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. In 2007, for the first time in 26 years, a resolution concerning Oral health was on the agenda of the WHO. The resolution was adopted on 23 May 2007 by the 191 countries member of the WHO and the Director general of WHO, Dr Chan, recognized the urgency to acknowledge oral diseases and their impact on the socio-economic development of a country. 3) Ethics Ethics are the foundation to the success of the dental profession and organisations. Without ethics, there's no trust nor credibility. It's under her presidency that the FDI launched the first ‚ÄúDental Ethics Manual‚Äù. The FDI also launched conferences tackling ethics and its role in international health NGOs. Travelling around the globe with the message ‚ÄòNo general health without oral health¬ª allows Mich√®le Aerden to meet and collaborate with exceptional personalities beyond the dental world: Professor Muhammad Yunus (micro credits) Dr Bertrand Piccard (ballooner) Madame WU Yi, (vice-President China Republic of people) Michelle Bachelet (President of Chilli) etc. Through her 20 years of activities with the FDI, and certainly in the last two years as president, the contribution of Mich√®le Aerden to improving the quality of life and well-being of hundred of millions of people is recognized by her peers with numerous awards and also by the FDI partners and the dental industry.

It lies on the north side of Taui Bay, between Amakhton Bay to the west and Nagaev Bay to the east. It is about west of the city of Magadan. Nedorazumeniya Island lies off the coast and is roughly triangular in shape. It is long and has a maximum width of about . On Nedorazumeniya's northeastern headland there is a settlement called Ribachiy. Administratively Nedorazumeniya Island belongs to the Magadan Oblast of the Russian Federation. Etymology The name of the island is remarkable. \\"Nedorazumeniye\\" in Russian means \\"misunderstanding\\", \\"error\\". The island got such a strange name because it was originally not mapped by a Russian expedition in the 1910s. Then the mistake was identified and corrected.

They called the island Fabius Island, while the anchorage was called Fabius Harbor. Both features are named after the ship Fabius (432 tons), of New Bedford, which frequented Taui Bay in the early 1850s. A graveyard existed on the north side of the island.Lancaster, of New Bedford, Aug. 26, 1853, ODHS; Daniel Wood, of New Bedford, July 4, 1855, NWC. Boats also spent the night on the island after cruising for bowhead whales all day.Daniel Wood, of New Bedford, Aug. 19, 1854, NWC. A temporary whaling station was established on the island by two American vessels in the summer of 1858. It only consisted of a tent of sails, a thatched cook house, and a small tryworks. Sixteen men, eight from each ship, were given provisions for two months and worked on shares while the ships cruised to the south.Sharon left the island on July 25 and returned on September 18, 1858, while Cicero left and returned on July 19 and October 1, 1858, respectively. Among them were the second mates from both vessels, two boatsteerers (harpooners), a carpenter, a cook, and a steward. With two whaleboats they searched for bowhead and gray whales for as long as four days, ranging west to near the Taui River, east to Ola, and south to \\"Jeffrey's Point\\" (Mys Taran). They regularly cruised off \\"Jeanette Point\\" (Mys Chirikova) and often visited \\"Dobry Town\\" (probably Arman). Whales were also spotted by two men atop the island. They fished for salmon in the rivers at high water and dug for clams at low water. The men encountered bears on several occasions as well. They also traded meat and salmon for bread with other foreign whaleships. When they caught a whale, it was towed ashore, flensed at low tide, and the blubber rendered into oil using a single trypot. In the fall the men and their catch were picked up by their respective vessels.Sharon, of Fairhaven, July 14-September 30, 1858, NWC.Cicero, of New Bedford, July 15-19, October 1, 1858, ODHS.

The dyers of Lincoln, known for colouring wool with woad (Isatis tinctoria) to give it a strong blue shade, created the eponymous Lincoln green by overdying this blue wool with yellow weld (Reseda luteola)Reseda luteola. or dyers' broom, Genista tinctoria.Stefan's Florilegium. Other colours like \\"Coventry blue\\" and \\"Kendal green\\" were linked to the dyers of different English towns. Lincoln green is often associated with Robin Hood and his Merry Men in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire.The Child Ballads 117 A Gest of Robyn Hode (c 1450) \\"Whan they were clothed in Lyncolne grene\\" History The first recorded use of Lincoln green as a colour name in English was in 1510. By the late sixteenth century, Lincoln green was a thing of the past. Michael Drayton provided a sidenote in his Poly-Olbion (published 1612): \\"Lincoln anciently dyed the best green in England.\\"Noted in Robert Nares, James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps and Thomas Wright, A Glossary, Or, Collection of Words, Phrases, Names and Allusions... (1901), s.v. \\"Lincoln green\\". Cloth of Lincoln green was more pleasing than undyed shepherd's gray cloth: \\"When they were clothed in Lyncolne grene they kest away their gray\\", according to A Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode, ca 1510,Noted in The Journal for Weavers, Spinners, and Dyers, 158 (April 1991). and Lincoln green betokened an old-fashioned forester even in the fancy dress of Edmund Spenser's The Faery Queene: > \\"All in a woodman's jacket he was clad > of Lincolne Greene, belay'd with silver lace.\\" Robin Hood's Garland, the popular ballad printed in eighteenth-century compilations, offers an unexpected picture of Robin as he presented himself at court: > He cloathed his men in Lincoln green > And himself in scarlet red\\"Nares 1901. The distinction was in the cost of scarlet, which was dyed with kermes, derived from the Kermes vermilio insect native to the Mediterranean. Lincoln scarlet, from its imported dyestuff, was more expensive than Lincoln green. In 1198 the Sheriff of Lincoln bought ninety ells (about 112 yards) of scarlet cloth for ¬£30 (6s 8d per ell); although the cloth was a finely finished fabric, its high price was almost certainly due mainly to the extremely costly dye-stuff, greyne (graine)Graine is the dye-stuff, linguistically unrelated to \\"green\\". from Kermes or scarlet grain. In 1182 the Sheriff of Lincoln bought Scarlet at 6s 8d/ell, Green and Blanchet both at 3s/ell and Gray at approximately 1s 8d/ell. By 1216 three guilds controlling the cloth trade were established in Lincoln, the Weavers', Dyers', and Fullers' guilds.Sir Francis Hill, Medieval Lincoln, 1948, from a publication of the Pipe Roll Society; noted at Stefan's Florilegium. Modern survivals \\"Lincoln-green\\" was revived in the years prior to the Great War (World War I), when it was adopted as the colour of the full-dress uniform of the Lincolnshire Yeomanry. This military version took the form of a distinctively light shade, which contrasted sharply with the sombre rifle green widely worn by other regiments of the British Army.R.G. Harris, colour plate 11 and text, 50 Years of Yeomanry Uniforms, Frederick Muller Ltd 1972, SBN 584 10937 7 Lincoln-green was also worn as the facing colour on the scarlet tunics of the Sherwood Foresters Regiment from 1913.W.Y.

William Makepeace Thackeray in his 1848 novel Vanity Fair mentioned Lincoln green in Chapter III: \\"What causes them to labour at piano-forte sonatas, and to learn four songs from a fashionable master at a guinea a lesson, and to play the harp if they have handsome arms and neat elbows, and to wear Lincoln Green toxopholite hats and feathers, but that they may bring down some \\"desirable\\" young man with those killing bows and arrows of theirs?\\" The colour appears used in the dystopian novel Shades of Grey 1: The Road to High Saffron by Jasper Fforde, in which shades of green‚Äîand Lincoln green in particular‚Äîhave narcotic effects.Jasper Fforde, Shades Of Grey, 2009, noted at .

These plants have traditional uses in Chinese herbal medicine. The pharmaceutical industry has synthetically produced the more potent enantiomer Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (Levo-THP), which has been marketed worldwide under different brand names as an alternative to anxiolytic and sedative drugs of the benzodiazepine group and analgesics such as opiates. It is also sold as a dietary supplement. In 1940, a Vietnamese scientist Sang Dinh Bui extracted an alkaloid from the root of Stephania rotunda with the yield of 1.2 - 1.5% and he named this compound rotundine. From 1950 to 1952, two Indian scientists studied and extracted from Stephania glabra another alkaloid named hyndanrine. In 1965, the structure of rotundine and hyndarin was proved to be the same as tetrahydropalmatine.  Effects  Tetrahydropalmatine has been demonstrated to possess analgesic effects and may be beneficial in the treatment of heart disease and liver damage. It is a blocker of voltage-activated L-type calcium channel active potassium channels. It is a potent muscle relaxant. It has also shown potential in the treatment of drug addiction to both cocaine and opiates, and preliminary human studies have shown promising results. The pharmacological profile of l-THP includes antagonism of dopamine D1, and D2 receptors as well as actions at dopamine D3, alpha adrenergic and serotonin receptors. The Ki values for l-THP at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are approximately 124 nM (D1) and 388 nM (D2). In addition to the antagonism of post-synaptic dopamine receptors, the blockade of pre- synaptic autoreceptors by l-THP results in increased dopamine release, and it has been suggested that lower affinity of l-THP for D2 receptors may confer some degree of autoreceptor selectivity. Along with dopamine receptors, l-THP has been reported to interact with a number of other receptor types, including alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, at which it functions as an antagonist, and GABA-A receptors, through positive allosteric modulation. Additionally, l-THP displays significant binding to 5-HT1A and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. In the case of 5-HT1A receptors, l-THP binds with a Ki of approximately 340 nM. Animal experiments have shown that the sedative effect of THP results from blocking dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system where it occurs in several important signaling systems that regulate muscular activity and attention, as well as feelings of joy, enthusiasm, and creativity. Therefore, THP causes no feelings of euphoria, and has been seen as an alternative to addictive drugs for people suffering from anxiety and pain, and as a possibility for relief for people not helped by existing drugs.  Cases of poisoning  Several cases of poisoning related to THP have been reported. These cases involved negative effects on respiration, cardiac activity, and the nervous system. In addition, chronic hepatitis has been reported, caused by THP production in East Asia under conditions that were insufficiently sterile. Fatalities started to be reported in 1999 in cases where THP had been used in combination with other drugs having analgesic and anti-anxiety effects. All 1999 deaths could be tied to a single THP-based supplement, sold under the name \\"Jin Bu Huan Anodyne Tablets\\". This product was therefore blacklisted by US and European health authorities. In some other countries, such as Singapore, THP is treated as a controlled substance, and license is required to sell it.

The treatise is only a fraction of what was a longer work. Propositions =Proposition one= The circle and the triangle are equal in area. Proposition one states: The area of any circle is equal to a right-angled triangle in which one of the sides about the right angle is equal to the radius, and the other to the circumference of the circle. Any circle with a circumference c and a radius r is equal in area with a right triangle with the two legs being c and r. This proposition is proved by the method of exhaustion. =Proposition two= Proposition two states: > The area of a circle is to the square on its diameter as 11 to 14. This proposition could not have been placed by Archimedes, for it relies on the outcome of the third proposition. =Proposition three= Proposition three states: > The ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter is greater than > 3\\\\tfrac{10}{71} but less than 3\\\\tfrac{1}{7}. This approximates what we now call the mathematical constant œÄ. He found these bounds on the value of œÄ by inscribing and circumscribing a circle with two similar 96-sided regular polygons. Approximation to square roots This proposition also contains accurate approximations to the square root of 3 (one larger and one smaller) and other larger non-perfect square roots; however, Archimedes gives no explanation as to how he found these numbers. He gives the upper and lower bounds to as > > . However, these bounds are familiar from the study of Pell's equation and the convergents of an associated continued fraction, leading to much speculation as to how much of this number theory might have been accessible to Archimedes. Discussion of this approach goes back at least to Thomas Fantet de Lagny, FRS (compare Chronology of computation of œÄ) in 1723, but was treated more explicitly by Hieronymus Georg Zeuthen. In the early 1880s, Friedrich Otto Hultsch (1833‚Äì1906) and Karl Heinrich Hunrath (b. 1847) noted how the bounds could be found quickly by means of simple binomial bounds on square roots close to a perfect square modelled on Elements II.4, 7; this method is favoured by Thomas Little Heath. Although only one route to the bounds is mentioned, in fact there are two others, making the bounds almost inescapable however the method is worked. But the bounds can also be produced by an iterative geometrical construction suggested by Archimedes' Stomachion in the setting of the regular dodecagon. In this case, the task is to give rational approximations to the tangent of œÄ/12.

Football career Beare was born in Shirley Warren, Southampton, and played for his local team before being spotted by Southern League club Southampton in 1906. He spent most of his time at the Saints playing in the reserves, and was described as \\"a quick touch-line dribbler\\". He made his Southern League debut in the final game of the 1906‚Äì07 season, replacing George Harris in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Bristol Rovers. For the following season, Southampton signed Welsh international John Lewis and Beare spent another season in the reserves before moving to Blackpool in 1908. He spent two full seasons at Blackpool, who were then in the Second Division, before moving on to First Division Everton in autumn 1910. He made his debut for Everton replacing England international Bert Freeman in a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Bradford City on 12 November 1910. Despite joining Everton part way through the season, his eight goals (from 26 appearances) made him the club's joint- top-scorer in the league (with Bill Lacey and Alex Young) for the 1910‚Äì11 season, as Everton finished fourth in the table. The following season, 1911‚Äì12, he was part of the Everton team that reached the runners-up position in the table, finishing three points behind champions Blackburn Rovers, despite a team total of only 46 goals (three from Beare), the fifth-worst total in the league. In 1912‚Äì13, it soon became clear that Everton were struggling to build on the runners up position from he previous season, and they finished eleventh in the league. The lack of goals remained a problem, and despite Tommy Browell and Frank Bradshaw both getting double figures, the team as whole could only manage 48 in total, with Beare contributing seven. Whilst the 1912‚Äì13 season had been disappointing, 1913‚Äì14 was even worse for both Everton and Beare, as the club finished fifteenth in the table, winning only twelve games and avoiding relegation by just five points, with Beare failing to score. At the end of the season, Beare returned to the Southern League to join Cardiff City. Cardiff ended the 1914‚Äì15 season third in the Southern League table, before league football was suspended during the First World War. On the cessation of hostilities, Cardiff spent one final season in the Southern League, finishing fourth, before being invited to join the Football League Second Division as the strongest team in Wales, with the remaining Southern League clubs forming the new Football League Third Division. In their inaugural season in the Football League, Cardiff finished runners-up in the Second Division table equal on points with champions Birmingham but with a far inferior goal average, but this was sufficient to gain promotion to the top flight. They also had a great run in the FA Cup reaching the semi-final stage, where they went out to Wolverhampton Wanderers after a replay. Beare played in all seven FA Cup matches, and scored the solitary goal in the first round victory over Sunderland.Giant killers 1921 Beare returned to Second Division football with Bristol City in November 1921, but after Bristol City were relegated at the end of the 1921‚Äì22 season, he returned to Cardiff City in September 1922. He made no further appearances for Cardiff before playing out his career with Oswestry Town in the Shropshire League. Late in his career it was written about him: \\"If he did not enjoy playing football, he would probably have been one of our leading music hall comedians as he is an expert card manipulator, a trick cyclist of no little repute and an excellent billiards player.\\" Honours Everton *Football League runners-up: 1911‚Äì12 Cardiff City *Football League Second Division runners-up: 1920‚Äì21 References External links *Everton career details Category:1885 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Southampton Category:Association football forwards Category:English footballers Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Everton F.C. players Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Oswestry Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players ","title":"George Beare (footballer)"},{"id":"18203220","text":"Aulacomnium palustre, the bog groove-moss or ribbed bog moss, is a moss that is nearly cosmopolitan in distribution. It occurs in North America, Hispaniola, Venezuela, Eurasia, and New Zealand. In North America, it occurs across southern arctic,\\"Arctic\\" refers to treeless areas underlain with continuous permafrost; \\"subarctic\\" refers to mixed tundra and open forest underlain with discontinuous permafrost. subboreal,\\"Subboreal\\" refers to areas in southern Canada, the Great Lakes states, and the Northeast that were once underlain with permafrost that has since melted. and boreal\\"boreal\\" refers to northern coniferous forests where permafrost occurs only sporadically. regions from Alaska and British Columbia to Greenland and Quebec. Documentation of ribbed bog moss's distribution in the contiguous United States is probably incomplete. It is reported sporadically south to Washington, Wyoming, Georgia, and Virginia. Habitat types and plant communities Ribbed bog moss is frequent in arctic to subboreal wetlands. Moss assemblages are typically diverse in northern (arctic, subarctic, and boreal) plant communities, and individual moss species often have low cover and/or frequency. Moss species with coverages of 2% to 4% can be common to dominant in boreal communities, although ribbed bog moss attains coverages as great as 40% in some boreal communities. Ribbed bog moss grows in open and forested wetland communities. In unforested northern communities, ribbed bog moss is found in sedge (Carex spp.) meadows, sphagnum (Sphagnum spp.) peatlands, heath-sedge fens, and willow (Salix spp.)-dominated fens. In forests, ribbed bog moss grows in the ground layer of boreal and subboreal white spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (P. mariana), mixed spruce-tamarack (Larix laricina), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) fens and bogs of Alaska, Minnesota, and Canada and in boreal spruce-birch (Betula spp.) forests of Alaska and northwestern Canada. Mosses are abundant in taiga forests of interior Alaska and Canada, forming characteristic strata in nearly every taiga forest type. Less is known of ribbed bog moss associations south and east of Minnesota, although ribbed bog moss has been noted in some swamp, coniferous and/or hardwood bog, and grassland communities. Ribbed bog moss grows in red maple (Acer rubrum) swamps of Long Island, New York, and Little listed ribbed bog moss as common (1-4% frequency) in Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps of southern New Jersey.Little, S. 1951. Observations on the minor vegetation of the pine barren swamps in southern New Jersey. Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club. 78(2): 153-160. Ribbed bog moss is also common in jack pine, aspen (Populus spp.), and mixed-hardwood forests of the Great Lakes states and southern Canada. Ribbed bog moss grows on tallgrass prairie in Kansas and Arkansas. In the Pacific Northwest ribbed bog moss occurs in alpine, subalpine, wet and dry coniferous forest, and open peatland communities. In a survey of alpine and unforested subalpine communities of the North Cascade Range in Washington and British Columbia, ribbed bog moss occurred in graminoid, forb, heath, and willow communities. General botanical characteristics Mosses have 2 phases in their life cycle: the gametophyte (n) and sporophyte (2n) generations. Each generation is morphologically distinct. =Gametophytes= Ribbed bog moss stems comprise most of ribbed bog moss's biomass and are easily visible. Stems are erect and spreading in habit, forming clumps or lawns. They range from 1 to 4 inches (3‚Äì9 cm) long; most stems are vegetative but some bear reproductive organs. Short vegetative stems may end in a stalk-bearing clusters of gemmae. Ribbed bog moss is heterothallic, with male and female reproductive organs borne on separate reproductive shoots. Male and female stems develop antheridia and archegonia, respectively, at their tips. Approximately the top 0.6 inch (1.5 cm) of both vegetative and reproductive stems is alive; lower stem tissue is usually dead. Ribbed bog moss leaves are bright yellowish-green to green; their bright color sometimes gives ribbed bog moss an incandescent appearance (\\"glow moss\\"). Bright leaves that contrast starkly with the reddish-brown stems typically make ribbed bog moss the most conspicuous species in moss assemblages. The leaves are lanceolate in shape and often tomentose, becoming twisted and brown when dry. They range from 3 to 5 mm long. Ribbed bog moss anchors to the substrate with rhizoids. Because ribbed bog moss lacks vascular tissue, water uptake occurs by osmosis and capillary action. A network of capillary spaces between stems and rhizoids enhances water uptake; ribbed bog moss usually absorbs water more efficiently than associated sphagnum mosses. =Sporophytes= Sporophytes grow out of archegonia. The sporophyte consists of a foot that anchors the sporophyte to the archegonia, a stalk, and a spore capsule. Ribbed bog moss stalks are vertically straight and about 1.8 inches (4.5 cm) long. Ribbed bog moss is named for its distinct spore capsule, which is strongly ribbed, cylindrical, and about 4 mm long. The capsule is capped with a calyptra. =Regeneration processes= Ribbed bog moss regenerates sexually and vegetatively. Gametophyte dispersal and establishment A spore is the first growth stage of a developing gametophyte. When the spore capsule matures, ribbed bog moss's calyptra splits along the side, exposing spores. Release of the exposed spores requires dry weather and is governed by a row of \\"teeth\\" that ring the capsule's top. The capsule teeth are hygroscopic, bending outward when air is dry and permitting spores to fall. Wind disperses ribbed bog moss spores long distances by shaking the capsule. When air is moist, the teeth bend inward, holding the spores within the capsule. The spores require a moist substrate to germinate. A germinated spore develops into a protonema (a branched, threadlike structure). Rhizoids grow down from the protonema and penetrate the substrate. Stems arise from buds that develop on the protonema surface. As stems grow, they develop their own rhizoids and become independent of the protonema. Mature male and female stems develop antheridia and archegonia, which produce sperm and eggs, respectively. Ribbed bog moss antheridia do not develop synchronously on the same stem. Mature and immature antheridia are intermixed on individual male shoots; therefore, sperm cells on the same stem do not all develop at the same time. However, sperm cells within a single antheridium have synchronous development. Fertilization requires a moist or saturated environment. Before fertilization, the antheridium absorbs water and swells, forcing the spore cap off. Rain may splash sperm into the archegonium, or sperm may swim to the archegonium. Spore banking Ribbed bog moss may germinate from spores stored in the substrate, but banked spores are probably less important to ribbed bog moss regeneration than freshly dispersed spores. Ross-Davis and Frego found that annual dispersal deposited a far greater number of moss spores on boreal substrates compared to the number of spores buried in the spore bank.Ross-Davis, Amy L. and Katherine A. Frego. 2004. Propagule sources of forest floor bryophytes: spatiotemporal compositional patterns. The Bryologist. 107(1): 88-97. Breeding system Ribbed bog moss is dioecious. Sporophyte development Ribbed bog moss's sporophyte generation develops from the fertilized egg. Eggs are fertilized within the archegonium. The sporophyte embryo grows rapidly, differentiating into foot, stalk, and capsule tissue. Spores develop within the capsule. Vegetative regeneration Ribbed bog moss reproduces asexually from specialized gametophyte tissues and from plant breakage. It reproduces frequently from gemmae. Ribbed bog moss may also regenerate when paraphyses (minute filaments arising from ribbed bog moss's antheridia) detach. In the laboratory, 12.5% of detached ribbed bog moss paraphyses developed into propagules. Ribbed bog moss establishes readily when chunks of ribbed bog moss shoots are moved to new sites by soil movement or transplanting. Ribbed bog moss is apparently competitive in its ability to establish from stem chunks. In a laboratory experiment, ribbed bog moss that was collected from an Alberta peatland, shredded, and placed on a peat substrate showed greatest frequency (100%) of 4 moss species so treated. Ribbed bog moss also showed fastest growth relative to the other mosses throughout the 125-day experiment. Growth Ribbed bog moss growth is robust. It showed a \\"tall and dense growth habit\\" in a greenhouse common garden; ribbed bog moss, juniper hair cap moss (Polytrichum juniperinum), and papillose sphagnum (S. papillosum) crowded out 3 other moss species. Dry climate slows or stops ribbed bog moss growth. On the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites study area in Saskatchewan, ribbed bog moss had a negative mean annual growth rate in a drought year (2003). Mean annual growth rate in a wet year (2004) was 2.7 mm. Ribbed bog moss was sensitive to saturated conditions in the wet year; stem lengths were greatest on relatively drier microsites, and ribbed bog moss growth rate increased slightly with increasing depth to the water table. =Site characteristics= Ribbed bog moss is a habitat generalist. It was, for example, 1 of 6 mosses having broad ecological amplitude in a survey of bryophyte habitats on peatlands across Alberta's Mackenzie River basin. Ribbed bog moss tolerates a wide range of moisture levels, substrates, nutrient loads, terrain, and climates. Moisture regime Ribbed bog moss generally grows on wetlands including fens, bogs, marshes, pond margins, streambanks, wet meadows, and riparian shrublands. In subalpine fir forests of central Idaho, ribbed bog moss occurs on seeps and springs that remain moist throughout the fire season. Ribbed bog moss is an indicator species of wet to very wet soils in Canada. In northern British Columbia, ribbed bog moss is an indicator species of undisturbed wet conifer sites. The white spruce/field horsetail/ribbed bog moss association occurs on the wettest white spruce forests in subboreal British Columbia; the water table is near the soil surface for most of the growing season. In a geothermal meadow in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, ribbed bog moss occurred on sites with high local humidity (31-66%) due to nearby thermal pools. Ribbed bog moss did not grow on dry sites, although drained microsites may favor ribbed bog moss growth on otherwise saturated substrates. Ribbed bog moss does not tolerate salt spray, which prevents its establishment on coastal dunelands. Ribbed bog moss is not confined to wet sites in all areas. Some forests with ribbed bog moss dry in late summer, and ribbed bog moss grows on relatively xeric hummock mounds on bogs in Birds Hill Provincial Park, Manitoba. Ribbed bog moss occupies both dry and wet sites on the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites study area. It dominates relatively dry, shaded microsites in the area; the water table is 20 to 26 inches (50‚Äì65 cm) below ground, and there is 30% to 60% black spruce and/or tamarack cover. Substrates Ribbed bog moss is primarily a groundlayer species, but it does not require a particular substrate to establish and grow. It is most common on peat but also grows on thinner organic soils and other substrates. Ribbed bog moss frequently grows on peat overlying permafrost in Alaska and northern Canada. On northern peatlands, the peat layer generally ranges from 38 to 102 inches (15‚Äì40 cm) thick, and organic content of the soil layer is high. Studies on peatlands in Quebec showed ribbed bog moss \\"preferred sites with high organic matter depth\\" (P<0.01). Ribbed bog moss grows on organic surface layers overlying varying soil textures. Ribbed bog moss also grows on burned substrates including ash, mineral soil, scorched organic soil, scorched peat, and scorched downed woody debris. Ribbed bog moss grows on peat and other organic soil layers more often than on downed bark or wood, but is reported growing on woody debris or other dead wood in a few locations. In northern British Columbia, ribbed bog moss substrates included disturbed forest floors, logs, and stumps at 44%, 13%, and 3% frequencies, respectively. Ribbed bog moss was found on downed woody debris in a mixed quaking aspen-paper birch-balsam fir (Populus tremuloides-Betula papyrifera-Abies balsamifera) forest in east-central Alberta and on stumps in a mixed-hardwood forest in Wisconsin. Ribbed bog moss rarely grows on standing live or dead wood. Ribbed bog moss showed broad substrate tolerances in a greenhouse common pot study in Scotland. Ribbed bog moss vegetative propagules were sown with propagules of 6 other mosses to test substrate preferences. After 1 year, ribbed bog moss abundance was similar on heather (Calluna vulgaris) litter, European white birch (Betula pendula) litter, dead shrub litter, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) needles, sand, and sphagnum peat substrates. To test particle-size microsite preferences on peat substrates, the peat was broken into various fragment sizes from minute to large (<0.25 inch to >2 inches (0.63‚Äì5 cm)). Ribbed bog moss grew on peat of all particle sizes but was most frequent on small (0.5-1 inch (1.25-2.5 cm)) peat particles. Water and substrate chemistry The pH of water, peat, and/or soil is usually acidic to neutral in mires with ribbed bog moss, although ribbed bog moss tolerates mildly alkaline conditions. For example, ribbed bog moss grows in extremely acidic peatlands overlying permafrost in spruce taiga of Alaska but also grows in calcareous bogs in Birds Hill Provincial Park. In Minnesota, ribbed bog moss is reported from bogs ranging from 5.0 to 7.3 in pH. A survey of bryophytes on peatlands across Alberta's Mackenzie River basin found ribbed bog moss was abundant on sites ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 in pH. Mires are classified on pH and mineral gradients from extreme-poor (very strongly acid and low in calcium and magnesium) to extreme-rich (neutral to alkaline and high in calcium and magnesium). Fens are richer than bogs. Ribbed bog moss occurs in poor and rich mires. On mires across British Columbia and Alberta, ribbed bog moss grows in mires with broad ranges of water pH and electrical conductivity, but is most common on strongly acidic peatlands (water pH <5.5) with moderate calcium and magnesium levels (<200 ŒºS/cm**). Ribbed bog moss also grows in moderate-rich fens with higher pH and electrical conductivity values. In a peat-core study in central Alberta, macrofossil ribbed bog moss was an indicator species of moderate-rich fens; ribbed bog moss occurred most often on mires that were moderately acidic (x pH=6.0) and had low electrical conductivity (x=125 ŒºS/cm) and moderately high water tables (x= 8.7 inches (22 cm) deep). In a study of alpine mires in Italy, ribbed bog moss was intermediate in mire pH and mineral content compared to associated nonvascular and vascular plant species, occurring on both poor and rich mires. All associated mosses had narrower pH and mineral tolerances than ribbed bog moss. Gignac provides information on ribbed bog moss habitats in British Columbia and Alberta including ranges in pH, electrical conductivity, relative depth to the water table, and relative overstory cover. Nutrients Field observations and laboratory experiments suggest that ribbed bog moss has broad tolerance and may be relatively insensitive to macronutrient concentrations. On the Svalbard archipelago in Norway, ribbed bog moss grows on small \\"bird islands\\" where eiders, Arctic terns, and other migratory birds nest offshore of the main island, Spitsbergen. Nitrogen levels on the bird islands are very high. On Spitsbergen Island, however, ribbed bog moss grows on dry hummocks and moist hummock edges, both of which have low nitrogen levels but probably provide moisture levels that favor ribbed bog moss. In a laboratory experiment, nitrogen fertilizer initially slowed ribbed bog moss growth rate, but growth rates of ribbed bog moss with and without nitrogen were similar at the end of 125 days. Addition of phosphorus had no effect on ribbed bog moss growth. Ribbed bog moss is listed as an indicator species of nitrogen-medium soils in British Columbia. Landscape Tundra and taiga areas where ribbed bog moss grows are generally flat to gently sloped, but local relief creates drainage patterns that often result in distinct moss assemblages. Site geology, including topography, bedrock composition, catchment hydrology, and basin bathymetry, affects wetland drainage and partially controls rates of transition from open water to bog. Ribbed bog moss is common on hummocks, which tend to dry out faster than adjacent lowlands. In British Columbia and Alberta, ribbed bog moss often dominates hummock tops that are surrounded by sphagnum peatlands. Although ribbed bog moss generally attains greatest coverage on hummock tops, it sometimes forms lawns and strings in low areas. In Labrador, tufted bulrush-mountain fly honeysuckle/ribbed bog moss associations occur on low strings of consolidated peat and on elevated peatlands. The low strings lie 38 to 76 inches (15‚Äì30 cm) above the water table and lack erosion patterns. In Kluane National Park, Yukon, the white spruce/ribbed bog moss forest community occurs on poorly drained east- and north-facing slopes. =Elevation= There are few reports of ribbed bog moss's elevational tolerances. Ribbed bog moss is reported from 1,600 to 5,700 feet (500-1,750 m) in west-central Alberta and at 827 feet (252 m) in Kosciucko County, Indiana. In subalpine and alpine communities of the North Cascade Range in Washington and British Columbia, ribbed bog moss occurs on high-elevation (>7,380 feet (2,250 m)) sites that remain snow-free most of the year. Climate Ribbed bog moss occurs in arctic, subarctic, boreal, and subboreal zones with cold meso-thermal, oceanic, continental, or cold-humid climates. It is more common in arctic, subarctic, and boreal than subboreal zones. A survey of bryophytes on peatlands across Alberta's Mackenzie River basin found optimal ribbed bog moss growth occurred on sites with annual temperatures ranging from 20 to 32 ¬∞F (-4 to 0 ¬∞C). In interior arctic, subarctic, and boreal zones, climate is strongly continental in the west, becoming more humid to the east. Climate shift from continental to humid generally occurs near Hudson Bay and Lake Superior. In a study of moss habitats across British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba, ribbed bog moss was an indicator species for continentality of climate: it was the only moss common to all continental peatlands surveyed. On sites from coastal British Columbia to central Alberta, ribbed bog moss was most common on subcontinental sites (intermediate between coastal and continental climates). Ribbed bog moss was intermediate on gradients ranking breadth of moss habitat niches. Climate factors evaluated included length of growing season, amount of precipitation during the growing season, temperature, and aridity. Feather mosses (Hylocomiaceae) and sphagnum mosses generally had wider niches and dominated more sites than ribbed bog moss. Ribbed bog moss's rarity on all but cold sites in the lower 48 states suggests that ribbed bog moss does not tolerate long periods of warm weather. In a geothermal meadow on Queen Charlotte Island, British Columbia, ribbed bog moss was absent from sites where nearby thermal pools raised local soil temperatures above 86 ¬∞F (30 ¬∞C). Uses =Importance to wildlife and livestock= Ribbed bog moss provides few known direct benefits to wildlife or livestock. Mosses in general are low in carbohydrates, proteins, and fats compared to vascular plants, and animals seldom graze them. Caribou may eat mosses when little other forage is available. Wildlife seeking cover probably avoid open areas dominated by ribbed bog moss or other low vegetation. In Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, aerial photos identified areas dominated by ribbed bog moss, bog Labrador tea, and/or Bebb willow as indicators of nonnesting habitat for whooping cranes. American robins at the Mountain Lake Biological Station, Virginia, used ribbed bog moss as nest material. Northern mires provide habitat for a variety of invertebrates including worms, crustaceans, arachnids, and insects, particularly mosquitoes, midges, and other flies. =Value for rehabilitation of disturbed sites= Chunks from ribbed bog moss lawns can be transplanted onto disturbed sites. In Minnesota, moss plugs used in restoration projects on old peat mines are harvested from nearby unmined sites in spring, before the ground thaws. Although ribbed bog moss is not often used for restoration, it could be a valuable addition to restoration projects. Foote classified ribbed bog moss communities along the Alaskan Highway in Yukon as having \\"high site sensitivity\\", with moderate potential for erosion.Foote, M. Joan. 1983.

Newport, in his study of the influence of New Age beliefs, described the central focus of the Seth Material as the idea that each individual creates his or her own reality, a foundational concept of the New Age movement first articulated in the Seth Material.Newport, John P. The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing 1998, p. 165.  History  In late 1963, Jane Roberts and her husband, Robert Butts, experimented with a Ouija board as part of Roberts' research for a book on extra-sensory perception.ESP Power, by Jane Roberts (2000) (introductory essay by Lynda Dahl). Roberts and Butts claimed that they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality on December 2, 1963, who later identified himself as Seth. Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages in her head. She began to dictate the messages instead of using the Ouija board, and the board was eventually abandoned. For 21 years until Roberts' death in 1984 (with a one-year hiatus due to her final illness), Roberts held regular sessions in which she went into a trance and purportedly spoke on behalf of Seth.Other Lives, Other Selves: A Jungian Psychotherapist Discovers Past Lives, by Roger Woolger (1988). According to Roberts, Seth described himself as an \\"energy personality essence no longer focused in physical matter\\"Chapter 1, Session 511, Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul, by Jane Roberts (1972). who was independent of Roberts' subconscious, although Roberts expressed skepticism as to Seth's origins, frequently referring to Seth's statements as \\"theories\\".Chapter 10, The Seth Material, by Jane Roberts (1970). Roberts claimed that Seth indicated he had completed his earthly reincarnations and was speaking from an adjacent plane of existence. The Seth personality described himself as a \\"teacher\\",Chapter 1, Session 511, and Chapter 2, Session 514, Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul, by Jane Roberts (1972). and said: \\"this material has been given by himself and others in other times and places, but that it is given again, in new ways, for each succeeding generation through the centuries.\\" Unlike the psychic Edgar Cayce, whose syntax when speaking in trance was antiquated and convoluted, Roberts' syntax and sentence structures were modern and clear when speaking as Seth. Roberts often sat in a rocking chair during sessions, and she would occasionally smoke cigarettes and sip beer or wine. Afterwards, she claimed to not remember the contents of the session, and she would often read the transcript or ask what Seth had said. Summary The core teachings of the Seth Material are based on the principle that consciousness creates matter,Chapter 1, Seth Speaks, by Jane Roberts (1972); \\"Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around\\". and that each individual creates his or her own reality through thoughts, beliefs and expectations, and that the \\"point of power\\" through which the individual can affect change is in the present moment. The Seth Material discusses a wide range of metaphysical concepts, including the nature of God (referred to as \\"All That Is\\" and \\"The Multidimensional God\\"); the nature of physical reality; the origins of the universe; the nature of the self and the \\"higher self\\"; the story of Christ; the evolution of the soul and all aspects of death and rebirth, including reincarnation and karma, past lives, after-death experiences, \\"guardian spirits\\", and ascension to planes of \\"higher consciousness\\"; the purpose of life and the nature of good and evil; the purpose of suffering; multidimensional reality, parallel lives and transpersonal realms. =Nature of the self= According to the Seth Material, the entire self or \\"entity\\" is a gestalt consisting of the inner self, various selves that the entity has assumed through past existences (physical and non-physical), plus all the currently incarnated selves, and all their probable counterparts, and reincarnation is included as a core principle. Wouter Hanegraaff, Professor of History of Hermetic Philosophy, University of Amsterdam, says that these ideas have been influential to other new age authors (some of whom use the term \\"higher self\\" to refer to the same concept), and that Roberts' terminology has been adopted by some of those authors. Hanegraaff says that Seth uses various terms to refer to the concept of the \\"self\\", including \\"entity\\", \\"whole self\\", \\"gestalt\\", and \\"(over)soul\\". =Reality= The Seth Material says that all individuals create their own circumstances and experiences within the shared earthly environment, similar to the doctrine of responsibility assumption. This concept is expressed in the phrase \\"you create your own reality\\", which may have originated with the Seth readings.. (although Nietzsche stated, some 90 years earlier, on the subject of \\"Becoming who you are,\\" that: \\"We, however, want to become who we are‚Äîhuman beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves!\\"). The inner self, or inner ego, is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the individual's physical body and immediate physical environment, and the unfolding of events is determined by the expectations, attitudes and beliefs of the outer ego, that portion of the self that human beings know as themselves. \\"If you want to change your world, you must first change your thoughts, expectations, and beliefs.\\" Or, more succinctly: \\"You get what you concentrate upon. There is no other main rule\\". The books discuss the idea that the physical environment is constructed and maintained by the inner selves of the individual occupants (including the animals).Session 610, The Nature of Personal Reality, by Jane Roberts (1974). The inner selves project, en masse, a pattern for physical reality which is then filled with energy, as needed, by each individual. All events are also produced in the same manner.

Relationship with Christianity According to the Seth Material, Jesus Christ exists as part of the Christ entity, a highly evolved entity who exists in many systems of reality. At the time of Christ, the Christ entity incarnated as three individuals: John the Baptist, Jesus of Nazareth, and Paul or Saul of Tarsus. Other authorship claims Other authors have written material they claimed was channeled from Seth, especially after Roberts' death. These included Thomas Massari, who founded the Seth- Hermes Foundation and said he had channeled Seth as early as 1972, and Jean Loomis, director of the Aquarian Center in ConnecticutFuller, Robert C.

However, in the introduction to the first book written about Seth, Seth is said to have conveyed that \\"communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [Seth's name for Jane] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material\\". In The Seth Material, Jane Roberts wrote: \\"Several people have told me that Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts.\\" Criticism Charles Upton in his book The System of Antichrist, argues that the reason Jane Roberts multiplies the self in many ways is due to a fear of death, and that the Seth texts are based on a misunderstanding of both Christianity and of Eastern religions. The implied influences of Eastern mysticism and philosophy are also highlighted in Astrology and Psychic Phenomena by Terry Holley, E Calvin Beisner and Robert M Bowman Jr, who say \\"Husband Robert Butts admitted that similarities exist between Seth's ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East . . . and we've done a little reading on Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen, and Taoism, for example, not to mention subjects like shamanism, voodooism, and obeah.\\"Kole, Andre; E Calvin Beisner, Robert M Bowman Jr, Terry Holley Astrology and Psychic Phenomena Zondervan Publishing House 1989 p.51 According to Robert C. Fuller, Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called \\"unchurched American spirituality,\\" including the topics of reincarnation, karma, free will, ancient metaphysical wisdom, and \\"Christ consciousness.\\"Fuller, Robert C. Spiritual, But Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America. Oxford University Press 2001, p. 60.

He was the successor to Teophilus Seremi in the seat of Mitropoliei BƒÉlgradului (Alba-Iulia). Through his continued efforts, he perfected the union of the Romanian Transylvanians with the Catholic Church.[Silvestru Augustin Prundu≈ü, Clemente PlƒÉianu: Catholicism and Romanian Orthodoxy. Short history of the Romanian United Church. Christian Life Publishing House, Cluj 1994.]  Life  He was born in Bobalna, Hunedoara, the son of an Orthodox priest from Rapoltu Mare (today in Hunedoara county) who was a nobleman of Ciugud.[John M. Bota, History of the Universal Church and the Romanian Church from its origins to today, p. 162.] Anghel was ordained bishop on January 22, 1698, by Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan Teodosius (1620-1708), Primate of the Metropolitan diocese of Ungro-Wallachia and by Patriarch of Jerusalem Dositheos II (1641-1707), who was in exile.[Timotei Cipariu, Acts and Fragments, Blaj, 1855, p. 210.] Patriarch Dositheos II also asked Bishop Atanasie Anghel to listen to both the Greek hierarchs from the court of voivode Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu,[Onisifor Ghibu, Rost of the Patriarch of Dositei of Jerusalem in Romania, as an enemy of the Romanian people and of the Romanian language and culture, in the Society of tomorrow, Nr. 28, Cluj, 1924, p. 556] who supervised the work of the Romanian hierarchs[Nicolae Iorga, History of the Romanian Church, vol. 2, Bucharest, 1930, p. 16.] and the Transylvanian Calvinist hierarchy.  First synod of Alba Iulia  left On 7 October 1698 he convened the \\"Union Synod\\" in Alba Iulia. The Act of Union with the Catholic Church was signed not only by Atanasie Anghel, but by all members of the Synod (38 district protopopes[The signatures of the 38 protopopes were verified and authenticated by Silviu Dragomir, Romanians from Transylvania and the Union with the Church of Rome, Cluj, 1990, p. 35.] and 2270 priests), and sealed with the seal of the Metropolitan Archbishopric of Alba Iulia (Mitropolia BƒÉlgradului in old Romanian language). The Transylvanian Diet, controlled by Protestants, did not look favorably upon the confessional issues of the Romanian people. Large land holders began to persecute the new Romanian Greek-Catholic priests, a situation which Atanasie Anghel had to cope with. Protestant noblemen encouraged revolts among peasants opposed to joining the Catholic Church. Under these circumstances, the bishop Atanasie Anghel convened a new synod, also held at Alba-Iulia on 4 September 1700. This was attended not only by protopopes and priests, but also by 3 laymen delegates from each Romanian village. The 54 protopopes, together with the priests and all the delegations present, signed a new act which reinforced the decision of the synod of 1698, reaffirming religious unification of Romanians in Transylvania with the Catholic Church. For Greek-Catholic bishop Atanasie Anghel, there followed years of hardship, being attacked by Calvinists and also by the Orthodox Archdiocese of Bucharest. Atanasie was summoned to Vienna to give explanations. Under these circumstances, on 7 April 1701 he made a statement that he no longer recognized the Archbishop of Bucharest as his superior. Business activities Metropolitan Athanasius was accused several times of carrying out commercial activities. Fifteen years before joining Rome he bought a house in Alba Iulia where he brewed beer and wine. In 1703, after the union with Rome, he was summoned to cease this activity, considered incompatible with the status of bishop.[A. Bitay, An Outstanding Nothing in the Life of Atanasie Anghel, in: Historical Review XXI (1935), pp. 21-22.] In 1711, he still earned income from beer production.[Nicolae Iorga, Two letters of Atanasie Anghel in: Romanian Academy. Memoirs of the Historical Section, Series III, Volume XIII (1933), pp. 7-8.] Death Anghel died in Alba Iulia on August 19, 1713, being buried near the old church of the BƒÉlgrad Metropolitanate (built by the ruler Mihai Viteazul). Subsequently, with the construction of the Alba Carolina Citadel, the old church was demolished, and the tomb of Atanasie was moved to the cemetery near the Holy Trinity Church in Alba Iulia.

Biography Rizvi was educated at the Habib Public School in Karachi and the Government College in Lahore and qualified as a medical doctor specializing in sports medicine. He has also served with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on their medical commission and has been in the news due to his work regarding fitness problems faced by bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Rizvi now runs a Fitness centre in Lahore. Rizvi came to the limelight when he earned a bronze medal in the 800 meters event at the National Athletics Championship in Peshawar in 1982. One year later, at the same competition in Hyderabad he finished second in the same event and was then again third in Faisalabad in 1984. At the 1984 Summer Olympics Rizvi ran the 400 meters in 49.58 seconds in his heat, finishing seventh and last. In his 800 meters heat, he ended with a time of 1:51.29 minutes which placed him fifth out of seven runners. At the first South Asian Federation (SAF) Games in Kathmandu that year, he competed in the 1,500 meters race but finished sixth. At the National Athletics Championship in Islamabad in 1985 he was second in the 800 metres and finally won a gold medal in the 400 meters event at the Nationals in Rawalpindi in 1987 with a time of 53.32 seconds. Rizvi won a silver medal as part of Pakistan's 4x400 meters relay quartet at the SAF Games in Dhaka in 1985. He ran it in 1:49.60 minutes but still got a silver medal in 800 meters in an International Meet in Delhi 1987. He represented Pakistan at the 2nd IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Rome in 1987, but did not start in his first round heat 6 in the 800 meters event. At the 1988 Summer Olympics Rizvi took part only in the 800 metres race. He ended sixth out of eight in his heat with a time of 1:51.58. Overall, he was ranked 50th out of a total of 70 participants.

A plant layout study is an engineering study used to analyze different physical configurations for a manufacturing plant.Systematic Layout Planning, Muther, Cahners, 1973 It is also known as Facilities Planning and Layout.  Overview  The ability to design and operate manufacturing facilities that can quickly and effectively adapt to changing technological and market requirements is becoming increasingly important to the success of any manufacturing organization. In the face of shorter product life cycles, higher product variety, increasingly unpredictable demand, and shorter delivery times, manufacturing facilities dedicated to a single product line cannot be cost effective any longer. Investment efficiency now requires that manufacturing facilities be able to shift quickly from one product line to another without major retooling, resource reconfiguration, or replacement of equipment. Investment efficiency also requires that manufacturing facilities be able to simultaneously make several products so that smaller volume products can be combined in a single facility and that fluctuations in product mixes and volumes can be more easily accommodated. In short, manufacturing facilities must be able to exhibit high levels of flexibility and robustness despite significant changes in their operating requirements. In industry sectors, it is important to manufacture the products which have good quality and meet customers‚Äô demand. This action could be conducted under existing resources such as employees, machines and other facilities. However, plant layout improvement, could be one of the tools to response to increasing industrial productivity. Plant layout design has become a fundamental basis of today‚Äôs industrial plants which can influence parts of work efficiency. It is needed to appropriately plan and position employees, materials, machines, equipment, and other manufacturing supports and facilities to create the most effective plant layout.

Play moves in circles until one player has captured every other players' cones on the board and declared the winner. All players are welcome to occupy any space throughout the game, provided the die rolls allow, and there are eight spaces that serve as \\"safe\\" spots, where a cone resting on this space cannot be captured. Captured pieces are not sent back to start, but are permanently lost. Like similar games such as Trouble, Headache has its dice in a \\"pop-o-matic\\" bubble in the center of the board. The bubble is pressed to roll the dice. Unlike Trouble, which has a single die in the bubble, Headache has two dice. One die is a regular die featuring the numbers one through six. The other is blank on five sides, and has a red dot on the sixth side. The red dot, if rolled allows for an extra turn. Headache was first introduced in 1968 by the Kohner Brothers and was later manufactured by Milton Bradley. In the UK the game (called Game of Headache) was released in 1968 through Peter Pan Playthings.https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9921/headache The board Video of the Headache board's \\"pop-o-matic\\" dice roller Headache uses a round board in which movement is around the outside of the board, and the bubble with the dice is in the center. There is a starting point for each of the four colors. The board has a total of 48 spaces, including 8 safe spots (each marked with an X). Four of these eight safe spots are starting points. The spaces protrude from the surface of the board, thereby allowing the cones to rest on them neatly. The board has two tracks, the outer and the inner track. The outer track has three spaces between Xs, and the inner track has two. Both tracks merge at each X. This difference allows players to strategically move around the board. Any player who has their cone on a safe spot (X) cannot be captured, and an opponent is not permitted to land a cone on such a spot occupied by one. A player is allowed to keep his/her cone on an X as long as he or she wishes, provided there is another legal move. The exception is on the first four rounds of turns, in which each player must move a different cone, clearing the starting space. Cones and stacks The starting set up for Game of Headache (UK version) The playing pieces in the game are known as \\"cones\\" (or \\"men\\" in the UK) because of their cone shape. This allows them to be stacked on top of one another in unlimited numbers. Each player starts off with four cones, and whenever one player lands on the space occupied by the cone of another, this player captures the opponent's cone. The capturing player places their cone on top of the cone of the player being captured, where it remains throughout the game. The result is known as a \\"stack.\\" Stacks have the special privilege to move around the board in either direction, whereas single cones may only move clockwise.

Located in Williamsburg, Virginia, it is a part of William & Mary, the second oldest college and first university in the United States. The Law School has an enrollment of 645 full-time students (in 2018‚Äì19) seeking a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or an LL.M. in the American Legal System, a two or three semester program for lawyers trained outside the United States. History William & Mary Law School was founded in 1779 at the impetus of Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson, an alumnus of the university, during the reorganization of the originally royal institution, transforming the college of William and Mary into the first university in the United States. At Jefferson's urging, the governing board of visitors of William & Mary established a chair of law and appointed George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, delegate to the Philadelphia Convention, and Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, its first holder. (In the English- speaking world, older law professorships include the chair at Oxford University, first held by William Blackstone, the chair at Edinburgh University's School of Law (1709), and the Regius Chair of Law at Glasgow University). Statue of Marshall and Wythe at the entrance of the Law School Before filling the chair of law at William & Mary, Wythe tutored numerous students in the subject, Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe among them. John Marshall, who became Chief Justice of the United States in 1801, received his only formal legal education when he attended Wythe's lectures at William & Mary in 1780. St. George Tucker, who succeeded Wythe as Professor of Law and edited the seminal early American edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, also was one of Wythe's students. The growth of the Law School was halted abruptly by the beginning of the American Civil War. The start of military campaigns on the Virginia Peninsula compelled William & Mary to close its doors. It would be another sixty years before the historical priority in law could be revived in a modern program that is now nearly ninety years old. After William & Mary Law School was reopened early in the twentieth century, it was moved around the main campus of the university to several different buildings in succession. In 1980, the School was moved to its current location on the outskirts of Colonial Williamsburg, a short distance from the main campus. The building has been renovated several times since 1980, with the addition of a new wing of classrooms and renovation of older classrooms in 2000, the opening of the Henry C. Wolf Law Library, the construction of a new admission suite, and the addition of the James A. and Robin L. Hixon Center for Experiential Learning and Leadership (dedicated in 2017). W. Taylor Reveley III, formerly managing partner of the law firm of Hunton & Williams, is a former dean of the Law School. He served as the 27th president of William & Mary from September 5, 2008 to June 30, 2018, after serving as interim president since February 2008. Davison M. Douglas (J.D., Ph.D., M.Phil., M.A., M.A.R.), a nationally renowned legal historian, served as dean from July 2009 through June 30, 2020. A. Benjamin Spencer, a nationally renowned civil procedure and federal courts expert and former professor of law at the University of Virginia, became dean and Chancellor Professor at William & Mary Law School on July 1, 2020. He is William & Mary‚Äôs first African-American dean of any school at the university, including the law school. The former chancellor of William & Mary, Sandra Day O'Connor, delivered commencement remarks to the graduating class of the Law School in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Cost of attendance Tuition at William & Mary for the 2019-20 academic year was $35,000 for Virginia residents and $44,000 for non-residents. Approximately 88% of students received financial aid (2017). Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years, based on data from the 2018-2019 academic year, is $197,520 for residents; the estimated cost for non-residents is $229,557. Employment According to William & Mary's official 2019 ABA-required disclosures, 95% of the Class of 2019 obtained full-time, long-term, JD- required or JD-advantaged, non-school funded employment nine months after graduation. William & Mary's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 10%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2018 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation, with 0% of the class in school-funded jobs.

The program commenced in 1950 and was originally planned to take 10 years and cost ¬£80 million pounds. (VR publicity brochure) Operation Phoenix was named after the bird from Egyptian mythology. Background The Victorian Railways of the 1930s and 1940s had become run down, with years of economic depression, the war effort, and material shortages resulting in a general decline. At the time it was expected that a railway the size of VR should have been building 25 locomotives, 30 to 40 carriages, and 500 wagons per year, as well as relaying 60 miles of track. In reality VR were only able to build an average of 4 locomotives and 200 wagons per year, and these gains had been counteracted by long overdue scrappings. When World War II hit, the VR had no chance to rebuild, with resources being directed towards the war effort, only patch up work and essential maintenance was possible. Furthermore, passenger travel had been restricted by government, then cut even further due to fuel shortages, with trains taking longer and buffet carriages removed. Despite this, in 1948-49 country passenger business was up 76 percent on that of 1938-39, which were considered the best pre war years, and suburban traffic was up 22 percent. In addition, goods traffic was up by 53 percent, with more goods being handled than any of the war years. After the end of the war, rebuilding work began in a small way, with new steel, air-conditioned carriages built, as well as new sleeping-cars for The Overland. However, the growth in patronage was due to a lack of alternate transport, with wartime petrol rationing still in force. Passengers were unimpressed with the service provided, and were looking for someone to blame. In 1949 a review of the Victorian Railways was commissioned by transport minister Kent Hughes, and was carried out by British Railways Chief Executive John Elliot. The report found much to admire in the management and staff, but criticised the run-down locomotives, rolling stock, and track and predicted a \\"final breakdown of rail transport\\" in ten years if nothing was done. The ideas of the report were not new, the Victorian Railways had been making plans for modernisation of their operations, but did not have the money or political will to implement them. Works R class steam locomotive Operation Phoenix was conceived to address these issues, and took 18 months of planning before it was publicly released. As a whole the program would cost ¬£83 million, with ¬£40 million to be spent on rolling stock, including: * 350 steam and diesel locomotives * 30 railcars * 290 steel passenger cars * 280 suburban passenger carriages * 9000 goods wagons * 300 goods vans Capital works took up the other ¬£43 million, and were planned to cover: * An underground railway between a new Richmond station and North Melbourne via the north of the Melbourne CBD (not realised until the City Loop of the 1980s) * track modernisation, rebuilding, regrading and duplication of existing lines * replacement of timber bridges to permit heavier trains * modernisation of locomotives depots and workshops * reconstruction and expending Melbourne Yard and associated goods sheds F class diesel shunting locomotive Initial projects included: * 100 steam locomotives * 17 diesel electric locomotives * 10 diesel electric shunting locomotives * 30 self-propelled railcars * 1000 goods wagons * Electrification, regrading and duplication of the main Gippsland line from Dandenong to Traralgon, to cope with demand for Morwell brown coal and to reduce the dependence on New South Wales coal. * importation of electric locos * new substations on the suburban railway lines To ensure the earliest possible delivery, the construction of the steam locomotives, railcars, and half of the wagons was contracted to British firms, with 18 of the railcars had already been completed by 1950. The major components for the mainline diesel electric locomotives were to be imported from the United States, dependent on the allocation of foreign exchange funds from the federal government. The remainder of the new rolling stock was constructed by the VR's own workshops, including 20 of the \\"N class\\" steam engines, 14 new air-conditioned passenger cars, and 2 new suburban trains. Funding difficulties After the 1951-52 financial year, the Victorian Railways were almost ¬£6 million pounds in deficit. Freight rates and passenger fares were increased, but the VR still did not expect to make ends meet. The program of works for 1952-53 was intended to be ¬£12.5 million, and was intended to cover the duplication of the Alamein line between Camberwell and Ashburton, track amplification between Flinders Street and South Yarra, a new Richmond station, importation of 1500 precut houses from England for railway staff, and the purchase of equipment for the use of pulverised brown coal in steam locomotives. (VR publicity brochure) However loans became difficult to negotiate due to money market issues, and so the budget for Operation Phoenix was cut back to ¬£6.8 million. Capital works were slowed, with the loss of employment for many men, and hundreds of thousands of pounds of material were held in storage. Works on the Gippsland electrification was to be completed to Warragul station by 1953, but due to the funding cuts the time line was revised to 1954. 500 of the precut houses were cancelled, the Victorian contribution to joint carriage stock for use on The Overland was cut to 6 sitting cars, and work at Newport Workshops building locomotives, carriages and livestock trucks was suspended. Outside rolling stock contractors were also told to slow down, and to defer claims for progress payments until the 1953-54 financial year. By June 1952 the rolling stock situation was: * All 50 of the N class steam locomotive order in service * 64 of the 70 strong R class steam locomotive order in service * 60 J class steam locomotives on order * 10 F class diesel shunting locomotives delivered * 26 B class main line diesels on order * 25 L class electrics on order * All 30 of the Walker railcars in service * DERM fleet refurbished * 137 goods wagons built by the VR workshops * 1825 open wagons built by outside contractors By the end of that year five of the B class diesels and five more R classes were in service.  Outcomes  By 1953 the new mainline diesels were running a week, four times as far as the best steam locomotives. (VR publicity brochure, extracts of an address by R. G. Wishart, Chairman of Commissioners) An hour had been cut from long-distance passenger trains to Adelaide, Bairnsdale, Warrnambool, Mildura, and others were also sped up with the delivery of further locomotives. Electrification of the Gippsland line was completed to Warragul in 1954 and to Traralgon in 1956 at a total cost of ¬£6.3 million, but electrification did not spread to the other country railways as originally intended by Operation Phoenix, as the new diesel locomotives were more cost effective than the electrics. Dieselisation of the Victorian Railways continued, with the T class branchline locomotives delivered from 1955. Operation Phoenix was also the peak of capital spending on the Victorian railways, the expenditure during 1950-51 was not exceeded until 1984-85.

He was later reintroduced to the African wild by conservationist George Adamson. One year after Adamson released Christian to the wild, his former owners decided to go looking for him to see whether Christian would remember them. He did, and with him were two lionesses who accepted the men as well. Early years Christian was born on 12 August 1969. Christian was originally acquired by Harrods from the now-defunct zoo park in Ilfracombe. Rendall and Bourke purchased Christian for 250 guineas (¬£262.10s.262 pounds and 10 shillings, or 262 pounds in pre-decimal currency). Rendall and Bourke,Bourke have been erroneously cited in various sources as Berg. along with their friends Jennifer Mary Taylor and Unity Jones, cared for the lion where they lived in London until he was a year old. As he got larger, the men moved Christian to their furniture store‚Äîcoincidentally named Sophistocat‚Äîwhere living quarters in the basement were set aside for him. Rendall and Bourke obtained permission from a local vicar to exercise Christian at the Moravian church graveyard just off the King's Road and Milman's Street, SW10; and the men also took the lion on day trips to the seaside. Christian's growing size and the increasing cost of his care led Rendall and Bourke to understand they could not keep him in London. When Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna, stars of the film Born Free, visited Rendall and Bourke's furniture store and met Christian, they suggested that Bourke and Rendall ask the assistance of George Adamson. Adamson, a British conservationist and advocate for lions in Kenya, who together with his wife Joy raised and released Elsa the lioness, agreed to reintegrate Christian into the wild at their compound in the Kora National Reserve. Virginia McKenna wrote about the experience in her memoir The Life in My Years, published March 2009. Adamson introduced Christian to an older male lion, \\"Boy\\", who had been used in the feature film Born Free and who also featured prominently in the documentary film The Lions Are Free, and subsequently to a female cub Katania in order to form the nucleus of a new pride. The pride suffered many setbacks: Katania was possibly devoured by crocodiles at a watering hole; another female was killed by wild lions; and Boy was severely injured, afterwards losing his ability to socialize with other lions and humans, and was shot by Adamson after fatally wounding an assistant. These events left Christian as the sole surviving member of the original pride. Over the course of a year, as George Adamson continued his work, the pride established itself in the region around Kora, with Christian as the head of the pride started by Boy.Christian: The Lion at the End of the World, documentary film. Reunions =1971= When John and Ace were informed by Adamson of Christian's successful reintroduction to the wild (reported in some newspaper articles to be in 1971, and by George Adamson to be 1972)Adamson, George. My Pride and Joy, caption to hugging reunion picture, page 224. they travelled to Kenya to visit Christian and were filmed in the documentary Christian, The Lion at World's End (released in the U.S. as Christian the Lion). According to the documentary, Adamson advised Rendall and Bourke that Christian might not remember them. The film shows the lion at first cautiously approach and then quickly leap playfully onto the two men, standing on his hind legs and wrapping his front legs around their shoulders, nuzzling their faces. The documentary also shows the lionesses, Mona and Lisa, and a foster cub named Supercub welcoming the two men. =1973= Rendall details a final, largely unfilmed reunion that occurred (reported in some newspaper articles to have been in 1974, and by George Adamson to have been in 1973).Adamson, My Pride and Joy, chapter 12 (1971‚Äì1973), page 231. By this time Christian was successfully defending his own pride, had cubs of his own and was about twice the size he was in the earlier reunion video. Adamson advised Rendall that it would most likely be a wasted trip as he had not seen Christian's pride for nine months. However, when he reached Kora, Christian and his pride had returned to Adamson's compound the day before their arrival. George Adamson counted the days without seeing Christian from the late spring 1973 final reunion. He notes in his book My Pride And Joy (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987) that after 97 days, he stopped counting. In media In 1971, Christian's owners published his story as A Lion Called Christian. This book was republished in 2009 following the spread of his story on YouTube. A video of the 1971 reunion, edited from the documentary, was first posted on a fan web site in 2002. From there it was picked up by a MySpace user and then picked up from MySpace and posted on YouTube where it became a viral video and worldwide sensation, more than 30 years after the event. As of July 2009, several versions of the video have been viewed millions of times on YouTube, one garnering over 18 million. Various news sources have since tracked down Rendall and Bourke for their current perspective on the events surrounding their life with Christian. In September 2008, Sony Pictures announced that it was interested in obtaining the rights to the story of Christian's life for the purpose of making a feature film.

Death  On February 28, 2000, Ford's business partner at Biofem, Inc., James Patrick Riley, was shot and wounded by a masked gunman at the company's office near the Irvine Spectrum. Police quickly discovered that the owner of the gunman's getaway van, Dino D'Saachs, made a phone call to Ford the morning of the attack. Following police questioning on March 2, Ford committed suicide with a shotgun at his Woodbridge home. His suicide note claimed he was innocent of the attempted murder, but added that there was information hidden in the house of interest to the police. When authorities searched the home, they discovered containers buried next to his swimming pool containing assault rifles and C-4 plastic explosives. In refrigerator at his home, were 266 bottles and vials of pathogens. Among them were the bacterial agents of Clostridium tetani and Clostridium difficile. According to the Orange County's Health Officer, the microorganisms were found in extremely poor condition. Some 83 files with medical records and personal items taken by Ford from his female patients were found as trophies hidden in the ground as well. Dr. Vikki Hufnagel who had been filing complaints about Ford to the California Medical Board CMB for years had been repeatedly threatened by Larry . Detective Victor Ray informed Vikki that a file existed in which Ford was planning to kill her. Hufnagel filed to the authorities and the CMB a formal complaint on 01/14/2013 to remove Ford's medical license and to fully investigate the 83 files as well as the cases of two women: Shane Gregory who was Ford's mistress until she came became ill and Tami Tippit (a set stylist) who became ill after a single business lunch with Ford. Ford went on to brag to others how he had infected them with various diseases. Mike Wallace of 60 minutes interviewed these women in June of 2002 in a segment titled \\"Dr. Death\\". Ms. Tippit succumbed from her illness in June 2006. Ford was in the news years earlier when he was shot in the UCLA parking lot and saw his shooter. It was alleged that Ford was shot by the husband of a patient he was having an affair with at the time. There is no evidence to suggest that these materials were being used to prepare a biological weapon, and neither of these bacteria are on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list of possible bioterrorism agents. Strikingly however, other official accounts circulated at the time of the evacuation and investigation, included finding anthrax on the property which is a threat to public health. Somehow, these accounts are no longer found in the OC Health Officer's report. City officials closed an elementary school and evacuated 48 Woodbridge families (about 250 residents) in the immediate area while they performed a thorough search of Ford's home. To this day the shooter of Mr. Riley has never been caught. With the death of Dr. Ford and no continued investigation little can be done to prove his connection to the shooting of Mr. Riley. Alleged ties to South African biological warfare After Ford killed himself, a number of newspapers alleged that he and Riley had corporate ties with biological warfare development in apartheid-era South Africa. Ford was also linked to Dr. Daniel Knobel, former chief medical officer for the South African Defence Force.

He also served simultaneously as commander in chief of U.S. Air Forces for both the U.S. Atlantic Command and U.S. Readiness Command. Biography Dixon was born in New York City in 1920. He graduated from Dartmouth College in June 1941 with a bachelor of arts degree in literature. In 1941 he entered pilot training in the Royal Canadian Air Force and in November 1942 was commissioned a pilot officer (second lieutenant equivalent) in the RCAF. He then graduated with an additional navigator rating from the RCAF Astro Navigation School. After completing Spitfire training at Dyce, Scotland, he was assigned to the 541 Squadron Royal Air Force a photo reconnaissance squadron at RAF Benson, England. World War II In September 1943, Dixon was transferred from the RCAF to the United States Army where he served in the U.S. Army Air Forces and assigned to the 7th Photographic Group, Eighth Air Force, European Theater of Operations. In 1944 Dixon assumed command of the 14th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, 7th Photographic Group, which had Mark XI Spitfires, P-38 Lightnings and P-51 Mustangs. He flew missions in four different aircraft for a total of 235 combat flying hours in 65 missions. He was shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire while doing reconnaissance of the oil refinery at Merseburg, Germany in 1944. He was captured and remained a prisoner of war until liberated by U.S. Forces in May 1945. Korea After hospitalization, Dixon served at Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Rapid City Army Air Field, South Dakota. He was an instructor at the West Point Preparatory School in 1947 and then was assigned as group and wing personnel officer for the 82d Fighter Wing, Grenier Field, New Hampshire. From November 1948 to 1953, Dixon served in the Directorate of Personnel at Headquarters, Strategic Air Command. He next served 11 months in Korea with the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing as wing inspector and then as commander of the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. He completed 28 combat missions before the Korean armistice. Dixon returned to the United States in 1954. He was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force and subsequently served as assistant to the deputy chief of staff, plans and operations, for National Security Council affairs. In this capacity he was Air Force action officer with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the U.S. Department of State and the National Security Council. He graduated from the Air War College in 1959 and was assigned to Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), Paris, France, as staff missile planner. Reassigned to the Pentagon in 1962, he served as assistant deputy director for war plans and later as assistant for joint and National Security Council matters, deputy chief of staff, plans and operations. In this latter capacity, Dixon was the Air Force planner for Joint Chiefs of Staff matters. In September 1965 Dixon was assigned to the 45th Air Division, Strategic Air Command, at Loring Air Force Base, Maine, as an air division commander responsible for B-52/KC-135 wings at Loring AFB, Dow AFB, Ernest Harmon AFB and Goose Air Base. From July 1967 until July 1969, he was assigned as assistant deputy chief of staff, personnel for military personnel, and Commander, Air Force Military Personnel Center, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. While in this assignment, he received the 1969 Eugene M. Zuckert Management Award. Vietnam In July 1969 Dixon was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam as Vice Commander, Seventh Air Force. He flew 36 combat missions during this tour in Southeast Asia. On August 1, 1970, he was promoted to lieutenant general and assumed the duties of deputy chief of staff, personnel, Headquarters U.S. Air Force. He served in that position until October 1, 1973, at which time he was promoted to general and assumed command of Tactical Air Command (TAC). During his tenure as COMTAC, General Robert Dixon revamped the way TAC personnel trained. It was under his command that the Red Flag training exercises were started at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in order to more realistically simulate the expected combat environment and to reduce the high casualty rate experienced during the early phases of offensive operations in the Vietnam War. Another driver was the lessons learned during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where the use of Soviet-supplied integrated air defense systems by the Egyptians and the Syrians had severely restricted the capability of the Israeli Air Force to support the ground forces. Dixon developed a close friendship with the commander of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Benny Peled that facilitated the prompt supply of US replacement systems to Israel and also of Israeli-captured Soviet equipment to the US. Dixon also decentralized aircraft maintenance in order to improve aircraft availability and combat sortie rates. Post-military Dixon retired from the military on May 1, 1978 and died on March 21, 2003. Awards and decorations General Dixon was a Command Pilot with more than 6,000 flying hours. His military decorations and awards include the Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star, Air Medal with 11 oak leaf clusters, Purple Heart, British Distinguished Flying Cross and French Croix d'Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur. *60px Distinguished Service Cross *60px Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters *60px Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster *60px Distinguished Flying Cross *60px Bronze Star *60px Purple Heart *60px Air Medal with 11 oak leaf clusters *60px British Distinguished Flying Cross *60px Legion of Honor References See also *List of commanders of Tactical Air Command Category:1920 births Category:2003 deaths Category:United States Air Force generals Category:Royal Canadian Air Force officers Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom) Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II Category:American air force personnel of the Korean War Category:American air force personnel of the Vietnam War Category:American Korean War pilots Category:Military personnel from New York City Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:Officiers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:Recipients of the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Order of the Sword (United States) ","title":"Robert J.

It can be used to estimate the number of solutions of an equation, and is closely connected to fixed-point theory. When one solution of an equation is easily found, degree theory can often be used to prove existence of a second, nontrivial, solution. There are different types of degree for different types of maps: e.g. for maps between Banach spaces there is the Brouwer degree in Rn, the Leray-Schauder degree for compact mappings in normed spaces, the coincidence degree and various other types. There is also a degree for continuous maps between manifolds.

Dobson (December 30, 1949 ‚Äì December 26, 2015) was a Northern Irish- American pastor, at one time an executive for the Moral Majority. After becoming disillusioned with the Christian Right, he became the pastor of a megachurch in Grand Rapids, Michigan and a nationally known author and speaker, especially after being diagnosed with ALS in 2000. Biography In 1964, Dobson moved to the United States from Northern Ireland. He earned a BA (1970) and an MA (1972) from Bob Jones University and an EdD (1986) in higher education from the University of Virginia.Marquis Who's Who, 2008. At 23, Dobson became Dean of Men at Liberty University, \\"but before long he was also teaching New Testament survey, coaching the soccer team, and taking on more administrative duties. In time, Dobson was named vice president for student life as well as associate pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church.\\" When the Moral Majority was organized in June 1979, Jerry Falwell named Dobson to the board.Dean Merrill, \\"The Education of Ed Dobson,\\" Christianity Today, August 11, 1997. Three years later, the premiere issue of Fundamentalist Journal listed him as one of two senior editors; he became editor-in-chief two and a half years later and served as a voice of the Moral Majority. Dobson and another Liberty faculty member, Ed Hindson, effectively ghost-wrote Falwell's The Fundamentalist Phenomenon (1981).Cal Thomas and Ed Dobson, Blinded by Might: Can the Religious Right Save America? (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1999). Dobson said that they produced \\"the material so he could edit it....we were putting Jerry's political agenda in writing.\\" By the late 1980s, Dobson had drifted away from fundamentalism toward mainstream evangelicalism and decided that the rationale behind the Moral Majority had been wrongheaded and that to a significant degree cultural problems could not be remedied through the political process.Blinded by Might, 15. In 1987, Dobson left Liberty (just as Falwell became responsible for the empire of failed televangelist Jim Bakker), and Dobson took the pastorate of Calvary Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he remained for eighteen years (1987‚Äì2005).Liberty University website. During Dobson's pastorate, Calvary planted Mars Hill Bible Church, led by Rob Bell. Christianity Today website. In 1993, Moody Bible Institute named him \\"Pastor of the Year,\\" and Dobson served as an advisory editor for Christianity Today. While senior pastor of Calvary Church, Dobson mentored a number of young men who had recently entered the ministry or were considering doing so, including Rob Bell, Michael Hidalgo, Jim Samra, Brett Werner, and Marvin Williams. After Dobson's retirement, he mentored others in Grand Rapids. After Dobson was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) in 2000, he wrote Prayers and Promises when Facing a Life-Threatening Illness.Edward G. Dobson, Prayers and Promises when Facing a Life-Threatening Illness (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2007), 13. A short, but widely viewed, video was made of his struggle in illness. In Spring 2008, Grand Rapids Theological Seminary dedicated a \\"Dobson Study Center\\" in its classroom building to honor Dobson's long pastorate and television ministry in Grand Rapids. In January 2009, Dobson was interviewed on Good Morning America because he had attempted to live a year as Jesus had, observing Sabbath and Jewish holidays and festivals. Dobson said that he had voted for Barack Obama on the grounds that Obama \\"was closer to Jesus's teachings.\\" Some religious conservatives criticized Dobson for occasionally drinking beer while testifying about his Christian faith. Dobson's son, Kent, became pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church (formerly pastored by Rob Bell, whom Ed Dobson had mentored) but resigned in November 2015, telling the congregation that he was \\"not drawn to the orthodox or the mainstream or the status quo.\\" In May 2013, Dobson's son Daniel, a U.S. Army veteran of Iraq war, came out publicly as a gay Christian.

They are heading to a Halloween party but there's a catch: the man Jonathan killed is back in a new, horrific form. Lynn and Jonathan meet some party goers, like Tammy, twins Grazer and Spinner, Tammy's ex, Lance, the sexy-blonde Rachel, Lance's friend, Brian, best friends Yolanda & Vicki and the old carver, Ben Wicket, as well as other party-goers. After a fight with Lance, Jonathan starts thinking that Alec is there at the party, but chooses to ignore this. At night, Rachel has sex in her van with Lance's friend, A.J, but he leaves angrily after Rachel hits him. Rachel goes looking for A.J, but when she doesn't find him, goes back to her van. However, she's attacked, by a supposed Alec, who carves her face. Later, Brian reveals to Tammy that Lance was \\"being a dick\\". Shortly after Tammy leaves, Brian is attacked by a killer, who makes him walk backward, making Brian impale himself with an electric drill. Jonathan is stalked several times by Ben, but then escapes. Later, Yolanda and Vicki find Rachel who is barely alive and flee, warning Grazer and Spinner, but they are too drunk and refuse to believe them. Later, Spinner leaves and Grazer is struck with a scythe, before getting decapitated. Jonathan disappears, and Lynn and Tammy go and try to find him. Lynn meets Lance, who attempts to rape her, but she escapes before Lance is stabbed to death. Tammy is pursued by the killer, before getting trapped in a bear trap, and stabbed to death. Lynn and Jonathan meet, where they later find Tammy's dead body. Alec and Jonathan meet, and they confront each other, until Jonathan stabs Alec to death, the same way he did in the prank. Later, it is revealed that \\"Alec\\" is Ben Wicket, and it was Jonathan's trauma the one that made him think it was Alec. The next morning, the police arrive. Shortly after questioning, Jonathan and Lynn are ready to leave, but Jonathan takes a sudden shift into Alec's shape, revealing that he was the killer, and that Ben had been trying to kill him because of that. The movie ends with Jonathan stabbing Lynn to death.

Although originally built to handle coal exports, the port has become South Africa's premier bulk port, handling other dry bulk in addition to coal, as well as liquid bulk and breakbulk cargoes. It is also South Africa's most modern port. History The idea for a new harbour north of Durban began as far back as 1902 when a Cathcart W. Methen, Harbour Engineer, Durban, conducted a survey and advised the Natal Colony government in 1903, that Richards Bay would be a better choice than St Lucia. The idea was again revised in 1921 when a proposed harbour was investigated by a group of engineers at Kosi or Sodwana Bay's. Sodwana's suitability was again investigated in 1922 by Sir George Buchanan. The two former bays were again investigated in 1923, this time by Jan Smuts. The idea for a northern harbour would again be revisited in the 1950s when Prime Minister D.F. Malan visited by air reconnaissance. By 1965, the then Minister of Transport Ben Schoeman decided after visiting Kosi and Sodwana Bay's, that Richards Bay would be the best choice. Four reasons were given for the choice. It had a protected bay; the hard material was at a depth allowing the creation of a deep bay; the ability to integrate the existing railway infrastructure and a shorter rail distance to the industrialised Transvaal interior. In 1967, surveys began of the 3,050 ha lagoon. Aerial photography took place, off-shore soundings were made by the South African Navy's hydrographical department while the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) studied the coastal morphology, collected data on wave heights, directions, tides, currents, sediment transport and studies on river discharge into the lagoon. Three rivers flowed into the lagoon, the Umhlatuzi, the Nsezi and the Manzamyana with the depth of the water in the lagoon being around a metre. The ground below the lagoon water was very soft making proposed dredging easier with the hard rock at a depth making the proposed port a deep water harbour. The existing sea entrance to the lagoon was found to be a natural underwater gorge that was filled with loose material and so made it ideal as a channel for ships to enter the proposed harbour if two breakwaters were built. Despite no harbour or facilities, in January 1969, earthworks began for the building of the Alusaf Smelter, the country's first aluminium smelter. 2,100,000 m¬≥ of soil was brought into the swampy site and 40 km of piles driven into the ground. Concrete pouring began in June 1969 with Aluisse the project managers, Roberts for the construction and Dorman Long the steelworks. It would open on 1 April 1971 with initial processing capacity set at 52,000 tons and 300,000 tons if expanded. Alumina was imported from Australia and transported by rail to Richards Bay. In the middle of 1971, boring tests indicated poor ground in certain areas of the proposed harbour that necessitated changes to the location of some infrastructure. By November 1971 the design and construction tenders were released and closed in March 1972. May 1972 saw the South African parliament passed an Act that authorised the construction of the harbour. Ten tenders were received and a contract was awarded in May 1972 to a Dutch, Belgian and German consortium worth R108,606,402.50 for a period of five years. The first stage of development was the construction of quay-walls, to eventually berth bulk-carriers of up to 250,000 tons dw, with the completion deadline being April 1976. The Transvaal Coal Owners Association proposed to export coal of 9.1 million tons from the Eastern Transvaal through the new port to Japan. The railway infrastructure needed upgrading or new lines built. The current rail line between Ermelo and Vryheid was upgraded and a new 90 km line from Broodsnyersplaas and the coalfields to Ermelo was built. The third main upgrade, was a new rail line from Vryheid to Empangeni, just outside Richards Bay, which would 210 km in length, with 10.5 km of tunnelling and 67 bridges or viaducts over several rivers including one over the Umfolozi River of a 39.6 m span. Coal terminal =Location= The Richards Bay Coal Terminal is positioned at one of the world's deep sea ports, and is able to handle large ships and subsequent large volumes. As such, it has gained a reputation for operating efficiently and reliably. The 276 hectare site currently boasts a quay 2.2 kilometres long with six berths and four ship loaders. Currently, the terminal has a storage capacity of 8.2 million tons of coal and is serviced by seven stacker reclaimers, two stackers and a reclaimer. =Capacity= In September 2006, RBCT set a new world record by loading and exporting 409,809 tons of coal in a 24-hour period at an annualised rate of 149.17 million tons per annum (Mt/a). Potential throughput is to reach 91 million tons a year by the first half of 2009. In 2007 annual throughput was 66.12 million tons, despite a capacity of 76 million tons. It was largely due to rail deliveries failing to reach expectations.  Expansion  RBCT commenced its Phase V expansion project in September 2006, which was completed in May 2010 and rose the throughput to the current capacity. Discussion about available export capacity to emerging black coal miners in South Africa is still going on. Therefore, Transnet and Grindrod started to build up coal export capacity through the Richards Bay Terminal (RBT), the dry bulk terminal of Richards Bay. The capacity of this facility will be increased to 4.5 million tons a year, which will give together with 4 million ton capacity reserved in the RBCT a total capacity of 9.5 million tons a year, which should be sufficient to cover the export needs of the black miners in the next years. In January 2012, the Swazilink rail project was announced, which would remove general freight traffic from the Richards Bay line and allow more coal trains to Richards Bay Coal Terminal. Completion is foreseen for 2019 or 2020.

Types of mixed agonist/antagonist include receptor ligands that act as agonist for some receptor types and antagonist for others or agonist in some tissues while antagonist in others (also known as selective receptor modulators).  Synaptic receptors  For synaptic receptors, an agonist is a compound that increases the activation of the receptor by binding directly to it or by increasing the amount of time neurotransmitters are in the synaptic cleft. An antagonist is a compound that has the opposite effect of an agonist. It decreases the activation of a synaptic receptor by binding and blocking neurotransmitters from binding or by decreasing the amount of time neurotransmitters are in the synaptic cleft. These actions can be achieved via multiple mechanisms. A common mechanism for agonists is reuptake inhibition, where the agonist blocks neurotransmitters from reentering the pre-synaptic axon terminal. This gives the neurotransmitter more time in the synaptic cleft to act on the synaptic receptors. Conversely, antagonists often bind directly to receptors in the synaptic cleft, effectively blocking neurotransmitters from binding. At the alpha adrenoceptors, (R)-3-nitrobiphenyline is an Œ±2C selective agonist as well as being a weak antagonist at the Œ± and Œ± subtypes.  Agonist-antagonist opioids  The best known agonist-antagonists are opioids. Examples of such opioids are: * pentazocine, agonist at the kappa (Œ∫) and sigma (œÉ) and has a weak antagonist action at the mu opioid receptor (Œº) * butorphanol, partial agonist at Œº- and a pure agonist at Œ∫-opioid receptor and antagonist activity at the delta opioid receptor (Œ¥) * nalbuphine, Œ∫-agonist/Œº-antagonist analgesic *Buprenorphine, partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor (Œº) *cyclo[Pro-Sar- Phe-D-Phe], an orally active macrocyclic tetrapeptide with mixed opioid receptor agonism-antagonism Agonist‚Äìantagonist opioids usually have a ceiling effect ‚Äì over particular dose they don't increase their potency. Hence agonist‚Äìantagonist opioids have a lower addiction potential but also lower analgesic efficacy and are more likely to produce psychotomimetic effects. Agonist‚Äìantagonist opioids that block delta while activating mu opioid receptors produce analgesia without the development of tolerance.

There are (at this writing) four distinct continuities in which Strawberry Shortcake's adventures take place: The original 1980s version, the 2003 reboot, the 2009/2010 reboot, and the 2018 reboot. Many of Strawberry Shortcake's friends appear in more than one continuity, and their appearance and/or characterization can vary greatly between versions. Distinct traits will be noted in each of the circas in which a character happens to appear. 1980-1985 =Strawberry Shortcake= Strawberry Shortcake is the protagonist and the titular character of The World of Strawberry Shortcake franchise. She is a bright and energetic little girl with red hair and freckles with a big, adorable smile, said to be about 6 years old. She usually wears a red dress with a white pinafore, and a large pink bonnet decorated with strawberries. In the 1980s, Strawberry Shortcake and nearly all of her friends wore green-and-white stripes in the design of their costume, usually involving (but not limited to) striped stockings. In her earliest adventures, Strawberry's home was a shortcake surrounded by well- tended strawberry vines, but in 1983 she moved into her \\"Berry Happy Home\\", a large and ornate mansion. Strawberry is kind, resourceful, and always ready to help a friend in need. Other than her friends, Strawberry Shortcake also loves her cat, Custard. Her adversaries are the Purple Pieman and later, his colleague Sour Grapes. =Huckleberry Pie= Huckleberry Pie is one of Strawberry Shortcake's friends, who lives, not surprisingly, in a large Huckleberry Pie-shaped cabin, just down the road from Strawberry Shortcake's house. Huck bore more than a passing resemblance to Mark Twain's literary creation Huckleberry Finn, from his straw hat and overalls to his tendencies towards fishing and general laziness. Huckleberry Pie was, for the most part, the only boy character in a female-dominated franchise. In the 1980s series, Huckleberry Pie was voiced by a female actress, Julie McWhirter. =Blueberry Muffin= Blueberry Muffin has been Strawberry Shortcake's friend since the very beginning. In the 1980s, the character was depicted with blue hair in pigtails. Speaking with a Southern drawl, she was also known as being more than a bit forgetful. Both of these traits were downplayed as the series progressed. Her pet mouse was named Cheesecake. =Apple Dumplin'= Apple Dumplin' was the first of several \\"baby\\" characters introduced in the vast world of Strawberry Shortcake. Smaller and less independent than the older Strawberryland kids, Apple has also proven to be more than capable of taking care of herself when the situation warrants. Apple's hair is bright orange and she wore a yellow bonnet with small green polka dots. Her beloved pet, that she often rode on, is Tea Time Turtle. Apple Dumplin' wore a yellow sleeveless onesie with a large apple on it, and green-and-white striped booties. =Raspberry Tart= Raspberry Tart wasn't exactly mean or spiteful in her earliest appearances, but she could deliver a cutting, tactless comment before her brain could catch up with her tart tongue. Gifted with a full head of bright pink curls, the Raspberry Tart doll produced by Kenner depicted an unusual interpretation of her standard Strawberryland dress-and-bloomers outfit: both items were combined into a one-piece playsuit-type outfit. Her pet monkey was named Rhubarb. =Plum Pudding= The last of Strawberry Shortcake's original 1980s friends, Plum Pudding was the bespectacled genius of the group. A surprisingly non-token second boy character in Strawberry's early adventures, Plum Pudding vanished from Strawberryland in 1982, only to return to the series in 1984 as an intelligent female. Strawberry Shortcake seemed not to notice. Plum remained Strawberry Shortcake's scientific adviser through the franchise's disbanding in 1985. Her pet is an owl called Elderberry. =Orange Blossom= Strawberry Shortcake met an urban artist Orange Blossom during her trip to Big Apple City in the 1981 TV special. Orange Blossom followed Strawberry home at the conclusion of her trip, and has been at her side ever since. Orange Blossom's pet butterfly, Marmalade, actually predates the introduction of Orange Blossom's character, and the two were merchandised as a team a year before \\"Pets On Parade\\" supplied every resident of Strawberryland with an animal companion. =Lemon Meringue= Another of Strawberry Shortcake's new friends from her trip to Big Apple City, Lemon Meringue is a primping beauty known around the city as a famous model. With curly lemon-yellow hair and green eyes, she is nothing if not photogenic. When pressed for details, however, she admits that her \\"pictures\\" are mostly owned by members of her immediate family. It seems unlikely that a glamorous girl such as Lemon Meringue would choose a frog for a pet. But it is actually because Frapp√© in no way competes with Lemon's beauty that they get along so well. =T.N. Honey= T.N. Honey, a brilliant British scientist, is a rather obscure character in the Strawberry Shortcake pantheon. \\"Big Apple City\\" marked her singular appearance in a Strawberry Shortcake adventure, although she was also featured in occasional American Greetings card illustrations. T.N. used her scientific expertise to repair Strawberry's oven when it befell sabotage at the hands of The Purple Pie Man at the Big TV Bake-Off. At the end of the \\"Big Apple City\\" adventure, T.N. is seen journeying to Strawberryland along with other newcomers such as Orange Blossom and Lemon Meringue. But T.N. Honey was never seen again. Plum Puddin', Strawberry's other glasses-wearing friend, disappeared around this same time until 1984. She was voiced by Julie McWhirter. =Apricot= Apricot is a little white-haired baby with an unusual vocabulary of oversized words. Apricot and her pet bunny Hopsalot lived in Big Apple City, down the hall from Lemon Meringue and T.N. Honey, and like Meringue and Honey, she relocated to Strawberryland at the conclusion of Strawberry Shortcake's visit. =Butter Cookie= Butter Cookie is probably Strawberry Shortcake's youngest friend ever, a baby just learning to crawl. As such, she hasn't yet developed any interesting personality traits, but is plenty adorable nonetheless. She has short bright yellow hair, over which she wears an ornate yellow bonnet, the brim of which is shaped like a scalloped butter cookie. She wears a white, cookie-printed nightdress, which ties into a bow at her feet. Her pet is a yellow teddy bear called Jelly Bear. =Lime Chiffon= Lime Chiffon was a bubbly and flighty ballerina in the 1980s series, always dancing and spinning to and fro with her parrot, Parfait, who often seemed to be the intellectual one of the pair. Lime Chiffon wore a pink hat with a green bow on it, over her bright green short curly hair. She also wore striped tights, a green dress and green shoes. =Cherry Cuddler= Cherry Cuddler was another baby character, known for her propensity for hugging and being hugged by her friends. Cherry Cuddler wore a bonnet that looked like a cherry, over her pink short curly hair. Cherry wore striped tights, a white dress with cherries on it and soft pink slippers. Her pet is a goose called Gooseberry who also wore a cute little red bonnet. =Angel Cake= Overly polite Angel Cake seemed to take the \\"Angel\\" portion of her name a bit too seriously. Never missing an opportunity to say \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\", she even went so far as to play the harp and wear a gold halo- shaped headband in her hair. Angel Cake's hair was often depicted as a lavender color in the greeting card illustrations and the cartoon, but the dolls and toys made by Kenner had white hair. Angel Cake imagined herself as having a weight problem, seeing as angel cakes are supposed to be \\"light\\", but was also seen constantly eating candy and ice cream. Her direct quote: \\"...If you don't think about it, the calories don't count.\\" She adopted her pet skunk Souffl√© as part of the action of Strawberry Shortcake's \\"Pets on Parade\\" adventure, and quickly put him on a \\"diet\\" as well. =Almond Tea= Almond Tea was one of the many new friends met by Strawberry Shortcake during her trip around the world immediately prior to the 1983 TV special. A native of China Cup, Almond Tea returned the favor and visited Strawberryland to help Strawberry Shortcake celebrate her move into her Berry Happy Home with a huge housewarming party. Her short purple hair and vested pants outfit led some customers in 1983 to believe that she was a boy! However, she was issued in 1984 in the \\"Party Pleasers\\" doll line in a fancy party dress, firmly quashing those rumors. A provocative and unexplored facet of Almond Tea's personality is that she is said to possess psychic powers, and was able to, on occasion, see glimpses of the future. Her pet Marza Panda had a similar gift, only it worked in reverse, and only allowed him to see flashbacks. =Caf√© Ol√©= Caf√© Ol√© is Strawberry Shortcake's friend from the Mexico-based Mexicocoa leg of her round-the-world trip. She is said to be adept at handicrafts such as weaving. She wears a pink and white sombrero style looking hat over her auburn curly hair, tights, a white dress and a poncho over it. Her pet is a burro called Burrito. =Crepe Suzette= Crepe Suzette met Strawberry Shortcake during the latter's visit to the French-inspired Pear-ee prior to the 1983 TV special. She later traveled to Strawberryland to surprise her new friend at her \\"Berry Happy Home\\" housewarming party. She is quintessentially French, and speaks English with a thick French accent. Billed as the best cook of all of Strawberry Shortcake's friends, Crepe has also been described as a bit of a perfectionist. She pushed the thematic green-and-white stripes of the Strawberry Shortcake character's stockings to the limit, wearing them as a full-length leotard as part of her street dancer's costume. She wears a little tan beret over very curly blue hair. Her pet is a blue French poodle called Eclair. =Mint Tulip= Mint Tulip was a pretty girl from the Netherlands- inspired Hollandaise. Mint Tulip wears tights, a green dress, a white tulip flower shaped hat over blonde hair and wooden clogs. In the 1980s, her flower gardens were said to be the finest in all Strawberryland, and her pet is a duck called Marsh Mallard, who wears a little green hat with a marshmallow on it. Mint Tulip was featured in the 1985 \\"Berrykins\\" line of Kenner Dolls. =Lem and Ada= Lem and Ada are a pair of twins from the Pickle-Dilly Circus, based on England's Piccadilly Circus. Although the same size as other babies in the series, the twins seemed to be especially precocious. Not only did they speak quite well, they even finished each other's sentences. It was difficult for residents of Strawberryland to tell the twins apart; only their pet sheepdog Sugar Woofer seemed to know for sure. Lem wore a yellow and green cap, a bib with a lemon on it, and yellow checkered britches that looked like diapers with side knots. Ada wore a big green hair bow, a bib with a lime on it and white britches with dots on them. =Peach Blush= Peach Blush debuted near the end of Strawberry Shortcake's initial run in the 1980s. A delicate and dramatic Southern belle, from \\"The Land of The Magnolias\\", Peach Blush turned up in Strawberryland along with the returning Plum Pudding, and the title character of the special, Baby-Needs-a-Name. Peach Blush had full curly pink hair, and wore a yellow hat, pink gingham dress, and tights in the \\"Party Pleaser\\" series. She also appeared in the \\"Berrykins\\" series, with long curly pink hair with a big white bow, a pink skirt and white top along with the Berrykin multi-colored striped tights. Peach Blush's pet lamb, Melonie Belle, appeared in limited media (a Kenner coloring book) under her original name, \\"Honey Lamb\\". =Baby-Without-a-Name= Baby-Without-a-Name was the last of the younger characters to be introduced in the classic 1980s version of Strawberry Shortcake. She wore a pink bonnet over her blonde hair and a pink dress. Her gentle nature endeared her to everyone who met her, and she had but two wishes in her young heart: to have a pet, and to have a name, for no one had been able to think of one for her. One of these wishes came true during Strawberry Shortcake's annual camping trip in the 1984 special, when the baby encountered the unusual but adorable \\"monster\\" Fig Boot, a play on Bigfoot. Fig Boot is an oversized (as far as Strawberryland pets are concerned) purple reptilian creature, but is depicted as a baby of whatever kind of animal he is. The Baby and Fig Boot bonded instantly, and, following the foiling of a plot by the Purple Pie Man and Sour Grapes to exploit the creature, remain inseparable. While in the official storyline, the Baby's quest for a proper name went unfulfilled, a Baby Needs-A-Name baby doll released by Kenner came with an ID bracelet with stickers with four suggestions: \\"Lullaberry Pie\\", \\"Candy Kiss\\", Cutie Fruitie\\", and \\"Kissletoe\\". In a rather odd set of circumstances, this 14\\" \\"Blow-Kiss\\" baby doll was the only merchandise released of Baby Needs-A-Name. Kenner released no miniatures of the character, and stranger still, they didn't produce a 3-5/8\\" doll to go with the figure of Fig Boot sold that year for the Strawberry Shortcake doll line. Considering that the Baby was the title star of the 1984 yearly TV Special (\\"Strawberry Shortcake and The Baby Without a Name\\"), it seems very much like a series of missed opportunities. =Banana Twirl= The final friend of Strawberry Shortcake to be introduced in the 1980s, Banana Twirl was an energetic exercise enthusiast. Because she came along so late in the line, she was never featured in American Greetings artwork, and remains noteworthy due to the scarcity of what merchandise of her was actually made. Unlike the other characters, she did not own a pet. =Mr. Sun= Mr. Sun is just that‚Äîthe sun in the sky, anthropomorphized into a friendly character with a face, who keeps a watchful eye on most all the goings-on in Strawberryland. As such, he also officiated as the narrator of the six 1980s-era Strawberry Shortcake TV Specials, and on more than one occasion acted as the deus ex machina means of resolving Strawberry Shortcake's storyline conflict therein. Mr. Sun was voiced by Romeo Muller in the first three specials, and was voiced by Chris Wiggins in the final three shows. In the more recent Strawberry Shortcake revival, the sun has been depicted with a smiling face, but has yet to interact with the characters of Strawberryland. =Lucky Bug= Lucky Bug is a tiny ladybug. Normally merely a benign observer of the goings-on in Strawberryland (he can be seen in much American Greetings artwork, perched inobtrusively on a leaf), Lucky Bug was enlisted by Huckleberry Pie to spy on Strawberry Shortcake in the initial TV special, in order to learn what she wanted for her birthday. Lucky Bug communicates with a series of musical buzzes, which are well understood by the inhabitants of Strawberryland, even including the Purple Pie Man. =Escargot= Years and years before the internet and e-mail made the term \\"Snail Mail\\" popular, Escargot is believed to have originated the term, to describe his own extremely slow method of postal delivery around Strawberryland. An enormous snail with a French accent, Escargot was voiced by Bob Holt, and appeared in the first two Strawberry Shortcake Specials of the 1980s. He was merchandised by Kenner as a plastic toy, which pulled a berry cart behind him as his head moved from side to side. =Flitter-Bit= While Strawberry Shortcake's friend Orange Blossom has a small, delicate butterfly for a pet, Strawberryland also sports butterflies of the enormous variety, such as Flitter-Bit. This obvious disparity of size doesn't faze the inhabitants of Strawberryland in the slightest. A gigantic yellow-and- green butterfly, large enough for the residents of Strawberryland to ride on his back, Flitter-Bit comprises Strawberryland Airlines, and flew Strawberry Shortcake from Strawberryland to the bright lights of Big Apple City. A bright plastic Flitter-Bit toy was produced by Kenner in 1981, the year that he made his sole animated appearance in the \\"Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City\\" special. Another, smaller solid plastic version was included with the Strawberry Shortcake Play-Doh playset. Recently, however, large yellow butterflies that greatly resemble Flitter-Bit were featured in Strawberry Shortcake's 2006 \\"Sweet Dreams Movie\\". =Tamale= Tamale is a large, furry Mexican mole, with an apparent poor sense of direction. While tunnelling underground (as moles do) to Acapulco, Tamale somehow surfaced in Big Apple City, just in time to assist Strawberry Shortcake and her new friend Orange Blossom avoid a sabotaged traffic light, by digging a tunnel to Orange Blossom's home in Spinach Village. Like many other supporting characters featured in the \\"Big Apple City\\" adventure (T.N. Honey, Horseradish), Tamale decided to relocate to Strawberryland following Strawberry Shortcake's heart- warming description of her small-town life. However, for reasons that remain unknown, following this mass migration, none of these characters were ever seen again. For reasons that remain unclear, Tamale has also been billed under the unlikely name \\"Guaca-Mole\\" in some media. His appearance on one of a set of 1981-circa Strawberry Shortcake trading cards is as close to being merchandised as Tamale/Guaca-Mole ever got. =Horseradish= Prior to Maple Stirrup, Strawberry Shortcake's first horse acquaintance was a buck-toothed blue horse called Horseradish. Horseradish pulled a Hansom Cab in Big Apple City, and delivered Strawberry and her growing retinue of friends to her engagement at The Little Theatre Off Times Pear, to compete in the Big TV Bake-Off. While he was seen with many other characters journeying to Strawberryland at the end of the TV special, Horseradish never appeared again following this adventure, and he was not merchandised as a toy. =Coco Nutwork= Coco Nutwork is a balding middle-aged executive, \\"Vice President in Charge of Everything\\" of CCN-TV, the TV studio that sponsored the Big TV Bake- Off. Billed as \\"The One-Man Network\\", Coco operated the cameras, ran the production booth, was the entire orchestra, did voice-over announcements, emceed, and even dressed in drag as a lovely spokes-model. Good-natured but weak-minded, Coco befell hypnotism and mind-control at the fiendish hands of The Purple Pie Man, but came to upon tasting the actual entries in the Bake- Off. Despite expressing an interest in giving up the \\"Brat Race\\" and relocating to Strawberryland, and even giving up his job(s) at the TV Station, Coco Nutwork was NOT seen accompanying Strawberry Shortcake and her new friends back home in the closing scene of the Special. =Berry Busy Bug= Berry Busy Bug is some sort of strange purple insect, with six legs (one pair functions as hands) and a long squiggly tail. He pushes a wheelbarrow as he pulls a series of flower-shaped trailers behind him, merrily transporting Strawberry Shortcake and her friends to and fro. If the scale of the toy made of Berry Busy Bug in 1982 is to be believed, he is arguably the largest known creature in all Strawberryland, for he towers over the Miniature figurines for which he was marketed as a vehicle/accessory. As a character, however, Berry Busy Bug is absolutely minor. A walk-on cameo appearance in the \\"Pets On Parade\\" adventure is all the storyline treatment he ever received. =Philbert Wormly III= Philbert Wormly III is a dapper British inchworm, of the larger- than-average variety. Clad in a top hat, bow tie and tweed suit, Philbert also wears an ornate saddle with twin sidebaskets, so that Strawberry Shortcake can ride on his back, as he bounces along at a surprisingly quick pace. He answers to the sound of a whistle, as though he were performing a taxi service, and has been known to \\"spook\\" when someone brings up the subject of fishing. His toy was billed as the \\"Berry Merry Worm\\". =Maple Stirrup= Maple Stirrup was the first Strawberry Shortcake horse character to be merchandised as a toy. A warm brown pony with a bright green-and-white striped mane and tail, Maple Stirrup pulled a light two-wheeled carriage called The Oatsmobile. And yes, this little horse did indeed smell of maple syrup. A mention of Maple Stirrup was made in the 2003-series Strawberry Shortcake GBA Game, \\"Ice Cream Island Riding Camp\\", along with many other obscure fillies. However, it is unclear if American Greetings was planning to revive this filly for the 2003 franchise revival. =The Berry Princess and The Berrykins= The Berry Princess is a beautiful fairy who possesses amazing mystical powers. With a wave of her magic wand, she can appear and disappear in a shower of sparkles, cleanse the skies of pollution, and even make hair grow to fantastic lengths instantly! Supposedly the Guardian of The Berrykins, a group of elf-like beings who are charged with giving fruits and berries their sweet fragrances, the Berry Princess nonetheless entrusted her charges into the care of Strawberry Shortcake and her friends in 1985, which was the last year that Strawberry was produced in the 1980s. The Peculiar Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak was undeniably captivated by her beauty and charm, much to the disgust of Sour Grapes. The known Berrykins are: *Strawberrykin *Blueberrykin (Toy planned, but not produced) *Raspberrykin (Toy planned, but not produced) *Orange Berrykin *Lemon Berrykin (Toy planned, but not produced) *Lime Berrykin (Toy planned, but not produced) *Plum Berrykin *Peach Berrykin *Banana Berrykin and *Mint Berrykin =The Purple Pieman= The primary antagonist of the show, the Peculiar Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak was introduced in Strawberry Shortcake's first adventure, The World of Strawberry Shortcake, where he succeeded in flooding Strawberryland and stealing all the berries in the valley. This was the closest the Pieman ever came to a decisive victory over Strawberry Shortcake. From there, his crafty machinations devolved into half-baked \\"get rich quick\\" schemes which always seemed to involve making off with something of Strawberry Shortcake's. In Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City, it is said that he has an 'evil conscience', and he often refers to himself in the third person, doing a tap dance and chanting an odd fanfare while doing so: \\"Yah-tah-tah-tah-tah-tah-tah-tah, tah-tah-tah- tah! Cha!\\" The Purple Pieman lives in a ramshackle tower of oversized cookware dubbed The Pie Tin Palace, situated high atop Strawberryland on Porcupine Peak. The Pieman possessed a magic pie tin, which he used to spy on the residents of Strawberryland. While he was a clever liar and cheat, and a convincing master of disguise, he was an admittedly poor baker. He dislikes snakes and Sour Grapes' singing, but hates Strawberry Shortcake's 'Berry Talk' (that is, to substitute \\"berry\\" for any word that rhymes) above all else. Mr. Sun describes him as a \\"misanthropic fathead with a skinny physique\\" in Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City. The Purple Pieman has a flock of purple Berry Birds, which he used to steal berries and eavesdrop on the denizens of Strawberryland. The largest Berry Bird was called Captain Cackle. =Sour Grapes= Sour Grapes was introduced in the third Strawberry Shortcake special, Strawberry Shortcake: Pets on Parade, In 1982. In the special, she introduced herself as the Purple Pieman's old partner in crime. She sang when excited, much to the Pieman's chagrin, as her singing was loud and off-key (Her 'song' was introduced as a \\"yogurt-curdling yodel\\" upon her first appearance, but was later modified into a shrill operatic pronouncement). She was very fond of her pet snake, Dregs, whom she frequently wore as a stole. Usually featured with purple and blue long hair in a swept up hairstyle, long purple dress and long green gloves. =Raisin Cane= Raisin Cane was introduced in the 1985 Star Comics Strawberry Shortcake title. She is Sour Grapes' adolescent niece. Raisin was featured with purple hair, grapes as earrings, a purple dress and shoes along with striped tights. In her first appearance, she was enlisted to infiltrate Strawberryland's annual pie baking contest. By the end of this adventure, Raisin realized that she wanted to be friends with Strawberry Shortcake and her companions, but her loyalties were still with her aunt and the Purple Pieman. Her pet is a worm named Durt. Due to her comic only appearance, she remains a fairly obscure character. Her name is a pun on the phrase \\"raising cane\\". 2003 Throughout the 2003 reintroduction of the Strawberry Shortcake series, a number of recurring characters appear. =Year 1= Strawberry Shortcake Strawberry Shortcake is the protagonist and the title character of the Strawberry Shortcake franchise. She is said to be the \\"unofficial princess\\" of Strawberryland,http://www.huckleberrybriar.com/characters.php Huckleberry Briar: ...and as the unofficial berry princess of Strawberryland, hahahhshe puts her heart and soul into seeing that things improve for everyone she meets... and is often seen wearing a pink hat with strawberries printed on it. In this version, she lives in a large strawberry. She shares her berry bungalow with her younger sister Apple Dumplin', her cat Custard (voiced by Sarah Koslosky, and later Anna Jordan), and her dog Pupcake (voiced by Nils Haaland). Many of Strawberry Shortcake's days are spent in the simple pleasures of tending berry vines. Strawberry also likes to spend time with her friends, so she frequently visits nearby lands. Strawberry is always cheerful and is ready to help her friends at any time. This version of Strawberry Shortcake appears slightly older than her 1980s counterpart, and was voiced by Sarah Heinke from 2003 until the franchise's reboot in 2009. She is also the only character who has been in every single episode, since she's the main character. Apple Dumplin' Apple Dumplin' was the only \\"baby\\" character in this updated continuity of Strawberry Shortcake. Apricot would eventually appear, but was depicted as much older than Apple (though still younger than Strawberry Shortcake and her peers), and Cherry Cuddler would have a PlayMates doll issued, but was never featured as an actual character in a story. This time around, it is revealed that Apple Dumplin' is Strawberry Shortcake's baby sister residing in their berry-shaped cottage, which more or less explains why a young girl is seen taking care of a baby unattended. Apple's hair is strawberry blonde in this version, and she wears a red shirt with an apple- printed dress. Her pet is a duck called Apple Ducklin', but on the 2003 DVD \\"Get Well Adventure\\", she has three ducks. Voiced by Kate Labosky. Ginger Snap Ginger Snap is an all-new character for the 2000s reboot of the franchise. With updated characters Orange Blossom and Angel Cake, Ginger Snap completes the nucleus of Strawberry Shortcake's ever-expanding circle of friends. Ginger Snap is an expert inventor, and purveyor of every known kind of cookie. Her massive gingerbread factory in Cookie Corners combines these two interests neatly. Her pet is the cleverly named Chocolate Chipmunk. She is voiced by Samantha Triba. She appears in every episode except \\"The Mystery of Seaberry Beach, \\"Legend of the Lost Treasure, and Back in the Saddle Orange Blossom In the 2003 incarnation, Orange Blossom manages Orange Blossom Acres, and lives in an orange-shaped tree house high in one of her trees. She retains her status as front and center in Strawberry Shortcake's close circle of friends. She has an orange butterfly named Marmalade. She is voiced by Dejare Barfield Along with Ginger and Angel, she appears in every episode except \\"The Mystery of Seaberry Beach, \\"Legend of the Lost Treasure, and Back in the Saddle but she is mentoned Angel Cake This incarnation of the character of Angel Cake is very different from her original incarnation in the 80s. She even teamed with a different pet, a lamb called Vanilla Icing. The new Angel Cake is blonde and possesses a tremendous talent for cake decoration. However she is also known to be a perfectionist and can become rather ill-tempered if things don't go her way.DiC Entertainment/20th Century Fox, Angel Cake In The Outfield, Play Day Surprise, DVD, 2005 Her neighborhood in Strawberryland is called Cakewalk, and is a frosting-coated layer cake testament to her abilities. She is voiced by Rachel Ware Along with Ginger, and Orange, she appears in every episode except \\"The Mystery of Seaberry Beach, \\"Legend of the Lost Treasure, Toto's Tale, and Where the Gem Berries Grow. Huckleberry Pie In this incarnation, Huckleberry Pie remains the token male of the line, although his character has been updated, and distanced from literary allusion. This very modern Huck wears jeans and a baseball cap, and lives in a fort in a place called Huckleberry Briar. His wild abode features a skate park full of ramps and secret entrances, a testament to him being a skateboarder. He has a pet frog named Shoofly. He was first voiced by James Street and later voiced by Daniel Canfield for a brief period after the former's death in a skateboarding accident. =Year 2= Licorice Whip Licorice Whip is introduced in the 2005 DVD, Adventures on Ice Cream Island. He is a disreputable traveling showman who kidnaps Strawberry Shortcake's filly friend, Honey Pie Pony, to be the star of his Traveling Horsey Hoedown show. He is a tall, slim man dressed in tall black boots, a long black overcoat, and a licorice-ribbed vest. He has reddish-brown hair and wears a tall, black, licorice-ribbed stove-pipe hat. His under-appreciated helper is a black bird known as Raven. In the end, after his captured horses escape, Licorice Whip yells \\"I'll be back!\\" . His return was chronicled in the game Strawberry Shortcake: Ice Cream Island Riding Camp for the Game Boy Advance, in which he was drilling Ice Cream Island for its cookie crust foundation to be sold as frozen snacks. His constant and reckless drilling destabilized the island's foundations, and he ultimately gets himself into trouble. He redeems himself after Strawberry Shortcake rescues him at the end of the game. Voiced by Jerry Longe. Peppermint Fizz First introduced in the episode, Peppermint's Pet Peeve, Peppermint Fizz is a misbehaving \\"brat who needs to be tamed\\" character by which the good nature of Strawberry Shortcake shines in comparison. She instigated many a plot in her tenure, but was always set on the right path in the end. She is much more butchy than the other girls. Later in the series, we found the character working against her own better nature, actively attempting to become a better friend. Her negative traits were toned down after the introduction of Raspberry Torte, later revealed to be her friend. She seems to strongly desire to be Strawberry's friends, and when she is aged up in season 4 she is very excited to be around Strawberry any chance she gets. She has insecurity issues and feels she doesn't fit in in Strawberry land. Her pet is Cola Chameleon. Voiced by Rebecca Noodle. Blueberry Muffin First introduced in the episode, The Blueberry Beast, this incarnation of Blueberry Muffin is a bookworm, moving into Strawberryland a few days prior to the start of the episode. In this version, Blueberry Muffin is depicted with brown hair, but late in this continuity her hair reverted to its regular blue color. Strawberry Shortcake and her friends were afraid of her at first, thinking her some kind of monster that has occupied an abandoned home in the far side of Huckleberry Briar. By the end of said episode, the girls have befriended Blueberry Muffin and helps her move into her new residence. Voiced by Bianca Heyward. Rainbow Sherbet Rainbow Sherbet is a nautical adventurer, captain of The Rainbow Float, her own ornate paddleboat that voyages on the Punch Bowl Pond. Introduced in the episode \\"The Costume Party\\", Rainbow Sherbet is a new girl arriving in the said episode. However, a conflict caused by Peppermint Fizz very nearly caused her to leave Strawberryland. Strawberry Shortcake quickly created an elaborate scheme around a costume party (hence the title of the episode) to resolve the issue and convinced Rainbow Sherbet to stay. She has a pet toucan called Triple Treat. Voiced by Laura Grimm. Coco Calypso Coco Calypso is a carefree tropical girl, who lives in a pineapple-shaped hut on the Seaberry Shore, a locale far removed from the residents of Strawberryland proper. First introduced in the episode, The Mystery of Seaberry Beach, she was depicted as a long-distance pen pal to Strawberry Shortcake. Coco Calypso enlisted Strawberry's help as her seaberry harvests were being stolen. In the end it turned out to be a misunderstanding between her and neighbor Seaberry Delight. Her pet is a parrot called Papaya. Voiced by Melissa Deni. Seaberry Delight A seaberry is a fictional pearl-like berry that grows underwater in the waters off the aptly named Seaberry Shore. Seaberry Delight is an oceanic enthusiast, spending as much time swimming in the ocean as she does on land. She lives in a shell-shaped cottage in a hidden cove, which is only accessible by swimming underwater. When Strawberry Shortcake and her friends first encountered her, they thought that she was a mermaid, but she is really just a girl. She was first introduced in the episode, The Mystery of Seaberry Beach, in which she mistakenly thought that unwitting neighbor Coco Calypso's Seaberry harvests were wild fruit and free to take. The issue was resolved by the end of the episode. In her storyline appearances (and in her BanDai doll release), Seaberry has ordinary blonde hair, but when PlayMates later produced a doll of her, they changed her hair to a distinctive aqua color. Her pet is a sea turtle called Kiwi. Voiced by Abigail Leib. Sea Serpent A yellow lizard and an in-story character introduced for the episode, Legend Of The Lost Treasure, the Sea Serpent is a villain character who enslaves some mermaids and owns 2 red fish. She turns after a close brush with death where she must save herself or her golden sand dollars in an earthquake. Voiced by Pam Carter. =Year 3= Tea Blossom Originally Almond Tea, the character was retconned somewhat for Strawberry's 2006 \\"A World of Friends\\" campaign. Now called Tea Blossom, her home is in the Plum Blossom Province, near The Great Wall of Chocolate, the Strawberry Shortcake version of Great Wall of China but her pet Marza Panda remains the same. Crepes Suzette Although her name (with altered spelling) and even her pet remain the same since her 1980s introduction, Strawberry Shortcake's French friend Crepes Suzette's image has undergone an extreme makeover for the 2000s. She sports long, wavy pink locks, and Eclair is similarly pink. She operates a chic boutique in the heart of Pearis, when she is not visiting Strawberry Shortcake at her home in Strawberryland. Frosty Puff In 2006, the Strawberry Shortcake DVD \\"World of Friends\\" introduced a re-telling of the events of the 1983 \\"Housewarming Surprise\\" TV special, with a few changes to the story as well as the cast. While some of her \\"new\\" friends from around the world stayed nearly the same (Crepes Suzette), and others underwent minor changes (Almond Tea/Tea Blossom), still others (Mint Tulip, Caf√© Ol√©) were replaced altogether by new, original characters. Frosty Puff, a warm-hearted girl from ice cold Niceland, was one of these new foreign friends. Although it is not obvious by her cold-weather appearance and outfitting, Frosty Puff's scent is that of Blackberries, a first in the Strawberry Shortcake toy line. Her pet is a penguin called Freezer Pop. Tangerina Torta Tangerina Torta, another new \\"Around The World\\" Strawberry Shortcake friend for 2006, is a real nature girl. She lives in a treehouse in the Tangerine Bosque, a lush tropical rainforest, presumably in the Strawberry Shortcake version of South America, though no country name has been given. Tangerina has a pet monkey called Banana Bongo. Oddly, a similar monkey (with the same name) was a companion of Coco Calypso on the Seaberry Shore nearly a year prior to the introduction of Tangerina Torta and her Banana Bongo. Raspberry Torte Another of Strawberry Shortcake's earliest friends, Raspberry has undergone more changes than most for her re-introduction in the 2000s. For one thing, her last name was altered to \\"Torte\\", apparently since American Greetings didn't like an unseemly connotation that the word \\"Tart\\" has acquired, though a tart and a torte are markedly different types of desserts. Also, while Raspberry's new pet in the 2000s retains the name \\"Rhubarb\\", it is now a raccoon, instead of a monkey, as in the 1980s. Although the \\"new\\" Raspberry can be brash and thoughtless, she is generally seen as the athletic and fitness fanatic of Strawberryland. Her home was originally announced in the 2003 series to be Raspberry Fields, but was changed to Raspberry Meadows some time before her debut in the Sweet Dreams Movie. Raspberry turned out to be a total tomboy but doesn't mind wearing a dress. Lemon Meringue In this incarnation of the franchise, Lemon Meringue remains the glamorous go-to girl of the group for anyone who might need help with their hair or general beauty tips. She even runs a beauty salon out of her home on Lemon Lane in Strawberryland. This characterization was transplanted nearly verbatim into the 2009 re-re-boot of the line. Her pet, however, in the 2002 edition, was changed to a yellow skunk named Sourball. In this new updated version, Lemon Meringue seems to have an especially close friendship with Raspberry Torte. The Berry Fairies Apparently meant to replace the Berrykins of the 1980s series, the Berry Fairies serve a similar purpose to the Berrykins in the new 2003 series in the sense that they are entrusted with giving the fruits in Strawberryland their unusually large size, their scent and abundant quantities in the new series. The Berry Fairies are ruled by the Berry Fairy Queen, who is in turn advised by an adviser. =Year 4= Characters who change their looks in year 4, along with the rest of new characters introduced in the said period of Strawberry Shortcake series. Starting from year 4, a number of characters change their looks to be more aged than in previous periods. The stories of the episodes also start to revolve around more mature things such as getting jobs, making a band, driving a car, and even becoming a movie star. Apricot In this incarnation of the franchise, Apricot is depicted as being close to the same age as Strawberry Shortcake and her friends. Now apricot-haired Apricot is the new girl in Strawberryland, and feeling insecure, resorted to telling tall tales of wealth and accomplishment in an attempt to win friends. She soon learned her lesson, and was welcomed warmly into Strawberry Shortcake's wide circle of friends. Cherry Cuddler A new updated character design was produced for a 2000s Cherry Cuddler, but she never actually appeared in a storyline. She was introduced direct-to-toy-line by Playmates, however, surprisingly paired with Crepes Suzette as her baby sister (Crepes Suzette in this continuity also has a cherry theme and fragrance). Plum Puddin' Originally introduced as a male when the franchise was first introduced in the 1980s, Plum Puddin' was changed to a girl in 1984. Still a girl when she was reintroduced, she was added to the ever-growing line-up of Strawberry's revival in 2008. While still an intelligent character, she's also a bit of a walking disaster. Banana Candy Formerly Banana Twirl, on joining the ever-expanding cast of the Strawberry Shortcake revival in 2008, she is now known as Banana Candy, her former vigor and energy seem to have translated into workaholism, for she runs the small town of Banana Boro all by herself. As in the 1980s, she seems destined to remain petlessPrototype toys of a line of \\"Baby Pets\\", from a projected (but unproduced) line of Strawberry Shortcake \\"Babies\\" dolls, apparently planned for release in 1986, are known to exist. Included in this line-up are infant versions of Custard, Marmalade, Marsh Mallard, Elderberry, Melonie Belle, Cheesecake, Frappe', and an otherwise unheard-of yellow baby elephant. Since five of these eight pets correspond to the girls featured in 1985 \\"Berrykins\\" Assortment of dolls (Strawberry, Orange Blossom, Mint Tulip, Plum Puddin' and Peach Blush), it appears that the unknown pet may be associated with the sixth Berrykins Doll, Banana Twirl. Banana Candy has long, brown hair and is a mechanic. However, the PlayMates' doll version of the character has bright yellow hair. Watermelon Kiss Strawberry Shortcake's friend Watermelon Kiss is a sunny, summer-loving girl who loves horses and being outdoors. Her name is the same as a simple cocktail drink made with Mountain Dew and Strawberry Schnapps. She is also known for a spectacular plate-spinning act. Watermelon Kiss was shown with green hair in animation appearances and other art, but when PlayMates released a doll of the character, they made her hair pale pink. Annie Oatmeal Annie Oatmeal owns and operates the Berry Prairie Dude Ranch. Her name is apparently a play on famous western sharpshooting celebrity Annie Oakley, while also evidently referencing oatmeal cookies. Seemingly around the same age as the recently (as of 2007) more grown up Strawberry Shortcake, Annie Oatmeal hired Strawberry and her friend Angel Cake to work as hands on her ranch. In her role as Strawberry's employer, however, Annie Oatmeal is depicted as less of a peer, and more of an authority figure, something new and very different in Strawberry Shortcake's previously carefree world. Caramel Corn A surprise new character introduction in the \\"Big Country Fun\\" DVD, Caramel Corn (misspelled \\"Carmel\\" on the DVD packaging) is a hard-working farm girl, whose motif appears to be that of triangle-shaped candy corn. Caramel's land was being coveted by The Purple Pie Man and Sour Grapes, who wanted to build a parking lot for their adjacent \\"Pie Man Land\\" Amusement Park. With the help of Strawberry Shortcake and her friends, a large Country Fair was thrown, all of the animals that had \\"disappeared\\" were returned, and Caramel Corn's farm was saved. Lime Light A very different character from the '80s' Lime Chiffon, Lime Light is a character that was introduced very late in this continuity, in the episodes on the DVD Berrywood Here We Come. Lime Light is initially a selfish, self-centered spoiled child star. She blames Strawberry Shortcake for being jealous and eventually figures out she was being selfish, but was eventually reformed by Strawberry Shortcake by the end of the episode, and, as of then, she starts thinking of others. The Peculiar Purple Pieman In the 2003 series, Porcupine Peak is never seen. The Purple Pieman usually traversed throughout Strawberryland and the surrounding areas in a cart drawn by Dobbin, his horse. He was much the same as he was in his original form, though given further depth and humanness of character. An 'evil conscience' is not mentioned this time around, and the Purple Pieman at last reforms in time for the series finale. The Purple Pieman has a flock of Berry Birds, which he uses to steal berries and eavesdrop on the denizens of Strawberryland. The Berry Birds are nameless in the rerelease. Sour Grapes In the 2006 Sweet Dreams Movie, Sour Grapes was reintroduced as the Purple Pieman's sister. In a number of ways, her personality stayed as it had been before. As in the '80s, she chided the Pieman for his ridiculousness. Unlike her '80s form, however, Sour Grapes had a greater sense of morality this time around. Also changed was her position in the crimes; whereas before she had suggested schemes herself and often talked the Purple Pieman into them, this time she was the follower and it can be argued that she followed out of affectionate familial devotion. Despite her shortcomings witnessed in the episode \\"Queen For a Day\\" and despite her initial reactions to the children in the aforementioned feature movie, she was repeatedly shown to be quite maternal and intelligent. When excited, her personality often changed from that of bitter adult to playful young girl. Though irritable, to emotionally reach her for the better was not at all a hard task. An allergy to strawberries, a suspectibility to headaches and hints to poor physical health in general further added to her depth of character. The 'first' reformation of this character occurred in the episode \\"Dancin' in Disguise\\" and while she remained partners with her brother throughout the series, she did wish for things to be different. In the finale, the Purple Pieman is at last reformed, thus inevitably sealing Sour Grapes' own reformation. Dregs, the pet snake, did make a reappearance in the \\"Queen For a Day\\" episode. Strangely, he did not return after this. =Animals= Pets At the beginning of the series, Strawberry Shortcake is introduced and is paired with Custard the cat and Pupcake the Dog. Indeed, no other pets were introduced up until the episode Best Pets Yet =Custard= A pink cat with darker pink stripes and the leader of the pets, Custard was one of two pets introduced at the start of the franchise itself, and one of the \\"berry\\" few animals in the show's universe that can talk to humans. Indeed, Custard's ability to talk to the other pets and the humans proves invaluable as a translator for Pupcake and Strawberry. Custard is generally snobbish and sarcastic in temperament, but has a heart of gold. It is revealed that at that the beginning of the series, she loved Strawberry more than Pupcake,which they eventually becomes friends. She also hates Christmas. Custard is voiced by Sarah Koslosky in the first four episodes of the show, but the voice cast was changed to Anna Jordan for the rest of the series. =Pupcake= A white dog with blue spots, a blue tail, blue ears and a blue strawberry shaped patch over one eye, Pupcake is a very energetic and easily excitable puppy, although unlike Custard he is unable to talk to humans. Pupcake's design and existence has been the source of controversy among many fans of the series. The episode that tells the story of Pupcake entering Strawberry Shortcake's life, Here Comes Pupcake, contained various inconsistencies that contradict with the first episode, Meet Strawberry Shortcake. Likewise, while many official merchandise features the Strawberry-shaped patch on Pupcake's left eye, there exist other official merchandise that features the patch on Pupcake's right eye instead. Lastly, Pupcake's eye color has been opened to some debate, with most merchandise depicting it as brown while some depict it as blue. Pupcake also appears to be very apt at lip-syncing, as he's been seen doing so in quite a few episodes. He is also assumed to be the narrator of the Berry Brick Road episode Toto's Tale. Pupcake is voiced by Nils Haaland. Pupcake is actually a pet of Strawberry Shortcake. He used to be Huckleberry's pet. =Chocolate Chipmunk= A brown chipmunk that wears a white baker's hat with a gingerbread man cookie on it, and a purple collar with a cookie-shaped tag, Chocolate Chipmunk is bright and as technically apt as his owner, Ginger Snap. While he does not speak human language, apparently the inhabitants of Strawberryland, and especially Ginger Snap, are capable of understanding his chipmunk chatters. =Vanilla Icing= A light-purple lamb with a snow- white fleece who is Angel Cake's pet. =Marmalade Butterfly= An orange colored butterfly, Marmalade is the quietest of pets in Strawberryland, apparently only able to make soft tongue rolling noises. Marmalade is Orange Blossom's pet. =Triple Ripple Toucan= Known under various aliases, including Triple Dip and Triple Treat, although Triple Ripple has been confirmed to be the official name by American Greetings. Rainbow Sherbet's pet has been released direct to toy line and makes an appearance in the Windows/Mac edutainment title Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Best Friends. However, the character made a very late appearance in the show's run, only finally appearing in the episode \\"A Princess Named Rap\\", a few years after it was released to the toy line. =Papaya Parrot= Another one of the few animals in the Strawberry Shortcake universe that could talk, Papaya Parrot only appeared in the episodes \\"The Mystery of Seaberry Shore\\" and \\"The Legend Of The Lost Treasure\\". Sadly, like her owner, Coco Calypso, she was never seen again after. =Kiwi Sea Turtle= Kiwi was never seen on the series. However, he has been produced as toy by Bandai. He is Seaberry Delight's pet. =Cola Chameleon= Able to change color, and also talented at lip- syncing. He is Peppermint Fizz's pet. =Raven= Pet of the villain Licorice Whip. Raven is another one of the few animals in Strawberry Shortcake's universe to be able to talk to humans. He is also one of the first villains to redeem himself. =Other pets= * Shoofly - Huckleberry Pie's frog * Apple Ducklin - Apple Dumplin's duckling * Cheesecake - Blueberry Muffin's mouse * Eclair - Cr√™pe Suzette's pink poodle * Marza Panda - Tea Blossom's panda * Freezer Pop - Frosty Puff's penguin * Sourball - Lemon Meringue's skunk * Rhubarb - Raspberry Torte's racoon * Banana Bongo- Tangerina Torta's monkey * Hopsalot- Apricot 's rabbit * Elderberry- Plum Pudding 's owl * Dreggs - Sour Grapes' snake Fillies Back in the 1980s incarnation of the World of Strawberry Shortcake, the character encountered a couple of horses in her travels, with varying degrees of success. With the advent of the 2003 series, American Greetings introduced a whole range of fillies to the revived franchise. Honey Pie was introduced in the first episode, Meet Strawberry Shortcake,20th Century Fox/DiC Entertainment, Meet Strawberry Shortcake, DVD, 2004 while Cookie Dough, Milkshake and Orange Twist were introduced in Horse of A Different Color.20th Century Fox/DiC Entertainment, Horse of A Different Color, Adventures on Ice Cream Island DVD, 2004 The remaining fillies were direct-to-toy-line, and most never appeared in the TV series beyond an on-screen cameo, although Huckleberry Hash, Blueberry Sundae and Ambrosia subsequently appeared in books.Megan E. Bryant, SI Artists; Strawberry Shortcake's Filly Friends, Grosset & Dunlap, Megan E. Bryant, SI Artists; The Friendship Trip, Grosset & Dunlap, A few of the remaining fillies also made an appearance in the edutainment title Strawberry Shortcake and Her Berry Best Friends for Windows and Mac. As of the TV series' Year 4, and with the transition of the Strawberry Shortcake franchise from Bandai to PlayMates, a number of very different new directions were embarked upon, including a new approach concerning the merchandising of horses for the line. The ensuing toy \\"ponies\\" were a noted departure in that they had no names of their own, and were designated by the name of the character to whom they were linked (\\"Strawberry Shortcake's Pony\\", for instance, who was obviously not Honey Pie Pony). A number of these direct-to-toy-line ponies were given names in the Big Country Fun DVD, and are the first ponies introduced for Year 4 characters.20th Century Fox/DiC Entertainment, Best Ranch Hand, Big Country Fun, DVD, 2008 Honey Pie Pony and her filly contemporaries have been sidelined by this development, and as a result have received reduced screen time in Year 4. =Honey Pie Pony= A talking palomino horse (and the only horse on the series that could talk) who was introduced with the franchise's revival, Honey Pie Pony likes to chat about anything, often leading to meandering monologues on her extensive travels of the world. Honey Pie is prone to exaggerating the truth, however, which makes her surprise at learning of the existence of a whole island of fillies (Ice Cream Island) nearby to Strawberryland a bit more understandable. Honey Pie is also picky about who can ride on her back; Strawberry Shortcake is her rider of choice. Never one to do things the way others do, Honey Pie has a friend/pet bee called Honey Doodle.Mentioned in the remembering book provided with the remembering book interactive Strawberry Shortcake toy manufactured by Ban-dai She is voiced by Hannah Koslosky. =Cookie Dough= Cookie Dough is known as the slowest of the fillies, owing to her inability to refrain from stopping to nibble every sweet thing that crosses her path. She and Ginger Snap get along famously especially because of this, for Ginger Snap is seldom without a cookie to share. A cream-colored filly decorated with tan and brown speckles, Cookie Dough's dark brown mane and tail were augmented later in the toy line with streaks of bright purple. =Milkshake= Milkshake is a very jumpy, timid filly. Her white coat is speckled with bright pink polka dots, and her frothy, super curly mane and tail are also pink. Milkshake's habit of running from her many fears has made her the fastest filly around. But with positive reinforcement and encouragement from her human ally, Angel Cake, Milkshake has made strides towards overcoming her nervous nature. =Orange Twist= Orange Twist's pale orange sherbet-colored coat is marked with bright orange swirl designs. Her bright blonde mane and tail are streaked with orange as well. She is generally a wild filly, jumping and bucking when most people attempt to ride her. Orange Blossom, though, is NOT most people. Orange Blossom's shy nature has a disarming effect on Orange Twist, making her calm and agreeable. =Huckleberry Hash= Huckleberry Hash was introduced seemingly as an afterthought, towards the end of Bandai's run of producing Strawberry Shortcake Toys. A medium blue filly dotted with lighter and darker blue spots, Huckleberry Hash was merchandised as part of the \\"Fantasy Sparkles\\" filly line, and came wearing a pair of large blue fabric fairy wings. =Cherry Vanilla= Cherry Vanilla is paired with Peppermint Fizz, and was marketed in the line of Bandai's Strawberryland Fillies. A deep pink filly with red speckles and a vivid red mane and tail, Cherry Vanilla is said to be the sweetest natured of the Ice Cream Island fillies, as she attempts to compensate for the often \\"bratty\\" nature of her human counterpart. =Spumoni= A curiously coated filly, colored in large swirled swatches of pink, green and brown, like the multi-colored ice cream for which she is named, Spumoni has a lush dark brown mane and tail, which perfectly matches Coco Calypso's hair. Like most of the Ice Cream Island fillies, who received nothing in the way of storyline or development from the animated shows, the only information on Spumoni's character comes from the packaging of her toy, which states that she likes to have her mane braided. =Blueberry Sundae= Blueberry Sundae was planned to be introduced as part of Bandai's \\"Filly Parade\\" line of toy horses, but was not actually released as a toy until the final wave of \\"Fantasy Sparkle\\" fillies. A filly dappled in bright shades of blue with white legs and mane and tail, Blueberry Sundae is said to be very vain about her striking appearance, and will stop in her tracks to admire her reflection whenever she encounters it. Blueberry Sundae made a short appearance on the episode \\"Horse of a Different Color\\", over 4 episodes before her owner, Blueberry Muffin, was introduced. =Pistachio= Pistachio is teamed with Seaberry Delight, and loves to splash in the ocean waves just as much as her human friend. Her coat, mane and tail are all creamy shades of green, though for some reason, the head of Bandai's toy Pistachio is a much darker green than the rest of her. =Butter Pecan= Butter Pecan is an adventurous filly who likes being groomed and who loves to travel. Her coat is a warm tan, dotted with brown specks and streaked with unusual brown zebra-like stripes. Her mane and tail are bright yellow. Her human companion is Rainbow Sherbet, with whom she shares NO aspects of color coordination. =Lemon Ice= Lemon Ice and Raspberry Ripple (below) share something in common with Cherry Vanilla, in that they were marketed without benefit of having a kid character counterpart to ride them. Dolls of said counterparts Lemon Meringue and Raspberry Torte were said to be in the works as the final wave of Bandai's \\"Fantasy Sparkle\\" fillies were released (in a limited market), but the Strawberry Shortcake license passed from Bandai to PlayMates before this could come to pass. PlayMate's initial Strawberry Shortcake \\"Flavor Swirl\\" Wave included dolls of both Lemon Meringue and Raspberry Torte, but their filly friends from Bandai were long gone by then. Lemon Meringue has since been aligned with a new PlayMates pony named Daffodil. =Raspberry Ripple= Raspberry Ripple is a dazzling fuchsia pink color, swirled through with \\"ripples\\" of bright white on her face, legs and hindquarters. Like Lemon Ice (above), her toy was released in very limited quantities, in Bandai's final \\"Fantasy Sparkles\\" wave of fillies. =Ambrosia= Ambrosia is perhaps the most obscure horse in a list of many fairly obscure horses. Never featured on Strawberry Shortcake's animated TV show, nor ever produced as a toy, Ambrosia is a magical unicorn depicted in the book \\"Berry Princess\\".Megan E. Bryant, MJ Illustrations; Berry Princess, Grosset & Dunlap, In the book, Strawberry and friends are told by a magic mirror that Ambrosia is lost in a maze in the forest and can only be rescued by the Berry Princess. Strawberry Shortcake successfully rescues Ambrosia, implying that she is indeed the Berry Princess. =Buttercup= The Berry Prairie Dude Ranch was stocked to overflowing, with enough ponies to accommodate two teams of four \\"dude\\" visitors, as well as hired hands Strawberry Shortcake and Angel Cake and ranch owner Annie Oatmeal. Of nearly a dozen ponies on hand, a mere few had their names mentioned. Surprisingly, the bright pink pony rode by Strawberry Shortcake was not named, but \\"Ol' Buttercup\\", who was paired with Blueberry Muffin on Strawberry Shortcake's team, was. =Sunflower= Apricot was assigned to Sunflower, a pretty peach-colored pony during her stay at The Berry Prairie Dude Ranch. Sunflower was billed simply as \\"Apricot's Pony\\" when she was released as part of the \\"Sugar Sweet Ponies\\" line of PlayMates toys, the same wave that included horses for Strawberry Shortcake, Angel Cake, and Crepes' Suzette, the last of whom was not included in the \\"Big Country Fun\\" animated DVD adventures. =Daffodil= One of merely two PlayMates-era ponies to have both a toy AND a name, Daffodil is a sunny yellow. Dubbed \\"Lemon Meringue's Pony\\" by PlayMates, Daffodil was released as part of the \\"Big Country Fun\\"-aligned \\"Picnic Pie Ponies\\" wave. =Thunder= While the other ponies introduced in the \\"Big Country Fun\\" DVD were named after various flowers, the pony that Annie Oatmeal matched with perennial newcomer Plum Puddin' was called Thunder. A deep purple pony with a cropped lavendar mane and tail, Thunder was referred to both as a he AND a she during the course of the adventure, not unlike Plum Puddin' during the course of the character's history. 2009/2010 In late 2008, American Greetings relaunched the series with redesigned characters and changed personalities. The toy line merchandising this new incarnation is produced by Hasbro, the fifth company to sell Strawberry Shortcake Dolls (in the American market) since her beginning. Hasbro is also the current owner of Kenner, making this new line a homecoming of sorts for the Strawberry Shortcake license. =Strawberry Shortcake= Strawberry Shortcake is very patient, cheerful, optimistic, a great leader, and the berry best friend ever. Strawberry runs Berry Bitty Caf√©, where she bakes and sells delicious food and prepares amazing smoothies, such as Berry Bitty World's first rainbow smoothie. She also opened a marketplace for Berrykin Bloom to sell his bumper crops of bitty fruits and vegetables. Strawberry doesn't always know exactly what she should do in difficult situations, but in the end, her good heart always helps her make the best decisions. Strawberry was named the Berry Fest Princess in honor during Princess Berrykin's absence for her ability to carry out capable decisions and by a popular vote. She loves to sing and play her guitar. Strawberry is a good writer too, and enjoys writing stories, poetry, and songs. After Cherry Jam's arrival, the girls started a band called \\"Strawberry and the Sweet Beats\\", with Strawberry as the lead (Cherry had enough of the limelight). After Strawberry built the marketplace, she moved from above the Caf√© to above the Marketplace, where she has her own dream bedroom. However, when guests arrive, such as Huckleberry, Strawberry allows them to stay there. Strawberry loves animals and is often able to see things from their point of view. She has her pink and white polka dot kitten named Custard, and her green and white puppy named Pupcake (both voiced by Andrea Libman). Strawberry is almost always seen wearing her Newsboy cap with green and white tights. She is voiced by Anna Cummer, and her singing voice is by Tracey Moore. =Orange Blossom= Orange owns her own General Store, where everyone can get everything they need. Though her store has so much inventory, Orange doesn't really like anyone helping her with her work (which frequently consists of stacking cans). In the back of Orange's store is the post office, where postmaster Bumble Bee, Jadebug, and other postal carriers work. Orange can play the violin. Orange also was the mastermind behind the city's own resort Berry Bitty Bay Resort. She is very well organized, a fantastic planner and creative; for example, she invented the very popular game of Dandyball. Orange is also brave, but can get very homesick if she ever has to leave home. Orange temporarily took care of a frog (that she first thought was a fish) named Tad, until she discovered wild animals are happiest in the wild. Orange really likes hopping on her pogo stick and even broke the Berry Bitty world record for most consecutive hops, which was verified by judge Bosley Bookworm (sometimes a co-judge alongside his cousin Boris). Orange's everyday outfit almost always includes her favorite orange boots. She also wears a flower clip in her hair. In a book release \\"A New Look\\", Orange gets eyeglasses, but the television program has not shown this yet. As of season 3, Orange adopts an orange dachshund puppy she names Marmalade (possibly a reference to her previous pet butterfly of the same name). She is voiced by Janyse Jaud. =Lemon Meringue= Lemon owns and runs Berry Bitty City's salon, aptly named Lemon's Salon. Lemon is very creative and artistic. She came up with an all new \\"salon beautification\\" called a \\"Glamicure\\", where she can make clients nails sparkly and play music. Lemon also owns a tour boat. She is an excellent gardener and even beat out Berry Bitty City's top gardener, Berrykin Bloom, to win first place in the flower contest with her pretty violets (though she sacrificed them to save the festival). Lemon also likes to paint, especially with watercolor, and loves to make scented sprays (like room sprays, perfume, and hair sprays). Lemon has a tendency to jump to conclusions, which have been known to hurt people's feelings; she is also easily frightened and often needs extra coaxing to participate. She is also the one who saves the girls' 'bad hair days' with her creative skill with scissors, yet on occasion, has asked for help before, particularity from Strawberry, for hair tips, as Lemon doesn't handle pressure well. She wears a lemon-colored hairclip and green ribbons in her very long locks. As of season 3, Lemon adopts a yellow American cocker spaniel puppy she names Henna. She is voiced by Andrea Libman. =Blueberry Muffin= Blueberry Muffin runs Berry Bitty City's Bookstore called Blueberry's Bookstore (formerly called Blueberry books). She wears a blueberry-colored headband. Blueberry is obsessed with the Patty Persimmon mystery novel series. She has a broad range of knowledge, as she knows something about everything, but, though she is indeed very intelligent, she is not always as smart at times, as she is sometimes forgetful. She is also great at research but really has a hard time accepting things in print might be inaccurate; however, with Strawberry's help, she is learning how to improvise. Blueberry has an excellent vocabulary and is frequently correcting the other girls' grammar. Bosley Bookworm (voiced by Paul Dobson) helps Blueberry run the bookstore. Huckleberry Pie's arrival has given Blueberry the opportunity to have someone share her interests, and thus, they become best friends. As of season 3, Blueberry owns a pastel blue husky puppy she names Scouty. She is voiced by Britt McKillip. =Raspberry Torte= Raspberry runs the Fresh Fashions Boutique, a garment fashion store in which she designs, makes, and sells all the merchandise. She is an extremely talented fashion designer and seamstress; she can whip up the fanciest dress anyone could want in a day. Raspberry speaks in an unusual kind of hesitation of wording (a type of stutter, called a block). She was discovered and had a very promising career as a top fashion designer in Berry Big City, but she realized she was happier with her friends and that fame and fortune was not all it was broke up to be. Raspberry was given the nickname \\"Rawr-Rawr-Raspberry\\" by Mavis Marashino. Raspberry can play the keyboard beautifully and is an excellent performer in music. Raspberry sometimes can get competitive when it comes to design with Lemon Meringue as they are both very artistic and share the same flavor for style. She wears a raspberry-colored headband. As of season 3, Raspberry adopts a pink chihuahua puppy she names Chiffon. She is voiced by Ingrid Nilson. =Plum Pudding= Plum Pudding owns and runs Berry Bitty City's dance studio, the Sweet Beats Studio (also called the Sweet Steps Studio). She is a wonderful dancer and a great dance teacher; she excels at teaching a variety of dances, most notably ballet. Thanks to her love for dance, she also has a way of dancing all the way. She was at first not very good at playing the drums, and because of this, was very reluctant to perform one time, but learned to play well with Cherry Jam's help. Plum can be extremely bossy, self-centered, and occasionally rebellious, but, like all the girls, she has a heart of gold. Plum is very competitive and is frequently seeking fame and glory. She often has a hard time dealing with imperfection, both in herself and in others. Plum also has an unusual sense of humor that no one else seems to find funny. She often wears her hair in a ponytail with a plum-colored hairclip and wears leg warmers. As of season 3, Plum adopts a purple and white terrier puppy she names Pitterpatch. She is voiced by Ashleigh Ball. =Cherry Jam= A redesign of Cherry Cuddler, Cherry Jam was first introduced in the episode Starlight, Star Bright. She is big superstar in the Berry Bitty World! Cherry is an excellent performer, songwriter, singer, dancer, and actress, like her neighbors, Wayne and Wanda. Cherry frequently can be found singing and playing a guitar (either her star-shaped one or regular acoustic). She is very nice and quickly becomes Strawberry's best friend. Out of all the girls, Cherry seems most like Strawberry in her maturity and being level headed. Cherry became the resident music teacher in Berry Bitty City and excels at playing every instrument. She also teaches her lessons in Plum's dance studio. She can hunger on healthy foods that contains fruits and vegetables. Cherry's favorite flowers are buttercups. Cherry has very dark purple hair with sparkling highlights. She often wears a pink dress with pink and purple leggings. Cherry is the newest resident of Berry Bitty City. Cherry is frequently pursued by celebrity reporter, Mavis Maraschino. It is unknown exactly where Cherry lives, as for a while, she seemed to stay in her tour bus, but then give it to Mavis to help her travel back to her hometown of Big Berry City. As of season 3, Cherry adopts a pastel pink dalmatian puppy she names Cinnapup. She is voiced by Shannon Chan-Kent; Victoria Duffield provides her singing voice. =Huckleberry Pie= Introduced in the premiere episode of season 3, Huckleberry is a dog lover who is trying (unsuccessfully) to start a pet rescue organization in Berry Big City. Which is where he currently lives, though he visits Berry Bitty City often. Huck is a terrible driver and is always getting his van stuck, is getting lost, or both! Huck pretends to like everything in a desperate attempt to fit in. But he truly shares Blueberry's love of Patty Persimmon mysteries, and has joined with Blueberry to write their own mystery story called \\"Kayleigh and Kyle\\" for \\"Berry Bitty Mysteries\\" magazine. Huck is a terrible dancer, but is always willing to try just about anything the girls can dream up. He has light brown hair, wears a dark blue T-shirt with a picture of huckleberries on it over a green and white striped long-sleeved shirt, light brown pants, and dark blue shoes. He keeps one brown hound puppy named TomTom (a nod to Tom Sawyer). Voiced by Aidan Drummond. =Sweet Grapes= Sweet Grapes is the twin of Sour Grapes. Everyone calls her Sweet for short. She has fair skin, violet eyes that are lighter in color at the bottom, and long violet hair in loose curls. Her hair is darker at the top and gets gradually lighter; the bottom is kind of a rosy lavender. She wears a bright medium blue tank top under a sparkly medium purple and white striped short-sleeve shirt, a frilly bright blue and lavender skirt, lavender and white striped tights, blue and lavender shoes with purple grapes on them, a hair clip with a bunch of purple grapes on top of a lavender bow on top of a bright blue bow, and large black-framed glasses. Sometimes she wears other outfits and hair styles, depending on the activity she is doing. She has a gentle and quiet personality. She has a love of cooking and runs a food truck with Sour. She first appeared in Season 4.http://kidscreen.com/2015/05/13/strawberry-shortcake-cooks-up-fourth-season/ Voiced by Andrea Libman. =Sour Grapes= Sour Grapes is the twin of Sweet Grapes. Everyone calls her Sour for short. She has fair skin, neck length hair that is streaked dark purple and lime green, and purple eyes that turn lime green at the bottom. She has lime green eye shadow and a small beauty mark on her left cheek. She wears a purple and green striped dress, black and white striped tights, and black boots with a bit of green. She also has a black beaded necklace, a black necklace with bunch of green grapes on it, and a black headband with a handful of green grapes on it. Sometimes she wears other outfits and hair styles, depending on the activity she is doing. She has a bored attitude, and can be a bit cranky and rude at times. Like her sister, she has a passion for cooking. She and Sweet run a food truck. She hates her sister's cooking and they don't get along well. She is the first character to wear makeup. She first appeared in Season 4. Voiced by Diana Kaarina. =Apple Dumplin'= Apple Dumpling is Strawberry Shortcake's younger cousin, whereas in the previous continuity, the two were sisters. She is a self-proclaimed adventure blogger and world explorer. She has long strawberry blonde hair (similar to the color of apple juice), fair skin, freckles, and baby blue eyes. She wears a white shirt, yellow vest, light green belt with a red apple, red/orange/yellow plaid skirt, yellow-green and white striped capri pants, red boots with a yellow apple on the side, and a red apple beanie hat. She has a small braid with an apple hairclip at the end of it. Sometimes she wears other outfits and hair styles, depending on the activity she is doing. Her pet is Teatime Turtle. She first appeared in Season 4. Voiced by Rebecca Shoichet. =The Berrykins= The Berrykins are very peaceful characters, who resemble Strawberries, due to the word Berry in their name. They come in all sorts of color combinations and are led by Princess Berrykin, a smart and gracious leader. Many of the Berrykins work at the \\"Berry Works\\" others harvest berries in Berry Bitty Grove, where they harvest glimmerberries that can be converted into juice, which serves as the source of power in Berry Bitty City. Berrykins have magical powers that allow them to easily move things such as berries (because they are bitty themselves). They can also change the colors of the berries with their power. One Berrykin, \\"Baby Berrykin\\", can change the colors of everything; not just berries. Berrykin Bloom is the gardening elder of the Berrykin group. He invented a way of \\"bitty-izing\\" plants, so the Berrykins and the girls can have fruit in the same scale as humans and normal size fruit. This invention inspired Strawberry to open her \\"Marketplace\\". There are Berrykins who are mechanics (Berrykin Bruce and others), and builders (Berrykin Bill and others). Berrykins are avid music fans and wonderful dancers. Berrykin Bloom and Princess Berrykin both play the bassoon. Each Berrykin is voiced by the following - Andrea Libman (Princess Berrykin and Baby Berrykins), Scott McNeil (Berrykin Ed), Sam Vincent (Berrykins Earl and Bruce), Grace Kaufman (Berrykin Bonnie and Baby Berrykins), Janyse Jaud (Baby Berrykins), Paul Dobson (Berrykin Bloom), Kathleen Barr (Queen of Berryvania and Berrykin Becky). =Mr. Longface= On the 2009 version of the show, Mr. Longface Caterpillar is apparently new to Berry Bitty City. Where other characters were implied to be long time residents, Mr. Longface is not familiar with local traditions such as First Frost. He tries to act as an authority figure, but Princess Berrykin and Strawberry are the true leaders. He is a master story teller, like Lyria, but he has been known to mix fact with fiction; sometimes knowingly and sometimes not. He and another male character, Berrykin Bloom, are known to let their imaginations run wild. These two in particular, seem to feed off one another and are frequently frightened for no real reason. Mr Longface owns a mini golf course, and a croquet club. He plays the flute and loves poetry. He often helps watch Strawberry's cafe, but is a terrible cook. His favorite food is violets, and he doesn't care for apple sauce. He wears a blue vest, a navy blue top hat, and a bow tie. He always seems to carrying \\"his book\\". Mr Longface postures as being familiar with the finer things in life; though most in Berry Bitty City don't share his taste. Paul Dobson plays his voice. =The Ladybug Twins= The ladybug twins, Sadiebug Ladybird BerryBeetle and Kadiebug BerryBeetle, are two spoiled and rude relatives of Jadybug (voiced by Nicole Oliver); one of Berry Bitty City's postal workers, they came to visit Jadybug one day and ended up staying, likely because Berry Bitty City was the only place they were not kicked out of. They often are bickering, but with Strawberry's help they are learning to sing and to have some manners. They both seem to have insatiable appetites, as they are always hungry and fighting over food. They attempted to start a \\"Good Citizens Club\\", but only did so because no one allowed them to be in any club before. They had blue eyes and eyelashes. They both wear blue and pink. They both wear headbands, bracelets and boots. They first appeared in the 2010 episode of \\"Strawberry Shortcake\\": Strawberry's House Pests.\\" They also appeared in the episode, \\"Good Citizens Club.\\" =Mavis Maraschino= A ladybug journalist.

It was founded in 1997 in Nyack, New York, United States, by Kenn Rowell, frontman for the NYC-based band, The Baghdaddios. History =Origin= In 1996, Rowell collected blankets from friends to dispense amongst New York City's homeless on Christmas Eve. From then on, he decided to make the drive an annual occurrence, but his friends told him that they had no more blankets to donate, as Rowell had taken them all the previous year. Rowell therefore decided to hold a benefit concert where attendees could contribute one blanket of any condition instead of a cover charge for admission to the show, which would then be delivered to the city's homeless by Rowell and volunteers on Christmas Eve. The first Blank-Fest was held at a club in Nyack called Mai Place, and collected 40 blankets. The next year saw 70 blankets donated at the same club, since renamed The Loft. After that local entrepreneur Chuck Debruyn convinced Rowell to move the show to Bruxelles, a bar-restaurant that he had recently bought into, as it had more room for parking, and a guaranteed walk-in crowd. The show has been held at Bruxelles ever since. =Growth= Since its inception, Rowell estimates that Blank-Fest has collected over 10,000 blankets for the homeless, with the number increasing every year except 2001. The event has steadily increased in exposure through local radio, the internet and the press, including featured articles in the New York Daily News and mentions in the New York Post.\\"Shearer Pleasure\\" ‚Äì New York Post Satellite shows have been formed in other states, cities and countries. Donations have increased to such an extent that volunteers have had to extend distribution of blankets over multiple nights, starting on Christmas Eve. Excess donations are also distributed to homeless shelters. Concerts MCed by Rowell's band, The Baghdaddios, the first Blank-Fest featured a handful of local, Hudson Valley area-based groups, including Joe D'Urso & Stone Caravan, The Wheel, and Chuck Debruyn, who performed as a solo artist. The festival has primarily featured local independent music acts, but has also attracted songwriters and bands with ties to major labels, including EMI artist Patti Rothberg, pedal steel guitar great Buddy Cage, former Misfits guitarist and founder of The Undead, Bobby Steele, Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo, Sirius Radio personality Meg Griffin, international jazz composer Mike McGinnis, and the founder of the Anti-folk movement, Lach. =Satellite shows= In 2006, New Jersey-based independent artist and activist Richard Kubicz read about Blank-Fest in the Daily News and proposed a \\"sister show\\" at a club in Garwood, New Jersey. The first Blank-Fest-NJ, promoted through Kubicz's D.I.Y. music website Let's Rock America, collected 200 blankets, which were donated to a homeless shelter in Cranford and received coverage in the Bergen County press in 2006. Blank-Fest UK was founded in Nottingham, England, after a local recording studio owner heard an interview with The Baghdaddios on the British Armed Forces Radio Network, BFBS Radio One, during the group's tour of England in Summer 2007. After hearing about both the American and UK editions, Ontario-based photographer Gaynor Fletcher approached Rowell about a Blank-Fest Canada show. Debuting in 2007 in Guelph, Ontario, the inaugural Canadian event featured Canadian folk artist James Gordon and received coverage from the Canadian media,\\"Keeping the homeless covered\\" ‚Äì The Guelph Mercury raising over 100 blankets. In addition to these shows former Baghdaddios bassist, John Sidoti, worked with local internet radio personality Ron Purtee to organise the first Blank-Fest Wisconsin,\\"Blank-Fest will help warm-up local homeless\\" ‚Äì The Milwaukee Journal Times also in 2007, in the Milwaukee-area suburb of Racine. There are now eight Blank-Fest shows in seven metropolitan areas in three countries; 2008 saw the addition of three additional shows: Blank-Fest Florida, Lake City, near Gainesville in Northern Florida, and Blank-Fest VA, in Richmond, VA. Promoters in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Calgary and Ottawa in Canada began working on additional Blank-Fest shows in December 2009. The first Blank-Fest Quebec, also the first Blank-Fest show to take place after Christmas, was held on February 21, 2009, collecting 503 blankets.\\"Bands warm up Montreal's streets with BlankFest\\" ‚Äì The Montreal Gazette References External links *Blank-Fest ‚Äì Official website *Blank-Fest UK *Blank-Fest Canada Category:Benefit concerts in the United States ","title":"Blank-Fest"},{"id":"18204080","text":"B28, B 28 or B-28 may refer to: * B28 expressway (Croatia), a road in central Croatia * B-28 Dragon, a prototype for proposed World War II medium bomber * B-28 (grape), another name for the Swiss wine grape Garanoir * B28 nuclear bomb * Bundesstra√üe 28, a German road * Band 28 (700 MHz), a band used by public mobile phone operators ","title":"B28"},{"id":"18204126","text":"Dragonite International Limited, formerly known as Ruyan Group (Holdings) LimitedRuyan Group (Holdings) Limited (Simplified Chinese:Â¶ÇÁÉüÈõÜÂõ¢ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏; Traditional Chinese: Â¶ÇÁÖôÈõÜÂúòÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏; Pinyin: r√∫yƒÅn J√≠tu√°n Y«íuxi√†n G≈çngsƒ´), and initially, Golden Dragon Group (Holdings),Change of Company Name and Capital Reorganization PR Newswire, August 6, 2010 is a health care and pharmaceutical company. In 2013, Imperial Tobacco purchased Dragonite's electronic cigarette division. History Mr. Hon Lik (now Ruyan America's Chairman) patented a design (using high-frequency electronics) and is the original inventor of the first e-cigarettes sold (2003) and Ruyan has registered patents in more than 40 countries since 2003.Ruyan Asserts Patent Rights in China Court Ruling Ruyan began to form the idea for the electronic cigarette in 2000. In 2003, SBT was established, and the first patent was registered in the same year in China. In 2007, Ruyan's first international patent was registered.Electronic Atomizer Cigarette European patent The patent was later granted in the United States as well.US Patent and Trademark Office - Patent for Electronic Cigarette In May 2004, Ruyan's cigar-series was launched and sold in the People's Republic of China market. In October of the same year, the e-pipe series of Ruyan was launched. As for electronic cigarette products, the \\"V8\\" Model, which more closely resembles the appearance of traditional cigarettes, was the key product for 2007. At the end of 2007, Ruyan launched a new one- time use cigar product (named \\"RUYAN e-Gar\\" in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia/Pacific and RUYAN Vegas in the Americas). In June 2007, the Group - currently known as \\"SBT Investment (Holdings) Limited\\"- acquired the entire share structure of Best Partners Worldwide Limited ‚Äì the former entity that was established for the manufacturing and sales of electronic atomizing cigarettes. The Group takes an active position in developing the domestic and overseas markets under the brand name of \\"Ruyan\\" (Simplified Chinese: Â¶ÇÁÉü; Traditional Chinese: Â¶ÇÁÖô; Pinyin: r√∫yƒÅn). In 2013, Imperial Tobacco acquired the intellectual property owned by Hon Lik through Dragonite for $US 75 million. It is important to point out, that almost all e-cigarettes sold now (2013) use a simpler battery powered heating element that heats a liquid to vapour, as opposed to the piezoelectric/ high-frequency/ultrasonic technology patented by Ruyan. The marketing term \\"e\\" denoting \\"electronic\\" refers mainly to the circuitry that controls the current and has been accepted by the industry as a general term for vapour type cigarettes. The first battery operated \\"electric\\" cigarette patent registered in the United States was by Herbert A. Gilbert (Beaver Falls, PA, USA) on 17 August 1965. Product development =Ruyan Ruyan V8 (electronic cigarette)= Ruyan electronic cigarette(e-cigarette)/Ruyan V8RUYAN official international website The Ruyan V8 is an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) invention and production of Ruyan Group (Holdings) Limited. It was first manufactured and launched in the Chinese market in 2006. The Ruyan V8 atomizes a solution-mixture that may or may not contain nicotine; it produces a vapor. It is free of the 4,000 chemicals commonly produced by a lit, ordinary cigarette, including highly dangerous tar and carbon monoxide. The Ruyan V8 comes in 5 different colors: Red, Blue, White, Brown, Black; replaceable cartridges come in several flavors, including: Black Tea, Fruit, Virginia, Menthol Tea, Jasmine and others. The Ruyan V8 is offered in a set containing one e-cigarette (with battery), one spare battery, a charger and cord, one cartridge and an instruction manual. =Ruyan E-pipe (electronic pipe)= The Ruyan electronic pipe(e-pipe)_rosewoodRUYAN official international website) The Ruyan e-pipe was first manufactured and launched in the Chinese market in 2004. It is a non-flammable atomizing electronic pipe that performs the same functions and features as an ordinary pipe. Currently, there are two types of Ruyan e-pipe devices - one is Rosewood and the other is agate.RUYAN official international website Like the Ruyan e-cigarette, the Ruyan e-pipe comes with two rechargeable lithium ion batteries and replaceable nicotine cartridges in 32 mg, 20 mg and 0 mg strengths.RUYAN official international website Cartridges deliver the same amount of vapor equivalent to the \\"puffs\\" provided by two packages of cigarettes for the average traditional smoker. =Ruyan E-cigar (electronic cigar)= Ruyan electronic cigar (first generation) The first generation of Ruyan Electronic Cigars was first manufactured and launched in the Chinese market in 2004. The device itself comes in several designs. Cartridge flavors include Original, Fruit, and Menthol. RUYAN Vegas and RUYAN e-Gar represent the second generation in Ruyan electronic cigars. They were first manufactured and launched in the Chinese market in late 2007 where the new product is referred to as RUYAN No. 1. In the Americas, however, the product is called RUYAN Vegas, and in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia/Pacific, the product is branded RUYAN e-Gar. This new line of products has its own unique features. The new products look more like traditional cigars. They are five and one-half inches in length with a circumference of approximately a size 50 ring. Like other Ruyan e-cigarette products, RUYAN Vegas and RUYAN e-Gar produce no tar and no second-hand smoke and can be used anytime, anyplace. RUYAN Vegas and RUYAN e-Gar are disposable products that deliver more than 1800 puffs of vapor - roughly equivalent to the number of puffs commonly consumed with a full carton of cigarettes.RUYAN official international website The products come fully charged, with a 16 mg nicotine cartridge pre-installed. They may also be easily stored and may be carried upright, mouthpiece up, in a pocket or briefcase. RUYAN Vegas was awarded the honor as most marketable new product at the 2008 Tobacco Plus Expo held in Las Vegas from April 23 to 25th, 2008. Legal disputes In February 2009, Ruyan released a press release saying that they had asserted patent rights to the e-cigarette in a key Chinese court ruling and that a rival manufacturer, Cixi E-cig, had been ordered to destroy its entire inventory and cease trading. Cixi E-cig responded that they had not been ordered to destroy their entire inventory or cease trading. A Chinese court had ruled that two of their products did infringe on Ruyan's intellectual property (both products contained piezoelectric technology) and they were required to stop producing only those. In June 2012, Ruyan filed patent infringement lawsuits against six U.S. electronic cigarette manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

Wells is best remembered for the nearly four decades he spent as a political kingmaker from his base in Cameron County, Texas and as the namesake of Jim Wells County in the same state. Biography =Early years= James B. Wells Jr. was born July 12, 1850 on St. Joseph Island in Texas, a barrier island on the state's Gulf Coast. He was the son of Lydia Hastings and James B. Wells Sr., both of whom hailed from New England sailing families.Evan Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1982; pg. 5. The elder James Wells participated in the Texas Revolution of 1835-36 as a privateer, settling on St. Joseph Island after the end of the conflict to raise cattle and operate a merchant ship. As a boy James Wells Jr. lived in comparative isolation on St. Joseph Island, where he received most of his education directly from his mother. As he grew older he began working at the family's ranch, eventually managing the operation. In 1873 Wells moved to Galveston, where he began to study law under the tutelage of a prominent attorney in that city. He enrolled in the University of Virginia School of Law in 1874 and received his degree the following year.Evan Anders, \\"James Babbage Wells, Jr.,\\" The Handbook of Texas, Texas State Historical Society online, www.tshaonline.org/ =Business career= Following his graduation from the University of Virginia Law School, Wells returned to his native Texas to open up a legal practice in the Gulf Coast city of Rockport, Texas. He soon moved his practice to Corpus Christi, however, where he gained the attention of Democratic Party political boss Stephen Powers. Powers would take Wells under his wing in 1878 following the death of Powers' junior partner in a duel. Wells proved to be a very successful local attorney, winning 20 victories in 21 cases during one session of the Cameron County District Court.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pg. 6. Wells came to be regarded as Powers' proteg√©, even marrying Powers' niece, Pauline Kleiber on November 4, 1880. Together the couple had a daughter and three sons, with the oldest boy dying in a shooting accident in 1899. In addition to the practice of law, Wells was active as a ranch owner, land speculator, and investor in oil exploration and life insurance.Anders, Boss Rule in Texas, pg. 23. He was unable to amass a fortune, however, being driven to speculative investments which sometimes failed magnificently, bringing him to the brink of bankruptcy on three separate occasions.Anders, Boss Rule in Texas, pg. 24. Although commonly known as \\"Judge,\\" Wells was the holder of public office only briefly ‚Äî as elected City Attorney of Brownsville in the early 1880s and as a gubernatorial appointee in 1897 to finish the term of an elected state district judge who had been forced to resign.\\"Biographical Note,\\" \\"A Guide to the James B. Wells Papers, 1837-1926,\\" Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, University of Texas at Austin. =Political career= Powers was instrumental in building up an organized Democratic power base in Cameron County, which was dominated during the Reconstruction Era by Republican political appointees of the federal government in Washington, DC. This took the form of the Blue Club of Cameron County, which gathered together the powerful ranchers of the region to organize voting for unified Democratic tickets. When Powers died in 1882, leadership of the Cameron County Democratic organization fell to Wells, who would remain at the helm of the soon-to-be- dominant political party's patronage machine for the better part of four decades.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pp. 4, 22. By 1890 approximately 97% of the land in Cameron County was controlled by a group of 90 ranchers, who each owned between 1,000 and more than 300,000 acres of tillable soil and rangeland. Each of these controlled the political opinions and votes of a substantial number of their employees, predominately Mexican-Americans who retained the traditional deferential political attitudes of the patr√≥n-pe√≥n relationship.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pp. 6-7. This provided a durable electoral base for Wells and his political allies and enabled them to advance their political agenda of entrenching land ownership rights, maintaining low property taxes, and garnering the intervention of Texas Rangers and federal troops to suppress cattle rustling and civil unrest.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pp. 7-9. He was also a strong supporter of railroad construction in the region, including a bold 1889 project to connect Corpus Christi and Brownsville with the nations of Central America by rail.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pg. 11. From 1895 conservative Democrats firmly dominated Texas politics and Wells forged close ties with the political establishment in Austin as well as local political machines in neighboring counties.Anders, Boss Rule in Texas, pg. 9. This included particularly his cohort Archie Parr of Duval County, with whom he consulted in patronage decisions from the 1890s.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pg. 21. Wells held consistently conservative views, including support of the gold standard, and was a political opponent of reform Democratic Governor \\"Big Jim\\" Hogg, father of the Texas Railroad Commission.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pp. 21-22. Wells' recommendations controlled the appointments of Rangers serving in South Texas and his efforts at organizing South Texas legislators for the purpose were important in maintaining a permanent Ranger presence in Brownsville. Wells and his associates turned a blind eye to the abuses of this force, which together with local vigilante groups conducted what one historian has called a \\"reign of terror\\" which killed at least 200 Mexicans during the bandit raids associated with the revolutionary crisis of 1915.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pg. 10. Wells remained the dominant figure in Cameron County politics, controlling the government agenda and government patronage, through the coming of World War I.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pg. 19. He would remain as chairman of the Cameron County Democratic Party until 1920.Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pg. 20. =Death and legacy= James B. Wells Jr. died December 21, 1923 in Brownsville, Texas. In the estimation of historian Evan Anders, despite modest corruption in Cameron CountyAnders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pp. 8-9. financial gain was only a secondary motive behind Wells' public life: > \\"Political power itself and the attention that it brought were what mattered > to the Brownsville lawyer. In economic terms, ...numerous other South Texas > entrepreneurs overshadowed James B. Wels. Even as a highly esteemed lawyer, > he served as the agent of more successful men. Only as a political leader > did Wells stand on an equal footing with the powerful figures of the Trans- > Nueces region.... Political power had made him an important man, and he > relished the demonstration of that power in campaigns and factional > battles.\\"Anders, Boss Rule in South Texas, pg. 25. Jim Wells County was named in Wells' honor. Wells' papers are housed at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, University of Texas at Austin. Footnotes Further reading * Armando C.

He is the vocalist for New York Hardcore band Agnostic Front, street punk group Roger Miret and the Disasters, and the hardcore band The Alligators. Agnostic Front is considered to be \\"the godfathers of hardcore,\\" and one of the bands that created the New York scene.  Personal life  Miret was born in Havana, Cuba. He is the older half-brother of Madball frontman, Freddy Cricien. The two have the same mother, who is of Cuban descent, and different fathers, hence the different last names. Miret and his family fled Cuba to escape the Castro regime. Miret was incarcerated on a drug charge in the late 1980s, spending almost two years in jail. In a 2011 interview, he stated that he became involved in it because he was living in poverty, squatting buildings, and his then partner was pregnant. After being released, he started supporting PETA campaigns, as well as other non- profit organizations, and followed a vegetarian diet for many years. Nowadays, he does not smoke and does not use recreational drugs, except for an occasional drink.

It follows on Cisco's commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative. The CUD program initially involved three pilot cities: San Francisco, California; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Seoul, South Korea. These cities were selected because each had implemented or planned to implement a next-generation [broadband] (fiber and/or wireless) infrastructure. Other common factors are the significant traffic congestion issues each city faces and the fact that each is led by a visionary mayor already involved in green initiatives. In 2008 the three initial cities were joined by Lisbon, Hamburg, Madrid and Birmingham. Learnings from the CUD partnership should serve as blueprint of best practices and methodologies that other cities can use as a reference. All cities involved are strongly relying on the use of information and communication technologies to achieve their goals. CUD is an ongoing program, to deliver innovative, sustainable models for urban planning and economic development. The exchange of ideas is promoted through bi-annual conferences in which representatives of all participating cities meet, together with representatives of other interested cities. The first CUD Conference took place in February 2008 in San Francisco, the second is planned for Amsterdam in September 2008.

Originally named \\"Tuxedo Park\\" by real estate developers in 1912, the area remained undeveloped until the 1960s. The east half of Westview is located on land annexed by the city in 1911, while the western half did not become part of Saskatoon until 1960. The majority of development occurred in the 1970s and 1980s (although the neighbourhood, with the more-or-less current street layout, had appeared on city street maps as early as 1961). The neighbourhood was finally completed in the late 1990s. Located in what was at the time the northwest corner of the city, the neighbourhood was on the city's western edge, giving its residents a true \\"West view\\". Unlike its Eastview counterpart, all street names don't begin with the word \\"West\\". The population of Westview was 3,441 in 2006. The community was originally identified as Westview Heights, but the second word was dropped from the official community name in the 1980s. The Westview neighbourhood is bounded to the north by 37th Street, Circle Drive on the east and Junor Avenue on the west and 33rd Street to the south. Demographics The population of Westview was 3,441 in 2006, with an average family income of $54,374. The average household size is 2.8 residents, and approximately 60.8% of the residents own their own home.Neighbourhood Profiles According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $316,200. Governance Westview exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon West. It is currently represented by Sheri Benson of the New Democratic Party, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is within the constituency of Saskatoon Westview. It is currently represented by David Buckingham of the Saskatchewan Party, first elected in 2016. In Saskatoon's non-partisan municipal politics, Westview lies within ward 4. It is currently represented by Troy Davies, first elected in 2012.

Biography Wanda Ortiz first learned to play the bass at the age of nine, when the elementary school she attended had a music program that enabled students to sign up and choose an instrument. When she arrived late on the first day of music class, she wound up with a junior-sized double bass. While she took lessons on the double bass (also known as an upright bass), she taught herself to play electric bass at age 11 so she could play in the school jazz band. She continued playing bass throughout her school years, eventually earning a B.Mus degree from the University of California, Irvine. Before joining The Iron Maidens, Ortiz was the bassist of the band Rotten Rod & The Warheads from 1997 to 2002 and Heartache City from 1999 to 2001. In 1998 and 2004, Ortiz won the Best Female Bassist award at the Rock City News Awards and in 2003, won the best bassist award at The All Access Music Magazine Awards. In September 2002, Ortiz joined The Iron Maidens and has remained with the band ever since. As a member of The Iron Maidens, Ortiz's stage name is \\"Steph Harris\\", a female version of Iron Maiden bassist/founder Steve Harris. In addition to The Iron Maidens, Ortiz works as a freelance musician in various groups and orchestras in the Southern California area, including The South Coast Symphony Orchestra as principal bassist since 1996. She was also the bassist of an original rock/blues band called Field of Vision in 2004. Aside from Steve Harris, Ortiz cites Geddy Lee and Chris Squire among her influences.
