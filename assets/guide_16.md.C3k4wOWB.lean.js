The distinct identity many of African-American culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African-American people, including the Middle Passage. The culture is both distinct and enormously influential on American and global worldwide culture as a whole. African- American culture is rooted in the blend between the cultures of West and Central Africa and the Anglo-Celtic culture that has influenced and modified its development in the American South. Understanding its identity within the culture of the United States, it is, in the anthropological sense, conscious of its origins as largely a blend of West and Central African cultures. Although slavery greatly restricted the ability of African-Americans to practice their original cultural traditions, many practices, values and beliefs survived, and over time have modified and/or blended with European cultures and other cultures such as that of Amerindians. African-American identity was established during the slavery period, producing a dynamic culture that has had and continues to have a profound impact on American culture as a whole, as well as that of the broader world. Elaborate rituals and ceremonies were a significant part of African-Americans' ancestral culture. Many West African societies traditionally believed that spirits dwelled in their surrounding nature. From this disposition, they treated their environment with mindful care. They also generally believed that a spiritual life source existed after death and that ancestors in this spiritual realm could then mediate between the supreme Creator and the living. Honor and prayer were displayed to these \\"ancient ones\\", the spirit of that past. West Africans also believed in spiritual possession.Clayborn Carson, Emma J. Lapsansky-Werner, and Gary B. Nash, The Struggle for Freedom: A History of African Americans, Vol 1 to 1877 (Prentice Hall, 2012), p. 18. At the beginning of the 18th century, Christianity began to spread across North Africa; this shift in religion began displacing traditional African spiritual practices. The enslaved Africans brought this complex religious dynamic within their culture to America. This fusion of traditional African beliefs with Christianity provided a commonplace for those practicing religion in Africa and America. After emancipation, unique African-American traditions continued to flourish, as distinctive traditions or radical innovations in music, art, literature, religion, cuisine, and other fields. 20th-century sociologists, such as Gunnar Myrdal, believed that African-Americans had lost most of their cultural ties with Africa. But, anthropological field research by Melville Herskovits and others demonstrated that there has been a continuum of African traditions among Africans of the diaspora. The greatest influence of African cultural practices on European culture is found below the Mason-Dixon line in the American South. For many years African-American culture developed separately from American culture, both because of slavery and the persistence of racial discrimination in America, as well as African-American slave descendants' desire to create and maintain their own traditions. Today, African-American culture has influenced American culture and yet still remains a distinct cultural body. African-American cultural history From the earliest days of American slavery in the 17th century, slave owners sought to exercise control over their slaves by attempting to strip them of their African culture. The physical isolation and societal marginalization of African slaves and, later, of their free progeny, however, facilitated the retention of significant elements of traditional culture among Africans in the New World generally, and in the United States in particular. Slave owners deliberately tried to repress independent political or cultural organization in order to deal with the many slave rebellions or acts of resistance that took place in the United States, Brazil, Haiti, and the Dutch Guyanas.Price, Richard (1996). Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas. Anchor Books. pp. 1‚Äì33. African cultures, slavery, slave rebellions, and the civil rights movement have shaped African-American religious, familial, political, and economic behaviors. The imprint of Africa is evident in a myriad of ways: in politics, economics, language, music, hairstyles, fashion, dance, religion, cuisine, and worldview. In turn, African-American culture has had a pervasive, transformative impact on many elements of mainstream American culture. This process of mutual creative exchange is called creolization. Over time, the culture of African slaves and their descendants has been ubiquitous in its impact on not only the dominant American culture, but on world culture as well.Genevi√®ve Fabre, Robert G. O'Meally (1994). History and Memory in African-American Culture. Oxford University Press. pp. 12‚Äì208. =Oral tradition= Slaveholders limited or prohibited education of enslaved African- Americans because they feared it might empower their chattel and inspire or enable emancipatory ambitions. In the United States, the legislation that denied slaves formal education likely contributed to their maintaining a strong oral tradition, a common feature of indigenous African cultures. African-based oral traditions became the primary means of preserving history, mores, and other cultural information among the people. This was consistent with the griot practices of oral history in many African and other cultures that did not rely on the written word. Many of these cultural elements have been passed from generation to generation through storytelling. The folktales provided African-Americans the opportunity to inspire and educate one another. Examples of African American folktales include trickster tales of Br'er Rabbit and heroic tales such as that of John Henry. The Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris helped to bring African-American folk tales into mainstream adoption. Harris did not appreciate the complexity of the stories nor their potential for a lasting impact on society. Other narratives that appear as important, recurring motifs in African-American culture are the \\"Signifying Monkey\\", \\"The Ballad of Shine\\", and the legend of Stagger Lee. The legacy of the African-American oral tradition manifests in diverse forms. African- American preachers tend to perform rather than simply speak. The emotion of the subject is carried through the speaker's tone, volume, and cadence, which tend to mirror the rising action, climax, and descending action of the sermon. The meaning of this manner of preaching is not easily understood by Euro Americans or others of non-African origin. Often song, dance, verse, and structured pauses are placed throughout the sermon. Call and response is another pervasive element of the African-American oral tradition. It manifests in worship in what is commonly referred to as the \\"amen corner\\". In direct contrast to the tradition present in American and European cultures, it is an acceptable and common audience reaction to interrupt and affirm the speaker. This pattern of interaction is also in evidence in music, particularly in blues and jazz forms. Hyperbolic and provocative, even incendiary, rhetoric is another aspect of African-American oral tradition often evident in the pulpit in a tradition sometimes referred to as \\"prophetic speech\\".Fabre and O'Meally, pp. 219‚Äì244. Modernity and migration of black communities to the North has had a history of placing strain on the retention of black cultural practices and traditions. The urban and radically different spaces in which black culture was being produced raised fears in anthropologists and sociologists that the southern black folk aspect of black popular culture were at risk of being lost in history. The study over the fear of losing black popular cultural roots from the South have a topic of interest to many anthropologists, who among them include Zora Neale Hurston. Through her extensive studies of Southern folklore and cultural practices, Hurston has claimed that the popular Southern folklore traditions and practices are not dying off. Instead they are evolving, developing, and re-creating themselves in different regions. Other aspects of African-American oral tradition include the dozens, signifying, trash talk, rhyming, semantic inversion and word play, many of which have found their way into mainstream American popular culture and become international phenomena.Michael L. Hecht, Ronald L. Jackson, Sidney A. Ribeau (2003). African American Communication: Exploring Identity and Culture? Routledge. pp. 3‚Äì245. Spoken-word poetry is another example of how the African-American oral tradition has influenced modern popular culture. Spoken- word artists employ the same techniques as African-American preachers including movement, rhythm, and audience participation. Rap music from the 1980s and beyond has been seen as an extension of African oral culture. =Harlem Renaissance= Zora Neale Hurston was a prominent literary figure during the Harlem Renaissance The first major public recognition of African- American culture occurred during the Harlem Renaissance pioneered by Alain Locke. In the 1920s and 1930s, African-American music, literature, and art gained wide notice. Authors such as Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen and poets such as Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, and Countee Cullen wrote works describing the African-American experience. Jazz, swing, blues and other musical forms entered American popular music. African-American artists such as William H. Johnson and Palmer Hayden created unique works of art featuring African Americans. The Harlem Renaissance was also a time of increased political involvement for African Americans. Among the notable African- American political movements founded in the early 20th century are the Universal Negro Improvement Association and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The Nation of Islam, a notable quasi-Islamic religious movement, also began in the early 1930s. =African-American cultural movement= The Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s followed in the wake of the non-violent Civil Rights Movement. The movement promoted racial pride and ethnic cohesion in contrast to the focus on integration of the Civil Rights Movement, and adopted a more militant posture in the face of racism. It also inspired a new renaissance in African-American literary and artistic expression generally referred to as the African-American or \\"Black Arts Movement\\". The works of popular recording artists such as Nina Simone (\\"Young, Gifted and Black\\") and The Impressions (\\"Keep On Pushing\\"), as well as the poetry, fine arts, and literature of the time, shaped and reflected the growing racial and political consciousness. Among the most prominent writers of the African-American Arts Movement were poet Nikki Giovanni; poet and publisher Don L. Lee, who later became known as Haki Madhubuti; poet and playwright Leroi Jones, later known as Amiri Baraka; and Sonia Sanchez. Other influential writers were Ed Bullins, Dudley Randall, Mari Evans, June Jordan, Larry Neal, and Ahmos Zu-Bolton. Another major aspect of the African-American Arts Movement was the infusion of the African aesthetic, a return to a collective cultural sensibility and ethnic pride that was much in evidence during the Harlem Renaissance and in the celebration of N√©gritude among the artistic and literary circles in the US, Caribbean, and the African continent nearly four decades earlier: the idea that \\"black is beautiful\\". During this time, there was a resurgence of interest in, and an embrace of, elements of African culture within African-American culture that had been suppressed or devalued to conform to Eurocentric America. Natural hairstyles, such as the afro, and African clothing, such as the dashiki, gained popularity. More importantly, the African-American aesthetic encouraged personal pride and political awareness among African Americans. Music Thelonious Monk in 1947. Composer Duke Ellington, pictured receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Richard Nixon, is often held to be one of the most influential musical figures of the 20th century. African-American music is rooted in the typically polyrhythmic music of the ethnic groups of Africa, specifically those in the Western, Sahelean, and Sub-Saharan regions. African oral traditions, nurtured in slavery, encouraged the use of music to pass on history, teach lessons, ease suffering, and relay messages. The African pedigree of African-American music is evident in some common elements: call and response, syncopation, percussion, improvisation, swung notes, blue notes, the use of falsetto, melisma, and complex multi-part harmony. During slavery, Africans in America blended traditional European hymns with African elements to create spirituals. The banjo was the first African derived instrument to be played and built in the United States. Slaveholders discovered African- American slaves used drums to communicate. Many African Americans sing \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" in addition to the American national anthem, \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\", or in lieu of it. Written by James Weldon Johnson and John Rosamond Johnson in 1900 to be performed for the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the song was, and continues to be, a popular way for African Americans to recall past struggles and express ethnic solidarity, faith, and hope for the future. The song was adopted as the \\"Negro National Anthem\\" by the NAACP in 1919. Many African-American children are taught the song at school, church or by their families. \\"Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing\\" traditionally is sung immediately following, or instead of, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" at events hosted by African-American churches, schools, and other organizations. In the 19th century, as the result of the blackface minstrel show, African-American music entered mainstream American society. By the early 20th century, several musical forms with origins in the African-American community had transformed American popular music. Aided by the technological innovations of radio and phonograph records, ragtime, jazz, blues, and swing also became popular overseas, and the 1920s became known as the Jazz Age. The early 20th century also saw the creation of the first African-American Broadway shows, films such as King Vidor's Hallelujah!, and operas such as George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. Rock and roll, doo wop, soul, and R&B; developed in the mid-20th century. These genres became very popular in white audiences and were influences for other genres such as surf. During the 1970s, the dozens, an urban African-American tradition of using rhyming slang to put down one's enemies (or friends), and the West Indian tradition of toasting developed into a new form of music. In the South Bronx the half speaking, half singing rhythmic street talk of \\"rapping\\" grew into the hugely successful cultural force known as hip hop. =Contemporary= Hip hop would become a multicultural movement, however, it still remained important to many African Americans. The African-American Cultural Movement of the 1960s and 1970s also fueled the growth of funk and later hip-hop forms such as rap, hip house, new jack swing, and go-go. House music was created in black communities in Chicago in the 1980s. African-American music has experienced far more widespread acceptance in American popular music in the 21st century than ever before. In addition to continuing to develop newer musical forms, modern artists have also started a rebirth of older genres in the form of genres such as neo soul and modern funk-inspired groups. In contemporary art, black subject matter has been used as raw material to portray the Black experience and aesthetics. The way Blacks' facial features were once conveyed as stereotypical in media and entertainment continues to be an influence within art. Dichotomies arise from artworks such as Open Casket by Dana Schutz based on the murder of Emmett Till to remove the painting and destroy it from the way Black pain is conveyed. Meanwhile, Black artists such as Kerry James Marshall portrays the Black body as empowerment and Black invisibility. Mumble rap originated from African American Vernacular English. Another popular African-American genre is trap music. African-American music influenced other countries such as Nigeria. Hip- hop has been adopted by White Americans. Since the 1980‚Äôs, White rappers such as Eminem, and Vanilla Ice have emerged.https://fisherpub.sjfc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&context;=journal3690 Mumble rap conforms to African-American Vernacular English.http://www.idpublications.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Full-Paper- MUMBLE-IN-THE-BRONX-A-SOCIO-CULTURAL-ANALYSIS-OF-‚ÄòMUMBLE-RAP‚Äô-AS- ENVIRONMENTAL-DISCOURSE.pdf Mumble rap emerged in 2012 with Atlanta rapper Future‚Äôs song ‚ÄúTony Montana‚Äù.

Dance in the African tradition, and thus in the tradition of slaves, was a part of both everyday life and special occasions. Many of these traditions such as get down, ring shouts, and other elements of African body language survive as elements of modern dance. In the 19th century, African-American dance began to appear in minstrel shows. These shows often presented African Americans as caricatures for ridicule to large audiences. The first African-American dance to become popular with white dancers was the cakewalk in 1891. Later dances to follow in this tradition include the Charleston, the Lindy Hop, the Jitterbug and the swing.Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader. Julie Malnig. Edition: illustrated. University of Illinois Press. 2009, pp. 19‚Äì23. During the Harlem Renaissance, African-American Broadway shows such as Shuffle Along helped to establish and legitimize African- American dancers. African-American dance forms such as tap, a combination of African and European influences, gained widespread popularity thanks to dancers such as Bill Robinson and were used by leading white choreographers, who often hired African-American dancers. Contemporary African-American dance is descended from these earlier forms and also draws influence from African and Caribbean dance forms. Groups such as the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater have continued to contribute to the growth of this form. Modern popular dance in America is also greatly influenced by African-American dance. American popular dance has also drawn many influences from African-American dance most notably in the hip-hop genre. One of the uniquely African-American forms of dancing, turfing, emerged from social and political movements in the East Bay in the San Francisco Bay Area.Bragin, Naomi Elizabeth. \\"Black Street Movement: Turf Dance, YAK Films and Politics of Sitation in Oakland, California.\\" [\\"Collected Work: Dance and the social city.

Twerking is an African-American dance similar to dances from Africa in Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Senegal, Somalia and the Congo. =Art= African-American sculpture From its early origins in slave communities, through the end of the 20th century, African-American art has made a vital contribution to the art of the United States. During the period between the 17th century and the early 19th century, art took the form of small drums, quilts, wrought-iron figures, and ceramic vessels in the southern United States. These artifacts have similarities with comparable crafts in West and Central Africa. In contrast, African-American artisans like the New England‚Äìbased engraver Scipio Moorhead and the Baltimore portrait painter Joshua Johnson created art that was conceived in a thoroughly western European fashion. During the 19th century, Harriet Powers made quilts in rural Georgia, United States that are now considered among the finest examples of 19th- century Southern quilting. Later in the 20th century, the women of Gee's Bend developed a distinctive, bold, and sophisticated quilting style based on traditional African-American quilts with a geometric simplicity that developed separately but was like that of Amish quilts and modern art. Midnight Golfer by Eugene J. Martin, mixed-media collage on rag paper After the American Civil War, museums and galleries began more frequently to display the work of African-American artists. Cultural expression in mainstream venues was still limited by the dominant European aesthetic and by racial prejudice. To increase the visibility of their work, many African-American artists traveled to Europe where they had greater freedom. It was not until the Harlem Renaissance that more European Americans began to pay attention to African- American art in America.Southern, Eileen. Music of Negro Americans: A History. New York: Norton, 1997, pp. 404‚Äì409. During the 1920s, artists such as Raymond Barth√©, Aaron Douglas, Augusta Savage, and photographer James Van Der Zee became well known for their work. During the Great Depression, new opportunities arose for these and other African-American artists under the WPA. In later years, other programs and institutions, such as the New York City-based Harmon Foundation, helped to foster African-American artistic talent. Augusta Savage, Elizabeth Catlett, Lois Mailou Jones, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, and others exhibited in museums and juried art shows, and built reputations and followings for themselves. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were very few widely accepted African-American artists. Despite this, The Highwaymen, a loose association of 27 African-American artists from Ft. Pierce, Florida, created idyllic, quickly realized images of the Florida landscape and peddled some 50,000 of them from the trunks of their cars. They sold their art directly to the public rather than through galleries and art agents, thus receiving the name \\"The Highwaymen\\". Rediscovered in the mid-1990s, today they are recognized as an important part of American folk history. Their artwork is widely collected by enthusiasts and original pieces can easily fetch thousands of dollars in auctions and sales.Painting by a Florida Highwayman The Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s was another period of resurgent interest in African-American art. During this period, several African-American artists gained national prominence, among them Lou Stovall, Ed Love, Charles White, and Jeff Donaldson. Donaldson and a group of African-American artists formed the Afrocentric collective AfriCOBRA, which remains in existence today. The sculptor Martin Puryear, whose work has been acclaimed for years, was being honored with a 30-year retrospective of his work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in November 2007. Notable contemporary African-American artists include Willie Cole, David Hammons, Eugene J. Martin, Mose Tolliver, Reynold Ruffins, the late William Tolliver, and Kara Walker. =Literature= African-American literature has its roots in the oral traditions of African slaves in America. The slaves used stories and fables in much the same way as they used music. These stories influenced the earliest African-American writers and poets in the 18th century such as Phillis Wheatley and Olaudah Equiano. These authors reached early high points by telling slave narratives. During the early 20th century Harlem Renaissance, numerous authors and poets, such as Langston Hughes, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Booker T. Washington, grappled with how to respond to discrimination in America. Authors during the Civil Rights Movement, such as Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about issues of racial segregation, oppression, and other aspects of African-American life. This tradition continues today with authors who have been accepted as an integral part of American literature, with works such as Roots: The Saga of an American Family by Alex Haley, The Color Purple by Alice Walker, Beloved by Nobel Prize- winning Toni Morrison, and fiction works by Octavia Butler and Walter Mosley. Such works have achieved both best-selling and/or award-winning status. Museums National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. The African-American Museum Movement emerged during the 1950s and 1960s to preserve the heritage of the African-American experience and to ensure its proper interpretation in American history. Museums devoted to African-American history are found in many African-American neighborhoods. Institutions such as the African American Museum and Library at Oakland, The African American Museum in Cleveland and the Natchez Museum of African American History and CultureNatchez Museum Showcases African American Heritage Today in Mississippi. Retrieved March 2, 2016. were created by African Americans to teach and investigate cultural history that, until recent decades, was primarily preserved through oral traditions.\\"African-American Museums, History, and the American Ideal\\" by John E. Fleming. Journal of American History, Vol. 81, No. 3, The Practice of American History: A Special Issue (December 1994), pp. 1020‚Äì1026. Other prominent museums include Chicago's DuSable Museum of African American History, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, established in 2003 as part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Language Generations of hardships imposed on the African-American community created distinctive language patterns. Slave owners often intentionally mixed people who spoke different African languages to discourage communication in any language other than English. This, combined with prohibitions against education, led to the development of pidgins, simplified mixtures of two or more languages that speakers of different languages could use to communicate. Examples of pidgins that became fully developed languages include Creole, common to Louisiana, and Gullah, common to the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia. African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is a variety (dialect, ethnolect, and sociolect) of the American English language closely associated with the speech of, but not exclusive to, African Americans. While AAVE is academically considered a legitimate dialect because of its logical structure, some of both whites and African Americans consider it slang or the result of a poor command of Standard American English. Many African Americans who were born outside the American South still speak with hints of AAVE or southern dialect. Inner-city African-American children who are isolated by speaking only AAVE sometimes have more difficulty with standardized testing and, after school, moving to the mainstream world for work. It is common for many speakers of AAVE to code switch between AAVE and Standard American English depending on the setting. Fashion and aesthetics =Attire= The Black Arts Movement, a cultural explosion of the 1960s, saw the incorporation of surviving cultural dress with elements from modern fashion and West African traditional clothing to create a uniquely African-American traditional style. Kente cloth is the best known African textile. These colorful woven patterns, which exist in numerous varieties, were originally made by the Ashanti and Ewe peoples of Ghana and Togo. Kente fabric also appears in a number of Western style fashions ranging from casual T-shirts to formal bow ties and cummerbunds. Kente strips are often sewn into liturgical and academic robes or worn as stoles. Since the Black Arts Movement, traditional African clothing has been popular amongst African Americans for both formal and informal occasions. Other manifestations of traditional African dress in common evidence in African-American culture are vibrant colors, mud cloth, trade beads and the use of Adinkra motifs in jewelry and in couture and decorator fabrics. Another common aspect of fashion in African-American culture involves the appropriate dress for worship in the Black church. It is expected in most churches that an individual present their best appearance for worship. African-American women in particular are known for wearing vibrant dresses and suits. An interpretation of a passage from the Christian Bible, \\"...every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head...\\", has led to the tradition of wearing elaborate Sunday hats, sometimes known as \\"crowns\\". Hip hop fashion is popular with African Americans. Grillz were made popular by African American rapper Nelly. Sagging pants was a part of African American culture. Air Jordan, a shoe brand that's named after former African American basketball player Michael Jordan is very popular among the African-American community. =Hair= Hair styling in African-American culture is greatly varied. African-American hair is typically composed of coiled curls, which range from tight to wavy. Many women choose to wear their hair in its natural state. Natural hair can be styled in a variety of ways, including the afro, twist outs, braid outs, and wash and go styles. It is a myth that natural hair presents styling problems or is hard to manage; this myth seems prevalent because mainstream culture has, for decades, attempted to get African-American women to conform to its standard of beauty (i.e., straight hair). To that end, some women prefer straightening of the hair through the application of heat or chemical processes. Although this can be a matter of personal preference, the choice is often affected by straight hair being a beauty standard in the West and the fact that hair type can affect employment. However, more and more women are wearing their hair in its natural state and receiving positive feedback. Alternatively, the predominant and most socially acceptable practice for men is to leave one's hair natural. Often, as men age and begin to lose their hair, the hair is either closely cropped, or the head is shaved completely free of hair. However, since the 1960s, natural hairstyles, such as the afro, braids, waves, fades, and dreadlocks, have been growing in popularity. Despite their association with radical political movements and their vast difference from mainstream Western hairstyles, the styles have attained considerable, but certainly limited, social acceptance. Maintaining facial hair is more prevalent among African-American men than in other male populations in the US.Lacy, D. Aaron.The Most Endangered Title VII Plaintiff?: African-American Males and Intersectional Claims.\\" Nebraska Law Review, Vol. 86, No. 3, 2008, pp. 14‚Äì15. Retrieved November 8, 2007. In fact, the soul patch is so named because African-American men, particularly jazz musicians, popularized the style.Green, Penelope.\\"Ranting; Stubble trouble.\\" The New York Times, November 8, 2007. Retrieved November 8, 2007. The preference for facial hair among African-American men is due partly to personal taste, but also because they are more prone than other ethnic groups to develop a condition known as pseudofolliculitis barbae, commonly referred to as razor bumps, many prefer not to shave. =Body image= European-Americans have sometimes appropriated different hair braiding techniques and other forms of African- American hair. There are also individuals and groups who are working towards raising the standing of the African aesthetic among African Americans and internationally as well. This includes efforts toward promoting as models those with clearly defined African features; the mainstreaming of natural hairstyles; and, in women, fuller, more voluptuous body types. Religion While African Americans practice a number of religions, Protestant Christianity is by far the most prevalent. Additionally, 14 percent of Muslims in the United States and Canada are black. =Christianity= A river baptism in New Bern, North Carolina, near the turn of the 20th century The religious institutions of African-American Christians commonly are referred to collectively as the black church. During slavery, many slaves were stripped of their African belief systems and typically denied free religious practice, forced to become Christian. Slaves managed, however, to hang on to some practices by integrating them into Christian worship in secret meetings. These practices, including dance, shouts, African rhythms, and enthusiastic singing, remain a large part of worship in the African-American church. African- American churches taught that all people were equal in God's eyes and viewed the doctrine of obedience to one's master taught in white churches as hypocritical ‚Äì yet accepted and propagated internal hierarchies and support for corporal punishment of children among other things. Instead the African- American church focused on the message of equality and hopes for a better future. Before and after emancipation, racial segregation in America prompted the development of organized African-American denominations. The first of these was the AME Church founded by Richard Allen in 1787. After the Civil War the merger of three smaller Baptist groups formed the National Baptist Convention. This organization is the largest African-American Christian Denomination and the second largest Baptist denomination in the United States. An African-American church is not necessarily a separate denomination. Several predominantly African-American churches exist as members of predominantly white denominations. African-American churches have served to provide African- American people with leadership positions and opportunities to organize that were denied in mainstream American society. Because of this, African-American pastors became the bridge between the African-American and European American communities and thus played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement. Like many Christians, African-American Christians sometimes participate in or attend a Christmas play. Black Nativity by Langston Hughes is a re-telling of the classic Nativity story with gospel music. Productions can be found in African-American theaters and churches all over the country. Malcolm X, a notable African American Muslim, became a member of the Nation of Islam but later converted to Sunni Islam. =Islam= Generations before the advent of the Atlantic slave trade, Islam was a thriving religion in West Africa due to its peaceful introduction via the lucrative Trans-Saharan trade between prominent tribes in the southern Sahara and the Arabs and Berbers in North Africa. In his attesting to this fact the West African scholar Cheikh Anta Diop explained: \\"The primary reason for the success of Islam in Black Africa [...] consequently stems from the fact that it was propagated peacefully at first by solitary Arabo-Berber travelers to certain Black kings and notables, who then spread it about them to those under their jurisdiction\\".Cheikh Anta Diop, Precolonial Black Africa, p. 163. Many first-generation slaves were often able to retain their Muslim identity, their descendants were not. Slaves were either forcibly converted to Christianity as was the case in the Catholic lands or were besieged with gross inconveniences to their religious practice such as in the case of the Protestant American mainland.Sylvaine Diouf, Servants of Allah In the decades after slavery and particularly during the depression era, Islam reemerged in the form of highly visible and sometimes controversial movements in the African-American community. The first of these of note was the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Noble Drew Ali. Ali had a profound influence on Wallace Fard, who later founded the Black nationalist Nation of Islam in 1930. Elijah Muhammad became head of the organization in 1934. Much like Malcolm X, who left the Nation of Islam in 1964, many African-American Muslims now follow traditional Islam. Many former members of the Nation of Islam converted to Sunni Islam when Warith Deen Mohammed took control of the organization after his father's death in 1975 and taught its members the traditional form of Islam based on the Qur'an. A survey by the Council on American-Islamic Relations shows that 30% of Sunni Mosque attendees are African Americans. In fact, most African-American Muslims are orthodox Muslims, as only 2% are of the Nation of Islam. =Judaism= There are 150,000 African Americans in the United States who practice Judaism.Rachel Pomerance, Judaism Drawing More Black Americans, The Atlanta Journal- Constitution, June 18, 2008. Some of these are members of mainstream Jewish groups like the Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox branches of Judaism; others belong to non-mainstream Jewish groups like the Black Hebrew Israelites. The Black Hebrew Israelites are a collection of African-American religious organizations whose practices and beliefs are derived to some extent from Judaism. Their varied teachings often include, that African Americans are descended from the Biblical Israelites. Studies have shown in the last 10 to 15 years there has been major increase in African-Americans identifying as Jewish. Rabbi Capers Funnye, the first cousin of Michelle Obama, says in response to skepticism by some on people being African-American and Jewish at the same time, \\"I am a Jew, and that breaks through all color and ethnic barriers.\\"Niko Koppel, Black Rabbi Reaches Out to Mainstream of His Faith, The New York Times, March 16, 2008. =Other religions= Aside from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, there are also African Americans who follow Buddhism and a number of other religions. There is a small but growing number of African Americans who participate in African traditional religions, such as West African Vodun, Santer√≠a, If√° and diasporic traditions like the Rastafari movement. Many of them are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean and South America, where these are practiced. Because of religious practices, such as animal sacrifice, which are no longer common among the larger American religions, these groups may be viewed negatively and are sometimes the victims of harassment. It must be stated, however, that since the Supreme Court judgement that was given to the Lukumi Babaluaye church of Florida in 1993, there has been no major legal challenge to their right to function as they see fit. =Irreligious beliefs= In a 2008 Pew Forum survey, 12% of African Americans described themselves as nothing in particular (11%), agnostic (1%), or atheist (<0.5%). Life events For most African Americans, the observance of life events follows the pattern of mainstream American culture. While African Americans and whites often lived to themselves for much of American history, both groups generally had the same perspective on American culture. There are some traditions that are unique to African Americans. Some African Americans have created new rites of passage that are linked to African traditions. Some pre-teen and teenage boys and girls take classes to prepare them for adulthood. These classes tend to focus on spirituality, responsibility, and leadership. Many of these programs are modeled after traditional African ceremonies, with the focus largely on embracing African cultures. To this day, some African-American couples choose to \\"jump the broom\\" as a part of their wedding ceremony. Some sources claim that this practice can be traced back to Ghana. However, other sources argue that the African American tradition of \\"jumping the broom\\" is far more similar to the tradition in Rural England. Although, this tradition largely fell out of favor in the African-American community after the end of slavery, it has experienced a slight resurgence in recent years as some couples seek to reaffirm their African heritage. Funeral traditions tend to vary based on a number of factors, including religion and location, but there are a number of commonalities. Probably the most important part of death and dying in the African-American culture is the gathering of family and friends. Either in the last days before death or shortly after death, typically any friends and family members that can be reached are notified. This gathering helps to provide spiritual and emotional support, as well as assistance in making decisions and accomplishing everyday tasks. The spirituality of death is very important in African-American culture. A member of the clergy or members of the religious community, or both, are typically present with the family through the entire process. Death is often viewed as transitory rather than final. Many services are called homegoings or homecomings, instead of funerals, based on the belief that the person is going home to the afterlife; \\"Returning to God\\" or the earth (also see Euphemism as well as Connotation). The entire end of life process is generally treated as a celebration of the person's life, deeds and accomplishments ‚Äì the \\"good things\\" rather than a mourning of loss. This is most notably demonstrated in the New Orleans jazz funeral tradition where upbeat music, dancing, and food encourage those gathered to be happy and celebrate the homegoing of a beloved friend. Cuisine In studying of the African American culture, food cannot be left out as one of the medians to understand their traditions, religion, interaction, and social and cultural structures of their community. Observing the ways they prepare their food and eat their food ever since the enslaved era, reveals about the nature and identity of African American culture in the United States.Hicks, Derek S. \\"An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion.\\" In Religion, Food, and Eating in North America, edited by Benjamin E. Zeller, Marie W. Dallam, Reid L. Neilson, and Nora L. Rubel, 134-154. New York: Columbia University Press, 2014. Derek Hicks examines the origins of \\"gumbo\\", which is considered a soul food to many African Americans, in his reference to the intertwinement of food and culture in African American community. No written evidence are found historically about the gumbo or its recipes, so through the African American's nature of orally passing their stories and recipes down, gumbo came to represent their truly communal dish. Gumbo is said to be \\"an invention of enslaved Africans and African Americans\\" in Louisiana.Hicks, Derek S. \\"An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion.\\" In Religion, Food, and Eating in North America, edited by Benjamin E. Zeller, Marie W. Dallam, Reid L. Neilson, and Nora L. Rubel, 136. New York: Columbia University Press, 2014. By mixing and cooking leftover ingredients from their White owners (often less desirable cuts of meats and vegetables) all together into a dish that has consistency between stew and soup, African Americans took the detestable and created it into a desirable dish. Through sharing of this food in churches with a gathering of their people, they not only shared the food, but also experience, feelings, attachment, and sense of unity that brings the community together. Kennedy Fried Chicken, which is known for serving soul food, has many outlets in African American communities. The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States, such as yams, peanuts, rice, okra, sorghum, indigo dyes, and cotton, can be traced to African influences. African-American foods reflect creative responses to racial and economic oppression and poverty. Under slavery, African Americans were not allowed to eat better cuts of meat, and after emancipation many were often too poor to afford them. A traditional soul food dinner consisting of fried chicken with macaroni and cheese, collard greens, breaded fried okra and cornbread. Soul food, a hearty cuisine commonly associated with African Americans in the South (but also common to African Americans nationwide), makes creative use of inexpensive products procured through farming and subsistence hunting and fishing. Pig intestines are boiled and sometimes battered and fried to make chitterlings, also known as \\"chitlins\\". Ham hocks and neck bones provide seasoning to soups, beans and boiled greens (turnip greens, collard greens, and mustard greens). Other common foods, such as fried chicken and fish, macaroni and cheese, cornbread, and hoppin' john (black-eyed peas and rice) are prepared simply. When the African-American population was considerably more rural than it generally is today, rabbit, opossum, squirrel, and waterfowl were important additions to the diet. Many of these food traditions are especially predominant in many parts of the rural South. Traditionally prepared soul food is often high in fat, sodium, and starch. Highly suited to the physically demanding lives of laborers, farmhands and rural lifestyles generally, it is now a contributing factor to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes in a population that has become increasingly more urban and sedentary. As a result, more health-conscious African Americans are using alternative methods of preparation, eschewing trans fats in favor of natural vegetable oils and substituting smoked turkey for fatback and other, cured pork products; limiting the amount of refined sugar in desserts; and emphasizing the consumption of more fruits and vegetables than animal protein. There is some resistance to such changes, however, as they involve deviating from long culinary tradition. Other soul foods African Americans cook is chicken and waffles and desserts like banana pudding, peach cobbler, red velvet cake and sweet potato pie. Kool-Aid is considered a soul food beverage. The roots of \\"Soul food\\" are spread up and down the West Coast of Africa (Senegal, Guinea, Sierre Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Cameroon, Gabon, Nigeria and Angola) as well as in Western European countries such as England and Scotland, but the \\"fruits\\" can be found across the face of America. Okra came from Ethiopia and Eritrea. Rice, common to Lowcountry region of South Carolina and Georgia, was imported from the island of Madagascar. Soul food is similar to gypsy cooking in Europe. Holidays and observances As with other American racial and ethnic groups, African Americans observe ethnic holidays alongside traditional American holidays. Holidays observed in African-American culture are not only observed by African Americans but are widely considered American holidays. The birthday of noted American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. has been observed nationally since 1983. It is one of four federal holidays named for an individual. Black History Month is another example of another African-American observance that has been adopted nationally and its teaching is even required by law in some states. Black History Month is an attempt to focus attention on previously neglected aspects of the American history, chiefly the lives and stories of African Americans. It is observed during the month of February to coincide with the founding of the NAACP and the birthdays of Frederick Douglass, a prominent African-American abolitionist, and Abraham Lincoln, the United States president who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. On June 7, 1979, President Jimmy Carter decreed that June would be the month of black music. For the past 28 years, presidents have announced to Americans that Black Music Month (also called African- American Music Month) should be recognized as a critical part of American heritage. Black Music Month is highlighted with various events urging citizens to revel in the many forms of music from gospel to hip-hop. African-American musicians, singers, and composers are also highlighted for their contributions to the nation's history and culture. Less-widely observed outside of the African-American community is Emancipation Day popularly known as Juneteenth or Freedom Day, in recognition of the official reading of the Emancipation Proclamation on June 19, 1865, in Texas. Juneteenth is a day when African Americans reflect on their unique history and heritage. It is one of the fastest growing African-American holidays with observances in the United States. Another holiday not widely observed outside of the African-American community is the birthday of Malcolm X. The day is observed on May 19 in American cities with a significant African-American population, including Washington, D.C. Another noted African-American holiday is Kwanzaa. Like Emancipation Day, it is not widely observed outside of the African-American community, although it is growing in popularity with both African-American and African communities. African-American scholar and activist \\"Maulana\\" Ron Karenga invented the festival of Kwanzaa in 1966, as an alternative to the increasing commercialization of Christmas. Derived from the harvest rituals of Africans, Kwanzaa is observed each year from December 26 through January 1. Participants in Kwanzaa celebrations affirm their African heritage and the importance of family and community by drinking from a unity cup; lighting red, black, and green candles; exchanging heritage symbols, such as African art; and recounting the lives of people who struggled for African and African- American freedom. Negro Election Day is also another festival derived from rituals of African culture specifically West Africa and revolves around the voting of a black official in New England colonies during the 18th century. Names Although many African-American names are common among the larger population of the United States, distinct naming trends have emerged within African-American culture. Prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture. A dramatic shift in naming traditions began to take shape in the 1960s and 1970s in America. With the rise of the mid-century Civil Rights Movement, there was a dramatic rise in names of various origins. The practice of adopting neo- African or Islamic names gained popularity during that era. Efforts to recover African heritage inspired selection of names with deeper cultural significance. Before this, using African names was uncommon because African Americans were several generations removed from the last ancestor to have an African name, as slaves were often given European names and most surnames are of Anglo origin. African-American names have origins in many languages including French, Latin, English, Arabic, and African languages. One very notable influence on African-American names is the Muslim religion. Islamic names entered the popular culture with the rise of The Nation of Islam among Black Americans with its focus on civil rights. The popular name \\"Aisha\\" has origins in the Qur'an. Despite the origins of these names in the Muslim religion and the place of the Nation of Islam in the civil rights movement, many Muslim names such as Jamal and Malik entered popular usage among Black Americans simply because they were fashionable, and many Islamic names are now commonly used by African Americans regardless of their religion. Names of African origin began to crop up as well. Names like Ashanti, Tanisha, Aaliyah, Malaika have origins in the continent of Africa. By the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common within the culture to invent new names, although many of the invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as or and suffixes such as and are common, as well as inventive spellings for common names. Even with the rise of creative names, it is also still common for African Americans to use biblical, historic, or European names. Family When slavery was practiced in the United States, it was common for families to be separated through sale. Even during slavery, however, many African-American families managed to maintain strong familial bonds. Free African men and women, who managed to buy their own freedom by being hired out, who were emancipated, or who had escaped their masters, often worked long and hard to buy the members of their families who remained in bondage and send for them. Others, separated from blood kin, formed close bonds based on fictive kin; play relations, play aunts, cousins, and the like. This practice, a holdover from African oral traditions such as sanankouya, survived Emancipation, with non-blood family friends commonly accorded the status and titles of blood relations. This broader, more African concept of what constitutes family and community, and the deeply rooted respect for elders that is part of African traditional societies, may be the genesis of the common use of the terms like \\"cousin\\" (or \\"cuz\\"), \\"aunt\\", \\"uncle\\", \\"brother\\", \\"sister\\", \\"Mother\\", and \\"Mama\\" when addressing other African-American people, some of whom may be complete strangers. =African-American family structure= Immediately after slavery, African-American families struggled to reunite and rebuild what had been taken. As late as 1960, when most African Americans lived under some form of segregation, 78 percent of African-American families were headed by married couples. This number steadily declined during the latter half of the 20th century.Thomas Sowell, Affirmative Action around the World, 2004. Basic Books. pp. 115‚Äì156. For the first time since slavery, a majority of African-American children live in a household with only one parent, typically the mother. This apparent weakness is balanced by mutual-aid systems established by extended family members to provide emotional and economic support. Older family members pass on social and cultural traditions such as religion and manners to younger family members. In turn, the older family members are cared for by younger family members when they cannot care for themselves. These relationships exist at all economic levels in the African-American community, providing strength and support both to the African-American family and the community. Politics and social issues Since the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, African Americans are voting and being elected to public office in increasing numbers. the United States had approximately 10,000 African-American elected officials. African Americans overwhelmingly associate with the Democratic Party. Only 11 percent of African Americans supported for George W. Bush in the 2004 Presidential Election. In 2016, Only 8% of African Americans voted for Republican Donald Trump while 88% of African Americans voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton.https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37922587 Social issues such as racial profiling, racial disparities in sentencing, higher rates of poverty, lower access to health care and institutional racism in general are important to the African-American community. While the divide on racial and fiscal issues has remained consistently wide for decades, seemingly indicating a wide social divide, African Americans tend to hold the same optimism and concern for America as any other ethnic group. African-Americans may express political and social sentiments through hip-hop culture, including graffiti, break-dancing, rapping, and more.Richardson, Elaine and Gwendolyn Pough. \\"Hiphop Literacies and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture.\\" Social Identities, vol. 22, no. 2, Mar. 2016, pp. 129‚Äì132.Nelson, Angela M. \\"Black Popular Culture (US).\\" Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, edited by Patrick L. Mason, 2nd ed., vol. 1, Macmillan Reference USA, 2013, pp. 275‚Äì284.Dodds, Sherril. \\"Hip Hop Battles and Facial Intertexts.\\" Dance Research, vol. 34, no. 1, May 2016, pp. 63‚Äì83. This cultural movement makes statements about historical, as well as present-day topics like street culture and incarceration, and oftentimes expresses a call for change.Kitwana, Bakari. The Hip Hop Generation : Young Blacks and the Crisis in African American Culture. New York : Basic Civitas, 2002, 2002.Porfilio, Brad J.1, et al. \\"Ending the 'War against Youth:' Social Media and Hip-Hop Culture as Sites of Resistance, Transformation and (Re) Conceptualization.\\" Journal for Critical Education Policy Studies (JCEPS), vol. 11, no. 4, November 2013, pp. 85‚Äì105. Hip-hop artists play a prominent role in activism and in fighting social injustices, and have a cultural role in defining and reflecting on political and social issues. African Americans in general differ from whites in their condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay-rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands in stark contrast to the down-low phenomenon of covert male‚Äìmale sexual acts. Some within the African-American community take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton.Sharpton Pledges Fight Against Homophobia Among Blacks, The New York Sun, August 3, 2005. \\"Rev. Sharpton has pledged to jumpstart a grassroots movement that would address the issue of homophobia in the black community. [...] Al Sharpton was the only presidential candidate last year who unapologetically supported gay marriage, surprising critics who have tried to label him as a one-issue activist. [...] Rev. Sharpton, who marched in the Gay Pride Parade this year for the first time, is perhaps the very person who can make a dent in the rampant homophobic views so entrenched in the African-American community.\\" Sharpton, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage. McDonald's has a campaign that celebrates their African-American consumers. Many celebrities have appropriated African-American culture. African-American population centers Fifth Ward, an African-American neighborhood in Houston, Texas African-American neighborhoods are types of ethnic enclaves found in many cities in the United States. The formation of African-American neighborhoods is closely linked to the history of segregation in the United States, either through formal laws, or as a product of social norms. Despite this, African- American neighborhoods have played an important role in the development of nearly all aspects of both African-American culture and broader American culture. =Wealthy African-American communities= Many affluent African- American communities exist today, including the following: Woodmore, Maryland; Hillcrest, Rockland County, New York; Redan and Cascade Heights, Georgia; Mitchellville, Maryland; Missouri City, Texas; Desoto, Texas; Quinby, South Carolina; Forest Park, Oklahoma; Mount Airy, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. =Ghettos= Due to segregated conditions and widespread poverty, some African-American neighborhoods in the United States have been called \\"ghettos\\". The use of this term is controversial and, depending on the context, potentially offensive. Despite mainstream America's use of the term \\"ghetto\\" to signify a poor urban area populated by ethnic minorities, those living in the area often used it to signify something positive. The African- American ghettos did not always contain dilapidated houses and deteriorating projects, nor were all of its residents poverty-stricken. For many African Americans, the ghetto was \\"home\\", a place representing authentic \\"blackness\\" and a feeling, passion, or emotion derived from the rising above the struggle and suffering of being of African descent in America.Smitherman, Geneva. Black Talk: Words and Phrases from the Hood to the Amen Corner. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000. Langston Hughes relays in the \\"Negro Ghetto\\" (1931) and \\"The Heart of Harlem\\" (1945): \\"The buildings in Harlem are brick and stone/And the streets are long and wide,/But Harlem's much more than these alone,/Harlem is what's inside.\\" Playwright August Wilson used the term \\"ghetto\\" in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (1984) and Fences (1987), both of which draw upon the author's experience growing up in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, an African- American ghetto. Kim Pearson Although African-American neighborhoods may suffer from civic disinvestment,\\"Root shock: The consequences of African American dispossession\\" Journal of Urban Health. Springer, New York. Volume 78, Number 1, March 2001. with lower-quality schools, less-effective policingDouglas A. Smith, \\"The Neighborhood Context of Police Behavior\\", Crime and Justice, Vol. 8, Communities and Crime (1986), pp. 313‚Äì341. and fire protection, there are institutions such as churches and museums and political organizations that help to improve the physical and social capital of African- American neighborhoods. In African-American neighborhoods the churches may be important sources of social cohesion.\\"Church Culture as a Strategy of Action in the Black Community\\", Mary Pattillo-McCoy, American Sociological Review, Vol. 63, No. 6 (December 1998), pp. 767‚Äì784. For some African Americans, the kind spirituality learned through these churches works as a protective factor against the corrosive forces of racism.\\"'Gathering the Spirit' at First Baptist Church: Spirituality as a Protective Factor in the Lives of African American Children\\" by Wendy L. Haight; Social Work, Vol. 43, 1998. Museums devoted to African-American history are also found in many African-American neighborhoods. Many African-American neighborhoods are located in inner cities, and these are the mostly residential neighborhoods located closest to the central business district. The built environment is often row houses or brownstones, mixed with older single-family homes that may be converted to multi-family homes. In some areas there are larger apartment buildings. Shotgun houses are an important part of the built environment of some southern African-American neighborhoods. The houses consist of three to five rooms in a row with no hallways. This African-American house design is found in both rural and urban southern areas, mainly in African-American communities and neighborhoods.\\"Black architecture still standing, the Shotgun House\\" ', The Great Buildings Collection on CD-ROM Kevin Matthews. African American Registry. In Black Rednecks and White Liberals, Thomas Sowell suggested that modern urban black ghetto culture is rooted in the white Cracker culture of the North Britons and Scots-Irish who migrated from the generally lawless border regions of Britain to the American South, where they formed a redneck culture common to both blacks and whites in the antebellum South. According to Sowell, characteristics of this culture included lively music and dance, violence, unbridled emotions, flamboyant imagery, illegitimacy, religious oratory marked by strident rhetoric, and a lack of emphasis on education and intellectual interests. Sowell asserts that white liberal Americans have perpetuated this \\"counterproductive and self-destructive lifestyle\\" among black Americans living in urban ghettos through \\"the welfare state, and look- the-other-way policing, and smiling at 'gangsta rap'\\".(edited)Many members of the ghetto are discredited,and falsely misunderstood. Through influence, the members look at for the \\"weak links\\" or those lost to the trap. The aim is to make it out or \\"run the streets\\" See also *African-American newspapers * Civil rights movement (1865‚Äì1896) * Civil rights movement (1896‚Äì1954) * Civil rights movement in popular culture * Commemorations of Benjamin Banneker * Cool (aesthetic) ¬ß African Americans * Culture of the Southern United States * Historically black colleges and universities * Imaging Blackness * Mythology of Benjamin Banneker * National Museum of African American History and Culture *Archives of African American Music and Culture *Culture of Africa References Bibliography * Hamilton, Marybeth: In Search of the Blues. * William Ferris; Give My Poor Heart Ease: Voices of the Mississippi Blues ‚Äì The University of North Carolina Press; (2009) (with CD and DVD) * William Ferris; Glenn Hinson The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Volume 14: Folklife, University of North Carolina Press (2009) (Cover :photo of James Son Thomas) * William Ferris; Blues From The Delta ‚Äì Da Capo Press; revised edition (1988) * Ted Gioia; Delta Blues: The Life and Times of the Mississippi Masters Who Revolutionized American Music ‚Äì W.

It runs just under and has 14 locks. The first lock at Langley Bridge is part of the Cromford Canal. The Erewash Canal as surveyed by J.Smith in 1776 Origins Erewash Aqueduct near Shipley Gate in 2007 The canal obtained its act of parliament in 1777 with John Varley appointed as engineer and John and James Pinkerton the main contractors, it was completed in 1779 at a cost of ¬£21,000 (¬£ in 2015). It was a commercial success from the start mainly transporting coal. The canal's success kept it going far longer than many of its contemporaries in the face of competition from the railways. When the Grand Union Canal Company took over the running of the Erewash in 1932 it was still a going concern. The canal was nationalised in 1947. By this time the closure of feeder canals resulting in a loss of trade and competition from other forms of transport was making itself felt and the last commercial narrowboat delivered its cargo in 1952. In 1962 the British Transport Commission closed the top section of canal. However, it was kept in water to supply the lower half of the canal and it remained navigable. The main line from Long Eaton to Langley Mill was one of seven stretches of canal, formally designated as remainder waterways, which were re-classified by the British Waterways Act of 8 February 1983. Under the act, a total of 82 route miles (132 km) were upgraded to Cruising Waterway Standard.Lewis A. Edwards, (1985), Inland Waterways of Great Britain, 6th Ed, Imray Laurie Norie & Wilson, Shipley Wharf At the turn of the twentieth century Shipley Wharf directly above Shipley Lock was very busy with the transhipment of coal from railway wagons which had descended an incline from the Shipley Collieries to narrowboats on the Erewash Canal. There was also a much earlier wagonway which connected the Shipley collieries to Shipley wharf between the completion of the Erewash Canal in 1779 and the completion of the Nutbrook Canal in 1796, from which point in time the Nutbrook Canal took this traffic. The incline in use at the end of the nineteenth century was originally built to connect the Shipley Collieries, then owned by the Miller-Mundy family with the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley railway line and was operated for this purpose between 1848 and 1870. Problems with the Nutbrook Canal's water supply instigated the re-laying of rails on the incline and its extension under the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley line and under the Midland Railway's Eastwood Colliery branch line, to Shipley Wharf. Coal was loaded into narrowboats here from 1895 until 1942. The sidings at the wharf were laid in a triangle. The coal wagons descended the incline under braking relying on gravity and accumulated momentum to carry them to the sidings where they were connected to an endless rope kept in motion by a stationary steam engine in the centre of the triangle. The endless rope went around three wheels at the corners of the triangle. One was sited on the Erewash Canal's aqueduct which spanned the Erewash River, a second was under the bridge which carried the Eastwood Colliery's branch line over the Shipley line and the third was alongside Eastwood Lock. Using this mechanism the colliery wagons were brought alongside the wharf and could be emptied directly into waiting narrowboats. Eastwood Colliery Eastwood Colliery was situated on a narrow plot of land sandwiched between the Nottingham Canal and the Erewash Canal just above the Erewash Canal's Eastwood Lock. It was originally owned by Doctor Manson but was taken over by Barber Walker and Company. It was served by a branch line from the Great Northern Railway departing the main line close to Newthorpe and Greasley railway station. The colliery was also served by a branch line of the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley line departing the main line at Shipley Gate. Some of the embankments of the two branches are still in existence. The bridge abutments for the Midland Railway's wooden bridge which once stood directly below the Eastwood Lock can still be seen. The colliery was therefore, well served with transport options with the choice of two canals and two railways to export their coal. The Great Northern Railway branch crossed the Nottingham Canal using a swing bridge. The railway swing bridge no longer exists but the pedestrian bridge built next to it is still in use. Excessive water underground brought about the mine's closure in about 1884.  The canal today  * * It starts from the River Trent at Trentlock, then goes through Long Eaton. After Long Eaton it runs roughly parallel to the River Erewash, past Sandiacre and Ilkeston, crossing the Erewash near Eastwood. The canal finally ends at the Langley Mill (Great Northern) basin, where it joins the Nottingham Canal and the Cromford Canal (both currently in a state of abandonment). In 1968 the Erewash Canal Preservation & Development Association (ECP&DA;) was formed in response to a threat by the British Waterways Board to close the canal. One of the ECP&DA;'s achievements was the re-opening of the Great Northern Basin at Langley Mill. This canal basin was the point at which the Cromford, Erewash and Nottingham Canals met. The Langley Mill Boat Company formed in 1974 and based at the Great Northern Basin has cleared and put back into water a short section of the Cromford Canal* connected to the basin. Today the Erewash Canal is fully open and is actively used by pleasure cruisers. At present [2006] the section of canal running through Long Eaton is oft frequented by pleasure craft; the factories which follow the canal along the Northern march of the town are no longer associated with the waterway, and fencing separates them from it. However, these factories only block the western bank of the canal. The towpath, which follows the eastern bank, carries Route 67 of the National Cycle Network between the Lawrence Street access and Stanton Lock where the cycle route diverges to follow the Nutbrook Valley. The canal is also regularly restocked with fish for anglers, and along the eastern tow path dozens of anglers are often seen. Canal vandalism during lockdown On 29 May 2020 the owners of the canal announced that locks along a section of the canal had been clamped open at weekends causing it to empty during the COVID-19 lockdown. The section between Dockholme Lock and Long Eaton Lock was affected. The owners said that the vandalism had killed many fish, left others with breathing problems and washed birds nests away. Derbyshire Police are investigating the vandalism.

Life According to his birth certificate, he was born in N√Æmes in France on 14 August 1842, at 1 am. However, probably due to the midnight birth, Darboux himself usually reported his own birthday as 13 August, e.g. in his filled form for L√©gion d'Honneur. His parents were Fran√ßois Darboux, businessman of mercery, and Alix Gourdoux. The father died when Gaston was 7. His mother undertook the mercery business with great courage, and insisted that her children receive good education. Gaston had a younger brother, Louis, who taught mathematics at the Lyc√©e N√Æmes for almost his entire life. He studied at the N√Æmes Lyc√©e and the Montpellier Lyc√©e before being accepted as the top qualifier at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in 1861, and received his Ph.D. there in 1866. His thesis, written under the direction of Michel Chasles, was titled Sur les surfaces orthogonales. During his studies at the ENS, he also took lectures in Sorbonne University and Coll√®ge de France. Darboux as a student of the Ecole Normale. ca. 1865 In 1870, he co-founded the journal Bulletin des sciences math√©matiques et astronomiques, called \\"Darboux's Journal\\" by his contemporary mathematicians. In 1872, he married the Beauvaisian milliner Am√©lie C√©lina Carbonnier (1848-1911), daughter of Charles Louis Carbonnier, tailor, and Marie Victorine Anastase H√®nocq. He and C√©lina had two children, Jean-Gaston (1870-1921), who was born at the time of the Siege of Paris and later became a marine zoologist at the Faculty of Science in Marseille, and Ana√Øs Berthe Lucie (1873-1970).

The first cartoon he wrote for Warners was The Haunted Mouse (1941) by Tex Avery, then credited as Fred Avery. He first worked mainly for Friz Freleng until 1948, but after that he worked mostly for Chuck Jones, contributing stories to other directors at times, including Robert McKimson. He and Jones collaborated on cartoons like the Academy Award-winning For Scent-imental Reasons (1949), featuring the character Pep√© Le Pew, and the animated public health documentary, So Much for So Little (1949) which won that same year for \\"Best Documentary Short Subject.\\" Maltese was also the voice of the Lou Costello-esque character in Wackiki Wabbit (1943). Some of his earlier works include The Wabbit Who Came to Supper and Fresh Hare, Hare Trigger (which introduced Yosemite Sam), Baseball Bugs for Freleng; Bear Feat, Rabbit of Seville, and Rabbit Fire for Jones. Some of his best-known cartoons are Feed the Kitty, Beep, Beep, Rabbit Seasoning, Don't Give Up the Sheep, Duck Amuck, Bully for Bugs, Bewitched Bunny, From A to Z-Z-Z-Z, and Beanstalk Bunny. These were all directed by Jones. He also worked on One Froggy Evening, the first appearance of future Warner Brothers mascot Michigan J. Frog. Some of his later Warner cartoons included Ali Baba Bunny, Robin Hood Daffy, the seminal What's Opera, Doc? and Duck Dodgers in the 24¬Ωth Century for Jones and Person to Bunny (the final occasion Arthur Q. Bryan voiced Elmer Fudd) and Here Today, Gone Tamale (the only Speedy Gonzales cartoon he ever wrote) for Freleng. Maltese also collaborated with Jones on the 1960s Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts released by MGM. During the years of 1954 and 1955, Maltese also worked at Walter Lantz Productions as writer of some Woody Woodpecker cartoons: Helter Shelter, Witch Crafty (co-written with Homer Brightman), Real Gone Woody, Square Shootin' Square and Bedtime Bedlam. He also is the writer of Chilly Willy's Academy Award-nominated theatrical short The Legend of Rockabye Point, directed by Tex Avery. From 1958 until 1970, he worked at Hanna-Barbera Productions on television cartoons such as The Quick Draw McGraw Show, The Flintstones, The Jetsons, and Wacky Races. Maltese also wrote comic books published by Western Publishing, including for many of the Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera characters whose animated exploits he scripted.

Puppy toy by Eero Aarnio at the Googleplex, 2008 Aarnio studied at the Institute of Industrial Arts in Helsinki, and started his own office in 1962. The following year, he introduced his Ball Chair, a hollow sphere on a stand, open on one side to allow a person to sit within. The similar Bubble Chair was clear and suspended from above. Other innovative designs included his Pastil Chair (a beanbag-like molded armchair), and Tomato Chair (a seat molded between three supporting spheres). His Screw Table, as the name suggests, had the appearance of a flat head screw driven into the ground. He was awarded the American Industrial Design award in 1968. Aarnio's designs were an important aspect of 1960s popular culture, and could often be seen as part of sets in period science-fiction films. Because his designs used very simple geometric forms, they were ideal for such productions. Eero Aarnio continues to create new designs, including toys and furniture for children.

It is located where the outer labia meet, below the pubic mound. The Christina piercing is anatomy dependent; it has a high rejection rate, and is not possible for all women due to anatomical variation. The piercing does not facilitate sexual stimulation and can be found uncomfortable when pressure is applied. It is usually pierced with either a custom-made curved barbell or surface bar to reduce the risk of rejection. The Christina piercing is of contemporary origin. The first known Christina piercing was performed in the 1990s. As is common practice in the piercing industry, it was named after the first recipient of the piercing, a woman named Christina. It is also occasionally referred to by the less commonly used term \\"Venus\\", in reference to its placement at the mons Venus. The piercing usually heals in six to nine months. However, complications may occur depending on jewelry and the pierced person's anatomy. In some cases, it is performed as a surface piercing. Further difficulties can develop due to the relatively long piercing canal and constant movement and friction. Christina piercings may also be susceptible to infection.

As an Isabella piercing intersects the shaft of the clitoris, it is considered to be high risk for nerve damage and is therefore extremely rare. Like other female genital piercings, the Isabella piercing is anatomy-dependent. Nerve damage can result from piercing a clitoris that is too small or from piercing through the shaft of the clitoris and through the dorsal nerve. Piercing through the shaft of the clitoris can also result in excessive bleeding and blood loss to the clitoris. Healing time is 2-3 months.

The name is mostly associated with Arnold von Winkelried, the hero of the Battle of Sempach (1386) in Swiss historiography. Because of the importance of Arnold Winkelried in 19th-century Swiss nationalism, much research has gone into the genealogy of this family. Their origin was presumably in the territory of Ennetmoos in Nidwalden, where a toponym Wichried (Wychried, ) has survived into modern times. The first recorded member of this family was the knight Rudolf von Winkelried, attested in a letter dated to the 1240s. Heinrich von Winkelried was probably a son of Rudolf, als recorded as a knight and ministerialis of count Rudolf von Habsburg, between 1275 and 1303. Heinrich became connected him with a legend of a dragon fight, first recorded by Etterlin (1507). Abbot Rudolf I of Engelberg who lived during the same period may also have been a member of the family. After Heinrich, the Winkelrieds lose their distinction as noblemen. People bearing the name Winkelried are recorded as mostly prosperous commoners during the 14th and 15th centuries. These later Winkelrieds may reflect their origin among the nobility by keeping a coat of arms (displaying a crescent in a triangle). A Jacob von Winkelried is recorded in 1343 as owning property in Ennetmoos, in 1372 a Peter Winkelried is the tenant of the possessions of Engelberg in Alpnach. In the 1382 uprising against the noble families in Unterwalden, the Winkelrieds seem to be affected because of their close connections to the aristocracy. In a document dated 1 May 1367, one of the witnesses signs as Erni Winkelried. This is the only candidate on record for the historicity of Arnold Winkelried of patriotic legend. The first mention of Winkelried as the hero of Sempach dates to nearly a century later, in the time of the Burgundian Wars. But a man called Erni Winkelried is recorded again on 29 September 1389 and on 13 March 1396, after the battle where he supposedly died a hero's death. But yet another Erni Winkelried appears in 1417 and 1418 as amtmann of Nidwalden, so that there was clearly more than one person with this name, perhaps father and son. Yet another Arnold Winkelried is recorded in the second half of the 15th century, in connection of a lawsuit of November 1474 and as delegate of Nidwalden at the Swiss Diet on several occasions during 1476 to 1482. A Heinrich Winkelried recorded from 1456 was a member of the council of Nidwalden from before 1471 and delegate at the Diet during 1469 to 1498. A fourth Arnold Winkelried is recorded as delegate from 1496 to 1507. He was also a member of a Swiss delegation sent to emperor Maximilian in 1508 and as a captain in the battle of Novara in 1513. This Arnold is last recorded in 1524. Yet another Arnold Winkelried, sometimes conflated with the aforementioned, was a notorious mercenary leader during the first quarter of the 16th century. He was knighted in 1514 by the Milanese duke Maximilian Sforza. On 13 September he was instigated by cardinal Schiner to engage in a skirmish with the French men-at-arms outside of Milano, thus causing the disastrous Battle of Marignano. In 1516 he marched against Milano in the Service of Maximilian, and defended Verona against the French. After the treaty of May 1517, Winkelried threatened to declare war on the king of France (who now also was the duke of Milan) privately because of the unpaid wages still owed by Sforza, the previous duke. After this dispute had been settled to his satisfaction, he entered French service in 1518 and participated in the 1521 campaign in Picardy in the rank of captain. In 1522, he commanded 16,000 Swiss mercenaries in French service invading Lombardy. At Bicocca he met with his former commander Georg von Frundsberg, who served on the imperial side. The two mercenary leaders engaged in single combat, and Winkelried was killed. It was later disputed among the Swiss serving on either side whether Winkelried had been killed by Frundsberg or whether he had been shot from the flank. Because the death of this Arnold Winkelried immediately predates the earliest printed references to the legendary hero of Sempach, some historians have suggested that the chroniclers of the early 16th century named the previously unnamed hero after the mercenary leader.so Charles Oman in A History of the Art of War in the Sixteenth Century' (1937). A son of Arnold's, Hans Winkelreid, died before 1532, and the name seems to have been extinct by 1550. References *Wilhelm Oechsli, ' Winkelried' in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, ed.

It is native to southern Europe (but adventive in more northern countries of Europe), north Africa and southwest Asia, where it is found on neglected, damp patches of land. The specific epithet damascena relates to Damascus in Syria. The plant's common name comes from the flower being nestled in a ring of multifid, lacy bracts. Description It grows to tall, with pinnately divided, thread-like, alternate leaves. The flowers, blooming in early summer, are most commonly different shades of blue, but can be white, pink, or pale purple, with 5 to 25 sepals. The actual petals are located at the base of the stamens and are minute and clawed. The sepals are the only colored part of the perianth. The four to five carpels of the compound pistil have each an erect style. The fruit is a large and inflated capsule, growing from a compound ovary, and is composed of several united follicles, each containing numerous seeds. This is rather exceptional for a member of the buttercup family. The capsule becomes brown in late summer. The plant self- seeds, growing on the same spot year after year.

It is part of the atoll North Danger Reef, and just southwest of Northeast Cay. With an area of , it is the sixth largest of the naturally occurring Spratly Islands, and the second largest of the Vietnamese-occupied islands. Southwest Cay has the archipelago's highest point, at 4 meters above sea level. It was once a breeding place for birds, and was covered with trees and guano; export of guano had been carried out \\"on a considerable scale\\". The island is also claimed by China (PRC), Taiwan (ROC), and the Philippines. History =1933 - French possession= In 1933, the French Government took possession of the Spratly Islands including Southwest Cay and Northeast Cay. Three ships, the Alerte, the Astrolabe and the De Lanessan took part in the expedition. The following quotations are from an account given by H. Cucherousset in L'Eveil economique de l'Indochine (No. 790 of May 28, 1933): :\\"Further north still, at the level of Nha Trang, is the atoll named \\"North Danger\\", the Alerte took possession of two sandy islands (cayes) where it found some Japanese fishing. The De Lanessan went there too and explored the little island. The latter is perceptibly higher than the others, the highest point reaching 5 metres. The phosphate beds are considerable and were much exploited by the Japanese.\\" After possession had been taken, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs published the following notice in the French Journal Officiel dated 26 July 1933 (page 7837): :\\"Notice concerning the occupation of certain islands by French naval units. :The French government has caused the under mentioned isles and islets to be occupied by French naval units: :Group of two islands situated at latitude 111¬∞29' north and longitude 114¬∞21' east of Greenwich, with their dependent isles (36) (Possession taken April 10, 1933). :The above-mentioned isles and islets henceforward come under French sovereignty (this notice cancels the previous notice inserted in the Official Journal dated July 25, 1933, page 7784).\\" =1939-1945 - Japanese occupation= In 1939, Japan occupied the islands and remained there until the end of World War II. =1956 - Transfer to South Vietnam= Territorial monument (stele).The stele was used from 22 August 1956 until 1975, when it was replaced by another one from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (successor state after the Fall of Saigon) In 1956, France transferred the islands to South Vietnam. In 1959, the South Vietnamese Government renamed the Song T·ª≠ islands (meaning twins after their resemblance to each other) \\"T√¢y\\" (meaning West) and \\"ƒê√¥ng\\" (meaning East) respectively. They were annexed to Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province, South Vietnam. In 1961, the two South Vietnam Navy cruisers, the Van Kiep and the Van Don, landed on the islands of Song T·ª≠ T√¢y (Southwest Cay). On May 24, 1963, the sovereignty steles were rebuilt on Song T·ª≠ ƒê√¥ng (Northeast Cay) and Song T·ª≠ T√¢y (Southwest Cay) by crew members of the three vessels Huong Giang, Chi Lang and Ky Hoa of South Vietnam. =1968 - Philippines occupation= In 1968, Filipino troops occupied Song T·ª≠ ƒê√¥ng (Northeast Cay, Parola) and Song T·ª≠ T√¢y (Southwest Cay, Pugad).https://amti.csis.org/northeast-cay/ \\"As this relates to Cloma, no official act by the Philippine government could be found which contemporaneously and specifically ratified his declaration. However, in 1968 the Philippine government began sending troops to occupy the area and in 1971 made an official announcement that the Philippines were occupying several of the features in KIG for ‚Äúreasons of national security and to ‚Äúprotect the interests of the state and its citizens.‚Äù https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/iop-2014-U-008435.pdf, page 27, paragraph 3 =1975 - Capture by South Vietnam= In 1975, a party was held for the Filipino commanding officer at Northeast Cay. Filipino forces guarding the Southwest Cay attended the party and upon their return, found that the South Vietnamese, who were then allies, had occupied the island in their absence. Southwest Cay is near the northern edge of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. It is just northwest of Dangerous Ground in the North Danger Reef group, which also contains the Filipino-occupied Northeast Cay (Parola), the South Vietnamese-occupied South Reef, and the unoccupied North Reef. Southwest Cay and Northeast Cay are just 1.75 miles (2.82 km) apart, and each island is visible from the other. The incident took place when all the Filipino soldiers guarding Southwest Cay (Pugad) left to attend to the birthday party of their commanding officer who was based on Northeast Cay (Parola). A storm that day is also believed to have influenced the soldiers to regroup temporarily on Parola. A report also came out saying that South Vietnamese officials managed to send prostitutes to the birthday party to lure the Filipino soldiers guarding Pugad. It was said to be a \\"present\\" to the Filipino commander for his birthday, and as a move of South Vietnamese forces to befriend all Filipino soldiers guarding the Spratlys. Filipino soldiers did not expect that South Vietnam would resort to foul play since both the Philippines and South Vietnam, together with the United States, were allies in the Vietnam War. This tactic is believed to be the reason why South Vietnamese forces knew that the Filipino soldiers left the island, an action that is usually kept confidential. After the party and after the weather cleared out, the returning soldiers were surprised that a company of South Vietnamese soldiers were already on the island. The South Vietnamese flag replaced the Filipino flag flying on the pole erected by Filipino soldiers. The Filipino soldiers returned to Parola immediately for fear that Parola would be the next target. After higher-ups of the Philippines were informed about the situation, they instructed the troops based in Parola and Pagasa (Thitu Island) to stay on red alert status. For the following mornings, the only thing the Filipino soldiers could do on Parola was to \\"curse\\" while South Vietnamese soldiers on Pugad sang their national anthem. Malaca√±ang officials, who did not want to compromise the alliance while the Vietnam War was still being fought, decided to remain silent. =1975 - Vietnam reunification= A few months later, the recently unified Vietnam (after North Vietnam won over South Vietnam, the North Vietnam task force occupied the island) decided to remove all remaining South Vietnamese troops in the Spratly Islands and establish military control among the features. It was reported that dozens of South Vietnamese soldiers in Southwest Cay (Song T·ª≠ T√¢y) swam all the way to Northeast Cay (Parola) just to avoid being captured by North Vietnamese forces. It was then when Malaca√±ang officials, headed by President Ferdinand Marcos, discussed how the Philippines would reclaim the island. It had been apparent that most of the officials, who considered the North Vietnamese communists to be a threat to Filipino national security, wanted to attack Southwest Cay (Pugad) to reclaim it. However, after an intelligence report came stating that the unified Vietnam had already built a huge concrete garrison within a few weeks, the officials dropped the plan and tried to resolve the issue diplomatically. However, this approach eventually died along the process making Southwest Cay (Song T·ª≠ T√¢y) a Vietnamese-occupied island up to this day. This incident was confirmed in interviews with soldiers involved in an episode of the defunct Magandang Gabi, Bayan of ABS-CBN. Although Vietnam, China (PRC), Taiwan (ROC), and the Philippines all claim the island, no clashes have been reported since 1975.

Although it never entered service, its research pointed the way toward the later General Dynamics F-111 and Grumman's own F-14 Tomcat. Design and development The Navy's interest in the variable-geometry wing was based on concerns that the ever-increasing weight of its jet fighters was making aircraft carrier operations troublesome. Many of its existing aircraft already had marginal carrier performance, and the trend in weight growth was obviously upward. At the same time, the demands for high-speed performance demanded swept wing layouts that did not lend themselves to good takeoff characteristics. The prospect of combining the two in a single aircraft was enticing. Originally conceived as a swept-wing version of the earlier F9F Panther, in February‚ÄìMarch 1948, the design was reconfigured with a T-tail and ultimately a variable-geometry wing.Winchester 2005, p. 294. It featured a T-tail, with the horizontal stabilator, a small pivoting center body with a delta servo control at the nose and a larger rear delta main wing, mounted atop the vertical fin. The single turbojet engine was fed by cheek intakes. The high, shoulder-mounted wing could be moved to two positions: a 13.5¬∞ sweep for takeoff and landing and a 42.5¬∞ sweep for high-speed flight. The unique horizontal stabilizer design was free-floating; the attached small foreplane was directly controlled by the pilot and pulled the stabilizer up or down; so, it was aerodynamically, not mechanically controlled, and this resulted in sluggish pitch control, increasingly so at low speeds where airflow over the small foreplane was lessened, and if the project had developed further, it probably would have been replaced by a conventional all-flying tailplane. The unpredictable behavior of the design often caused pilot-induced oscillations, with the sudden and erratic deployment of leading edge slats causing the aircraft to be nearly uncontrollable much of the time.DeMeis 1976, p. 32. The XF10F-1 was not armed, but production aircraft would likely have had four 20 mm (.79 in) cannon and pylons for bombs and rockets, like other contemporary Navy fighters. Testing XF10F Jaguar The Jaguar's configuration presented many of the same handling problems as the earlier Bell X-5 experimental aircraft, with some vicious spin characteristics. The Jaguar's development was hampered by its use of the chronically unreliable Westinghouse J40 turbojet, which, as on other aircraft of this period, made the Jaguar dangerously underpowered and prone to various engine-related problems. The J40 developed only 6,800 lbf (30.2 kN) thrust rather than the anticipated 11,000 lbf (49 kN), and its troubles ultimately proved to be insurmountable.Winchester 2005, p. 295. Test pilot Corwin \\"Corky\\" Meyer, the only pilot to fly the Jaguar,DeMeis 1976, p. 46. described it as entertaining to fly \\"because there was so much wrong with it.\\"Air International, VG Special Issue, 1977. Examples of the \\"wrongness\\" encountered by Meyer during the test flight program included: *Jamming of the wing sweep mechanism as hydraulic fluid congealed into a gelatinous state from poor maintenance, resulting in a substance with \\"a consistency of Jell-O\\". Despite this failure, the aerodynamicist's assertion that the wing would unsweep itself in case of a mechanical failure proved entirely correct, to Meyer's relief. *Regular inflight failures of the equally experimental Westinghouse XJ-40 turbojet. The reason for its unreliability within the Jaguar was traced ultimately to an extraordinary case of sloppy manufacture; an engine electronics box access panel had a screw nearly 5 in (127 mm) long mangling the delicate circuits within, in sharp contrast to the other three panel screws which were barely .4 in (10 mm) long. *The \\"aerodynamically balanced\\" canard-actuated pendulum elevator, whose ineffectiveness and poor contribution to stability was already apparent in free-flight development models. The instability was dismissed as a \\"model effect\\", but this proved to be a fallacious judgement. Initial fixes consisted of a set of triangular horizontal fins on the rear fuselage, but ultimately Grumman admitted defeat and retroactively fitted the horizontal surfaces from the earlier Grumman F-9 Cougar swept-wing fighter. By this time the program was nearing its end, and it was at this stage unlikely that the U.S. Navy would adopt the Jaguar. *During a flight the canopy opened and could not be closed, nor could it be ejected. At the same time, the less-than-trustworthy engine began losing power at an alarming rate, but, due to the problems with the canopy, Corky Meyer could not eject. He did manage to land safely. It was just after this flight that the aforementioned grossly oversized screw was found. He found the translating wing-sweep mechanism, similar to the Bell X-5's, (which was much more complicated than the one later adopted by the F-111, F-14 and Panavia Tornado et al.), to be the only feature that worked flawlessly. The Navy was not encouraged by the results, and the development of larger carriers with angled flight decks and steam-driven catapults made the swing-wing configuration unnecessary. The prototype XF10F-1 first flew on 19 May 1952. It was used for some 32 test flights throughout the year, but in April 1953, the Navy canceled the program, and with it, the 112 production aircraft that had been ordered. The sole flying aircraft and the uncompleted second prototype were shipped to Naval Air Material Center in Philadelphia for barricade testing, and the static test aircraft was later used as a gunnery target.

Pulicat Lagoon is considered to be the second largest brackish water body in India measuring . The Lagoon is one of the three important wetlands to attract North-East Monsoon rain clouds during October to December season to Tirupati Region. The lagoon comprises the following regions, which adds up according to Andhra Pradesh Forest Department: 1) Pulicat Lake (Tamil Nadu-TN & Andhra Pradesh-AP) 2) Marshy/Wetland Land Region (AP) 3) Venadu Reserve Forest (AP) 4) Pernadu Reserve Forest (AP) The lagoon was cut across in the middle by the Sriharikota Link Road, which divided the water body into lagoon and marshy land. The lagoon encompasses the Pulicat lagoon Bird Sanctuary. The barrier island of Sriharikota separates the lagoon from the Bay of Bengal and is home to the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. Major part of the lagoon comes under Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. History c. 1602 In the first century, the anonymous mariner who wrote Periplus of the Erythraean Sea listed Podouke (Pulicat) as one of the three ports on the east coast of India. In the second century, Ptolemy's list of ports on this coast included Podouke Emporion. In the 13th century, Arabs migrated to the shores of the lagoon after they were banished from Mecca for refusing to pay tributes to a new caliph. Streets with dilapidated masonry houses once occupied by these Arabian Muslims are still found in the area and resident families claim records in Arabic testifying the migration. Portuguese colonized the lagoon in 16th century followed by the Dutch. The Dutch drifted to the lagoon as their ships got stuck on the shores of Karimanal village on the opposite side of the mouth of the lagoon. During the Dutch occupation, Pulicat was known by the name Pallaicatta. Fort Geldria dating to 1609, a church, a cemetery with tombs and mausoleums constructed by the Dutch are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The Dutch transacted business with the British East India Company and other countries in the region. A scientific study of the palynological characteristics of the lagoon was conducted by taking sedimentary soil samples from four test pits. It shows that the vegetational reconstruction from peat beds at a.m.s.l. and (a.m.s.l.) in the west at Sullurpeta and Kasdredinilem, respectively, is indicative of a palaeoshoreline. The sea level reached its maximum around 6650 plus or minus 110 yrs BP in Sullurpeta, west from the present shoreline. The radiocarbon dates of peat bed at Kasdreddinilem reveals an age of 4608 plus or minus 122 yrs BP, indicating the shift in mangrove line eastwards during the regressive phase. Geography and topography Pulicat Lake map 2016 The lagoon's boundary limits range between 13.33¬∞ to 13.66¬∞ N and 80.23¬∞ to 80.25¬∞E, with a dried part of the lagoon extending up to 14.0¬∞N.; with about 96% of the lagoon in Andhra Pradesh and 3% in Tamil Nadu. The lagoon is aligned parallel to the coast line with its western and eastern parts covered with sand ridges. Area of the lagoon varies with the tide; in high tide and in low tide. Its length is about with width varying from to . Climate of the lagoon coast line is dominated by tropical monsoons. Air temperature varies from to . The large spindle-shaped barrier island named Sriharikota separates the lagoon from the Bay of Bengal. The sandy barrier islands of Irkam and Venad and smaller islands in the north are aligned north-south and divide the lagoon into eastern and western sectors. The morphology of the lagoons is categorized under four types with large areas under mudflats and sandflats. The fishing village of Pulicat is at the south end of the lake. The Satish Dhawan Space Center is located on the north end of the island. Pulicat, DugarƒÅjupatnam and Sullurpeta are villages located on the periphery of the lagoon. Hydrology Two rivers which feed the lagoon are the Arani River at the southern tip and the Kalangi River from the northwest, in addition to some smaller streams. The Buckingham Canal, a navigation channel, is part of the lagoon on its western side. The lagoon's water exchange with the Bay of Bengal is through an inlet channel at the north end of Sriharikota and out flow channel of about width at its southern end, both of which carry flows only during the rainy season. The lagoon acts as buffer to retain the accumulated flood water till the flood water is discharged gradually to the sea during the monsoon period and cyclones. The lagoon and its river basins are located both in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states. The lagoon and its drainage river basins become interstate river basin as per Interstate River Water Disputes Act 1956. Most of the lagoon area including its water outlet to the sea is located in Andhra Pradesh. Pulicat Lake flooded due to rains The water quality of the lagoon varies widely during various seasons - summer, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post- monsoon - as the depth and width of the lagoon mouth varies causing a dynamic situation of mixing and circulation of waters. The resultant salinity variation and DO (dissolved oxygen) affects the primary production, plankton, biodiversity and fisheries in this lagoon. Salinity values vary from zero during the monsoon to about 52,000 ppm (hyper saline) during post and pre- monsoon seasons. Adjustment to this wide variation is difficult for sessile and sedentary species in the lagoon. However, euryhaline species still dwell in the lagoon. The benthic or the bottom habitat of this lagoon is classified into three zones. The southern zone, the first zone, is dominated by sand with some admixture of mud. The second zone at the northern region is wholly muddy. The third zone with sand and mud in equal parts is overgrown with patches of weeds and is reported to be rich in benthic biodiversity. Toxicity levels of heavy metals such as magnesium, lead, zinc, nickel, cadmium, aluminum and copper and chemicals such as ammonia, sulphate and fluoride in the lagoon are well within permissible limits. Recently, the lagoon likely experienced up to 40% desalination due to the impact of freshwater floods from the 2015 South India floods Flora and fauna The lagoon has rich flora and fauna diversity, which supports active commercial fisheries and a large and varied bird population. =Limnology= Fishing is the major occupation in the many villages located around the lagoon periphery and on the islands. The lagoon has rich fish diversity, mostly marine species, some truly brackish water and a few freshwater species. Mullets and catfish are the major brackish water fish, which have supported sustenance fishing for the lagoon fishermen. The lagoon is a nursery for several species of fish. Two thirds of the settlements in the lagoon area are in Tamil Nadu and the balance in Andhra Pradesh. 12,370 fishermen live on full-time fishery in the lagoon (6,000 in Andhra Pradesh and 6,370 in Tamil Nadu). An average 1200 tonnes of fish and crustaceans are harvested annually, of which prawns constitute 60%, followed by mullets. Seafood exports of white and tiger prawns, jellyfish, finfish and live lagoon green crabs are also economic benefits from the lagoon. 168 total fish species are reported. The frequently found ones are the mullets: M. cunnesius, M. jerdoni, M. dussumieri, M. cephalus, M. bornensis and blowfish T. nigropunctatus, T. leopardus, Barbus dorsalis, catfish Macrones vittatus, sardines, Sardinella fimbriata and milk fish. Finfish, green crabs, clams and prawns are the most commercially exploited fishes of the lagoon. Endangered green sea turtles are found on the beaches of Sriharikota beach. Salt is also produced from the lagoon. =Avifauna= Spot-billed pelican at Pulicat Lake The shallow lagoon is known for its diversity of aquatic birds and is an important stopover on migration routes and is reported to be the third most important wetland on the eastern coast of India for migratory shorebirds, particularly during the spring and autumn migration seasons. In view of the rich avifauna of the lagoon, two bird sanctuaries are established in the lagoon, one in each of the two states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The Andhra Pradesh portion of Pulicat lagoon Bird Sanctuary, established in September 1976, has an area of within the lagoon's total area in the state in the Tada Taluk of Nellore district. The Wildlife Division of the state has listed 115 species of water and land birds in the sanctuary. Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary is also located nearby in its catchment area. The Tamil Nadu part of the lagoon of area, extending over the Ponneri and Gummidipundi taluks of Thiruvallur district was declared a bird sanctuary in October 1980. Every year approximately 15,000 greater flamingos are reported to visit the lagoon along with pelicans, kingfishers, herons, painted storks, spoonbills and ducks. The highest concentrations of flamingo are found in the periphery of the lagoon where the water level is below. The concentrations of flamingos are also associated with high algal, fish and benthic diversity.Ramesh, D.A., Ramachandran, S. (2005) Factors influencing flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) distribution in the Pulicat Lagoon ecosystem, India. Wetlands Ecology and Management 13 (1):69-72 Other water birds in the area include spot-billed pelican, seven species of herons and egrets, painted stork, greater flamingos, ducks, 20 species of shorebirds, gulls, terns, little grebe, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, Asian openbill stork, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, lesser whistling teal, Indian spot-billed duck, great thick-knee and stone curlew. Several species of wintering waterfowl have been noted including bar- headed goose, ruddy shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, common teal, northern pintail, garganey, northern shoveller, common pochard, brown-headed gull, black-headed gull, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern and Caspian tern. Birds of prey which appear in winter are the: white-bellied sea eagle, harriers and peregrine falcons. The largest concentrations of flamingos occur in the Andhra Pradesh part of the sanctuary, around the islands of Vendadu and Irukkam. =Aquatic vegetation= Aquatic vegetation reported are 59 species, including eight Cyanophyceae, seven Chlorphyceae and two Rhodophyceae. Patches of residual, dry, evergreen forest and large areas of littoral scrub in woodlands in fishing villages bordering the lagoon are seen. Invasive phytoplankton species of Prosopis juliflora, Spirulina major, Oscillatoria spp., Anabaena spp., Rhizosolenia castracanei, Eucampia cornuta and Climacodium frauenfeldianum in the plains on the periphery of the lake have been recorded. Threats and issues Due to the Climate change and delay in the North East Monsoons are quit often in every year, lack of dredging activities in the estuaries region like Duggarajapatanam, Mulapadava and Tupilipalem. Diversity of lake look like an semi salt Aral Desert, It is directly impact the wild life conversation in those area and lively hoods of coastal Community people whom are depended on the lake. Evidence of these changes were inevitable, Birds migrations has been decreased rapidly due to lack of maintains in the Lake beds. Its effects the almost 160 Sq. km area of the lake. Almost 40 % of the lake is dried up until by 2020. Recent trends and data shows pullicat lake is in the verge of destruction due to the lack of dredging activities. If same trends continuous it would be like another Areal sea. In the Andhra Pradesh part of the lagoon, several threats to the lagoon have been identified. These are: pollution from sewage, pesticides, agricultural chemicals and industrial effluents from Arani and Kalangi rivers draining into the lagoon bringing fertilizers and pesticides with the runoff from the agricultural field into the drainage basin; domestic sewage; effluents and wastes from numerous fish-processing units; oil spills from the mechanized boats. Release of of marine chemicals, and salt-manufacturing industry and shrimp farming in more than on the eastern part of the lagoon, have affected the Pulicat Bird Sanctuary; the livelihood of 30,000 fishermen and 20,000 agricultural labourers (for whom fishing is an off-season economic activity) have also been disturbed. This activity is also reported to have serious impact on aquaculture development. Siltation and periodic closure of the bar mouth due to the dynamic process of sediment transport has caused reduction of size and seasonal closure of the mouth of the lagoon. It has reduced fresh sea-water exchange and made the lagoon shallow and turbid. It is reported that average depth, in the early 20th century, has been reduced to less than in the lagoon. This has caused difficulties such as the bar mouth getting silted up and being closed during the summer season (June-July to Oct-Nov), and an increase in flood levels during the rainy season. The lagoon acts as a large evaporating basin when the bar is closed resulting in salinity levels remaining low or high subject to the flood discharge into the lagoon during the north east monsoon. Fluctuation of water levels in the lagoon (above or below the sea level) is affecting flora, fauna and fisheries; siltation has caused variation of the lagoon mouth resulting in reduction of tidal inflows and consequent decline in stocking of commercially important species of prawns and mullets. The flood plains reclamation in Arani River basin for industrial and residential purposes is also increasing lagoon maximum water level during the floods. Runoff from agricultural fields in the drainage basins of the Arani and Kalangi rivers into the lagoon has increased pollution load from fertilizers and pesticides; pollution from domestic sewage is also being released to the lagoon. A petrochemical complex, power plant and a satellite port on Ennore creek have further aggravated the problem; there is threat of flooding of 14 island - villages of the lagoon; subsequent to the tsunami in 2004, the number of fishing boats have increased resulting in the \\"Catch Per Unit Effort\\" of fish, prawns and crabs declined from 1000 tonnes to about 700 tonnes; and this has increased the social and fishing rights conflicts between marine based fishermen and the lagoon fishermen. Due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, lagoon fishery was adversely affected, with many fishing communities losing all means of livelihood until the middle of April 2005, as the loss of lives, homes and boats prevented them from going fishing in the sea and the lagoon. They subsisted on relief supplies provided by the government and other agencies. Many people in fish related trades were also affected. However, a beneficial effect of the tsunami has been the widening of the opening to the lagoon. Restoration and social activities Various groups and non governmental organizations are active in the area. The AARDE Foundation maintains Pulicat Museum at Pazhaverkadu to create awareness among inhabitants and city dwellers. AARDE Foundation represented Pulicat at United Nation's World Urban Forum and HABITAT-III as an associate-partner. Pulicat Day, part of RAMSAR's World Wetlands Day, is celebrated every February by AARDE to bring attention to this fragile environment. An expert plan on \\"Wildlife Action Plan for Conservation Measures on the Pulicat lagoon Sanctuary\\" has envisaged to set up a hydro biological research station, visitor center, provide shallow- bottomed boats to enable sanctuary staff to patrol the lagoon and to prepare a management plan and conservation strategy for the entire area. COPDANET is striving to implement traditional \\"Paadu system\\" and regular desilting to ensure adequate salt and fresh water mix in the lagoon which could enhance fish resources. Centre for Research on New International Economic Order (CReNIEO) has been promoting welfare of fishermen and management of the natural resources of the lagoon. A research study by Loyola College, Chennai reported in 2007 that the lagoon that bore the brunt of industrial pollution has made an ecological turnaround, recording toxicity levels well within permissible limits. Under the \\"Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project\\" (TEAP), construction of a high level bridge across Pulicat lagoon along with approach roads on both sides of the lagoon has been constructed providing a safe escape route for people residing on the islands and also access for emergency response operations. The southern part of the lagoon in Tamil Nadu from the estuary is rich in fishes and the fishing is controlled by a traditional Paadu system. Paadu is a traditional system of getting entitlements to eligible members of a particular community for undertaking specified fishing activity in certain designated areas. The fishing grounds fall within a radius of from the mouth of the lagoon with a salinity well maintained without much drying even during low tides. However, this traditional practice is based on caste control of the access rights to the high productive areas and is opposed by eastern fishermen and ocean-side villages. As a result, conflicts leading to violence have been reported. Transportation The Tamil Nadu part of the lagoon is north of Chennai and the nearest airport and major railway station are in Chennai. The nearest suburban railway station is at Ponneri. To reach Pulicat on the National Highway 16 from Chennai, drive north toward Nellore, after , turn right towards Ponneri village and continue to Pulicat village. Sullurpeta station is from Sriharikota. The Buckingham Canal on the western side of the lagoon is the navigation route through the lagoon used by cargo and passenger vessels.

The novella was published in 1889, and was promptly censored by the Russian authorities. The work is an argument for the ideal of sexual abstinence and an in-depth first-person description of jealous rage. The main character, Pozdnyshev, relates the events leading up to his killing of his wife: in his analysis, the root causes for the deed were the \\"animal excesses\\" and \\"swinish connection\\" governing the relation between the sexes. Summary Tolstoy's novella inspired the 1901 painting Kreutzer Sonata by Ren√©-Xavier Prinet During a train ride, Pozdnyshev overhears a conversation concerning marriage, divorce and love. When a woman argues that marriage should not be arranged but based on true love, he asks \\"what is love?\\" and points out that, if understood as an exclusive preference for one person, it often passes quickly. Convention dictates that two married people stay together, and initial love can quickly turn into hatred. He then relates how he used to visit prostitutes when he was young, and complains that women's dresses are designed to arouse men's desires. He further states that women will never enjoy equal rights to men as long as men view them as objects of desire, yet describes their situation as a form of power over men, mentioning how much of society is geared towards their pleasure and well-being and how much sway they have over men's actions. After he meets and marries his wife, periods of passionate love and vicious fights alternate. She bears five children, and then receives contraceptives: \\"The last excuse for our swinish life ‚Äì children ‚Äì was then taken away, and life became viler than ever.\\" His wife takes a liking to a violinist, Troukhatchevsky, and the two perform Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata (Sonata No. 9 in A Major for piano and violin, Op. 47) together. Pozdnyshev complains that some music is powerful enough to change one's internal state to a foreign one. He hides his raging jealousy and goes on a trip, returns early, finds Troukhatchevsky and his wife together and kills his wife with a dagger. The violinist escapes: \\"I wanted to run after him, but remembered that it is ridiculous to run after one's wife's lover in one's socks; and I did not wish to be ridiculous but terrible.\\" Later acquitted of murder in light of his wife's apparent adultery, Pozdnyshev rides the train and tells his story to a fellow passenger, the narrator. Censorship After the work had been forbidden in Russia by the censors, a mimeographed version was widely circulated. In 1890, the United States Post Office Department prohibited the mailing of newspapers containing serialized installments of The Kreutzer Sonata. This was confirmed by the U.S. Attorney General in the same year. Theodore Roosevelt called Tolstoy a \\"sexual moral pervert.\\"The Everything Theodore Roosevelt Book: The extraordinary life of an American icon, Arthur G Sharp, MA The ban on its sale was struck down in New York and Pennsylvania courts in 1890.\\"Count Tolstoi Not Obscene\\", The New York Times, September 25, 1890\\"'Kreutzer Sonata' in Court\\", The New York Times, August 8, 1890 Epilogue In the Epilogue To The Kreutzer Sonata, published in 1890, Tolstoy clarifies the intended message of the novella, writing: Countering the argument that widespread abstinence would lead to a cessation of the human race, he describes chastity as an ideal that provides guidance and direction, not as a firm rule. Writing from a position of deep religiosity (that he had explained in his Confession in 1882), he points out that not Christ, but the Church (which he despises) instituted marriage. \\"The Christian's ideal is love of God and his neighbor, self-renunciation in order to serve God and his neighbour; carnal love, marriage, means serving oneself, and therefore is, in any case, a hindrance in the service of God and men\\". During the international celebration of Tolstoy's 80th birthday in 1908, G. K. Chesterton criticized this aspect of Tolstoy's thought in an article in the 19 September issue of Illustrated London News: \\"Tolstoy is not content with pitying humanity for its pains: such as poverty and prisons. He also pities humanity for its pleasures, such as music and patriotism. He weeps at the thought of hatred; but in The Kreutzer Sonata he weeps almost as much at the thought of love. He and all the humanitarians pity the joys of men.\\" He went on to address Tolstoy directly: \\"What you dislike is being a man. You are at least next door to hating humanity, for you pity humanity because it is human.\\" Adaptations =Plays= The Kreutzer Sonata, directed by Harrison Grey Fiske premiered at the Lyric Theatre in New York on 10 September 1906.

Biography  Achinstein is the son of Betty (n√©e Comras) and economist Asher Achinstein. He received his B.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard with a dissertation on Carnap's theory of probability. It was the German philosopher Carl G. Hempel, in a visit to Harvard in 1953‚Äì4 (replacing W.V. Quine who was on leave), who motivated him to pursue Philosophy of Science. Upon getting a Harvard Traveling Fellowship, Achinstein spent a year in Oxford in 1959 working under the guidance of P. F. Strawson. In Oxford he attended seminars and lectures delivered by Gilbert Ryle, A.J. Ayer, and J.L. Austin. Achinstein specializes in philosophy of science with strong interests in the history of science. Achinstein has taught for many years at Johns Hopkins University, where he is currently Professor of Philosophy. In Spring 2009, Achinstein began teaching at Yeshiva University as the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein University Professor of Philosophy and is the founder and director of the Center for History and Philosophy of Science of Yeshiva University, New York. He returned to Johns Hopkins in Spring 2011. He has held Guggenheim, NEH, and NSF fellowships, and has served as a visiting professor at MIT, Stanford, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is the author of seven influential books in the history and philosophy of science. Among them are Particles and Waves, which shared the prestigious Lakatos Award in 1993. This book is a study of methodological problems arising from three episodes in 19th century physics: the wave-particle debate about light, the development of the kinetic-molecular theory, and the discovery of the electron. In 2001, Achinstein published The Book of Evidence, a philosophical and historical study of various concepts of evidence employed in the sciences. A volume of his important collected essays over the years, Evidence, Explanation, and Realism, was published in the spring of 2010. A special volume honoring him, Philosophy of Science Matters: The Philosophy of Peter Achinstein, was published in 2011. In 2013, Achinstein published Evidence and Method: Scientific Strategies of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The book Speculation: Within and About Science, appeared in 2018. Three of his published papers have been selected for \\"Philosopher's Annual,\\" the best 10 philosophy papers published that year. He has three children, Jonathan, Sharon, and Betty. His daughter, Sharon Achinstein, is the Sir William Osler Professor of English at The Johns Hopkins University.

Education Chambers attended Quarry Bank Comprehensive School sixth form in Liverpool. From 18, he studied composition and piano at the Guildhall School of Music, London. Career Chambers joined World Party in 1986. He co-wrote 'Love Street' with Karl Wallinger on the band's album: Bang!. He appeared on The Mission's album Carved in Sand, providing the orchestral arrangement and piano for the song \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", and was producer for the short-lived group Stress with their debut album. In 1992, Chambers formed his own band The Lemon Trees and wrote, produced and performed with them until they disbanded in 1995. The band only released one album - Open Book. Following the end of The Lemon Trees, Chambers wrote with Cathy Dennis on Am I the Kinda Girl? and other albums before meeting Robbie Williams in January 1997. Their first work together, Life thru a Lens, was released in September 1997. In the next five years, they produced four other albums: I've Been Expecting You, Sing When You're Winning, Swing When You're Winning and Escapology. Following 2002's Escapology, both Williams and Chambers went on to collaborate with other writers and artists for the next ten years, eventually reuniting for 2013's Swings Both Ways, 2017's The Heavy Entertainment Show and 2019's The Christmas Present. In 2016, Chambers and Williams teamed up with Chris Heath to compose the music and lyrics for the Royal Shakespeare Company's musical adaptation of David Walliams‚Äô book The Boy in the Dress, which opened in 2019-20 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon. In 2018, Chambers wrote a children‚Äôs folk opera based on the Oscar Wilde short story \\"The Selfish Giant\\". He released his debut solo piano album Go Gentle Into the Light on 3 May 2019. It reached number 49 on the UK Albums Chart. =Collaboration with Robbie Williams= Chambers co-wrote a number of Williams' tracks, including \\"Rock DJ\\", \\"Feel\\", \\"Millennium\\", \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" and \\"Angels\\". In November 2012, Chambers and Williams were reunited onstage for the latter's shows at the O2 Arena. The release of Swings Both Ways was announced by Williams in September 2013. It was released in the UK by Island Records on 18 November. The album featured cover versions of well known songs, as well as six new tracks written by Williams and Chambers, who also produced the album. Swings Both Ways also featured duets between Williams and Lily Allen, Michael Bubl√©, Kelly Clarkson, Olly Murs and Rufus Wainwright. In 2014, Chambers and Williams toured Swings Both Ways, covering Europe, Asia and Australia. In 2015, Chambers joined Williams on the road for the Let Me Entertain You Tour. The tour began in Spain and travelled through Europe and Asia, reaching Australia in October. They also played at various festivals throughout the summer. In 2016, Williams and Chambers collaborated on The Heavy Entertainment Show which preceded The Heavy Entertainment Show Tour, and in 2019, they collaborated once again on The Christmas Present. Chambers co- wrote and produced tracks off Under the Radar Volume 1, 2 and 3 comprising demos, B-sides and rarities. =Other collaborations and projects = In 2002, Chambers wrote \\"Staring Into Space\\" for BBMak's second album. In 2003, he co wrote \\"Melt\\" with Melanie C on the album Reason, which he co-produced along with Richard Flack. In 2004, Chambers worked with Beverley Knight, co-writing the songs \\"Affirmation\\" (also the title track of the album), \\"No-One Ever Loves in Vain\\", \\"Under the Same Sun\\" and the top ten single \\"Come As You Are\\". He reunited with Knight on the 2009 album 100% and co-wrote the title track \\"Soul Survivor\\" that Knight duetted on with Chaka Khan. That same year he co- wrote \\"Shine\\" with Kara DioGuardi for Hilary Duff. He also co-wrote and co produced \\"Silent Movie\\" with Natasha Bedingfield for her album Unwritten. In the same year, he co-produced American singer-songwriter Aslyn's debut album Lemon Love, and co-wrote the song \\"Here\\", and co-wrote 7 songs on Brian McFadden's debut album ‚Äî including the single \\"Real to Me\\", and the follow up singles \\"Irish Son\\" and \\"Demons\\". In 2007, he co-wrote four songs on Anastacia's fourth album Heavy Rotation. He teamed up with Christophe Willem on his second record Cafeine, co-wrote with Matt Hales from Aqualung on the single \\"Heartbox\\" and with Cathy Dennis on \\"Sensitized\\", a duet with Kylie Minogue, for Dennis' solo record, released in 2009. Additional work that year involved new work with British artists Julian Perretta, Katie Melua, Random Impulse, Marlon Roudette and Taio Cruz. In 2010, Chambers began working on the single \\"World Behind My Wall\\" released by pop/rock band Tokio Hotel. Chambers also co-wrote Tokio Hotel's track, \\"Pain of Love\\" which featured on their album, Humanoid. Katie Melua's album The House, released 24 May 2010, included five co-written songs for her new album produced by William Orbit, including \\"I'd Like to Kill You\\", \\"The Flood\\" (first single), \\"A Happy Place\\", \\"A Moment of Madness\\" and \\"Tiny Alien\\". Chambers also worked on the track \\"Virtual Friend\\", co-written with Armin van Buuren for his 2010 album, Mirage. In 2011, Chambers worked on new material with English singer-songwriters Katy B and Charlene Soraia. He also teamed up with Example, co-writing the song \\"Microphone\\" which featured on Example's album, Playing in the Shadows. In the same year, Chambers worked with Marlon Roudette, producing and co-writing her single \\"New Age\\". A track Chambers had written with Julian Lennon titled \\"Never Let You Go\\" was released on Lennon's album Everything Changes. Chambers collaborated with BBC2 for two three-part programmes: Goldie's Band: By Royal Appointment airing in April and Secrets of a Pop Song which aired throughout July. Through the series, Chambers worked alongside Mark Ronson to create a single, singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright to create a ballad, and British band Noisettes to compose an anthem. Chambers & Rufus' \\"World War III\\" features on the digital version of Rufus' album Out of the Game. Chambers has collaborated with Sophie Hunter on two studio albums: the French-language The Isis Project (2005) and the English-language Songs for a Boy (2011). In 2013, Chambers collaborated with Maverick Sabre in his new West London studio on new material for the artist, as well as working on new material with Rufus Wainwright, and co-writing \\"Out of Control\\" with Miles Kane, a track from Kane's second studio album Don't Forget Who You Are. In 2014, Chambers wrote \\"Crying for No Reason\\" with Katy B. In 2016, Chambers collaborated again with Kylie Minogue, Marlon Roudette, and Rufus Wainwright, and wrote and recorded with John Newman. In 2019 Chambers collaborated with Robbie Williams on the music and lyrics for RSC stage show The Boy in the Dress, the stage adaptation of David Walliams's book of the same name.  Charity work  On 25 October 2012, Chambers, Steve Rotheram MP and Kenny Dalglish called a press conference in the Houses of Parliament to announce the release of the charity single \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" ‚Äì a cover of the Hollies track which was aiming to raise funds and awareness for the campaign for justice for the Hillsborough families who lost 96 loved ones in the football disaster of 1989. The single was released on 17 December 2012 and went on to take the Christmas number one position for 2012 on the UK Singles Chart.

known as Aker Hospital or just Aker) is one of the four main campuses of Oslo University Hospital. It was an independent hospital from 1895 to 2009, under the name Aker Hospital and from 2002 Aker University Hospital. Originally established as the municipal hospital of Aker, the hospital became a university hospital affiliated with the University of Oslo in 1948. History Former logo of Aker University Hospital Aker Hospital was founded as a municipal hospital in the municipality of Aker in 1895. Aker municipality was merged with Oslo in 1948; in the same year Aker Hospital became a university hospital affiliated with the University of Oslo. The hospital was owned by the Oslo city government from 1948 to 2002, when it was transferred to the national government along with Ullev√•l Hospital. Since January 2002 the hospital was organized as a government-owned health trust and the hospital was renamed Aker University Hospital to reflect its status as a university hospital. The hospital was responsible for providing health care to 170,000 people residing in the northern part of Oslo as well as the municipalities of Ski, Oppeg√•rd, Nesodden, Frogn, √Ös and Vestby. It also served as a regional hospital for Norway's Health Region East, which includes Oslo, Hedmark, Oppland, Akershus and √òstfold counties with a total population of 1.6 million.

It is designed to sink or disable ships up to the size of aircraft carriers in the face of jamming and other countermeasures including decoys. Its users include the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, the Royal Saudi Air Force, and the Indian Navy. History =Previous systems= The anti-ship version of the Martel missile entered service with the RAF in October 1972 and the Royal Navy one year later. These missiles were designed around a television guidance system using a camera in the nose of the missile that sent its image back to the launch aircraft via a data link radio system. The weapon officer in the aircraft, normally the Blackburn Buccaneer, used the image to guide the missile via signals sent back to the missile on the same data link. This method of operation had been chosen for its simplicity; in comparison, an active radar seeker would be prone to all sorts of countermeasures, including chaff and active jamming systems, and would require some form of navigation system for the approach while the missile was still under the radar horizon. The desire for a ship-launched anti-ship missile led to some consideration of an active seeker for the Martel, under the name Ship Martel (or Active Martel). As the launching ship would be under the radar horizon of the target, a data link or similar solution that required a line-of-sight would not work. Marconi won the contract for the radar seeker, a very simple one-axis (left-right) seeker that they claimed would be much less expensive than the Adac seeker of Exocet or the RE576 used on the AS.34 Kormoran and Otomat. A small rocket booster was used to launch the missile up to altitude. This role was ultimately filled by the Exocet and development ended. The Ship Martel work was later picked up for a submarine-launched anti-ship missile, a project known as CL.137 USGW (Under- Sea Guided Weapon). This consisted of a Sea Martel with modifications to allow it to fit into a normal 21-inch torpedo tube, using folding wings and fins. The Marconi seeker was used, but was not fitted during testing. Instead, a simple autopilot with a radar altimeter was used in testing at Aberporth. A further adaptation was the Sub Martel, otherwise similar but using the Adac seeker from the Exocet, a sub-launched development of the Exocet itself having been abandoned for cost reasons. Ultimately the USGW contest was won by the Sub-Harpoon in September 1975. =Sea Eagle= WE177A. These developments all suggested the TV-guided Martel was no longer competitive, and a series of studies during 1973 to 1975 came up with specifications for its replacement. This was known as Air Staff Target (AST) 1226 in the Air Force, and Naval Staff Target (NST) 6451 in the Navy. This called for a missile with greater range than Ship Martel, which required the switch to a jet engine. Hawker Siddeley submitted a design using the Marconi seeker and a more highly modified version of the Martel airframe. This would have the advantage of being able to be fired from any aircraft already able to fire the TV guided Martel. Design of the P3T began in 1976, with full scale development initiated in 1979. Although the resulting design looked like the Martel, almost all components differ, with a longer body, larger wings and totally different internal components. A ship-launched version, the P5T Sea Eagle SL, was proposed in 1981. This added two solid-fuel boosters on either side of the missile body, but was otherwise similar to the P3T. It was designed to be fired from its sealed shipping box. The same box was used for the proposed Lightweight Sea Dart, allowing a ship to carry either or both on the same launcher. One advantage to the SL version over competing designs was that it could be fired at very close targets, while most designs, like Harpoon and Exocet, had a fairly long minimum range. Another advantage was that the same missile could be fired from helicopters, like the original Martel, as the rockets could launch it away from the helicopter even at very low altitudes without needing high forward speed to allow the small wings to maintain altitude. Production of the finished production weapon began in 1982, around the same time that the name Sea Eagle was bestowed, with test firings up to 1984 and service introduction the following year. The RAF Buccaneer was the first aircraft to carry a Sea Eagle in active service. This was followed by the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier, as well as the Tornado GR1B in the RAF (replacing Buccaneers) and Royal Saudi Air Force. The Indian Navy also equipped its Sea Harrier FRS Mk.51 and Jaguar IM with the missile, as well as twenty Sea King Mk.42B helicopters, using a version with two booster rockets either side of the rear fuselage. Indian Ilyushin Il-38 maritime patrol aircraft were also equipped with the rocket-boosted version of the missile, carried on unusual side-fuselage pylons aft of each wing. It has also been reported that India sought to equip its Tupolev Tu-142 fleet with the missile. The Chilean Air Force has trial fitted its A-36M Halcon (CASA 101 Aviojet) with the missile, but this combination never entered service. Several variants of the BAE Hawk trainer/light fighter have carried the missile on trials. The Sea Eagle was withdrawn from service with the RAF and Royal Navy by 2000. Design Sea Eagle is powered by a licence-built, paraffin-fuelled Microturbo TRI 60 turbojet and cruises at speeds of Mach 0.85 (1,040 km/h, 645 mph) throughout its 110 kilometre (68 mile) plus range. It is capable of being carried at supersonic speeds by its parent aircraft, with launch at speeds of up to Mach 0.9 and a wide range of altitudes. Ejector launch, typically from a Type 119 Mk 5 ERU, with a pylon adapter where needed, is used. Once launched the Sea Eagle is completely autonomous, with the flight and target seeking completely controlled by the on-board computer system which functions according to programmable options covering a large set of cruise, search and attack options, including a simple, pre-programmed 'point and shoot' mode that allows it to be carried by basic aircraft without radar, using targeting information radioed to the pilot from external sources or even visually located by him, with the missile's short minimum range assisting this. Other modes integrate with more sophisticated weapon systems and sensors and allow Sea Eagle to be programmed during flight by the parent aircraft using targeting data from the aircraft's on board radar sensors or via off-board data-link networks. 'Dog leg' routes can be programmed into the missile's computer to allow a salvo of missiles to arrive from different directions, saturating the target's defences. A twin-gyro attitude reference system, digital flight control computer and autopilot are used to give the missile an over-the-horizon capability. A C-band radar altimeter allows the missile to fly at very low level, minimising the range at which a ship can detect it. The J-band active radar target seeker can detect targets up to 30 km away, allowing a mid-course update of target position through a 'pop up' manoeuvre if required. The guidance system was developed by GEC-Marconi at Stanmore.Flight International 1990 The main wings are essentially of delta form, arranged in a cruciform configuration. Smaller tails surfaces of similar shape and configuration provide steering. The engine intake is under the fuselage - whilst carried by an aircraft this is covered by an aerodynamic fairing which is blown clear at launch. The missile is fitted with a powerful semi-armour-piercing warhead, with a high ratio of charge to total weight, encased in a tough metal alloy casing. Residual turbojet fuel adds to the warhead's destructive effects on impact with the target. Sea Eagle is stored as a 'round of ammunition', with inspection every two years or so, and a life of at least 15 years. When stored the wings and tail surfaces are removed, but the weapon can be kept fully fuelled. Variants A variant of the missile, called Sea Eagle SL (also P5T), designed to be launched from boxes mounted on ships was tested. It used the same rocket boosters as applied to the helicopter-launched version, but lost out to the American Harpoon missile in a 1984 competition to arm the Royal Navy's Type 22 Batch 3 and Type 23 frigates. This version was also intended to have been used in shore-based batteries. The only external difference from the air-launched version was the use of launcher shoes for rail mounting in the launch box, as opposed to the air-launched version's ejector lugs. An unbuilt air-launched, land attack version of Sea Eagle, using a similar nose radar and semi-armour-piercing warhead, was known as P4T. A later proposed land attack variant which would have had an imaging infrared or millimetre wave radar seeker-head and a data link to allow the launch platform to update the missile in flight was studied around 1990; this version was dubbed \\"Golden Eagle\\" and would have had a penetrator warhead to allow attacks on land-based hardened targets. A proposed update of Sea Eagle in the mid-1990s with a dual-band seeker and improved systems was abandoned on cost grounds.

Upon the creation of Abia state in 1991, Aba was divided into two local government areas namely; Aba South and Aba North. Aba south is the main city centre and the heartbeat of Abia State, south-east Nigeria. It is located on the Aba River. Aba is made up of many villages such as; Aba-Ukwu, Eziukwu-Aba, Obuda-Aba, Umuokpoji-Aba and other villages from Ohazu merged due to administrative convenience. Aba was established by the Ngwa clan of Igbo People of Nigeria as a market town and then later a military post was placed there by the British colonial administration in 1901. It lies along the west bank of the Aba River, and is at the intersection of roads leading to Port Harcourt, Owerri, Umuahia, Ikot Ekpene, and Ikot-Abasi. The city became a collecting point for agricultural products following the British made railway running through it to Port Harcourt. Aba is a major urban settlement and commercial centre in a region that is surrounded by small villages and towns. The indigenous people of Aba are the Ngwa. Aba is well known for its craftsmen and also the most populous city in the South Eastern Nigeria. As of 2016, Aba had an estimated population of 2,534,265. History Aba as a City is made up of many villages namely; Aba-Ukwu, Eziukwu-Aba, Obuda-Aba and Umuokpoji-Aba but the villages in Ohazu have been merged with Aba so as to achieve administrative convenience. Aba-Ukwu is apparently the premier village in Aba, little wonder the late Eze W.E Ukaegbu of Aba-Ukwu was known and referred to as the 9th Grand Son of Aba. Hence the owners of Aba are often referred to as Aba la Ohazu indigenes and Chief Ogbonna Uruakpa Nkwoha of Eziukwu Village was made the King of Aba and the only recognised Royal throne by the Queen of England. It eventually became an administrative centre of Britain's colonial government. Aba has been a major commercial centre since it became part of the old Eastern region. The Aro Expedition, which was part of a larger military plan to quell anti-colonial sentiment in the region, took place in the area of Aba during 1901 and 1902. During this military action, the British easily beat the native Aro people with an unknown number (presumed to be heavy) of casualties. In 1901, the British founded a military post in Aba and in 1915, a railroad was constructed to link it to Port Harcourt, which transported agricultural goods such as palm oil and palm kernels. In 1929 Aba was the site of a revolt by Igbo women, historically known as \\"The Aba Women's Riot\\", a protest of the colonial taxation policy. The riot started first as a peaceful protest against the initial census of women in the region, and subsequent assumed taxation of the women based upon rumour. The protests spread throughout the palm oil belt, but remained peaceful until a pregnant woman was knocked over during a \\"scuffle\\", and the lady losing her child. The news of this \\"act of abomination\\" spread rapidly and violent reactions ensued. After more deaths, some accidental, some not, occurred, a mass of 10,000 women marched on Aba. Sources dispute the numbers of dead, with 55 to over 100 being reported. By the 1930s, Aba was becoming a large urban community with an established industrial complex. During the height of the Nigerian Civil War in 1967, the state capital of Biafra was moved to Umuahia from Enugu. Aba was devastated during the Biafran War. Aba is the home of many distinguished families such as the popular Emejiaka Egbu family of Aba la Ohazu, Ogbonna family of Eziukwu-Aba, the prestigious Ichita family of Umuokpoji-Aba, the Omenihu family of Obuda-Aba, the Ugbor family of Aba-Ukwu, the Ugwuzor family Umuokpoji Aba, the Ihemadu family of Ohabiam, the Ukaegbu family of Aba-ukwu, the Ahunanya family of Ohabiam and so forth. Economy Aba is surrounded by oil wells which separate it from the city of Port Harcourt. A pipeline powers Aba with gas from the Imo River natural gas repository. Its major economic contributions are Textiles and Palm Oil along with pharmaceuticals, plastics, cement, and cosmetics. This trade makes the Ariaria International Market the second largest market in Nigeria after the Onitsha Main Market. There is also a Heineken brewery, a glass company and distillery within the city. Finally, it is famous for its handicrafts. Source of electricity Aba is powered by the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company, which was created by the breaking up of the Nigerian Electricity Power Authority, there is another electrical company that is yet to start power generation called the Geometric Power Company, if this starts the daily hours of electricity will improve in aba and the electricity generator is a household item in every home that can afford it, for some places in aba it is the only source of electricity. Religion The city has played a lasting role in the Christian evangelism of the Southeast of Nigeria since the British brought the Church Missionary Society (CMS), an evangelism vehicle of the Church of England used to plant what today has become the Anglican Church of Nigeria. The church named All the Saints, originated out of the evangelical initiative of three oil traders from Opopo- Joseph Cookey, Gabrial Coookey and Zedekiah Cookeys. These men sailed up the Abs- Azumini River in 1896 for their trading and also for the planting of the Christian religion. In 1897, they negotiated with Abayi and Umuocham people for land to establish their oil business at two beaches, which they built at Abayi waterside and Umuocham waterside. They traded oil producers from Ngwa the life, the word they preach, the religious cum trade relationship that transpired, the Cookeys converted the Abayi and Umuocham people to Christianity. From 1901 especially in 1902, they planned an intensive crusade and invited their landlords. This led to the planting of two congregations one at Abayi waterside and the other at Umuocham dedicated by James Johnson (Assistant Bishop of Western Equatorial Africa) (1900‚Äì1917). The earlier converts from Abayi and Umuocham attended service at St. Ambrose, Abayi Waterside Until 1905 when they set up their own Church -shade at Abayi and Umuocham respectively. Joseph Cookey was the volunteer teacher for Abayi while Gabriel Cookey was volunteer teaches for Umuocham. St. Michael's Cathedral Anglican Church was founded in the late 1920s although St. James Parish on the city edge (Umule) is arguably the oldest church because the diocese's first mass was celebrated in 1916. Most of the Primary and Secondary Schools mentioned above were founded by the CMS along with each of their Churches. In 1923, the Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA Church) was established. The Seventh-day Adventists are well known for their Biblical faith, quality hospitals and good educational institutions. The Catholic Church was to follow and also created many churches; Christ the King Church (C.K.C), which for a long time was the biggest church in the city became its bishop's seat and it is now known as Christ the King Cathedral. With the arrival of the Pentecostal brand of Christianity in Nigeria, the city got an enormous share for itself. The Assemblies of God Church, being among the earliest, the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Living Word Ministries Inc. had massive following in the early 1980s, following The Refiner's House International Church one of the newest and fastest-growing Christian ministries in the city. African Gospel Church was founded by Bishop Ogudoro the Founder of African Gospel church. African Gospel church is divided into 10 districts. The present Bishop of African Gospel church is Bishop Uzoaru (2009). In the late 1960s, a group of Nigerians discovered information on The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and established branches, but the Utah-based church did not establish any official presence until 1978. The first stake of the Church in Nigeria and in fact in all of Africa outside of South Africa was established in Aba in 1988 with David W. Eka as president. There are presently 4 LDS stakes (collections of about 10 local congregations) headquartered in Aba and the only LDS Temple in Nigeria is located in the city, the Aba Nigeria Temple. There are two other temples announced for Lagos and Benin City, but with the Aba Temple dating back to 2005. Muslims and mosques are also present in Aba; the largest mosque is the Hospital Road Mosque. A Chief Imam is resident among the Hausa-speaking settlement in the heart of the city itself. Education The city has well over 90 primary schools, most running two sections of morning and afternoon. These sections, which are individual schools by themselves, operate 07:30Hrs ‚Äì 12:30Hrs and 12:30Hrs ‚Äì 17:30Hrs, all local time. IMO state university extension in nursing school off Mosque Road Aba is served by a station and a halt (mini station) on Nigerian Railwaysthis dilapidated and rarely used. Aba is also a major hub for road transport in the region‚Äîa large number of transport companies operate coaches that transport people daily to various parts of the country. The city is second only to Onitsha in mass transportation daily volume in the eastern part of Nigeria. Commercial motorcycles (\\"Okada\\") have been banned ‚Äì replaced by commercial tricycles (\\"Keke NAPEP\\"), and minibus which popularity started in late 2015, and is popular as a means of transportation now. In 2012, a monorail system has been proposed. Sports Enyimba International F.C., popularly called The Peoples Elephant, is the town's most popular football club. Enyimba FC's winning track-record is among the richest of all Nigerian football clubs. With 2 CAF Champions League Trophies, six Nigeria Premier League titles and a pair of Federation Cup trophies, the club is currently ranked 2nd in the CAF Club Rankings.  Waste management  Refuse Skip at Osisioma Junction There are many problems with waste management in Aba, stemming from the lack of a regular garbage disposal, which means that trash piles up in the streets from the many markets that dot the city. Waste Management problems have been tried to be solved through the Federal and State Governments, however, the problems still exist, and have not been solved. \\"Aba is the commercial hub of eastern Nigeria\\". There are well known markets (such as Ariaria International Market, Ahia Ohuru (New Market), Eziukwu Road Market (Cemetery Market ), Shopping Centre (Ekeoha) etc.) that serve the entire region with quality wares, provisions, cosmetics, etc. (See also www.waste.org.ng for more recent pictures captured by a researcher on the tour of Aba)  See also  * Railway stations in Nigeria Notes  Footnotes  References    Izugbara, C.

This was his first book and the Association of American Publishers named it the Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of 1990. It was reviewed in The New York Times and The Christian Science Monitor. The format is a combination of monograph and anthology with contributed essays by artificial intelligence experts such as Daniel Dennett, Douglas Hofstadter, and Marvin Minsky. Kurzweil surveys the philosophical, mathematical and technological roots of artificial intelligence, starting with the assumption that a sufficiently advanced computer program could exhibit human-level intelligence. Kurzweil argues the creation of humans through evolution suggests that humans should be able to build something more intelligent than themselves. He believes pattern recognition, as demonstrated by vision, and knowledge representation, as seen in language, are two key components of intelligence. Kurzweil details how quickly computers are advancing in each domain. Driven by the exponential improvements in computer power, Kurzweil believes artificial intelligence will be possible and then commonplace. He explains how it will impact all areas of people's lives, including work, education, medicine, and warfare. As computers acquire human level faculties Kurzweil says people will be challenged to figure out what it really means to be human. Background Ray Kurzweil is an inventor and serial entrepreneur. In 1990 when this book was published he had already started three companies: Kurzweil Computer Products, Kurzweil Music Systems, and Kurzweil Applied Intelligence. The companies developed and sold reading machines for the blind, music synthesizers, and speech recognition software respectively. Optical character recognition, which he used in the reading machine, and speech recognition are both featured centrally in the book as examples of pattern recognition problems. After the publication of The Age of Intelligent Machines he expanded on its ideas with two follow-on books: The Age of Spiritual Machines and the best selling The Singularity is Near. Content =Definition and history= Kurzweil believes evolution proves humans can create a technology more intelligent than themselves. Kurzweil starts by trying to define artificial intelligence. He leans towards Marvin Minsky's \\"moving frontier\\" formulation: \\"the study of computer problems which have not yet been solved\\". Then he struggles with defining intelligence itself and concludes \\"there appears to be no simple definition of intelligence that is satisfactory to most observers\\". That leads to a discussion about whether evolution, the process, could be considered intelligent. Kurzweil concludes that evolution is intelligent, but with an IQ only \\"infinitesimally greater than zero\\". He penalizes evolution for the extremely long time it takes to create its designs. The human brain operates much more quickly, evidenced by the rate of progress in the last few thousand years, so the brain is more intelligent than its creator. Kurzweil concludes from this that there is no theoretical reason why the human brain cannot create something more intelligent than itself, and suggests \\"a sufficient number of decades or centuries into the future\\" humans will in fact be surpassed by their creations. The field of artificial intelligence presupposes that the human brain is a machine, and that an alternative implementation could be built, as a computer program, which would have the same faculties as the real thing. Kurzweil traces the philosophical underpinnings of this tenet, as well as the opposing view that properties such as consciousness and free will are unique to the human mind. Kurzweil starts with Plato and touches quickly on Descartes, Newton, Kant, Wittgenstein and ends with Hubert Dreyfus. Kurzweil also presents the mathematical roots of Artificial Intelligence including contributions by Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, and Kurt G√∂del. The Turing test is introduced as a way to gauge whether the field of artificial intelligence has succeeded or not. =Chess and pattern recognition= the Chinese game of go than it is chess. Kurzweil discusses how computers play chess in detail, building to his prediction that \\"we will see a [computer] world champion by the year 2000\\". The Chinese strategy game of go, however, has proven much more difficult for computers to play well. He considers go to be a \\"level 3\\" problem, the type of problem where there is no single unifying formula which solves it. Then Kurzweil reveals that pattern recognition, which is crucial to artificial intelligence, is also a level 3 problem. Kurzweil traces various ways of doing pattern recognition, from the rise and fall of perceptrons to random neural nets and decision trees, finally explaining that intelligence is a hierarchy of heterogeneous processes \\"communicating and influencing each other\\". He believes Marvin Minsky's society of mind and Jerome Lettvin's society of neurons are useful models. Kurzweil differentiates logical thinking from pattern recognition, and explains that AI has had much more trouble with pattern recognition, exemplified by efforts to create artificial vision. Kurzweil estimates that the human vision system does the equivalent of 100 trillion multiplications per second where \\"a typical personal computer\\" of the day could only do 100,000 multiplications per second. The way out of this dilemma is parallel processing, having millions or billions of simultaneous processes all computing at the same time, something Kurzweil felt would happen in the future. Kurzweil also discusses speech recognition, which like vision requires complex pattern recognition. =Knowledge and art= In addition to pattern recognition, representative knowledge is also an important aspect of intelligence. Kurzweil details several types of expert systems in medicine, insurance and one for garage mechanics. Knowledge is expressed by language and Kurzweil discusses the state of language understanding including projects such as Terry Winograd's SHRDLU. Kurzweil says robotics is where all AI technologies are used: \\"vision, pattern recognition, knowledge engineering, decision-making, natural-language understanding and others\\". He explains how robots are increasingly successful in structured environments like factories, and predicts that \\"effective robotic servants in the home will probably not appear until early next century\\". As a high school student Kurzweil built a computer which could compose music and demonstrated it on the national TV show I've Got a Secret. In The Age of Intelligent Machines he discusses the relationship between artificial intelligence and the production of music and visual art by computers. He includes the freehand drawings of AARON as well as plotter art by Colette Bangert and Charles Bangert. He briefly mentions artificial life, shows a number of computer generated fractals, and writes that \\"the role of the computer is not to displace human creativity but rather to amplify it.\\" =Impact= Kurzweil explains that the \\"functionality per unit cost\\" in the computer industry has been increasing exponentially for decades. He says computer memory costs one one-hundred millionth of what it did in 1950, for example. Kurzweil admits exponential trends do not last forever, but is convinced computer power could increase by millions of times beyond the 1990 level. If these trends continue, Kurzweil argues, we will see a \\"translating telephone\\" by 2010, intelligent assistants by the mid-1990s, and a \\"completely driverless car\\" by \\"well into the first half\\" of the 21st century. He anticipates we will prove our identity by finger and voice prints and that artificial people will be present as holograms or robots. Kurzweil believes computers will pass the Turing test this century. Kurzweil goes into detail about the Turing test and explains that \\"sometime between 2020 and 2070\\" the test will be passed to such a degree that \\"no reasonable person familiar with the field\\" will question the result. Even as artificial intelligence replaces whole industries, Kurzweil insists there will still be a net gain of jobs. He says fields like \\"communication, teaching, learning, selling, strategic-decicion making and innovation\\" will continue to be staffed by humans. At work he predicts people will use electronic documents that will be a \\"web of relationships\\" like Ted Nelson's hypertext instead of linear like a book. As far as education Kurzweil feels children will have portable computers on which to run \\"intelligent and entertaining courseware\\". Papers, exams, electronic mail and even \\"love notes\\" will be sent over wireless networks. All the advanced capability will alter the domain of warfare as well, leading to laser and particle beam weapons, and planes without human pilots. Medicine will entail computer diagnosticians, coordinated data banks of patient histories, realistic simulations for drug designers, and robotically assisted surgery. This leaves humans open to do research, organize knowledge and administer \\"comfort and caring\\". Handicapped individuals will be greatly assisted by the advancing technology with reading machines, hearing machines, and robotic exoskeletons. Kurzweil believes the prejudice the handicapped now suffer will abate with their new abilities. Kurzweil concludes the book by explaining that all of these advances will challenge us; as computers do ever more tasks that used to be our sole domain, as our intelligence is rivaled and then eclipsed by machines, he feels we will need to figure out what makes us human. Style Sprinkled throughout the book are 23 essays, 4 of them by Kurzweil himself and 19 others by invited authors: Margaret Litvin, Daniel Dennett, Mitchell Waldrop, Sherry Turkle, Blaine Mathieu, Seymour Papert, Douglas Hofstadter, Marvin Minsky, Edward Feigenbaum, Jeff Pepper, K. Fuchi, Brian Oakley, Harold Cohen, Charles Ames, Michael Lebowitz, Roger Schank and Christopher Owens, Allen Newell, Margaret Boden, and George Gilder. The book closes with a \\"chronology\\" listing events from the age of the dinosaurs to the year 2070, fifty pages of end notes and suggested readings, a glossary and an index. Reception Jay Garfield in the New York Times wrote that Kurzweil is \\"clear, current and informative\\" when writing about areas he has worked directly in, but \\"sloppy and vague\\" when talking about philosophy, logic and psychology. Of the prediction for a \\"translating telephone\\" by the first decade of the 21st century, Garfield says Kurzweil overlooks \\"the mammoth difficulties that confront anyone who tries to accomplish such a task\\". The Futurist calls it an \\"impressive volume\\" which is \\"handsomely illustrated\\" and \\"a feast for the mind and eye\\"., while Simson Garfinkel in The Christian Science Monitor says The Age of Intelligent Machines is \\"a tour de force history of artificial intelligence\\" yet laments that \\"although the book is orderly, it is not organized\\" and complains that \\"details are missing throughout\\". Linda Strauss writing for Science, Technology & Human Values calls the book \\"a rich assemblage of glittering parts, rather awkwardly joined\\". She points out that Kurzweil really cannot define artificial intelligence, the subject of the book, because he cannot define intelligence. Instead he relies on the Turing test and on Marvin Minsky's notion of intelligence as a moving horizon of unsolved problems. Strauss feels Kurzweil does not consider the cultural and societal implications of his futuristic visions.

Welsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK government settled on establishing the RAF Penrhos bombing school at Penyberth on the Ll≈∑n peninsula in Gwynedd. The events surrounding the protest, known as T√¢n yn Ll≈∑n (Fire in Ll≈∑n), helped define Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (National Party of Wales).John Davies, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, , Page 593 The UK government settled on Ll≈∑n as the site for its new bombing school after similar locations in Northumberland and Dorset were met with protests.Davies, op cit, page 592 However, UK Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin refused to hear the case against the bombing school in Wales, despite a deputation representing half a million Welsh protesters.Davies, op cit, page 592 Protest against the bombing school was summed up by Saunders Lewis when he wrote that the UK government was intent upon turning one of the 'essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature' into a place for promoting a barbaric method of warfare.Davies, op cit, page 592 Construction of the bombing school building began exactly 400 years after the first part of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542 which brought Wales into the same legal jurisdiction and administrative state as the rest of the Kingdom of England.Davies, op cit, page 592 On 8 September 1936, three Plaid Cymru members, dramatist and lecturer Saunders Lewis, poet and preacher Lewis Valentine and novelist DJ Williams, set fire to the bombing school and then went to give themselves up at Pwllheli police station, in accordance with Gandhian principles. Legend has it that they then spent the evening discussing poetry with the duty sergeant. Davies, op cit, page 592 The trial at Caernarfon failed to agree on a verdict and the case was sent to the Old Bailey in London.

The algorithm can work with any block size between 8 and 128 bytes, and supports key sizes between 5 and 125 bytes. The algorithm consists of 8 rounds and has a very complicated key schedule. It was submitted in 1998 by TecApro, a Costa Rican software company, to the AES competition as a candidate to become the Advanced Encryption Standard. Wagner et al. (1999) found a number of weak key classes for FROG. Other problems included very slow key setup and relatively slow encryption. FROG was not selected as a finalist. Design philosophy Normally a block cipher applies a fixed sequence of primitive mathematical or logical operators (such as additions, XORs, etc.) on the plaintext and secret key in order to produce the ciphertext. An attacker uses this knowledge to search for weaknesses in the cipher which may allow the recovery of the plaintext. FROG's design philosophy is to hide the exact sequence of primitive operations even though the cipher itself is known. While other ciphers use the secret key only as data (which are combined with the plain text to produce the cipher text), FROG uses the key both as data and as instructions on how to combine these data. In effect an expanded version of the key is used by FROG as a program. FROG itself operates as an interpreter that applies this key-dependent program on the plain text to produce the cipher text. Decryption works by applying the same program in reverse on the cipher text. Description High level view of FROG The FROG key schedule (or internal key) is 2304 bytes long. It is produced recursively by iteratively applying FROG to an empty plain text. The resulting block is processed to produce a well formatted internal key with 8 records. FROG has 8 rounds, the operations of each round codified by one record in the internal key. All operations are byte-wide and consist of XORs and substitutions.A detailed description of the cipher can be found here. FROG is very easy to implement (the reference C version has only about 150 lines of code). Much of the code needed to implement FROG is used to generate the secret internal key; the internal cipher itself is a very short piece of code. It is possible to write an assembly routine of just 22 machine instructions that does full FROG encryption and decryption. The implementation will run well on 8 bit processors because it uses only byte-level instructions. No bit-specific operations are used. Once the internal key has been computed, the algorithm is fairly fast: a version implemented using 8086 assembler achieves processing speeds of over 2.2 megabytes per second when run on a 200 MHz Pentium PC. Security FROG's design philosophy is meant to defend against unforeseen/unknown types of attacks. Nevertheless, the very fact that the key is used as the encryption program means that some keys may correspond to weak encryption programs. David Wagner et al. found that 2‚àí33 of the keys are weak and that in these cases the key can be broken with 258 chosen plaintexts. Another flaw of FROG is that the decryption function has a much slower diffusion than the encryption function. Here 2‚àí29 of keys are weak and can be broken using 236 chosen ciphertexts.

The principle calls for all electoral divisions to have the same number of enrolled voters (not residents or population), within a specified percentage of variance. The electoral laws of the Commonwealth for the House of Representatives and all states follow the principle with some exceptions. The principle does not apply to the Senate, as each state is entitled under the constitution to the same number of senators irrespective of the population of the state. Degree of malapportionment Currently, for the House of Representatives, the number of enrolled voters in each division in a state or territory can vary by up to 10% from the average quota for the state or territory, and the number of voters can vary by up to 3.5% from the average projected enrolment three-and-a-half years into the future. The allowable quota variation of the number of electors in each division was reduced from 20% to 10% by the Commonwealth Electoral Act (No. 2) 1973, passed at the joint sitting of Parliament in 1974. The change was instigated by the Whitlam Labor government. However, due to various reasons, such as the minimum number of members for Tasmania, larger seats like Cowper (New South Wales) contain almost double the electors of smaller seats like Solomon (Northern Territory). While all states (other than Tasmania) historically have had some form of malapportionment, electoral reform in recent decades resulted in an electoral legislation and policy framework based on the \\"one vote one value\\" principle. However, in the Western Australian and Queensland Legislative Assemblies, seats covering areas greater than may be drawn with fewer electors than the general tolerance would allow. Proposed constitutional amendment In 1988, the Hawke Labor government submitted a referendum proposal to enshrine the principle in the Australian Constitution. The referendum question came about due to the widespread malapportionment and gerrymandering which was endemic during Joh Bjelke-Petersen's term as the Queensland Premier. The proposal was opposed by both the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia. The referendum proposal was not passed.

A pink anthropomorphic cougar sporting an upturned collar, shirt cuffs, and string tie, Snagglepuss enjoys the fine things in life and shows particular affinity for the theatre. His stories routinely break the fourth wall as the character addresses the audience in self-narration, soliloquy, and asides. As originally voiced by Daws Butler, Snagglepuss seeks quasi-Shakespearean turns of phrase. Some of his campy verbal mannerisms became catchphrases: \\"Heavens to Murgatroyd!\\", \\"Exit, stage left!\\", and a fondness for closing sentences with the emphatic \\"even\\". History An orange mountain lion known as \\"Snaggletooth\\", featuring the eventual character's general manner and Bert Lahr-inspired voice but without collar or cuffs, first appeared on television in The Quick Draw McGraw Show in 1959. The character subsequently appeared in a supporting role in Augie Doggie & Doggie Daddy and Snooper and Blabber. Under the revised name Snagglepuss the character appeared in his own series of shorts in 1961 as a regular segment on The Yogi Bear Show, featuring in 32 episodes. He later appeared in other Hanna-Barbera shows, including Yogi's Gang (1973), as a co- host in Laff-A-Lympics (1977‚Äì78), Yogi's Treasure Hunt (1985), and as a teenager in Yo Yogi! (1991). Snagglepuss's appearance in a 1960s run of Kellogg's cereal television commercials prompted legal action by actor Bert Lahr, who said the similarity of the character's voice to his own could lead viewers to the false conclusion that Lahr himself had endorsed the product. As part of the settlement, the disclaimer \\"Snagglepuss voice by Daws Butler\\" was required to appear on each commercial. This made Butler one of the few voice artists to receive screen credits in a TV commercial. Butler reused his Snagglepuss voice for two other Hanna-Barbera characters: Jonathan Wellington \\"Mudsy\\" Muddlemore from The Funky Phantom and Brutus the lion from The Roman Holidays. Character Snagglepuss lives in a cavern, which he constantly tries to make more habitable for himself. No matter what he does, however, he always winds up back where he started or worse off than he was before. In some episodes, Snagglepuss is chased by Major Minor (voiced by Don Messick), a tiny-sized hunter. A few episodes involved him trying to court a lioness named Lila (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl) but who always rejected his advances for being too boorish or pathetic. Butler's voicing of the character recalls the work of actor Bert Lahr, especially the more mellow moods of Lahr's Cowardly Lion in the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Wizard of Oz. (Coincidentally, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera directed the Tom and Jerry cartoons for the MGM cartoon studio before opening Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1957.) Snagglepuss has three signature catchphrases. His most famous is his perpetual exclamation \\"Heavens to Murgatroyd!\\" Before dashing offscreen to make an escape or run an errand, Snagglepuss announces the move in the form of a theatrical stage direction, saying \\"Exit, stage left!\\" (or \\"right,\\" as the case may be, or \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" even). Finally, Snagglepuss tends to add the word \\"even\\" for emphasis at the ends of sentences: * After emphasizing a previous statement (\\"Somebody hurt! In dire pain, even!\\"). * After stating a synonymous phrase (\\"On account of I must be a little rusty. Stale, even\\"). * In a grammatically correct way, though out of order in the sentence (\\"I wonder if he knows my telephone number, even\\"). * Simply added as an exclamation (\\"Heavens to Murgatroyd! A veritabububble frankenmouse monster, even!\\"). Snagglepuss's pink color, lilting voice and theatrical manner led to the character being interpreted by viewers over the years as gay. This conjecture was touched upon over the years in many parodies but was seriously explored in a darker retelling of the character's life titled Exit, Stage Left!: The Snagglepuss Chronicles, a 2018 comic miniseries from DC Comics that was part of their Hanna-Barbera Beyond initiative. Titles # Hello Snagglepuss! /1959-8-18 Other appearances =Hanna-Barbera= * Snagglepuss appeared in Yogi's Ark Lark (1972) and Yogi's Gang (1973). In Yogi's Gang, he is often referred to as a tiger and not a mountain lion. * Snagglepuss acted as a co- host with Mildew Wolf from the Cattanooga Cats segment \\"It's the Wolf\\" on Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics and Scooby's All-Stars (1977‚Äì79). * Snagglepuss made a special guest appearance at a celebrity roast honoring Fred Flintstone in the TV special Hanna-Barbera's All-Star Comedy Ice Revue (1978). * Snagglepuss was a regular in Yogi's Treasure Hunt. * In the \\"Fender Bender 500\\" segment of Wake, Rattle, and Roll, Snagglepuss (voiced by Greg Burson) was paired up with Huckleberry Hound as they drove a monster truck called the Half-Dog, Half-Cat, Half-track; it resembled a portable stage, which was perfectly appropriate for both Huck and Snag. * Snagglepuss appeared in three television films which were part of the Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10 series: ** Yogi's Great Escape (1987) ** Yogi Bear and the Magical Flight of the Spruce Goose (1987) ** The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound (1988) * Snagglepuss appeared in A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration: 50 Years of Hanna-Barbera (1989). * Snagglepuss also appeared in the animated holiday specials Casper's First Christmas (1979) and Yogi's First Christmas (1980). * Snagglepuss was featured as a teenager in Yo Yogi!, again voiced by Greg Burson. * Snagglepuss was seen in a Cartoon Network Rap in 1995. * Snagglepuss made a non-speaking cameo in the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episode \\"Peanut Puberty\\". * Snagglepuss starred in an eight-page DC Comics' story within Suicide Squad/Banana Splits Annual #1 by writer Mark Russell and artist Mike Feehan. The eight-page story was then followed by a 6-issue comic miniseries Exit, Stage Left!: The Snagglepuss Chronicles (also by Mark Russell) with the first issue released on January 3, 2018.. The comic depicted Snagglepuss as a gay playwright living in 1950s New York City whose career featured parallels to that of Tennessee Williams and was also given a male human lover named Pablo who he was in a closeted relationship with. The comics also featured Huckleberry Hound and Quick Draw McGraw as supporting characters who were also in a gay relationship that were initially supportive of Snagglepuss only for their own lives to fall to ruin after the Stonewall riots which ends up putting Huckleberry in jail. The comic later won a GLAAD Award for Outstanding Comic Book. * Snagglepuss appears in the Wacky Races (2017 TV series) episode \\"Much Ado About Wacky.\\" * Snagglepuss will appear in Jellystone!.

Ralph responds, \\"he was going to the bathroom\\". * In The Simpsons episode \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\" (May 12, 1994), Comic Book Guy shows Bart a cel of Snagglepuss as an example of a cel that is actually worth something, as opposed to the cel of Scratchy's arm that Bart was trying to sell to him. * In the adult animated sitcom Drawn Together, Snagglepuss is featured in the episode \\"Gay Bash\\", but his face is blurred, referencing how strangers are blurred on reality programs. He is voiced by Chris Edgerly. * Snagglepuss made two cameos in a MetLife commercial in 2012, titled \\"Everyone\\".

He was the co-host of NBC's Today show from 1997 to 2017, and a contributor for Dateline NBC. Following allegations of his inappropriate sexual behavior (including anal rape), Lauer's contract was terminated by NBC in November 2017 after NBC reported receiving \\"a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\\" and added that the network had \\"reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident\\". With NBC, he hosted the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1998 to 2017 and co-hosted the opening ceremonies of several Olympic Games. He was also previously a news anchor for The Today Show from 1994 to 1997, anchor for WNBC in New York City and served as a local talk-show host in various cities (including co-hosting various local versions of PM Magazine) and entertainment news segments for HBO.  Early life  Lauer was born in New York City, the son of Marilyn Lauer, a boutique owner, and Jay Robert Lauer, a bicycle-company executive. Lauer's father was of Romanian Jewish ancestry, as seen on the Today Shows Finding Our Roots.Matt Discovers His Roots on NBC's Today Show. Retrieved August 24, 2008. Lauer said, \\"My dad was Jewish. My mom is not. So I was not raised anything. I do feel a desire now to find something spiritual. Getting married and wanting to have kids has something to do with that.\\" Education and early career Lauer earned his undergraduate degree from Ohio University at age 39 in 1997; he had studied at the school's Scripps College of Communication, School of Media Arts and Studies. He had previously dropped out of the same institution in the spring of 1979 to begin his television career, after he was hired as a producer of the noon newscast for WOWK-TV in Huntington, West Virginia. By 1980, he had become an on-air reporter for the station's 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts. He then started to move around the East Coast, hosting a number of daily information and talk programs. He was a co-host of PM Magazine in several cities, beginning in Richmond (1980‚Äì1981), then Providence (1981‚Äì1984), and then New York City (1984‚Äì1986). After the New York edition of PM Magazine was canceled by WNYW in 1986, Lauer and co-host Jill Rappaport worked on a new show for the station, Made in New York, which ran for fifteen weeks. This was followed by Lauer gaining his first national television exposure, as he joined Robin Leach in co-hosting ABC's short-lived daytime series Fame, Fortune and Romance, a spin- off of the syndicated Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Lauer then returned to local television, hosting programs in Philadelphia and Boston for a two- year period between 1987 and 1989, during which time he also anchored entertainment news segments for HBO. In September 1989, Lauer returned to New York City, this time to WWOR-TV, where he hosted 9 Broadcast Plaza, a three- hour live interview program. He departed that series as it took a turn in booking \\"tabloid\\" guests and topics, and for what he relayed as a refusal to live-read ads on the show for Dial-a-Mattress. WWOR-TV replaced Lauer with Richard Bey, and 9 Broadcast Plaza eventually morphed into The Richard Bey Show. In 1990, he was hired by the Kushner-Locke Company to host a pilot called Day in Court, executive-produced by veteran producer David Sams, who helped to launch The Oprah Winfrey Show into national syndication. The program was retitled Trial Watch when it went to series, and ran on the NBC network for two seasons. NBC hired Robb Weller as host over Lauer when the program was picked up as a daily series. The same year, he filmed a pilot for the World Wrestling Federation's bodybuilding spinoff, the World Bodybuilding Federation for USA Network known as WBF BodyStars, though WWF owner/chairman Vince McMahon later decided to host the program himself. In 1991 Lauer appeared as the co-host (along with Willow Bay) of Etc., Etc., a show on the Travel Channel. Career at NBC News President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush in 2005 President Vladimir Putin prior to the 32nd G8 summit in Saint Petersburg in 2006alt=Two men shaking hands Lauer joined NBC in 1992, when he became co-anchor of the early weekday news show Today in New York on the network's New York flagship station WNBC. After a year, he also filled the role of Live at Five co-anchor with Sue Simmons, eventually taking the role permanently and giving up the morning shift by 1994; he was replaced on Today in New York by Maurice DuBois. Lauer remained on Live at Five until 1996. Lauer's on-camera presence would soon provide him many opportunities with NBC News. Lauer filled in as the newsreader on The Today Show for Margaret Larson when needed from 1992 to 1993. This \\"audition\\" period allowed him to join The Today Show full-time in January 1994 as news anchor, while still co-anchoring Today in New York and Live at Five.Live at Five (WNBC TV series) Lauer stepped in for Scott Simon, Mike Schneider, Jack Ford, David Bloom and Lester Holt as the co-host of Weekend Today, and for Ann Curry as anchor of the former NBC News program NBC News at Sunrise from 1992 to 1997. He had also filled in for Tom Brokaw on NBC Nightly News. As the Today Show news anchor, he also substituted for Bryant Gumbel on the Today Show before being named the official co-anchor on January 6, 1997, after Gumbel stepped down. On top of Lauer's duties on The Today Show, he also hosted programming on Discovery ChannelMatt Lauer ‚Äì Profile, Latest News and Related Articles and MSNBC. From 1998 until 2011, Lauer embarked on what was generally an annual five-day, globe-spanning adventure called Where in the World is Matt Lauer? on the Today Show during TV sweeps. The segment was named after the PBS game show Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? from which it borrowed the theme song. This segment sent Lauer to various locations around the world, from where he reported on the importance of each location. He broadcast from locations including Bhutan, Easter Island, the Panama Canal, Iran, Hong Kong, Croatia, and the Great Wall of China.MSNBC, \\"Where in the World is Matt Lauer?\\" In 2009, NBC News postponed the segment in consideration of the stagnant, unstable U.S. economy. On some occasions, Lauer conducted interviews that escalated into tense exchanges. During a June 2005 interview with Tom Cruise, Lauer argued with Cruise about psychiatry and postpartum depression, and Cruise called Lauer \\"glib\\". In December 2008 (more than three years later), Cruise said that he regretted the exchange and arm-wrestled Matt Lauer in the same studio where the confrontation took place. Today Show, May 2009 On June 19, 2007, he interviewed Prince William and Prince Harry. Between 1998 and 2017, he co-hosted NBC's live coverage of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Lauer co-hosted the opening ceremonies of several Olympic Games, carrying on what his former co-host Katie Couric had done since the 2000 Summer Olympics. He co-hosted the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics, the 2010 Winter Olympics, the 2012 Summer Olympics, the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2016 Summer Olympics. His commentary on the 2012 opening ceremonies, along with that of co-hosts Meredith Vieira and Bob Costas, came under fierce criticism, being described as \\"ignorant\\" and \\"banal\\". Lauer with House Speaker Paul Ryan in 2017 On the April 5, 2012, program, Lauer announced that he had signed a new contract with NBC News through 2017. An estimate by Forbes indicated that the contract paid Lauer $25 million a year. It has been widely reported that Lauer had influenced co- anchor Ann Curry‚Äôs departure from The Today Show, executed by its executive producer Jim Bell under the name called \\"Operation Bambi\\". During the 2014 Winter Olympics, prime-time host Bob Costas suffered a major eye infection over the first five days of prime-time coverage. As a result, Lauer replaced him for the sixth day of coverage, and hosted from February 11 until February 14. In November 2015, Lauer hosted an interview with Charlie Sheen, during which Sheen revealed that he was HIV-positive. On September 8, 2016, Lauer conducted separate 30-minute interviews with presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The New York Times reported that the reaction to Lauer's performance was \\"not kind\\". Lauer devoted much of the Clinton interview to questions about her e-mail server, and according to critics appeared to rush through audience-led topics such as domestic terror attacks and veterans' affairs, implying that there was not enough time to cover these in detail. Many also felt that Lauer failed to challenge Trump on alleged inaccuracies, such as his statement that he was \\"totally against the war in Iraq\\", which other sources called \\"lies\\". CNN reported that the short amount of time for the interviews, the short notice with which they were conducted, and the small amount of audience questions were a major reason for the poor reviews. On November 30, 2016, it was revealed that Lauer had signed a new contract up to 2018. Variety reported that his salary was $20 million a year. On January 6, 2017, Lauer celebrated his 20th anniversary on The Today Show with a look back at some of his most memorable moments on the show. Sexual misconduct and assault allegations On November 29, 2017, NBC News announced that Lauer's employment had been terminated after an unidentified female NBC employee reported that Lauer had sexually harassed her during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and that the harassment continued after they returned to New York. Andrew Lack, chairman of NBC News, sent a memorandum to his staff that said, in part, \\"On Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. ... While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he's been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.\\" A network executive said Lauer would not receive any form of monetary settlement because he was fired \\"for cause\\". His contract had been scheduled to run through the end of 2018. NBC News management said it had been aware that The New York Times and Variety had been conducting independent investigations of Lauer's behavior, but that management had been unaware of previous allegations against Lauer. Later reporting disputed this; Linda Vester, a former NBC News correspondent, said that management had to have known and that \\"everybody knew\\" that Lauer was dangerous. In the 2019 book Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, Ronan Farrow cited multiple sources who stated that NBC News was not only aware of Lauer's misconduct beforehand, but that Harvey Weinstein used this knowledge to pressure them into killing a story that would have outed his own sexual assaults. Variety reported allegations by at least ten of Lauer's current and former colleagues. Additional accusations went public in the ensuing days. NBC acknowledged three additional cases from 2000 to 2007. In Catch and Kill, Farrow reveals one of the alleged victims as Brooke Nevils, who says Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room while the two were in Sochi covering the 2014 Winter Olympics for NBC. Farrow also writes in his book that Nevils had additional sexual encounters with Lauer after the initial incident, but she characterized those encounters as \\"transactional\\", and consented only out of fear that Lauer had control over her career. In a statement made after his firing, Lauer apologized for his actions, saying, \\"Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.\\" Following Nevils' allegation of sexual assault that was published in Farrow's book, Lauer issued an open letter confirming that he had a consensual sexual relationship with Nevils and that the relationship started in 2014 in Sochi, but denying that the initial encounter was non-consensual. Two weeks after Lauer's firing, Addie Zinone, a former Today production assistant, made an additional accusation, saying that she had a consensual sexual relationship with Lauer in June 2000. Zinone claimed that the relationship was an \\"abuse of power\\" on Lauer's part because Zinone said that she felt that turning down Lauer's advances would have hurt her career. According to Farrow, Today show booker Melissa Lonner claims that Lauer exposed himself to her in 2010 at an NBC cocktail party. He denies this claim and through his lawyer said, \\"he will not take part in the marketing circus of this book.\\" In 2008, Matt Lauer was the subject of a roast by the New York Friars Club where several of his colleagues made jokes about his reputation for having relationships with his staff. Other work Lauer made a guest appearance as himself on a live episode of Will & Grace in early 2006. In November 2006, Lauer and his daughter Romy hosted the Sesame Street direct- to-DVD show Sesame Beginnings: Exploring Together. Lauer hosted The Greatest American on the Discovery Channel, which used internet and telephone voting by viewers to select the winner. Lauer was critical of his own program, since it tended to favor well-known figures over others who had less influence in pop culture. He served as the 2009 Class Day speaker at Harvard University's undergraduate commencement ceremonies on June 3, 2009. Lauer has appeared as himself in the 2009 film Land of the Lost and voiced reporter Hark Hanson in the direct to DVD animated sequel Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!, released that same year. He also made appearances in the 2011 films Drew Peterson: Untouchable and Tower Heist; archival footage of Lauer is shown in the 2015 film Straight Outta Compton and the 2017 films Lady Bird and I, Tonya. He also appeared as himself in the TV movies Sharknado 2: The Second One and Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!.

They had no children. He later married Dutch model Annette Roque, whom he met on a blind date in July 1997. Lauer proposed to Roque after five months of dating, and the two wed in Bridgehampton, New York on October 3, 1998. They have three children together: son Jack (b. June 26, 2001), daughter Romy (b. October 2, 2003), and son Thijs (b. November 28, 2006). In 2006, while pregnant with Thijs, Roque filed for divorce due to (as papers she filed indicated) \\"mental abuse, extreme mental and emotional distress, humiliation, torment, and anxiety\\" by Lauer. Weeks later they reconciled. On September 7, 2019, Lauer and Roque officially divorced, following nearly two years of separation in the wake of his 2017 sexual harassment allegations.https://www.etonline.com/matt-lauer-and-annette-roque- finalize-their-divorce-131978 References External links * Bio on the Today Show (Archived on January 17, 2017) * * Category:1957 births Category:20th-century American journalists Category:21st-century American journalists Category:American people of Romanian-Jewish descent Category:American television news anchors Category:American television reporters and correspondents Category:American television talk show hosts Category:Daytime Emmy Award winners Category:Living people Category:NBC News people Category:New York (state) television reporters Category:Ohio University alumni Category:People from Greenwich, Connecticut Category:Television anchors from Boston Category:Television anchors from New York City Category:Television anchors from Philadelphia ","title":"Matt Lauer"},{"id":"1142811","text":"La Couture may refer to the following communes in France: * La Couture, Pas- de-Calais * La Couture, Vend√©e * La Couture-Boussey, in the Eure d√©partement See also * Couture (disambiguation) ","title":"La Couture"},{"id":"1142816","text":"Couture may refer to: People * Couture (surname) Places =Belgium= * Couture-Saint-Germain, a village in the municipality of Lasne, Belgium =Canada= * Couture crater and Lac Couture, an impact crater and the lake that covers it in Quebec, Canada =France= * Couture, Charente, in the Charente d√©partement, France * Couture-d'Argenson, in the Deux-S√®vres d√©partement, France * Couture-sur-Loir, in the Loir-et-Cher d√©partement, France * La Couture (disambiguation), locations in France =United States= *The Couture, proposed high-rise in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Fashion * Haute couture, sometimes just called couture See also * Couturier * Culture (disambiguation) * * ","title":"Couture"},{"id":"1142828","text":"UnionBanCal's branch footprint UnionBanCal Corporation (stylized as UnionBanCal) is a bank holding company headquartered in San Francisco, California.

It is the largest coastal lagoon in India and the second largest brackish water lagoon in the world after The New Caledonian barrier reef. It has been listed as a tentative UNESCO World Heritage site. It is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds on the Indian sub-continent. The lake is home to a number of threatened species of plants and animals. The lake is an ecosystem with large fishery resources. It sustains more than 150,000 fisher‚Äìfolk living in 132 villages on the shore and islands. The lagoon hosts over 160 species of birds in the peak migratory season. Birds from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea and other remote parts of Russia, Kirghiz steppes of Kazakhstan, Central and southeast Asia, Ladakh and Himalayas come here. These birds travel great distances; migratory birds probably follow much longer routes than the straight lines, possibly up to 12,000 km, to reach Chilika Lake. In 1981, Chilika Lake was designated the first Indian wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. According to a survey, 45 percent of the birds are terrestrial in nature, 32 percent are waterfowl, and 23 percent are waders. The lagoon is also home to 14 types of raptors. Around 152 rare and endangered Irrawaddy dolphins have also been reported. Plus, the lagoon supports about 37 species of reptiles and amphibians. The highly productive Chilika Lagoon eco-system with its rich fishery resources sustains the livelihood for many fishermen who live in and near the lagoon. The water spread area of the lagoon ranges between 1165 and 906 km2 during the monsoon and summer respectively. A 32 km long, narrow, outer channel connects the lagoon to the Bay of Bengal, near the village Motto. More recently a new mouth has been opened by CDA which has brought a new lease of life to the lagoon. Microalgae, marine seaweeds, sea grasses, fish and crab also flourish in the brackish water of the Chilika Lagoon. Especially the recovery of seagrass beds in recent years is a welcoming trend which may eventually result in re-colonization of endangered dugongs.IANS. 2010. Will growing seagrass beds bring back rare sea cows to Chilika?. The Thaindian News. Retrieved 19 April 2017 History Golabai Sasan excavation site Geological evidence indicates that Chilika Lake was part of the Bay of Bengal during the later stages of the Pleistocene period (1.8 million to 10,000 years BP). Excavations were conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India at Golabai Sasan () just north of Chilika lake in Khurdha district. Golabai provides evidence of a sequence of Chilika area culture in three phases: Neolithic (c. 1600 BCE), Chalcolithic (c. 1400 BCE to c. 900 BCE) and Iron Age (c. 900 BCE to c. 800 BCE). Radiocarbon dating traced the earliest level of Golbai to 2300 BCE. The site is located on the left bank of the Malaguni River, a tributary of the Daya River, which flows into Chilika Lake. This location, which gave access to the sea via Chilika Lake, gives strong evidence of the maritime activities of this region. The recovery of many woodworking adzes and other artifacts shows that Golabai was a boat-building centre. Significantly, Golabai is the only excavated site in Odisha where boat building has been revealed. This also indicates that Chilika lake was very close to Golabai and it facilitated the maritime trade of people in the area during the ancient period. Some ancient texts say the southern sector of Chilika was a major harbour for maritime commerce, when Kharavela (IAST: KhƒÅravela, Devanagari: ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§∞‡§µ‡•á‡§≤, Odia: ‡¨ñ‡¨æ‡¨∞‡¨¨‡≠á‡¨≥) (c. 209 BCE‚Äìafter 170 BCE), the King of Kalinga, was known as the \\"Lord of the Sea\\". Ptolemy (150 CE), the Greek geographer, referred to Palur as the port Paloura, located close to the point of departure situated outside of the southern tip of the lake at Kantiagarh, from where ships bound for different parts of Southeast Asia sailed. After 639, the Chinese pilgrims Fa-Hien and Hiuen-Tsang mention a famous port \\"Che-li-ta-loChing\\" near the shore of the ocean which was a thoroughfare and resting place for seagoing traders and strangers from distant lands. This port was located at 'Chhatragarh' on the banks of Chilika Lake. A fourth-century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships. To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea. The deception was revealed by ships' refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the town's people, who escaped with all their possessions. Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the sea that had betrayed him. The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake. Archeological excavations discovered seventh-century ship anchors and stone memoirs dedicated to battle heroes at a village named Kanas, about north of Chilika on the banks of Nuna river, which flows into the lake. This gives evidence of a historic naval engagement off the coast. A 10th- century text, the Brahmanda Purana, mentions Chilika Lake as an important centre of trade and commerce, and a shelter for ships sailing to Java, Malaya, Singhala, China and other countries. This suggests that the lake was then deep enough for berthing seagoing ships and had a channel to the sea big enough for loaded trading ships embarking to Southeast Asia. The villagers around Chilika Lake still observe an annual festival called \\"Bali Yatra\\" (Journey to Bali). In 1803, the British entered the shores of the lake, reached Puri and occupied Odisha with the help of Fateh Muhammed. Fateh Muhammed, in turn, was rewarded by the British with freehold of the areas of Malud and Parikud, of the present day Garh Krishnaprasad revenue block. Over the years, poets including Kabibar Radhanath Ray and Pandit Godavarish Mishra, freedom fighters and Saints have extolled historicity of the lake as pertinent to its cultural, spiritual, religious and scenic aspects. > \\"Gopabandhu Das, a famous Odiya poet, became impatient to see the beauty of > the march of colorful sights and sounds of Chilika lagoon while going by > train. He asked the speeding train to stop for a moment so that he could > enjoy the beauty. It is because of the beauty that arrests him much\\". Geology The lake is of estuarine character in an ephemeral environment. Geological studies indicate that the coastline extended along the western shores of the lake in the Pleistocene era with its northeastern region lying under the sea. That the coastline has moved eastward over the ages is supported by the fact that the nearby Konarak Sun Temple, built originally on the seashore a few hundred years ago, is now about , away from the coast. The catchment area of Chilika lake has a rock, sand and mud substratum. It contains a wide range of sedimentary particles such as clay, silt, sand, gravel and shell banks but the major part of the catchment area is silt. Around 1.6 million metric tons per year of sediment is deposited in Chilika lake by rivers Daya and several streams. It is conjectured that a rise in worldwide sea levels over the last 6,000‚Äì8,000 years occurred with a pause in the rise of sea level about 7,000 years ago, which could have resulted in the formation of a sandy beach near the coast at the Southern sector. With the rise in the sea level, the sand beach grew gradually, progressed seaward to the northeast and formed the spit of Chilika. A fossil unearthed from the southwestern edge of the spit indicates that the lake was formed about 3,500‚Äì4,000 years ago. The abrupt change in the direction of the coast north of the lake, strong winds shifting sand to the shore, longshore drift (littoral drift), the presence or absence of strong river and tidal currents in different areas are the reasons attributed for the growth of the spit. White bands of coral in the southern sector, at a height of , above the present water level, shows that the area was once marine and that the water was much deeper than present. The chronological development of the outer barrier spit of the lake has been dated by Optically stimulated luminescence studies of minerals. This was done on sixteen samples of the lake bed. The studies indicated doses of between 153 ¬± 3 mGy and 2.23 ¬± 0.07 Gy, corresponding to ages from 40 years at the top of the spit to 300 years at the bottom. The youngest ages are consistent with the age of the overlying vegetation. A clearly defined period of > of barrier construction 40 years ago is identified. Prior to that the deposition rate was relatively constant for 300 years.'\\" Geography and topography This map of Chilika Lake showing Nalaban Island, Chilika Bird Sanctuary, Dolphin Sanctuary, Puri town and Malud peninsula. Chilika Lake-central & west 1958 Topographic map, 1:250,000 Chilika Lake-east end Mahanadi River at Cuttack as it trifurcates with one arm feeding the Chilika Lake View of Chilka lake Chilika Lake Jetty at Satapada, Chilika Lake, Odisha A tourist boat near dolphin point, Satapada, Chilika Lake, Odisha Near the Chilika Lake sea mouth, Odisha Chilika Lake Chilika Sea mouth Chilika Lake is a shallow bar-built estuary with large areas of mudflats. The western and southern margins of the lake are fringed by the Eastern Ghats hill range. Several inland rivers, which bring silt into the lake, control the northern end of the lake. A long barrier beach called Rejhansa, formed by northerly currents in the Bay of Bengal, resulted in the formation of this shallow lake and forms its eastern side. As an ephemeral lake, its water surface area varies from in the summer monsoon season to in the winter dry season. The lake has numerous islands. The larger islands, separated by shallow channels, lie between the barrier and the main body of the lake. A total of channels connect the lake with Bay of Bengal. The six major islands are Parikud, Phulbari, Berahpura, Nuapara, Nalbana, and Tampara. These islands, together with the Peninsula of Malud, constitute the Krishnaprasad Revenue Block of Puri District. The north shore of the lake is part of Khordha District and the western shore is part of Ganjam District. Due to siltation, the width of the barrier has fluctuated and the mouth to the sea has periodically been closed. The location of the mouth has also frequently shifted, generally towards the northeast. The mouth, which was wide in 1780, was only forty years later. The local fishermen, to maintain their livelihood, had to cut open the mouth regularly to gain access to the sea for fishing. Water depth of the lake varies from in the dry season to in the rainy season. The width of the old channel to the sea, now reported to be about , is known as Magarmukha (Mouth of the Crocodile). The lake is divided into four separate zones namely, the southern, central, northern sectors and the outer channel area. A long outer channel connects the lake with the Bay of Bengal at Arakhuda village. The lake is vaguely pear shaped and has a maximum length of with a mean width of . Hydrology Three hydrological subsystems control the Hydrology of the lake. The land-based system comprises distributaries of the Mahanadi River on the northern side, 52 river channels from the western side and the Bay of Bengal on the eastern side. Two of the three southern branches of the Mahanadi River that trifurcates at Cuttack, feed the lake. 61% () of the total freshwater inflow into the lake is contributed by these two branches. The second drainage system which is non‚Äìperennial accounts for 39% (). The important rivers of this drainage system are the Kansari, the Kusumi, the Janjira, and the Tarimi rivers. The annual total surface freshwater input to the lake is estimated to including direct precipitation over the lake contributing All the inland river systems disgorge an annual flow of about of freshwater which is estimated to carry 13 million metric tons of silt into the lake. On the northeast, a channel connects the lake to the Bay of Bengal. A tropical monsoon climate prevails over the drainage basin area of the lake. The lake experiences South‚Äìwest and North-east monsoons during June to September and November to December respectively with an average annual rainfall of , with 72 rainy days. The maximum temperature of and minimum temperature of have been recorded. The wind speed varies from /hour with southerly and southwesterly direction due to the influence of the Southwest monsoon and from the north and northeasterly direction during the rest of the months. =Water and sediment quality= The Chilika Development Authority (CDA) established an organized system of water quality measurements and limnological investigations indicating the following physico‚Äìchemical characteristics of the lake waters. * Lake water is alkaline ‚Äì pH ranging from 7.1 ‚Äì 9.6 with total alkalinity matching the salinity. The southern part of the lake near Rambha has recorded the highest alkalinity. * Bathymetry survey indicates extreme shallow depths in the northern sector, with less than in a large area. The southern sector of the lake has recorded the maximum depth of * High turbidity due to strong mixing of overlying water with sediments is confirmed by observed transparency values ranging between . * Salinity levels in the lake show wide temporal and spatial variation due to a complex blend of freshwater discharge, evaporation, wind condition and tidal inflow of seawater. The brackish nature of the lake is depicted by the 0 parts per thousand near the Daya River mouth to hyper-saline level of 42 ppt in the outlet channel during the dry period. * The dissolved oxygen values were between 3.3‚Äì18.9 mg/l. * Phosphate phosphorus (0‚Äì0.4 ppm), nitrate nitrogen (10‚Äì60 ppm) and silicates (1‚Äì8 ppm) are high in the north and northwest part of the lake where most of the rivers discharge into the lake with large amounts of silt and nutrients. * The lake is broadly divided into four zones on the basis of salinity values, namely the southern, central, northern and outer channel. Tidal influx of seawater during monsoon is arrested by the strong influx of a large amount of fresh water from the northern and central zones. Brackish water conditions in the southern zone, even during monsoon, prevail due to low water exchange. Salinity in the southern zone decreases during the post-monsoon period and in winter as northern winds facilitate mixing of water with rest of the lake. During the summer, intrusion of salt water from the outer channel into the lake increases since water level of the lake is at its lowest level. A general increase in salinity of the central and northern zones occurs due to wind-induced mixing by the predominantly southern winds and salinity in the southern zone does not rise appreciably. ;Sedimentation: Adverse tidal exchange occurred due to the littoral drift along the coast line causing flow reduction and shifting of the lake mouth every year. Estimated sediment transport due to this is on the order of 100,000 metric tons. This adverse effect needed ameliorative actions. Sediment cores were collected from different locations of the lake. The result indicated spatial variation of sedimentation rate in three zones of the lake of /year (Northern Sector), /year (Central Sector) and /year (SouthernSector). The non‚Äìuniform sedimentation rate along with the porosity and water content of the sediment cores were also analysed which indicated the lake had different deposition zones, with comparatively higher sedimentation rate in Northern and Central Sector and a slow rate in the Southern Sector. Conservation ‚Äì threats and management In 1971, Chilika Lake was designated the first Indian wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention due to its rich biodiversity as shown by the facts that: * Over a million migratory waterfowl and shorebirds winter here. * Over 400 vertebrate species have been recorded. * As an estuarine lagoon, it supports a unique assemblage of marine, brackish and freshwater species. * Several rare and endangered species are found in the region. * The lake supports fisheries that are the lifeline of the community. * The lake is of great value in preserving genetic diversity. * There is an Increase in weeds and aquaculture activities. ;Threats: Over the years, the ecosystem of the lake encountered several problems and threats such as: * Siltation due to littoral drift and sediments from the inland river systems * Shrinkage of water surface area * Choking of the inlet channel as well as shifting of the mouth connecting to the sea * Decrease in salinity and fishery resources * Proliferation of freshwater invasive species and * An overall loss of biodiversity with decline in productivity adversely affecting the livelihood of the community that depended on it * Fights between fishermen and non-fishermen communities about fishing rights in the lake and consequent court cases The rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture of prawn has contributed significantly to the decline of the lakes fisheries and bird population. Concerted action was initiated by the Odisha State Government with support from the Government of India to adopt adaptive conservation and management actions. By 1993, the problems in Chilika were so severe that the lake was put under \\"The Montreux Record\\" as the lake was considered to have \\"undergone, to be undergoing, or to be likely to undergo change in its ecological character brought about by human action\\". The purpose was to stimulate remedial measures for the lake's conservation, supplemented with adequate monitoring. It was expected that such an action would benefit from the advice from Ramsar Advisory Mission and other identified technical assistance programs. In summary, siltation from upstream led to shrinkage of the water surface area, decrease of salinity and prolific growth of invasive freshwater aquatic weed infestation, all of which had a serious negative impact on the habitat of wildlife and fishery resources. ;Chilika Development Authority (CDA) In 1992, the Government of Odisha, concerned by the degradation of the lake's ecosystem and cognizant of significant numbers of people who were dependent upon the lake's resources, set up the Chilika Development Authority (CDA). The CDA was set up for restoration and overall development of the lake under the Indian Societies Registration Act as a parastatal body under the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest and Environment Department, with the following charter: * To protect the Lake ecosystem with all its genetic diversity * To formulate the management plan for Integrated Resource Management and wise use of the lake's resources by the community depending on it * To execute multidimensional and multidisciplinary developmental activities either itself or through other agencies * To collaborate with various national and international institutions for development of the lake The governing body of the Authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Odisha State and has people's representatives (Members of Parliament and Legislative Assembly), representatives of the fisherfolk communities and secretaries of the key departments, experts and eminent scientists as its members. In 1998, an executive committee constituted with financial authority, supplemented with financial support from the Tenth and Eleventh Finance Commissions of the Government of India, gave support to the management initiatives taken up by CDA. This facilitated a coordinated approach to plan and implement effective ameliorative management actions. An Integrated Management Plan was implemented with financial support of Rs 570 million (US$12.7 million) out of \\"special problem grants\\" recommended by the Finance Commissions. Hydrobiological monitoring was supported under the Odisha Water Resources Consolidation Project of the World Bank, to the extent of Rs 10 million (US$220,000). A strong support network was created with 7 state government organizations, 33 NGOs, 3 national government ministries, 6 other organizations, 11 international organizations, 13 research institutions and 55 different categories of community groups. In 2003, a collaboration of Indian and Japanese experts led to a friendly relationship between Chilika lake and Saroma Lake in Japan called Sister Wetlands. ;Ameliorative actions Considering the threats faced by the lake, the National Wetlands, Mangroves and Coral Reefs Committee of the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India, also identified the lake as a priority site for conservation and management. The ameliorative actions were taken by the CDA to restore the ecosystem and to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities living around the lake and on its islands involved the following. * Opening the lake mouth The most effective ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention of opening the new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura. This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system. This intervention was undertaken after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a model prototype, were carried out by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out. These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake's fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds. The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by . Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity. Other measures included: * Catchments management in \\"participatory micro-watershed management in a whole ecosystem approach\\" * Protection of bird habitat and of bird species * Economic incentives to the local population to stop poaching of birds * Measures to improve the socio‚Äìeconomic conditions, such as training programmes to develop eco-tourism, * Provision of solar streetlight systems to island villages * Development of a ferry service for isolated villages * Construction of landing facilities for fisherfolk, as well as education and environmental awareness activities. In 2002, Chilika was taken out of the Montreux Record, in light of the improved conditions of the lake. Chilika lake is the first Ramsar site in Asia to be removed from the Montreux record. ;Awards * In November 2002, the Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award was presented to the Chilika Development Authority for \\"outstanding achievements in the field of restoration and wise use of wetlands and effective participation of local communities in these activities\\". * The Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Puruskar, constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India awarded the prestigious Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Award‚Äì2002 to the Chilika Development Authority for the outstanding contribution of conservation and restoration of the Chilika lake eco-system. Flora and fauna The ecological richness of the lake is of great value in preserving the genetic diversity because of the multiplicity of its habitat, flora and fauna. (Some are pictured in the photo gallery). The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) surveyed the lake between 1985 and 1988 and identified 800 species of fauna, including many rare, endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, but excluding terrestrial insects. The rare and threatened animal species identified are green sea turtle (EN), dugong (VU), Irrawaddy dolphin (EN), blackbuck (NT), Spoon billed sandpiper (CR), Chilika limbless skink (CR) and fishing cat (VU). 24 mammalian species were reported. 37 species of reptiles and amphibians are also reported. =Flora= Recent surveys revealed an overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families. This represents about one ‚Äìfourth of the vascular plant species of the Odisha state where some 2900 species altogether are found. Fabaceae is the most dominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae. Certain species were found to be characteristic of specific islands. The flora is predominantly of aquatic and sub-aquatic plants. The species reported are leguminosae, poaceae, and cyperaceae; endemic cassipourea ceylanica; five species of seagrass, and more. Important species identified are:. * Leguminosae, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae * Endemic Cassipourea ceylanica * Five species of seagrass * Wild plants of horticultural importance and interesting plant groups such as insectivorous plants, epiphytes, parasites and lithophytes * Mangrove associates, such as Aegiceras corniculatus, Excoecaria agalloch, Salvadora persica, Pongamia pinnata, Colubrina asiatica, Capparis roxburghii, Macrotyloma ciliatum and many others. =fauna= Brown- headed Gull (Chroicocephalus brunnicephalus) Chilika Lake is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds, on the Indian sub-continent. It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the country. Some species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened animals inhabit the lake for at least part of their life cycle. White bellied sea eagles, greylag geese, purple moorhen, jacana, flamingos, egrets, grey and purple herons, Indian roller, storks, white ibis, spoonbills, brahminy ducks, shovellers, pintails, and more. Migratory water fowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake and remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Lakah, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and from the Himalayas. A census conducted in the winter of 1997-98 recorded about 2 million birds in the lake. In 2007, nearly 840,000 birds visited the lake, out of which 198,000 were spotted in Nalbana Island. On 5 Jan 2008, a bird census involving 85 wildlife officials counted 900,000 birds of which 450,000 were sighted in Nalabana. Removal of invasive species of freshwater aquatic plants, especially water hyacinth, due to restoration of salinity, is a contributing factor for the recent increasing attraction of birds to the lake. ;Nalbana Bird Sanctuary Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of Chilika Lake. Nalbana means a weed-covered island In the Odia language. It is a major island in the center of the lake and has an area of . The island gets completely submerged during the monsoon season. As the monsoon recedes in the winter, lake levels decrease and the island is gradually exposed, birds flock to the island in large numbers to feed on its extensive mudflats. Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection Act. =Aqua fauna= As per the Chilika Development Authority's (CDA) updated data (2002), 323 aquatic species, which includes 261 fish species, 28 prawns and 34 crabs are reported out of which sixty five species breed in the lake. 27 species are freshwater fishes and two genera of prawns. The remaining species migrate to the sea to breed. 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae are reported. Wallago attu ‚Äì A common type of fish in the lake Between 1998‚Äì2002, 40 fish species were recorded here for the first time and following the reopening of the lake mouth in 2000, six threatened species have reappeared, including: * Milk fish (Seba khainga), * Indo-Pacific tarpon (Panialehio), * Ten pounder (Nahama), * Bream (Kala khuranti), * Hilsa (Tenuealosa) ilisha (ilishi) and * Mullet R. corsula (Kekenda) ;Commercial fisheries: For centuries fisher folk evolved exclusive rights of fishing through a complex system of partitioning the fisheries of the lake, harvested the lake in a relatively sustainable fashion and developed a large range of fishing techniques, nets and gear. During the British rule, in 1897‚Äì98, fishermen community enjoyed exclusive fisheries rights in the lake. The fisheries of the lake were part of the Zamindari estates of Khallikote, Parikud, Suna Bibi, Mirza Taher Baig and the Chaudhary families of Bhungarpur and the Khas Mahal areas of Khurda, lying within the kingdoms of the Rajas of Parikud and Khallikote. The zamindars (Landlords) leased out the fisheries exclusively to the local fisherfolk. With the abolition of zamindari (land lordship) system in 1953, traditional fishing areas continued to be leased out to cooperatives of local fishermen. Fishing, particularly, prawn fishing, became increasingly remunerative with outside interest playing an important role. But in 1991, when the government of Odisha proposed a leasing policy that would have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder, the Fishermen's cooperatives challenged the order in court. The High Court of Odisha ordered the Government to enact changes that would protect the interests of traditional fishermen and since then no new leases have been reported. This has resulted in a chaotic regime in which powerful vested interests from outside dominate, and the local people have been subordinated. Butter catfish and Wallago attu are the most common type of fish found in the lake. 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially important. The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn (Metapenaeus monoceros), Indian prawn (Penaeus indicus), Metapenaeus monoceros (Speckled shrimp), Metapenaeus affinis (Pink prawn) and Metapenaeus dobson (Kadal shrimp). Mangrove crab is the most important commercial crab. Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt ‚Äìchoked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000‚Äì2001, resulted in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers. Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of in 1995‚Äì96, the all-time high is reported to be during 2001‚Äì2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 (about US$392) during the year. Recently, the Government of Odisha have issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery. ;Dolphins Dolphin of Chilika The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is the flagship species of Chilika lake. Chilika is home to the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in India and one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to this species. It is classified as Endangered according to International Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). A small population of Bottlenose dolphins, also migrate into the lagoon from the sea. Chilika fishermen say that when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake. Some Irrawaddy dolphins used to be sighted only along the inlet channel and in a limited portion of the central sector of the lake. After the opening of the new mouth at Satapada in 2000, they are now well distributed in the central and the southern sector of the lake. The number of dolphins sighted has varied from 50 to 170. A 2006 census counted 131 dolphins and the 2007 census revealed 138 dolphins. Out of the 138 dolphins, 115 were adults, 17 adolescents and six calves. 60 adults were spotted in the outer channel followed by 32 in the central sector and 23 in the southern sector. Dolphin tourism provides an important alternative source of income for many local residents. There are four tourist associations in Satapada employing three hundred and sixty 9-HP long-tail motor boats taking tourists to a area of the lake for dolphin watching. About 500 fishing families are involved in this business. The Odisha Tourism Department and the Dolphin Motorboat Association, an NGO at Satpada, report about 40,000 tourists visit Chilika every year for dolphin watching. October‚ÄìJanuary, and May‚ÄìJune are the peak season for tourists at Chilika, with a maximum 600-700 per day during December‚ÄìJanuary. The Dolphin Motorboat Association has 75 8-passenger motorboats for dolphin watching. Tourists pay Rs. 250 for 60‚Äì90 minutes per trip(approx ‚Çπ4k for 10 people with 3.5 hours in a private boat in 2018). According to the Association, most tourists see dolphins. Only 5% return disappointed. Besides the Association, the Odisha Tourism Department organises \\"dolphin-watch\\" for tourists. Even during monsoon, about 100 tourists/day visit the lake. Boat based dolphin watching tours impact dolphin behavior and cause several accidental dolphin deaths each year. CDA conducts an annual census of dolphin deaths. They report 15 deaths in 2003‚Äì04, 11 in 2004‚Äì05, 8 in 2005-06 and 5 in 2006‚Äì07. 40% of the 2006-07 deaths were by mechanised boats. Since 2004, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been conducting a science-based community education project to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins and Chilika Lake. They have determined the primary cause of mortality for this population of dolphins is floating gill nets and hook line fisheries and the secondary cause is boat strikes from increasing unmanaged tourism activities. The Irrawaddy dolphins have a seemingly mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with the traditional fishermen. Fishermen recall when they would call out to the dolphins, to drive fish into their nets. Castnet fishing with the help of Irrawaddy dolphins in upper reaches of the Ayeyawady River has been well documented. Major attractions The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands. It was declared a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act in 1973. It is the heart of the park where one can seen thousands of birds descending during the migratory season. The island disappears during monsoon season due to inundation, and post-monsoon, the island emerges again. The vast lake harbours 225 species of fish, a wide variety of phytoplankton, algae and aquatic plants, and also supports over 350 species of non-aquatic plants. The other areas where high concentrations of birds are recorded are Gerasara, Parikud Island, and the western shores of the Northern sector. Eco-tourism The open air and scenic natural flora and fauna of the lake are an attraction for eco-tourism. This is expected to provide a degree of alternate employment to the local community and generate environmental awareness, among local residents as well as visitors, about the conservation and wise use of the lake's natural resources. The locations within the lake identified for such activity are: * Rambha Bay at the southern end of the lake with the group of islands including: ** The Becon Island, with an architectural conical pillar (to put a light on the top) built by Mr. Snodgrass, the then collector of Ganjam of the East India Company, on a mass of rock in the Rambha Bay near Ghantasila hill. It has scenic water spread surrounded by the Eastern Ghat. ** The Breakfast Island, pear-shaped, known as \\"Sankuda island\\", with remnants of a dilapidated bungalow constructed by the King of Kalikote, has rare plants and is full of greenery with appealing flora. ** Honeymoon Island, from Rambha Jetty, known as Barkuda Island, with clear waters has abundant red and green macro algae in the bed is also known for the limbless lizard, an endemic species found here. * Somolo and Dumkudi islands, located in the Central and Southern sectors of the lake, in the backdrop of scenic Khalikote hill range, are inundated remnants of the Eastern Ghats with rich flora and fauna and also known for sighting of Irrawaddy dolphins. * Birds' island, located in the southern sector of the lake has huge exposed hanging rocks, are painted white due to folic acid of the droppings of the birds and is known for rich algal communities and few mangrove species and also migratory birds in winter. * Parikud is a group of composite islands in the Garh Krishnaprasad Block for nature lovers and provides an avian spectacle during winter season * Kalijai Temple located on an island is considered to be the abode of the Goddess Kalijai. This temple is located at a hill which is surrounded by blue water bears. Local people of Chilika refer to goddess as the reigning deity of the lagoon * Satapada village, at the new mouth of the lake, provides a view of the Lake and also views of the dolphins. Hundreds of boats here provide tours of the lake for tourists. * Barunkuda, a small island situated near Magarmukh, the mouth of the lake, has a temple of Lord Varuna. * Nabagraha is an ancient deity located along the outer channel. * Chourbar Shiva Temple is located near Alupatna village, along the outer channel. * Manikapatna, located on the outer channel has historical evidence of a port which was used for trade with Far East and also has the Bhabakundeswar temple of Lord Shiva, an old Mosque whose entrance door is made of the jaws of the whale. * Sand-Bar and Mouth of the Lake is a striking and un-explored stretch of of empty beach across the sand bar which separates the Lake from the Sea. * Mangalajodi a famous bird sanctuary for sighting migratory birds.  Tourist trap and scam reports  Recently Chilika Lake has gathered a reputation to be a tourist trap where a number of individuals run pearl and gemstone scams.Chilika Lake gemstone scam in India Access Chilika railway station The lake is well connected by road to Chennai and Kolkata through National Highway No 5. Satpada town on the eastern bank of the lake is about by road southwest of the city of Puri and at a distance of from Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which is also the nearest airport. A broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railway from Kolkata skirts along the western bank of the lake passing through Balugaon, Chilika and Rambha stations. Within the lake precincts, Odisha Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. (OTDC) and the Revenue Department of the state government offer boat cruises. Private operators also provide country boats on hire to various islands in the lake. There are OTDC Guest houses at Barkul, Rambha, Satapada & several hotels at Balugaon. Before entering into the Nalbana Bird Sanctuary one has to obtain an entry permit. The entry permit has to be produced at entry/exit points, at check gates as and whenever requested by officials. Published accounts =Film= Akanksha Damini Joshi's award- winning film, Chilika Bank$ (2008) tells the story via a banyan tree on the banks of lake Chilika tracing the ecological changes in the lake over four decades. From 1970s, when it was exposed to extensive poaching by the outsiders, through 1980s when the lake was over-fished, to 1990s when the aqua culture ponds became a common sight, and finally the first decade of the 21st century when the environmental interference that was made to protect the lake ended up becoming its greatest threat. Joshi's film maps the destruction of the lake and its abuse for the past four decades. The locals have been looted of their life support system with migration now being their only recourse. The film provides account of how uncontrolled human intervention has turned the lake, which was a sustainable livelihood resource, into a mere waterbody that tourists can dip their feet into. The film produced by Public Service Broadcasting Trust was honored with the Livelihood Award at the CMS Vatavaran Environment and Wildlife Film Festival, New Delhi in 2009. It was recipient of the First Prize at Jeevika, South Asia Documentary Film Festival. Chilika Bank$ was screened in the Indian Panorama section of the 40th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa 2009 in the non-feature film category. The film has garnered multiple television screenings on India's public broadcaster, Doordarshan's various channels. The film was an Official Selection at the Film South Asia, Kathmandu in 2009, the Rodos EcoFilms International Festival,Greece in 2010 and the 4th Samsung Women's International Film Festival, Chennai in 2011. Chilika Banks is displayed in various renowned university libraries like the Harvard University, Washington University, Duke University, Emory University and Syracuse University; and the Library of Congress, de facto the National Library of United States of America.

In August 2014, the name of the sound was officially altered to Queen Charlotte Sound / T≈çtaranui as part of a Waitangi Tribunal settlement with Te ƒÄti Awa. Geography Like the majority of its neighbours, the sound runs southwest to northeast before joining Cook Strait. To the east of the sound lie Arapaoa Island and Tory Channel. Interisland ferries use Tory Channel and Queen Charlotte Sound on their journeys between Picton and Wellington in the North Island. Kenepuru Sound, an arm of Pelorus Sound / Te Hoiere, lies to the northwest and runs parallel to Queen Charlotte Sound. Some of the small side arms of the two sounds are only hundreds of metres apart, but are separated by a steep serrated range of hills. Not surprisingly, one of the settlements on this stretch of coast is called Portage, named for the simplest method of passing between the two sounds. The sound is a drowned river valley (or ria). Towns and settlements The town of Picton, the northern terminus of the South Island's railway and state highway networks, lies near the head of the sound. Other settlements are small and isolated‚Äîoften simply individual properties. Due to the rugged nature of the coast, for many of these access is by boat only. History It was from a hill on Arapaoa Island in 1770 that Captain James Cook first saw the sea passage from the Pacific Ocean to the Tasman Sea, which was named Cook Strait. Captain Cook sheltered in Queen Charlotte Sound during each of his three voyages of exploration at various points, and named it after Queen Consort Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The area was a base for whaling throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, notably at Perano Head on Arapaoa Island. Queen Charlotte Sound has calm water and is popular for sailing - a marked contrast to the notorious waters of Cook Strait. Many ships have been wrecked close to the entrance to the Sound, most notably in recent years the Russian cruise liner Mikhail Lermontov, which sank in 1986 in Port Gore after striking rocks.

Description It can generally refer to any powder used to cast a spell, especially if harmful in nature, but specifically refers to a concoction of natural ingredients that can be used to cause harm, trouble or even kill an enemy. Some historical sources, such as some of the interviews conducted by Harry M. Hyatt indicate goofer dust can be synonymous with graveyard dirt. Use In practice, it was often used to create illness in victims, such as swelling of the legs or blindness. Recipes for making it vary, but primarily include graveyard dirt and snakeskin. Other ingredients may include ash, powdered sulfur, salt, powdered bones, powdered insect chitin, dried manure, herbs, spices and \\"anvil dust\\" ‚Äî the fine black iron detritus found around a blacksmith's anvil. On page 162 of his autobiography Dr. John / Mac Rebennack wrote: \\"Goofer dust is a combination of dirt from a graveyard, gunpowder, and grease from them (St. Roch Cemetery, New Orleans) bells.\\" The result usually varies in color from \\"a fine yellowish-grey\\" to deep \\"black dust\\" depending on the formula, and it may be mixed with local dirt to conceal its deployment. In the modern day, formulations may be thought to include anything harmful that can come to hand. For example, insecticide powders might be mixed with expired medications, dried medical waste, etc. Regardless of any intended magical effects, synergies between the ingredients might cause real medical harm. It is sometimes used in love spells of a coercive nature, the severity of which range from the goofer dust being used to provoke helpful spirits to coax the target into love,Haskins, James. Voodoo and Hoodoo: The Craft as Revealed by Traditional Practitioners (Scarborough House, 1978), p. 208. to the more extreme \\"love me or die\\" spells. Rarely, it has been used in gambling spells. Uncommonly, Goofer Dust has been used as a protection spell. By using graveyard dirt from a loved one of the practitioner, along with salt and pepper and other ingredients, the normally offensive functions of Goofer Dust become protective functions. Etymology The word Goofer comes from the Kikongo word \\"Kufwa\\", which means \\"To die\\". Among older Hoodoo practitioners, this derivation is very clear, because \\"Goofer\\" is not only used as an adjective modifying \\"dust\\" but also a verb (\\"He goofered that man\\") and a noun (\\"She put a goofer on him\\"). As late as the 1930s, goofering was a regional synonym for hoodooing, and in North Carolina at least, the meaning of the term was broadened beyond spells of damage, illness, and death to include love spells cast with dominating intent. A euphemistic word for goofering is \\"poisoning,\\" which in this context does not refer to a physical poison but to a physical agent that, through magical means, brings about an \\"unnatural illness\\" or the death of the victim. Even more euphemistic is the special use of the verb \\"hurt,\\" which is often defined as \\"to poison,\\" with the tacit understanding that \\"to poison\\" really means \\"to goofer.\\" The more general verbs \\"fix\\" (meaning to prepare a spell) and \\"trick\\" (meaning to cast a spell) are also applied to goofering. In popular culture In the 1954 Cold War classic Night People (film), Col. Steve Van Dyke (Gregory Peck) spiked a bottle of Absinthe with a packet of goofer dust. The X-Files, in Episode 14 of season 7 (Theef), referenced the use of goofer dust by the vengeful father of a woman who died due to poor hospital care. Goofer dust was referenced to protect against Hellhounds in the television show Supernatural (U.S. TV series), Season two, episode eight \\"Crossroad Blues\\" and in Season 8, episode 14 \\"Trial and Error\\". In the song \\"Sarah's Night\\" on the Voodoo album, King Diamond sings that the character Salem uses graveyard dust (referred to as goofer dust) to send the spirits of dead people into Sarah's head. Goofer dust is referenced in the more popular series of short films \\"Scary or Die\\" in which a grandfather with a family history of dabbling in voodoo and the occult blows \\"Golfer dust\\" or as she describes to the watcher, \\"The ash of her loved ones; in which she says that the grandfather told her that if she felt love in her heart it would \\"Never die\\" and therefore hexes her to come back as the undead\\". Goofer dust is mentioned in the Willie Mabon blues song \\"I Don't Know\\". It was also used in the song \\"I Got My Mojo Workin\\". In \\"Treemonisha\\" by Scott Joplin, Zodzetrick refers to himself as the goofer dus' man and 'King of Goofer Dus' Land'. Lil Johnson recorded a song called \\"Goofer Dust Swing\\" in 1937. Michael Ondaatje refers to goofer dust on page three of Coming Through Slaughter. Colson Whitehead's 2016 novel The Underground Railroad speaks of a slaveowner hiring a witch to \\"goofer his property\\" to prevent anyone from escaping.

In August 2014, the name Cloudy Bay, given by Captain Cook in 1770, was officially altered to Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay, with the MƒÅori name recalling the early explorer Kupe scooping up oysters from the bay. The area lends its name to one of the best known New World white wines (Cloudy Bay Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc) although the grapes used in production of that wine are grown in the Marlborough wine region further inland. Features The bay faces Cook Strait, stretching north-south over a distance of from the southern extremity of the Marlborough Sounds (Port Underwood) to White Bluffs. Along its length is the delta of the Wairau River, which reaches the sea at two points. The southern of these forms an entrance to the Big Lagoon, just to the north of White Bluffs. The central point is known as the Wairau Diversion. There is also a popular swimming beach to the north known as Whites Bay. Fifteen minutes drive from central Blenheim is Cloudy Bays' beautiful and picturesque coastal community of Rarangi which consists of an original beachfront settlement in the northern end of Cloudy Bay which ranges from the typical New Zealand bach or crib along with some high quality homes. It also has a newer large subdivision consisting of high quality homes within the central part of Cloudy Bay nearer to the coastal man- made river which is known as the Wairau Diversion. This subdivision includes high quality homes along the beachfront and also includes inland housing areas. History Archaeological excavations at Wairau Bar indicate that MƒÅori were living there in the 'moa-hunter' period about 1288 to 1300 for a period of about 20 years. This is the oldest and best researched site of early Polynesian settlement in New Zealand. Cloudy Bay was named by Captain James Cook on 7 February 1770.Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p.67. Sealers first visited about 1826 and set up stations at Port Underwood, the deep inlet at the north of the bay. They were followed by whalers with John Guard setting up a whaling station at Port Underwood in 1828 with his ship the Waterloo. By 1840 there were approximately 150 Europeans in the area, probably the largest concentration in the South Island at that time. Between 1829 and 1832 the Waterloo made three return trips to Sydney per year selling seal skins, flax and whale oil and returning with supplies and trade goods. In 1832 Guard installed Capt Hall as a new master in the Waterloo. On 17 June 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed by South Island chiefs at Horahora-Kakahu Island, just off-shore from Port Underwood.Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p.149. It was being transported around the New Zealand coast on HMS Herald.

It governs how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial business. In addition, the Act contains various provisions to facilitate the use of electronic documents. PIPEDA became law on 13 April 2000 to promote consumer trust in electronic commerce. The act was also intended to reassure the European Union that the Canadian privacy law was adequate to protect the personal information of European citizens. In accordance with section 29 of PIPEDA, Part I of the Act (\\"Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector\\") must be reviewed by Parliament every five years.Section 29 of the Act The first Parliamentary review occurred in 2007.PIPEDA Review ‚Äì Privacy Commissioner of Canada PIPEDA incorporates and makes mandatory provisions of the Canadian Standards Association's Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, developed in 1995. However, there are a number of exceptions to the Code where information can be collected, used and disclosed without the consent of the individual. Examples include reasons of national security, international affairs, and emergencies. Under the Act, personal information can also be disclosed without knowledge or consent to investigations related to law enforcement, whether federal, provincial or foreign.Section 7, subparagraph (3)(c.1)(ii) of the Actthe act There are also exceptions to the general rule that an individual shall be given access to his or her personal information. Exceptions may include information that would likely reveal personal information about a third party, information that cannot be disclosed for certain legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons, and information that is subject to solicitor- client privilege.Subsection 9(3) of the Act Overview \\"Personal Information\\", as specified in PIPEDA, is as follows: information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization. The Act gives individuals the right to * know why an organization collects, uses or discloses their personal information; * expect an organization to collect, use or disclose their personal information reasonably and appropriately, and not use the information for any purpose other than that to which they have consented; * know who in the organization is responsible for protecting their personal information; * expect an organization to protect their personal information by taking appropriate security measures; * expect the personal information an organization holds about them to be accurate, complete and up- to-date; * obtain access to their personal information and ask for corrections if necessary; and * complain about how an organization handles their personal information if they feel their privacy rights have not been respected. The Act requires organizations to * obtain consent when they collect, use or disclose their personal information; * supply an individual with a product or a service even if they refuse consent for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information unless that information is essential to the transaction; * collect information by fair and lawful means; and * have personal information policies that are clear, understandable and readily available. Implementation The implementation of PIPEDA occurred in three stages. Starting in 2001, the law applied to federally regulated industries (such as airlines, banking and broadcasting). In 2002, the law was expanded to include the health sector. Finally in 2004, any organization that collects personal information in the course of commercial activity was covered by PIPEDA, except in provinces that have \\"substantially similar\\" privacy laws. As of October 2018, seven provinces have privacy laws that have been declared by the federal Governor in Council to be substantially similar to PIPEDA: * An Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector (Quebec). * The Personal Information Protection Act (British Columbia), * The Personal Information Protection Act (Alberta). * The Personal Health Information Protection Act (Ontario), \\"with respect to health information custodians\\". * The Personal Health Information Privacy and Access Act (New Brunswick), \\"with respect to personal health information custodians\\". * The Personal Health Information Act (Newfoundland and Labrador),, \\"with respect to health information custodians\\". * The Personal Health Information Act (Nova Scotia), \\"with respect to health information custodians\\". * Memorandum of Understanding. =Personal Information Protection Act (British Columbia)= Notable provisions of PIPA: * Consent must be garnered for collection of personal information * Collection of personal information limited to reasonable purposes * Limits use and disclosure of personal information * Limits access to personal information * Stored personal information must be accurate and complete * Designates the role of the Privacy Officer * Policies and procedures for breaches of privacy * Measures for resolution of complaints * Special rules for employment relationships =Personal Health Information Protection Act (Ontario)= The Personal Health Information Protection Act, known by its acronym PHIPA (typically pronounced 'pee-hip-ah'), established in 2004, outlines privacy regulations for health information custodians in Ontario, Canada. Breaches of PHIPA are directed to the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner. The Personal Health Information Protection Act serves three important functions: * To govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information by health information custodians. * To provide patients with a right to request access to and correction of their records of personal health information held by health information custodians. * To impose administrative requirements (regulations) on custodians with respect to records of personal health information.  Amendment  On June 18, 2015, the Digital Privacy Act (Senate Bill S-4) became law, amending the PIPEDA to include a business transaction exemption, mandatory breach notification requirements, enhanced powers for the Privacy Commissioner, and various other updates. The PIPEDA sets out ground rules for how private sector organisations may collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. PIPEDA also applies to federal works, undertaking and business in respect of employee personal information. The law gives individuals the right to access and request correction of the personal information these organisations may have collected about them. In general, PIPEDA applies to organisations' commercial activities in all provinces, except organisations that collect, use or disclose personal information entirely within provinces that have their own privacy laws, which have been declared substantially similar to the federal law. In such cases, it is the substantially similar provincial law that will apply instead of PIPEDA, although PIPEDA continues to apply to federal works, undertakings or businesses and to interprovincial or international transfers of personal information.  Remedies  The Act does not create an automatic right to sue for violations of the law's obligations. Instead, PIPEDA follows an ombudsman model in which complaints are taken to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. The Commissioner is required to investigate the complaint and to produce a report at its conclusion. The report is not binding on the parties, but is more of a recommendation. The Commissioner does not have any powers to order compliance, award damages or levy penalties. The organization complained about does not have to follow the recommendations. The complainant, with the report in hand, can then take the matter to the Federal Court of Canada. The responding organization cannot take the matter to the courts, because the report is not a decision and PIPEDA does not explicitly grant the responding organization the right to do so. PIPEDA provides, at section 14, the complainant the right to apply to the Federal Court of Canada for a hearing with respect to the subject matter of the complaint. The Court has the power to order the organization to correct its practices, to publicise the steps it will take to correct its practices and to award damages. Proposed Bill C-475 As a result of long-enduring and central gap in Canada‚Äôs privacy protections, Bill C-475 was proposed in February 2013 by Charmaine Borg, MP, proposing several amendments to the Act. Bill C-475 was defeated in January 2014.

Since the 1920s, there have been various proposals for an inter-island port and ferry terminal to replace Picton. However, such plans never proceeded beyond an investigation stage, often due to the capital costs. In May 2011, plans were announced to revisit the development of a port at Clifford Bay, using a mix of private and public funding. Such a port would reduce both sailing time across the Cook Strait from Wellington and the surface distance to Christchurch. It would also allow ferries to operate at higher speeds than they can in the ecologically sensitive Marlborough Sounds and remove the steep grades on the railway line that leads out of Picton. While a new port at Clifford Bay would have affected the economy of Picton, there were positive options to refocus Picton as a tourist centre, and the gateway to the Marlborough Sounds. In November 2013, the Government announced it would not be building a new port at Clifford Bay, putting an end to two years of speculation.Clifford Bay ferry terminal axed. 3 News NZ. 14 November 2013.

It was first published in serial form in the Commonweal journal beginning on 11 January 1890. In the novel, the narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the Socialist League and awakes to find himself in a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society functions simply because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find pleasure in their work. The novel explores a number of aspects of this society, including its organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people. Morris fuses Marxism and the romance tradition when he presents himself as an enchanted figure in a time and place different from Victorian England. As Morris, the romance character, quests for love and fellowship‚Äîand through them for a reborn self‚Äîhe encounters romance archetypes in Marxist guises. Old Hammond is both the communist educator who teaches Morris the new world and the wise old man of romance. Dick and Clara are good comrades and the married lovers who aid Morris in his wanderings. The journey on the Thames is both a voyage through society transformed by revolution and a quest for happiness. The goal of the quest, met and found though only transiently, is Ellen, the symbol of the reborn age and the bride the alien cannot win. Ellen herself is a multidimensional figure: a working class woman emancipated under socialism, she is also a benign nature spirit as well as the soul in the form of a woman.Silver, Carole. The Romance of William Morris. Athens, Ohio: Ohio UP, 1982 The book offers Morris' answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolition of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and work. In the novel, Morris tackles one of the most common criticisms of socialism; the supposed lack of incentive to work in a communist society. Morris' response is that all work should be creative and pleasurable. This differs from the majority of Socialist thinkers, who tend to assume that while work is a necessary evil, a well-planned equal society can reduce the amount of work needed to be done by each worker. News From Nowhere was written as a libertarian socialist response to an earlier book called Looking Backward, a book that epitomises a kind of state socialism that Morris abhorred. It was also meant to directly influence various currents of thought at the time regarding the tactics to bring about socialism.  Looking Backward  Morris reviewed the novel Looking Backward in the Commonweal on 21 June 1889. In his review, Morris objects to Bellamy's portrayal of his imagined society as an authority for what socialists believe. Morris writes, 'In short a machine life is the best which Mr. Bellamy can imagine for us on all sides; it is not to be wondered at then that this, his only idea for making labour tolerable is to decrease the amount of it by means of fresh and ever fresh developments of machinery‚Ä¶ I believe that this will always be so, and the multiplication of machinery will just multiply machinery; I believe that the ideal of the future does not point to the lessening of men's energy by the reduction of labour to a minimum, but rather the reduction of pain in labour to a minimum, so small that it will cease to be pain; a dream to humanity which can only be dreamed of till men are even more completely equal than Mr. Bellamy's utopia would allow them to be, but which will most assuredly come about when men are really equal in condition.' Morris‚Äôs basic antipathy with Bellamy arose chiefly from his disagreement with Bellamy‚Äôs social values and aesthetic convictions. While Bellamy favoured the urban, Morris favoured the pastoral; while Bellamy lauded the Industrial Revolution and the power of the machine, Morris yearned for the restoration of an organic way of life which utilised machines only to alleviate the burdens which humans might find irksome; while Bellamy sought salvation through an omnipotent state, Morris wished for a time when it would have withered away. More specifically, Morris criticised the limited nature of Bellamy's idea of life. He identifies five concerns ‚Äì work, technology, centralisation, cities, arts ‚Äì which demonstrates the \\"half change\\" advanced in Looking Backward. Morris's review also contains an alternate future society in each of these instances. This was the framework based on which he would later attempt to elaborate his vision of an utopia in News From Nowhere.Morris, W. (2003). News From Nowhere. Leopold, D (Ed.). New York, Oxford University Press Inc., New York. Gender roles In News From Nowhere Morris describes women in the society as ‚Äòrespected as a child bearer and rearer of children desired as a woman, loved as a companion, un-anxious for the future of her children‚Äô and hence possessed of an enhanced 'instinct for maternity'. The sexual division of labour remains intact. Women are not exclusively confined to domestic labour, although the range of work they undertake is narrower than that of man; but domestic labour is seen as something for which women are particularly fitted. Moreover, ‚ÄòThe men have no longer any opportunity of tyrannising over the women, or the women over the men; both of those took place in old times. The women do what they can do best and what they like best, and the men are neither jealous nor injured by it.‚Äô The practice of women waiting on men at meals is justified on the grounds that, ‚ÄòIt is a great pleasure to a clever woman to manage a house skilfully, and to do so that all house-mates about her look pleased and are grateful to her. And then you know everybody likes to be ordered about by a pretty woman‚Ä¶‚Äô Morris presents us with a society in which women are relatively free from the oppression of men; while domestic work, respected albeit gender- specific in Morris's work here as elsewhere, is portrayed as a source of potential pleasure and edification for all denizens of his Utopia.  Marriage  Morris offers a Marxist view of marriage and divorce. Dick and Clara were once married with two children. Then Clara ‚Äògot it in her head she was in love with someone else,‚Äô so she left Dick only to reconcile with him again.Marsh, Jan. \\"Concerning Love: News From Nowhere and Gender.\\" William Morris & News from Nowhere: A Vision for Our Time. Eds. Stephen Coleman and Paddy O'Sullivan. (Bideford, Devon: Green Books, 1990): 107‚Äì125 Old Hammond informs the reader that there are no courts in Nowhere, no divorce in Nowhere, and furthermore no contractual marriage in Nowhere. When dealing with marriage and divorce Old Hammond explains, ‚ÄòYou must understand once for all that we have changed these matters; or rather that our way of looking at them has changed‚Ä¶We do not deceive ourselves, indeed, or believe that we can get rid of all the trouble that besets the sexes‚Ä¶ but we are not so mad as to pile up degradation on that unhappiness by engaging in sordid squabbles about livelihood and position, and the power of tyrannising over the children who have been the result of love or lust.' In Nowhere people live in groups of various sizes, as they please, and the nuclear family is not necessary. Concerning marriage, the people of Nowhere practice monogamy but are free to pursue romantic love because they are not bound by a contractual marriage.  Education  Early in the novel we learn that though the people of Nowhere are learned there is no formal schooling for children. Although Oxford still exists as a place to study the 'Art of Knowledge', we learn that people are free to choose their own form of education. As for educating children, we learn that children in Nowhere ‚Äòoften make up parties, and come to play in the woods for weeks together in the summer time, living in tents, as you see. We rather encourage them to do it; they learn to do things for themselves, and get to know the wild creatures; and you see the less they stew inside houses the better for them.‚Äô Here Morris breaks away from the traditional institutions of 19th century England. Learning through nature is the best suited lifestyle for this agrarian society.  How We Might Live  News from Nowhere is a utopian representation of Morris‚Äô vision of an ideal society. \\"Nowhere\\" is in fact a literal translation of the word \\"utopia\\". This Utopia, an imagined society, is idyllic because the people in it are free from the burdens of industrialisation and therefore they find harmony in a lifestyle that coexists with the natural world. In a lecture \\"How We Live and How We Might Live\\" 1884, Morris gives his opinions about an ideal existence. This opinion is the bedrock for the novel. Morris writes, 'Before I leave this matter of the surroundings of life, I wish to meet a possible objection. I have spoken of machinery being used freely for releasing people from the more mechanical and repulsive part of necessary labour; it is the allowing of machines to be our masters and not our servants that so injures the beauty of life nowadays. And, again, that leads me to my last claim, which is that the material surroundings of my life should be pleasant, generous, and beautiful; that I know is a large claim, but this I will say about it, that if it cannot be satisfied, if every civilised community cannot provide such surroundings for all its members, I do not want the world to go on.' Quotes * As he formed the words, the train stopped at his station, five minutes' walk from his own house, which stood on the banks of the Thames, a little way above an ugly suspension bridge. He went out of the station, still discontented and unhappy, muttering \\"If I could but see it! if I could but see it!\\" but had not gone many steps towards the river before (says our friend who tells the story) all that discontent and trouble seemed to slip off him. * \\"I think I know what you mean. You think that I have done you a service; so you feel yourself bound to give me something which I am not to give to a neighbour, unless he has done something special for me. I have heard of this kind of thing; but pardon me for saying, that it seems to us a troublesome and roundabout custom; and we don't know how to manage it. And you see this ferrying and giving people casts about the water is my business, which I would do for anybody; so to take gifts in connection with it would look very queer. Besides, if one person gave me something, then another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won't think me rude if I say that I shouldn't know where to stow away so many mementos of friendship.\\" * All this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to have made the old man talk more. But Dick got rather restive under so much ancient history: besides, I suspect he wanted to keep me as fresh as he could for his great-grandfather. So he burst out laughing at last, and said: \\"Excuse me, neighbours, but I can't help it. Fancy people not liking to work! ‚Äî it's too ridiculous. Why, even you like to work, old fellow ‚Äî sometimes,\\" said he, affectionately patting the old horse with the whip. \\"What a queer disease! it may well be called Mulleygrubs!\\" * \\"Man alive! how can you ask such a question? Have I not told you that we know what a prison means by the undoubted evidence of really trustworthy books, helped out by our own imaginations? And haven't you specially called me to notice that the people about the roads and streets look happy? and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours were shut up in prison, while they bore such things quietly? And if there were people in prison, you couldn't hide it from folk, like you can an occasional man-slaying; because that isn't done of set purpose, with a lot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison business is. Prisons, indeed! O no, no, no!\\" * \\"Then you suppose nonsense,\\" said he. \\"I know that there used to be such lunatic affairs as divorce courts. But just consider; all the cases that came into them were matters of property quarrels: and I think, dear guest,\\" said he, smiling, \\"that though you do come from another planet, you can see from the mere outside look of our world that quarrels about private property could not go on amongst us in our days.\\" * But of course I understand your point of view about education, which is that of times past, when 'the struggle for life,' as men used to phrase it (i.e., the struggle for a slave's rations on one side, and for a bouncing share of the slave-holders' privilege on the other), pinched 'education' for most people into a niggardly dole of not very accurate information; something to be swallowed by the beginner in the art of living whether he liked it or not, and was hungry for it or not: and which had been chewed and digested over and over again by people who didn't care about it in order to serve it out to other people who didn't care about it.\\" * \\"I must now shock you by telling you that we have no longer anything which you, a native of another planet, would call a government.\\" * \\"A terrible tyranny our Communism, is it not? Folk used often to be warned against this very unhappiness in times past, when for every well-fed, contented person you saw a thousand miserable starvelings. Whereas for us, we grow fat and well-liking on the tyranny; a tyranny, to say the truth, not to be made visible by any microscope I know. Don't be afraid, my friend; we are not going to seek for troubles by calling our peace and plenty and happiness by ill names whose very meaning we have forgotten!\\" * \\"As a matter of fact, the history of the terrible period of transition from commercial slavery to freedom may thus be summarised. When the hope of realising a communal condition of life for all men arose, quite late in the nineteenth century, the power of the middle classes, the then tyrants of society, was so enormous and crushing, that to almost all men, even those who had, you may say despite themselves, despite their reason and judgement, conceived such hopes, it seemed a dream. So much was this the case that some of those more enlightened men who were then called Socialists, although they well knew, and even stated in public, that the only reasonable condition of Society was that of pure Communism (such as you now see around you), yet shrunk from what seemed to them the barren task of preaching the realisation of a happy dream. Looking back now, we can see that the great motive-power of the change was a longing for freedom and equality, akin if you please to the unreasonable passion of the lover; a sickness of heart that rejected with loathing the aimless solitary life of the well- educated man of that time: phrases, my dear friend, which have lost their meaning to us of the present day; so far removed we are from the dreadful facts which they represent.\\" * \\"Go back again, now you have seen us, and your outward eyes have learned that in spite of all the infallible maxims of your day there is yet a time of rest in store for the world, when mastery has changed into fellowship ‚Äî but not before. Go back again, then, and while you live you will see all round you people engaged in making others live lives which are not their own, while they themselves care nothing for their own real lives ‚Äî men who hate life though they fear death. Go back and be the happier for having seen us, for having added a little hope to your struggle. Go on living while you may, striving, with whatsoever pain and labour needs must be, to build up little by little the new day of fellowship, and rest, and happiness.\\" Influence The title News from Nowhere has inspired many enterprises, including a political bookstore in Liverpool, a theatre company and a short film describing a fictional trip by Morris up the River Thames exploring ideas of aesthetic and socialism. A contemporary art exhibition at the Lucy Mackintosh Gallery in Lausanne, Switzerland, with six British artists: Michael Ashcroft, Juan Bolivar, Andrew Grassie, Justin Hibbs, Alistair Hudson, and Peter Liversidge during April‚ÄìMay 2005 was called News From Nowhere. Folk singer Leon Rosselson's song \\"Bringing the News from Nowhere\\", from his eponymous 1986 album, is a tribute to Morris. News From Nowhere was an influencing factor in historian G. D. H. Cole's conversion to socialism.Cole, Margaret. The Life of G.D.H. Cole, p.33-4. A track on Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (2008) is called \\"More News from Nowhere\\". In 2008 Waltham Forest commissioned the composer, Mike Roberts, to create a new community symphony based on the story. Incorporating Morris' axiom of 'art for the people and by the people' the piece was written in collaboration with 180 primary school children - all composing small fragments of music that were weaved into the final piece. The result was a 90-minute work for children's choir, orchestra and 10 other smaller ensembles. The work is being recorded with the artistic support of The William Morris Gallery during 2014-15 for release in June 2015 to commemorate the novel's 125th anniversary. The novel News from Gardenia (2012) by Robert Llewellyn was influenced by News from Nowhere. Korean artists Moon Kyungwon and Jeon Joonho were inspired by News from Nowhere in their collaborative project \\"News from Nowhere\\" (2012). In 2013 the English band Darkstar released an album titled News from Nowhere. The book was adapted by Sarah Woods as a radio play, broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 25 May 2016. The Baffler magazine hosts a monthly podcast by journalist Corey Pein called News from Nowhere, inspired by Morris' book.

This was the fourth book‚Äîand third full novel‚Äîfeaturing Charteris's Robin Hood-inspired anti-hero, Simon Templar, alias \\"The Saint\\". The title of the book is a pun on the religious organization Knights Templar. Later editions were titled The Avenging Saint and the book is also well known by this title, which was first used in a 1931 edition. Plot summary The novel, a direct sequel to its predecessor, The Last Hero sees Templar and his organization taking revenge on an arms dealer named Rayt Marius, following the death of one of Templar's friends. The book starts approximately three months after the events of The Last Hero. Simon Templar and his associate, Roger Conway, have been spending much of that time chasing Marius and his superior, Prince Rudolf (Crown Prince of an unidentified country) across Europe. Templar suspects that Marius and Rudolf are planning to follow through with their scheme to spark a new World War (continuing from The Last Hero), and in any event, Templar has sworn to kill whichever of the two men murdered his friend Norman Kent at the close of the previous adventure. Although Templar had been forced to flee England at the end of the previous novel, he has since found himself back in Britain and again on the trail of Marius. While executing a scheme to root Marius out from hiding by infiltrating a bogus nursing home, Templar and Conway rescue who they initially think is an elderly man held prisoner by one of Marius's compatriots; Templar soon discovers that they've actually rescued the beautiful daughter of a millionaire upon whose safety relies world peace. The woman, Sonia Delmar, subsequently joins Templar's fight against Marius (who Templar learns is the man who killed Norman) and Prince Rudolf, even going so far as to allowing herself to be kidnapped by the villains. Templar is said to be 29 years old in this tale. In this book, Sonia Delmar becomes the romantic female lead, replacing Templar's girlfriend of the previous books, Patricia Holm, who is referenced only briefly in the story as being on a cruise in the Mediterranean (this same excuse was used by Charteris to remove the character from much of the action in Enter the Saint as well). This was the first book to indicate the \\" open\\" nature of Templar and Holm's relationship, although in this case Templar makes clear that his heart remains with Holm. The final chapter of the book contains a somewhat metafictional reference in that Templar indicates his intent to give his notes regarding the Marius affair to \\"a writer friend\\" with the idea of his turning them into a novel‚Äîa reference to Leslie Charteris himself. (This same literary device has also been employed by the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle in his Sherlock Holmes books and Ian Fleming in his James Bond novel You Only Live Twice.) And finally, perhaps in a nod to the developing continuity of the \\"series\\", Charteris brings Detective-Inspector Carn (MEET THE TIGER) back for a brief reunion with Templar at the climax. A later Saint novel, Getaway, completed the trilogy begun by The Last Hero and Knight Templar. The ultimate fate of Rayt Marius would be revealed in the novella \\"The Simon Templar Foundation\\" in The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal.

History Front fa√ßade of the church of S√£o L√°zare, Norte Pequeno This settlement was originally formed by peoples from the village of Calheta, around 1690; this is conjecture, based on the construction of the village chapel, which was built to evoke S√£o L√°zaro. This chapel became the base for the current parochial Church of S√£o L√°zaro, which grew and was emancipated from the church in Calheta around 1758. The original church was destroyed in the 1757 earthquake, which was responsible for the destruction and deaths in most of the eastern part of the island. The current church was constructed through the initiative of Father Nicolau Ant√≥nio and completed by Jos√© d‚ÄôAvellar de Mello in 1761. Geography Norte Pequeno, straddles both the central plain and coastal area, which is dotted with faj√£s (coastal debris fields) that include: Faj√£ da Penedia, Faj√£ das Pontas, Faj√£ do Mero and Faj√£ da Neca, which are accessible by foot or pack-animal from the neighboring Faj√£ dos Cubres, Ribeira Seca. Location of a natural spring, Faj√£ da Penedia, is one of the less-visited settlements on the island but one of the more historically natural; it has a small chapel constructed in 1890, several small cottages and a recently remodeled communitarian stove, but the faj√£ has no electricity and telephones. Similar to some of the other faj√£s in the north, this area is recognized for generally unspoiled nature and coastal lakes with shrimp and clam beds. Although a small population, it is still a nucleus of the educational system (having a primary school), as well as many of its own independent infrastructures, including Casa do Povo, Sal√£o Paroquial, Corpo Nacional de Escuteiros (Agrupamento No.223) and a modern factory branch of the Cooperativa Agr√≠cola, where they manufacture cheese. The community is also known for Filarm√≥nica Recreio de S√£o L√°zaro (formed in 1981), one of the many philharmonic bands in the region. Culture The parish celebrates two important days on the religious calendar: on August 15, the festival in honour of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, and on 17 of December the feast day of S√£o L√°zaro, where residents also celebrate the creation of its band.

In the book, he explains to readers \\"How to Reduce Fat in Your Diet and Eliminate Virtually All Risk of Heart Disease and Cancer\\". Some of his recommendations have been updated and revised in subsequent years, particularly in his newer books: Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever and Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever. Summary Atherosclerosis is a disease which is characterized by a progressive buildup of rigid material inside artery walls and channels. Eventually, they become so clogged that blood flow is stopped and the victim suffers a heart attack. This disease is caused by excess cholesterol in the bloodstream and afflicts approximately ninety percent of Americans, though it is a gradual process and may not even be detectable until later life. Kurzweil cites various studies showing that increased levels of atherosclerosis in the U.S. and other western countries are linked to high levels of caloric fat intake. In much of Asia, fat intake is around ten percent of total food energy consumed, and heart disease there is almost nonexistent. Kurzweil goes on to show that in America, closer to forty percent of caloric intake is from fat. Numerous agencies such as the American Dietetic Association, American Heart Association and U.S. Surgeon General advocate thirty percent of caloric intake from fat. However, Kurzweil says this causes a comparatively slight reduction in atherosclerosis levels. He says that he thinks these agencies use an artificially high figure because they assume that nobody would even attempt to attain a lower level if it were recommended. Kurzweil advocates, based on his findings, only ten percent caloric intake be from fat. Hence, The 10% Solution. He says that these levels not only prevent Atherosclerosis but cause its reversal in existing cases. This also apparently lowers the chance of other diseases including cancer, strokes, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He believes that eating a diet that is very low in fat reduces the risk of most major cancers by 90 percent or more. Kurzweil also claims it increases energy and leads to a generally happier life. Further he gives advice for exercise, suggesting walking, because it is low-impact, and easy for anyone to do.

A steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the manufacture of steel. It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of steelmaking from smelting iron ore to rolled product, but may also be a plant where steel semi-finished casting products are made from molten pig iron or from scrap. History Since the invention of the Bessemer process, steel mills have replaced ironworks, based on puddling or fining methods. New ways to produce steel appeared later: from scrap melted in an electric arc furnace and, more recently, from direct reduced iron processes. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the world's largest steel mill was the Barrow Hematite Steel Company steelworks located in Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom. Today, the world's largest steel mill is in Gwangyang, South Korea.\\"POSCO Steel‚Äôs Fourth Quarter Executive Board Meeting in India\\" New Delhi, October 18, 2007 Integrated mill Lackawanna Steel plant in Buffalo, New York ca. 1903, showing the various elements of an integrated steel mill Blast furnaces of T≈ôinec Iron and Steel Works Interior of a steel mill An integrated steel mill has all the functions for primary steel production: * iron making (conversion of ore to liquid iron), * steel making (conversion of pig iron to liquid steel), * casting (solidification of the liquid steel), * roughing rolling/billet rolling (reducing size of blocks) * product rolling (finished shapes). The principal raw materials for an integrated mill are iron ore, limestone, and coal (or coke). These materials are charged in batches into a blast furnace where the iron compounds in the ore give up excess oxygen and become liquid iron. At intervals of a few hours, the accumulated liquid iron is tapped from the blast furnace and either cast into pig iron or directed to other vessels for further steel making operations. Historically the Bessemer process was a major advancement in the production of economical steel, but it has now been entirely replaced by other processes such as the basic oxygen furnace. Molten steel is cast into large blocks called blooms. During the casting process various methods are used, such as addition of aluminum, so that impurities in the steel float to the surface where they can be cut off the finished bloom. Because of the energy cost and structural stress associated with heating and cooling a blast furnace, typically these primary steel making vessels will operate on a continuous production campaign of several years duration. Even during periods of low steel demand, it may not be feasible to let the blast furnace grow cold, though some adjustment of the production rate is possible. Integrated mills are large facilities that are typically only economical to build in 2,000,000-ton per year annual capacity and up. Final products made by an integrated plant are usually large structural sections, heavy plate, strip, wire rod, railway rails, and occasionally long products such as bars and pipe. A major environmental hazard associated with integrated steel mills is the pollution produced in the manufacture of coke, which is an essential intermediate product in the reduction of iron ore in a blast furnace. Integrated mills may also adopt some of the processes used in mini-mills, such as arc furnaces and direct casting, to reduce production costs. Minimill An ingot of steel entering a rolling mill A minimill is traditionally a secondary steel producer; however, Nucor (one of the world's largest steel producers) and Commercial Metals Company (CMC) use minimills exclusively. Usually it obtains most of its iron from scrap steel, recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of manufacturing. Direct reduced iron (DRI) is sometimes used with scrap, to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel, though usually DRI is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material. A typical mini-mill will have an electric arc furnace for scrap melting, a ladle furnace or vacuum furnace for precision control of chemistry, a strip or billet continuous caster for converting molten steel to solid form, a reheat furnace and a rolling mill. Originally the mini mill was adapted to production of bar products only, such as concrete reinforcing bar, flats, angles, channels, pipe, and light rails. Since the late 1980s, successful introduction of the direct strip casting process has made mini mill production of strip feasible. Often a mini mill will be constructed in an area with no other steel production, to take advantage of local markets, resources, or lower-cost labour. Mini mill plants may specialize, for example, in making coils of rod for wire-drawing use, or pipe, or in special sections for transportation and agriculture. Capacities of mini mills vary: some plants may make as much as 3,000,000 tons per year, a typical size is in the range 200,000 to 400,000 tons per year, and some old or specialty plants may make as little as 50,000 tons per year of finished product. Nucor Corporation, for example, annually produces around 9,100,000 tons of sheet steel from its four sheet mills, 6,700,000 tons of bar steel from its 10 bar mills and 2,100,000 tons of plate steel from its two plate mills. Since the electric arc furnace can be easily started and stopped on a regular basis, mini mills can follow the market demand for their products easily, operating on 24-hour schedules when demand is high and cutting back production when sales are lower.

Based on the earliest records of the Magyars in Byzantine, Western European, and Hungarian chronicles, scholars considered them for centuries to have been the descendants of the ancient Scythians and Huns. This historiographical tradition disappeared from mainstream history after the realization of similarities between the Hungarian language and the Uralic languages in the late . Thereafter, linguistics became the principal source of the study of the Hungarians' ethnogenesis. In addition, chronicles written between the , the results of archaeological research and folklore analogies provide information on the Magyars' early history. Study of pollen in fossils based on cognate words for certain treesincluding larch and elmin the daughter languages suggests the speakers of the Proto-Uralic language lived in the wider region of the Ural Mountains, which were inhabited by scattered groups of Neolithic hunter-gatherers in the . They spread over vast territories, which caused the development of a separate Proto-Finno-Ugric language by the end of the millennium. Linguistic studies and archaeological research evidence that those who spoke this language lived in pit-houses and used decorated clay vessels. The expansion of marshlands after around caused new migrations. No scholarly consensus on the Urheimat, or original homeland, of the Ugric peoples exists: they lived either in the region of the Tobol River or along the Kama River and the upper courses of the Volga River around . They lived in settled communities, cultivated millet, wheat, and other crops, and bred animalsespecially horses, cattle, and pigs. Loan words connected to animal husbandry from Proto-Iranian show that they had close contacts with their neighbors. The southernmost Ugric groups adopted a nomadic way of life by around , because of the northward expansion of the steppes. The development of the Hungarian language started around with the withdrawal of the grasslands and the parallel southward migration of the nomadic Ugric groups. The history of the ancient Magyars during the next thousand years is uncertain; they lived in the steppes but the location of their Urheimat is subject to scholarly debates. According to one theory, they initially lived east of the Urals and migrated west to \\"Magna Hungaria\\" by at the latest. Other scholars say Magna Hungaria was the Magyars' original homeland, from where they moved either to the region of the Don River or towards the Kuban River before the . Hundreds of loan words adopted from Chuvash-type Turkic languages prove the Magyars were closely connected to Turkic peoples. Byzantine and Muslim authors regarded them as a Turkic people in the . An alliance between the Magyars and the Bulgarians in the late 830s was the first historical event that was recorded with certainty in connection with the Magyars. According to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the Magyars lived in Levedia in the vicinity of the Khazar Khaganate in the early and supported the Khazars in their wars \\"for three years\\". The Magyars were organized into tribes, each headed by their own \\"voivodes\\", or military leaders. After a Pecheneg invasion against Levedia, a group of Magyars crossed the Caucasus Mountains and settled in the lands south of the mountains, but the majority of the people fled to the steppes north of the Black Sea. From their new homeland, which was known as Etelk√∂z, the Magyars controlled the lands between the Lower Danube and the Don River in the 870s. The confederation of their seven tribes was led by two supreme chiefs, the kende and the gyula. The Kabarsa group of rebellious subjects of the Khazarsjoined the Magyars in Etelk√∂z. The Magyars regularly invaded the neighboring Slavic tribes, forcing them to pay a tribute and seizing prisoners to be sold to the Byzantines. Taking advantage of the wars between Bulgaria, East Francia, and Moravia, they invaded Central Europe at least four times between 861 and 894. A new Pecheneg invasion compelled the Magyars to leave Etelk√∂z, cross the Carpathian Mountains, and settle in the Carpathian Basin around 895.  Sources  = Archaeology = A fastener from the 9th century, unearthed in Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine; the finding belongs to the \\"Subotcy horizon\\", attributed to the pre-conquest Hungarians Since the 1830s, archaeology has played an important role in the study of the Magyar prehistory. Archaeologists have applied two methods; the so-called \\"linear method\\" attempts to determine the route of the migrating Magyars from their original homeland to the Carpathian Basin, while the \\"retrospective method\\" tries to discover the antecedents of 10th-century assemblages from the Carpathian Basin in the Eurasian steppes. However, only twelve cemeteries in the steppes have yielded finds that show similarities to assemblages unearthed in the Carpathian Basin. The dating of those cemeteries is also controversial. Both the scarcity of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites may have contributed to the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs. Kov√°cs also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre- conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland. Migration of Hungarians Buckles, belt mounts, and other objects of the so- called \\"Subotcy horizon\\", which were unearthed at Caterinovca, Slobozia, and other sites along the middle course of the Dniester show similarities with archaeological finds from the 10th-century Carpathian Basin. These objects were carbon dated to the late . The same archaeological sites also yielded vessels similar to the pottery of the neighboring Slavic territories. = Linguistics = The study of the Hungarian language is one of the main sources of the research on the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms. According to a scholarly theory, the oldest layers of Hungarian vocabulary show features of the territory in which the language emerged. The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of the Hungarian language and other peoples. Loan words also reflect changes in the way of life of the Magyars. = Written sources = The first page of the sole manuscript preserving the text of the Gesta Hungarorum, the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle Written sources on the prehistoric Hungarians may begin with Herodotus, who wrote of the Iyrcae, a people of equestrian hunters who lived next to the Thyssagetae. Based on the location of the homeland of the Iyrcae and their ethnonym, Gyula Moravcsik, J√°nos Harmatta, and other scholars identify them as Hungarians; their view has not been universally accepted. The 6th-century Byzantine historian John Malalas referred to a Hunnic tribal leader called Muageris, who ruled around . Moravcsik, Dezs≈ë Pais, and other historians connect Muageris's name to the Hungarians' endonym (Magyar); they say Malalas's report proves the presence of Magyar tribes in the region of the Sea of Azov in the early . This identification is rejected by most scholars. The Continuation of the Chronicle by Friar George, which was written in the middle of the , recorded the first historical event ‚Äì an alliance between the Magyars and the Bulgarians in the late 830s ‚Äì that can without doubt be connected to the Magyars. The Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise's Tactics, a book written around 904, contained a detailed description of their military strategies and way of life. Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De administrando imperio (\\"On Governing the Empire\\"), which was completed between 948 and 952, preserves most information on the Magyars' early history. Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani, the minister of Nasr II, ruler of the Samanid Empire, collected the reports of merchants who had traveled in the western regions of the Eurasian steppes in the 870s and 880s. Although Al-Jayhani's work was lost, later Muslim scholars Ibn Rusta, Gardizi, Abu Tahir Marwazi, and Al-Bakri used his book, preserving important facts about the late 9th-century Magyars. However, their works also contain interpolations from later periods. Among the sources written in Western Europe, the longer version of the Annals of Salzburg, Regino of Pr√ºm's Chronicon, the Annals of Fulda, and Liutprand of Cremona's Antapodosis (\\"Retribution\\"), provide contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous information of the 9th-century Magyars. There are also references to the Magyars dwelling in the Pontic steppes in the legends of Cyril, Methodius and other early Slavic saints. According to historian Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas, information preserved in the Russian Primary Chronicle, which was completed in the 1110s, has to be \\"treated with extreme caution\\". The first Hungarian chronicles were written in the late 11th or early but their texts were preserved in manuscripts compiled in the 13th to 15th centuries. Most extant chronicles show that the earliest works contained no information on the history of the Hungarians before their conversion to Christianity in the 11th century. The only exception is the Gesta Hungarorum, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle, whose principal subject is the Magyars' pagan past. However, the reliability of this work, which was written by a former royal notary now known as Anonymus, is suspect. In his monograph of medieval Hungarian historians, Carlile Aylmer Macartney describes it as \\"the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts\\".  Ethnonyms  The Hungarians were mentioned under various ethnic names in Arabic, Byzantine, Slavic, and Western European sources in the 9th and 10th centuries. Arabic scholars referred to them as Magyars, Bashkirs, or Turks; Byzantine authors mentioned them as Huns, Ungrs, Turks, or Savards; Slavic sources used the ethnonyms Ugr or Peon, and Western European authors wrote of Hungrs, Pannons, Avars, Huns, Turks, and Agaren. According to the linguist Gyula N√©meth, the multiple ethnonymsespecially Ungr, Savard, and Turkreflect that the Magyars had been integrated in various empires of the Eurasian steppesthe tribal confederations of the Onogurs and of the Sabirs, and the G√∂kt√ºrksbefore gaining their independence. Ibn Rusta was the first to record a variant of the Hungarians' self-designation; (al-Madjghariyya). According to a scholarly theory, the ethnonym \\"Magyar\\" is a composite word. The first part of the word (magy-) is said to have been connected to several recorded or hypothetical words, including the Mansi's self-designation (mƒÅ≈Ñ≈õi) and a reconstructed Ugric word for man (*ma≈Ñƒáa). The second part (-er or -ar) may have developed from a reconstructed Finno-Ugrian word for man or boy (*irk√§) or from a Turkic word with a similar meaning (eri or iri). Alan W. Ertl writes that the ethnonym was initially the name of a smaller group, the Megyer tribe; it developed into an ethnonym because Megyer was the most powerful tribe within the people. Most scholars agree that the Hungarian exonym and its variants were derived from the Onogurs' name. This form started spreading in Europe with Slavic mediation.  Legend of the Wondrous Hind  legend of the wondrous hind\\" depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle Most historians agree that the legend of the wondrous hind preserved the Hungarians' own myth of their origins. The late 13th-century chronicler Simon of K√©za was the first to record it. The legend says two brothers, Hunor and Magor, were the forefathers of the Huns and Hungarians. They were the sons of M√©nr√≥t and his wife, Eneth. While chasing a hind, they reached as far as the marches of the Sea of Azov, where they abducted the wives of Belar's sons and two daughters of Dula, the prince of the Alans. According to historian Gyula Krist√≥, Eneth's name derived from the Hungarian word for hind (√ºn≈ë), showing that the Magyars regarded this animal as their totemistic ancestor. Krist√≥ also says the four personal names mentioned in the legend personify four peoples: the Hungarians (Magor), the Onogurs (Hunor), the Bulgars (Belar) and the Dulakindred of the Alans or Bulgars (Dulo). The hunt for a beast, ending with the arrival in a new homeland, was a popular legend among the peoples of the Eurasian steppes, including the Huns and the Mansi. The myth that a people were descended from two brothers was also widespread. Consequently, it is possible that Simon of K√©za did not record a genuine Hungarian legend, but borrowed it from foreign sources.  Historiography  = Medieval theories = According to the Annals of St. Bertin, the Magyars who invaded East Francia in 862 were enemies \\"hitherto unknown\\"The Annals of St-Bertin (year 862), p. 102 to the local population. Likewise, Regino of Pr√ºm wrote that the Magyars had been \\"unheard of in the previous centuries because they were not named\\".The Chronicle of Regino of Pr√ºm (year 889), p. 202. in the sources. Both remarks evince that late 9th-century authors had no knowledge of the Magyars' origins. However, the Magyar raids reminded the Western European and Byzantine scholars of earlier historians' descriptions of the Scythians or Huns, which gave rise to their identification with those peoples. For instance, Leo the Wise listed the Hungarians among the \\"Scythian nations\\".The Taktika of Leo VI (18.41), p. 453. The similarity between the Latin ethnonyms Huni and Hungari strengthened the identification of the two peoples, which became commonplace in Western Europe in the 11th century. The Chronicon Eberspergense was the first source that clearly stated that the Huns and the Hungarians were the same people. The earliest Hungarian chronicles adopted the idea that the Huns and Hungarians were closely related. Anonymus did not mention the Huns, but he referred to Attila the Hun as a ruler \\"from whose line Prince √Ålmos\\",Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 5), p. 17. the supreme head of the Magyar tribes, descended. However, Simon of K√©za explicitly identified the Huns and the Hungarians in the 1280. He started his chronicle with a book of the history of the Huns, thus presenting the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin as the reoccupation of a land inherited from their ancestors. Thereafter the identification of the two peoples was the basic theory of the origins of the Hungarians for centuries. = Modern scholarship = The title page of J√°nos Sajnovics's Demonstratio, the first systematic study of the comparison of the Hungarian and Saami languages Scholarly attempts in the early 18th century to prove a relationship between the Finns and the Huns led to the realization of the similarities between the Finnish and Hungarian languages. J√°nos Sajnovics's Demonstratio, the first systematic comparative study of Hungarian and the Saami languages, was published in 1770. Three decades later, S√°muel Gyarmathi demonstrated similarities between a larger group of languages that are now known as Uralic languages. However, the majority of Hungarian scholars only gradually adopted Sajnovics's and Gyarmathi's views. In the 1830s, P√°l Hunfalvy still wrote that Hungarian had an intermediate position between the Finnish and Turkic languages, but later accepted that Hungarian is closely related to the Mansi and Khanty languages. Hereafter linguistics played a pre-eminent role in the research of the Magyars' prehistory because it was always the dominant linguistic theory that determined the interpretation of historical and archaeological evidence. Consequently, as historian N√≥ra Berend writes, Hungarian prehistory is \\"a tenuous construct based on linguistics, folklore analogies, archaeology, and later written evidence\\", because there are no certain records of the Magyars before the and the identification of archaeological cultures with peoples is highly debatable. Historian L√°szl√≥ Kontler identifies \\"the history of Hungarian origins\\" as \\"the history of a community whose genetic composition and cultural character has been changing, but which has assuredly spoken Hungarian or its predecessor language\\". According to mainstream scholarly consensus, the Hungarians are not the autochthonous population of the Carpathian Basin. Their ancestors arrived there through a series of westward migrations across the Eurasian steppes around 894, centuries after their departure from their original homeland located somewhere in the East. Many details of the Magyars' prehistorythe location of their original homeland, the ancient Magyars' connections with the Turkic peoples and the Khazar Khaganate, their lifestyle and political organization, and the background of their conquest of the Carpathian Basinare still subject to scholarly debates. With regard of the connections between the Magyars and the Turkic tribes, archaeologist Gyula L√°szl√≥ mooted an alternative theory in the 1960s. According to his theory of the \\"double conquest\\", a large group of people who spoke a Finno-Ugrian language arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 670, and a Turkic-speaking people conquered the same territory in the late 9th century. L√°szl√≥'s theory has never been widely accepted.  Formation of the Magyar people  = Before the separation of the Hungarian language (before 800 BC) = Cave painting in the Ignateva Cave in the Ural Mountains Hungarian has traditionally been classified as an Ugric language within the family of Uralic languages, but alternative views exist. For instance, linguist Tapani Salminen rejects the existence of a Proto-Ugric language, saying Hungarian was a member of an \\"areal genetic unit\\" that also included Permic languages. Paleolinguistic research suggests the speakers of the Proto-Uralic language lived in a territory where four treeslarch, silver fir, spruce, and elmgrew together. The study of pollen in fossils shows these trees could be found on both sides of the Ural Mountains along the rivers Ob, Pechora, and Kama in the . The land between the Urals and the Kama was sparsely inhabited during this period. From around , the Neolithic material culture of the wider region of the Urals spread over vast territories to the west and east. Regional variants emerged, showing the appearance of groups of people who had no close contact with each other. About 1000 basic words of the Hungarian languageincluding the names of the seasons and natural phenomena, and the most frequently used verbshad cognates in other Finno-Ugric languages, suggesting the temporary existence of a Proto-Finno-Ugric language. Between around 2600 and , climatic changes caused the spread of swamps on both sides of the Urals, forcing groups of inhabitants to leave their homelands. The Finno-Ugric linguistic unity disappeared and new languages emerged around . Whether the groups speaking the language from which Hungarian emerged lived to the east or to the west of the Urals in this period is debated by historians. Further climate changes occurring between 1300 and caused the northward expansion of the steppes by about , compelling the southernmost Ugric groups to adopt a nomadic lifestyle. Around , the climate again changed with the beginning of a wetter period, forcing the nomadic Ugric groups to start a southward migration, following the grasslands. Their movement separated them from the northern Ugric groups, which gave rise to the development of the language from which modern Hungarian emerged. According to historian L√°szl√≥ Kontler, the concept of the \\"sky-high tree\\" and some other elements of Hungarian folklore seem to have been inherited from the period of the Finno-Ugric unity. The melodies of the most common Hungarian funeral songs show similarities to tunes of Khanty epic songs. = Original homeland ( 800 BCbefore 600 AD) = A map depicting the theories of the Magyars' proposed Urheimats and their migrations The stag and the eagle, which are popular motifs of 10th-century Magyar art, have close analogies in Scythian art. The Scythians, Sarmatians, and other peoples who spoke Iranian languages dominated the Eurasian steppes between around and . During this period, all ethnic groups in the steppes were nomads with almost identical material cultures, for which the certain identification of the Magyars is impossible. Consequently, the location of their original homeland is subject to scholarly debates. R√≥na-Tas says the development of Hungarian started in the region of the rivers Kama and Volga, west of the Urals. Archaeologist Istv√°n Fodor writes that the original homeland lay to the east of the Urals. He says that some features of the tumuli erected at Chelyabinsk in the , including the northward orientation of the heads of the deceased and the geometric motifs on the clay vessels put in the graves, are similar to older burials that he attributes to Ugric peoples.  Migrations  = Early westward migrations (before 600 AD 750 or 830 AD) = A map depicting P√©ter Veres's theory of the Magyars' Urheimat and of their migrations, including their staying in the region of the Kuban River In the 1230s, Friar Julian went to search for the Magyars' legendary homeland Magna Hungaria after reading about it and a group of Magyars who had remained there in a Hungarian chronicle. He met a Hungarian-speaking group \\"beside the great Etil river\\" (the Volga or the Kama) in the land of the Volga Bulgars, in or in the wider region of present-day Bashkortostan in Eastern Europe. Whether Magna Hungaria was the original homeland of the Magyars, or whether the Magyars' ancestors settled in Magna Hungaria after their migration to Europe from their Western Siberian original homeland is still subject to scholarly debates. According to a third scholarly theory, Magna Hungaria was neither the Magyars' original homeland nor their first homeland in Europe. Instead, the ancestors of the Eastern Magyars whom Friar Julian met had moved to Magna Hungaria from the south. According to a scholarly theory, the name of at least one Magyar tribe, Gyarmat, is connected to the name of a Bashkir group, Yurmat√Ø. Specific burial ritesthe use of death masks and the placing of parts of horses into the gravesfeaturing a 9th- or 10th-century cemetery at the confluence of the Volga and Kama near present-day Bolshie Tigany in Bashkortostan are also evidenced among the Magyars who lived in the Carpathian Basin in the . Most specialists say that the cemetery at Bolshie Tigany was used by Magyars who either remained in Magna Hungaria when other Magyar groups left the territory, or who moved there from other regions which were inhabited by the Magyars during their migrations. If the Magyars' original homeland was situated in Western Siberia, instead of being identical with Magna Hungaria, their ancestors moved from Western Siberia to Eastern Europe. This must have happened between and , because there were several major movements of peoples across the steppes during this period. The \\"Prohorovo culture\\" spread towards modern-day Bashkortostan around . The westward migration of the Huns forced many groups of people of Western Siberia to depart for Europe between about 350 and . The Avars' attack against the Sabirs in Siberia set in motion a number of migrations in the 460s. Between around 550 and 600, the migration of the Avars towards Europe compelled many nomadic groups to move. The arrival of the Huns ended the dominance of Iranian peoples in the Eurasian steppes. Thereafter the Sabirs, Avars, Onoghurs, Khazars, and other Turkic peoples controlled the grasslands of Eastern Europe for centuries. Gardizi described the Magyars as \\"a branch of the Turks\\"; Leo the Wise and Constantine Porphyrogenitus called them Turks. About 450 Hungarian words were borrowed from Turkic languages before around 900. The oldest layer of Hungarian folk songs show similarities to Chuvash songs. These facts show the Magyars were closely connected to the Turks while they stayed in the Pontic steppes. Gyula N√©meth, Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas and other scholars write that for centuries, the Magyars lived around the Kuban River, to the north of the Caucasus Mountains. They say it was there that the Magyars adopted the Turkic terminology of viticulture, including bor (\\"wine\\") and sepr≈ë (\\"dregs\\"), and the Turkic names of cornel (som), grapes (sz≈ël≈ë) and some other fruits. According to these scholars, the Hungarian words of Alanic originincluding asszony (\\"lady\\", originally \\"noble or royal lady\\")were also borrowed in the same region. =Levedia ( 750 or 830 850)= The Khazar Khaganate around 830 The Khazar Khaganate was the dominant power in the steppes between the rivers Dnieper and Volga after around 650. Archaeological finds show that the Khagans controlled a multi-ethnic empire. The \\"Saltovo-Mayaki culture\\", which flourished in the same region around 750 and 900, had at least seven variants. In the Hungarian chronicles, the legend of the wondrous hind seems to have preserved the memory of the Magyars' \\"close symbiosis, intermarriages, and incipient fusion\\" with various ethnic groupsAlans, Bulgars, and Onogursof this large region. Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote that the Magyars \\"had of old their dwelling next to Chazaria, in the place called Levedia,\\"Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 38), p. 171. adding that \\"a river Chidmas, also called Chingilous\\" ran through this territory. The identification of the (one or two) rivers is uncertain. Porphyrogenitus associated Levedia with the whole territory dominated by the Magyars, but most modern historians agree that he only described a smaller region situated on the Don River. The period when the Magyars settled in Levedia is also uncertain; this happened either before 750 (Istv√°n Fodor) or around 830 (Gyula Krist√≥). Porphyrogenitus said that the Magyars had been named \\"Sabartoi asphaloi\\", or \\"steadfast Savarts\\", while staying in Levedia. R√≥na-Tas says the ethnonym is an invented term with no historical credibility. Based on the same denomination, K√°roly Czegl√©dy, Dezs≈ë D√ºmmerth, Victor Spinei, and other historians associated the Magyars either with the late 6th-century Sabirs or with the Suvar tribe of the Volga Bulgars. Porphyroneitus wrote that the Magyars \\"lived together with the Chazars for three years, and fought in alliance with the Chazars in all their wars\\", which suggests that the Magyars were subjugated to the Khazar Khagan, according to a scholarly view. On the other hand, historian Gy√∂rgy Szabados says, the emperor's words prove the equal position of the Magyars and the Khazars, instead of the Magyars' subjugation to the Khagan. Although the emperor said that the Magyars' cohabitation with the Khazars lasted only for three years, modern historians tend to propose a longer period (20, 30, 100, 150, 200 or even 300 years). According to a memorial stone erected in or before 831, a Bulgarian military commander named Okorsis drowned in the Dnieper during a military campaign. Florin Curta says this inscription may be the first clue' to the upheaval on the steppes created by the migration of the Magyars into the lands between the Dnieper and the Danube\\". The earliest certainly identifiable events of the Magyars' history occurred in the 830s. The Bulgarians hired them to fight against their Byzantine prisoners, who rebelled and tried to return to Macedonia in the late 830s, but the Byzantines routed them on the banks on the Lower Danube. According to the Annals of St. Bertin, Rus' envoys who visited Constantinople in 839 could only return to their homeland through the Carolingian Empire because \\"the route by which they had reached Constantinople had taken them through primitive tribes that were very fierce and savage\\";The Annals of St-Bertin (year 839), p. 44. Curta and Krist√≥ identify those tribes with the Magyars. Ibn Rusta wrote that the Khazars \\"used to be protected from attack by the Magyars and other neighboring peoples\\" by a ditch.Ibn Rusta on the Magyars, p. 122. According to a scholarly theory, Ibn Rusta's report shows that the Khazar fort at Sarkel, which was built in the 830s, was one of the forts protecting the Khazars against the Magyars. The \\"seven captains\\" of the Magyars depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle According to Porphyrogenitus, In Levedia, the Magyars \\"were seven clans, but they had never had over them a prince either native or foreign, but there were among them 'voivodes, or chiefs. Although the exact meaning of the term the emperor used (genea) cannot be exactly determined, scholars have traditionally considered the Magyar \\"clans\\" or \\"tribes\\" as ethnic and territorial units. In the Hungarian chronicles, references to \\"seven leading persons\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (Prologue), p. 3. or \\"seven captains\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 27), p. 98. denote the existence of seven Magyar tribes. Porphyrogenitus said the tribes did not \\"obey their own particular [voivodes], but [had] a joint agreement to fight together with all earnestness and wheresoever war breaks out\\",Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 40), p. 179. suggesting the tribal chiefs were military rather than political leaders. According to Krist√≥, the emperor's report also shows the tribal confederation was not a \\"solid political formation with strong cohesion\\" in the early 9th century. The Gesta Hungarorum referred to the seven Magyar chiefs as \\"Hetumoger\\", or \\"Seven Magyars\\". Similar ethnonymsincluding Toquz Oghuz (\\"Nine Oghuzes\\") and Onogur (\\"Ten Ogurs\\")suggest the Gesta preserved the name of the confederation of the Magyar tribes. According to Porphyrogenitus, Levedia was named after Levedi, one of the Magyar voivodes. During Levedi's life, the Kangars, a distinct group within the Pechenegs' tribal confederation whom the Khazars had expelled from their homeland, invaded Levedia and forced the Magyars to cede the territory. A Magyar group fled across the Caucasus Mountains as far as Persia. However, the masses departed for the West and settled in a region called Etelk√∂z. Most historians agree the Magyars' forced exodus from Levedia occurred around 850. =Etelk√∂z ( 850 895)= √Ålmos depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle: he was the first head of the federation of the Magyar tribes, according to the Hungarian chronicles Constantine Porphyrogenitus identified Etelk√∂z with the lands where the rivers \\"Barouch\\", \\"Koubou\\", \\"Troullos\\", \\"Broutos\\", and \\"Seretos\\"Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 38), p. 175. run. The identification of the last three rivers with the Dniester, the Prut, and the Siret is without debate, but the traditional identification of the Barouch with the Dnieper and the Koubou with the Southern Bug is refuted by Spinei. Al-Jayhani wrote that the Magyars' territory was located between two rivers named \\"tl\\" and \\"dwb\\" in the 870s. According to modern scholars, tl may refer to the Volga, the Don, or the Dnieper; dwb is identified as the Danube. According to the Gesta Hungarorum, the Magyars lived in \\"Scythia\\" or \\"Dentumoger\\";Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 1), p. 5. the latter name, which refers to the Don River, suggests the Magyars inhabited the eastern regions of the Pontic steppes, according to Spinei. The Khazar Khagan sent his envoys to the Magyars shortly after they fled from Levedia and settled in Etelk√∂z, according to Porphyrogenitus. The Khagan invited Levedi to a meeting, proposing to make Levedi the supreme head of the confederation of the Magyar tribes in exchange for the acceptance of his suzerainty. Instead of accepting the offer, Levedi suggested the new rank should be offered to another voivode, √Ålmos, or the latter's son, √Årp√°d. The Khagan accepted Levedi's proposal and upon his demand the Magyar chiefs proclaimed √Årp√°d their head. According to Krist√≥ and Spinei, Porphyrogenitus' report preserved the memory of the creation of a central office within the federation of the Magyar tribes. R√≥na-Tas says the story relates only a \\"change of dynasty\\"; the fall of Levedi's family and the emergence of the √Årp√°d dynasty. In contrast with Porphyrogenitus's story, the Gesta Hungarorum says it was not √Årp√°d, but his father who was elected the first supreme prince of the Magyars. According to Muslim scholars, the Magyars had two supreme leaders, the kende and the gyula, the latter being their ruler in the 870s. Their report implies the Khagan granted a Khazar title to the head of the federation of the Magyar tribes; Ibn Fadlan recorded that the third Khazar dignitary was styled k√ºnd√ºr in the 920s. The Muslim scholar's report also implies the Magyars adopted the Khazar system of \\"dual kingship\\", whereby supreme power was divided between a sacred ruler (the kende) and a military leader (the gyula). √Ålmos's son, √Årp√°d, depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle: he was the first head of the federation of the Magyar tribes, according to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus Porphyrogenitus wrote that the Kabarsa group of Khazars who rebelled against the Khaganjoined the Magyars in Etelk√∂z at an unspecified time, suggesting that the Magyars had got rid of the Khagan's suzerainty. The Kabars were organized into three tribes, but a single chieftain commanded them. Porphyrogenitus also wrote that the Kabars \\"were promoted to be first\\" tribe, because they showed themselves \\"the strongest and most valorous\\"Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 39), p. 175. of the tribes. Accordingly, the Kabars formed the Magyars' vanguard, because nomadic peoples always placed the associated tribes in the most vulnerable position. Ibn Rusta wrote that the Magyars subjected the neighboring Slavic peoples, imposing \\"a heavy tribute on them\\" and treating them as prisoners. The Magyars also \\"made piratical raids on the Slavs\\" and sold those captured during these raids to the Byzantines in Kerch on the Crimean peninsula. A band of Magyar warriors attacked the future Saint Cyril the Philosopher \\"howling like wolves and wishing to kill him\\"The Life of Constantine (ch.8), p. 45. in the steppes near the Crimea, according to the saint's legend. However, Cyril convinced them to \\"release him and his entire retinue in peace\\". The inhabitants of the regions along the left bank of the Dniesterwhom the Russian Primary Chronicle identified as Tivertsifortified their settlements in the second half of the 9th century, which seems to be connected to the Magyars' presence. A plundering raid in East Francia in 862 was the Magyars' first recorded military expedition in Central Europe. This raid may have been initiated by Rastislav of Moravia, who was at war with Louis the German, according to R√≥na- Tas and Spinei. The longer version of the Annals of Salzburg said the Magyars returned to East Francia and ransacked the region of Vienna in 881. The same source separately mentioned the Cowari, or Kabars, plundering the region of Kulmberg or Kollmitz in the same year, showing that the Kabars formed a distinct group. In the early 880s, a \\"king\\" of the Magyars had an amicable meeting with Methodius, Archbishop of Moravia, who was returning from Constantinople to Moravia, according to Methodius' legend. =The Hungarian Conquest ( 895907)= The Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin The Magyars returned to Central Europe in July 892, when they invaded Moravia in alliance with Arnulf, king of East Francia. Two years later, they stormed into the March of Pannonia. According to the Annals of Fulda, they \\"killed men and old women outright, and carried out the young women alone with them like cattle to satisfy their lusts\\".The Annals of Fulda (year 894), p. 129. Although this source does not refer to an alliance between the Magyars and Svatopluk I of Moravia, most historians agree the Moravian ruler persuaded them to invade East Francia. During their raids in the Carpathian Basin, the Magyars had several opportunities to collect information on their future homeland. The Samanid emir, Isma'il ibn Ahmad, launched an expedition against the Oghuz Turks in 893, forcing them to invade the Pechenegs' lands between the Volga and Ural rivers. After being expelled from their homeland, the Pechenegs departed for the west in search of new pastures. The Magyars had in the meantime invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise. Simeon I of Bulgaria sent envoys to the Pechenegs and persuaded them to storm into Etelk√∂z. The unexpected invasion destroyed the unguarded dwelling places of the Magyars, forcing them to leave the Pontic steppes and seek refuge over the Carpathian Mountains. The Magyars occupied their new homeland in several phases, initially settling the lands east of the Danube and only invading the March of Pannonia after Arnulf of East Francia died in 899. They destroyed Moravia before 906 and consolidated their control of the Carpathian Basin through their victory over a Bavarian army in the Battle of Brezalauspurc in 907.  Way of life  = Economy = Traditional Khanty fishing equipment Most Neolithic settlements were situated on the banks of rivers and lakes in the proposed original homeland of the Uralic peoples, but no houses have been excavated there. The local inhabitants primarily used tools made of stoneespecially jasper from the southern Urals, bone and wood, but baked clay vessels decorated with broken or wavy lines were also found. Their economy was based on fishing, hunting, and gathering. The basic Hungarian words connected to these activitiesh√°l√≥ (net), √≠j (bow), ny√≠l (arrow), ideg (bowstring), and mony (egg)are inherited from the Proto-Uralic period. The Hungarian words for house (h√°z), dwelling (lak), door (ajt√≥), and bed (√°gy) are of Proto-Finno-Ugric origin. Houses built in the presumed Finno- Ugric homeland in the wider region of the Urals in the show regional differences; in the valley of the Sosva River, square pit-houses were dug deep into the ground; along the Kama River, rectangular semi-pit houses were built. The local people were hunter-gatherers. They used egg-shaped, baked clay vessels that were decorated with rhombuses, triangles, and other geometrical forms. They buried their dead in shallow graves and showered the bodies with red ochre. They also placed objects including tools, jewels made of pierced boar tusks, and small pendants in the form of animal heads into the graves. Copper objects found in the graves, which were manufactured in the Caucasus Mountains, indicate that the inhabitants of the lands on both sides of the Ural Mountains had trading contacts with faraway territories around . Words from the Proto-Ugric periodl√≥ (\\"horse\\"), nyereg (\\"saddle\\"), f√©k (\\"bridle\\"), and szek√©r (\\"wagon\\")show that those who spoke this language rode horses. Animal husbandry spread on both sides of the Urals from around . The bones of domestic animalscattle, goats, sheep, pigs, and horsescomprised 90% of all animal bones excavated in many settlements. Loan words from Proto-Iranian suggest the Ugric-speaking populations adopted animal husbandry from neighboring peoples. For instance, the Hungarian words for cow (teh√©n) and milk (tej) are of Proto-Iranian origin. Archaeological findsincluding seeds of millet, wheat, and barley, and tools including sickles, hoes, and spade handlesprove the local population also cultivated arable lands. Szeged- Boj√°rhalom The Magyars' ancestors gave up their settled way of life because of the northward expansion of the steppes during the last centuries of the . Ethnographic studies of modern nomadic populations suggest cyclic migrationsa year-by-year movement between their winter and summer campsfeatured in their way of life, but they also cultivated arable lands around their winter camps. Most historians agree the Magyars had a mixed nomadic or semi-nomadic economy, characterized by both the raising of cattle and the cultivation of arable lands. Turkic loanwords in the Hungarian language show the Magyars adopted many practices of animal husbandry and agriculture from Turkic peoples between the . For instance, the Hungarian words for hen (ty√∫k), pig (diszn√≥), castrated hog (√°rt√°ny), bull (bika), ox (√∂k√∂r), calf (borj√∫), steer (tin√≥), female cow (√ºn≈ë), goat (kecske), camel (teve), ram (kos), buttermilk (√≠r√≥), shepherd's cloak (k√∂p√∂nyeg), badger (borz), fruit (gy√ºm√∂lcs), apple (alma), pear (k√∂rte), grape (sz≈ël≈ë), dogwood (som), sloe (k√∂k√©ny), wheat (b√∫za), barley (√°rpa), pea (bors√≥), hemp (kender), pepper (borz), nettle (csal√°n), garden (kert), plough (eke), ax (balta), scutcher (til√≥), oakum (csep≈±), weed (gyom), refuse of grain (ocs√∫), fallow land (tarl√≥), and sickle (sarl√≥) are of Turkic origin. Most loanwords were borrowed from Bulgar or other Chuvash-type Turkic language, but the place and the time of the borrowings are uncertain. The Magyars' connections with the people of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture may have contributed to the development of their agriculture, according to Spinei. According to Ibn Rusta, the late 9th-century Magyars \\"dwell in tents and move from place to place in search of pasturage\\", but during the winters they settled along the nearest river, where they lived by fishing. He also said their \\"land is well watered and harvests abundant\\", showing they had arable lands, although it is unclear whether those lands were cultivated by the Magyars themselves or by their prisoners. Taxes collected from the neighboring peoples, a slave trade, and plundering raids made the Magyars a wealthy people. Gardezi wrote that they were \\"a handsome people and of good appearance and their clothes are of silk brocade and their weapons are of silver and are encrusted with pearls\\", proving their growing wealth. However, 9th-century Byzantine and Muslim coins have rarely been found in the Pontic steppes. Archaeological finds from the Carpathian Basin provide evidence of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence the high levels of skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones. A man seeking a bride was expected to pay a bride price to her father before the marriage took place, according to Gardizi's description of the late 9th-century Magyars. The Hungarian word for bridegroomv≈ëleg√©ny from vev≈ë leg√©ny (\\"purchasing lad\\") and the expression elad√≥ l√°ny (verbatim, \\"bride for sale\\") confirm the reliability of the Muslim author's report. A decree of Stephen I of Hungary prohibiting the abduction of a girl without her parents' consent implies that pretended abduction of the bride by her future husband was an integral part of ancient Magyar matrimonial ceremonies. = Military = The Magyars' military tactics were similar to those of the Huns, Avars, Pechenegs, Mongols, and other nomadic peoples. According to Emperor Leo the Wise, the main components of Magyar warfare were long-distance arrow-fire, surprise attack, and feigned retreat. However, the contemporaneous Regino of Pr√ºm said the Magyars knew \\"nothing taking besieged cities\\".The Chronicle of Regino of Pr√ºm (year 889), p. 205. Archaeological research confirms Leo the Wise's report of the use of sabres, bows, and arrows. However, in contrast with the emperor's report, spears have rarely been found in Magyar warriors' tombs. Their most important weapons were bone-reinforced reflex bows, with which they could shoot at a specific target within . = Religion = Modern scholarly theories of the Magyars' pagan religious beliefs and practices are primarily based on reports by biased medieval authors and prohibitions enacted during the reigns of Christian kings. Both Christian and Muslim sources say the Magyars worshipped forces of nature. They gave offering to trees, fountains, and stones, and made sacrifices at wells; these are evidenced by the prohibition of such practices during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary in the late . In accordance with the custom of the peoples of the Eurasian steppes, the pagan Magyars swore oaths on dogs, which were bisected to warn potential oathbrakers of their fate. Simon of K√©za also wrote about the sacrifice of horses. According to the Gesta Hungarorum, the seven Magyar chiefs confirmed their treaty \\"in pagan manner with their own blood spilled in a single vessel\\". Scholars studying the Magyars' religion also take into account ethnographic analogies, folklore, linguistic evidence, and archaeological research. Artifacts depicting a bird of prey or a tree of life imply both symbols were important elements of the Magyar religion. Trepanationthe real or symbolic wounding of the craniumwas widely practiced by 10th-century Magyars. Gyula L√°szl√≥ writes that real trepanationsthe opening of the skull with a chiesel and the closing of the wound with a sheet of silverwere actually surgical operations similarly to those already practiced by Arab physicians, whereas symbolic trepanationsthe marking of the skull with an incised circlewere aimed at the disposal of a protective talisman on the head. According to R√≥na-Tas, a Hungarian word for cunning, (agyaf√∫rt)verbatim \\"with a drilled brain\\"may reflect these ancient practices. The Magyars buried their dead, laying the deceased on their backs with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior's tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master's grave, but occasionally only the harness was buried together with the warrior, or the horse's skin was stuffed with hay. The Magyars rolled the corpses in textiles or mats and placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth. Scholarly theories note the similarities between the t√°ltos of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans, but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including boszork√°ny (\\"witch\\"), elb≈±v√∂l (\\"to charm\\"), and the ancient Hungarian word for holy (igy or egy), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: b√∫cs√∫ (indulgence), b≈±n (sin), gy√≥n (confess), isten (god), and √∂rd√∂g (devil). According to Gyula L√°szl√≥, a Hungarian children's verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves the memory of a pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. The refrain of another children's verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief in the existence of an afterlife world where everything is upside-down.

It is considered the first settlement on the island of S√£o Jorge to attain the status of municipality; from 1510 to 1867 \\"Vila do Topo\\" was the municipal seat of Topo, which included the neighboring parish of Santo Ant√£o. The population in 2011 was 508,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 9.24 km¬≤.Eurostat History Solar dos Tiagos, burial place of Willem van der Haegen, Flemish settler and founder of the village of Topo Church of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, remodelled after the Mandado de Deus Debate still exists on whether Topo was the first settlement on the island; the first colony was founded between 1480 and 1490, when a colony of Flemish people, under the direction of Willem van der Haegen, settled on the eastern coast. This adventurous Fleming, who later adopted the name \\"Guilherme da Silveira\\", and whose descendants populate the numerous villages of S√£o Jorge, was later buried in the chapel-annex of the Solar dos Tiagos. Due to its proximity to Terceira, and owing to the difficult overland links to Calheta (over the Serra do Topo), the village was always more closely tied to Angra do Hero√≠smo: inter-marriage existed between both communities and the residents of Angra saw Topo as an extension of the city of Angra. This proximity is visible in similar architectural styles, which are different then the other communities of S√£o Jorge. Until the middle of the 20th century, port of Topo was a referential point in the maritime connection with Terceira due to its location. Although this coast was punctuated by steep cliffs, a staircase to the Cais velho and successive remodelling (between 1560 and 1637) allowed access to the village by sea. The port, and its access to Terceira, was so important that after the villages annexation by Calheta, the construction of the first lighthouse was deliberated in favour of Topo. Due to its population growth, the community was elevated to the status of village on September 12, 1510, transforming itself into one of the Captaincies of the island. Unfortunately, its further growth was curtailed by its limited hinterland, which would not allow further expansion economically. In fact, the village of Topo, until the middle of the 20th century did not have an adequate overland link to the rest of the island, and relied on its port. In the October 24, 1855 rationalization of the administrative divisions of the Azores, the municipality of Topo was disincorporated and merged into the administration of the municipality of Calheta (on April 1, 1870)Popular protests against the annexation by Calheta began in 1867, after the final document was promulgated, and discontent persisted for many years afterwards. Although its title of \\"village\\" was removed, the community retained is urban distinction, with many community roadways and architecturally distinct buildings absent in the rest of the archipelago. For this reason, the community still took on the veneer of a \\"village\\", whose loss was never really accepted by the population. Realizing these circumstances, a decree of the Regional Legislature (n.¬∫ 29/2003/A) devolved and re-established the village's classification as village on June 24, 2003, making Topo the official third village on the island.http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2003/06/143A00/36273629.PDF - Decreto Legislativo Regional n.o 29/2003/A The village has been devastated by the locally-known Mandado de Deus (\\"Sent by God\\") earthquake, which occurred on July 9, 1757, as well as the more recent January 1, 1980 earthquake, causing the destruction and instability of many homes. The primitive church, dating back to the 16th century, was destroyed during the event. It was reconstructed under the guidance of Father Matias Pereira de Sousa, and directed by Jos√© de Avelar de Melo, concluding in 1761: in two mass graves around the church, 84 victims of the Mandado de Deus were buried. During the whaling era, in the middle of the 19th century, the port of Topo was the first on the island to support and replenish whalers; the first company was founded in 1885. The boats were guarded in dug-out caves along the southern cliffs. Topo was also destroyed in 1980, during an earthquake that caused the forced emigration of many of its residence, and responsible for the death of 11 and the disappearance of 9 others. The movement of several tonnes of rock and debris in the north, forced the abandonment of many lands in the northern coast. From a population of 2000 inhabitants the local community fell to 500 residents in a process of rapid depopulation that has not concluded. The decision, in 1997, to transform the old Franciscan Convent of S√£o Diogo into a primary school. With this change the village has been able to stabilize the current population, and attract new functions, including: a Sports Pavilion, cantina, laboratories and public library. Similarly, by 1970 many yachts and sail boats used Topo as a stopover on trans-Atlantic and inter-island voyages. Geography =Physical geography= The dividing range of Serra do Topo and Cume dos Arrebent√µes, that separates Topo from the rest of S√£o Jorge A view from the Topo Lookout, showing the beginning of the village The village of Topo is located in the extreme southeast of the island of S√£o Jorge, on a relatively planar terrain with a gentle slope that begins at Ponta do Topo and extends to the parish of Santo Ant√£o, separated from the rest of the island by rugged Serra do Topo. In addition to Cume dos Arrebent√µes, Topo is the location of several volcanic peaks formed during the geological timeline, including The fertile plain in this area is known for the cultivation of wheat: the unique area in the Azores to still produce the crop annually. The Serra do Arrebent√£o, its various peaks (such as Pico do Facho, Pico das Rocas, Pico dos Frades and Pico da Pedra Vermelha), the northern coastal cliffs and the Grota das Pedras Brancas river-valley has made sea access historically more important than overland trails.

Life Vagn Holmboe was born in Horsens, Jutland, into a merchant family of dedicated amateur musicians. Both parents played the piano. His father earned his living as a maker of colours and lacquers at Horsens . The Danish journalist Knud Holmboe was his elder brother. From the age of 14 Vagn Holmboe took violin lessons. In 1926, at the age of 16, he began formal music training at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen on the recommendation of Carl Nielsen. He studied under Knud Jeppesen (theory) and Finn H√∏ffding (composition). After finishing his studies in 1929 he moved to Berlin where for a short period Ernst Toch became his teacher . During his time in the German capital he met the Romanian-born pianist and visual artist Meta May Graf (1910‚Äì2003) from Sibiu/Hermannstadt. She had studied at the Musikhochschule Berlin since 1929, with Paul Hindemith as one of her teachers . The couple married in 1933 and left Berlin for Romania, where they visited obscure and remote villages and studied Transylvanian folk-song . Subsequently, they moved to Denmark, settling in the capital, Copenhagen, in 1934. While his wife Meta gave up her musical career to pursue her passions in the visual arts, photography in particular, Vagn gave music lessons privately and began composing during this period. Many of the early compositions have never been performed. Similar to the research he had already done in Romania, he pursued his studies of folk-song with much field-work throughout Denmark including the Faroes and Greenland. Many overtly folk-linked compositions, including the Inuit Songs, are a result of these activities. From 1941 to 1949 he was a teacher at the Royal Institute for the Blind, and from 1950 to 1965 he taught at the Royal Conservatory in Copenhagen, being appointed a Professor there in 1955. Prior to that he had also worked as a music critic for the Danish daily Politiken from 1947 to 1955 . Vagn Holmboe's students included Per N√∏rg√•rd, Ib N√∏rholm, Bent Lorentzen, Arne Nordheim, Egil Hovland and Alan Stout. Vagn and his wife Meta had bought a piece of land at Lake Arres√∏ in Raml√∏se/Zealand in 1940, where they set up a farm, \\"Arre Boreale\\" (Latin for Northern Arres√∏), in the 1950s and spent the rest of their lives together there . Vagn Holmboe was a keen nature-lover, who lived in the countryside until his death in 1996 and over the years personally planted 3000 trees on his land . Music Holmboe composed about 370 works, including 13 symphonies, three chamber symphonies, four symphonies for strings, 20 string quartets, numerous concertos, one opera, and the late series of preludes for chamber orchestra, as well as much choral and other music, in addition to some early works that never received opus numbers. His last work, the 21st string quartet, Quartetto sereno, was completed by his pupil Per N√∏rg√•rd. Musical metamorphosis of thematic or motivic fragments characterize most of his works between the years 1950 and 1970; in this regard his music is similar to that written by Jean Sibelius earlier in the twentieth century. His earlier works show the influence of East European composers such as B√©la Bart√≥k; his work also shows the influence of Igor Stravinsky, Carl Nielsen and Dmitri Shostakovich.

It is located near Birmingham Airport and the National Exhibition Centre. It lies about eight miles east of Birmingham City Centre and 5 miles to the north of Solihull town centre. In 1966 Birmingham City Council compulsorily purchased the ancient woodland and built the 15,590 dwelling council estate to rehouse families on its council house waiting list. With the rise in unemployment in the 1970s parts of the estate suffered from deprivation and anti-social behaviour. Local government re-organisation in 1974 transferred the area to Solihull Metropolitan Borough, though responsibility for the housing remained with Birmingham until September 1980. The boundaries of Chelmsley Wood have changed since its inception as neighbouring districts have merger and areas within the plan have become independent settlements. The estate itself, now known as North Solihull, is being renovated and extended.  History  OS map of Chelmsley Wood in 1887, before the area was built on Chelmsley Wood is a relatively new area, which was built by Birmingham City Council in the late 1960s and early 70s on ancient woodland, once part of the Forest of Arden, as an overspill town for Birmingham. Permission for the construction of the overspill estate on green belt land was granted by Richard Crossman as Minister of Housing and Local Government. A shopping centre (which opened on 7 April 1970), a library (completed in 1970 at ¬£240,000), hall and belatedly a few public houses. With the adjoining neighbourhoods of Fordbridge and Smith's Wood it became part of Metropolitan Borough of Solihull in 1974. By the end of the Second World War 12,391 homes had been destroyed by aerial bombing in Birmingham and there was to be no house building in the city for six years so the programme of slum clearance had been halted. By the 1950s there were terrific demand for homes. Large estates were built within the city boundaries such as Druid's Heath, Castle Vale and at Bromford on the site of the city‚Äôs former racecourse, but by 1963 there was no further land available within the city boundaries. The city council had powers under the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1900 to purchase land out-of- area. On 21 December 1964, Richard Crossman the new minister for housing sent a letter to Sir Frank Price, leader of Birmingham City Council proposing the scheme. The population was increasing and it was estimated that there would be a deficiency of 43,000 dwellings by 1971, which would have been worse than it had been in 1959. At a meeting of the House Building Committee in February 1965, it was decided to build a large new development to the east of the city. Objections were raised about the scheme, particularly from Meriden Rural District Council and the local Parish Councils, on grounds of amenity and the threat to the green belt separating Birmingham and Coventry. A similar application for the use of nearly 300 acres at Wythall to the south of Birmingham was considered, but this was turned down. Permission was granted. =\\"The Wood\\"= Land was compulsorily purchased and construction of the 15,590 dwellings was begun in 1965 and completed in 1970. Although the area became part of Solihull in 1974, Birmingham City Council retained control of their houses until they were officially transferred to Solihull MBC on 29 September 1980. Construction started in 1965 and the first rates were levied on houses in Oak Croft on 6 March 1967. Such was the scale of the operation that a development company was to design finance and build a complete town centre which was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 April 1972. The \\"Wood\\" was to be 80% public housing and 18% privately developed homes, houses were reserved for 100 policemen and rows of terraced homes were let out or sold at a reduced rate to key workers: nurses, social workers and teachers working on the estate. The \\"Wood\\" had considerable thought put into its planning and won architectural awards for its landscaping. It was provided with schools, a library and shopping areas, but in the early days there was no local pub, the nearest one being reached by a five-mile bus journey.The \\"unity and harmony\\" of the design made it appear monotonous rather than modern. Etymology The name \\"Chelmsley\\" is of considerable antiquity. It indicates a settlement of Saxon origin ‚Äì the enclosure of Ceolmund. Ceolmund Crescent is the name of the road that passes by the police station, and the Post Office Tower in the town centre. The word \\"Ceolmund\\" itself comes from the Old English Ceol \\"Keel\\" (of a ship) and Mund \\"Protection\\". Concept and Design flats are abundant in the estate There were the 15,590 dwellings (including 39 multi-storey blocks of flats). There were 70 shop units and 6 major stores, as well as a 4-storey office block and 2 pubs. The 221 dwellings in the town centre included 14 maisonettes over shops. It was laid out in a Radburn style with houses opening out onto pedestrian pathways and open green space, and backing onto the vehicular access. To enhance the openness, there were no fences between gardens and public space. =Tower blocks= With the 6 adjoining estates, which over half a century have merged, there were 51 tower blocks until the late 1990s, in the complex. As of 2015 there are approximately 42 tower blocks left across the estates. ;Chelmsley group - 12 tower blocks *Richmond House, off Marlene Croft, buil 1967 using the Bison system- 11 storeys *Trevelyan House, off Marlene Croft, built 1967 using the Bison system - 11 storeys *Chester Court, aka Hatfield House, off Dunster Rd, built 1967 using the Bison system- 10 storeys *Warwick Court, aka Bede House, of Dunster Rd, built 1967 using the Bison system- 10 storeys *Downing House, off Willow Way, built 1967 using the Bison system- 9 storeys *Darwin House, off Alder Dr, built 1967 using the Bison system- 9 storeys *Kingsgate House, off Winchester Dr (Area 3), built 1968 by Wimpey- 11 storeys *Avoncroft House, off Winchester Dr (Area 3), built 1968 by Wimpey- 11 storeys *Fircroft House, off Winchester Dr (Area 3), built 1968 by Wimpey- 11 storeys *Woodbrook House, off Hedgetree Croft/ Larch Croft, built 1968 using the Bison system- 13 storeys *Dillington House, off Moorend Av/ Town Centre, built 1968 using the Bison system - 10 storeys *Chestnut House, off Moorend Av/ Town Centre, built 1968 Transport Marston Green train station National Express West Midlands operate a number of buses in and around the Chelmsley Wood area. Chelmsley Wood shopping centre has a bus interchange which hosts buses that go to and from Birmingham city centre, Solihull town centre, Coleshill, Warwickshire, Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham Airport. In Summer 2017, National Express West Midlands extensively rerouted and retimed all of their bus routes that run to/from Chelmsley Wood. The closest railway station is at Marston Green which is about a mile (1.75 km) from Chelmsley Wood Shopping Centre. From there, there are trains to Coventry, Birmingham Airport, Birmingham City Centre and The National Exhibition Centre. Leisure North Solihull Sports Centre is the largest and most used sports centre in Chelmsley Wood and its surrounding areas. It hosts two swimming pools, a sports hall, a fitness suite, studio, cr√®che and caf√© bar. It also hosts an outdoor running track, and an astroturf pitch.  Recent development  The area has for decades had a negative reputation due to being associated with anti-social behaviour and crime, although the estate has been relatively successful compared to other similar estates across England. The area is currently undergoing the biggest redevelopment project in its history. So far, a new large supermarket and a new library have been built, new schools have been built, many of the most run down properties have been demolished, especially in the Craig Croft area, a new village centre is under construction and all of the remaining tower blocks have been reclad.  Demographics  Politically, Chelmsley Wood is represented by three councillors on Solihull Council. Voters had historically been known for their strong support of Labour candidates at both local and national elections. However, in the 2006 election, the Chelmsley Wood ward elected a candidate from the British National Party, the first in Solihull's history. The elected candidate won by a margin of 19 votes. In the 2010 election the seat went back to Labour after George Morgan stood down with the BNP vote falling dramatically and the Green Party finishing second to Labour by 22 votes. Since 2011, Chelmsley Wood residents have elected Green Party councillors to serve them at every election, voting in Karl Macnaughton (2011), Chris Williams (2012) and James Burn (2014). Karl Macnaughton was re-elected in the 2015 elections with over 68% of the vote, and Chris Williams in 2016 with 75%.

With a population of 5396 inhabitants in 2011,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica the parish covers an area of approximately that extends from the southern coast of the island.Eurostat It contains the localities Atalhada, Bairro das Socas, Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, Porto dos Carneiros and Vila Mar. History Front facade of the parochial church of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio in the centre of the city of Lagoa Ros√°rio was originally part of the neighboring parish of Santa Cruz, but quickly its population and socio-political importance grew, requiring an administrative solution. Local historians suggest that may have been one of the first villas to be settled on the island of S√£o Miguel, although there is little record to support this assertion. The settlement was elevated to the status of vila on 22 April 1522, under the religious parish of Santa Cruz; half a decade later, the continued growth of the settlement necessitated the establishment of a secondary faith community concentrated on the parochial church of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, thus justifying its creation on 5 April 1595. In his public work Memorial da Lagoa e do seu Concelho (\\"Memory of Lagoa and its Municipality\\"), Carreiro da Costa wrote: :\\"There is a decree that is known by the studious, and it is a valuable document about the beginning of settlement in our islands. It is a decree during the age of minority of that monarch (Afonso V), dated 2 od July 1439, where the Infante D. Henrique is authorized to send to the first seven islands of the Azores, at the time discovered, the first families, when years before there were scattered some head of cattle.\\" It was this note, that the coastal areas of S√£o Miguel that justified the assertion that the area in which the present villa is located pertained to the first settlers in the Azores. These first settlers encountered prodigious herds of sheep and goats, and in particular rams when they arrived in the bay of Lagoa. Consequently, the cove was named Porto dos Carneiros (\\"carneiros\\" meaning \\"rams\\" in Portuguese). In the middle of the 15th Century, there existed in this settlement four religious temples, one of which was the Church of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio. This church was expanded progressively, as the community grew, and between 1583-1586, it began to serve as the villas central church, while the Church of Santa Cruz was being remodeled. Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio was constructed over an older chapel of the same name that had existed since the 16th Century. The 17th Century church, in larger dimensions, has three naves and notable group of sculptures by the artist Machado de Castro. The municipal council of Lagoa promoted a ceremony to honour the diverse personalities from the parish to mark the 417 anniversary of the elevation of the community to civil parish status. Geography The parish is situated along the southern maritime coast, between Santa Cruz and Ponta Delgada, and extends along coast and into the interior. Two main vias intersect the parish and divide the parish into quarters, along north-south and west-east segments of the regional E.R.1-1¬™ roadway. To the south is the older arm of the coastal road that connects the city to Ponta Delgada and Vila Franca do Campo. The border follows the Grota do Porto ravine, north to the border with Cabouco (along Rua das Arrudas), then west to the beginning of Caminho do Malaca, following this road to Malacca de Cima. Crossing the Via-R√°pida (North-South), the frontier follows the Estrada dos Port√µes Vermelhos until the E.R.7 roadway, when it descends along Canada das Socas, then Canada Santa to the Barrio of Socas and the west-east segment of the Via-R√°pida. From this freeway the border follows the Canada Nova do P√≥pulo, then Rua Padre Domingos da Silva Costa, before bisecting towards the coast through the property of Prolacto- Nestl√© factory. To the west, alongside the Via-Rapida, is the industrial zone of the city of Lagoa, to the north the main modern residential community, while to the interior are landscapes of walled agricultural lands and forest woodlots. Economy Expolab, one the main businesses in the Parque Tecnologico da Lagoa Ros√°rio is an industrial center in the region, the location of several large and artisanal businesses that produce oils, animal feed, soap, services that include carpentry, metallurgy, saw mills, as well as the sale of alcohol, ceramics, paints. Further, the agricultural production of milk and milk products (specifically cheese and butter), commercial fishery and hotel service sectors are also important in the area.

In early days the Seafair Pirates' triumph often included the burning of Neptune's flagship, complete with fire-works. That stopped when the supply of derelict ships became depleted. The Seafair Pirates are led by Captain Kidd and Davy Jones. Captain Kidd is elected by the Ale & Quail Society to lead their pirate operations. Davy Jones, an honorary Seafair Pirate, is chosen from the Seattle community to sail with the Pirates for one year. Always seeking to promote Seattle and Seafair, the Seafair Pirates have had many adventures over the years. According to the Pirates' website, in 1953 the Seafair Pirates heard of a fund that had been established to ransom British subjects captured by pirates. By then the fund was worth well over a million dollars. In an attempt to collect this treasure the Seafair Pirates \\"kidnapped\\" the British consul and vice-consul, informing the government of Britain that the pirates of old were still in business. While they were mentioned in The Times (of London), they did not receive any payment. Pirate ships The Moby Duck The Seafair Pirates command two ships. The Moby Duck is a former DUKW from World War II which has been highly modified to resemble an old Spanish galleon. The Moby Duck has a siren in the front to warn the ladies and children of their approach. There are also real cannons to ward off those who might give chase. The Moby Duck was formerly amphibious but now sails only on dry land.Seattle Seafair Pirates Moby Duck In 2006, the pirates acquired themselves a hydroplane, the U-37, better known as the Miss Seattle. The boat had a previous existence as the U-8 Llumar Window Film, and has won the 2005 Seafair Chevrolet Cup (and two other races outside Seattle) and also won the 2006 Seafair Cheverolet Cup. Jean Theoret will continue to pilot the boat in races. The boat's official owner is Billy Schumacher, a boat racing celebrity.

Barraclough, Steelmaking 1850-1900 (Institute of Metals, London 1990), 137-203. Since steel is difficult to manufacture due to its high melting point, normal fuels and furnaces were insufficient and the open hearth furnace was developed to overcome this difficulty. Compared to Bessemer steel, which it displaced, its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), was easier to control, and it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap iron and steel. The open hearth furnace was first developed by German-born engineer Carl Wilhelm Siemens. In 1865, the French engineer Pierre-√âmile Martin took out a license from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. Their process was known as the Siemens‚ÄìMartin process, and the furnace as an \\"open-hearth\\" furnace. Most open hearth furnaces were closed by the early 1990s, not least because of their slow operation, being replaced by the basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace.Philippe Mioche, ¬´ Et l'acier cr√©a l'Europe ¬ª, Mat√©riaux pour l'histoire de notre temps, vol. 47, 1997, p. 29-36 Whereas the earliest example of open hearth steelmaking is found about 2000 years ago in the culture of the Haya people, in present day Tanzania, and in Europe in the Catalan forge, invented in Spain in the 8th century, it is usual to confine the term to certain 19th-century and later steelmaking processes, thus excluding bloomeries (including the Catalan forge), finery forges, and puddling furnaces from its application. Open hearth process The open hearth process is a batch process and a batch is called a \\"heat\\". The furnace is first inspected for possible damage. Once it is ready or repaired, it is charged with light scrap, such as sheet metal, shredded vehicles or waste metal. The furnace is heated using burning gas. Once the charge has melted, heavy scrap, such as building, construction or steel milling scrap is added, together with pig iron from blast furnaces. Once all the steel has melted, slag-forming agents such as limestone are added. The oxygen in iron oxide and other impurities decarburizes the pig iron by burning excess carbon away, forming steel. To increase the oxygen content of the heat, iron ore can be added.A Study of the Open Hearth: A Treatise on the Open Hearth Furnace and the Manufacture of Open Hearth Steel. Harbison-Walker Refractories Company. (2015), 102 pag, , The process is far slower than that of the Bessemer converter and thus easier to control and sample for quality assessment. Preparing a heat usually takes eight to eight and a half hours, and (more) hours to finish the conversion into steel. As the process is slow, it is not necessary to burn all the carbon away as in the Bessemer process, but the process can be terminated at any given point when the desired carbon content has been achieved. The furnace is tapped in the same way a blast furnace is tapped; a hole is drilled in the side of the hearth and the raw steel flows out. Once all the steel has been tapped, the slag is skimmed away. The raw steel may be cast into ingots, a process called teeming, or it may be used in continuous casting in the rolling mill. The regenerators are the distinctive feature of the furnace and consist of fire-brick flues filled with bricks set on edge and arranged in such a way as to have a great number of small passages between them. The bricks absorb most of the heat from the outgoing waste gases and return it later to the incoming cold gases for combustion. History Tapping open hearth furnace, Fagersta steelmill, Sweden, 1967. Sir Carl Wilhelm Siemens developed the Siemens regenerative furnace in the 1850s, and claimed in 1857 to be recovering enough heat to save 70‚Äì80% of the fuel. This furnace operates at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it for that.Basic Open Hearth Steelmaking, with Supplement on Oxygen in Steelmaking, third edition (The Seely W. Mudd Series) The American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (1964). Gerhard, Derge. ASIN B00IJLRL40. In 1865, the French engineer Pierre-√âmile Martin took out a license from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. The most appealing characteristic of the Siemens regenerative furnace is the rapid production of large quantities of basic steel, used for example to construct high-rise buildings. The usual size of furnaces is 50 to 100 tons, but for some special processes they may have a capacity of 250 or even 500 tons. Siemensmartin12nb.jpgSiemens furnace from 1895.

Open hearth furnace size evolution sketch.svglang=enEvolution of the size of open hearth furnaces. The Siemens‚ÄìMartin process complemented rather than replaced the Bessemer process. It is slower and thus easier to control. It also permits the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap steel, further lowering steel production costs and recycling an otherwise troublesome waste material. Its worst drawback is that melting and refining a charge takes several hours. This was an advantage in the early 20th century, as it gave plant chemists time to analyze the steel and decide how much longer to refine it. But by about 1975, electronic instruments such as atomic absorption spectrophotometers had made analysis of the steel much easier and faster. The work environment around an open-hearth furnace is said to be extremely dangerous, although that may be even more true of the environment around a basic oxygen or electric arc furnace. Basic oxygen steelmaking eventually replaced the open hearth furnace. It rapidly superseded both the Bessemer and Siemens‚ÄìMartin processes in western Europe by the 1950s and in eastern Europe by the 1980s. The open hearth steelmaking had superseded the Bessemer process in UK by 1900, but elsewhere in Europe, especially in Germany, the Bessemer and Thomas processes were used until the late 1960s when they were superseded by basic oxygen steelmaking. The last open-hearth furnace in the former East Germany was stopped in 1993. In the US, steel production using the Bessemer process ended in 1968 and the open-hearth furnaces had stopped by 1992. In Hunedoara steel works, Romania the last 420-tonne capacity open-hearth furnace was shut down on 12 June 1999 and demolished and scrapped between 2001 and 2003, but the eight smokestacks of the furnaces remained until February 2011. The last open-hearth shop in China was shut down in 2001. The nation with the highest share of steel produced with open-hearth furnaces (almost 50%) is Ukraine. The process is still in use in India and some parts of Ukraine. Russia retired its last hearth furnace in March 2018, and was considering preserving it as a museum artifact.

The population in 2011 was 11,521,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 111.50 km2.Eurostat History A historical image of the rocky beach of Calhau da Calheta, as workers transport barrels of Madeira wine for shipment The origin of the areas name, are both related to the toponymy of Calheta (which means \\"small bay\\" in Portuguese): first, that there existed a small bay or cove, which already had this name, but secondly, that the area of the settlement was the off-port for sugar and collection of wood. Calheta was founded in 1430; the parish, of the same name (which is the central part of the municipality) is one of the oldest parishes on the island of Madeira, and one of the first to be explored by the early settlers. It was the area selected by Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco (the island's discoverer) as a grant to his son and his wife, Jo√£o Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara and Beatriz Gon√ßalves. The village became a town 72 years after its foundation, on 1 July 1502, after a royal foral (charter) was granted by King Manuel I. The region was primarily settled by noblemen and knights, influencing the toponymic names that appeared in many of its localities: such as Lombo do Doutor and Lombo do Atouguia. In 1502, Jo√£o de Fran√ßa constructed the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa (), which was to be the basis for the new parish of Calheta, founding the first and oldest institutions of the parish. Similarly, the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia was established in 1535, to serve the elderly and provide healthcare for the local residents. The parish of Prazeres, which was an ecclesiastical component of Estreito da Calheta was dismembered in 1733, becoming an autonomous clergy on 12 November (which was later followed by the first cornerstone of the Church of Prazeres, in 1751). The Liberal revolution resulted in the incorporation of Calheta as municipality in 1835. Similarly, the parish of Ponta do Pargo, after several years being part of the municipality of Porto Moniz (between 1835 and 1849), began to function as an administrative unit of the municipality of Calheta after the latter municipal seat was disincorporated. The restoration of Porto Moniz in 1855, resulted in the parishes reincorporation within the borders of Porto Moniz. By law, on 26 June 1871, was reintegrated into Ponta do Pargo. Trist√£o Vaz Teixeira Bettencourt da C√¢mara, was granted the title of Baron of Jardim do Mar: his was a proprietor and later the director of the Di√°rio de Not√≠cias in Funchal. In one of the last events of the monarchy of Portugal affecting Calheta, King Carlos I of Portugal and Queen Am√©lie of Orl√©ans visited the village of Calheta, travelling to Raba√ßal, during their trip to Madeira. On 5 June 1922, the lighthouse in Ponta da Vigia, Ponta do Pargo was inaugurated to protect the western coast of the island. The Bairro Piscat√≥rio do Paul do Mar (a block of homes destined for peoples involved in the fishery) were inaugurated in July 1944. Geography Paul da Serra, the northern extent of the municipality of Calheta The manufactured coastal beach of Calheta: replacing the dark rock/sand of the volcanic island with beach sand for tourism =Physical geography= Calheta is located west of Santana, Machico and Funchal, along the southern roadway. Even from its position Saharan Desert sands are able to occasionally affect the area, producing minor dust clouds. =Human geography= For statistical and administrative reasons, it is referred to as Vila da Calheta to avoid confusion with other Calhetas in Portugal, such as Calheta in the Azores. The municipality includes eight administrative parishes that handle local affairs, representing individual communities along the roadways of the municipality: * Arco da Calheta * Calheta * Estreito da Calheta * Faj√£ da Ovelha * Jardim do Mar * Pa√∫l do Mar * Ponta do Pargo * Prazeres Calheta, the parish, had a population of 3,163 (2011), within an administrative area of 23.45 km2. Economy Agriculture and the fishery provides the primary sources of income in this area, although minor commercial establishments are concentrated in the principal village in the municipality. Agriculture was the first industry to develop in this region; the production/cultivation of banana, wine, horticulture and sugar cane developed as the main export products. The fishery supported the populations of Pa√∫l do Mar and the vila of Calheta, although fishermen existed throughout the municipality. Industrial activity has changed throughout the region, and has developed through cycles, including the dairy industry, fireworks, salt, beekeeping and sugar cane refinement, which have all undergone peaks and troughs. Of these, for example, the factory/ironworks used for conversion of honey into aguardente, a distilled spirit common in the village of Calheta and the fireworks buildings in the Lombo do Doutor were integral businesses in the municipalities development. Education While the communities of Calheta do have two secondary schools (EBSC and EBSP), higher education facilities are located in Funchal. There are four main primary schools offering instruction for children: EB1 Ladeira e Lamaceiros and EB1 Lombo do Guin√© (both in Arco da Calheta), EB1 Lombo do Atouguia and EB1 Calheta, EB1 Estreito da Calheta, as well as the kindergarten, JI Apresenta√ß√£o da Estrela run by catholic nuns (in Calheta). In the parish of Ponta do Pargo, Maria Am√©lia de Sousa, provided educational instruction, at the primary level, for many of the children of the western coast of Calheta, lasting 70 years. This formalized education was unique for including children of both sexes. The municipal council has also been active in providing ancillary services to support the community, through the remodelling of many playgrounds (two of which include official football fields, in Prazeres and Paul do Mar) and a swimming pool by the EBSC.

Christian military orders A preceptor was historically in charge of a preceptory, the headquarters of certain orders of monastic knights, such as the Knights Hospitaller and Knights Templar, within a given geographical area.Zsolt Hunyadi, J√≥zsef Laszlovszky, The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity (Budapest, 2001), pp. 235, 270 The preceptor had supreme control of his brethren and was only answerable to the grand master of his particular order. A preceptory's main focus would be its church and accommodation for the brethren. Examples include the Hospitaller Torphichen Preceptory in West Lothian, Scotland; West Peckham Preceptory in West Peckham, England and the Templar Aslackby Preceptory in Lincolnshire, Keele Preceptory in Staffordshire and Temple, Midlothian. Freemasonry Within modern-day Freemasonry the preceptor is the head of a lodge of instruction.Arthur Edward Waite, A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Volume 1 (New York: Cosimo, 2007), p. xxi Such lodges operate within a geographical area and provide training in the performance of the order's ritual for members of the order. The preceptor is an elected position and is usually a Freemason who has spent several years as a director of ceremonies in his local lodge and is considered an expert in the ritual of the order. In English Freemasonry, the Preceptor of the lodge is usually appointed by the Master. His main responsibility is to prompt those masons who have forgotten their words. Some lodges, and some preceptors, take his theoretical status as a teacher more seriously than others. Music Musically, the title preceptor usually refers to a monk responsible for making music in a monastery. He trained the monks in the traditions of plainchant for daily services and prayers. Education Some North American universities have a special student position called preceptor. Preceptors are student volunteers who assist the staff professor and teaching assistants of a large lecture class by helping design certain lessons and holding his or her own office hours and review sessions. In some cases, volunteers are required to take an outside class focused on leadership development, where the final grade is determined by both the lecture professor and leadership development teacher. Thus, the preceptor earns credit for his or her preceptorship. It is considered a good leadership experience and reflects well on the student in his or her transcript. Preceptor can also refer to a paid student grader. At some universities, including Harvard, Cambridge and Oxford, \\"preceptors\\" are not students at all but faculty members teaching courses in writing, music, mathematics, languages, and the life sciences. In some departments they are not tenured faculty but rather non-ladder faculty (generally PhDs) who help administer and run the course, especially with the larger ones. Harvard preceptors, who teach introductory writing, have included New Yorker staff writer George Packer, novelist Tom Perrotta, former Globe music critic Richard Dyer and poet Dan Chiasson. At Columbia University, on the other hand, \\"preceptors\\" are senior graduate students who, along with senior faculty, teach courses on \\"Literature Humanities\\" and \\"Contemporary Civilization\\". The title is also used to refer to teaching assistants at Princeton, who are typically graduate students. At Elon University School of Law, a preceptor is an attorney who mentors two or three first-year law students. Health In medicine, allied health, midwifery, paramedicine, pharmacy and nursing education, a preceptor is a skilled practitioner or faculty member who supervises students in a clinical setting to allow practical experience with patients.Florence Myrick, Olive Yonge, Nursing Preceptorship: Connecting Practice and Education (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005), p. 4  References  Category:Occupations in music Category:Titles ","title":"Preceptor"},{"id":"1143053","text":"The KS-23 is a Soviet shotgun, although because it uses a rifled barrel it is officially designated by the Russian military as a carbine. KS stands for Karabin Spetsialniy, \\"Special Carbine\\". It is renowned for its large caliber, firing a 23 mm round, equating to 6.27 gauge using the British and American standards of shotgun gauges and approximately 4 gauge using the current European standards (based on the metric CIP tables), making it the largest- bore shotgun in use today. History The KS-23 was designed in the 1970s for suppressing prison riots. It was created by TsNIITochMash, a key Soviet weapons developer, for the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). The barrel for the KS-23 were made from 23 mm aircraft gun barrels that were rejected due to manufacturing flaws. These rejected barrels were deemed to be acceptable for the lower stress of firing slugs and less-lethal rounds, and thus were cut down in length for use as shotgun barrels. The KS-23 began to see use during the mid-1980s by several MVD forces. During the 1990s, research was made into improving the original design to make it usable in confined indoor areas. Two prototypes were proposed, the KS-23M and KS-23K, although only the M version saw use. Ammunition The KS-23 was created with the capability to fire several different types of ammunition, listed below: * \\"Shrapnel-10\\" (¬´–®—Ä–∞–ø–Ω–µ–ª—å-10¬ª): buckshot round with 10-meter effective range * \\"Shrapnel-25\\" (¬´–®—Ä–∞–ø–Ω–µ–ª—å-25¬ª): buckshot round with 25-meter effective range * \\"Barricade\\" (¬´–ë–∞—Ä—Ä–∏–∫–∞–¥–∞¬ª): cartridge with solid steel projectile able to destroy the engine block of a car at up to 100 meters * \\"Volna\\" (¬´–í–æ–ª–Ω–∞¬ª, \\"Wave\\"): inert version of cartridge used for education and practice during training * \\"Volna-R\\" (¬´–í–æ–ª–Ω–∞-–†¬ª, \\"Wave\\"): cartridge with less-lethal rubber bullet * \\"Strela-3\\" (¬´–°—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∞-3¬ª, \\"Arrow\\"): cartridge with less-lethal plastic bullet * \\"Cheremukha-7\\" (¬´–ß–µ—Ä—ë–º—É—Ö–∞-7¬ª, \\"Bird Cherry\\"-7): tear gas grenade with CN agent * \\"Siren'-7\\" (¬´–°–∏—Ä–µ–Ω—å-7¬ª, \\"Lilac\\"): tear gas grenade with CS agent * \\"Zvezda\\" (¬´–ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞¬ª, \\"Star\\"): flash-bang round * PV-23 (–ü–í-23): blank (grenade launching) cartridge Later, two add-on muzzle mortars were produced, the 36 mm Nasadka-6 and 82 mm Nasadka-12, bringing with them several new ammunition types: * Blank grenade launching cartridge to be used with muzzle mortars * 36 mm \\"Cheremukha-6\\" tear gas grenade * 82 mm \\"Cheremukha-12\\" \\"high-efficiency\\" tear gas grenade for use on open areas Variants =KS-23= The original KS-23 was developed jointly by NIISpetstekhniki (MVD) and TsNIITochmash in 1971, it was accepted for use by the Soviet police in 1985. The gun has a barrel length of 510 mm and an overall length of 1040 mm. The KS-23 has an underbarrel tubular magazine capable of holding three rounds, with one in the chamber giving the gun a maximum round capacity of four. The gun's effective range is 150 m. =KS-23M= The KS-23M ¬´–¥—Ä–æ–∑–¥¬ª (Carbine, Special, 23 mm, modernized - project: Drozd > \\"Thrush\\") was developed on the base of the KS-23. Development for it was started in October 1990. Twenty-five carbines were submitted for testing on December 10, 1991. After which the winner, then designated S-3, became the KS-23M \\"Thrush\\" and was accepted for use by the police and the Internal Troops of Russia. The KS-23M includes a detachable wire buttstock and shortened barrel, as opposed to the fixed wooden stock on standard KS-23s. The gun is still chambered in 23 mm. Its overall length with the buttstock is 875 mm, without, 650 mm, and the barrel is 410 mm long. The gun's effective range is 150 m. =KS-23K= The KS-23K is a redesigned KS-23 that features a bullpup layout. The KS-23K was accepted in 1998 for the use of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). Development and adoption of this carbine was motivated by the fact that in the earlier accepted configurations of the KS-23 and KS-23M a major noted deficiency was that the tubular magazine did not make it possible to rapidly reload or change the type of ammunition being used, because of this a major design change for the KS-23K is that it has an extended box magazine that holds seven shells instead of the three shells seen on the other models. The gun has a mechanical safety located on the left side, above the pistol handle and open non adjustable sights. The gun's effective range is 100 m. =TOZ-123= The civilian version of the KS-23 is the TO–ó-123 ¬´–°–µ–ª–µ–∑–µ–Ω—å-4¬ª (–¢–ûZ-123 \\"Drake-4\\").

With a population of 430 in 2011,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica it is the least populated of the Portuguese municipalities, and the only Portuguese municipality, by law, without a civil parish (freguesia, the smallest administrative unit in Portugal). Its area is .Eurostat Vila do Corvo, has at times been wrongly referred to as Vila Nova do Corvo. The village, the unique agglomeration on the island of Corvo, is constructed of small homes located along narrow roadways and alleys rising along the hills of the southern one- third of the island. The coastal area of the village is dominated by the Corvo Aerodrome and ports linking the community to the outside world. History The island of Corvo as seen through the mists across the channel on Flores One of the gentler slopes along the eastern coast of the island, around Cal√ßadas Old windmill dating back to the 19th Century Fabrica da Manteiga Cooperative Agr√≠cola Corvense, constructed in the early part of the 20th-Century The history of the Azores is linked to non-official exploration during the period of the late 13th century in maps, such as the Genoese Atlas Medici (1351). Although it did not specify an island of Corvo, the Medici Atlas did refer to an Insula Corvi Marini (Island of the Marine Crow), in a seven-island archipelago. A later Mapa Catal√£o (Catalan Map), from Spain, referred to two islands of Corvo and Flores in 1375. During Portuguese official history the Western Group was discovered during the navigator Diogo de Teive and his son's (Jo√£o de Teive) 1452 return from the Banks of Newfoundland, after his second voyage of exploration.Jos√© Saramango (2006) The Portuguese Court began to refer to the new Ilhas das Flores (Islands of Flowers), identifying Corvo as the Ilha de Santa Iria (Island of Saint Irene), but other nautical charts continued to refer to this island as the Ilh√©u das Flores (Islet or Island of Flowers), Ilha da Est√°tua (Island of the Statue), Ilha do Farol (Island of the Lighthouse) or Ilha de S√£o Tom√°s (Island of Saint Thomas).For a while it was also known as Ilha do Marco (Island of the Mark), which was attributed to its reference as a geographic marker for sailors, or likely, the location of a small promontory, where a marker was placed, that received the name Ponta do Marco. The island was placed under the control of Diogo Teive, who became the first Captain-Donat√°rio. Regardless, it was only in the following year that King Afonso V of Portugal \\"recognized\\" these new discoveries (January 20, 1453) and donated them to his uncle, Afonso, Duke of Braganza and Count of Barcelos. The first proprietor showed little interest in settlement, sending only the obligatory cattle to settle the island and establish his legitimate possession. Fern√£o Telles, the third Captain-Donat√°rio between 1475 and 1503, was the first to attempt to colonize Corvo (contracting the Flemish entrepreneur Willem van der Haegen), but abandoned his settlement after a couple of years. By 1507, both islands of Corvo and Flores were identified by Valentim Fernandes as unpopulated. Diogo das Chagas also referred to an initial settlement of 30 people, under contract of Terceirenses Ant√£o Vaz and Lopo Vaz de Azevedo (1508‚Äì1510), who had little success on Corvo; they eventually returned to Terceira in 1515, leaving Ant√≥nio Silveira de Machado in charge. But the settlement did not persist.A similar colony by three Barcelos family members failed following this attempt. Following these successive failed attempts to settle the land, Gon√ßalo de Sousa (second Captain-Donat√°rio of the islands of Corvo and Flores) was authorized to send slaves (likely from the island of Santo Ant√£o, in the Cape Verde archipelago) to Flores and Corvo as farmers and cattlemen (November 12, 1548). In 1570, the building that would later become the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres was constructed. Around 1580, colonists from Flores arrived on Corvo, and a small self-sufficient, isolated settlement was formed. These Corvinos survived a meagre existence, dedicating their venture to subsistence crops and grazing sheep and/or goats, along with fishing offshore. Commerce and trade primarily occurred across the channel, but atmospheric conditions restricted maritime connections to the rest of the islands between March and September. As Gaspar Frutuoso later indicated, by the end of the 16th century the population consisted of houses \\"...of 20 neighbours, renters and masters' blacks...certain slaves, and married mulattos with slaves...\\" Along with Flores, the island passed into the hands of Martinho de Mascarenhas in 1593. But the situation economically became aggravated and desperate: the annual payments to the seigneur increased; the local population increased; the connection with the outside world reluctantly forced a level of self- sufficiency; the impossibility of increasing the area under cultivation; and the frequent incursions by English privateers, that marked the conflict during the Iberian Union. Much like other Azorean communities in the late 16th century, piracy and privateering marked their local history, even as some locals collaborated with or befriended these raiders. In exchange for protection and payments, the islanders provided fresh water, provisions and men, as well as permitting the treatment of the sick and repairing vessels. But in 1587 Corvo was sacked by English privateers who had attacked Lajes das Flores. Then, in 1632, Barbary coast pirates (from the Ottoman Empire) twice attempted to disembark in Porto da Casa, which was only a small bay (and an area that was easily accessible to pirates). In one account, while the men were in the hills looking after their flocks and the women were in their homes, a large group of pirates arrived in the vicinity of the settlement. The pirates fired on the settlement, and were met by rocks thrown from the cliff- tops. During the battle, the local vicar carried his small image of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio (Our Lady of the Rosary) into the battle, and placed it along the Canada da Rocha. The statue had for many years been placed in the area of Porto da Casa, but had been moved to the altar of the small chapel on the cliff. The battle was arduous, but 200 Corvinos were able to defeat the pirates, capturing many weapons, with no loss of life and while capturing a Moor. It is said that the victory was credited to the statue, which was the patron saint of Corvo, and had mysteriously deflected many of the pirates' rounds. The pirates retreated and did not return to the small island. Thereafter the statue became known as the statue of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres (Our Lady of Miracles). It was the second parish priest, the Florentine In√°cio Coelho (brother of the Diogo das Chagas), who was able to convince Martinho de Mascarenhas (the second Captain-Donat√°rio) to assist the parish \\"in the name of the Virgin Mary\\". Today the statue is located in the parochial church. The parish of Corvo was created in 1674: its first pastor was the Faialense Bartolomeu Trist√£o. Until this time the colony was annually visited by a priest from Santa Cruz das Flores, sent by the Bishop of Angra to tend to the isolated community. In the 18th century, American whalers arrived in Flores to recruit crews and harpooners, and to re-provision their ships for their campaigns. Due to their experience, inhabitants from Corvo signed onto these crews, thus beginning a close relationship with the New England community of North America that would continue into the 20th Century (at times, this connection was more direct than its connection to Lisbon). Consequently, clandestine emigration was a constant of life, and a problem for the repressive Portuguese authorities, who were preoccupied with defections from obligatory military service and reductions in island tribute. The settlers on Corvo were obliged to pay a tithe to their Captains-Donat√°rio, and after 1759 (with the death of the 8th Duke of Aveiro and Count of Santa Cruz), to the Crown. During the Liberal Wars, a delegation from Corvo approached Regent Peter IV of Portugal to present the grave sentiments of the population and request that their payments be alleviated. Manuel Tom√°s de Avelar, chief of the Corvino delegation, traveled to Angra do Hero√≠smo to petition the liberal leadership of the Angra Regency. It was Mouzinho da Silveira who attempted to mitigate this servitude with a proposal to reduce the tithe payment (in wheat) and taxes, owing to the persistent poverty on the island. A decree was promulgated on May 14, 1832 by Peter IV and signed in Ponta Delgada, that reduced the tithe paid to the Crown's Donat√°rio (then Pedro Jos√© Caupers) in half (to 20 moios [] of wheat), as well as the elimination of the annual payment of 80,000 r√©is. The Crown would then assume the indemnity of the Donat√°rio. The tribute was completely abolished by 1835. On June 20, 1832, the Regent, Peter IV of Portugal, elevated the settlement of Corvo to the status of village and municipal seat. Until this time Corvo had been under the jurisdiction of Santa Cruz das Flores, as a civil parish of its neighbor across the channel. And after 1853, the foral (the town's royal charter) granted to the dual jurisdiction was extinguished, resulting in a liberal movement, where tenant farmers were able to raise their cattle and till their own lands, marking out a subsistence economy that supported porting ships. In 1886 the Civil Governor of the District of Horta, Manuel Francisco de Medeiros, asked the inhabitants what they wanted on visiting the community. He was surprised by the humble request of a Portuguese national flag for the island. It came into use when Albert of Monaco visited the island during his oceanographic and photographic expeditions. It was also visited in 1924 by the Portuguese writer Raul Brand√£o, who contributed to local myths and idyllic republican community with his work Ilhas Desconhecidas. From the beginning of the 19th and into the 20th century immigration continued unabated, except for a period between 1925 and 1955, as more Corvinos left the island in search of economic security‚Äî a process that continued well into the 1980s. By 1938, the island received its first permanent medical resident, Jo√£o Rodrigues Ferreira da Silva, who lived on the island until 1945, and for whom the only medical building was named. On April 10, 1997, the urban nucleus of the village of Corvo consisted primarily of the old one and two-storey house/barns that populated the centre of the municipality and were classified as an architectural group of public interest' () by the Regional Government of the Azores, supported by IGESPAR. Geography =Physical geography= =Climate= Vila do Corvo has a borderline Mediterranean (Csa) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with warm summers and mild winters. =Human geography= { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } The Vila do Corvo is implanted along the maritime coast of the island Corvo, and represents the only inhabited settlement on the island.; With a perimeter of , the settlement is dominated by the sheer cliffs of the extinct volcanic crater of the Caldeir√£o, which extend above sea level. The urban area covers an incredibly small by on an ancient debris field in the south, along the cove of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio. The landscape north of the settlement is characterized by agricultural fields and pastureland, divided by stone walls. In the last part of the 19th century, a 9% drop in the population marked a period of emigration to the United States, generally associated with most of the archipelago. Yet continued emigration between Corvo and New England would mark the demographic oscillation during the 20th century, as well. There were four identifiable periods: * the first period, until 1925, when the United States began restricting immigration and the local population diminished by 18% * the second period, until 1955, during a period of emigration to Latin America, (principally to Brazil) that was fairly insignificant, but resulted in a 10% increase in the population * a third period, which lasted until the beginning of the 1980s, coincident with a new wave of emigration, resulting in a 49% decrease in the local residents * finally, from the 1980s until the beginning of the 21st century, resulting from new restrictions on emigration, and local social and economic development, that resulted in little change In the last 14 years that population has seen a 12.5% increase, which is attributed to the following factors: * the return of √©migr√©s * the appearance of new employment opportunities, in addition to the creation of a basic education primary school, which helped to fix the young population Economy Generally, the inhabitants dedicate themselves to fishing, agriculture, or raising cattle. Most services on the island support these activities, as well as annual tourism. Although the island is small, the municipal government constructed a small campsite in the area of Praia da Areia, with washrooms, barbecues and picnic tables in order to support annual eco-friendly visitors to the island. Architecture The centre of Vila do Corvo, situated in the eastern part of the Rua da Matriz and characterized by a group of narrow roads, alleyways and a labyrinth of buildings, is the historic town. The buildings are generally two-storey constructions, oriented towards the south and roofed in tile. Some of these buildings continue to have spaces for pig-pens, corrals and annexes aligned to the alleyways. =Civic= * Correios, Tel√©grafos e Telefones (CTT) Building (), common on many of the islands of the Azores, the CTT building is a 20th-century construction located in the Largo do Ribeir√£o * Pit of Jun√ßa (), a subterranean silo in the form of an amphora, used to store cereals, constructed in the 18th century * Lighthouse of Ponta Negra (), located west of the small port of Boqueir√£o, alongside the windmills of Corvo, it was established in 1910 to secure the southern coast of the island * Public Office Building (), the building of the antique public finances for the island of Corvo, built during the 20th century * Residence of Mariana Lopes () * Threshing Circle (Avenida Nova) () * Windmills of Corvo () ‚Äì a group of three windmills located along the Caminhos dos Moinhos (Windmill Ways), constructed of volcanic rock in a conical form, with a wooden roof and octagonal sails, accessed by elevated doorways with volcanic lateral symmetrical steps =Religious= * Church of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres (), the 18th century Baroque-remodelled parochial church was constructed in 1570, to house the legendary image of Our Lady of the Miracles who \\"miraculously\\" saved the Corvinos from pirate attacks during the 16th century * Imp√©rio of the Divino Espirito Santo (), a simple rectangular building used for celebrations tied with the Cult of the Holy Spirit, constructed around 1871 Culture The island celebrates annual celebrations marking the feast day of their patron, Our Lady of Miracles (), on August 15.

In the regional elections of 2005 she was a candidate for Basque regional president or lehendakari, but lost out to the nationalist candidate Juan Jose Ibarretxe of the EAJ-PNV. On April 18, 2007 she announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had already been operated on once. On May 21, 2008 after a meeting with Mariano Rajoy she informed him of her intention to resign from the leadership position in the regional representation of the Partido Popular. San Gil is married and has two children.

Transcribing the works of Father [Gaspar Frutuoso], Francisco Gomes documented the arrival of the crew of the nau Nossa Senhor da Miseric√≥rida. He included Gaspar Frutuoso's 1589 reference, described the growing urban area of Santa Cruz as a \\"well divided and plane villa\\" covered in thatched roofs. Ponta Delgada, he continued, was a parish of 30 neighbours surrounding its small hermitage (dedicated to Santo Amaro, even as its ecclesiastical patron since the 16th century was the apostle Peter). In the beginning of the 17th-Century Diogo das Chagas, referred to the villa of Santa Cruz as the \\"head of the island\\" and the center of the administration, noting \\"[the village]...is very well located with the best port on the island...\\". He described his hometown as built on \\"firm foundations\\", delimited by its interlocking roads that began at the Santa Cruz sandbar and the other the port of Po√ßas, all in the direction of Monte Calv√°rio (today, Monte das Cruzes). He described \\"...the first road of the village and from the Porto das Po√ßas another road, which is the last in the village, and where the rest of the roads intersect...\\". This year marked the municipal administration of the northern half of the island; part of the administrative regalia, was the obligatory construction of a lighthouse. A primitive church, dating to the 16th century and constructed in 1627, by vicar In√°cio Coelho, who in 1641 also provided land for the founding of the Franciscan Convent of S√£o Boaventura, as well as the bread and wine for religious ceremonies. By the end of 1693, Friar Agostinho de Mont'Alverne, referred to 9000 inhabitants, living in 180 homes, primarily in the village of Santa Cruz. These original settlers were Portuguese, primarily from the area of the Alentejo and Minho. It was about this time that the third oldest of the parishes was created by the Diocese in Angra, on 9 July 1693: Nossa Senhora do Pilar, delimited by the ravines of Barrosas (in the north) and Alagoa (in the south). The two localities that formed the parish, Cedros and Ponta Ruiva, de-annexed from the parishes of S√£o Pedro de Ponta Delgada and the Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o, in Santa Cruz, included 50 homes and 176 people. With its presbytery and image of it patron saint provided by the Count of Santa Cruz, its primitive parochial church was later expanded in 1719 and reconstructed in 1822. By 1717, Father Ant√≥nio Corderio described a population of over 200 homes, on a plain surface, well constructed, with four roads that lead to the sea, cut by various lanes. Many of its roads were marked by iconic buildings, including the hermitage of St. Peter and main parochial church (which continued to be constructed and reconstructed into the 18th century), in addition to the hermitages of S√£o Sebasti√£o, Santa Catarina, and the Franciscan Convent of S√£o Boaventura (founded in 1641 by father In√°cio Coelho). The parochial church of Ponta Delgada resulted from the reconstruction of the old hermitage, around 1763, under the initiative of Father Francisco de Fraga e Almeida. Initially, the parish also included the areas of Ponta and Ponta Ruiva, but which were later deannexed to form the parishes of the Faj√£s (in 1676) and Nossa Senhora do Pilar (in 1693), respectively. About the same time, Jos√© Ant√≥nio de Sousa Bettencourt, a natural and property-owner from the island of Graciosa, began constructing a hermitage in the area of Caveira, that was consecrated on 22 December 1763, to the invocation of the Sainted Souls of the Flames of Purgatory (). At the time, the inhabitants (numbering about 100 in 32 homes) were subject to the \\"spiritual and corporal convenience\\" of the parish of S√£o Caetano in Lomba, since July 1757. Unfortunately, this parish operated in the neighbouring municipality of Lajes, and the parishioners were required to trek the distance for services between valleys. This continued until 1833 and 1834, when the little settlement of Caveira was transformed into a parish, thereby obtaining the patron of Benditas Almas (Blessed Souls), from 1954 on the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Livramento (Our Lady of Freedom)). Santa Cruz, around 1815, had already developed into a beautiful city, all but in name. But, as the old ecclesiastical ouvidor Jos√© Ant√≥nio Cam√µes observed, its principal roadways (Rua das Po√ßas, Rua do Rego, Rua de Santa Catarina, Rua do Porto, Rua Nova and Rua de S√£o Sebasti√£o do Moio) and various lanes were irregular, as too were its buildings. Of the 429 buildings registered by the local administration, only 113 were covered by standard shingles of the period. Of the 419 people that inhabited the areas of Ribeira dos Barqueiros, Vales, Pampilhal, Fazenda and Al√©m da Ribeira (there were no records for the centre of town), no one person used footwear. Poverty was a general condition, and the Donat√°rios of the island (first the Fonsecas, later the Counts of Santa Cruz and finally Pedro Jos√© Caupers) subjugated the populous as serfs. The Crown had bestowed the lands, politico-military institutions and clergy for the islanders, but neglected the socio-political institutions that relegated, as Father Cam√µes described: ...the inhabitants of the island of Flores [as the]...most poor and miserable of the universe (except for the Corvinos). The cornerstone of the parochial church of Caveira was placed on 13 June 1870, and its construction was completed on 11 September 1880, with the consecration of the altar. Since 7 January 1841, the villa of Santa Cruz, was the judicial center for the dual-administration of Flores and Corvo (the Western archipelago); the justice system was handled from Santa Cruz, although a magistrate came from off-island. Santa Cruz grew and quickly surpassed Lajes demographically and in its economic position, finally coopting the politics in the two islands in 1895. On the 18 November of that year, the municipality of Lajes was made redundant, and along with Corvo, it became an integrated municipality from 1895 to about 1898. In 1898, the counsel Jos√© Luciano de Castro undertook the restoration of the individual administrative divisions. Alleging problems with the firmness of its lateral walls, the parochial church of Cedros was demolished in September 1945, and a new temple constructed: it was consecrated on 18 June 1954. Geography The twin lakes of Lagoa Funda and Lagoa Rasa, located in the central part of the municipality, and part of the Caldeira Funda Natural Forest Reserve A view of Pico dos Sete P√©s, one of the peaks that mark the interior of Santa Cruz =Physical geography= As part of a volcanic island, the municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores offers several scenic vistas, with extinct volcanic cones and lakes in an area generally rugged. It is a natural garden, whose principal activities includes floral-culture and the ubiquitous Azorean dairy industries. The only significantly level ground is occupied by its primary center, Santa Cruz das Flores (parish), located on the eastern coast and near the municipal border with Lajes das Flores. Apart from a commercial center, it is the home of the island's only airport and secondary school. To the north, along the only roadway, is the hamlet of Fazenda de Santa Cruz, noted for its Forest Reserve (Reserva Florestal da Fazenda de Santa Cruz), artificial lake and the island's only electrical station (constructed in 1967). The park is home to a small spawning program for trout, provides sites for picnicking, location of deer pens and an abundance of endemic plant species. At the end of the Regional Road is the community of Ponta Delgada a coastal community with a line of sight to Corvo, as well as many sheltered coves and bays. The Gruta dos Enchar√©us (an enormous coastal grotto 50 meters long by 25 wide), the Gruta do Galo, the islets of Maria Vaz, Cart√°rio, Abr√µes, Muda, P√£o de A√ß√∫car and Furado, as well as the plains of Ponta Delgada, Moinho and Vermelha, among others, are natural symbols of the coast of this municipality. = Ecoregions/Protected areas = The western and interior parts of the municipality are largely vacant of inhabitants and unspoiled by development, partly responsible for the island's biodiversity being recognized by UNESCO (May 26, 2000). Many of the islands natural resources are located in this region, which includes Morro Alto (the highest point in the municipality and island at 915 meters) and the following natural sites of community interest: * Recreational Forest Reserve Lu√≠s Paulo Camacho )Reserva Florestal de Recreio Lu√≠s Paulo Camacho Pamphlet (Portuguese) for the Recreational Forest Reserve.In 2002, this name was adopted by the Regional Government, to replace the more ambiguous Fazenda de Santa Cruz Forest Reserve () in regional legislative decree 16/1989 (30 August). * Natural Forest Reserve of Caldeira Funda () * Natural Forest Reserve of Caldeira Rasa () * Natural Forest Reserve of Morro Alto e Pico da S√© () In addition to the Forest Reserves, the municipality is bisected by a series of pedestrian hiking trails, that skirt the coastal areas and the interior. These trails, at many levels of endurance, include trips that cover: Ponta Delgada, Cedros, Ponta Ruiva, the village of Santa Cruz, Fazenda, Monte, Vales, Ribeira dos Barqueiros and even the smaller parish of Caveira.Itiner√°rios Pedestres do Concelho Pamphlet (Portuguese) of the Hiking Trails. =Climate= Santiago des Flores has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) as the warmest month mean is just at 22.8 ¬∞C. It has the highest rainfall of all the Azores‚Äô islands and owing to the influence of the Gulf Stream the mildest winters of any place so far from the equator. However, the warm Gulf Stream waters mean rain falls on two-thirds of all days during the year and humidity averages around 80 percent. =Human geography= The northern centre of Ponta Delgada connecting Flores with Corvo { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } Situated on the maritime coast, the urbanized area is situated on plateau demarcated by a western cliff and the main airport, and surrounded on its western edge by agricultural fields. The municipality is administered by four civil parishes () that include: * Caveira - the smallest parish in size, bordering Lajes das Flores, with less than 100 inhabitants; * Cedros - the \\"middle\\" parish that straddles the river-valleys of Alagoa Bay and historical location of orchards owing to its micro-climate; * Ponta Delgada - third-largest community on the island, located along the northern coast; * Santa Cruz das Flores - municipal seat, location of the airport and largest population (less than 2000 inhabitants. Although the population of the municipality has remained relatively stable, it has seen a slow decrease over the years. Since 2006, the local municipal government has developed many infrastructures, re-qualified many existing buildings, roads and improved the accessibility of existing localities. This included many improvements and expansion of roadways, provision of electrical, water and sanitary services, as well as the construction of new subdivisions (such as the Loteamento da Ter√ßa) and beautification programs.C√¢mara Municipal de Santa Cruz das Flores (January 2007), p.2-11 Architecture =Civic= * Lighthouse of Ponta do Albernaz (), inaugurated on 28 January 1925 as part of the Plano Geral de Alumiamento e Balizagem (General Illumination and Nautical Signalling Plan) for the northern coast of Flores, with the intent of providing a beacon for shipping passing through the Flores-Corvo; * Municipal Library of Santa Cruz das Flores () * Museum Pimental de Mesquita () * Whaling Factory of Boqueiro () =Religious= * Church of Benditas Almas (), around 1767 the first small church, was constructed under the initiative of Jos√© Ant√≥nio de Sousa Bettencourt (dedicated to the Blessed Souls) on the site of today's cemetery, but the current church (of the same invocation) was only founded in 1867; * Church of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o (), the monolithic/bulky church of the Conception, sited on the primitive location of village temple, was initiated in 1781, but only completed a century later; for grande facade and ornate interior, the Regional Government classified this unique structure in the western group of islands as a Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico; * Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar (), owing to its distance from Santa Cruz, the residents of Cedros solicited the Bishop of Angra, to Cedros de-annexed and its own curia installed. In order to justify this request the residents contributed, with their own funds to construct a church, supported by then-Captain-Donatary, D. Martinho Mascarenhas (6th Count of Santa Cruz), who contributed a retable and donated an image of Senhora do Pilar. * Church of S√£o Pedro (), parochial church dedicated to St. Peter, constructed in 1763, promoted by Father Francisco de Fraga e Almeida, a man of great fortune, old vicar and Ouvidor for the islands of Flores and Corvo. The church was remodeled during the latter part of the 20th century; * Convent of S√£o Boaventura (), today home to the Museum of Flores, the Franciscan convent was built under the initiative of In√°cio Coelho, then vicar of Santa Cruz. It is suggested that this church was originally conceived in fulfillment of a vow following the triumph of Portuguese forces over Spain during the Restoration War.

Early years Born into wealth in Cottingley, Yorkshire, England, he was the eldest son of Henry Wickham, Esq., of Cottingley, Lieutenant-Colonel in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, and a justice of the peace for the West Riding. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of William Lamplugh, vicar of Cottingley. Wickham attended Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a proteg√© of Cyril Jackson.Durey (2006), 719‚Äì720. He took a law degree in Geneva, Switzerland in 1786. He was also called to the bar in England, at Lincoln's Inn. In 1788 he married Eleonora Madeleine Bertrand (d. 1836), whose father was professor of mathematics in the University of Geneva. They had one son, Henry Lewis Wickham (b. 1789); Henry's son, William, was a member of parliament for Petersfield. Magistrate From 1790 to 1794, Wickham was a commissioner of bankrupts.Sparrow (n.d.) Following the passing of the Middlesex Justices Act of 1792, Wickham was appointed in 1793 as one of the new stipendiary magistrates. In this position he began to undertake secret work for the Government, at the behest of Lord Grenville, the then Foreign Secretary. This was at a time when the French Revolution was causing great concern to the British political establishment, and powers were given to magistrates under the 1793 Aliens Act. An early action of Wickham's in his new post was the infiltration of the radical London Corresponding Society, leading to the arrest and trial for treason of its leaders. Despite the apparent failure of his spies to uncover anything incriminating amidst the society's meetings and papers or to entrap the members in sedition, treason, or other crimes, Wickham was made 'superintendent of aliens' in 1794 by the then Home Secretary, the Duke of Portland.Sparrow (1990), 363‚Äì365. Intelligence activities Because of his knowledge of Switzerland, Grenville sent Wickham to that country in 1794 as assistant to the British ambassador. A year later he was named charg√© d'affaires when the ambassador took extended leave, and then appointed ambassador in his own right. His unofficial duties were to liaise with French opponents of the Revolution. By 1795, England was openly combating the French revolutionaries who had usurped and beheaded King Louis XVI and his Queen, Marie Antoinette. Wickham established a spy network in Switzerland, southern Germany and in France and negotiated with French Royalists and others, supporting amongst other initiatives the disastrous rising in la Vend√©e.Sparrow (1990), 368‚Äì369. Wickham strengthened the British intelligence system by emphasising the centrality of the intelligence cycle - query, collection, collation, analysis and dissemination - and the need for an all-source centre of intelligence.Michael Durey, \\"William Wickham, the Christ Church Connection and the Rise and Fall of the Security Service in Britain, 1793‚Äì1801.\\" English Historical Review 121.492 (2006): 714-745.Roger Knight, Britain Against Napoleon: The Organization of Victory, 1793-1815 (2013) pp 125-42. The government secretly funded Wickham with a substantial budget for his objects. A good deal of this was spent in a complex plot to bring French revolutionary general Charles Pichegru, over to the ranks of Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√© who maintained an army on the Rhine. Wickham advanced ¬£8,000 to feed and supply Pichegru's troops; however, Pichegru vacillated and the initiative failed. Wickham also reported on French troop positions, armaments and operations. French spies, however, learned of his network, and France pressured Swiss authorities to expel him. Wickham resigned, returning to England in 1798, where he resumed, after some internal wrangling, his position as Superintendent of Aliens, and was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. For a year and a half he was \\" the effective head of the secret service\\".Durey (2006), 736. He returned to Europe to Swabia, close to the Swiss border, in 1799 where his averred role was to liaise with the armies of Austria and Russia in Europe, which were supported by Britain against Napoleon. Again he negotiated inconclusively with Pichegru, but his expensive intrigues were rendered useless by Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Marengo (June 1800); moreover he was accused in London of misuse of public funds, which brought him close to a nervous breakdown. He returned to London in 1801. Ireland In 1802 Wickham was appointed to the Privy Council and named Chief Secretary for Ireland, a post he held until 1804, when he resigned following the execution of Robert Emmet, as he felt the laws governing Ireland to be \\"unjust, oppressive and unchristian\\".\\"Robert Emmet between history and memory\\", History Ireland website, accessed 22 March 2014. He also entered Parliament as MP for the Irish borough constituency of Cashel: he sat for Cashel from 1802 to 1806, and for Callington in Cornwall from 1806 to 1807. Family papers The Hampshire Record Office holds a number of Wickham's papers. The archive relates also to his grandson William Wickham, who was vice-chairman on the first County Council. The archive includes grants of full powers to Wickham in 1799 and 1801; also poll books for the election of members of parliament representing Oxford University in 1801 and 1809, a plan showing the arrangement of wine in the cellars, and papers about Wickham's success in growing fig trees, which continue to flourish at his home in Binsted. His other property was Lullebrook Manor at Cookham in Berkshire.

He developed Bradshaw's Guide, a widely sold series of combined railway guides and timetables. Biography Bradshaw was born at Windsor Bridge, Pendleton, in Salford, Lancashire. On leaving school he was apprenticed to an engraver named Beale in Manchester, and in 1820 he set up his own engraving business in Belfast, returning to Manchester in 1822 to set up as an engraver and printer, principally of maps. He was a religious man. Although his parents were not exceptionally wealthy, when he was young they enabled him to take lessons from a minister devoted to the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. He joined the Society of Friends (the Quakers) and gave a considerable part of his time to philanthropic work. He worked a great deal with radical reformers such as Richard Cobden in organising peace conferences and in setting up schools and soup kitchens for the poor of Manchester. It is his belief as a Quaker that is quoted as causing the early editions of Bradshaw's guides to have avoided using the names of months based upon Roman deities which was seen as \\"pagan\\" usage. Quaker usage was, and sometimes still is, \\"First month\\" for January, \\"Second month\\" for February and so on. Days of the week were \\"First day\\" for Sunday and so on. In 1841, he founded a high- quality weekly magazine, edited by George Falkner, called Bradshaw's Manchester Journal, described as \\"a 16-page miscellany of art, science and literature, to sell at the cheap price of a penny-halfpenny a week. ...

He is interred in the Gamlebyen cemetery about a mile from the cathedral in Oslo. His gravestone is on the left by the gate near Oslo hospital.The Railway Magazine, January 1950 Bradshaw's railway guides Bradshaw's was a series of railway timetables and travel guide books published by W.J. Adams of London. George Bradshaw initiated the series in 1839. The Bradshaw's range of titles continued after his death in 1853 until 1961. Great British Railway Journeys/Great Continental Railway Journeys Former British politician Michael Portillo used a copy of what was described as a Bradshaw's guide (the 1863 edition of Bradshaw's Descriptive Railway Hand-Book of Great Britain and Ireland) for Great British Railway Journeys, a BBC Two television series in which he travelled across Britain, visiting recommended points of interest noted in Bradshaw's guide book, and where possible staying in recommended hotels. The first series was broadcast in early 2010, a second in early 2011, a third in early 2012, and a fourth in early 2013; series 5 was broadcast in January and February 2014. The success of the series sparked a new interest in the guides and facsimile copies of the 1863 edition became an unexpected best seller in the UK in 2011. In the 14th episode of the series, \\"Batley to Sheffield\\", Portillo met a great-great- granddaughter of George Bradshaw, who showed him part of the family archive. At the end of 2012, a new series, Great Continental Railway Journeys, was broadcast with Portillo using the 1913 edition of Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide to make journeys through various European countries and territories, prompting two publishers to produce facsimiles of the handbook.

Proposed parents Several different sets of parents have been proposed for Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit (as well as Meritaten Tasherit). =Ankhesenpaaten and Akhenaten= She is most commonly held to have been the daughter of Ankhesenpaaten (a daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten) and Akhenaten himself.Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt, Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback), p 234 The title of the princess is thought to have been \\"Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit, born of Ankhesenpaaten, born of the King's Great Wife Nefertiti\\". If we assume that Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit was the daughter of Ankhesenpaaten and Akhenaten, she must have been born towards the very end of Akhenaten's reign. Since Ankhesenpaaten was born around the 5th year of her father's reign, the earliest year she could have had a child was around Year 16 of his reign. =Kiya and Akhenaten= Since both Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child., p.148Dr. Marc Gabolde: The End of the Amarna PeriodKramer, \\"Enigmatic Kiya\\" in A. K. Eyma ed., A Delta-man in Yebu, uPublish.com 2003, , p.54 =Meritaten and Smenkhare= Dodson proposed Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit was a daughter of the young royal couple Meritaten and Smenkhare. The young princess would have been named after Meritaten's sister.

To find common ground between parties, participants must search for signals of recognition, which are often subtle and prone to misunderstanding. Generally, smiles, bland faces, or frowns can be the positive, neutral, or negative signals. When verbal communication is possible, the participants can speak and then listen. Another aspect to establishing common ground is the use of visual cues. According to Gergle et al (2013), visual cues also help establish common ground in that it gives a reference to the speaker as to how much is understood. Overview In academia, grounding criterion is the standard that communicators must meet for a communication to succeed. Effective communication can be further thought of as having two distinct parts‚Äîthe presentation phase, in which the information is relayed, and the acceptance phase, in which the receiver acknowledges comprehension of the information. Historically, the commons in many communities were places available to everyone, such as the village pump, or the sidewalk of a road. Thus, even for those far from home, the sight of someone familiar only from the commons might be comforting to a homesick or lonely traveller. This effect can be seen in many kinship groups. One measure for interpersonal relationships is warmth. Thus discovery of common ground is commonly cause for comfort and additional happiness among the participants, and is one step on the way to respect or perhaps friendship. However, to some people in small-enough communities, conflict may have occurred between them too often to find common ground, and isolation from each other is the only path toward healing and a healthy relationship. For such people, shunning of the commons is necessary. But if one is forced onto the commons, then a minimal acceptable behavior toward others is necessary when on common ground, as in a truce. As an example, one technique for anonymous trade between mutually suspicious parties was for the offerers to lay the goods (such as gold) in a clearing (the potential common ground), and then to hide in the forest with the gold in their plain sight, while armed with weapons, in the event of treachery. Thus, offers could be made to traders. The traders, who bore goods (and who were also armed with weapons), would lay the trade goods in the clearing, and take the gold back with them. This was a mechanism for trading between the Moors and the gold miners of Africa over a millennium ago, and also for trade with Sumatra (the isle of gold) and other islands of Southeast Asia. This has some structural similarity to the policy of mutually assured destruction during the Cold War era. Today, we have the advantage of more highly developed communications techniques, but the basic need for minimizing suspicion and maximizing trust remains with us, worldwide, at a time when polarization is increasing.

She is a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the riding of Haliburton‚ÄîKawartha Lakes‚ÄîBrock, and serves as Minister of Infrastructure in the cabinet of Premier Doug Ford. Background Scott was born and raised in the village of Kinmount, Ontario, now part of the city of Kawartha Lakes. Her father, the late Bill Scott, was a federal Progressive Conservative MP from 1965 to 1993. She attended Loyalist College in Belleville where she obtained a degree in nursing. She worked as a Registered Nurse at the Ross Memorial Hospital and the Toronto General Hospital. Politics In the Canadian general election of 2000, she ran in Haliburton‚ÄîVictoria‚ÄîBrock for the federal Progressive Conservative party, but finished behind Liberal John O'Reilly and Canadian Alliance candidate Pat Dunn in a close, three-way race. From 2000 to 2003, she worked as an assistant to Progressive Conservative Senator Consiglio Di Nino. Scott was elected to the Ontario Legislature in the 2003 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Jason Ward in the riding of Haliburton‚ÄîKawartha Lakes‚ÄîBrock by over 7,000 votes. Scott was appointed opposition critic for training, colleges and universities. In the 2007 provincial election, Scott ran against Rick Johnson of the Ontario Liberal Party, and Joan Corrigan of the Ontario NDP. She defeated the Liberal candidate by almost 10,000 votes with 49.9% of the total vote. She then served as the official opposition critic for research and innovation and health promotion. On January 8, 2009, it was announced that Scott would resign as MPP to allow PC leader John Tory to seek a seat in the legislature. However, Tory was defeated by Johnson in the by-election that followed. Scott subsequently served as chair of the Ontario PC party's election preparedness committee until the 2011 election. In the 2011 election, in a rematch with Johnson, Scott regained her seat defeating Johnson by about 6,000 votes. She was re-elected in the 2014 election defeating Johnson again by about 3,000 votes. She then served as the Official Opposition Critic for Community Safety and Women's Issues until 2018. In the 2018 Ontario provincial election, Laurie Scott was re-elected for a fifth-term as the MPP for Haliburton-Kawartha Lakes-Brock.

A launch escape system (LES) or launch abort system (LAS) is a crew safety system connected to a space capsule, used to quickly separate the capsule from its launch vehicle rocket in case of a launch abort emergency, such as an impending explosion. The LES is typically controlled by a combination of automatic rocket failure detection, and a manual activation for the crew commander's use. The LES may be used while the launch vehicle is still on the launch pad, or during its ascent. Such systems are usually of two types: *A solid-fueled rocket, mounted above the capsule on a tower, which delivers a relatively large thrust for a brief period of time to send the capsule a safe distance away from the launch vehicle, at which point the capsule's parachute recovery system can be used for a safe landing on ground or water. The tower and rocket are jettisoned from the space vehicle in a normal flight at the point where it is either no longer needed, or cannot be effectively used to abort the flight. These have been used on the Mercury, Apollo, Soyuz, and Shenzhou capsules. *The crew are seated in ejection seats as used in military aircraft; each crew member returns to Earth with an individual parachute. Such systems are effective only in a limited range of altitudes and speeds. These have been used on the Vostok and Gemini capsules. History The escape system unintentionally blasted off from the Mercury spacecraft on the failed Mercury-Redstone 1 mission The idea of using a rocket to remove the capsule from a space vehicle was developed by Maxime Faget in 1958. The system, using the tower on the top of the space capsule to house rockets, was first used on a test of the Project Mercury capsule in March 1959. Historically, LES were used on American Mercury and Apollo spacecraft. Both designs used a solid-fuel rocket motor. The Mercury LES was built by the Grand Central Rocket Company in Redlands, California (which later became the Lockheed Propulsion Company). Apollo used a design that had many similarities to the Mercury system. LES continue to be used on the Russian Soyuz and Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. The SpaceX designed Dragon 2 uses a hypergolic liquid-fueled launch abort system integrated to the capsule to minimize spacecraft costs.  Related systems  The Soviet Vostok and American Gemini spacecraft both made use of ejection seats. The European Space Agency's Hermes and the Soviet Buran-class spaceplanes would also have made use of them if they had ever flown with crews. As shown by Soyuz T-10a, an LES must be able to carry a crew compartment from the launch pad to a height sufficient for its parachutes to open. Consequently, they must make use of large, powerful (and heavy) solid rockets. The Soyuz launch escape system is called CAC or SAS, from the Russian/transliterated Russian –°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ –ê–≤–∞—Ä–∏–π–Ω–æ–≥–æ –°–ø–∞—Å–µ–Ω–∏—è or Sistema Avariynogo Spaseniya, meaning emergency rescue system. The Soviet Proton launcher has flown dozens of times with an escape tower, under the Zond program and the TKS program. All of its flights were unmanned. The Space Shuttle was fitted with ejection seats for the two pilots in the initial \\"shakedown\\" flights, but these were removed once the vehicle was deemed operational and carried additional crew members, which could not be provided with escape hatches. Following the 1986 Challenger disaster, all surviving orbiters were fitted to allow for crew evacuation through the main ingress/egress hatch, although only when the Shuttle was in a controlled glide, as the crew would have had to reach the exit from their seats and jump out. A Dragon 2 undergoing a Pad Abort test on May 6, 2015, demonstrating a \\"pusher\\" LAS. The Orion spacecraft which was developed to follow the Space Shuttle program uses a Mercury and Apollo-style escape rocket system, while an alternative system, called the Max Launch Abort System (MLAS),NASA Spaceflight: Orion MLAS was investigated and would existing solid-rocket motors integrated into the bullet-shaped protective launch shroud. Under NASA's Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program Blue Origin was awarded $3.7 million for development of an innovative 'pusher' LAS, it is used on the New Shepard Crew Capsule. Also under NASA's CCDev program, SpaceX was awarded $75 million for the development of their own version of a \\"pusher\\" LAS. Their Dragon 2 spacecraft will use its SuperDraco engines during a launch abort scenario. Although often referred to as a \\"pusher\\" arrangement since it lacks a tower, the Dragon 2 LAS removes both the capsule and its trunk together from the launch vehicle. The system is designed to abort with the Super Draco engines at the top of the abort stack as occurs with a more traditional tractor LAS. The concept was first tested in a Pad Abort test conducted at SLC-40, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, on May 6, 2015. SpaceX tested the system on January 19, 2020 during ascent of the Falcon 9 rocket in Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 from where it plans to launch crews to the International Space Station. The second crewed spacecraft selected by NASA for its CCDEV program was Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, which like SpaceX's Dragon 2 spacecraft, will use a \\"pusher\\" launch escape system, consisting of four launch abort engines mounted on the service module that can propel the spacecraft away from its Atlas 5 launch vehicle in the event of an emergency on the pad or during ascent.https://spacenews.com/boeings-starliner-launch- abort-engine-suffers-problem-during-testing/ The engines, which use hypergolic propellants and generate 40,000 pounds-force of thrust each, are provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne.https://spacenews.com/boeings-starliner-launch-abort- engine-suffers-problem-during-testing/ The abort system was tested successfully during Starliner's pad abort test on November 4, 2019 at White Sands Missile Range. Orbital Sciences Corporation intends to sell the LAS it was building for the Orion spacecraft to future commercial crew vehicle providers in the wake of cancelation of the Constellation project.  Usage  ISRO Gaganyaan boilerplate during its launch escape system pad abort test, 5 July 2018. The first fully operational test flight of an LES was Apollo mission A-004 on January 20, 1966. The mission used a Little Joe II booster, carrying an early version of the Apollo command module. An accidental pad firing of a launch escape system occurred during the attempted launch of the unmanned Soyuz 7K-OK No.1 spacecraft on December 14, 1966. The vehicle's strap-on boosters did not ignite, preventing the rocket from leaving the pad. About 30 minutes later, while the vehicle was being secured, the LES engine fired. Separation charges started a fire in the rocket's third stage, leading to an explosion that killed a pad worker. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. Originally it was thought that the LES firing was triggered by a gantry arm that tilted the rocket past 7 degrees, meeting one of the defined in-flight abort conditions. Soyuz T-10 capsule aborts from the launch pad. The first usage with a manned mission occurred during the attempt to launch Soyuz T-10-1 on September 26, 1983. The rocket caught fire, just before launch, and the LES carried the crew capsule clear, seconds before the rocket exploded. The crew were subjected to an acceleration of 14 to 17 g (140 to 170 m/s2) for five seconds and were badly bruised. Reportedly, the capsule reached an altitude of and landed from the launch pad. In 2018 the crew of Soyuz MS-10 separated from their launch vehicle after a booster rocket separation failure occurred at an altitude of 50 km during the ascent. However, at this point in the mission the LES had already been ejected and was not used to separate the crew capsule from the rest of the launch vehicle. Backup motors were utilized to separate the crew capsule resulting in the crew landing safely and uninjured approximately 19 minutes after launch.

Albrecht's character \\"Todd\\" was a member of a small group of soldiers from the elven army, which was led by Zelda's brother Tyrelda. In the series, Zelda is, much to Link/Neil's surprise, black skinned, rather than white. Her brother Tyrelda and the rest of the elf troops are black as well and make constant reference to Alex Albrecht's character being the token white guy. A number of stereotypes associated with African-Americans in the real world are reverse-applied to Todd and the white elf race in the land of Highrule. By the end of the episode, Todd appears to have died along with Tyrelda and the rest of the gang, making for a short-lived but noteworthy contribution made by Alex to the series.The Legend of Neil - Season 3, Episode 4. Retrieved 2010-10-31. In May 2012, a new show was released on the Nerdist YouTube Channel called 4 Points with Alex Albrecht. The show features 4 people discussing 4 different topics. Albrecht and co-host Alison Haislip are the only permanent members of the panel, with the other spots filled by a personality from some other Nerdist show and a celebrity, usually from TV or movies. In April 2015, Alex and Alison Haislip started a new podcast called the Half Hour Happy Hour. He left the show in December 2018 and was replaced by Maude Garrett. He resides in Brentwood, a suburb of Los Angeles, California.

His murder by Jereboam O. Beauchamp in 1825 is referred to as the Beauchamp‚ÄìSharp Tragedy or \\"The Kentucky Tragedy.\\" Sharp began his political career representing Warren County, in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He briefly served in the War of 1812, then returned to Kentucky and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1813. He was re-elected to a second term, though his support of a controversial bill regarding legislator salaries cost him his seat in 1816. Allied with Kentucky's Debt Relief Party, he returned to the Kentucky House in 1817; in 1821, he accepted Governor John Adair's appointment to the post of Attorney General of Kentucky. Adair's successor, Joseph Desha, re-appointed him to this position. In 1825, Sharp resigned as attorney general to return to the Kentucky House. In 1820, rumors surfaced that Sharp had fathered a stillborn illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When the charges were repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation that the child was a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).Whited, pp. 404‚Äì405 Personal life Solomon Sharp was born on August 22, 1787, at Abingdon, Washington County, Virginia.Cooke, Part I, p. 27 He was the fifth child and third son of Captain Thomas and Jean (Maxwell) Sharp, a Scottish woman.Schoenbachler, p. 14 Through the male line he was a great-great-grandson of John Sharp, Archbishop of York. His father Thomas Sharp was a veteran of the Revolutionary War, participating in the Battle of King's Mountain.Levin, p. 109 The family briefly moved to the area near Nashville, Tennessee, and to North Carolina,Cooke, Part I, pp. 26-27 before settling permanently about 1795 at Russellville, Logan County, where they lived in a log cabin near the Muddy River.Allen, p. 256Mathias, 814Bruce, p. 9Schoenbachler, p. 15 Sharp \\"[intermittently attended] one of Logan County's academies\\" during his childhood years; the schools of Logan County were primitive then.Schoenbachler, p. 22 He read the law and was admitted to the bar in 1806.Schoenbachler 24 He opened a practice in Russellville, but soon relocated to the busier Warren County seat of Bowling Green, which had 154 residents in 1810.Cooke, Part I, pp. 27, 29 He engaged in land speculation, sometimes in partnership with his brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, and by 1824, had acquired 11,000 acres, mostly north of the Barren River in Warren County. Marriage and family After getting established, on December 17, 1818, Sharp at the age of 31 married Eliza T. Scott, the daughter of a physician who had served as an officer in the War of 1812. She was from Frankfort and above him in social standing. They had three children together. He moved the family to the state capital of Frankfort in 1820 for his political career.Bruce 11Schoenbachler 67 Political career In 1809, Sharp was elected to represent Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his tenure, he supported the legislature's election of Henry Clay to the U.S. Senate, the creation of a state lottery, and the creation of an academy in Barren County.Cooke, Part I, p. 30 He served on a number of committees, and for a time, served as interim speaker of the house during the General Assembly's second session. He was re-elected in 1810 and 1811. By 1810, the county had nearly 12,000 residents. During the 1811 session, Sharp worked with Ben Hardin to secure passage of a bill to ensure that state officers and attorneys at law would not be involved in dueling.Schoenbachler, p. 27 He also opposed a measure allowing harsher treatment of slaves. Sharp's political service was interrupted by the War of 1812. On September 18, 1812, he enlisted as a private in the Kentucky militia, serving under Lieutenant Colonel Young Ewing. Twelve days later, in a rapid rise even for the militia, he was promoted to major and made a part of Ewing's staff. Ewing's unit was put under the command of general Samuel Hopkins during his ineffective expedition against the Shawnee. In total, the expedition lasted forty-two days and never engaged the enemy. Sharp recognized the value of a record of military service in Kentucky politics, however; he was eventually was promoted to the rank of colonel.Cooke, Part I, p. 31Congressional Bio =U.S. Representative= In 1812,Schoenbachler 29 Sharp was elected to the Thirteenth Congress as a member of the United States House of Representatives and took his seat at the age of 25, the minimum for election. Aligning with the War Hawks, he defended President James Madison's decision to lead the country into the war, and supported a proposal to offer of land to any British deserters.Cooke, Part I, pp. 32‚Äì33 Sharp also \\"[passionately denounced] Federalist obstruction of the war effort\\".Schoenbachler, p. 30-31 In a speech on April 8, 1813, he opposed indemnity for those defrauded in the Yazoo land scandal in Mississippi.Cooke, Part I, p. 33 He allied with South Carolina's John C. Calhoun in supporting(Schoenbachler, p. 34) the Second Bank of the United States. Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, during which he served as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson.Cooke, Part I, p. 34 The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election. In 1817, Sharp was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his term, he supported measures for internal improvements, but opposed the creation of a state health board and a proposal to open the state's vacant lands to the widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the War of 1812. Most notably, he supported the creation of 46Schoenbachler, p. 40 new banks in the state, and proposed a tax on the branches of the Bank of the United States in Lexington and Louisville. =Accusations of illegitimate child= Etching of Anna Cooke In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an unmarried planter's daughter in her early 30s, claimed that Sharp was the father of her illegitimate child;Cooke, \\"Portrait of a Murderess\\", pp. 209-210Bruce 10 Sharp denied her claim.Cooke, Part I, p. 38 The stillborn child was rumored to have dark skin, and some speculated that it was a mulatto, with a black father. After her father's death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met Sharp. In addition to losing the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821. The scandal soon abated for Sharp, as Anna had a reputation as \\"a freethinker, reader of romantic fiction, and a libertine\\". Although Sharp's political opponents would continue to call attention to his putative child in future campaigns, his reputation remained largely untarnished.Cooke, Part I, p. 39 =Attorney general of Kentucky= In 1821, Sharp began a campaign for a seat in the Kentucky Senate. His opponent, attorney John U. Waring, was a notably violent and contentious man, frequently in court because of altercations. (In 1835, he shot and killed the attorney Samuel Q. Richardson).L. Johnson, pp. 58-59 Waring sent two threatening letters to Sharp, and on June 18, 1821, published a handbill attacking Sharp's character. Five days later, Sharp ceased campaigning for the senatorial seat. He accepted an appointment by Governor John Adair to the position of attorney general of Kentucky. Sharp's nomination was unanimously confirmed by the legislature on October 30, 1821.Cooke, Part I, pp. 39‚Äì40 Sharp took office at a critical time Kentucky's history. Still reeling from the financial Panic of 1819, state politicians had split into two camps: those who supported legislation favorable to debtors (the Debt Relief Party) and those who favored the protection of creditors (typically called Anti-Reliefers.) Sharp had identified with the Relief Party, as had Governor Adair.Cooke, Part II, pp. 121‚Äì125 In the 1824 presidential election, Sharp alienated some of his constituency by supporting his former House colleague John C. Calhoun instead of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. When it was clear that Calhoun's bid would fail, Sharp threw his support behind Andrew Jackson. He served as secretary of a meeting of Jackson supporters in Frankfort on October 2, 1824.Cooke, Part II, p. 126 After Governor Adair's term expired in 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha. Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed Sharp as attorney general. The Relief faction in the legislature passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period was referred to as the Old Court-New Court controversy.Cooke, Part II, pp. 126‚Äì130 Sharp's role in the Relief Party's plan to abolish the old court and replace it with a new, more favorable court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.Cooke, Part II, pp. 130‚Äì131 On May 11, 1825, Sharp was chosen to represent the Desha administration in welcoming the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution, to Kentucky. At a banquet in Lafayette's honor three days later, Sharp toasted the guest of honor: \\"The People: Liberty will always be safe in their holy keeping.\\" Shortly following this event, Sharp resigned as attorney general, likely because Relief Party advocates thought he would be more useful as a member of the General Assembly.Cooke, Part II, p. 134 The Anti-Relief partisans nominated former Senator John J. Crittenden for one of the two seats apportioned to Franklin County in the state House.Kirwan, p. 58 The Relief Party countered with Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent area lawyer. During the sharply contested campaign, both John U. Waring and Patrick Henry Darby, a land speculator, said that Sharp's life was at risk if he won. Opponents revived the charges of Sharp's illegitimate child.Cooke, Part II, p. 135 It was also alleged that Sharp had claimed that the child was mulatto and said he had a certificate from Cooke's midwife to that effect; whether Sharp made this claim may never be known for certain. Despite the controversy, Sharp netted the most votes in the election, winning by 69 out of a total of 1600 votes cast in the county. Murder and aftermath Jereboam O. Beauchamp was convicted of Sharp's murder. Jereboam O. Beauchamp stabs Sharp; illustration from The United States Criminal Calendar (1835) \\"It was a land of the fiddle and whisky, sweat and prayer, pride and depravity. - Robert Penn Warren, World Enough and Time: A Romantic Novel (1950) In the early hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp answered the door, the visitor grabbed him with his left hand and used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.Cooke, Part II, pp. 137‚Äì140 Because of the bitterness of the campaign and the timing of the murder, speculation mounted that Sharp had been killed by an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp's political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin.Kirwan, p. 60 The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private sources.L. Johnson, p. 48Cooke, Part II, p. 140 In the 1825 session of the General Assembly, a measure to form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session. In the investigation that followed, the evidence quickly pointed to Jereboam O. Beauchamp, 23, who had married the much older Anna Cooke in 1824. (She was a contemporary of Sharp). On November 11, 1825, a four-man posse arrested Beauchamp at his home in Franklin. He was tried and convicted of Sharp's murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence ‚Äì execution by hanging ‚Äì was to be carried out on June 16, 1826.L. Johnson, p. 49 Beauchamp requested a stay of execution so that he could write a justification of his actions; he continued to assert his avenging his wife's honor. The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp. After two suicide attempts with his wife, who died as a result of the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7, 1826.Cooke, Part II, pp. 143‚Äì146 Beauchamp's Confession was published in 1826.Whited, p. 404 Some editions included The Letters of Ann Cook as an appendix. Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author. The following year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote Vindication of the Character of the Late Col. Solomon P. Sharp to defend him from the charges contained in Beauchamp's confession. In Vindication, Dr. Sharp portrayed the killing as a political assassination: he named Patrick Darby, a partisan of the Anti-Relief faction, as co-conspirator with Beauchamp, an Anti-Relief stalwart.Johnson, \\"New Light of Beauchamp's Confession\\" Darby threatened to sue Sharp if he published his Vindication; and Waring threatened to kill him. Heeding these threats, Sharp did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.

Early life Goss was born in Los Angeles to a Korean father and a German mother, who worked as a jazz singer. Shortly after, she went with her mother to live in Japan, before coming back to the United States and settling down in Chicago, where Goss was raised for most of her childhood. Career Goss started her career in music early, debuting as a singer for the underground band Avernus at the age of fifteen. She went on to write and publish her own underground extreme metal fanzine at the age of sixteen, interviewing widely recognized bands such as Emperor, Darkthrone, Mayhem and Bathory, to name a few. At seventeen, she moved to Norway in order to pursue an offer she received to play keyboards for Norwegian black metal band Ancient. After recording one album with them, they went on tour with Dark Funeral and Bal- Sagoth. Two days after that tour ended, she was also invited to play keyboards and sing backing vocals on Therion's world tour in support of their Theli album. With Therion, she toured with bands like Amorphis, Sentenced and My Dying Bride as well as playing major European festivals like Dynamo Open Air. In 1997 she was also asked to join Dimmu Borgir as a session keyboardist where they went on to tour to promote their album, Enthrone Darkness Triumphant. During the tour with In Flames in August 1997, she met guitarist Jesper Str√∂mblad and together they formed the first incarnation of Sinergy. She moved to Sweden in 1998 to rehearse with the first line-up of the band and proceeded to record their debut album, Beware the Heavens. She then went on to temporarily play keyboards for Children of Bodom during their 1998 European tour while their own keyboardist was occupied with school. Shortly after, she relocated once again and moved to Finland, where together with original band member Alexi Laiho, they reformed Sinergy with Finnish musicians. Over the years Sinergy has teamed up to tour with the likes of Nightwish, Angra, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames and Children of Bodom. They've also played some of the biggest metal festivals in the world including Wacken Open Air. The success of Sinergy in Japan resulted in Goss receiving an offer to write a monthly column for over three years in Burrn! magazine, the country's most popular music publication. Goss has also made contributions to other bands, writing some lyrics for Children of Bodom on three of their albums, and lending her voice to guest sing with other artists, including Warmen, Eternal Tears of Sorrow, To/Die/For, Exhumation, Kyl√§hullut and The Wicked. The fourth Sinergy album, Sins of the Past, began production in 2004, but due to Children of Bodom's busy schedule the album was never completed. Alexi Laiho stated in an interview with Ultimate-Guitar.com in February 2011 that Sinergy is now defunct. In mid-2011, Kimberly began scoring background music for various TV shows that have aired on The CW, ABC Family, Freeform, Syfy and MTV, among others.  Personal life  Goss was in a long term relationship with and eventually married guitarist Alexi Laiho, who plays lead guitar for both Sinergy and Children of Bodom (in which Alexi also does lead vocals). The couple separated in 2004, although they still remain close friends. They both share identical tattoos of a coiled snake around their ring fingers and also have each other's initials tattooed on the upper part of their left arms.

The signalling appliances and tracks are sometimes collectively referred to as an interlocking plant. An interlocking is designed so that it is impossible to display a signal to proceed unless the route to be used is proven safe. In North America, the official railroad definition of interlocking is: \\"An arrangement of signals and signal appliances so interconnected that their movements must succeed each other in proper sequence\\". Definitions.  Configuration and use  299x299px A minimal interlocking consists of signals, but usually includes additional appliances such as points and Facing Point locks (US: switches) and derails, and may include crossings at grade and movable bridges. Some of the fundamental principles of interlocking include: * Signals may not be operated to permit conflicting train movements to take place at the same time on set route. * Switches and other appliances in the route must be properly 'set' (in position) before a signal may allow train movements to enter that route. * Once a route is set and a train is given a signal to proceed over that route, all switches and other movable appliances in the route are locked in position until either ** the train passes out of the portion of the route affected, or ** the signal to proceed is withdrawn and sufficient time has passed to ensure that a train approaching that route has had opportunity to come to a stop before passing the signal. History Railway interlocking is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby received the first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby & Farmer)The first manufacturer of signal equipment, the predecessor of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd, and today‚Äôs Westinghouse Rail Systems, Ltd. (headquartered in Chippenham, Wiltshire) was awarded a patent for what is known today in North America as ‚Äúpreliminary latch locking‚Äù. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 mechanical locking levers were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone. The first experiment with mechanical interlocking in the United States took place in 1875 by J. M. Toucey and William Buchanan at Spuyten Duyvil Junction in New York on the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad (NYC&HRR;). At the time, Toucey was General Superintendent and Buchanan was Superintendent of Machinery on the NYC&HRR.; Toucey and Buchanan formed the Toucey and Buchanan Interlocking Switch and Signal Company in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1878. The first important installations of their mechanism were on the switches and signals of the Manhattan Elevated Railroad Company and the New York Elevated Railroad Company in 1877-78. Compared to Saxby's design, Toucey and Buchanans' interlocking mechanism was more cumbersome and less sophisticated, and so was not implemented very widely. Union Switch & Signal bought their company in 1882. As technology advanced that served to augment the muscle strength of human beings the railway signaling industry looked to incorporate these new technologies into interlockings to increase the speed of route setting, the number of appliances controlled from a single point and to expand the distance that those same appliances could be operated from the point of control. The challenge facing the signal industry was achieving the same level of safety and reliability that was inherent to purely mechanical systems. An experimental hydro-pneumaticA system whereby compressed water and air are used to transmit action from one end of a long tube to the other end. It can be effective, but it still qualifies as a mechanical system since the pressure is pre-loaded, and requires human action of the same sort that a pure mechanical system requires. interlocking was installed at the Bound Brook, New Jersey junction of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1884. By 1891, there were 18 hydro-pneumatic plants, on six railroads, operating a total of 482 levers. The installations worked, but there were serious defects in the design, and little saving of labour was achieved. The inventors of the hydro-pneumatic system moved forward to an electro-pneumatic system in 1891 and this system, best identified with the Union Switch & Signal Company, was first installed on the Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad at its drawbridge across the Chicago River. By 1900, 54 electro-pneumatic interlocking plants, controlling a total of 1,864 interlocking levers, were in use on 13 North American railroads. This type of system would remain one of two viable competing systems into the future, although it did have the disadvantage of needing extra single-use equipment and requiring high maintenance. Interlockings using electric motors for moving switches and signals became viable in 1894, when Siemens in Austria installed the first such interlocking at P≈ôerov (now in the Czech Republic).Lexikon der gesamten Technik, entry \\"Stellwerke\\" Another interlocking of this type was installed in Westend near Berlin in 1896. In North America, the first installation of an interlocking plant using electric switch machines was at Eau Claire, Wisconsin on the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway in 1901, by General Railway Signal Company (GRS, now a unit of Alstom, headquartered in Levallois-Perret, near Paris). By 1913, this type system had been installed on 83 railroads in 35 US States and Canadian Provinces, in 440 interlocking plants using 21,370 levers.  Interlocking types  Interlockings can be categorized as mechanical, electrical (electro-mechanical or relay-based), or electronic/computer-based. = Mechanical interlocking = A view of the locking bed inside Deval Tower, Des Plaines, Illinois In mechanical interlocking plants, a locking bed is constructed, consisting of steel bars forming a grid. The levers that operate switches, derails, signals or other appliances are connected to the bars running in one direction. The bars are constructed so that if the function controlled by a given lever conflicts with that controlled by another lever, mechanical interference is set up in the cross locking between the two bars, in turn preventing the conflicting lever movement from being made. In purely mechanical plants, the levers operate the field devices, such as signals, directly via a mechanical rodding or wire connection. The levers are about shoulder height since they must supply a mechanical advantage for the operator. Cross locking of levers was effected such that the extra leverage could not defeat the locking (preliminary latch lock). The first mechanical interlocking was installed in 1843 at Bricklayers Arms Junction, England. = Electro-mechanical interlocking = Power interlockings may also use mechanical locking to ensure the proper sequencing of levers, but the levers are considerably smaller as they themselves do not directly control the field devices. If the lever is free to move based on the locking bed, contacts on the levers actuate the switches and signals which are operated electrically or electro-pneumatically. Before a control lever may be moved into a position which would release other levers, a signal must be received from the field element that it has actually moved into the position requested. The locking bed shown is for a GRS power interlocking machine. = Relay interlocking = Part of a relay interlocking using miniature plug-in relays Interlockings effected purely electrically (sometimes referred to as \\"all-electric\\") consist of complex circuitry made up of relays in an arrangement of relay logic that ascertain the state or position of each signal appliance. As appliances are operated, their change of position opens some circuits that lock out other appliances that would conflict with the new position. Similarly, other circuits are closed when the appliances they control become safe to operate. Equipment used for railroad signalling tends to be expensive because of its specialized nature and fail- safe design. Interlockings operated solely by electrical circuitry may be operated locally or remotely, with the large mechanical levers of previous systems being replaced by buttons, switches or toggles on a panel or video interface. Such an interlocking may also be designed to operate without a human operator. These arrangements are termed automatic interlockings, and the approach of a train sets its own route automatically, provided no conflicting movements are in progress. GRS manufactured the first all-relay interlocking system in 1929. It was installed in Lincoln, Nebraska on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Control panel for a US&S; relay interlocking Entrance-Exit Interlocking (NX) was the original brand name of the first generation relay-based centralized traffic control (CTC) interlocking system introduced in 1936 by GRS (represented in Europe by Metropolitan-Vickers). The advent of all electric interlocking technology allowed for more automated route setting procedures as opposed to having an operator line each part of the route manually. The NX system allowed an operator looking at the diagram of a complicated junction to simply push a button on the known entrance track and another button on the desired exit track. The logic circuitry handled all the necessary actions of commanding the underlying relay interlocking to set signals and throw switches in the proper sequence, as required to provide valid route through the interlocking plant. The first NX installation was in 1937 at Brunswick on the Cheshire Lines, UK. The first US installation was on the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) at Girard Junction, Ohio in 1937. Another NYCRR installation was on the main line between Utica, New York and Rochester, New York, and this was quickly followed up by three installations on the New York City Subway's IND Fulton Street Line in 1948. Other NX style systems were implemented by other railroad signal providers. For example, Union Route (UR) was the brand name of their Entrance-Exit system supplied by Union Switch & Signal Co. (US&S;), and introduced in 1951. NX type systems and their costly pre-solid state control logic only tended to be installed in the busier or more complicated terminal areas where it could increase capacity and reduce staffing requirements. In a move that was popular in Europe, the signalling for an entire area was condensed into a single large power signal box with a control panel in the operator's area and the equivalent of a telephone exchange in the floors below that combined the vital relay based interlocking logic and non-vital control logic in one place. Such advanced schemes would also include train describer and train tracking technologies. Away from complex terminals unit lever control systems remained popular until the 1980s when solid state interlocking and control systems began to replace the older relay plants of all types. = Electronic interlocking = Computer- based controls for a modern electronic interlocking Modern interlockings (those installed since the late 1980s) are generally solid state, where the wired networks of relays are replaced by software logic running on special- purpose control hardware. The fact that the logic is implemented by software rather than hard-wired circuitry greatly facilitates the ability to make modifications when needed by reprogramming rather than rewiring. In many implementations, this vital logic is stored as firmware or in ROM that cannot be easily altered to both resist unsafe modification and meet regulatory safety testing requirements. At this time there were also changes in the systems that controlled interlockings. Whereas before technologies such as NX and Automatic Route Setting required racks and racks of relays and other devices, solid state software based systems could handle such functions with less cost and physical footprint. Initially processor driven Unit Lever and NX panels could be set up to command field equipment of either electronic or relay type; however as display technology improved, these hard wired physical devices could be updated with visual display units, which allowed changes in field equipment be represented to the signaller without any hardware modifications. Solid State Interlocking (SSI) is the brand name in trade of work of the first generation microprocessor-based interlocking developed in the 1980s by British Rail, GEC-General Signal and Westinghouse Signals Ltd in the UK. Second generation processor-based interlockings are known by the term \\"Computer Based Interlocking\\" (CBI), of which VPI (trademark of General Railway Signal, now Alstom), MicroLok (trademark of Union Switch & Signal, now Ansaldo STS), Westlock and Westrace (trademarks of Invensys Rail, now Siemens), and [Smartlock] (trademark of Alstom), and EBI Lock (trademark of Bombardier) are examples.  Defined forms of locking  ;Electric locking: \\"The combination of one or more electric locks or controlling circuits by means of which levers in an interlocking machine, or switches or other devices operated in connection with signalling and interlocking, are secured against operation under certain conditions.\\"Defined by the Railway Signal Association, which today is the Railway Signal Committee of the Association of American Railroads. ;Section locking: \\"Electric locking effective while a train occupies a given section of a route and adapted to prevent manipulation of levers that would endanger the train while it is within that section.\\" ;Route locking: \\"Electric locking taking effect when a train passes a signal and adapted to prevent manipulation of levers that would endanger the train while it is within the limits of the route entered.\\" ;Sectional route locking: \\"Route locking so arranged that a train, in clearing each section of the route, releases the locking affecting that section.\\" ;Approach locking: \\"Electric locking effective while a train is approaching a signal that has been set for it to proceed and adapted to prevent manipulation of levers or devices that would endanger that train.\\" ;Stick locking: \\"Electric locking taking effect upon the setting of a signal for a train to proceed, released by a passing train, and adapted to prevent manipulation of levers that would endanger an approaching train.\\" ;Indication locking: \\"Electric locking adapted to prevent any manipulation of levers that would bring about an unsafe condition in case a signal, switch, or other operated device fails to make a movement corresponding with that of the operating lever; or adapted directly to prevent the operation of one device in case another device, to be operated first, fails to make the required movement.\\" ;Check locking or traffic locking: \\"Electric locking that enforces cooperation between the Operators at two adjacent plants in such a manner that prevents opposing signals governing the same track from being set to proceed at the same time. In addition, after a signal has been cleared and accepted by a train, check locking prevents an opposing signal at the adjacent interlocking plant from being cleared until the train has passed through that plant.\\"  Complete and incomplete interlockings (U.S. terminology)  Interlockings allow trains to cross from one track to another using a turnout and a series of switches. Railroad terminology defines the following types of interlockings as either complete or incomplete depending on the movements available. Although timetables generally do not identify an interlocking as one or the other, and rule books do not define the terms, the terms below are generally agreed upon by system crews and rules officials. ;Complete interlockings: allow continuous movements from any track on one side of the interlocking to any track on the opposite side without the use of a reverse move within the limits of the interlocking. This is true even if there are differing numbers of tracks on opposing sides, or if the interlocking has multiple sides. ;Incomplete interlockings: do not allow such movements as described above. Movements in an incomplete interlocking may be limited and may even require reverse movements to achieve the desired route.

This is particularly important in compulsory arbitration systems of industrial relations, as in Australia; where only one union may be the registered representative of a particular classification of worker. The term is also applied to disputes in assigning credit for significant discoveries in science, in particular the recognition of such credit by major awards such as the Nobel Prize. Notable Nobel Prize controversies include the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to James D. Watson, Francis H. C. Crick, and Maurice Wilkins for their discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It has been argued that the award failed to give appropriate credit to Rosalind Franklin for her X-ray crystallography on the DNA molecule, which evidence is acknowledged to have been critical to the discovery. It is acknowledged in this case that the Nobel Prize may not be shared among more than three persons, and is not given to deceased persons (Franklin had died in 1958). A second notable example is the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics, awarded to Antony Hewish and Martin Ryle but not to Jocelyn Bell Burnell. Bell, as a doctoral student under the direction of Hewish, made the primary observations that lead to recognition of the phenomenon of pulsars. Burnell herself has stated \\"[I]t would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases ....\\".

The O-Bahn system was conceived by Daimler-Benz to enable buses to avoid traffic congestion by sharing tram tunnels in the German city of Essen. Adelaide's O-Bahn was introduced in 1986 to service the city's rapidly expanding north- eastern suburbs, replacing an earlier plan for a tramway extension. The O-Bahn provides specially built track, combining elements of both bus and rail systems. Adelaide's track is long and includes three interchanges at Klemzig, Paradise and Tea Tree Plaza. Interchanges allow buses to enter and exit the busway and to continue on suburban routes, avoiding the need for passengers to transfer to another bus to continue their journey. Buses can travel at a maximum speed of , but are now restricted to 85 km/h (53 mph). , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday. An additional section including a tunnel opened in 2017 at the city end to reduce the number of congested intersections buses must traverse to enter the Adelaide city centre. The development of the O-Bahn busway led to the development of the Torrens Linear Park from a run-down urban drain into an attractive public open space. It has also triggered urban development around the north-eastern terminus at Modbury. Track A section of track used for testing O-Bahn buses The O-Bahn track is made of concrete; it is elevated from the ground because of the poor quality of alluvial soils along the River Torrens, which frequently move due to their high level of plasticity. On top of the pylons are concrete sleepers on which the track runs. 5,600 pylons were drilled in place to support 5,600 sleepers and 4,200 prefabricated L-shaped track pieces, sited at intervals. Concrete pylons were cast into the ground to ensure stability, to a depth of up to . The width of both tracks, sitting on the sleepers, is .Northeast Busway Project (Brochure). South Australian Department of Transport (1983).Busway Information, Paper Two: O-Bahn Guided Bus Concept. South Australian Department of Transport (1983). The O-Bahn's concrete tracks were narrower and lighter than those of the initially proposed light rail development, and put less stress on the land. The concrete components were precast and then laid onto piers. At the city end, the O-Bahn begins at East Terrace, as an extension eastwards from Grenfell Street into the parklands. The O-Bahn enters an tunnel, completed in December 2017, which curves from east to north, emerging onto bus lanes in the middle of Hackney Road just north of the intersection with Botanic Road and North Terrace. The bus lanes continue north to the Torrens River and into the original entrance of the O-Bahn on Hackney Road, opposite the East Parklands, where it enters a tunnel at a speed limited to , due to the tight initial corner, ensuring that the rear tyres (especially trailer tyres of articulated buses) do not 'scrub' against the track. Speed is gradually increased to for most of the trip to Klemzig Interchange. Once en route to Paradise Interchange, the speed limit was up to , but has been limited to since late 2012. On some sections was achieved in tests. The average service speed including stops is about . On entering interchanges the O-Bahn ends and the speed limit is . In the interchange area, the speed limit is . The O-Bahn is officially considered a road, due to a court ruling in the early years of the system's operation. This ruling permits the South Australia Police to install speed cameras and fine speeding drivers. Cars entering the O-Bahn are deterred by a large number of signs at entrance points and a \\"sump buster\\" device that rips out a car's sump (oil pan) if it gets onto the track. An average of four cars per year enter the O-Bahn and must be removed by crane. 180¬∞ panorama showing the O-Bahn track and a bus as it crosses the River Torrens at Dunstan Adventure Playground in St Peters Buses Scania K320UA The first buses to enter service on the O-Bahn were 41 rigid and 51 articulated Mercedes-Benz O305s. These were modified for O-Bahn use by Mitsubishi Motors' Clovelly Park plant before being bodied by Pressed Metal Corporation South Australia. The cost was included in the original $98 million budget. Modified MAN SG280s and SL202s were later purchased. Guide-wheel With the Mercedes-Benz O305s approaching their 25-year age limit, tenders were called in 2007 for replacements. The new buses were Scania K230UB/K280UB rigid and Scania K320UA articulated buses bodied by Custom Coaches. , these along with one MAN SL202, and one Mercedes- Benz O405NH make up the fleet. In the case of breakdowns, a specially designed vehicle nicknamed 'Dumbo' is used to tow buses from the O-Bahn. In the early stages of design it was intended that all buses would have towing ability; however, this was soundly rejected by the drivers' union and 'Dumbo' was purchased. If a tyre blows during a trip the guide-wheel prevents the bus from erratic movement, and a smaller aluminium inner tyre allows the bus to be driven to the nearest station at . The guide-wheel, which protrudes just ahead of the front wheels, is the most important part of the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide- wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts. Since June 2018, services are operated by Torrens Transit under contract to Adelaide Metro. , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday. Interchanges Tea Tree Plaza Interchange Klemzig Interchange is the first station, three kilometres (1.8 mi) from the city centre in the suburb of Klemzig. It was built as a connector to the city loop 'Circle Line' bus service, which followed the Adelaide outer ring route. Many bus services bypass Klemzig and the station has limited capacity. It contains a Park & Ride carpark with 450 spaces. Paradise Interchange is the second station, six kilometres (3.7 mi) from the city centre, in the suburb of Paradise. The terminus before the completion of Stage 2, it is now served by buses from suburban streets, and has a total of 875 car parking spaces in two areas. Tea Tree Plaza Interchange is the terminus, from the city centre, in Modbury. Adjacent to the Westfield Tea Tree Plaza, it is the largest O-Bahn station. Bus services from this interchange connect to areas as far away as Elizabeth and service the Golden Grove area. It has 700 car parking spaces, after a multiple level carpark was built during a redevelopment in 2013. Route O-Bahn's southern entrance on Hackney Road Outbound O-Bahn bus routes travel through the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, and enter the O-Bahn via the tunnel (opened on 10 December 2017) through the Adelaide Park Lands in Rymill Park. They then exit the tunnel on Hackney Road, north of the intersection with Dequetteville Terrace, and then proceed northwards along the road in designated bus lanes. Along this stretch the Adelaide Botanic Garden is on the left, followed by Botanic Park. Hackney Road‚Äîalong with the designated O-Bahn bus lanes‚Äîcrosses a bridge over the River Torrens, with the bus lanes veering easterly, to the northbound entrance of the guided O-Bahn busway. The busway dips below the surface road (Park Road) to join the inbound (southbound) track, both heading northeast. The busway follows roughly the Torrens River valley, but with smoother curves. This means that it crosses the river quite often, with either a park or a few houses on a point surrounded by the river and busway. This occurs a total of eight times before the busway reaches Klemzig Interchange on the north side of the river. The busway crosses the river again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part of the suburbs of Campbelltown and Paradise to its north between the busway and the river before reaching Paradise Interchange. After Paradise Interchange, the busway passes under Darley Road, then over the Torrens for the last time. The terrain becomes steeper as the busway proceeds up along the outflow creek and past the northwestern side of the Hope Valley Reservoir. It proceeds north under Grand Junction Road, then swings east and north again to enter the eastern side of the Westfield Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre precinct, where the guided busway ends at Tea Tree Plaza Interchange. Most buses continue on normal roads to service suburbs further afield. All listed routes connect Adelaide City Centre to the named endpoint, but service different suburbs between the O-Bahn interchange and that endpoint. History =Planning= The greater Adelaide area experienced significant growth during and after World War II. Between 1944 and 1965, the area's population doubled,Greater Adelaide's population increased from 365,000 in 1944 to 748,000 in 1965. \\"Population Distribution\\". 3105.0.65.001 Australian Historical Population Statistics, 2014. Australian Bureau of Statistics. and the number of private motor vehicle registrations increased 43-fold. In 1955, the state government under Premier Sir Thomas Playford established a Town Planning Committee and commissioned a coordinated plan to guide the future development of Adelaide. The resulting 300-page study, \\"Report on the Metropolitan Area of Adelaide 1962\\", laid out a 30-year development plan, including a proposed of improved roadways. Shortly before leaving office in 1965, Playford commissioned a detailed study focusing on the recommended transportation improvements. In 1968, the government received the \\"Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study\\". The MATS plan envisaged a network of 10 freeways crossing the metropolitan area, a rapid rail network, and an underground city loop railway. MATS drew massive public opposition, as it called for the acquisition of thousands of properties and would effectively supplant a number of suburbs that were to become the sites of interchanges. Arguments broke out in Parliament, and widespread images of gridlock in overseas freeway networks contributed to the furore. Nonetheless, in early 1969 Premier Steele Hall approved implementation of the plan in a modified format, and the government began to purchase property along the proposed corridors. In mid-1969, faced with ongoing opposition, the state abandoned plans for 2 of the 10 proposed freeways. Hall was voted out of office in 1970, and the new government under Premier Don Dunstan passed a 10-year moratorium on freeway development, effectively shelving MATS. The already-acquired corridors were retained for potential future use. By the mid-1970s, transportation had become a problem in the north-east suburbs. The population of the Tea Tree Gully region had increased from 2,500 in 1954 to 35,000 by 1971. A corridor of land along the River Torrens from Adelaide to Modbury, originally purchased for the Modbury Freeway proposed under the MATS plan, was the subject of a new proposal in 1973 when the State Director- General of Transport suggested building a heavy rail line that would connect the suburb to the Adelaide railway system. A subsequent study, the \\"North East Adelaide Public Transport Review\\" (NEAPTR), considered heavy rail, light rail, busways, and freeways, ultimately concluding that a light rail line or busway would be most viable. The state government decided on a light rail proposal to extend the historic Glenelg tram. The new route was to continue along King William Street beyond what was then the terminus in Victoria Square and weave through the Adelaide Park Lands to the Modbury corridor.Wilson, Tom. Items of Interest for Planning of Luton Dunstable Translink, Appendix A: Report on Adelaide O-Bahn. (Tom Wilson was the Principal Consultant Service Development & Busway Operations Manager 1981‚Äì1989.)Busway Information, Paper One: Background History of the Northeast Corridor Transportation Proposals. South Australian Department of Transport (1983). The light rail system would connect with feeder buses at stations along the length of the corridor to transfer passengers to suburban routes. New light rail vehicles were to be bought to replace the ageing 1929 H type trams. Public opposition to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan on the basis that it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister. =Development= Bus entering the Klemzig Interchange In search of a replacement for the light rail project, the new Government sent experts to examine an innovative guided bus system being developed in West Germany by Daimler-Benz. From the German Omnibus (bus) and Bahn (path or way, as in Autobahn for automobiles and Eisenbahn or just Bahn for railway, e.g. S-Bahn and U-Bahn),\\"O-Bahn, n.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2015. Accessed 11 August 2015. the O-Bahn system was developed for use in tram tunnels in Essen. After extensive consultations with German authorities, State Transport Authority engineers decided the O-Bahn could be used. The system was seen as far superior to previous proposals; it used less land, made less noise, was faster and cost less. In addition, its unique feature of a non-transfer service direct from suburban streets to the city centre made it more attractive. Plans were drawn up for a length of : initially only were to be constructed as O-Bahn, with the rest being conventional busway. However, safety concerns and public opposition led to O-Bahn being used for the entire length. Construction began in 1983 for the first section to Paradise Interchange. Another change of Government in 1982 resulted in uncertainty over the future of the project. The John Bannon Government, after consultations, decided to continue with Stage 1 (City to Paradise) and in 1986 proceeded with Stage 2 (Paradise to Tea Tree Plaza).Northeast Busway (Brochure). State (South Australia) Transport Authority (1990).O-Bahn Busway Information (Brochure). South Australian Department of Transport (1987). The cost of the project was A$98 million, including the buses.Busway Information, Paper Four: Environment. South Australian Department of Transport (1983). The O-Bahn had more than 4 million passenger trips in the year after completion of Stage 1 in 1986, with a 30% increase the following year. When the completed O-Bahn was opened on 20 August 1989, passenger numbers rose another 17%. The Adelaide public transport system was privatised in the 1990s and overall patronage across all systems (bus, rail and tram) dropped 25%. The exception to this was the O-Bahn with no decrease, and there were 19,500 passenger trips daily in 1996 (7.13 million a year). , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday. =Expansion proposals= Students boarding O-Bahn buses at Klemzig Interchange There have been a number of proposals to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.Busway Information, Paper Three: Operational Strategy. South Australian Department of Transport (1983). A southern O-Bahn proposal attracted the most attention and has been the subject of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viability since 1996. The rail route through Adelaide's far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route. An O-Bahn running direct through the region would be able to take advantage of an already large population and the continuing growth in the area. One suggested route for an O-Bahn was for an alignment adjacent to the Noarlunga Centre railway line from the city to the Tonsley railway line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn would require moving the railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood tram overpass would require alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182 million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001.\\"High cost derails southern O-Bahn\\". The Advertiser (Adelaide). 16 March 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on road upgrades and an inner-city light rail extension.Pengelley, Jill; Zed, Tom (16 October 2009). \\"South Road Superway to connect Regency Rd, Port River Expressway\\". The Advertiser (Adelaide). Retrieved 16 July 2010. There was a 2009 plan that bus routes serving the O-Bahn would be enhanced from Hackney Road along Grenfell and Currie Streets and extended to West Terrace on the far side of the CBD along dedicated bus lanes. However, the Federal Government announced in January 2011, as part of its response to the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods, that the extension would be cancelled \\"as a result of a significant scope reduction of the original project, resulting in only limited transport benefits\\". =O-Bahn City Access Project= The O-Bahn Busway tunnel travels under Rymill Park and Rundle Park In 2015, the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure announced a $160 million proposed O-Bahn City Access Project. The existing entry/exit at Hackney Road was retained, but upgraded bus-only lanes on Hackney Road now lead to a new tunnel portal with bus guide rails commencing near the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The tunnel passes under the Botanic Road intersection, then curves west under Rundle Park, Rundle Road and surfaces in Rymill Park leading to a redesigned intersection at Grenfell Street and East Terrace. Construction started in late 2015 and completed in 2017. The contract to complete the detailed design and construct the tunnel was let to McConnell Dowell in October 2015. SAGE Automation provided expertise in the mechanical and electrical aspects of the tunnel including ventilation and safety systems. Construction started in March 2016 with the removal of the median strip and preparation of central bus lanes. The tunnel opened on 10 December 2017, with limited services starting the next day. It started full operation on 17 December. Effects on local development The O-Bahn has caused a clustering of commercial and community development near the Tea Tree Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area's easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre. Market imperatives have also been aided by the zoning of the land around the area as commercial rather than residential. The area around Tea Tree Plaza is one of five designated regional centres within the Adelaide metropolis. According to Robert Cervero, the O-Bahn has \\"accelerated the conversion of Tea Tree Gully from a somewhat sterile new town designed around a regional shopping mall to an emerging urban village featuring a wide range of land uses\\". The large Modbury Hospital is adjacent to the interchange, and the Torrens Valley campus of TAFE was built directly to the east of the busway after it opened. One government high school, three primary schools, one Christian school and three retirement villages are within a kilometre of the interchange.UBD Adelaide street directory, pp. 84, 96. In contrast, there has been opposition to the area surrounding Klemzig Interchange and Paradise Interchange being used for any purpose other than low-density housing and no transit-oriented development has occurred. Environment Linear Park near Paradise Interchange The construction of the O-Bahn, rather than the previously proposed Modbury Freeway, was motivated by a desire to reduce car dependency. $6 million was used for the redevelopment of the Torrens Gorge, in which the Torrens Linear Park was created. About 150,000 trees, plants and shrubs were planted alongside the track for aesthetic, environmental and noise-reduction purposes; planting was completed in 1997. Walking trails and cycling paths were built along the park to encourage public use. Torrens Linear Park rejuvenated the river, which had deteriorated to the extent of being a de facto \\"urban drain, littered with rubbish and inaccessible to the public\\". Arising from environmental considerations, the O-Bahn is carbon-neutral due to the absorption of carbon dioxide by the trees alongside it. The track itself is situated in a valley due to it being near a riverbed and the elevation was further lowered by digging further depressions in order to reduce the noise impact on adjacent dwellings. The original buses ran on diesel fuel, but the system allows for buses that run on alternative energy sources. Biodiesel fuel and natural gas have been trialled, and 20% of the Adelaide bus fleet uses compressed natural gas, 48% B20 and 32% B5 biodiesel blends. The design of the O-Bahn allows for the installation of overhead wires for trolleybuses.

It contains the earliest surviving music written specifically for keyboard. The term codex is somewhat misleading: the musical section of the source comprises only two leaves, bound together with a larger manuscript from Robertsbridge, Sussex, England.Caldwell, \\"Keyboard music: I.1.\\" It contains six pieces, three of them in the form of the estampie, an Italian dance form of the Trecento, as well as three arrangements of motets. Two of the motets are from the Roman de Fauvel. All of the music is anonymous, and all is written in tablature. Most of the music for the estampies is for two voices, often in parallel fifths, and also using hocket technique. Most likely the instrument used to play the pieces in the Codex was the organ. Formerly the date of the Codex was presumed to be around 1330,Gilbert Reaney, Manuscripts of Polyphonic Music (c. 1320-1400), RISM B/IV/2 (Munich: Henle Verlag, 1969). but more recent research has suggested a later date, slightly after mid-century.E. H. Roesner: Introduction to Philippe de Vitry: Complete Works (Monaco, 1984) The manuscript was considered Italian and connected to the main streams of the Italian trecento in its contents and in its clear use of puncti divisionis (dots of division).

History =World War II= Capitaine (SS-336) was launched 1 October 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. J. A. Rondomanski; commissioned 26 January 1945, Lieutenant Commander E. S. Friedrick in command; and assigned to the Pacific Fleet. Capitaine got underway from New London 7 March 1945 to arrive at Pearl Harbor 15 April. On 6 May, she cleared for her first war patrol, off the coast of Indochina north of Saigon. Enemy targets were disappointingly few for a new submarine, for the Navy had almost completely swept the sea of Japanese shipping by this time. On 16 June, she rescued from the sea five Japanese survivors of a merchant ship previously sunk by other forces. After refueling at Subic Bay, Capitaine continued her patrol south of Borneo in the Java Sea. On 30 June, she joined in a concerted gun attack on five small enemy craft, one (Bandai Maru) which she sank after its crew had abandoned it. Refitted at Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia, Capitaine sailed for her second war patrol, arriving in her assigned area just three days before hostilities ended. =Post war= She returned to the west coast in September 1945, but in January 1946 was bound for the Far East once more, training in Philippine waters through March. A month of operations at Pearl Harbor preceded her return to San Diego, from which, after an overhaul, she made two simulated war patrols in 1947 and 1948, and conducted local training and services. The submarine was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 10 February 1950. Capitaine was recommissioned 23 February 1957, and reported to the Pacific Fleet a month later. From her base at San Diego, she took part in training, served other fleet units as target in antisubmarine exercises, and training reservists, as well as voyaging to the Far East for 7th Fleet duty, through 1960. On 1 July 1960 Capitaine was reclassified an Auxiliary Research Submarine, AGSS-336. In 1964 Capitaine took part in the movie In Harm's Way. Capitaine received one battle star for World War II service. = Alfredo Cappellini (S 507) = Capitaine was decommissioned, 4 March 1966 and transferred (loaned) to Italy, 5 March 1966, where she was recommissioned in the Italian Navy as Alfredo Cappellini (S 507). She was sold to Italy and struck from the US Naval Register, 5 December 1977, and disposed of.

P. Lovecraft's fiction and is, presumably, an alter ego of Lovecraft himself. The character first appears in \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\", a short story Lovecraft wrote in 1919 based on one of his dreams. An American magazine called The Vagrant published the story in May 1920. Carter shares many of Lovecraft's personal traits: He is an uncelebrated author, whose writings are seldom noticed. A melancholy figure, Carter is a quiet contemplative dreamer with a sensitive disposition, prone to fainting during times of emotional stress. But he can also be courageous, with enough strength of mind and character to face and foil the horrific creatures of the Dreamlands, as described in the stories of the Dream Cycle. Stories In Lovecraft's writings, Carter appears or is mentioned in the following tales, listed in the fictional chronology.  Character biography  Randolph Carter is an antiquarian and one-time student of the fictional Miskatonic University. Based on clues from various stories, he was probably born around 1874 and grew up in and around Boston. At the age of nine, he underwent a mysterious experience at his great-uncle Christopher's farm and thereafter exhibited a gift of prophecy. He is the descendant of Sir Randolph Carter, who had studied magic during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Sir Randolph had then emigrated to America and his son Edmund Carter later had to flee the Salem witch-trials. Carter also had an ancestor involved in one of the Crusades, who was captured by the Muslims and learned \\"wild secrets\\" from them. Carter served in the French Foreign Legion during the First World War, and was badly wounded in fighting near Belloy-en-Santerre in 1916, presumably during the Battle of the Somme in which the Legion participated. Poet Alan Seeger perished there in the Foreign Legion on the first day of the Somme, and Lovecraft may well have had Seeger in mind; Lovecraft penned a poem to Seeger's memory in 1918. \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" is narrated in flashback by Carter while being interrogated by the police, who suspect him of murdering Harley Warren. Carter and his friend Harley Warren investigate a mysterious crypt in an ancient abandoned cemetery. Warren believes the crypt may contain evidence that could confirm some of his speculations (details of these speculations are never revealed, but it is said that Warren recently read a mysterious book written in an unknown language about incorruptibility of the dead).\\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" in H. P. Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels, S.T. Joshi, ed. (Arkham House: Sauk City, Wisconsin, 1964) p. 300. Upon reaching the cemetery, Carter and Warren uncover the crypt by lifting an immense granite slab, revealing a set of stone steps leading downward into the earth. Warren insists that Carter remain at the surface. He descends the steps alone, but remains in communication with Carter via a portable telephone set. Shortly thereafter he tells Carter that he has discovered a monstrous unbelievable secret and pleads with his companion to replace the stone and run for his life. When Carter asks what he has found, his queries are initially met with silence and then by the voice of an unknown entity who informs him that Warren is dead. The story is almost verbatim from one of Lovecraft's nightmares, with but minor changes like the name \\"Lovecraft\\" to \\"Carter\\". \\"The Unnamable\\" begins with Carter in conversation with his friend Joel Manton, principal of a New England high school, discussing the supposedly mythical creature that bears the story's name. The tale is set in a seventeenth-century cemetery as evening falls. Initially, Manton is skeptical and ridicules Carter for thinking that such a being may be possible. As darkness encroaches ‚Äì and as Carter's descriptions become more detailed and supported by facts ‚Äì his flippant dismissal gradually gives way to fear. The two are attacked by the monster but survive the experience. \\"The Unnameable\\" is notable for containing extensive quoted dialog between the characters, something which Lovecraft scarcely used at all in the rest of his fiction. There is some question as to whether \\"The Unnamable's\\" protagonist is in fact Randolph Carter; he is named only as \\"Carter\\" and described as an author of weird fiction.See \\"Unnamable, The,\\" S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia (New York: Hippocampus Press, 2001), pp. 283-84. An oblique reference to this incident is found in \\"The Silver Key\\". The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath‚Äìone of Lovecraft's longest tales‚Äìfollows Carter for several months searching for the lost city of his dreams. The story reveals Carter's familiarity with much of Lovecraft's fictional universe. Carter is also shown to possess considerable knowledge of the politics and geography of the dream world and has allies there. After an elaborate odyssey, Carter awakes in his Boston apartment, with only a fleeting impression of the dream world he left behind, though he now knows what the lost city actually is. \\"The Silver Key\\"‚Äîperhaps the most overtly philosophical of Lovecraft's fiction‚Äîfinds Carter entering middle age and losing his \\"key to the gate of dreams.\\" No longer is Carter able to escape the mundane realities of life and enter the Lovecraftian dreamworld that alone has given him happiness. Wonder is gone and he has forgotten the fact that life is nothing more than a set of mental images, where there is no fundamental distinction between dreams and reality and no reason to value one above the other. In an attempt to recover his lost innocence, Carter returns to his childhood home and finds a mysterious silver key, which allows him to enter a cave and magically emerge again in the year 1883 as a child, full of wonder, dreams, and happiness. He remains in this condition until 1928, when he again disappears, presumably having found a way to transcend space and time and travel in other dimensions. \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key,\\" written in collaboration with Lovecraft admirer E. Hoffman Price, details Carter's adventures in another dimension where he encounters a more primordial version of himself (implied to be Yog-Sothoth) who explains that Carter‚Äîand indeed all beings‚Äîare ultimately nothing more than manifestations of a greater being. Carter's mind ends up trapped in the body of an alien, another facet of the higher being. The investigation into Carter's disappearance takes place four years later, in 1932. \\"Out of the Aeons\\" by Lovecraft and Hazel Heald features a brief 1931 appearance by Carter, while trapped in the alien body. He visits a museum exhibiting an ancient mummy from a long-forgotten civilization and recognizes some of the writing on the scroll that accompanies it.

Joshi used the chronology Lovecraft gives in \\"The Silver Key\\" in which the events in \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" took place when Carter was in his late forties. Joshi says it would also explain why he was called a \\"bag of nerves\\" in that story, since it took place after his World War I service in which he was nearly killed and might still have post-traumatic stress disorder.  Real-life influences  Lovecraft's character may have been based on a real-life Randolph Carter, who was a Scholar at Christ's College, in the University of Cambridge, from 1892-1895. Carter took his Part I Tripos in Oriental Studies (Arabic), and his Part II in Egyptology. While at Cambridge, he was an acquaintance of Sir James George Frazer, author of The Golden Bough. Carter's whereabouts after Cambridge are unclear, but, like his fictional namesake, he may have used the French Foreign Legion as a route into exploring the North African deserts. College records do not indicate whether Carter was a US or British citizen.  References  * H. P. Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness. * H. P. Lovecraft, Dagon and Other Macabre Tales.

P. Lovecraft. Begun probably in the autumn of 1926, the draft was completed on January 22, 1927 and it remained unrevised and unpublished in his lifetime. It is both the longest of the stories that make up his Dream Cycle and the longest Lovecraft work to feature protagonist Randolph Carter. Along with his 1927 novel The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, it can be considered one of the significant achievements of that period of Lovecraft's writing. The Dream- Quest combines elements of horror and fantasy into an epic tale that illustrates the scope and wonder of humankind's ability to dream. The story was published posthumously by Arkham House in 1943.Lovecraft, H. P., and Joshi, S. T. (editor): Dreams in the Witch House and Other Weird Stories, page 433. Penguin Classics, 2004. Currently, it is published by Ballantine Books in an anthology that also includes \\"The Silver Key\\" and \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\". The definitive version, with corrected text by S.

Plot Randolph Carter dreams of a majestic city but can not approach it. When he prays to the gods of dream to reveal the city's whereabouts, his dreams of the city stop altogether. Undaunted, Carter resolves to beseech the gods in person at Kadath. However, no one knows where that is. In dream, Carter consults priests in a temple that borders the Dreamlands. They warn Carter of great danger and suggest that the gods purposefully stopped his visions. Carter's knowledge of Dreamlands customs and languages makes his quest comparatively less risky than if done by an amateur, but he must consult entities with a dangerous reputation. The Zoogs, a race of predatory rodents, direct him to Ulthar to find the priest Atal. In the cat-laden city of Ulthar, Atal mentions a huge mountainside carving of the gods' features. Carter realizes the gods' mortal descendants will share those features and presumably be near Kadath. While seeking passage there, Carter is kidnapped by turbaned slavers, who take him to the moon and deliver him to horrible moon-beasts, the servants of malevolent god Nyarlathotep. The cats of Ulthar, Carter's allies, rescue him and return him to a port city. After a long journey, Carter finds the carving, recognizing the visage of the gods in traders who dock at Celepha√Øs. Before he can act on his knowledge, faceless, winged creatures called nightgaunts capture him and leave him to die in the underworld. Friendly ghouls, including Carter's friend Richard Pickman, assist him in returning to the surface by sneaking through the terrible city of the man- eating Gugs. After assisting the cats in repelling a Zoog sneak attack, Carter buys passage to Celepha√Øs and learns from the sailors that the traders come from Inganok,Some versions of the text use \\"Inquanok\\", which came from August Derleth's misreading of Lovecraft's manuscript when he originally published the story. (Harms, \\"Inganok\\", The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana, p. 149). a cold and dark land devoid of cats. Carter meets Celepha√Øs' king, his friend Kuranes, who became a permanent resident of the Dreamlands upon his death in the waking world. Longing for home, he has dreamed parts of his kingdom to resemble his native Cornwall. Kuranes knows the pitfalls of the Dreamlands well but fails to dissuade Carter from his quest. Under the pretense of wishing to work in its quarries, Carter boards a ship bound for Inganok. As they draw near, Carter spots a nameless island from which he hears strange howls. At a breathtaking summit near a quarry, Carter is captured by a merchant he had previously encountered. Monstrous birds fly them over the Plateau of Leng, a vast tableland populated by Pan-like beings. Carter is brought to a monastery inhabited by the dreaded High Priest Not to Be Described. There, Carter learns that the Men of Leng conceal their horns under turbans and are the slavers who captured him. He also learns that the nightgaunts do not serve Nyarlathotep, as is commonly supposed but Nodens, and that even Earth's gods fear them. Carter recoils in horror as he realizes the masked high-priest's true identity. Carter flees through maze-like corridors, wandering through the monastery in pitch-black darkness until he chances on the exit. After rescuing several ghouls from Men of Leng, Carter and ghoul reinforcements attack a moon-beast outpost on the nameless rock. In a nearby city, Carter obtains the services of a flock of nightgaunts to transport himself and the ghouls to the gods' castle on Kadath. After a long flight, Carter arrives at Kadath but finds it empty. A great procession led by a pharaoh-like man arrives. The pharaoh reveals himself as Nyarlathotep and tells Carter that the city of his dreams is the childhood memories of his home city of Boston. The gods of earth have seen the city of Carter's dreams and made it their home, abandoning Kadath and their responsibilities. Impressed with Carter's resolve, Nyarlathotep grants Carter passage to the city to recall the gods of earth, but Carter realizes too late that the mocking Nyarlathotep has tricked him, and he is being taken to the court of Azathoth at the center of the universe. At first believing he is doomed, Carter suddenly remembers that he is in a dream and wakes himself. Nyarlathotep broods over his defeat within the halls of Kadath, mocking in anger the \\"mild gods of earth\\" whom he has snatched back from the sunset city.  Characters  Lovecraft included elements and characters from previous stories, many of which had been influenced by Lord Dunsany, in Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, though they are not always depicted consistently. * Randolph Carter has the ability to enter the Dreamlands, an alternate dimension accessible through dreams. He appears in several other Lovecraft stories: \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\", \\"The Unnamable\\", \\"The Silver Key\\", and \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\". He is modeled after the author himself and represents his philosophical views. * Richard Upton Pickman appears as a ghoul. The character first appeared in \\"Pickman's Model\\" (1927), in which he was still a living human artist. He is reported to have disappeared with his family's copy of the Necronomicon in 1926 in Lovecraft's short story \\"History of the Necronomicon\\". * The priest Atal appears as a boy and youth in two earlier tales, \\"The Cats of Ulthar\\" (1920) and \\"The Other Gods\\" (1933), respectively, which fully describe places and events alluded to in The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath. * Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, is frequently mentioned in Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos tales, but his appearance here is the only time during which Nyarlathotep interacts meaningfully with any of Lovecraft's human characters. Nyarlathotep also appears in the sonnet cycle Fungi from Yuggoth. * Nodens (an Elder God) is also described in \\"The Strange High House in the Mist\\". Fritz Leiber wrote that the gods in Lovecraft's fiction are typically depicted as \\"either malevolent or, at best, cruelly indifferent\\". Nodens is an exception to this, which Leiber says could be an attempt to explain why the more malevolent gods have not overrun humanity. * Kuranes was introduced in the short story \\"Celepha√Øs\\" (1920), as a person who abandoned his earthly life in favor of the Dreamlands. Inspiration Like Lovecraft's novel fragment \\"Azathoth\\" (1922, published 1938), The Dream-Quest appears to have been influenced by Vathek, a 1786 novel by William Thomas Beckford that \\"is similarly an exotic fantasy written without chapter divisions\\".S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia (New York: Hippocampus Press, 2001), p. 74. Critics such as Will Murray and David E. Schultz, in fact, have suggested that The Dream-Quest is in effect a second attempt at completing the abandoned novel Azathoth.Price, The Azathoth Cycle, p. vii. While the influence of the fantasies of Lord Dunsany on Lovecraft's Dream Cycle is often mentioned, Robert M. Price argues that a more direct model for The Dream-Quest is provided by the six Mars (\\"Barsoom\\") novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs that had been published by 1927. It's been noted, however, that there is little in common between John Carter, a classic action hero, outstanding warrior and rescuer of princesses, and Randolph Carter, a melancholy figure, quiet and contemplative, who never actually fights any of his enemies, is captured several times, and needs his friends to rescue him again and again.S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia (New York: Hippocampus Press, 2001), pp. 263-85. Elsewhere, Price maintains that L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) was also a significant influence on The Dream-Quest, pointing out that in both books the main character chooses in the end to return \\"home\\" as the best place to be. An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia cites Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Marble Faun and \\"The Great Stone Face\\" as influences.Joshi and Schultz, p. 107. Reception The Dream-Quest has evoked a broad range of reactions, \\"some HPL enthusiasts finding it almost unreadable and others... comparing it to the Alice books and the fantasies of George MacDonald.\\"Joshi and Schultz, p. 74. Joanna Russ referred to The Dream-Quest as \\"charming... but alas, never rewritten or polished\\".Joanna Russ, \\"Lovecraft, H(oward) P(hilips), in Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers by Curtis C. Smith. St. James Press, 1986, (pp. 461‚Äì3). Lovecraft himself declared that \\"it isn't much good; but forms useful practice for later and more authentic attempts in the novel form.\\" He expressed concern while writing it that \\"Randolph Carter's adventures may have reached the point of palling on the reader; or that the very plethora of weird imagery may have destroyed the power of any one image to produce the desired impression of strangeness.\\"H. P. Lovecraft, Selected Letters Vol. 2, pp. 94-95; cited in Joshi and Schultz, p. 74. In 1948, Arthur C. Clarke sent Lord Dunsany a copy of The Arkham Sampler containing part of The Dream-Quest. Dunsany responded: \\"I see Lovecraft borrowed my style, & I don't grudge it to him\\".Darrell Schweitzer, Review of Keith Allan Daniels, \\"Arthur C. Clarke & Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence by Keith Allen Daniels\\". Weird Tales, DNA Publications, Fall 1998 (p. 9). References Sources * * Lovecraft, Howard P.

His first elected position was as an alderman in the old Toronto City Council, in the late 1970s. He became a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1981, and served in premier David Peterson's cabinet as minister without portfolio from 1985 to 1987. Ruprecht represented Toronto's Parkdale and then Davenport constituencies for the Liberal Party of Ontario for 30 years. On July 5, 2011, he announced that he was leaving politics and would not seek re- election in the October 2011 provincial election. Background Ruprecht moved to Canada with his family in 1949 after attending school in Germany. He was educated at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario (receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969), Wichita State University (1971) and Miami University, doing Ph.D. work at the latter institution from 1971 to 1973. He taught in the Political Science department at York University, teaching public administration and municipal governance. He has authored two books: The Graduate School Game (1976) and Toronto's Many Faces (1990) now in its 5th edition. The latter book being an overview of Toronto's multicultural communities. Ruprecht is also a member of the Knights of Malta. He has received a number of honours from Portugal, Poland, Estonia and the Philippines. Toronto alderman Ruprecht made his foray into politics by seeking the Liberal Party of Canada's nomination in the federal Parkdale electoral district, for the October 16, 1978 by-election. He lost the nomination to future Toronto mayor, Art Eggleton. He began his political career at the municipal level, when alderman Tony O'Donohue decided to run for mayor in the 1978 Toronto municipal election. His mayoral campaign meant that he would not seek re-election in his Ward 2 seat, in the Parkdale and Brockton part of Toronto's west-end. Ruprecht decided to run for the vacant alderman position in August. On November 13, 1978, he was elected as one of the Ward's two alderman from a field of ten candidates. By receiving the most votes, he became the senior alderman for Ward 2 on Toronto City Council and Metropolitan Toronto Council. He won re-election as the senior alderman in the November 10, 1980 Toronto municipal election. Provincial politics =Parkdale constituency (1981‚Äì1999)= Ruprecht was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1981 provincial election, representing the Parkdale constituency. He defeated incumbent New Democratic Party MPP, Jan Dukszta, by nearly 1,000 votes. Ruprecht was re-elected by a much greater margin in the 1985 election. The Liberals formed government after the election, and on June 26, 1985 Ruprecht was appointed as a minister without portfolio responsible for Disabled Persons and Multiculturalism. He was re-elected by a landslide the 1987 election, but was subsequently dropped from cabinet. The Liberal government called an early election and were defeated by the New Democratic Party (NDP), who formed the government following the 1990 provincial election. Ruprecht managed to retain Parkdale by 523 votes over NDP candidate Sheena Weir, even though most surrounding constituencies were won by the NDP on September 6, 1990. On June 8, 1995, he was re-elected by a greater margin in the 1995 election, as the NDP lost much of its support throughout the province. The Progressive Conservatives won the provincial election, and Ruprecht remained in opposition serving as critic for Citizenship. During his years on the Opposition bench Ruprecht also served variously as Critic for Tourism, Disabilities and Associate Critic for Labour.Tony Ruprecht Parliamentary History, Ontario Legislative Assembly In 1996, Ruprecht was the only Liberal MPP outside of Ottawa to support Dalton McGuinty's bid for party leader prior to the actual leadership convention. McGuinty was chosen leader after five ballots. =Davenport constituency (1999‚Äì2011)= Due to Premier Mike Harris' Progressive Conservative government changing Ontario's provincial electoral boundaries to match the federal ones for the 1999 Ontario general election, the Legislature was reduced to 103 seats, from 130. This boundary change meant that the previous constituencies were redistributed into several of the new ones and incumbent MPPs would have to decide where they would stand for re-election as their old constituencies no longer existed. Ruprecht initially planned to run in the newly created Parkdale‚ÄîHigh Park constituency in the 1999 provincial election, but stood aside for star candidate Gerard Kennedy. Kennedy was forced to step aside for former leadership rival Joseph Cordiano in the newly created York South‚ÄìWeston constituency, because Liberal party leader McGuinty's policies dealing with redistribution and sitting MPPs was to give the senior MPP first choice, and Cordiano was the more senior of those two. Instead, Ruprecht ran in the neighbouring Davenport constituency. It contained the eastern portion of his old Parkdale constituency. He was not appointed as the Liberal candidate, as he had to defeat human-rights lawyer Rocco Galati, at a nomination meeting on July 21, 1998, before he could run in the election. There was a controversy over the nomination process, and Galati unsuccessfully sued the Liberal party, the constituency association, and Ruprecht. Ruprecht's main opponent in the 1999 campaign was another displaced incumbent MPP, the NDP's deputy leader, Tony Silipo. What the Toronto Star dubbed \\"The battle of the Tonys\\" was expected to be a very close race between Silipo and Ruprecht. Election night, June 3, was anti-climatic, as Ruprecht easily won with a 4,932 vote plurality. The Progressive Conservatives managed to lose all their seats in the old city of Toronto, but nevertheless, won the provincial election, and Ruprecht remained in opposition. Ruprecht was elected for a seventh time in the 2003 election, defeating NDP candidate Jordan Berger by over 8,000 votes on October 2, 2003. The McGuinty-lead Liberals formed government following this election after having been in Opposition for 13 years. Despite being the only MPP outside of Ottawa to support McGuinty's leadership campaign, Ruprecht was not appointed to cabinet, but he was appointed Vice-Chair of the legislature's Standing Committee on Regulations and Private Bills. In April 2006, Ruprecht was criticized for being absent from the Ontario legislature for extended periods of time while vacationing in Cuba. The MPP acknowledged that since the previous fall he had made four trips to Cuba for a cumulative period of seven weeks. He defended these trips saying he was travelling to the island to receive lessons in Spanish and Portuguese in order to better be able to communicate with his constituents. In the 2007 provincial election, Ruprecht's margin was reduced to less than 2,000 votes. On July 5, 2011, he announced that he was not running for re-election and would retire. He made this decision, partially because of the unexpected death of fellow Liberal MPP, Bruce Crozier, stating ‚ÄúI have not groomed a successor (in Davenport) simply because Bruce‚Äôs death shocked me.‚Äù The Liberals lost his seat in the ensuing provincial election on October 6, 2011.

About Canadian Stage Canadian Stage is one of Canada's largest not-for-profit contemporary theatre companies, based in Toronto, Ontario. The company was founded in 1987 with the merger of CentreStage and Toronto Free Theatre and has been a favourite of audiences for years, as well as the topic of much discussion in the theatre community. Currently, the company has an emphasis on multidisciplinary work and work in translation, programming international contemporary theatre and developing and producing new Canadian works. Total attendance for a season is approximately 100,000 people. Canadian Stage has produced more than 300 shows - over half of which have been Canadian plays. Canadian Stage also runs a series of artist development and education initiatives, as well as youth and community outreach programs. The current Artistic Director is Brendan Healy, who replaced outgoing Artistic Director, Matthew Jocelyn, in 2018. The current Executive Director is Monica Esteves. Theatres Canadian Stage presents works at three venues: the 876-seat Bluma Appel Theatre; the Berkeley Street Theatres (244-seat Berkeley Downstairs Theatre and the 167-seat Berkeley Street Upstairs Theatre); and a 1000-seat outdoor amphitheatre in Toronto's High Park where Shakespeare is performed each summer. The Bluma Appel Theatre in the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts (a city of Toronto owned building) is the company's main stage. Located at 27 Front Street East, this theatre has been Canadian Stage's home for over 25 years. In the 2016.17 season, they will present eight productions at this theatre. The St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts was constructed in the late 1960s, as part of the city's Centennial Celebrations. It opened in February 1970, but was then called the Theatre. In 1982, it was renovated by the Thom Partnership. A balcony was added, the lobbies expanded and the giant chandeliers installed before the theatre re- opened the following year as the Bluma Appel Theatre, in recognition of the generous financial contributions of arts activist Bluma Appel. The historic Berkeley Street Theatre complex contains two performance spaces, as well as a large rehearsal space, props and wardrobe facilities, and the company's administrative offices. The Berkeley site was originally built by the Consumer's Gas Corporation in 1887 as part of a gas pumping station complex. The Berkeley Downstairs Theatre was originally a pump room and served in that capacity until 1955, when Consumer's Gas moved their production out of downtown Toronto. A wrecking firm was hired to demolish the buildings in February 1971, but the complex was renovated instead of destroyed thanks to the efforts of Tom Hendry, co-founder of Toronto Free Theatre. The Berkeley Upstairs Theatre was created as part of the general 1976 renovations of the complex. This building is also owned by the City of Toronto. Situated in the middle of Toronto's High Park, the Amphitheatre can seat over 1,000 people. The first production of Shakespeare in High Park was performed in 1983 between two large oak trees with none of the infrastructure that exists today. The City of Toronto terraced the hillside of the Amphitheatre to provide more comfortable seating in 1997, and a permanent stage was installed in 2005. Awards Many of the plays developed by Canadian Stage have been awarded and nominated for Canada's most prestigious literary and performing arts honours, including Governor General's, Chalmers and Dora Mavor Moore Awards. Canadian Stage is a three-time recipient of the Lieutenant Governor's Award for the Arts, in recognition of building private sector and community support. Canadian Stage has been nominated for 296 Dora Mavor Moore Awards, receiving 62, in addition to numerous other Canadian and international awards and nominations. Partnership with York University Since 2010, Canadian Stage and York University's Faculty of Fine Arts have collaborated through an MFA in Theatre ‚Äì Stage Direction. The initiative was launched in 2011 to support the development of directorial talent for the national and international stage. The program develops emerging directors with advanced training in large-scale theatre directing. The first graduates of the program were Ker Wells and Ted Witzel. Students are deeply immersed in the professional world of theatre as they integrate their studio work at York with involvement in artistic projects at Canadian Stage. The program is customized for each student based on their experience, artistic orientation and goals. Key elements of this enriched academic experience include the opportunity to direct a Canadian Stage production and an internship with a major national or international theatre. Artistic and General Director Matthew Jocelyn and Lead Mentor, Peter Hinton serve to guide students in the MFA program, working closely with graduate faculty in York's Department of Theatre. Current Leadership The current Artistic Director of Canadian Stage is Brendan Healy. Healy replaced outgoing Artistic Director, Matthew Jocelyn, in early 2018. Prior to his appointment at Canadian Stage, Healy maintained leadership positions at the Rose Theatre in Brampton, and Buddies in Bad Times Theatre. The current Executive Director of Canadian Stage is Monica Esteves. Esteves joins Canadian Stage after a successful tenure at Crow's Theatre.

Tri-ang Railways was a British manufacturer of toy trains, one of the elements of the Lines Bros Ltd company who traded using the brands Tri-ang, Minic, Pedigree, and Frog. The Tri-ang Railways name was dropped a few years after Lines Bros took over the Hornby name although the majority of the trains were still the original Tri-ang models. History =Tri-ang name= The brothers George and Joseph Lines made wooden toys in the Victorian age, their company being G & J Lines Ltd. Joseph was the active partner while George went into farming. Joseph (or Joe) had four sons. Three of these ‚Äì William, Walter and Arthur Edwin Lines ‚Äì formed Lines Bros Ltd shortly after World War I. Three Lines make a triangle, hence the Tri-ang. Arthur's son, Richard Lines, was largely responsible for the Tri-ang Railways system. =Foundation of Tri-ang Railways= Rovex Plastics Ltd was founded just after World War II in 1946 by Alexander Gregory Vanetzian, who made toys for Marks & Spencer. Venetzian was asked to develop an electric toy train set for Christmas 1950. He delivered the product but, although the company had found larger premises in a former Brewery in Richmond, it was constrained financially. Lines Bros were looking to expand into railways and so they purchased Rovex. Their products would be sold under the Tri-ang Railways name from 1951. To give room for development they moved the company, now Rovex Scale Models Ltd, to a brand new factory built at Margate, in Kent, in 1954. As well as 00/H0 gauge, Tri-ang made TT gauge models from 1957 to at least 1967. The 3mm Society supports those who still model Tri-ang TT. Tri-ang also manufactured a garden railway system called Tri-ang Minic Narrowgauge Railway, thus being known as TMNR. This was a 10.25\\" gauge passenger carrying system using 2 rail electric pick-up with motors running at 40 volts DC. This was produced in the early 1960s and not a commercial success, with less than 90 'sets' being produced. =Expansion and name changes= The success of Tri-ang meant that British competitors Trix and Hornby Dublo were affected. In 1964, Hornby Dublo, a division of Meccano Ltd, had stopped production and Meccano Ltd invited Lines Bros. Ltd to buy them out. Tri-ang purchased the company including a large amount of stock. The combined toy railways was marketed as Tri-ang Hornby although the vast majority of the models was all Tri-ang. The Lines Bros empire itself collapsed in 1971 and was broken up. The model railways, then marketed as Tri-ang Hornby, were sold to the Dunbee-Combex-Marx group, but the rights to the Tri-ang brand were sold elsewhere; accordingly, the Hornby name being established and recognised, from 1 January 1972 the model railways were rebranded Hornby Railways. =Australian and New Zealand models= A number of Tri-ang models specific to Australia were produced by Moldex in Melbourne during the 1960s, including: * NSW 1955-type suburban electric motor car and driving trailer car. * Victorian B class double-ended diesel locomotive in 'Transaustralia' livery. * A blue version of NSW 1955-type suburban cars pretending to be a Victorian EMU was planned but never produced Other models were manufactured in Auckland, New Zealand, and were mainly the same as those made in England, although there were interesting variations. The Australian and New Zealand models were produced in 00 gauge only. = Canadian Train Sets and Models = Lines Bros. (Canada) Ltd. was originally incorporated on the 24th March 1947. The trademark used in Canada was that of the thistle which had first been registered by Joseph Lines, the co-founder of G. & J. Lines Ltd., in 1910. The main factory and warehouse facility was located at 4000 St. Patrick Street, Montreal, Quebec. The Canadian company struggled to make acceptable profits and it was thought that profits could be increased with a wider range of toys to market. The Tri-ang Railways Transcontinental range of models was devised specifically with this in mind and by Christmas 1954 the first sets began to appear in the shops. However, the models were produced too quickly, without sufficient attention to detail and lacked realism. Without proper consideration to what the Canadian market demanded, the models were not popular although they sold well enough in the UK. Historically, standard train sets were imported into Canada from the UK; initially only the Transcontinental range of models. However, between 1957 and 1974, a number of sets were produced exclusively for the general Canadian market as well as some special sets commissioned by department store chains and / or mail order companies; including Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears, Eaton‚Äôs, Woodward‚Äôs and the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company. No models were made in Canada but the Canadian company assembled a wide range of sets from both boxed and unboxed models sent out to them from the Margate factory. From 1965 a new full-colour Canadian catalogue was produced, where previously the UK catalogue had been used and supplemented (up until 1962) by an illustrated price list. Initially, a number of Canadian National Railway (CNR) models were introduced specifically for the Canadian market. Later, in 1967 models representing the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) began to appear. Of note were the representations of the transcontinental passenger trains which have become firm favourites with collectors of Tri-ang Railways. =South African models= A limited number of models were manufactured in Durban, South Africa. These are very rare.

The blue are submarine; the red are terrestrial. The Southern Cross Cable, operated by Bermuda company Southern Cross Cables Limited, is a trans-Pacific network of telecommunications cables commissioned in 2000. The network has 28,900 km of submarine and 1,600 km of terrestrial fiber optic cables, all which operate in a triple-ring configuration. Initially, each cable had a bandwidth capacity of 120 gigabit/s. In April of 2008 this capacity was doubled, and was once again upgraded to 860 gigabit/s at the end of 2008. Southern Cross upgraded the existing system to 1.2 Tbit/s in May 2010.Broadband in for another price fall and capacity boost After successful trials of 40G technology the first 400G of a planned 800G upgrade has been completed in February 2012, and the remaining 400G was completed in December 2012.Southern Cross committed to Ultra Fast Broadband and National Broadband Network An additional 400G was deployed utilizing 100G coherent wavelength technology in July 2013, taking total system capacity to 2.6Tbit/s, with an additional 500Gbit/s to be deployed per segment by Q2 2014, increasing total system capacity to 3.6Tbit/s. About every two or three years, the Southern Cross Company makes an effort to upgrade the cables in some way or another. In June 2014 a further 900Gbps was added. The system currently runs at circa 10Tbs employing a mix of 100Gbs, 200Gbs and 250Gbs wavelengths. Southern Cross offers capacity services from 100M/STM-1 to 100Gbit/s OTU-4, including 1G, 10G and 40G Ethernet Private Line services.

In the cross section diagram shown: # Insulating high density polyethylene (17 mm) # Copper tubing (8.3 mm) # Steel wires # Optical fibers in water resistant jelly (2.3 mm) Spying and interception In 2013 the New Zealand Herald reported that the owners of the Southern Cross cable had asked the United States National Security Agency to pay them for mass surveillance of New Zealand internet activity through the cable. In May 2014, John Minto, vice-president of the New Zealand Mana Party, alleged that the NSA was carrying out mass surveillance on all meta-data and content that went out of New Zealand through the cable. In August 2014, Russel Norman, New Zealand Green Party co-leader, stated that an interception point was being established on the Southern Cross Cable. Norman said that as the cable is the only point of telecommunications access from New Zealand, this would allow the Government to spy on all phone calls and internet traffic from New Zealand. Norman's claims followed the revelation that an engineer from the NSA had visited New Zealand earlier in the year to discuss how to intercept traffic on the Southern Cross cable. The office of John Key, New Zealand Prime Minister, denied the claims but admitted that they were negotiating a \\"cable access programme\\" with the NSA but refused to clarify what that was or why the NSA was involved.  Damage incidents  There have been few incidents damaging sections of the Southern Cross Cable, despite it traversing the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire and its long length. In late 2007, Southern Cross Cable's operations vice president, Dean Veverka, confirmed that hurricane strength storms and flooding had wiped out the carrier's Oregon cable route and halved its bandwidth capability between Australia/New Zealand/Fiji and United States for a short period of time, albeit customer services were restored via the systems alternate path. A Southern Cross customer (iiNet) said that emergency works have been organised to perform a more permanent fix for the damage to the cable. These works were performed on 3 February 2008 at 12 midnight AEST.iiNet status page: information regarding Southern Cross cable repairs In March 2008, the then head of Telecom Wholesale, Matt Crockett, mentioned to the National Business Review that there had been a recent undersea earthquake that impacted a shunt on the Southern Cross Cable. However, due to the Cable's redundancy and spare capacity, users experienced no change in access or speed. Construction and ownership Construction of the cable began in July 1999, laid by the ship CS Vercors, and the system was in use by customers by November 2000. Additional works and upgrades have since taken place to increase the network's capacity to 480 Gbit/s. In August 2007, SC Cables contracted with Alcatel-Lucent to upgrade the cable to 660 Gbit/s by the end of the first quarter 2008 and to 860 Gbit/s by the end of 2008, with future upgrade also by Alcatel-Lucent to 1.2 Tbit/s in May 2010.Contract awarded to upgrade Southern Cross cable network: New technology facilitated further upgrades up to 2.4 Tbit/s., Computerworld, accessed 24 August 2007. The cable has since been upgraded to over 10Tbs of capacity with a further >10Tbs of capability available on the existing system. The Southern Cross NEXT system will add a further 72Tbs of capability to the network by the end of 2021. The cable was a private investment and there was in estimated $1.5 billion spent on the initial system development.The company is owned by Spark New Zealand, SingTel/Optus, Telstra (as of December 2019) and Verizon Business. The cables are the result of an agreement between companies Spark Trading, Optus, MFS Globenet, and Southern Cross. The agreement was reached between the companies in 1997 as a response to unexpected growth of the internet that created a need for a submarine cable link connecting the West Coast and Australasia.  Southern Cross NEXT  Southern Cross NEXT is a new route addition to the Southern Cross cable eco- system. This new addition began construction in 2019 and is forecast to be completed by 2022. When finished, the new link will be the largest capacity data link between Sydney, Auckland, and Los Angeles at 16,148 km. The cable is predicted to cost around $300 million and is owned by the Southern Cross group of companies. When finished, Southern Cross NEXT will be able to carry up to 72 terabits per second. The NEXT cable will not be marketed as a stand-alone cable, but rather is designed to be an extension of the original Southern Cross network.

It was founded in the late 18th century by settlers from Connecticut, along the Warriors' Path. The population of the CDP at the 2010 census was 604. Geography Waverly is in northwestern Lackawanna County and occupies the north-central part of Waverly Township. It is bordered to the northwest by the borough of Dalton, to the west by Glenburn Township, and to the northeast by North Abington Township. Pennsylvania Route 632 passes through Waverly, as Carbondale Road to the east of the center of town and as Clinton Street to the west. PA 632 leads east to Interstate 81 and west to the center of Dalton. Pennsylvania Route 407 (North Abington Road) crosses PA 632 in the center of Waverly and leads north to Fleetville and south to Clarks Green. Scranton is south of Waverly. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Waverly CDP has an area of , of which , or 0.08%, are water. The community drains west via Ackerly Creek and other streams to the south branch of Tunkhannock Creek, which flows west to the Susquehanna River.  History  Waverly was originally called \\"Abington Center\\". In 1853, it was established as a borough within Pennsylvania; since there already was a place named \\"Abington\\" located near Philadelphia, the town was renamed \\"Waverly\\" after Sir Walter Scott's Waverley Novels, popular at that time. The borough, located within Lackawanna County, gave up its charter in 1920, because of the high cost to upgrade its main street to a state highway, and became part of Abington Township. On November 2, 2010, township residents voted to change the township's name from \\"Abington\\" to \\"Waverly\\", thus eliminating confusion with Abington Borough. The earliest settlers built cabins in Waverly around 1800. The Philadelphia and Great Bend Turnpike (now Main Street) was chartered in 1819 by the Pennsylvania Legislature along the Warriors' Path. Started in 1820, this turnpike was completed in 1824. During this time, the first three houses which were not cabins were built. In 1828, the Wayside Inn was built, and the first doctor, Andrew Bedford, set up practice and built a house which stands today on Main Street. The first general store was built in 1830, followed by a second inn and tavern in 1832. A building boom ensued during the years 1847 through 1890, during which time Waverly was a profitable small-scale industrial center. 1850 through 1880 was the heyday of Waverly's industrial era. Farmers and dairymen shipped their goods to New York City; iron foundries flourished, and numerous retail establishments, including greengrocers, bakers, a drugstore, dime store, hardware store, lumberyard, and harness shops, thrived. In 1880, the railroad was laid to the west of Waverly, and the prosperity of the town faded. During the mid-19th century, Waverly was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Escaped slaves and freedmen found a sympathetic population in Waverly, and some settled in small houses built by a local farmer and sold to them. The freedmen also built the AME Church, which is in use today as a private residence. It is one of five churches in existence in 1872, three of which still stand and are still active congregations.  Education  Education was always important in Waverly. The first school was started in his log cabin in 1804 by Elder Miller, the first settler in the town. The first dedicated school was built in 1830 on the Philadelphia and Great Bend Turnpike. After it ceased being used as a school, it became a private residence for many years; the Waverly Historic Society is currently planning for its renovation and use as their headquarters. In 1844, a group of investors started the Madison Academy. This was a private school which enjoyed high regard and taught a rigorous curriculum to boys and girls. Students came from all over Pennsylvania to attend the Madison Academy; some of its graduates became judges and attorneys. The tuition ranged from $2.00 to $10.00 per quarter, depending upon the grade, and the boarding house next door charged $1.25 to $1.50 per week. Following the closing of the private school in 1878, the building was used as a public school through 1925, at which time it was razed. The Belin family donated a new school building to the town that originally served all grades. The site of that school is now occupied by a newer building, Waverly Elementary, which serves kindergarten through fourth grade and is part of the Abington Heights School District. The bell from the Madison Academy hangs behind Waverly Elementary, a testament to the long tradition of academic excellence in Waverly. Although the academy was razed, the house across the street from it has a bell in its attic and is sometimes mistaken for the original Madison Academy.  Fire in 1916  In the spring of 1916, a fire devastated the four downtown blocks of Waverly; only 11 businesses remained thereafter. 2 of those buildings have operating businesses in them today: the Waverly Deli and the Waverly General Store. The front two blocks were an eyesore, although summer visitors continued to come from Scranton to Waverly. The Belin family bought the front two blocks and began design and construction of the Waverly Community House. The building was completed in 1920 and expanded to the back two blocks of the original downtown; all streets through those blocks had been removed, and the transformation of downtown to picturesque center was complete. The Community House (commonly referred to as \\"The Comm\\") sits at the center of Waverly. The brick Dutch colonial structure currently houses the Waverly Post Office, a gymnasium with basketball court, a public playground, a preschool program and numerous recreational and educational offerings for families with young children. The Comm also plays host to an annual home and garden show, antique fair, and concerts on the lawn. Margaretta E. Belin funded construction of The Comm as a memorial to her husband, Henry Belin, Jr., after his death in 1917. On June 4, 1920, the building and a portion of the land were deeded to Abington Township for the benefit of the township's residents. Wealthy summer visitors from Scranton migrated to Waverly on a permanent basis, and the town's reputation as a white-collar bedroom community was cemented.

An allegorical tale, it tells the story of one shepherd's long and successful single-handed effort to re-forest a desolate valley in the foothills of the Alps in Provence throughout the first half of the 20th century. It was written in French, but first published in English. Plot The story begins in the year 1913, when a young man who is the narrator was travelling alone on a hiking trip through Provence, France, and into the Alps, enjoying the relatively unspoiled wilderness. He runs out of water in a treeless, desolate valley where only wild lavender grows and there is no trace of civilization except old, empty crumbling buildings. He finds only a dried-up well, but is saved by a middle- aged shepherd who takes him to a spring he knows of. Curious about this man and why he has chosen such a lonely life, the narrator stays with him for a time. The shepherd, Elz√©ard Bouffier, after being widowed, decided to restore the ruined landscape of the isolated and largely abandoned valley by single- handedly cultivating a forest, by planting acorns. He makes holes in the ground with his straight iron staff and drops into them acorns that collected from miles away. He is also growing beech and birch saplings for planting. The narrator leaves the shepherd, returns home, and later fights in the First World War. In 1920, shell-shocked and depressed after the war, the man returns. He is surprised to see young saplings of all forms taking root in the valley, and new streams running through it, where the shepherd has made dams higher up in the mountains. The narrator makes a full recovery in the peace and beauty of the regrowing valley, and continues to visit the region and M. Bouffier every year. He finds on one visit that Bouffier is no longer a shepherd, because of the sheep eating his young trees, and has become a bee keeper instead. The valley receives official protection after the First World War, with the French authorities mistakenly believing that the rapid growth of the new forest is a bizarre natural phenomenon, as they are unaware of Bouffier's selfless deeds. Over four decades, Bouffier continues to plant trees, and the valley is turned into a kind of Garden of Eden. By the end of the story, the valley is vibrant with life and is peacefully settled, with more than 10,000 people living there, not knowing they owe their happiness to Bouffier. The narrator tells one of his friends, a government forester, the truth about the new forest, and the friend also helps to protect it. In 1945, the narrator visits the now very old Bouffier one last time. In 1947, in a hospice in Banon, the man who planted trees peacefully passes away. Background The story itself is so touching that many readers have believed that Elz√©ard Bouffier was a genuine historical figure and that the narrator of the story was a young Jean Giono himself, and that the tale is part autobiographical. Certainly, Giono lived during this time. While he was alive, Giono enjoyed allowing people to believe that the story was real, and considered it as a tribute to his skill. His daughter, Aline Giono, described it as \\"a family story for a long time\\". However, Giono himself explained in a 1957 letter to an official of the city of Digne: > Sorry to disappoint you, but Elz√©ard Bouffier is a fictional person. The > goal was to make trees likeable, or more specifically, make planting trees > likeable. In the letter, he describes how the book was translated in a multitude of languages, distributed freely, and therefore was a success. He adds that, although \\"it does not bring me a cent\\", it is one of the texts of which he is most proud.  Adaptations  *It was adapted as an animated short by Fr√©d√©ric Back and released in 1987. It earned a number of awards including an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. *In 2006, it was adapted for the stage and puppets by Richard Medrington of \\"Puppet State Theatre Company\\" in Edinburgh, Scotland. Spoken-word recordings In 1985 the Paul Winter Consort recorded an album with Robert J. Lurtsema as the narrator. It was made into a book-on- tape in 1990 by Earth Music Productions. In 1992, the American radio show Hearts of Space did a musically-accompanied reading (episode 290, first aired on 15 May) with narration by Robert J. Lurtsema. It has also been recorded for BBC Radio 4 with Bill Paterson narrating.

He made notable contributions to the development of radar and later conducted pioneering work in the field of radio astronomy. With Richard Q. Twiss he developed the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect leading to the creation of intensity interferometers. Hanbury Brown was one of the main designers of the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer and received a number of honours and awards for his work. Early years Hanbury Brown was born in Aruvankadu, the Nilgiris, British India in 1916, the son of an army officer. At age 8 he was sent to England to attend Cottesmore preparatory school in Hove, where he was educated in primarily non-scientific subjects. In 1930, at age 14, Hanbury Brown went on to attend Tonbridge School in Kent for only two years before changing to Brighton Technical College. Though originally planning to become a classics scholar, the change to a technical college came due to influences from those around him. His grandfather, Sir Robert Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., a notable irrigation engineer, was also one of the early pioneers of radio, and following Hanbury Brown's parents' divorce, his legal guardian was a consulting radio engineer. At Brighton Technical College, Hanbury Brown studied for an external Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of London, which he received at the age of 19. At this time he also published his first paper, 'Lamp polar curves on the cathode-ray oscillograph'. Career Though initially planning to study for a Ph.D. at Imperial College, London, Hanbury Brown drew the attention of Henry Tizard. Tizard recruited Hanbury Brown to work for what would become the Telecommunications Research Establishment on Chain Home in 1936, where he worked until 1942; after this he spent 3 years in Washington, D.C. to work with the Combined Research Group at the Naval Research Laboratory developing the Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar which he and John William Sutton Pringle originally invented. By 1947 a consultancy that had been set up by Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the father of radar, offered more interesting prospects for the conversion of wartime developments into peacetime technologies. Hanbury Brown was recruited and worked as a consulting engineer until Watson-Watt moved the firm to Canada. After considering his career possibilities, Hanbury Brown joined Bernard Lovell's radio astronomy group at the University of Manchester in 1949 to work on his PhD. At the University of Manchester, Hanbury Brown worked with Cyril Hazard to modify the 218-ft radio telescope built for the study of cosmic rays into a fully functioning radio telescope. Using it they showed, among other things, that radio waves were being emitted from the Andromeda Galaxy; proving that such emissions were not just from our own galaxy. After completion of the Lovell Telescope Hanbury was among those who used it to discover quasars. Hanbury Brown is primarily known for his work on interferometry, in particular the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect which led to intensity interferometers. Despite opposition from some in the scientific community who argued that his predictions violated the laws of physics, Hanbury Brown and Twiss showed that their theory was correct through a number of observations. In 1962 Hanbury Brown moved to Australia to work at the University of Sydney. There he built his next interferometer ‚Äì the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer ‚Äì in a sheep paddock outside Narrabri in New South Wales, consisting of two 23 ft telescopes. Using it, Hanbury Brown succeeded in measuring the diameters of 32 stars, thus producing the first empirical temperature scale for hot stars. Despite only aiming to stay in Australia for two years, he stayed for a total of 27; going on to receive the Companion of the Order of Australia honour in 1986 for his work. Personal life Hanbury Brown married Heather Hilda Chesterman in 1952 with whom he had one daughter and two sons (twins). He was rumoured to have prompted the term boffin. Brown died in Andover, Hampshire on 16 January 2002. Honours and awards He won the Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize in 1959. In March 1960 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and in 1971 was awarded their Hughes Medal for \\" his efforts in developing the optical stellar intensity interferometer and for his observations of Spica\\". In 1968, he received the Eddington Medal jointly with Twiss (see Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect). He also won the Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal of the Australian Academy of Science in 1972.Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal , Australian Academy of Science, retrieved 6 June 2010. In 1982 he was named President of the International Astronomical Union, a title he retained until the end of his term in 1985. In 1986 he was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia. He was awarded the Albert A. Michelson Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1982, jointly with Richard Q. Twiss and the Matthew Flinders Medal and Lecture the same year. Publications He wrote an autobiographical account of the development of airborne and ground-based radar, and his subsequent work on radio astronomy.

She was the first African-American child to desegregate the all- white William Frantz Elementary School in Louisiana during the New Orleans school desegregation crisis on 14 November 1960. She is the subject of a 1964 painting, The Problem We All Live With by Norman Rockwell. Early life Bridges was the eldest of five children born to Abon and Lucille Bridges. As a child, she spent much time taking care of her younger siblings, though she also enjoyed playing jump rope, softball and climbing trees. When she was four years old, the family relocated from Tylertown, Mississippi, where Bridges was born, to New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1960, when she was six years old, her parents responded to a request from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and volunteered her to participate in the integration of the New Orleans school system, even though her father was hesitant. Background Bridges was born during the middle of the Civil Rights Movement. Brown v. Board of Education was decided three months and twenty-two days before Bridges' birth. The court ruling declared the process of separating schools for black children and white children unconstitutional. Though the Brown v. Board of Education decision was finalized in 1954, southern states were extremely resistant to the decision that they must integrate for the six following years. Many white people did not want schools to be integrated and, though it was a federal ruling, state governments were not doing their part in enforcing the new laws. In 1957, federal troops were ordered to Little Rock, Arkansas to escort the Little Rock Nine students in combating violence that occurred as a result of the decision. Under significant pressure from the federal government, the Orleans Parish School Board administered an entrance exam to students at Bridges' school with the intention of keeping black people out of white schools. Integration Bridges attended a segregated kindergarten in 1959. In early 1960, Bridges was one of six black children in New Orleans to pass the test that determined whether they could go to the all-white William Frantz Elementary School. Two of the six decided to stay at their old school, Bridges went to Frantz by herself, and three children were transferred to McDonogh No. 19 and became known as the McDonogh Three. Bridges and her mother were escorted to school by four federal marshals during the first day that Bridges attended William Frantz Elementary. In the following days of that year, federal marshals continued to escort Bridges, though her mom stayed behind to take care of her younger siblings. William Frantz Elementary School building in 2010 Bridges' father was initially reluctant, but her mother felt strongly that the move was needed not only to give her own daughter a better education, but to \\"take this step forward [...] for all African-American children\\". Her mother finally convinced her father to let her go to the school.Ruby Bridges Hall. \\"The Education of Ruby Nell,\\" Guideposts, March 2000, pp. 3‚Äì4. Judge J.

She never cried. She didn't whimper. She just marched along like a little soldier, and we're all very very proud of her.\\"Susannah Abbey. Freedom Hero: Ruby Bridges U.S. Marshals escorted Bridges to and from school. As soon as Bridges entered the school, white parents pulled their own children out; all the teachers except for one refused to teach while a black child was enrolled. Only one person agreed to teach Bridges and that was Barbara Henry, from Boston, Massachusetts, and for over a year Henry taught her alone, \\"as if she were teaching a whole class.\\" That first day, Bridges and her mother spent the entire day in the principal's office; the chaos of the school prevented their moving to the classroom until the second day. On the second day, however, a white student broke the boycott and entered the school when a 34-year-old Methodist minister, Lloyd Anderson Foreman, walked his five-year-old daughter Pam through the angry mob, saying, \\"I simply want the privilege of taking my child to school ...\\" A few days later, other white parents began bringing their children, and the protests began to subside.Ellen Blue, St. Mark's and the Social Gospel: Methodist Women and Civil Rights in New Orleans, 1895‚Äì1965, pp. 161‚Äì162 (University of Tennessee Press, 2011). Yet, still, Bridges remained the only child in her class, as she would until the following year. Every morning, as Bridges walked to school, one woman would threaten to poison her, while another held up a black baby doll in a coffin;Excerpts from Through My Eyes, at African American World for Kids because of this, the U.S. Marshals dispatched by President Eisenhower, who were overseeing her safety, allowed Bridges to eat only the food that she brought from home. Child psychiatrist Robert Coles volunteered to provide counseling to Bridges during her first year at Frantz. He met with her weekly in the Bridges home, later writing a children's book, The Story of Ruby Bridges, to acquaint other children with Bridges' story. Coles donated the royalties from the sale of that book to the Ruby Bridges Foundation, to provide money for school supplies or other educational needs for impoverished New Orleans school children. The Bridges family suffered for their decision to send her to William Frantz Elementary: her father lost his job as a gas station attendant; the grocery store the family shopped at would no longer let them shop there; her grandparents, who were sharecroppers in Mississippi, were turned off their land; and Abon and Lucille Bridges separated. Bridges has noted that many others in the community, both black and white, showed support in a variety of ways. Some white families continued to send their children to Frantz despite the protests, a neighbor provided her father with a new job, and local people babysat, watched the house as protectors, and walked behind the federal marshals' car on the trips to school.Bridges Hall, Guideposts p. 5. It was not until Bridges was an adult that she learned that the immaculate clothing she wore to school in those first weeks at Frantz was sent to her family by a relative of Dr. Coles. Bridges says her family could never have afforded the dresses, socks, and shoes that are documented in photographs of her escort by U.S. Marshals to and from the school. Adult life Bridges speaking at Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce in February 2015 Bridges, now Ruby Bridges Hall, still lives in New Orleans with her husband, Malcolm Hall, and their four sons. After graduating from a desegregated high school, she worked as a travel agent for 15 years and later became a full-time parent. She is now chair of the Ruby Bridges Foundation, which she formed in 1999 to promote \\"the values of tolerance, respect, and appreciation of all differences\\". Describing the mission of the group, she says, \\"racism is a grown-up disease and we must stop using our children to spread it.\\" Bridges is the subject of the Lori McKenna song \\"Ruby's Shoes\\". Her childhood struggle at William Frantz Elementary School was portrayed in the 1998 made-for-TV movie Ruby Bridges. The young Bridges was portrayed by actress Chaz Monet, and the movie also featured Lela Rochon as Bridges' mother, Lucille \\"Lucy\\" Bridges; Michael Beach as Bridges' father, Abon Bridges; Penelope Ann Miller as Bridges' teacher, Mrs. Henry; and Kevin Pollak as Dr. Robert Coles. Like hundreds of thousands of others in the greater New Orleans area, Bridges lost her home (in Eastern New Orleans) to catastrophic flooding from the failure of the levee system during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Hurricane Katrina also greatly damaged William Frantz Elementary School, and Bridges played a significant role in fighting for the school to remain open. In November 2007, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis unveiled a new permanent exhibit documenting her life, along with the lives of Anne Frank and Ryan White. The exhibit, called \\"The Power of Children: Making a Difference\\", cost $6 million to install and includes an authentic re-creation of Bridges' first grade classroom. In 2010, Bridges had a 50th-year reunion at William Frantz Elementary with Pam Foreman Testroet, who had been, at the age of five, the first white child to break the boycott that ensued from Bridges' attendance at that school. On July 15, 2011, Bridges met with President Barack Obama at the White House, and while viewing the Norman Rockwell painting of her on display he told her, \\"I think it's fair to say that if it hadn't been for you guys, I might not be here and we wouldn't be looking at this together\\". The Rockwell painting was displayed in the West Wing of the White House, just outside the Oval Office, from June through October 2011. Awards and honors In September 1995, Bridges and Robert Coles were awarded honorary degrees from Connecticut College and appeared together in public for the first time to accept the awards. Bridges' Through My Eyes won the Carter G. Woodson Book Award in 2000. On January 8, 2001, Bridges was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton. In November 2006, Bridges was honored as a \\"Hero Against Racism\\" at the 12th annual Anti-Defamation League \\"Concert Against Hate\\" with the National Symphony Orchestra, held at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. On May 19, 2012, Bridges received an Honorary Degree from Tulane University at the annual graduation ceremony at the Superdome. Two elementary schools are named after Bridges: one in Alameda, California and another in Woodinville, Washington. A statue of Bridges stands in the courtyard of William Frantz Elementary School.

The lake is used for the production of salt.  Geography  Lake Grassmere, south of Blenheim and south of the mouth of the Awatere River, is a shallow lagoon protected from the open sea by a single barrier beach covered by sand dunes. It is on the north-easterly extension of the Ward depression. Covering an area of , it has no natural inflow and is prone to strong warm winds. Close to the sea, it also has a very high salinity. Because of these geographical characteristics, it is ideal for natural salt extraction. Grassmere has been divided into solar evaporation ponds. Seawater is pumped in, and moved between ponds over several months, increasing in salinity with each successive evaporation period. As salinity increases, crystallised salt forms and is extracted. Grassmere's area varies between ; this maximum is attained only in rare floods. The watershed is small. The climate, with a low average rainfall of and prevailing strong and dry north-westerly winds, provides Lake Grassmere with the suitable conditions required for natural economic salt production.  Early history  The MƒÅori name for the lake is Kapara Te Hau (\\"wind-blown lake\\"). Early whalers on the coast rendered this name ‚ÄúCobblers' Hole‚Äù. According to MƒÅori oral tradition, the lake occupies the site of early cultivations. Kupe, the navigator, is said to have poured salt water on these cultivations, thus creating the lake. In pre-European times it was used as a ready source of food, as it attracts a wide range of waterfowl. In 1832‚Äì33, a year after NgƒÅti Toa under the leadership of Te Rauparaha had defeated NgƒÅi Tahu at Kaiapoi and Banks Peninsula, NgƒÅti Toa visited the lake to take moulting ducks. A NgƒÅi Tahu force, having learned of this impending visit, laid an ambush. Scouts from Te Rauparaha's party found the locality apparently uninhabited and the canoes were driven ashore. On landing, the visitors were taken by surprise and sustained heavy casualties. Te Rauparaha was seized by T≈´hawaiki, who was anxious to take him alive. The captive, however, after feigning resignation, was less tightly held. He then slipped out of his flax garment, swam to a canoe and made his escape.  Salt industry  Until the 1940s Grassmere's bed was a mud bath in winter and a dustbowl in summer, with the occasional natural deposit of salt. The salt industry began in 1943 and now occupies one-third of the suitable lake area of . The 1960 production was 17,000 tons. * The total consumption of industrial and domestic salt in New Zealand in 1960 was about 61,000 tons. * Maximum expansion could produce 50,000 tons, and many economic by-products can be developed; caustic soda and gypsum are already produced in small quantities. * In 2005 Lake Grassmere provided about half of New Zealand's domestic salt requirements. In addition to low rainfall, Grassmere is perfectly suited to solar salt production. * The large area of flat land that makes up the lake bed is near the sea so it can draw in salt water, and away from large rivers. * High evaporation from sun and wind occurs during summer, and the site has ready access to both sea and rail transport. In the mid 1960s harvests were carried out with a new pattern of crystallising ponds which have special provision for draining off rainwater before it has had time to mix with the brine concentrate. The harvest for 1964‚Äì65 reached 30,000 tons, a record at the time. By 1970 the harvest had increased to almost 52,000 tonnes, but this could not match demand, which had grown with industrial development (especially from freezing works and pulp and paper mills). It became evident that Grassmere could not meet New Zealand's salt requirements. Bulk shipments of salt from the Caribbean and Australia were landed at Mt Maunganui, where a vacuum salt plant was built. This produced the high-purity salt needed by producers in the dairy and pharmaceutical industries. A second, smaller vacuum plant was built at Grassmere. Some rolling stock from the railway at Grassmere salt works is preserved at the Ferrymead Two Foot Railway.  Economics  A large range of salts with slightly different chemical compositions, grain sizes and shapes are produced at Lake Grassmere. All table salt produced in New Zealand is solar salt, and both iodised and non-iodised table salt are available. Iodised salt contains added iodine (to prevent goitre) and silicon dioxide (to make the salt run). Specialty salts, including flaky salt, are also produced at Lake Grassmere. Animal health products such as salt licks for farm animals are produced at Grassmere and Mt Maunganui. At the end of summer Grassmere's gleaming white salt piles are easily seen from State Highway 1. This seasonal landmark forms a vivid contrast to the burnt brown of the Marlborough hills. Seismic activity A fault running underneath Lake Grassmere triggered a magnitude 6.6 earthquake on Friday, August 16, 2013 at 2:31:05 pm.http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/home/M6.6+Lake+Grassmere+earthquake M6.6 Lake Grassmere earthquake The quake was deep and was strike-slip fault similar to the 2013 Seddon earthquake on July 21, thus considered a doublet earthquake.

They typically arise either from modification of an existing peptide, or by designing similar systems that mimic peptides, such as peptoids and Œ≤-peptides. Irrespective of the approach, the altered chemical structure is designed to advantageously adjust the molecular properties such as stability or biological activity. This can have a role in the development of drug-like compounds from existing peptides. These modifications involve changes to the peptide that will not occur naturally (such as altered backbones and the incorporation of nonnatural amino acids). Based on their similarity with the precursor peptide, peptidomimetics can be grouped into four classes (A ‚Äì D) where A features the most and D the least similarities. Classes A and B involve peptide-like scaffolds, while classes C and D include small molecules (Figure 1). alt=Four peptidomimetics classified (A ‚Äì D), based on their similarity with the precursor peptide.  Peptides  = Foldamers =  D-peptides  A D-peptide is a small sequence of D-amino acids. Since ribosomes are specific to L-amino acids, D-peptides rarely occur naturally in organisms and are not easily digested or degraded. D-peptide peptidomimetics are D-peptides designed to mimic natural L-peptides that commonly have therapeutic properties. = Properties of D-peptides = thumbnailright300pxFigure 2. D-peptides assume the mirror image conformation of their L-peptide analogues. Many D-proteins and other D-peptides when placed in a nonchiral solvent like water, assume the mirror image conformation of their L-peptide counterpart. Pictured is an L-peptide (1) fragment with the sequence Asp-Val-Ser and the D-peptide Asp-Val-Ser (2) shown from C-terminus to N-terminus. alt=L-Peptide Asp-Val-Ser and its mirror image. When placed in a nonchiral solvent like water, D-peptides, as well as the larger polypeptide D-proteins, have similar but mirrored properties to the L-peptides and L-proteins with identical sequences. If an L-protein does not require a Chaperone or a structural cofactor to fold, its D-enantiomer protein should have a mirror image conformation with respect to the L-protein (Figure 2). A D-enzyme should act on substrates of reverse chirality compared to the L-enzyme with the same sequence. Similarly, if an L-peptide binds to an L-protein, their D-peptide and D-protein counterparts should bind together in a mirrored way. D-peptides also have properties that make them attractive as drugs. D-peptides are less susceptible to be degraded in the stomach or inside cells by proteolysis. D-peptide drugs can, therefore, be taken orally and are effective for a longer period of time. D-peptides are easy to synthesize when compared to many other drugs. In some cases, D-peptides can have a low immunogenic response. = Methods to designing D-peptides =  Ret design  An L-peptide has three analogue sequences (Figure 3) built from L and D amino acids: the D-enantiomer or inverso-peptide with the same sequence, but composed of D-amino acids and a mirror conformation; the retro-peptide, consisting of the same sequence of L amino acids but in reverse order; and the retro-inverso or D-retro-enantiomer peptide, consisting of D-amino acids in the reversed sequence. While the L-peptide and its D-enantiomer are mirror structures of each other, the L-retro-peptide is the mirror image of the D-retro-inverso-peptide. On the other hand, the L-peptide and the D-retro- inverso-peptide share a similar arrangement of side-chains, although their carboxyl and amino groups point in opposing directions. For small peptides that do not depend on a secondary structure for binding, an L-peptide and its D-retro-inverso-peptide is likely to have a similar binding affinity with a target L-protein. thumbnailright300pxFigure 3. An L-peptide and its analogues. An L-peptide (1) sequence has three analogues: the D-enantiomer (3) with the same sequence, the retro L-peptide (4) with the inverted sequence, and the retro-inverso D-peptide(2), with all D-amino acids and the inverted sequence. In this image (1) and (3) are shown from C-terminus on the left to N-terminus on the right, while (2) and (4) are shown from N-terminus to C-terminus. Note that (1) and (2) have similar side chain positions; one is the retro-inverso sequence of the other. The same applies to (3) and (4). alt=A fragment sequence and its analogues.  Mirror-image phage display  Phage display is a technique to screen large libraries of peptides for binding to a target protein. In phage display, the DNA sequence that codes the potential drug-peptide is fused to the gene of the protein coat of bacteriophages and introduced into a vector. Diversity can be introduced to the peptide by mutagenesis. The protein coats peptides are then expressed and purified, and applied to a surface of immobilized protein targets. The surface is then washed away to remove non-binding peptides, while the remaining binding peptides are eluted. Mirror-image phage display is a similar method that can be used to screen large libraries of D-peptides that bind to target L-proteins. More precisely, since D-peptides can not be expressed in bacteriophages, mirror-image phage display screens L-peptides that bind to immobilized D-proteins that are previously chemically synthesized. Because of the mirror properties of D-peptides, the D-enantiomer of an L-peptide that binds to a D-protein will bind to the L-protein. Mirror-image phage display, however, has two disadvantages when compared to phage display. Target D-proteins must be chemically synthesized, which is normally an expensive and time-consuming process. Also, the target protein must not require a cofactor or a chaperone to fold, otherwise the chemically synthesized D-protein will not fold to the target, mirror structure. thumbnailcenter500x200pxFigure 4. Mirror image phage display. (A) A target L-amino acid protein (L-protein) for which an L-peptide inhibitor might be available is selected. The D-enantiomer protein (D-protein) is chemically synthesized from the same sequence using D-amino acids. If the target L-protein does not require a chaperone or co- factor to fold, the D-protein will mirror the conformation and properties of the L-protein, but the L-peptide inhibitor will most likely have little binding affinity towards it. (B) The synthesized D-proteins are fixed to a surface and exposed to phage displaying many different L-peptides. (C) L-peptides that do not bind well to the surface are washed away. The remaining L-peptides are sequenced. (D) The D-enantiomer peptides (D-peptides) of the binding L-peptides are synthesized using the same sequence and tested against the L-proteins. The D-peptide will bind the L-protein but most likely not bind the D-protein mirror.  Structural similarity  Peptide with secondary structure cannot be mimicked by its retro-inverse, as linking in the reverse order breaks many backbone interactions essential for the secondary structure. An approach to mimicking these peptides is by searching for similar (sidechain) structures in a mirrored copy of the Protein Data Bank for the structured elements, and then linking the sections by retro-inversed versions of the loops found in the original protein.  Small molecules  Examples Peptidomimetic approaches have been utilized to design small molecules that selectively kill cancer cells, an approach known as targeted chemotherapy, by inducing programmed cell death by a process called apoptosis. The following two examples mimic proteins involved in key Protein‚Äìprotein interactions that reactivate the apoptotic pathway in cancer but do so by distinct mechanisms. In 2004, Walensky and co-workers reported a stabilized alpha helical peptide that mimics pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, such as BID and BAD. This molecule was designed to stabilize the native helical structure by forming a macrocycle between side chains that are not involved in binding. This process, referred to as peptide stapling, uses non-natural amino acids to facilitate macrocyclization by ring-closing olefin metathesis. In this case, a stapled BH3 helix was identified which specifically activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by antagonizing the sequestration of BH3-only proteins by anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl-2, see also intrinsic and extrinsic inducers of the apoptosis). This molecule suppressed growth of human leukemia in a mouse xenograft model. Also in 2004, Harran and co-workers reported a dimeric small molecule that mimics the proapoptotic protein Smac (see mitochondrial regulation in apoptosis). This molecule mimics the N-terminal linear motif Ala-Val-Pro-Ile. Uniquely, the dimeric structure of this peptidomimetic led to a marked increase in activity over an analogous monomer. This binding cooperativity results from the molecule's ability to also mimic the homodimeric structure of Smac, which is functionally important for reactivating caspases. Smac mimetics of this type can sensitize an array of non-small-cell lung cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutics (e.g. Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine) both in vitro and in mouse xenograft models. Heterocycles are often used to mimic the amide bond of peptides. Thiazoles, for example, are found in naturally occurring peptides and used by researchers to mimic the amide bond of peptide.

He is the Washington, D.C. bureau chief for Mother Jones and perhaps best known as a cable television commentator. He had previously been the Washington editor for The Nation and appeared regularly on FOX News, MSNBC, National Public Radio, and BloggingHeads.tv opposite various other media personalities. Corn appeared on FOX News more than sixty times, according to a tally by Politifact.com, before becoming a frequent commentator on MSNBC.Jon Greenberg. \\"Mother Jones reporter at center of Bill O'Reilly story: O'Reilly 'often' praised me\\". Politifact, Feb. 26, 2015. As a result of his prominence from his cable television appearances, he has garnered as much as $12,000 for appearances and speeches, for addressing such topics as \\"What‚Äôs Right with the Left & What‚Äôs Wrong with the Right?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the State of the American News Media?\\" He is also a regular attendee of the White House Correspondents Dinner and he is a longstanding member of the Gridiron Club.Ken Silverstein. \\"David Corn: 47 Percent √∑ Liberal Bullshit = Boring Journalism\\". The New York Observer, Sept. 2, 2015. In February 2013, he was named winner of the 2012 George Polk Award in journalism in the category of political reporting for his posting of a video and his reporting of the \\"47 percent story,\\" Republican nominee Mitt Romney's videoed meeting with donors during the 2012 presidential campaign.Monica Bauerlein and Clara Jeffery, \\"Mother Jones' David Corn Wins George Polk Award,\\" Mother Jones, February 17, 2013. Corn has also been a literary critic himself. On one occasion, he criticized his own organization when Nation Books published the translation of a controversial French book on Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. Forbidden Truth: US-Taliban Secret Oil Diplomacy and the Failed Hunt for Bin Laden, by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasqui√©, suggests that the attacks resulted from a breakdown in talks between the Taliban and the United States to run an oil pipeline through Afghanistan. Corn argued that publishing \\"contrived conspiracy theories\\" undermined his ability to expose actual governmental misbehavior. Others involved in the controversy argued that Corn was interfering with the First Amendment rights of both the author and publisher, and that Corn had the right to criticize it, but should not have tried to suppress its publication.Rutten, Tim. \\"French 9/11 Theory Finds Voice in the U.S.\\" Los Angeles Times, July 3, 2002, p. E1. Early life and education Corn was raised in a Jewish familyInterfaith Family: \\"Politically Correct\\" by Nate Bloom. November 13, 2012 in White Plains, New York.Brown Alumni Magazine: \\"You Don't Have to Trust Me\\" by Stephanie Grace May/June 2013 He graduated from White Plains High School in 1977. He attended Brown University, where he majored in history and worked for The Brown Daily Herald. After his junior year, he interned at The Nation where he accepted a job as editorial assistant instead of returning to finish his degree. He earned his remaining credits at Columbia University and received a B.A. from Brown in 1982. He joined Mother Jones in 2007. Career =Books= Corn's first book was Blond Ghost: Ted Shackley and the CIA's Crusades, a 1994 biography of longtime Central Intelligence Agency official Ted Shackley, which received mixed reviews. The book used Shackley's climb through the CIA bureaucracy to illustrate how the Agency worked and to follow some of its Cold War-era covert operations. In The Washington Post, Roger Warner called it \\"an impressive feat of research\\"; but, in The New York Times, Joseph Finder asserted that Corn distorted history seriously to blame Shackley for a series of institutional CIA failings and pointed out a series of serious errors in the book. Among them, Finder said, was that Corn \\"recycled a long- discredited canard, much beloved by conspiracy theorists, that on the day of President John F. Kennedy's assassination, the agency's chief of covert operations, Desmond FitzGerald, met in Paris with one of the C.I.A.'s Cuban agents and gave him a 'ball-point pen' that could be used to inject Castro with a deadly toxin called Black Leaf 40. FitzGerald was actually the host of a lunch in Washington at the time, at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown.\\"Warner, Roger. \\"The Spy as Bureaucrat.\\" Washington Post, October 23, 1994, p. WBK1.Finder, Joseph. \\"The Spy in the Gray Flannel Suit.\\" New York Times, October 23, 1994, p. A22. Corn contributed a short story to Unusual Suspects (1996), a paperback collection of original crime stories.Weeks, Linton. \\"They Wrote the Book on Fund-Raising.\\" Washington Post, May 15, 1996, p. B1. His first and only novel, Deep Background (1999), is a conspiracy thriller about the assassination of a U.S. president at a White House press conference and the ensuing investigation. Reviews praised Corn's mastery of the political atmosphere and characters, although they split on whether this was a virtue or, coming towards the conclusion of Bill Clinton's term in office, already all-too-familiar territory. Reviewing the book in the New York Times, James Polk opined that although the book's included dramatic scenes such as a \\"seedy nightspot catering to homosexual marines, an interagency hit squad, a high-class look, but don't touch escort service\\", the novel could not deliver \\"enough shocks left to sustain the genre.\\".Polk, James. \\"The West Wing.\\" New York Times Book Review, October 10, 1999, p. 25. With the arrival of George W. Bush, Corn became a harsh critic of the President. His next book, 2003's The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception, alleged that Bush had systematically \\"mugged the truth\\" as a political strategy, and he found fault with the media for failing to report this effectively. The book also broke with journalistic practice for its explicit charge of lying, a word usually avoided as editorializing.Geoffrey Hodgson. \\"Trust Buster.\\" Washington Post, December 18, 2003, p. C3.Hertsgaard, Mark. \\"Chapter and verse on the need for regime change.\\" Los Angeles Times, March 14, 2004, p. R3. In particular, Corn criticized many of the arguments offered to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq; and he challenged New York Times columnist William Safire for claiming links between Saddam Hussein and Al- Qaeda.Okrent, Daniel. \\"The Privileges of Opinion, the Obligations of Fact.\\" New York Times, March 28, 2004, p. 4.2. In Hubris, written with Michael Isikoff of Newsweek, Corn analyzed the Bush administration's drive toward the invasion. Corn announced on The Rachel Maddow Show on September 12, 2017 that he and Michael Isikoff were working on a new book about the Donald Trump campaign and administration's ties with Russia and the Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential campaign, as well as a history of Russian tactics. Their book was released on March 13, 2018 and entitled Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump =The Plame affair= Corn was personally involved in the early coverage of the controversy over leaks to the media of the name of CIA officer Valerie Plame. After Robert Novak revealed Plame's identity in his July 14, 2003, column, Corn was among the first to report, several days later, that Plame had been working covertly;Corn, David. \\"Nigergate Thuggery.\\" The Nation, August 4, 2003.Toensing, Victoria. \\"What a Load of Armitage!\\" Wall Street Journal, September 15, 2006, p. A12. He also raised the possibility that the leak of her identity violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act (IIPA); however, prosecutors found no evidence that those government officials who leaked her name knew she was a covert agent, and no official was ultimately charged with violating the IIPA.Howard Kurtz. \\"A Hot-Water Leak.\\" Washington Post, October 1, 2003, p. C1. Novak, for his part, disputed that Plame had been a covert operative at the time her identity was revealed. He also objected to the negative portrayal of himself in Hubris, the book in part about the matter by Corn and Isikoff. Novak said of Corn, \\"Nobody was more responsible for bloating this episode.\\" Novak felt that Corn was too close with former ambassador Joseph Wilson, Plame's husband and a key figure in criticism of the administration's arguments for invasion.Novak, Robert, \\"Who Said What When: The rise and fall of the Valerie Plame 'scandal.'\\" The Weekly Standard, October 16, 2006. However, in early 2007, an unclassified summary of Valerie Plame's employment history at the CIA was disclosed for the first time in a court filing which confirmed that Plame was indeed a covert operative at the time Novak made her name public. =Mitt Romney \\"47 Percent\\" video and George Polk Award= In announcing Corn's being awarded the George Polk Award for 2012, the sponsors wrote: > David Corn of Mother Jones will receive the George Polk Award for Political > Reporting ...

It protrudes five kilometres into the Pacific Ocean. The town of Kaik≈çura is located on the north shore of the peninsula. The peninsula has been settled by Maori for approximately 1000 years, and by Europeans since the 1800s, when whaling operations began off the Kaik≈çura Coast. Since the end of whaling in 1922 whales have been allowed to thrive and the region is now a popular whale watching destination. The Kaik≈çura Peninsula is made up of limestone and mudstone which have been deposited, uplifted and deformed throughout the Quaternary. The peninsula is situated in a tectonically active region bounded by the Marlborough Fault System. The Kaik≈çura Canyon is a submarine canyon situated 500 metres off the coast to the south-east of the peninsula. It is 60 km long, up to 1200 m deep, and is generally U-shaped. It is an active canyon that merges into a deep-ocean channel system that meanders for hundreds of kilometres across the deep ocean floor. History The peninsula has been inhabited by MƒÅori for the best part of 1000 years. They used it as a base for hunting moa, and also harvested the plentiful crayfish which are found along the shore. In legend, it was from this peninsula that legendary hero MƒÅui is reputed to have dredged up the giant fish that became the North Island. Strategic positions on the high terraces were fortified by the MƒÅori and those fortifications can still be seen in lidar imagery of the peninsula During the 19th century, European whaling stations were established in the area. In more recent times, the whales that visit the coast off the peninsula have been allowed to thrive, and whale-watching makes the area a popular ecotourism destination. Whales frequent these coastal waters because squid and other deep-sea creatures are brought from the deep Hikurangi Trench to the surface by the combination currents and steeply sloping seafloor.  Geology and geomorphology  Wave cut platform formation The Kaik≈çura Peninsula is located on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Geologically the peninsula consists of an asymmetrical anticline bounded on either side by two synclines, the axis of which strikes northeast‚Äìsouthwest. The peninsula is made up of two different types of sedimentary rocks, the Amuri Limestone of Palaeocene age and Oligocene aged mudstone. Intense folding and minor faulting have occurred, particularly in the limestone area. Shore platforms are developed in both lithological units, those in limestone displaying wider variability in morphology. The multi-level terraces were once wave-cut platforms, created at sea level and uplifted out of the sea by tectonic processes, at which point the next step would be cut. In the landscape they appear as a flight of terraces with the oldest appearing at the top and the youngest at the shoreline where the Kaikoura township is situated. The shoreline of the Kaik≈çura Peninsula is exposed to an extremely long fetch from the Pacific Ocean, and it is also characterised as a high-energy oceanic swell environment, with high-energy storms interrupting long periods of relative calm. High-energy storms due to the passage of cyclonic depressions over New Zealand can occur at any time of the year. The Kaikoura Coast is mesotidal with a mean range of 1.36 m and a maximum of 2.57 m. The region has a temperate climate with moderate rainfall, averaging 865 mm per year and mean monthly temperatures range from 7.7¬∞ Celsius in July to 16.2¬∞ Celsius in January. The Kaik≈çura Peninsula environment is subject to highly energetic processes in terms of both marine and weathering processes. Shore platforms are exposed to the dominant wave directions and are in the intertidal zone. Consequently, both marine erosive forces and subaerial weathering processes contribute to erosion. Shore platforms range from 40 m to over 200 m wide and are cut in Tertiary mudstones and limestones. Tectonic uplift of the central parts of the peninsula is estimated to be in the order of 100 metres during the Quaternary but the terraces are tilting and so surface uplift is variable. Flights of beaches that fringe the Peninsula record a combination of uplift by earthquakes and sea level fall. The most recent uplift occurred during the Kaik≈çura Earthquake of 14 November 2016 and another probably occurred shortly before the arrival of whalers in the area around 1840 . The shore platforms are polycyclic and contain inherent morphological features but are being actively rejuvenated by the removal of cover deposits. Four main phases of tectonic activity are identified for the last 5‚Äì6000 years. These involve changing tectonic-eustatic levels, platform processes and erosional episodes in the hinterland. Consequently, the platforms are rapidly evolving features which reflect both contemporary processes and recent tectonic history. Kaik≈çura Canyon The Kaik≈çura Canyon is a submarine canyon located southwest of the Kaik≈çura Peninsula off the northeastern coast of the South Island. It is 60 km long, up to 1200 m deep, and is generally U-shaped. It is an active canyon that merges into a deep ocean channel system that meanders for hundreds of kilometres across the deep ocean floor. It is the main sediment source of the 1500 km long Hikurangi Channel, which supplies turbidites to the Hikurangi Trough, as well as to low parts of the oceanic Hikurangi Plateau, and to the edge of the southwest Pacific Basin. It is deeply incised into the narrow, tectonically active, continental margin. It is thought to be the sink for the coastal sediment transport system that carries large amounts of erosional debris northwards up the coast from the rivers draining the tectonically active mountains of the South Island. =Landslide tsunami hazard= Generalised simulation of sediment transport processes and consequent tsunami events There is a known risk of an earthquake-triggered tsunami resulting from the displacement of sediment accumulating at the mouth of the canyon. Sediment consisting of fine sand and silt is being deposited at the head of the Kaik≈çura Canyon with an estimated total volume of 0.24 cubic kilometres accumulated. A near-field tsunami caused by the displacement of this sediment poses a significant threat to the surrounding area, especially coastal infrastructure such as roads and houses. Historical accounts of canyon-related tsunami in this region are uncertain. Geological evidence is also limited, and no palaeotsunami specific studies have been carried out to date. However, in archaeological literature, there are some possible indications of past marine inundation events. Marine sediments can be seen to overlie an historical Maori occupation site on Seddon's Ridge, near South Bay. These deposits indicate that marine inundation occurred sometime within the last 150‚Äì200 years. Seddon's Ridge is an uplifted beach ridge and has a long history of Maori settlement. An older village site dating from approximately 650 years before present, situated approximately 350 metres from the shoreline, contains reworked oven stones which are overlain by marine overwash deposits. Without accompanying reliable geological data, this kind of archaeological evidence is only circumstantial. However it does indicate that the ocean has inundated past coastal settlements in the region as a result of a severe storm surge or tsunami. Marlborough Fault System Rapidly accumulating sandy sediment on a steep slope, in an active tectonic region, is likely to be susceptible to failure during moderately large earthquakes. Strong ground shaking associated with rupture on nearby faults can be expected to reduce the shear strength of the sandy sediment deposit at the Canyon Head and may trigger mass failures. It is estimated that an earthquake magnitude 8 on the Richter magnitude scale or shaking equivalent to V (Moderate) on the Mercalli intensity scale would be enough to trigger such an event. The Kaikoura Region is adjacent to the Marlborough fault zone. There are a number of faults in this area predicted to have the capacity to produce such an event. The most likely are the Hope Fault, previously New Zealand's most active fault, and the larger Alpine Fault. The lesser-known Hundalee Fault also terminates near the Kaikoura coast, and although it is not as large as other faults in the area, it still has the potential to trigger a submarine landslide event. The return period for major magnitude 8 or intensity V earthquakes at Kaikoura has been estimated to be in the order of 150 years based on what is known about the return time of earthquake events for regional faults in the Kaikoura area. There is evidence of past failures in similar deposits in the Kaik≈çura Canyon, in the presence of numerous sand and gravel turbidite deposits in cores taken from the canyon axis. Ground acceleration with a peak of 0.44 g is estimated at the Kaikoura township for a return period of 150 years. There have been no large seismic events centred close to Kaik≈çura since written records of the area began in about 1840 AD, but lichen-dating of rock-falls suggests that there may have been a major earthquake in the vicinity 175 years ago. This correlates with the estimated amount of time it would have taken to accumulate the present sediment deposits seen at the canyon head. Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn that sediment in the canyon head gully failed and flowed down the canyon as a major turbidity current released by this earthquake. A landslide-generated tsunami represents a large potential hazard to the area from South Bay to Oaro. An extreme event has been modelled incorporating failure of the entire landslide mass identified by Lewis & Barnes. These simulations indicate the potential for large tsunami runup heights along this section of coast. The effects could be more severe here if such an event coincided with storm activity or high tides. It is estimated to take approximately a century to accumulate enough sediment in the canyon head to generate a major mass failure. Therefore, there is already enough sediment to pose a significant hazard. Evidence of tensional cracks at the head of the modern deposit indicate that it is likely to fail as a result of shaking associated with a major earthquake. Failure would result in the collapse of an estimated quarter of a cubic kilometre of unconsolidated sediment. The canyon- head gully of the Kaik≈çura Canyon faces northwards, obliquely towards the shore. Consequently, the initial motion of a debris avalanche in the gully, and the resulting tsunami, is towards the shore of South Bay and the southern side of the Kaik≈çura Peninsula.

Once established, they are legally binding on employers and employees that are covered by the Enterprise bargaining agreement. An Enterprise Agreement (EA) consists of a collective industrial agreement between either an employer and a trade union acting on behalf of employees or an employer and employees acting for themselves. On the one hand, collective agreements, at least in principle, benefit employers, as they allow for improved \\"flexibility\\" in such areas as ordinary hours, flat rates of hourly pay, and performance-related conditions. On the other hand, collective agreements benefit workers, as they usually provide higher pay, bonuses, additional leave and enhanced entitlements (such as redundancy pay) than an award does. Industrial Awards and the Fair Work Act Unlike awards, which provide similar standards for all workers in the entire industry covered by a specific award, collective agreements usually apply only to workers for one employer. However, a short-term collaborative agreement (for example, on a building-site) occasionally yields a multi-employer/employee agreement. Parties endorse proposed enterprise agreements between themselves (in the case of employees the matter goes to a vote). The Fair Work Commission then assess them for approval. (Under the Fair Work Act 2009, agreements renamed \\"enterprise agreements\\" and are lodged with the Fair Work Commission to assess entitlements against the modern award and be checked for breaches of the Act.) =History= Enterprise Bargaining Agreements were first introduced in Australia under the Prices and Incomes Accord in 1991 (Mark VII). They later became the centrepiece of the Australian industrial relations system when the Accord was next revised in 1993 (Mark VIII). This ended nearly a century of centralised wage-fixing based industrial relations. =How an enterprise agreement is made= The Fair Work Act 2009 provides a simple, flexible and fair framework that assists employers and employees to bargain in good faith to make an enterprise agreement. Employers, employees and their bargaining representatives are involved in the process of bargaining for a proposed enterprise agreement. An employer must notify their employees of the right to be represented by a bargaining representative during the bargaining of an enterprise agreement (other than a greenfields agreement) as soon as possible, and not later than 14 days after the notification time for the agreement (usually the start of bargaining). The notification should be given to each current employee who will be covered by the enterprise agreement. =Use of enterprise agreements= A standard enterprise agreement would last for three years. EAs had one unique feature in Australia: whilst negotiating a federal enterprise bargaining agreement, a group of employees or a trade union could, without legal penalties, undertake industrial action (including strikes) in pursuit of their claims . =Issues regarding enterprise agreements= A major legal question associated with enterprise agreements stemmed from the High Court of Australia's decision in the case of Electrolux v The Australian Workers' Union. The question revolved around what these industrial instruments could cover. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission determined the matter in 2005 in the three certified agreements case. = The future of EAs in Australian industrial law = In the context of Australian labour law, the industrial reform of 2005‚Äì2006, known as \\"WorkChoices\\" (with its corresponding amendments to the Workplace Relations Act (1996)) changed the name of such agreement documents to \\"Collective Agreement\\". State industrial legislation can also prescribe collective agreements, but the enactment of the WorkChoices reform will make such agreements less likely to occur. Since the Fair Work Act was enacted, parties to Australian federal collective agreements lodge their agreements with Fair Work Australia for approval. Before an enterprise agreement will be approved a member of the tribunal must be satisfied that employees employed under the agreement will be 'Better Off Overall' than if they were employed under the relevant modern award.

The Commission commented specifically on the structure of the CIRM governance board and the need for greater transparency and accountability.Little Hoover Commission (25 June 2009). \\"Stem Cell Research: Strengthening Governance to Further the Voters' Mandate\\" (PDF). Retrieved 1 April 2014. The Commission provided suggestions on how to improve the structure and enhance the functioning of the CIRM board some of which included: decreasing the size of the ICOC from 29 to 15 members with four having no affiliations with CIRM-funded organizations; allowing board members to serve a maximum of four years; and eliminating the overlapping responsibilities of the agency chair and the board president. In addition, the Commission recommended that CIRM also allow outside experts to evaluate grant proposals. CA Senator Dean Florez, Little Hoover Commission member and State Senate Majority leader at the time, was not satisfied with the report, highlighting several concerns in a letter to the Little Hoover Commission, stating: ‚ÄúI am concerned about the Commission's apparent rush to conclude its report. As one member said at the meeting, five minutes and a sandwich is not adequate time for Commission members to absorb the information that was presented. While I appreciate the substantial effort that Commission members and staff put into drafting the report, I am concerned that due to its rush to approve the report, the Commission gave disproportionate weight to CIRM's critics and did not consider a broader range of views on the complex issues that are the subject of the report.‚ÄùFlorez, D.

A 2008 ‚ÄúReview Of Conflict-Of-Interest Policies, Grant Administration, Administrative Expenses, And Expenditures,‚Äù by the State Controller‚Äôs office, which examined 18 straight months of the agency‚Äôs operations, found that ‚ÄúCIRM has extensive conflict-of-interest policies and processes that are modeled after and, in some instances, go beyond National Institute of Health requirements.

California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) Review Report: Review of Conflict-of-Interest Policies, Grant Administration, Administrative Expenses, and Expenditures (pp. 1-26, Rep.). Sacramento, CA: California State Controller. In December 2012, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report, ‚ÄúThe California Institute for Regenerative Medicine: Science, Governance, and the Pursuit of Cures‚Äù, that evaluated CIRM programs and operations since its start in 2004. The IOM committee made recommendations similar to those made in the Little Hoover Commission. In general, the IOM recommended that the ICOC separate their responsibilities as executor and overseer and noted potential conflicts of interest among the CIRM board members.Institute of Medicine (2013). \\"The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine: Science, Governance, and the Pursuit of Cures\\". Archived from the original on 9 April 2014. Retrieved 24 March 2014. Several active CIRM board members also represented organizations that currently received or benefited from CIRM grants. The IOM committee also recommended that CIRM organize a single Scientific Advisory Board with experts in stem cell biology and cell-based therapies. In 2014 the integrity of CIRM's grant review process was challenged, after CIRM awarded a Stanford-led consortium $40 million stem cell genomics award, making it the largest CIRM research grant.Jensen, David. \\"California's $40 Million Stem Cell Genomics Award: irregularities, Complaints and Integrity\\". Retrieved 8 April 2014. In February 2013, CIRM reviewers evaluated applications for genomics awards but, for the first time, declined to send any grant proposals to the board for a final decision. Comments were sent back to the researchers and re-submissions were accepted in Fall 2013. During the Fall 2013 review, CIRM reviewers sent all four genomic award proposals to the CIRM board, recommending that all four projects receive funding despite the projects exceeding the budget of $40 million. The CIRM President, Alan Trounson, became involved in the selection process and the final decision was to fund the Stanford project only, totaling $40 million. The CIRM grant review and scoring process and the role of President Trounson have been questioned, especially by those that did not receive funding like Jeanne Loring from the stem cell program at Scripps Research Institute.Jensen, David (10 February 2014). \\"Amid Allegations of Unfairness, California's Stem Cell Agency Begins Examinations of $40 million Genomics Award Round\\".

In the United States, pattern bargaining was pioneered by unions such as the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters. The first step of the bargaining process is the identification of a target employer that is most likely to agree to a favourable employment contract. For the selected company, this provides an opportunity to influence the contract for the industry, while the downside is the risk of a labour disruption if negotiations stall or fail. Once this contract has been successfully negotiated and ratified by the unionized workers, the union declares it a \\"pattern agreement\\" and presents it to the other employers as a take-it-or-leave-it offer. In Australia, pattern bargaining was specifically outlawed under the now-repealed WorkChoices legislation. The law was repealed by the Labor Party after their victory in the 2007 election, but Labor's Fair Work Act, which came into force on 1 July 2010, still outlaws pattern bargaining.

Sebring (pronounced \\"sea-bring\\") Raceway is one of the oldest continuously operating race tracks in the U.S., its first race being run in 1950. Sebring is one of the classic race tracks in North American sports car racing, and plays host to the 12 Hours of Sebring. The raceway occupies a portion of Sebring Regional Airport, an active airport for private and commercial traffic that was originally built as Hendricks Army Airfield, a World War II training base for the U.S. Army Air Forces. History Sebring Raceway occupies the site of Hendricks Army Airfield, a training base for B-17 pilots in operation from 1941 to 1946. After the war, Russian-American aeronautical engineer Alec Ulmann was seeking sites for converting military aircraft to civilian use when he discovered potential in Hendricks' runways and service roads to stage a sports car endurance race similar to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a race Ulmann was inspired to somewhat re-create in the United States. Sebring's first race was held on New Year's Eve of 1950, attracting thirty race cars from across North America. The Sam Collier 6 Hour Memorial race was won by Frits Koster and Ralph Deshon in a Crosley Hot Shot that had been driven to the track by Victor Sharpe. The first 12 Hours of Sebring was held on March 15, 1952, shortly growing into a major international race. In 1959, the track hosted the U.S.' first Formula One race (the successor to historic European Grand Prix motor racing), held as that year's installment of the historic United States Grand Prix competition. However poor attendance and high costs relocated the next U.S. Grand Prix to Riverside International Raceway in southern California. Press box For much of Sebring's history, the track followed a layout. After a disastrous 1966 12 Hours with five fatalities, the track was widened in parts and also lengthened a total of for 1967 with the removal of the Webster Turn between the hairpin and the top of the track and replacement with the faster Green Park Chicane, further down the track. This was closer to the hairpin and allowed a flat-out run through a very fast corner to the top of the track and the runway. This was done to move the track off the dangerous Warehouse Straight and the warehouses, hangars and airplanes flanking it; a crash during that 1966 12 Hours involving a privately entered Porsche that went into one of the warehouses (this area was off-limits to non-track personnel) and into a crowd, killing four spectators. The circuit was changed and shortened in 1983 to allow simultaneous use of the track and one of the runways, and major changes in 1987 allowed use of another runway. Further changes in 1991 accommodated expansion of the airport's facilities, allowing the entire track to be used without interfering with normal airport operations and bringing it close to its current configuration. The hairpin was removed in 1997 due to a lack of run-off, and replaced with what became known as the \\"safety pin\\". Gendebien Bend was also re-profiled to slow the cars' entry to the Ullman straight.12 Hours of Sebring Final Hours of Sebring 2011 The track is currently owned by IMSA Holdings, LLC through its subsidiary Sebring International Raceway, LLC via its purchase of the Panoz MSG in September 2012. It is currently leased by the Sebring International Raceway, LLC, which acquired the facility from Andy Evans in 1997. The track is often recognized for its famous, high-speed \\"Turn 17\\", a long, bumpy, fast right hander that can make or break a car's speed down the front straight. The corner can fit up to 3 cars wide. Skip Barber Racing School held numerous programs at the facility, including a scholarship opportunity for young racers. The World Endurance Championship runs a round called the 1,000 Miles of Sebring, run concurrently with the famed 12 Hours. This race was first run in 2019, with Toyota Gazoo Racing winning overall. Track configuration Sportscars at Sunset Bend at Sebring International Raceway during 2018 12 Hours of Sebring. Track map. Sebring International Raceway consist of three tracks: the Full Circuit, the Short Circuit, and the Club Circuit. The course of the track itself is long. It is a seventeen-turn road course with long straights, several high-speed corners, and very technical slower corners. Many of the turns and points along the track are named for the early teams and drivers. Due to Florida's flat nature there is very little elevation change around the track and little camber on the surface, providing a challenging track for drivers, especially when it rains. The track layout from 1952 to 1966 (1st variation). Length: 5.38 mi (8.356 km) Lap record: Dan Gurney, Ford GT40, 2:54.6, 1966 Sebring is renowned for its rough, bumpy and changing surfaces. The course still runs on old sections of World War II-era landing fields that were constructed of concrete sections with large seams. The transitions between sections are quite rough and often, sparks fly from the undercarriages of the cars as they traverse them. Much of the track has intentionally been left with its original concrete runway surface. The 12 Hours of Sebring is renowned as a race that is even harder on machinery and drivers than Le Mans, and is seen as an ideal preparation run for the famed French race. The track surface has of asphalt and of concrete. Mario Andretti, a 3-time 12 Hours winner, said that one of the hardest parts about the original Sebring track was \\"finding the track to begin with.\\" There had been many accounts of drivers retiring due to accidents at night, quite simply because they got lost on the runway sections and couldn't find the track again. Some drivers got lost even during the day, mostly because the track was poorly marked down with white lines and cones.About Sebring Raceway Events Sebring is most notable for hosting the 12 Hours of Sebring, sanctioned by the FIA and IMSA, as part of many major endurance racing series, including the World Sportscar Championship, Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, ALMS, and now, the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. This race is the second of four races in the Michelin Endurance Cup. The track also hosts the Legends of Motorsport and Historic Sportscar Racing series, and is the winter home of the Skip Barber Racing School. Many IndyCar, sports prototype, and Grand Touring teams use Sebring for winter testing due to the warm climate. Each February, the racetrack hosts the Bike Sebring 12/24 Hours, an ultra-distance cycling race organized by the Highlands Pedalers Bicycle Club and the Rotary Club of Highlands County.Bike Sebring official website IndyCar regularly holds tests at the facility to simulate street circuits on its calendar.

After their divorce, Nelson Rockefeller remained governor and would become the 41st Vice President of the United States under Gerald Ford. Early life Known as Tod to her family, she was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia on June 17, 1907. She was the daughter of Elizabeth Williams (n√©e Roberts) Clark and Percy Hamilton Clark, was an attorney and noted cricketer. Among her siblings was two brothers, John R. Clark and Dr. Thomas W.

It was sponsored by the Brothers of Holy Cross from the University of Notre Dame. History Sacred Heart Military Academy (called SHMA by the students) operated in Watertown, Wisconsin, until the summer of 1968. After graduating its last class, the school was moved to Rolling Prairie, Indiana. The name was changed, in part, because the brothers in Watertown kept receiving applications from the parents of girls. The last class consisted mostly of boys from the Milwaukee and Chicago areas with many from Mexico. Student activities included military drills, a rifle range, a large gym, soccer, track, baseball, and other sports. The school also had a slot car track and recreation room. The students wore military uniforms every day and a special dress uniform on Sunday. Boys held different ranks and received demerits for bad behavior. Demerits had to be worked off with calisthenics and stress positions like bending at the waist with hands clasped behind the head. Offenses like fighting earned the use of \\"the paddle\\". Students were required to learn Drill. Students were not allowed to carry money or to leave the campus. Students were allowed phone calls on a certain night of the week. Students were not allowed to go home for a few days on break, (Weekend Break) should they have too many Demerits. Students were required to stay in their rooms after 9:00 P.M. Students Study halls were held every evening but Sunday for two hours. Daily life was very regimented, classes were held Monday through Friday, as well as Saturday morning, and students had only about two hours to themselves every day. Brother John Driscoll was headmaster for many years and was later replaced by Brother Carroll Posey. On May 26, 1968, SHMA graduated its last class of 35 eighth grade students. About 700 people attended. In the summer of 1968, the school was moved to Indiana. SHMA had only grades 5-8. The Watertown campus is now Maranatha Baptist Bible College.

The final draft of the Declaration was written by Thomas Jefferson and revised by John Dickinson.Boyd, Julian P., ed. The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 1. Princeton University Press, 1950. Includes two drafts by Jefferson, one by Dickinson, and the version adopted by Congress. Content The Declaration describes what colonists viewed as the effort of the British Parliament to extend its jurisdiction into the colonies following the Seven Years' War. Objectionable policies listed in the Declaration include taxation without representation, extended use of vice admiralty courts, the several Coercive Acts, and the Declaratory Act. The Declaration describes how the colonists had, for ten years, repeatedly petitioned for the redress of their grievances, only to have their pleas ignored or rejected. Even though British troops have been sent to enforce these unconstitutional acts, the Declaration insists that the colonists do not yet seek independence from the mother country. They have taken up arms \\"in defence of the Freedom that is our Birthright and which we ever enjoyed until the late Violation of it\\", and will \\"lay them down when Hostilities shall cease on the part of the Aggressors\\". The opening paragraph likens the colonies as being enslaved to the Legislature of Great Britain by violence, against its own constitution, and gives that as the reason for the colonies taking up of arms: Authorship In the 19th century, the authorship of the Declaration was disputed. In a collection of his works first published in 1801, John Dickinson took credit for writing the Declaration. This claim went unchallenged by Thomas Jefferson until many years later, when Jefferson was nearly 80 years old. In his autobiography, Jefferson claimed that he wrote the first draft, but Dickinson objected that it was too radical, and so Congress allowed Dickinson to write a more moderate version, keeping only the last four-and-a-half paragraphs of Jefferson's draft. Jefferson's version of events was accepted by historians for many years. In 1950, Julian P. Boyd, the editor of Jefferson's papers, examined the extant drafts and determined that Jefferson's memory was faulty and that Dickinson claimed too much credit for the final text. According to Boyd, an initial draft was reportedly written by John Rutledge, a member of a committee of five appointed to create the Declaration. Rutledge's draft was not accepted and does not survive. Jefferson and Dickinson were then added to the committee. Jefferson was appointed to write a draft; how much he drew upon the lost Rutledge draft, if at all, is unknown. Jefferson then apparently submitted his draft to Dickinson, who suggested some changes, which Jefferson, for the most part, decided not to use. The result was that Dickinson rewrote the Declaration, keeping some passages written by Jefferson. Contrary to Jefferson's recollection in his old age, Dickinson's version was not less radical; according to Boyd, in some respects Dickinson's draft was more blunt. The bold statement near the end was written by Dickinson: \\"Our cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable.\\" The disagreement in 1775 between Dickinson and Jefferson appears to have been primarily a matter of style, not content.

Bellil became famous in France with the publication of her autobiographical book Dans l'enfer des tournantes ('In the hell of the \\"tournantes\\" (gang-rapes)) in 2002. The book discusses the violence she and other young women endured in the predominantly North African and African immigrant outskirts of Paris, where she was repeatedly gang-raped as a teenager by gangs led by people she knew, and then abandoned by her family and friends. Her book is a portrayal of the predicament of young girls in the poor, outlying suburbs (banlieue) of French cities. The book is available in English (translated by Lucy R. McNair) as To Hell and Back: The Life of Samira Bellil.https://www.amazon.ca/Hell-Back-Life- Samira- Bellil/dp/0803213565/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1425599879&sr;=8-2&keywords;=samira+bellil  Life  Bellil was born to Algerian parents in Algiers, but her family migrated to France and settled in the Parisian suburb of Val-d'Oise. Her father was jailed almost immediately and she was fostered by a family in Belgium for five years, before being called back to her parents. As a teenager Bellil rebelled against the traditional constraints of her community and wanted to live freely as a young French woman. Samira was first gang-raped when she was 14, by a gang led by someone she knew. They beat her viciously and raped her all night. A month later, one of the most violent attackers in the gang followed her and dragged her off a train by her hair, while other passengers looked the other way. She was then brutally raped by him again. She did not report her rapes until two friends told her that the same gang had sexually assaulted them too. Samira decided to appeal to the French legal system to prosecute her attackers. In the end, the ring leader of the gang was sentenced to eight years in prison. Bellil's parents, who believed they were shamed by her presence, expelled her from her house.The Guardian, Obituary. \\"People outside the community don't know,\\" Bellil has written. \\"And everyone in the community knows, but they won't say anything.\\" Eventually, she found a psychologist who helped her. She had years of therapy, and describes how she decided to write her book to show other young women gang-rape victims that there was a way out. \\"It's long and it's difficult, but it's possible,\\" she wrote in the dedication - to \\"my sisters in trouble\\". She used her real name and put her photo on the cover. She dedicated the book to her \\"girlfriends, so that they realize that one can overcome the traumatic\\" and to Boris Cyrulnik, her therapist. She later became a youth worker. She died on 4 September 2004 of stomach cancer. She was 31. Ni Putes Ni Soumises  Bellil helped found a young women's activist group called Ni Putes Ni Soumises (\\"Neither whores nor submissives\\") which has publicly addressed the issue of violence against young women in France. The group drew the attention of the French and European press as they organized marches and press conferences to bring attention to the tragic events happening to young women in the banlieue of France. She denounced the gang-rapes (known as tournantes, or \\"pass-arounds\\") and described how she overcame both her traumatic experiences and the need for revenge. Legacy She was chosen as one of the new Mariannes, the new faces of France. Her portrait has hung outside the French National Assembly.

At the junction of the main overland route with the main water route, Wasserburg became the most important trade centre with the Balkans, Austria and Italy, a means of attaining power and wealth for the shipping owners and merchants. In the early days, Wasserburg was an important hub in the salt trade. Its bridge was the only possibility to cross the river Inn for 30 km in both directions. On its shore the salt, mined in Berchtesgaden or produced in the Saline (saltern) at Bad Reichenhall and shipped from there by cart, could be loaded on ships travelling on the Inn River. Up to the 17th century Wasserburg was used as the port of the capital Munich. Up until 1972, when it was merged with the district Rosenheim, Wasserburg was a district capital on its own. Demography Wasserburg am Inn illustrated The population of Wasserburg is approx. 12,000. In literature Gustav Meyrink's most esoteric novel The White Dominican () is set in a mystical version of the town of Wasserburg.

Early life Born in Northumberland, England, Neville emigrated to Victoria, Australia as a child. Career In 1897, he went from Victoria to Western Australia and joined the civil service there, quickly rising through the ranks. In 1910, Neville was appointed as the secretary of a new department organising immigration and tourism, and assisted in fostering the migration of 40,000 people to in Western Australia over the next few years. Following the outbreak of World War I, he was appointed as secretary of the War Patriotic Fund. In 1915, Neville became the state's second appointment to the role of the Chief Protector of Aborigines. During the next quarter-century, he presided over the controversial policy of removing Aboriginal children from their families; children who came to be called the Stolen Generations. More than 69% of the Noongah people were removed in that way, and sent to \\"camps\\" at Mogumber at Moore River and Carrolup near Katanning. In 1936, Neville became the Commissioner for Native Affairs, a post he held until his retirement in 1940. The practice of removing mixed race Aboriginal/European children from their families was advocated at the time as part of a plan to \\"breed out the colour\\" by having those children brought up as though they were white, with the idea that they would marry people with light and lighter skin tones over successive generations, until there would be no Aborigines in Australia at all. At the time it was believed that full-blood Aborigines were dying out. In 1934, the WA government set up the Moseley Royal Commission, to examine the state of Aboriginal people with regard to the role of Chief Protector. The result was that the Chief Protector was given more authority over the lives of Western Australian Aboriginal people which, some say, only increased their suffering. In 1937, Neville declared: > Are we going to have one million blacks in the Commonwealth or are we going > to merge them into our white community and eventually forget that there were > any Aborigines in Australia? Neville believed that biological absorption was the key to 'uplifting the Native race.'Zalums, E (Elmar) and Stafford. H. (1980) A bibliography of Western Australian Royal Commissions, select committees of parliament and boards of inquiry, 1870-1979 Blackwood, S. Aust. E. Zalums & H. Stafford Speaking at the Moseley Royal Commission, he defended the policies of forced settlement, removing children from parents, surveillance, discipline and punishment, arguing that: > \\"[T]hey have to be protected against themselves whether they like it or not. > They cannot remain as they are. The sore spot requires the application of > the surgeon's knife for the good of the patient, and probably against the > patient's will.\\" Neville stated that children had not been removed indiscriminately, saying that: > \\"[T]he children who have been removed as wards of the Chief Protector have > been removed because I desired to be satisfied that the conditions > surrounding their upbringing were satisfactory, which they certainly were > not.\\" In 1947, he published Australia's Coloured Minority, a text outlining his plan for the biological absorption of Aboriginal people into non-Aboriginal Australia. The book defends his policy but also acknowledges that Aborigines had been harmed by European intervention. For that reason, he said, more had to be done to assist them: > \\"I make no apologies for writing the book, because there are things which > need to be said. So few of our own people as a whole are aware of the > position [of Aboriginies]. Yet we have had the coloured man amongst us for a > hundred years or more. He has died in his hundreds, nay thousands, in pain, > misery and squalor, and through avoidable ill-health. Innumerable little > children have perished through neglect and ignorance. The position, in some > vital respects, is not much better today than it was fifty years ago. Man is > entitled to a measure of happiness in his life. Yet most of these people > have never known real happiness. Some are never likely to know it. The > causes of their condition are many. Mainly it is not their fault, it is > ours, just as it lies with us to put the matter right.\\"Neville (1947), p.21. In 1947, following his retirement, he was invited to represent the State of Western Australia on discussions regarding Aboriginal Welfare in connection with the Woomera Test Range, prior to its establishment. Neville was a notable resident of Darlington, and was a regular user of the Eastern Railway which closed a few months before his death. He died in Perth, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.  Portrayals  Neville has been portrayed in artistic works as the public face of this policy in the 2002 film Rabbit Proof Fence (played by Kenneth Branagh), and in Jack Davis' 1985 play, No Sugar.

Because of the unusual circumstances of how their first fight ended, a rematch between Tszyu and Mitchell was deemed necessary. Their first fight Tszyu and Mitchell met for the first time on November 2, 2002, with Tszyu as the WBC world champion and Mitchell as the WBA world champion. They fought to unify those belts. The first fight was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. The fight was fought at close quarters, but there was also some rough tactics used by both boxers. Tszyu pushed Mitchell to the canvas four times. Whether the pushes were accidental or not was never known, but Mitchell injured his knee and declared himself unable to fight on during the seventh round, giving Tszyu an unlikely type of knockout. Critics and fan reaction to first fight One of the reasons that both Tszyu and Mitchell felt a rematch, apart from the fact that Mitchell claimed for three years after their first encounter that he was on his way to a win, was necessary was that most boxing magazine writers and fans alike felt that the first fight's result was inconclusive. Likewise, fans were split as to whom was winning the first fight between the co-champions: while Tszyu fans generally had him ahead, Mitchell fans felt Mitchell was winning it until the point when he could go on no longer. Problems to make the rematch happen Tszyu defeated Ben Tackie next, in February 2003, by a twelve-round unanimous decision, to retain the unified belts. Initially to be fought in late 2003 in Sydney, Australia, the Tszyu-Mitchell rematch had to be postponed because Tszyu injured his wrist during training. It was then rescheduled, to be fought during the summer of 2004, in Moscow, Russia. But Tszyu re-injured his wrist, forcing a second postponement. These two injuries caused Tszyu to be inactive for a total of twenty-two months. That and the fact that Mitchell's knee had also naturally become weaker after his own injury made many fans question the ability of both fighters to put on a good show in their rematch. The IBF, perhaps tired of waiting for Tszyu to defend the belts, named Mitchell their \\"interim champion\\". After further negotiations, it was agreed the fight should be held in Glendale, Arizona, where the Glendale Arena was relatively new and needed some big name events to be held there. Celebrities Sylvester Stallone attended the fight, as well as former world Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and Jr. Welterweight contender and interim WBA Jr. Welterweight champion Vivian Harris. The undercard The fight's undercard was filled with star boxers, with former world champions Yori Boy Campas and Joan Guzm√°n, as well as contenders Jermaine Woods and Jonathan Ochoa registering victories before the main event. Flag incidents Just before the boxers entered the ring for the main event, two fans brought out two Russian flags. They lit one, burning it. A second one would have been burnt; security promptly arrived and removed the fans from the arena, but not before they threw the second flag for other fans to get it. These other fans proceeded to stomp on the flag. The reasons for protesting using a Russian flag during the Tszyu fight are not totally clear: though Tszyu is Russian by birth, he has long since renounced his Russian citizenship; Australia is Tszyu's new homeland. The fight The Tszyu-Mitchell rematch was televised in the United States by Showtime, while, in Australia and Europe, it was shown on Pay Per View. The fight's referee was Raul Caiz, Sr.. Both fighters rushed out of their corners for round one. Tszyu was somewhat slower; he might have been trying to shake off some rust after not fighting for the aforementioned twenty-two months. Mitchell landed some heavy rights to Tszyu's chin, while the champion looked calm and composed. Mitchell outlanded Tszyu in this round. An important point of the fight was when both boxers clashed their heads before round one was finished, and Tszyu came out with a cut around his left eye. Perhaps afraid that the fight would be stopped because of the cut and declared a technical draw, Tszyu came out of his corner for round two like if he had a feeling of urgency. Midway towards the round, he landed a right to Mitchell's chin that staggered the former world champion. Mitchell then retreated to the ropes, near his own corner. Tszyu followed with a flurry of punches, and Mitchell fell from an uppercut. He fell near the ropes, almost the same way that Sugar Ray Leonard had dropped Thomas Hearns in round thirteen of their 1981 fight. Mitchell, visibly awakened, got up and continued fighting. Towards the end of the round, he landed a right to Tszyu's chin that made Tsyu's head snap back. Soon after round three began, Tszyu connected with a right hand to the chin that sent Mitchell to the canvas for the second time; he landed on a sitting position. Mitchell again rose, but Tszyu stayed over him, driving him to the ropes and landing blows to Mitchell's body before Mitchell suffered his second knockdown of the round and third of the fight. Once again, Mitchell rose, but he was trapped against the ropes. After another quick combination of blows to the body, Mitchell fell again, and referee Cadiz, Sr. proceeded to stop the fight.

Intended to compete with Disneyland, it replaced Ocean Park Pier (1926-1956). After it closed and fell into disrepair, the park and pier anchored the Dogtown area of Santa Monica. History Entrance Pacific Ocean Park Pacific Ocean Park was a joint venture between CBS and Santa Anita Park. It opened on Saturday, July 28, 1958 with an attendance of 20,000. The next day, the park drew 37,262, outperforming Disneyland's attendance that day. Admission was 90 cents for adults, which included access to the park and certain exhibits. It was locally known by the acronym POP, (pronounced \\"pee- oh-pee\\"), as it was soon nicknamed and commonly used to refer to the name of the park, was also marketed as \\"Pay One Price\\", though other rides and attractions were on a pay-per-use basis. Like Disneyland, Pacific Ocean Park found corporate sponsors to share the expense of some exhibits. Six of the pier's original attractions were incorporated into the new park, including the Sea Serpent roller coaster, the antique Looff carousel, the Toonerville Fun House, the Glass House and the twin diving bells. Attractions Among a standard complement of carnival-style attractions and rides were the following: *Westinghouse Enchanted Forest/ Submarine Exhibit featured a -long model of the atomic reactor section of a submarine. *House of Tomorrow was themed like similar \\"looks at the future\\" featured at Disneyland's Tomorrowland and the World's Fair. Elektro, the talking and smoking robot from the 1939 World's Fair, was a prominent display. *Sea Circus was included in the basic attraction price. Performing dolphins and sea lions played to audiences of 2,000 at a time. After the shows, visitors could feed seals in the Seal Pool. The Sea Circus Pacific Ocean Park *Diving Bells passengers were submerged underwater within dual diving bells that operated via hydraulic pistons. An underwater view of the tank was visible through the portholes. Similar rides also existed in single fashion at the Long Beach Nu-Pike and Coney Island's Astroland. The thrill of the ride occurred when the bell was allowed to surface. When the hydraulic pressure holding the bell down was released, the bell would shoot back up to the surface in dramatic fashion. The ride was manufactured by Martine. Sky Ride Pacific Ocean Park *Ocean Skyway, built by Von Roll, consisted of bubble-shaped gondolas suspended 75 feet (23 m) above the surface of the ocean. Passengers were treated to a half-mile (800 m) trip out to sea and back. *Union 76 Ocean Highway was similar to Disneyland's Autopia attraction. Visitors could drive miniature, gasoline- powered automobiles on a simulated highway. *Flight to Mars was an audio- visual presentation that simulated a trip to Mars. *Flying Carpet was a ride themed around the One Thousand and One Nights folk tales. \\"Flying carpets\\" suspended on an overhead track took visitors over an Arabian-themed diorama. *Mirror Maze was a standard funhouse attraction. *Davy Jones' Locker was another funhouse with a nautical theme. View of Mystery Island *Flying Dutchman was a dark ride similar in theme to Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean, but without the animatronic figures. *Deepest Deep simulated a voyage via submarine. Unlike Disneyland's Submarine Voyage attraction, Deepest Deep took place above water. *Round the World in 80 Turns was an unusual combination of travelogue and thrill ride. Tub-like ride vehicles whipped sharply to the right and left to show travel scenes from around the world. The attraction was closed during the middle of the park's second season following customer complaints of nausea and neck and back pain. *Safari Dark Ride was an interactive children's ride in which riders in miniature Jeeps used an electronic rifle to \\"hunt\\" animals in the African jungle. *Mystery Island Banana Train Ride was considered by many to be Pacific Ocean Park's best ride. Passengers were treated to a trip aboard a tropical banana plantation train, complete with a simulated volcano and simulated earthquakes. *Sea Serpent Roller Coaster was a wooden, 1926 Hi-Boy rollercoaster from the original pier. Gangplank to Mystery Island Banana Train attraction *Mahi Mahi was a massive Stantzel Strat-O-Liner tower with rotating arms ending in jet-style cars, each of which held eight passengers. Six of these rides were manufactured, but none exist today. *Whirl Pool was a centrifuge that pinned riders to the walls as the floor slowly lowered beneath them. *Mr. Dolphin was another original pier attraction. *Flying Fish was a miniature rollercoaster made by Carlos and Ramigosi. It was the first steel Wild Mouse roller coaster in the U.S. The Midway at Pacific Ocean Park *Carousel was the 1926-vintage Looff carousel from the original pier. *Fisherman's Cove and the International Promenade were shopping, dining and souvenir areas that featured a number of international restaurants. *King Neptune's Courtyard was a colorful walk under the ocean to view King Neptune's lair. *Mrs.Squid, also known as the Ahuna Thrill Ride, was an Eyerly Octopus ride with a squid decor in the center. The ride had 16 tubs, each carrying two passengers. *Mr. Octopus was a standard Eyerly Octopus ride with eight tubs. *Space Wheels, a unique pair of double Ferris wheels, was manufactured by Velare Brothers. This attraction still exists and is owned by Drew Exposition of Georgia. *Fun Forest was a children's area with mazes and slides as well as helicopter, boat, monorail and covered-wagon rides. By January 5, 1959, Pacific Ocean Park had attracted 1,190,000 visitors. Although plans were made to add four new attractions, only two of these were completed at a cost of $2,000,000: Space Wheels and Fun Forest. Film location The park was used as a filming location for television shows, such as The Fugitive, The Twilight Zone and The Mod Squad, and films such as Gun Crazy (1950), Vicki (1953) and The Chapman Report (1962). Decline Aerial view of Pacific Ocean Park In 1965, Santa Monica began the Ocean Park urban renewal project. Buildings in the surrounding area were demolished and streets leading to the park were closed. As a result, visitors found it difficult to reach the park, and attendance plummeted to 621,000 in 1965 and 398,700 in 1966. At the end of the 1967 tourist season, the park's creditors and the City of Santa Monica filed suit to take control of the property because of back taxes and back rent owed by the park's new owner since 1965. Pacific Ocean Park closed on October 6, 1967. The park's assets were auctioned off from June 28-30, 1968. The proceeds from the sale of 36 rides and 16 games were used to pay off creditors. The ruins of the pier became a favorite surfing area and hangout of the Z-Boys of Dogtown fame. The park's dilapidated buildings and pier structure remained until several suspicious fires occurred and it was finally demolished in the winter of 1974-75. Other than a few underwater pilings and signs warning of them, nothing remains of Pacific Ocean Park today. A few miles north, the original Santa Monica Pier features a newer amusement park, similarly called Pacific Park. Today, the rides and attractions of the Santa Monica Pier include the carousel that is featured in the 1973 Academy Award- winning film The Sting.

It is one of the largest enclosed shopping centres in Canada, and the largest shopping mall in York Region with almost of retail space. The complex has over 200 retail stores, restaurants, and entertainment outlets. The mall is served by York Region Transit bus routes at the Vaughan Mills Terminal, with regular service to the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre on Line 1 Yonge-University of the Toronto subway. History Vaughan Mills site in October 2000. The shopping centre was designed and built by Ivanho√© Cambridge and the Mills Corporation, the latter of which owned a portfolio of malls across the United States. JPRA served as the design architect for the centre, with Bregman + Hamann Architects as the project architect. Like its American counterparts, Vaughan Mills incorporates a \\"race track\\" layout to maximize the exposure of the mall tenants. When Vaughan Mills was conceived in 1999, it was meant to be a slightly larger complex at 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m¬≤), with up to 18 anchor retailers and a combined 245 stores and services. The shopping centre was intended to be a stepping stone for American retailers who wanted to enter the Canadian market, however Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World was the only U.S. retailer to make its exclusive launch there, while other anticipated retailers such as Bed, Bath and Beyond and Burlington Coat Factory never opened at Vaughan Mills. In September 1999, Bed Bath & Beyond and Sun & Ski Sports were among the six American retailers that were announced as Vaughan Mills' first anchor tenants. An ESPN X Games Skatepark was also planned as the main entertainment venue site. The mall opened on November 4, 2004, and was the first regional enclosed shopping complex to be opened in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) since the Erin Mills Town Centre in 1990 as well as the first in the GTA built in the 21st century. The mall had its two-millionth visitor less than two months after its opening. Vaughan Mills receives over 13.5 million patrons per year. In August 2006, the Mills Corporation sold its stake in Vaughan Mills to partner Ivanho√© Cambridge. In January 2013, plans were announced for an expansion of 150,000 square feet and 50 new stores to the mall, which opened in late 2014. On March 17, 2016, Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th opened a store in the mall. The mall added the first Legoland Discovery Centre in Canada. Stylesense and NASCAR Speedpark were closed in early 2012. They have been replaced by Calvin Klein and Legoland. In 2018, Japanese retailer Uniqlo announced an expansion to open four new locations in malls, including Vaughan Mills, which opened on September 28, 2018, in the former HR2 location. Public transport Vaughan Mills Terminal is a transit terminal in York Region, Ontario, Canada, at 1 Bass Pro Mills Drive, near the northeast corridor of Vaughan Mills and the intersection of Rutherford Road and Jane Street in Vaughan, Ontario. As of 2017, oneRide ticket machines are installed at this terminal. Only York Region Transit (YRT) routes connect to this terminal. Sister malls in Canada Ivanho√© Cambridge stated in 2011 that their strategic plan was to have four sister malls in Canada, with Vaughan Mills as the first, and additional locations to be located near Calgary, Vancouver and Montreal. CrossIron Mills, located outside of Calgary, Alberta, opened on August 19, 2009. It has a number of the same retailers as the Vaughan Mills Mall, including Bass Pro Shops. The CrossIron Mills location opened in the spring of 2009, several months ahead of the main mall. The construction, leasing, and opening of the mall has paralleled Vaughan Mills to a degree, as it, too, has occurred during an economic recession. Tsawwassen Mills, located in Delta, British Columbia, at Highway 17 and 52nd Street on Tsawwassen First Nation Lands south of Vancouver. Construction began in January 2014 and the mall opened on October 5, 2016. Tsawwassen Mills is designed in a similar format to its sister malls and includes approximately of retail. Plans call for 16 anchor retailers, including the first Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World location in British Columbia announced as the first anchor tenant. Ivanho√© Cambridge had originally planned to build what would have been called Laval Mills in Laval, Quebec near Montreal, at the intersection of Quebec Autoroute 440 and Quebec Autoroute 25. However, after three years of planning and analysis, these plans were abandoned in May 2011 citing that their criteria of feasibility and profitability were not met, partly because environmental issues as construction would have disrupted a number of wetlands on or directly connection to the project. At the time the project was cancelled Ivanho√© Cambridge stated they would continue plans for a Mills mall to be built in the Montreal region.

In the first round, the players attempted to take control of the eight groups of colored properties on a giant Monopoly board. To do so, they had to solve crossword-style clues. The first letter of each answer was given to the players, and each side of the four-sided board, referred to as \\"blocks\\" (with the block containing the five properties between the Go to Jail corner and \\"GO\\" referred to as the \\"high rent district\\"), had a different starting letter for clues. Each clue was a toss-up, and answering correctly won money equal to the value of the property, from $60 for Mediterranean Avenue to $400 for Boardwalk. Answering incorrectly deducted that value from a player's score. In the event that all three players failed to answer a clue, the property value was cut in half and another clue was read. Each color group, referred to as a monopoly, had to be controlled by one of the players before play moved on to another. Once a player controlled a monopoly, the total monetary value of its properties was added to his/her score. The lowest monopoly value was $120, which was for Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues. The highest was $920, for the three-property monopoly consisting of Pacific, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania Avenues. If the properties in a monopoly ended up under the control of multiple players, a series of toss-up clues were played between them to determine ownership. A player who owned two properties in a group of three had to give one correct answer in order to take full control, while the player who owned the third had to give two. If all three players each owned one property, the first to give a correct answer challenged one opponent and took over the property of the other, and the remainder of the showdown followed the two-player format. An incorrect answer on the initial toss-up forfeited that player's property, which was then awarded to one of the others through a second toss-up. In the case of the Mediterranean/Baltic and Park Place/Boardwalk monopolies being split between two players, the first to answer a clue correctly took control. =Big Money Round= During the commercial break following the completion of the first round, the players used the money they had earned to build houses and hotels on their properties. These cost $50 and $250 respectively, regardless of the properties' position on the board, and players had to build evenly within a color group. The number of houses/hotels on a property determined the amount of its rent, which was used as the value of its clues. Once the players' construction purchases had been revealed and the corresponding cost deducted from their scores, the Big Money Round began. An indicator light started at \\"GO\\" and moved clockwise around the board, according to the total of two oversized dice rolled by the show's hostess. Every player received a $200 bonus whenever the indicator light passed or landed on \\"GO.\\" If a property was landed on, O'Donnell called out its rent value and Reilly read a question to the player who owned it. A correct response added the rent value to his/her score. A miss incurred no penalty but allowed either of the opponents to buzz in under the same rules as the first round, with an incorrect answer deducting from that player's score. Squares other than properties affected the gameplay as follows: *Utilities (Electric Company and Water Works): a tossup clue was asked, worth $100 times the total on the dice. *Railroads: if the indicator light landed on one of the four railroads, players got the chance to \\"ride\\" the particular railroad to a monopoly and initiate a \\"hostile takeover\\". A tossup was asked, and the first player to answer the clue correctly chose one of his/her opponents' monopolies to take over. The indicator light then moved to the first property in the chosen monopoly, and the player trying to take it over had to answer a series of clues unopposed, one for each property. Every correct answer advanced the indicator light to the next property in line. If the player answered all the clues correctly, he/she won control of the monopoly; its combined value was added to his/her score, and any houses or hotels built on it became his/her property. A wrong answer ended the takeover attempt and the player had to pay the corresponding rent to the owner of the monopoly, based on where the indicator was when the wrong answer was given. *Chance and Community Chest: a card was drawn from the appropriate deck and its instructions (bonuses, fines, movement) were followed. *Tax Spaces: landing on Income Tax deducted 10% from every player's score, while Luxury Tax deducted $75. *Free Parking: a tossup was asked and the first player to answer correctly won $500, plus all money collected in taxes/fines since the last correct Free Parking response. *Go To Jail: if the indicator landed on this space, it moved to the \\"In Jail\\" space and each player lost $250. The second round was played until time was called. At this point, all houses and hotels were sold back to the bank at their original purchase price and the money was credited to the players who owned the properties, regardless of who had originally built them. The player with the highest total won the game, kept his/her money, and advanced to the bonus round. =Bonus Round (\\"Once Around the Board\\")= The champion tried to complete one full clockwise circuit of the board within five turns while staying out of Jail. He/she first had to choose four spaces ‚Äì one each on the maroon/orange and red/yellow sides, and two on the green/blue side ‚Äì to become Go to Jail spaces. The original Go to Jail space remained on the board, for a total of five. The champion started at \\"GO\\" and rolled the dice to move around the board. As long as he/she did not land on a Go to Jail space and had turns remaining, he/she could quit the round and take $100 per space passed. Rolling doubles awarded an extra turn. If the champion landed on a Go to Jail space at any time, the round ended and he/she forfeited the money. The champion won $25,000 for passing \\"GO\\" without running out of turns, or $50,000 for landing on \\"GO\\" exactly. If he/she ran out of turns and had avoided Jail, he/she still collected $100 per space passed. Production information Merv Griffin created the series and served as executive producer. Monopoly was paired with Super Jeopardy! for its 12-week run on ABC. Coincidentally, host Mike Reilly competed on the television game show Jeopardy! in 1989. Reilly later worked as a waiter before being selected a year later by producer Merv Griffin to perform as a contestant on the pilot for Monopoly. After the pilot with Peter Tomarken as host was taped, Reilly was selected as host. The pilot was produced for syndication, but could not gain clearances - likely due to the use of a female dwarf to play \\"Rich Uncle Pennybags\\". Tomarken clashed with producers about the use of \\"Rich Uncle Pennybags\\", calling it tasteless and comparing it to slavery. International version A Welsh version of the show, hosted by Derec Brown aired on S4C for a brief period in 1992.

It is loosely based on the Korean game Legend of Darkness. The American version was developed by David Ethan Kennerly who based it somewhat on the works of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. The game originally thrived on player involvement in the management of the game and progression of the storyline, even going so far as allowing players control over in-game politics and laws. Setting The backstory essentially is that a long time past, the people called Tuatha de Danaan (\\"Children of Danaan\\") arrived in the lands of Temuair, meaning Earth-Sea in the Tuathan tongue. There was formed the civilization called Hy-brasyl. It was a peaceful time, in harmony with nature. For the first time, after a millennium of peace had existed, a man is found murdered, and exploration into the outside world begins. With this comes the harnessing of the elements for magical power. Along with this exploration, Kadath, the worldly home of the Gods, is discovered. Dark altars and temples are constructed, and the Priests of these Dark Gods go crazy in their search for Godly knowledge. In this madness, Hy- brasyl is drowned, with the death of all those who know the forbidden knowledge. Over 300 years go by until the knowledge is regained, and along with the four other elements (Fire, Earth, Water, Wind), a fifth is discovered: Darkness. With this discovery come the Dubhaimid, the dark ones. Formed by the Dark God Chadul, these dark forces terrorize Temuair. The wise amongst the Tuatha de Danaan return to the worship of the Light Goddess Danaan, who enters into the Great War with Chadul. Many years later, the Six Lords of Temuair meet to form an unholy Pact with Chadul. Led by Tenes, King of Ardmagh, the Anaman Pact is formed, granting each of the Lords a 1000-year lifespan and the unity of Temuair. In the ensuing war, Danaan's chosen Paladin, Ainmeal, fights against Tenes in battle and wins, ending another dark threat. Ainmeal renames Ardmagh to \\"Loures.\\" Again much time of peace passes, until the 4th Empress of Loures, Ealagad, comes to power. She seeks to rekindle the power of Chadul and does so, restoring the Dubhaimid to Temuair. Danaan again intervenes, this time by sacrificing Herself in order to defeat Chadul for the final time. With the end of this Shadows War, the first of the Aislings (Dreamers) are born, free from their old mundane life, and making a difference in the new Atavism Age. Character customization Players begin the game with the creation of a new character. They may select a name up to 12 characters long. They may then select the gender and hair color of the character. A limited selection of gender-specific hairstyles is then chosen, eighteen styles for males, seventeen styles for females. Players then enter their desired password and enter the game as the default Peasant class. Characters are broken up into the archetypal character classes of Warrior, Monk, Priest, Wizard and Rogue, with the default being Peasant. In order to become one of the common classes, players must enter a specific building in the starting town of Mileth. They may bring a player of the desired class to initiate them into the class, or may elect to do so alone, with the NPC as their initiator. Darkages uses a system of 5 primary stats and 4 secondary stats. Primary stats start at 3, and 2 primary stat points are gained every time a character increases in level. These points can be spent to increase a character's stats. Stats can also be altered by gear worn by the character. The primary stats are STR (Strength), CON (Constitution), DEX (Dexterity), INT (Intelligence), and WIS (Wisdom). STR determines the damage of many melee combat skill and assails, the maximum weight limit of gear worn and carried in a character's inventory. CON determines the amount of health regenerated per cycle, the amount of health gained upon leveling and the damage of certain monk skills. DEX determines the chance to evade melee attacks, and the damage of some rogue skills. INT determines the damage inflicted by damage spells. WIS determines the amount of mana regenerated per cycle, mana gained upon leveling, and the amount healed by priest healing spells. The secondary stats are MR (Magic Resistance), AC (Armor Class), HIT, and DMG (Damage). Secondary stats are modified by gear. MR determines the odds of a hostile spell missing a character. Characters start with a base MR of 0. AC determines how much damage is reduced when dealt to a character. Characters start with a base AC of 100; improvements to armor class lower the number, while negative effects, such as the curse spell used by Priests, \\"Ard Cradh\\", increase armor class. HIT determines the likelihood of an assail skill hitting. DMG increases the damage of assail skills. Characters start with a base HIT and DMG of 0. Learning skills and spells require the character to have a certain amount of each stat, for example for a Warrior to learn the \\"Windblade\\" ability he must raise his INT and CON to 5, STR to 6, and DEX to 12. Only then may he learn the ability after presenting the trainer with a specific item(s) and/or gold. Many players plan their character around using items to boost stats so they can learn skills with the fewest points actually spent possible, enabling the excess points to be spent in CON or WIS, allowing the character to enjoy a greatly improved HP or MP pool and regeneration while leveling. HP and MP are the standards hit point and magic points. HP is reduced from receiving damage in combat from enemies, and if it is reduced to 0 results in the death of the character except under special circumstances. If a character is a member of a party, instead of immediate death the character is in a swooning state in which they cannot move or use skills, spells, potions or complete any action other than speech. It is commonly called Skulling in the game, in reference to the skull which appears over the character head for a short duration. Other characters may use a specialized potion to cancel the effect and return the character to 1 HP during the duration. Otherwise the spell ends and the character dies per usual. HP and MP are increased every time the character gains a level based on a mathematical formula involving the characters CON stat for HP or the characters WIS stat for MP. =Classes= Though a default class, players may choose to advance the Peasant class to level ninety nine. This class has no class specific weapons or armors and receives the benefit of no special class specific skills or spells. Any equipment which a peasant can use and wield can be used or wielded by any of the other classes in the game. This class does however enjoy the benefit of the lowest experience points required to level up balanced by being the most difficult class to level up, having no skills or spells. A peasant may place all one hundred and ninety six points gained from their levels into any of their stats as there is no limit on a peasants stats. The archetypal fighting class is the Warrior. Warriors excel in hand-to-hand combat and gain the most armor value from their class specific armors. They have a small selection of shields and one handed weapons which only warrior may use and a selection of two handed weapons. This class gains the benefit of the most instant melee skills. Warriors also have a number of class specific combat skills most of which cause damage to targets in combat. Most of these skills have short cooldown periods. The warrior class has a very limited selection of spells, mostly only to attract enemy monsters or assist the characters defense against attack. Warriors smith many common weapons to become lighter and cause more damage. The Monk is the master of hand-to-hand fighting. They have a very limited selection of class specific weapon, most of which are hand claw type weapons. Monks enjoy a number of class specific skills and spells, most of which are combat skills and used to mitigate their more limited selection of instant melee skills. The monk class has the next highest armor rating of their class specific armors, after warriors. While monks may use any common weapons, many of their class skills require them to have either no weapon or monk-only weapons equipped in order to function. The majority of a monk's combat damage is from their skills. Their spell selection is less limited than the warriors as they have the ability to remove blindness and poison status from themselves or other characters some slight healing spells and defense spells that can provide complete invincibility to damage for a brief amount of time. Monks may also practice herbalism to create potions which have similar effect to their spells. Many of the monk's skills and spells are based on the monk teaching Dugons to other monks. Dugons are similar to the belt system of karate in theory, but progress to the next dugon is based on how many pupils the monk has taught dugons to. The Rogue' is touted as the intermediate class between the basher classes and the caster classes though the class functions more as a basher. Rogues heavily rely on trap skills which places a damage or status inflicting trap on a tile on which enemies must step. Rogue traps either cause damage or poison, blind or sleep status. Rogues have the ability to hide from monsters and other characters in order to move around without attention. Rogues have a decent ability in hand-to-hand combat and have a number of class specific weapons; melee daggers or thrown daggers and shuriken type weapons called surigams. Rogues may also change the hairstyle of other characters from a selection of around 80 gender specific styles. They have the next strongest armors from monks. Rogues can also smith their class specific weapons to become lighter and cause more damage. The Priest class has very few abilities in hand-to-hand combat and is a poor melee fighter. Their armors are the second weakest of all common classes. Priests enjoy a very large selection of spells most of which protect themselves or others from danger either through removing of curses which cause armours values to drop, remove most negative status ailments or healing other characters. The class also enjoys a wide variety of spells which cause status ailments of blindness, sleep, poison, frozen in place, or curses which reduce armor values. The priest class also casts a limited selection of direct damage spells, which are based on the Light element. Priest specific weapons are specialized staffs which reduce the waiting time for their spells to discharge. Priests may also create the same potions as monks. They are the only class which can progress beyond Acolyte status in the eight religious shrines. The Wizard is the archetypal magical attacker. This class also has very few abilities in hand-to-hand combat making them a poor melee fighter. Their amours are the weakest in the game rendering wizards the most susceptible to damage from enemies. Wizards are masters of the elements and most of their spells are based on the four elements of fire, air, earth and water called in the game, respectively; srad, athar, creag and sal. Their spells revolve around causing direct damage with elemental spells, and although a max level wizard can decimate entire legions of foes from afar with a wide variety of potent spells, a wizard who is still in the process of leveling will find it very impractical to attempt to be a damage dealer and will instead only focus on strengthening the elemental affinities of friends and foes‚Äîstrong spells require lots of stats, nobody expects (or wants) wizards to deal damage in a group setting while leveling, and not pumping WIS will result in a vastly lower MP pool, plus you can just pick up the spells you missed leveling up at 99. For these reasons most wizards plan their character with level 99 in mind and pump their WIS very high as early as possible, resulting in giant mana pools compared to a character that does not. Wizards can also increase the elemental affinity of enemies or allies (a very important mechanic in Dark Ages), and switching the elemental affinities of enemies. Unfortunately the latter function of forced elemental affinity switching does not work on any enemies the same level or higher than the wizard, rendering it useless against any enemies that a top level wizard would fight. Wizards may learn Dark element spells which cause direct damage in combat. Wizards also gain some spells that steal mp from group members or draw mp from specialized potions which contain the essence of the elements. Wizards can also enchant equipment either to become lighter and make the wearer more likely to successfully strike their opponent, detract less mp from the wearer or grant extra mp to the wearer, make the wearer cause more damage, or get an increase in hp from the gear. Wizards may practice alchemy to create some items. They may also practice necromancy which summons monsters to fight for the wizard. Wizard specific weapons are staffs which predominantly lower the time needed for spells to discharge. =Rededication, mastering and grand mastering= All classes except peasant may either rededicate their class or become a master of their class once they reach level ninety nine in their class. If the character wishes to Master their class, they must obtain specific items used to the \\"Mastering\\" process. Rededicating their class means they choose to become one of the other four common classes, losing all their levels and becoming unable to use their old class's weapons and armor, but keeping the abilities learned in the previous class. The correct term for this is Rededication, however this is commonly referred to by players colloquially as \\"subbing.\\" Once a character has reached level ninety nine in their class or their new class, they may Master. Mastering grants the ability to raise your stats to the maximum level of their respective class, as well as a specialized weapon and armor. Masters also learn some new class specific skills/spells. Those with only one class, called Pures in the game, gain additional skills or spells which rededicated subs do not receive. Although in the past the pure- only skills were very weak (and even further in the past there were no benefits to staying pure at all,) today the pure-only skills are extremely potent and are finally worth the enormous sacrifice of every pre-99 ability of another class. Once a character is a master they may turn experience into more HP or MP, and turn any excess HP over a minimum requirement into bonus stats (although the limit for stats is capped based on your class, HP and MP levels are NOT.) Grand mastering is accomplished by completing very long and tough quests that will require the help of friends and rewards you with class- specific equipment that is superior to your Master equipment. There is no title change to \\"Grand Master\\" and no new abilities, but the Grand Master equipment is much flashier and much stronger than the Master equipment, and looks differently for Pures and Subs. =Advanced Classes= The warrior, monk, rogue, priest and wizard classes may all upgrade their class after mastering and completing the grand master quests. The character may then elect to sacrifice the master and grandmaster weapons and armors and sacrifice some accumulated experience, HP and MP. Warriors become Gladiators'. Monks become Druids. Rogues become Archers. Priests become Bards. Wizards become Summoners. The class's style of gameplay is altered with the class change, and new skills and spells are gained. Characters also learn the use of new weapons, and may wear new class specific armors in their new class. The advanced classes function similarly to the common classes, albeit instead of accumulating experience to gain levels, the character accumulated ability points to increase ability levels. Certain enemies give ability points as well as experience points when defeated. Some quests give both exp and ap, and some give only ap. Gameplay The view in darkages is isometric except when leaving certain zones. Zones will either link to another zone at specific points, or else lead to a world map. When a player leaves a zone and goes onto the world map the player will click map points to change location to a new zone. Some zones may only be clicked by approaching from other specific zones, giving movement a feel of travel. Movement in a zone is based on the cardinal directions, in a skewed view. The Up arrow corresponds to cardinal northeast. Movement is accomplished by turning or moving with the arrow keys or by right clicking tiles on the map to walk to. Combat occurs in real-time, in the standard isometric view, usually in specific hunting grounds. Players may hold the spacebar to attack adjacent enemies with assails. This will cease when the spacebar is released. They may also double right click the target to attack. Double right clicking an enemy will both walk the character to whatever adjacent side is closest, and will use the assail skills until the character faces or moves away, presses the spacebar or is defeated. Skills and spells all appear in a specific window pane, and may either be clicked to activate unless the specific skill or spell also requires targeting. In such a case the player also clicks their mouse on the target. Alternatively, skills or spells which must have a target may be dragged from the skill or spell pane onto the target and the skill or spell is used. The 1 through = keys are hotkeys and may be pressed to use the appropriate skill or spell, subject to the targeting function. =Combat= Much of the focus of gameplay is combat either in hunting grounds or in certain specific PvP areas. There are numerous hunting grounds in Darkages. Many hunting grounds are designed for characters of specific levels or ability levels. They may have a broad or narrow range and may exclude characters above or below the thresholds of entry. Some hunting grounds are for gaining experience only and some are for gaining both experience points and ability points. Some are only opened by completing or engaging in specific quests. Many hunting grounds are only hunted for the items or money that can be acquired therein. There are three PvP forums in darkages and one team arena. The first, called honour fields, is for solo combat between warriors only in a small arena. The second, called the arena, is for registered players only, and contains the team arena, a free-for-all pvp arena and an arena for hosted matches of one to four teams. The team arena pits two teams against each other fighting for control of three towers and points are accumulated for defeating the other team players, for taking control of a tower and points accumulate over time for each tower controlled. The last PvP forum is the Medenia arena. There are three different zones in the arena and any character registered or not may enter and compete. There is also a PvE quest in this arena for registered characters. =Quests= Quests are accomplished in the routine manner; they are also very few and long; speaking to different NPCs in story arcs, bringing specific items to NPCs or delivering goods from one to another. Many quests involve entering specific hunting grounds and defeating a particular monster which may only be attempted as part of the quest. The amount of quests in darkages is quite limited in comparison to other mmo's. The benefit of quests are varied some granting exp or ap, some give new items. Some quests grant access to new zones. =Religion= Temuair Faiths Each Temple has a clergy made entirely of players. Players may hold any of the following ranks: Probate is the rank of initiated, unregistered players. It is also the rank of any Priest who has been the target of a heresy action. These people have the ability to pray when in the Temple of their God. Worshipper is the rank of initiated, registered players. These people have the ability to pray in the Temple of their God or when elsewhere, by use of their Prayer Necklace. They may also be sent on religious geasea by any Priest or higher of their Temple. Acolyt is the rank of Clergy-Helper. These people must be appointed by a person of rank Priest or higher. They have all the abilities of a Worshipper, as well as the ability to summon creatures of their God. They may also receive Holy Symbols of their God from a Cleric or higher. If a Priest or a Wizard, they may also receive a Holy or Magus staff of their God. Acolytes also have the ability to remove an enemy God's blessing from an item. Acolytes are also the only people who may begin a heresy action, which removes a Priest or higher from power. Priest is the lowest rank of the actual Clergy, and is obtainable only by members of the Priest class. To become a Priest, you must have been an Acolyte for two double-moons (two weeks). Priests have the ability to initiate new worshippers, banish people from the Temple, and consecrate items (adding their God's touch to the item). They may also invite unregistered people into the Temple. Priests have the ability to hold a Mass, which gives all present worshippers of the Trinity 50k experience. Priests can also destroy items if they are touched by an enemy God, or may simply remove the enemy God's touch. Priests are also able to send Worshippers or higher on Geasea. Cleric is obtainable only by those who have won a rank of \\"Clave\\" or above in any contest. They must have initiated at least 40 people in order to obtain Cleric alone, or 20 people if assisted by a Minister or higher. Clerics have all the abilities of a Priest, and may also create Holy Symbols, Holy Staves of their God, and Magus Staves of their God. Minister is obtainable only by those who have won a rank of \\"Village\\" or above in any contest. They must have initiated at least 40 people in order to obtain Minister alone, or 80 people if assisted by a High Priest. Ministers have all the abilities of a Cleric. High Priest is obtainable also by those who have won a rank of \\"Village\\" or above in any contest. They must have initiated at least 160 people into their Temple. High Priests have all the abilities of a Minister, and may also excommunicate members. This act will cause the High Priest to lose ten initiations, lose all of his faith, and will forcibly remove any member of the Fellowship from the Fellowship. Medenian Faiths The medenian faiths are very simple. The character chooses one of the 3 elemental spirits to offer prayers to. The character may remain a member of a temuair faith while being in a medenian faith. The character may pray to the spirit to increase standing in the faith. When groups of characters pray together under specific circumstances they may be furnished with a special pet or item. =Politics= One of the other unique features of Dark Ages created by David Ethan Kennerly is the political system. Originally only two towns - Rucesion and Mileth - were involved in the player run politics, but later the separate in-game continent of Medenia has also developed a player-run politic of its very own. [the following details relate to the original political systems of Rucesion and Mileth only]. An update to the game in 2017 reduced clout requirements to hold political office. Clout is a meta-currency stored on a character's legend, and is gained through other players \\"voting\\", which can be done once per 12 hours, or through winning a contest. Respected Citizen is not a true political position. It requires 5 clout (previously 10), and it requires that you have mentored at least one person. You gain the ability to admit people as citizens of your town, and the ability to dye clothing with the help of another tailor. Judicial Branch Guard is a rank where the holder enforces the town's laws. Guards must have been a Respected Citizen for at least one term, and require 10 clout (previously 25) to take office. They may banish any person from their town for 24 hours. They may also sponsor others to run for political office. They wear a green or blue tabard, depending on what town they are from. Guard Captain is a rank above Guard. Guard Captains must have four terms of Guard, and require 20 clout (previously 50) to take office. They have the same abilities as a Guard, and wear the same tabard with the addition of a helmet indicating their higher status. They organize the Guards, hold meetings, and review cases brought to them. Judge is the highest judicial rank. Judges must have held four terms of Guard Captain and require 25 clout (previously 100) to take office. They may hold trials, which is where citizens try to appeal banishments and exiles. These trials involve a jury, prosecutor, and defendant. They may also sponsor others to run for political office. Judges wear a fluffy robe colored with their town's color. Judges may perform the same functions as Guards and Guard Captains, as well as order exiles, removals of bad officials, and barment from office. They may also order a player be Sgathed, which is a form of capital punishment for the worst offenders. Legislative Branch Demagogue is the lowest rank of the Legislative Branch. Demagogues must have held four terms of Respected Citizen, and require 20 clout (previously 50) to take office. They may make the town's laws, and also may exile people from their town permanently upon a Judge's order. Demagogues may also sponsor others for political office. Demagogues wear a full-body robe of their town's color. Burgess is the highest rank of the Legislative Branch. Burgesses must have held four terms of Demagogue and require 50 clout (previously 200) to take office. They have the same power as Demagogues, but are often granted other responsibilities and powers by the town's laws. Outside the towns Outside of the towns, there are two other forces that uphold Mundane Mandate (Terms of Service). The ones that do the actual ToS-enforcement are a group called the Rangers. They can be recognized by their yellow tabards. They have the ability to jail people for violating the Terms of Service, and arrest individuals for automated improvement of skills and spells. Both a jailing and an arrest place a player in a jail cell in the dungeon of the capital city. Players that have been jailed will be confined to the cell for four hours to 7 days, depending on the number of jails accumulated. Players who have been arrested may walk out of the jail cell at any point. Once you reach a certain number of arrests, you may be blocked from the game; currently, reaching a total of six jails and/or arrests will result in losing access to your character for a period of time. The other force is the Knights, who act as KRU's agents in the game. They handle player requests and ideas. However, they also report extreme abuses to KRU directly. ToS violations outside of player run towns are the exclusive remit of Rangers. Knights and to a certain extent rangers are appointed through nomination and merit, respectively. =Nobility= There is a contest system in Dark Ages. The players enter works of literature or art as a contest entry, to be judged by previous winners. The game developers have a final say on what award specific content is awarded. Players submit their entries in different categories. Literature' entries are short stories or poetry relating to the theme of the game or characters in the game world. History entries are stories written as historical documents which relate to the story-line of the game and may influence the plots of content released by the developer. Lore entries are compendiums of factual technical information relating to the game; item lists, monsters statistics, maps and such things. Philosophy entries are philosophical theories of the role-played character, relating to the game world and how the character relates to it. Art entries are any works of art the player has created that have a basis in the theme of the game world. Drawings or paintings of the imagined settings or characters or monsters, sculptures of game figures, web comics or animation etc. The music category was removed from the contest system, though works of music could perhaps be entered as art entries. Players who create these works may choose to enter them after attaining education points from attending make believe classes hosted by previous contest winners. Players gain in game rewards after winning a contest. They may also form new guilds, teach in the college themselves, and judge new contest entries upon becoming a noble. Nobles also have the power to remove people from the college area, and denounce other nobles which can remove their awards. Noble priests have the right to advance further in their respective religions.

They are so named for their coloration, which is similar in color to port wine, a fortified red wine from Portugal. A port-wine stain is a capillary malformation, seen at birth. Port-wine stains always persist throughout life. The area of skin affected grows in proportion to general growth. Port-wine stains occur most often on the face but can appear anywhere on the body, particularly on the neck, upper trunk, arms and legs. Early stains are usually flat and pink in appearance. As the child matures, the color may deepen to a dark red or purplish color. In adulthood, thickening of the lesion or the development of small lumps may occur. Port-wine stains may be part of a syndrome such as Sturge‚ÄìWeber syndrome or Klippel‚ÄìTr√©naunay‚ÄìWeber syndrome. Types Mikhail Gorbachev, last leader of the Soviet Union, with a prominent port-wine stain on his forehead Nevus flammeus may be divided as follows:James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 582‚Äì3. . *Nevus flammeus nuchae *Midline nevus flammeus Genetics Port-wine stains were shown to be caused by a somatic activating c.548G‚ÜíA mutation in the GNAQ gene. An association with RASA1 has also been described. Diagnosis A healthcare provider can usually diagnose a port-wine stain based entirely upon the history and appearance. In unusual cases, a skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the location of the birthmark and other associated symptoms, a physician may choose to order a measurement of intraocular pressure or X-ray of the skull. An MRI of the brain may be performed (under anesthesia) on infants who have a port-wine stain in the head area in order to check for signs of Sturge-Weber syndrome. If the port-wine stain is inside the mouth, a provider may check the insides of a newborn baby's throat with a scope to see if there are any changes (growths) other than just the color. If the port-wine stain is around the eye or on the eyelid, a referral may be made to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a test of the ocular pressures in that eye. If swelling occurs in the port-wine stain, it may cause vision problems, glaucoma, or blindness. Treatment Many treatments have been tried for port-wine stains including freezing, surgery, radiation, and tattooing; port-wine stains can also be covered with cosmetics. Lasers may be able to destroy the capillaries without significant damage to the overlying skin. Lasers and other light sources may therefore be able to reduce the redness of stains, although there is not enough evidence to recommend one form over another. For most people in trials of pulsed dye laser, more than 25% of the redness was reduced by laser after one to three treatments. Adverse effects were rare in these trials, although some people had changes to the color of the skin, especially Chinese people with darker skin. There can be pain, crusting, and blistering in the two weeks after treatment. The trials only followed people for six months, so long-term outcomes are not known. Up to 10 treatments may be necessary for improvement, but complete removal may not result. The use of topical rapamycin as an adjunct to pulsed dye laser may improve results.Marques L, Nunez-Cordoba JM, Aguado L, et al. Topical rapamycin combined with pulsed dye laser in the treatment of capillary vascular malformations in Sturge-Weber syndrome: phase II, randomized double-blind, intraindividual placebo controlled trial. JAAD 2015. Treatment is generally given before one year of age. However, as it is recommended to be performed under anesthesia (15 minutes) on small children, it is not always possible to get frequent treatments. For example in Finland a child gets treated 2-3 times per year, resulting in a target of \\"being ready before school age\\" (7 years). After the laser treatment the skin is filled with black marks, the size of a pen. This is due to the laser instrument's size; the black marks disappear within 1‚Äì3 weeks. The treated area can be sore and swollen for a couple of days. Prognosis In the absence of successful treatment, hypertrophy (increased tissue mass) of the stains may cause problems later in life, such as loss of function (especially if the stain is near the eye or mouth), bleeding, and increasing disfigurement. Lesions on or near the eyelid can be associated with glaucoma. If the port-wine stain is on the face or other highly visible part of the body, its presence can also cause emotional and social problems for the affected person.

For instance, it can guide electrons emitted from a sample to an electron analyzer, analogous to the way an optical lens assists in the transport of light in an optical instrument. Systems of electrostatic lenses can be designed in the same way as optical lenses, so electrostatic lenses easily magnify or converge the electron trajectories. An electrostatic lens can also be used to focus an ion beam, for example to make a microbeam for irradiating individual cells. Cylinder lens Cylinder lenses in a cathode ray tube electron gun A cylinder lens consists of several cylinders whose sides are thin walls. Each cylinder lines up parallel to the optical axis into which electrons enter. There are small gaps put between the cylinders. When each cylinder has a different voltage, the gap between the cylinders works as a lens. The magnification is able to be changed by choosing different voltage combinations. Although the magnification of two cylinder lenses can be changed, the focal point is also changed by this operation. Three cylinder lenses achieve the change of the magnification while holding the object and image positions because there are two gaps that work as lenses. Although the voltages have to change depending on the electron kinetic energy, the voltage ratio is kept constant when the optical parameters are not changed. While a charged particle is in an electric field force acts upon it. The faster the particle the smaller the accumulated impulse. For a collimated beam the focal length is given as the initial impulse divided by the accumulated (perpendicular) impulse by the lens. This makes the focal length of a single lens a function of the second order of the speed of the charged particle. Single lenses as known from photonics are not easily available for electrons. The cylinder lens consists of defocusing lens, a focusing lens and a second defocusing lens, with the sum of their refractive powers being zero. But because there is some distance between the lenses, the electron makes three turns and hits the focusing lens at a position farther away from the axis and so travels through a field with greater strength. This indirectness leads to the fact that the resulting refractive power is the square of the refractive power of a single lens. Einzel lens Path of ions in an einzel lens. An einzel lens is an electrostatic lens that focuses without changing the energy of the beam. It consists of three or more sets of cylindrical or rectangular tubes in series along an axis. Quadrupole lens The quadrupole lens consists of two single quadrupoles turned 90¬∞ with respect to each other. Let z be the optical axis then one can deduce separately for the x and the y axis that the refractive power is again the square of the refractive power of a single lens. A magnetic quadrupole works very similar to an electric quadrupole, however the Lorentz force increases with the velocity of the charged particle. In spirit of a Wien filter, a combined magnetic, electric quadrupole is achromatic around a given velocity. Bohr and Pauli claim that this lens leads to aberration when applied to ions with spin (in the sense of chromatic aberration), but not when applied to electrons which also have a spin. See Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment. Magnetic lens A magnetic field can also be used to focus charged particles. The Lorentz force acting on the electron is perpendicular to both the direction of motion and to the direction of the magnetic field (vxB). A homogeneous field deflects charged particles, but does not focus them. The simplest magnetic lens is a donut-shaped coil through which the beam passes, preferably along the axis of the coil. To generate the magnetic field, an electric current is passed through the coil. The magnetic field is strongest in the plane of the coil and gets weaker moving away from it. In the plane of the coil, the field gets stronger as we move away from the axis. Thus, a charged particle further from the axis experiences a stronger Lorentz force than a particle closer to the axis (assuming that they have the same velocity). This gives rise to the focusing action. Unlike the paths in an electrostatic lens, the paths in a magnetic lens contain a spiraling component, i.e. the charged particles spiral around the optical axis. As a consequence, the image formed by a magnetic lens is rotated relative to the object. This rotation is absent for an electrostatic lens. The spatial extent of the magnetic field can be controlled by using an iron (or other magnetically soft material) magnetic circuit. This makes it possible to design and build more compact magnetic lenses with well defined optical properties. The vast majority of electron microscopes in use today use magnetic lenses due to their superior imaging properties and the absence of the high voltages that are required for electrostatic lenses. Multipole lenses Multipoles beyond the quadrupole can correct for spherical aberration and in particle accelerators the dipole bending magnets are really composed of a large number of elements with different superpositions of multipoles. Usually the dependency is given for the kinetic energy itself depending on the power of the velocity. So for an electrostatic lens the focal length varies with the second power of the kinetic energy, while for a magnetostatic lens the focal length varies proportional to the kinetic energy. And a combined quadrupole can be achromatic around a given energy. If a distribution of particles with different kinetic energies is accelerated by a longitudinal electric field, the relative energy spread is reduced leading to less chromatic error. An example of this is in the electron microscope. Electron spectroscopy The recent development of electron spectroscopy makes it possible to reveal the electronic structures of molecules. Although this is mainly accomplished by electron analysers, electrostatic lenses also play a significant role in the development of electron spectroscopy. Since electron spectroscopy detects several physical phenomena from the electrons emitted from samples, it is necessary to transport the electrons to the electron analyser. Electrostatic lenses satisfy the general properties of lenses. See also *SIMION *Ion funnel References Further reading * E. Harting, F.H. Read, Electrostatic Lenses, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1976.

The Kahn brothers were also members of Nations by the River (2003‚Äì04). Gelbison released two studio albums, 1704 (7 April 2003) and See the World (8 November 2004), and disbanded in 2007.  History  Gelbison were formed in 2000 in Sydney by Pete Farley on bass guitar, horns and backing vocals; Dave Galafassi on drums; Edo Kahn on vocals and guitar; and his brother, Nadav Kahn, on vocals, harp and keyboards. Their first gig was at the Hollywood Hotel, Surry Hills attended by Ian Ball (Gomez); Nadav recalled, \\"We did meet [Ball] before [Gelbison formally] started. Edo and I met him in Bondi on a night out when [Gomez] were on their second tour in Australia and we connected on one very drunken night. Everyone ended up at my place, jamming until about six in the morning. So there was a musical and human connection. We somehow maintained contact.\\" The band's debut album, 1704, produced by Ball, was released on 7 April 2003 via Virgin Records and EMI Music Group Australia. It peaked at No. 20 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums Chart. Greg Lawrence of Worldwide Home of Australasian Music and More Online (WHAMMO) felt it was \\"a work of understated genius. Having Ian Ball from Gomez co-producing certainly helps but the compositions, the arrangements and the sentiment communicated throughout Gelbison‚Äôs debut LP is virtually faultless and much more than clever guidance from an established artist/producer.\\" Tim Cashmere of Undercover opined that \\"imagine if the out there factor could be multiplied by a thousand or so. That is one hell of a mellow album you've got there and local Sydney outfit Gelbison's major label debut is it.\\" Ahead of the album they issued their debut single, \\"Metal Detector\\" (October 2002), which Lawrence noticed \\"made an impact on radio regardless of dynamic, manic riffing that seemed to challenge the listener.\\" Cashmere described it as one of the album's \\"moments when the group gathered up the energy to head down to 7-11 and instead channeled it into tracks like 'Metal Detector'.\\" The following single, \\"Homelands\\" (February 2003), shows \\"a gentle flow but still contains imaginative garnishes and experimental textures.\\" A third single, \\"Good God\\", followed the album in May. Farley described that track, \\"I didn‚Äôt write the lyrics for that one but, for me, I get a sense of hope in that song, hoping for something that you haven‚Äôt got but you long for. I think there‚Äôs a real sense of longing in that song.\\" Galafassi had married Australian actress-singer, Toni Collette, in January that year. Collette directed the music video for \\"Good God\\". Early in 2003 Gelbison were touring in support of the Sleepy Jackson, when Edo Kahn and Luke Steele (of the Sleepy Jackson) started jamming together one evening: they decided to create a side project, Nations by the River as an alt-country band. The pair were soon joined by Nadav and later by Ohad Rein; they issued their debut album, Holes in the Valley, in June 2004. Gelbison's second album, See the World, was released on 8 November 2004, Ball returned for production duties, along with Ben Frost and Gelbison. Galafassi had left the group, while the remaining trio had started song writing in \\"a shack in Jarvis bay for [a] month writing period. In this time we compiled all our existing songs and wrote new songs and tried to decide on the best direction to take the record.\\" They used Hamish Stewart to provide drums for about 30 demo versions. Frost used ProTools \\"and started hacking at the beats sometimes speeding them up/slowing them down where we felt appropriate and re-appropriating fills and hits amongst the songs.\\" Ball \\"helped rework the song arrangements and structure and we tried to finish up all the tunes over the next three weeks in the studio. In this time we got in seven other drummers, as the need arose.\\" The album featured a number artists, Ball, Rein, Steel and Ben Lee. It peaked at No. 10 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums Chart. A number of tracks, including, \\"All the Rage\\" and \\"Holy\\", received significant rotation on Triple J. In the first week of December, Australian journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, declared See the World to be his Feature Album of the Week, \\"the voice of John Lennon's solo work, the gentle pop power of the Go-Betweens and the beautifully crafted sonic attack of Radiohead and Gomez rolled into one. This is an incredibly accomplished and confident piece of work. Song after song is a gem. Don't let anyone tell you that people don't write good songs anymore.\\" By January 2006 Farley and Galafassi were members of Toni Collette & the Finish, a pop music group. The remaining Gelbison members severed ties with EMI in 2006 and worked on their third album towards the end of that year with J Walker aka Machine Translations as producer. After recording they returned to the studio and recorded a new range of songs with producer, Tony Buchen. Edo and Nadav Kahn decided to disband Gelbison and provided new material as the Kahn Brothers, with their debut album, Love Melts Fear, released in April 2007 through Shakti/Interia Records.

It is a concept album focusing on the existence of God and humankind. Along with the band it features a nine-part orchestra, The Orchestra of Eternity, which features prominently throughout the album. This is the last album to feature Kristoffer Gildenl√∂w on bass. The album is the first Pain of Salvation album to be divided into more than three chapters. The band performed it live as a rock opera. It was released as \\"BE\\" (Original Stage Production). Outline BE attempts to explore the many facets of human existence. It begins with the narration of Animae, someone or something who/that has existed for as long as he/she/it can remember and contemplates the nature of his/her/its existence and then begins a journey of understanding with the words: \\"I will call myself GOD and I will spend the rest of forever trying to figure out who I am\\".Full Animae Transcript (Partially included on album) The story continues from there. The characters that appear and disappear throughout the story are as follows: *Animae: Animae is the album's representation of God, or a Godhead. *Nauticus: Nauticus is the name of a fictional space probe that is, according to the album, the most intelligent space probe ever to be created. In reference to the marine 'neighborhood', Nauticus 'drifts' throughout space, searching for answers to save Earth from itself. *Imago: Imago is the image of humanity in its most natural form. Combined, Imago is the reflection of Animae. *Dea Pecuniae: Dea Pecuniae can be seen as a feminine version of Mr. Money, and the Eve of humanity's dark side. In a way, she represents sin. *Mr. Money: Mr. Money is the main character of the story; a man with the most wealth on Earth, who spends most of it on cryogenics in order to fulfill his wish - to be frozen, and not to be awakened until he is made immortal. He represents the darker side of humanity, being the Adam for Dea Pecuniae. The sound and style are somewhat more varied than previous Pain of Salvation albums, but at the same time, calling upon those previous albums as influences. The album includes: narrative passages; a folk-like song; a gospel-prayer-like song; a church-hymn-like song; progressive metal songs; a classical piano/strings piece; a conversation with a radio in the background; news readings; and even a song that would not be out of place in a Broadway musical. Another song consists entirely of voice messages to be left on \\"God's answering machine\\". To approach this song, the band asks the subscribers of their newsletter to call a certain phone number and say what ever they would want to say to God. In writing \\"BE\\", Daniel Gildenl√∂w used many resources for information, insights and inspiration. These can be viewed at the \\"BE\\" home page, and are intended as \\"points of departure\\" for listeners to continue their \\"own journey through \\"BE\\" \\". Track listing and song title meanings The Latin errors are on purpose on behalf of Daniel. In a letter to a fan, which was posted on the Remedy Lane forum, he wrote: The rough translations for the song titles are: Prologue :01. _Animae Partus_ (\\"I Am\\") - A God Is Born (\\"I Am\\") 1:48 _\\"BE\\" (CHINASSIAH)_ I Animae Partus :All in the Image of :02. _Deus Nova_ \\\\- New God. Note that 'Deus' is masculine and 'Nova' is feminine, so it should have been either 'Deus Novus' (masculine) or 'Dea Nova' (feminine) if it were to be grammatically correct. However, this is intentional. 3:18 :03. _Imago (Homines Partus)_ \\\\- Imago (Man Is Born) 5:11 :04. _Pluvius Aestivus_ \\\\- Summer Rain 5:00 ::Of Summer Rain (Homines Fabula Initium) - Of Summer Rain (The Story of Man Begins) As is evident by the list to the left, the track listing and structure of the album are very detailed and confusing. This actual album image describing the album may help to understand it. II Machinassiah - See above. :Of Gods & Slaves :05. _Lilium Cruentus_ (Deus Nova) - Blood Stained Lily (New God). Note that it should have been 'Lilium Cruentum' if it were to be grammatically correct. 5:28 ::On the Loss of Innocence :06. _Nauticus_ (Drifting) - Nauticus (Drifting). Note that 'Nauticus' is Latin for Sailor, which directly applies to Nauticus' role in the concept. 4:58 :07. _Dea Pecuniae_ \\\\- Goddess of Money 10:09 ::I Mr. Money ::II Permanere ::III I Raise My Glass III Machinageddon - See above. :Nemo Idoneus Aderat Qui Responderet :08. _Vocari Dei_ \\\\- Messages to God 3:50 ::Sordes Aetas - Mess Age :09. _Diffidentia_ (Breaching the Core) - Mistrust (Breaching The Core) 7:26 ::Exitus - Drifting II :10. _Nihil Morari_ \\\\- Nothing Remains :: (Homines Fabula Finis) - The Story of Man Comes To An End 6:21 IV Machinauticus - See above. :Of the Ones With no Hope :11. _Latericius Valete_ \\\\- If You Are Strong, Be Strong 2:27 :12. _Omni_ \\\\- Everything 2:37 ::Permanere? :13. _Iter Impius_ \\\\- Wicked Path 6:21 ::Martius, son of Mars ::Obitus Diutinus :14. _Martius/Nauticus II_ \\\\- Martius/Nauticus II 6:41 V Deus Nova Mobile :...and a God is Born_ :15. _Animae Partus II_ 4:08 Concept, research, original stories, lyrics, narrations and texts by Daniel Gildenl√∂w.

Born near Peterborough, Canada West (now Ontario), Mackenzie became a teacher and politician before entering business as the owner of a sawmill and gristmill in Kirkfield, Ontario. He entered the railway business as a contractor under civil engineer James Ross, working on projects in Ontario, British Columbia, Maine, and the North-West Territories (present-day Saskatchewan and Alberta) between 1874 and 1891. In partnership with his mentor James Ross, Mackenzie became owner of the Toronto Street Railway (precursor to the Toronto Transit Commission) in 1891 and in 1899, helped found the precursor to Brazilian Traction, for which he was the first chairman. In 1895, together with Donald Mann, Mackenzie began to purchase or build rail lines in the Canadian prairies, which would form the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), a company that would stretch from Vancouver Island to Cape Breton Island and form Canada's second transcontinental railway system. He started Pat Burns' career by giving him a series of contracts for provisioning food for the railway contract. Burns would go on to build one of the World's largest meat empires. Mackenzie and Mann were knighted in 1911 for their efforts in the railway industry, but personal and company financial difficulties led to the bankruptcy of the CNoR. The system was nationalized by the federal government on September 6, 1918, and subsequently became part of the Canadian National Railway. Mackenzie died in Toronto, Ontario. He was inducted into Ottawa's Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002 along with partner Mann.

All of the music was composed by Malmsteen, though his compositions were scored by his friend and fellow musician David Rosenthal. The music is conducted by Yoel Levi, and performed by the Czech Philharmonic. Malmsteen has been keen to emphasize that unlike other collaborations between rock musicians and classical orchestras (such as Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra), which feature a rock group playing with orchestral accompaniment, this is orchestral music which happens to have an electric guitar as its solo instrument.

It lies approximately by road from Kainantu in the Aiyura Valley. The population consists of a variety of paid staff and volunteer staff who live nearby. The centre was established in 1957. The current population is approximately 600. It is at an elevation of approx. 5200 feet above sea level. History Medical clinic The 99-year lease for the at Ukarumpa was signed by Dick Pittman, accompanied by founding Director, Dr. James C. (\\"Jim\\") Dean for the Summer Institute of Linguistics on 4 October 1956. Jim Dean was the founding Director of the Summer Institute of Linguistics in the (then) United Nations mandated Australian Trust Territory of New Guinea and remained as Director until he was reassigned to establish the S.I.L. operations in India in the mid-1960s. The had been the Peacock Plantation, a failed commercial venture. Before that, however, it was a plot of land that was used as the tribal war lands of the nearby tribes (and traditional enemies), the Gadsup and Tairora. Because the land was vacant in the mid-1950s, and only a portion of it, near the Bae'e river, was suitable for gardens, the Australian administrators offered it as one of several potential sites for the SIL base of operations. Originally the land was open kunai (a type of waist-high grass with sharp- edged leaves) with few trees and no development. The members built homes and planted trees which continue to attract bird life. All of the buildings and roads were built by mission volunteers with financial donations from churches and individuals in their home countries. The function of Ukarumpa is to serve as an operations base for translators, linguists, literacy specialists, teachers and other professionals, who are mainly volunteer workers with SIL. SIL International is an organization that places a strong emphasis on linguistic research and Bible translation. Geography Ukarumpa viewed from \\"Lone Tree Hill\\" Ukarumpa is located on the Bae River. The Bae originates upstream from Ukarumpa and runs through the Gadsup area on to Kainantu. It lies at an altitude of approximately . The climate is Equatorial Highland; there are cool days and nights, with daily afternoon rains between November and March. The flora are primarily evergreen trees (Pine, Eucalyptus, Casuarina); there are also coffee plantations nearby, and kunai grass-covered hills.

During the 1880s he worked as a contractor for the Canadian Pacific Railway under James Ross and Herbert Samuel Holt, building sections of rail across the prairies and through the Rocky Mountains. Partnering with William Mackenzie in 1886, Mann built railway lines in Western Canada, Maine, and Chile. They also went to China to pursue opportunities, but found the red tape there too great an obstacle to overcome. While there, he was challenged to a duel by a Russian count, who later withdrew when Mann advised him that he would choose to use the broadaxe, claiming it to be Canada's national weapon. By 1895, the effects of the CPR monopoly on freight rates in Western Canada, together with its refusal to build branch lines into the northern prairie, prompted Clifford Sifton to offer federal bond guarantees to any other enterprise that wished to construct railways there. Mackenzie and Mann took up the offer, and began the process of purchasing and building such lines. They would later be consolidated in 1898 to become the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), a line which would stretch from Vancouver Island, British Columbia to Montreal, with other unconnected lines as far east as Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, which would form Canada's second transcontinental railway system. The CNoR would be the first railway to reach Edmonton, Alberta, and the full line was completed in 1915, upon the driving of the last spike in Basque, British Columbia. In recognition of their contributions to the development of Canada's railways, both Mann and Mackenzie were knighted in 1911. Financial difficulties eventually resulted in the insolvency of the CNoR. It was nationalized by the federal government on September 6, 1918,as a consequence of arbitration under and became the Canadian National Railway. Mann developed other business opportunities on his own, which included coal mines and a related railway in Inverness County, Nova Scotia, the Winnipeg Street Railway, and multiple public utilities in Monterrey, Mexico. Mann turned to oil drilling. He leased land in the Township of Vaughan, near the village of Concord, and sank a well in November 1922. In the spring of 1928, instead of oil, he found mineral water. Under the name Ontario Mineral Waters Ltd. he bottled and sold it as a health tonic named \\"Raysol Radium Water\\" effective against a variety of ailments including diabetes, angina, tuberculosis and rheumatism. $1 a bottle or $3 a gallon. The venture failed ostensibly because the water was very salty.Raysol: radium in solution, Ontario Mineral Waters, Ltd., Northern Ontario Building, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. [Oct. 24, 1929] Mann died in 1934 at the age of 81, and was buried at Fairview Cemetery in Acton. Legacy In 1969, a park was named for Sir Donald Mann in Acton, Ontario, the land of which once formed part of the farm on which he grew up. It is adjacent to the CNR track, and not far away from the former right of way once occupied by the Toronto Suburban Railway controlled by Mackenzie and Mann. He, along with Mackenzie, was inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002. He is also known for the Mann Cup, the trophy awarded to the senior men's lacrosse champions of Canada. The cup is made of solid gold, and it was donated in 1910.

The Kharoti settled in Kharotabad in Quetta, British India (now Pakistan) around 1945. The Kharoti in Afghanistan and have an estimated population of about 2.5 million, making them one of the largest tribes in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Kharoti own significant territory throughout eastern and southeastern Afghanistan. Many Kharoti are business owners. There are large Kharoti populations in the Paktika districts of Urgun, Barmal, Sar Hawza, Zarghun Shahr, Omna, Surobi, Ghazni, Zabul, Paktia, Khost, Logar, Wardak, Kabul, Nangarhar, Helmand and Gomal.Paktika Personalities: An Examination of the Tribes and the Significant People of a Traditional Pashtun Province - Timothy S. Timmons and Rashid Hassanpoor (2007) The Kharoti also have a significant presence in the Pakistani province of Balochistan, as well as the port city of Karachi in southern Pakistan. Sher Khan Bandar, Afghanistan's largest harbour city, which is located near Tajikistan's border, is named after Sher Khan Nashir, Khan of the Kharoti. Around 2000 Kharoti families also live in the Iranian cities of Zahedan and Karimabad. They typically speak Persian and Balochi languages. In Pakistan, Kharoti live in the Chaghi District of Balochistan and typically speak in the Balochi tongue. They also live in Noushki, Balochistan. The Kharoti also live in Chamalang near Loralai and call themselves Kharotani, but nevertheless speak Balochi. The Kharoti tribe has a presence in the KPK province in Dera Ismail Khan and Lakki Marwat village Adamzai. There are Kharoti in Punjab on Mianwali Road. In Rawalpindi (Punjab) there are approximately 300 families of Kharoti origin. Significance As Pashtuns of the Ghilji confederacy, the heyday of the Kharotis was during the peak of the khans of the Nasher-Nashir family. With the rise of the rival Durrani confederacy in the 18th century, the Kharoti lost their leading role in Afghan politics but remained strong in rural Afghan regions. However, they often view themselves as the \\"true Pashtuns\\" and, being Ghilji, as the rightful leaders of Afghanistan.

Tierney with Daniel Maliniak (August 2005). Teaching and Research Practices, Views on the Discipline, and Policy Attitudes of International Relations Faculty at U.S. Colleges and Universities He was a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War. Waltz was one of the original founders of neorealism, or structural realism, in international relations theory and later became associated with the school of defensive neorealism. Waltz's theories have been extensively debated within the field of international relations. In 1981, Waltz published a monograph arguing that in some cases the proliferation of nuclear weapons could increase the probability of international peace.n.b. The monograph was The Spread of Nuclear Weapons. Waltz developed this theory in later publications, including one that argued peace in the Middle East could be secured if Iran were to acquire nuclear capability. Leslie H. Gelb has considered Waltz one of the \\"giants\\" who helped define the field of international relations as an academic discipline. Columbia University colleague Robert Jervis has said of Waltz, \\"Almost everything he has written challenges the consensus that prevailed at the time\\" and \\"Even when you disagree, he moves your thinking ahead.\\" Early life, education, and military service Waltz was born on June 8, 1924, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He grew up and attended high school there. He then attended Oberlin College, where he started out majoring in mathematics. That was interrupted to serve in the Army of the United States from 1944‚Äì46 during World War II, when he rose in rank from private to first lieutenant. He graduated from Oberlin with an A.B. degree in 1948, having switched his major to economics. He was a Phi Beta Kappa and also named an Amos Miller Scholar. In 1949, he married Helen Elizabeth Lindsley, known as \\"Huddie\\". They had three children together. After attending Columbia University to obtain an upper graduate degree in economics, he switched to political science because political philosophy was more interesting to him. He received his M.A. degree from there in 1950. He was an instructor at Oberlin for a while in 1950. A member of the US Army Reserve, he was called upon to serve again during the Korean War, which he did during 1951‚Äì52 as a first lieutenant. Returning to Columbia, he obtained his Ph.D. under William T. R. Fox in 1954. Academic career Waltz became a lecturer, then assistant professor, at Columbia during 1953 to 1957. He became one of the early group of scholars at Columbia's Institute of War and Peace Studies, acting as a research assistant from 1952 to 1954 and a research associate beginning in 1954. Later saying that he and his wife had been unsettled by the prospect of raising small children in New York City, Waltz left Columbia for Swarthmore College, where he was an assistant professor and then a professor, from 1957 to 1966. He then moved on to Brandeis University for a stint from 1966 to 1971, the last four years of which he held the Adlai E. Stevenson Professor of International Politics chair. In 1971, Waltz switched coasts and joined University of California, Berkeley, where he was appointed the Ford Professor of Political Science and stayed for over two decades. During this time, Waltz held a number of additional research positions. He was affiliated with the Institute of War and Peace Studies until 1964. He was a fellow of Columbia University in Political Theory and International Relations from 1959 to 1960 in London. He was a research associate at Center for International Affairs at Harvard University in 1963 to 1964, 1968, 1969, and 1972. He held a National Science Foundation grant from 1968 to 1971 to develop a theory of international politics. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for 1976 to 1977 and a fellow at the Institute for the Study of World Politics in 1977. He was a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in 1979‚Äì1980. He then was a research associate with the Department of War Studies, King's College London. Waltz taught at Peking University for two months in 1982 and later taught at Fudan University as well. He lectured at a number of institutions in the US, including the United States Air Force Academy, the National War College, the Army War College, and the Naval War College. Similarly, he lectured at many other institutions around the world, including the London School of Economics, the Australian National University, and the University of Bologna. Waltz retired from his position at Berkeley and returned to Columbia University in 1997. There, he became an adjunct professor as well as a senior research scholar at the Institute of War and Peace Studies. Waltz served as Secretary of the American Political Science Association in 1966 to 1967 and then as its president in 1987 to 1988. He was President of the New England Section of the International Studies Association in 1966 to 1967. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served stints on the boards of editors of several scholarly journals. Levels of analysis Waltz's initial contribution to the field of international relations was his 1959 book, Man, the State, and War, which was based upon his dissertation, which classified theories of the causes of war into three categories, or levels of analysis. Waltz refers to these levels of analysis as \\"images,\\" and uses the writings of one or more classic political philosophers to outline the major points of each image. Each image is given two chapters: the first mainly uses the classical philosopher's writings to describe what that image says about the cause of war; the second usually consists of Waltz analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of that image. Waltz's wife was essential in contributing the research that became the basis for Man, the State, and War. The first image argues that wars are often caused by the nature of particular statesmen and political leaders such as state leaders, like Napoleon, or by human nature more generally. That is basically consistent with Classical Realism, which dominated the International Relations discipline at the time of Man, the State, and War, but Waltz would contest it more fully in his next book, Theory of International Politics. Theories of war that fall under the rubric of Waltz's second image contend that wars are caused by the domestic makeup of states. A prime example that Waltz refers to is Lenin's theory of imperialism, which posits that the main cause of war is rooted in the need for capitalist states to continue opening up new markets in order to perpetuate their economic system at home. A more familiar example in the Western world today is the notion that non-democratic states, because of their internal composition, start wars. Waltz next assesses the first two images as being less influential in general than the third image, yet ultimately necessary in understanding the causes of war. The third image posits that the cause of war is found at the systemic level; the anarchic structure of the international system is the root cause of war. In this context, \\"anarchy\\" is not defined as a condition of chaos or disorder but rather one in which there is no sovereign body that governs the interactions between autonomous nation-states. Put differently, unlike in domestic society where citizens can theoretically rely on law enforcement agencies to protect their persons and property, if a state is invaded and calls \\"9-1-1\\" it cannot be sure anyone will answer. Similarly, whereas when two citizens have a dispute they can appeal to the courts to render a verdict and, more importantly, the law enforcement agencies to enforce the court's ruling, there is no body above nation-states that is capable of: establishing rules or laws for all the states, deciding how these apply in specific cases, and compelling the states to honor the court's ruling. As a result, if an issue at stake is important enough to a state, it can achieve a satisfactory outcome only by using its power to impose its will on another state(s). The realization that, at any point in time any state can resort to armed force, forces each state always be prepared for that contingency. These themes are fleshed out more fully in Theory of International Politics which, as the title suggests, lays out a theory for international politics as a whole rather than the narrower focus on what causes war. Neorealism Waltz's key contribution to the realm of political science is in the creation of neorealism (or structural realism, as he calls it), a theory of International Relations which posits that the interaction of sovereign states can be explained by the pressures exerted on them by the anarchic structure of the international system, which limits and constrains their choices. Neorealism thus aims to explain recurring patterns in international relations, such as why relations between Sparta and Athens resembled those between the US and the Soviet Union in some important ways. Waltz emphasizes repeatedly in this book and elsewhere that he is not creating a theory of foreign policy, which aims to explain the behavior or actions of a particular state at a specific time or throughout a period. For Waltz, neorealism is divided into two branches, defensive and offensive neorealism. Although both branches agree that the structure of the system is what causes states to compete for power, Defensive realism posits that most states seek a status quo and limit themselves to concentrate on maintaining the balance of power. Revisionist states are said to be the only states that seek to alter the balance. Offensive neorealism, in contrast to Waltz, asserts that nations seek local hegemony over neighboring states to assert authority in local relations with rival states. Waltz argues that contemporary geopolitics exists in a state of international affairs comparable to that of perpetual international anarchy. Waltz distinguishes the anarchy of the international environment from the order of the domestic one. In the domestic realm, all actors may appeal to, and be compelled by, a central authority, 'the state' or 'the government', but in the international realm, no such source of order exists. The anarchy of international politics (its lack of a central enforcer) means that states must act in a way that ensures their security above all, or else risk falling behind. He wrote that is a fundamental fact of political life faced by democracies and dictatorships alike: except in rare cases, they cannot count on the good will of others to help them, so they must always be ready to fend for themselves. Waltz's usage of the term anarchy led to a fundamental discursive transformation in international relations, as IR scholars wrestled with Waltz's ideas. A 2015 study by Jack Donnelly found that the term \\"anarchy\\" occurred on average 6.9 times in IR books prior to 1979 but 35.5 times in IR books after 1979. Like most neorealists, Waltz accepts that globalization is posing new challenges to states, but he does not believe states are being replaced because no other non-state actor can equal the capabilities of the state. Waltz has suggested that globalization is a fad of the 1990s and, if anything, the role of the state has expanded its functions in response to global transformations. Neorealism was Waltz's response to what he saw as the deficiencies of classical realism. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, neorealism and realism have a number of fundamental differences. The main distinction between the two theories is that classical realism puts human nature, or the urge to dominate, at the center of its explanation for war, while neorealism stakes a reduced claim on human nature and argues instead that the pressures of anarchy tend to shape outcomes more directly than the human nature of statesmen and diplomats or domestic governmental preferences. Waltz's theory, as he explicitly makes clear in Theory of International Politics, is not a theory of foreign policy and does not attempt to predict specific state actions, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union.Dall'Agnol, Augusto C. Vol. 7, No. 3 (2018), pp. 494‚Äì515, for further discussions that Waltz's main predictions still applies in the post- Cold War era. The theory explains only general principles of behavior that govern relations between states in an anarchic international system, rather than specific actions. The recurring principles of behavior include balancing of power (the theory was refined by Stephen Walt, modifying the \\"balance of power\\" concept to \\"balance of threat\\"), entering into individually competitive arms races, and exercising restraint in proportion to relative power. In Theory of International Politics (1979:6) Waltz suggests that explanation rather than prediction is expected from a good social science theory, since social scientists cannot run controlled experiments that give the natural sciences so much predictive power.

He received his D.Phil. at the University of Oxford in 1927.  Early life  Baker was the youngest of five children born to Rear Admiral Julian Alleyne Baker and his wife Geraldine Eugenie (nee Alison). He was a grandson of General Sir Archibald Alison and among the papers collected in Baker's name at the Bodleian Library are volumes of correspondence and other material related to Alison's military service during the Indian Mutiny, Ashanti Campaign, and Egyptian Campaign of 1882. Born in Woodbridge, Baker grew up in a country home near Bromyard. At age ten, he was sent to Boxgrove School, near Guildford. Due to World War I, his schooling there was cut short and he joined the Bournemouth School of Flying at age sixteen. Though he achieved a pilot's certificate, he was excluded from the Royal Flying Corps due to inadequate eyesight and thereafter joined the Oxford University Officers' Training Corps. Upon war's end, Baker entered Oxford's New College, where he studied zoology. Among the small staff of the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy was Dr. (later Sir) Julian Huxley, of whom Baker would write a biographical memoir many years later. Other students in the department during Baker's time included Charles Elton, E. B. Ford, Alister Hardy and Carlos Blacker. Baker became the captain of New College's rowing team and completed his B.A. with first class honours in 1922, partially on the basis of his microscopical investigation of spermatogenesis in crickets.  Expeditions  Baker participated in several overseas research expeditions following his undergraduate work. An anthropological and zoological mission headed by Professor T. T. Barnard in 1922 provided the first of three visits to the New Hebrides Islands, where Baker turned his attention to the influence of a relatively non-seasonal climate on the breeding seasons and sexual activity of animals. He also became interested in the hermaphroditic pigs bred by the native people for use in rituals of initiation and, later, in comparing them with the intersex pigs of Britain. Examination of the anatomical and histological characteristics of these animals, in conjunction with research into factors of sex determination and development of sexual organs, led to his book Sex in man and animals (1926). In 1927, Baker returned to the New Hebrides for a year. On this trip, his study of the native population and interest in reproduction became focused on questions of human population control, about the growth of which he and many others had become concerned. His research in this area would eleven years later issue in the development of the contraceptive spermicide Volpar and, for this work, he would in 1958 receive the Oliver Bird Medal from the Family Planning Association. Interestingly, Baker's great-grandfather, Sir Archibald Alison, had in 1840 published a book titled The principles of population. In 1933, under the auspices of the Oxford University Exploration Club founded by his schoolmate Charles Elton, Baker organized and led the Oxford Expedition to the New Hebrides, the primary focus of which was to investigate the influence of environmental factors on the breeding seasons of rainforest fauna. Additional purposes included specimen collection and surveying. The company included his wife Inezita and sister Geraldine - who had collaborated with him on previous research, ornithologist Thom Harrisson, zoologist and surveyor Terence Bird, and naturalist A. J. Marshall. One of the expedition's accomplishments was the first ascent and mapping of Mount Tabwemasana, the highest peak in the New Hebrides. The resultant map was used by the U.S. Army during their World War II occupation of the islands. Work The most widely received of his works was Race (1974). Uncharacteristically for the time, Baker used the traditional categories of physical anthropology and classified human populations in terms of race. Baker rejected the methodological relativism that had characterized anthropology since the days of Franz Boas, instead going back to earlier ideas of hereditarianism and cultural evolution. The book received mixed reviews. In Race, Baker used a restrictive sense of the term \\"civilization\\", giving 23 criteria by which civilizations might be identified. Based on these criteria, Baker declared that Mesoamerican societies such as those of the Aztecs and Maya were not civilizations, and that no indigenous civilizations ever arose in Africa. He enumerated five civilizations sensu stricto and explored the relationship between the biological traits and the cultures of these five civilizations.Baker, John R. Race (Oxford University Press, 1974). In this book, Baker speculated that different human races evolved from different subspecies of apes (known as Polygenism). Baker claimed that \\"negrids\\" were less evolved, and also inferior, to races Baker described as civilized. Baker also claims that all black people have a \\"fetid smell\\". According to a 1974 review by A. O. Ladimeji in Race & Class, Baker misrepresents or misunderstands the history of the study of race. Per Ladimeji, \\"Most of Baker's biological data comes from the nineteenth century with no corroboration from recent research.\\" Ladimeji wrote that most of Baker's more outlandish claims had already been refuted by available studies at the time of publication. Together with Michael Polanyi, Baker founded the Society for Freedom in Science in 1940. In March, 1958 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

The leader and co-founder is Stephen Perkins, who first played drums for Jane's Addiction (1986‚Äì1991, plus later regroupings), and then for Porno for Pyros. He co-founded the group with Emit Bloch. The core members of the band are Nels Cline on guitar, Willie Waldman on trumpet and Mike Watt (Minutemen) on bass. Mike Watt also sings on some Banyan songs. Both Mike Watt and Nels Cline generally play only West Coast dates and at various times the band has had Rob Wasserman and Daniel Shulman who played with Garbage on bass and Clint Wagner on guitar fill in when they are unavailable. Saxophone players Steve Mackay and Herman Green, guitar player Calvin Newborn, Dave Aron on clarinet, and bass player J. D. Westmoreland have also joined the band during select live shows. Los Angeles artist Norton Wisdom paints on a wet-erase board while the band plays, and the imagery he creates interprets the music much in the same way that lyrics might. To see the band in more than one performance, you will see some images that recur and some that are new, since the songs are compositions whose structure remains the same while there is also a large amount of improvisation, in the jazz tradition. The first EP featured Money Mark as keyboardist labeled as the Freeway Keyboardist. The first album was engineered by the Dust Brothers at their studio and produced by Turin and Perkins. Notable guest appearances on the second album Anytime at All include Flea, John Frusciante (both from the Red Hot Chili Peppers), Martyn LeNoble (Perkins' former bandmate from Porno for Pyros), Rob Wasserman and Buckethead. It was produced by Dave Aron (Producer/Engineer/Mixer of Snoopdogg, Sublime and moe.) and Willie Waldman as the Blunt Brothers. For their third album Live At Perkins' Palace (named after the fact that it was recorded at Perkins' home studio, not after the live performance venue of the same name), the band reduced itself to a four-piece unit of Perkins, Watt, Cline, and Waldman. Steve Kimock sat-in with Banyan during their August 26, 2007 performance at the Riverview Music Festival in Chicago, IL. In liner notes and personal conversations, members of the band cite Igor Stravinsky and Miles Davis as influences.

Many Lepcha are also found in western and southwestern Bhutan, Tibet, Darjeeling, the Mechi Zone of eastern Nepal, and in the hills of West Bengal. The Lepcha people are composed of four main distinct communities: the Renj√≥ngm√∫ of Sikkim; the D√°ms√°ngm√∫ of Kalimpong, Kurseong, and Mirik; the  îil√°mm√∫ of Ilam District, Nepal; and the Prom√∫ of Samtse and Chukha in southwestern Bhutan.  Origins  A group of Lepcha shingle cutters at Darjeeling in the 1870s A group of Lepchas in Darjeeling (c. 1880) The word Lepcha (endonym Roang kup) is considered to be the anglicised version of the Nepalese word lepche meaning \\"vile speakers\\" or \\"inarticulate speech\\". This was at first a derogatory nickname but is no longer seen as negative. The origin of the Lepcha is unknown. They may have originated in Myanmar, Tibet or Mongolia but the Lepcha people themselves firmly believe that they did not migrate to the current location from anywhere and are indigenous to the region. They speak a Tibeto- Burman language which some classify as Himalayish. Based on this, some anthropologists suggest they emigrated directly from Tibet to the north, Japan or from Eastern Mongolia. Others suggest a more complex migration that started in southeast Tibet, a migration to Thailand, Burma, or Japan, then a navigation of the Ayeyarwady River and Chindwin rivers, a crossing of the Patkoi range coming back west, and finally entering ancient India (this supported by Austroasiatic languages substrata in their vocabularies). While migrating westward through India, they are surmised to have passed through southern Bhutan before reaching their final destination near Kanchenjunga. The Lepcha people themselves do not have any tradition of migration, and hence they conclude that they are autochthonous to the region, currently falling under the state of Sikkim, Darjeeling District of West Bengal, eastern Nepal and the southwestern parts of Bhutan. In the Mechi Zone, they form 7% of the population of Ilam District, 2% in Panchthar District, and 10% of the population in Taplejung District. In Sikkim as a whole they are considered to be around 15% of the population of the state. The Lepcha people were earlier ruled by Pano (King) Gaeboo Achyok. Pano Gaeboo Achyok was instrumental in uniting the Lepcha people and to honour him, the Lepcha people celebrate 20 December of every year as Pano Gaeboo Achyok celebrations day. Pano Gaeboo Achyok extended the Lepcha kingdom from Bhutan in the east to Ilam (Nepal) in the west and from Sikkim to the northern tips of present day Bangladesh.  Language  The Lepcha have their own language, also called Lepcha. It belongs to the Bodish‚ÄìHimalayish group of Tibeto-Burman languages. The Lepcha write their language in their own script, called R√≥ng or Lepcha script, which is derived from the Tibetan script. It was developed between the 17th and 18th centuries, possibly by a Lepcha scholar named Thik√∫ng Mensal√≥ng, during the reign of the third Chogyal (Tibetan king) of Sikkim. The world's largest collection of old Lepcha manuscripts is found with the Himalayan Languages Project in Leiden, Netherlands, with over 180 Lepcha books.  Clans  Lepchas are divided into many clans (Lepcha: putsho), each of which reveres its own sacred lake and mountain peak (Lepcha: d√¢ and c√∫) from which the clan derives its name. While most Lepcha can identify their own clan, Lepcha clan names can be quite formidable, and are often shortened for this reason. For example, NƒÅmchum√∫,A.R.Foning, Lepcha My Vanishing Tribe, Sterling Publishers, 1987, pp. 123-136 Sim√≠km√∫, and Fonyung Rums√≥ngm√∫ may be shortened to Namchu, Simik, and Foning, respectively. Some of the name of the clans are \\"Sada\\", \\"Barphungputso\\", \\"Rongong\\", \\"Karthakmu\\", \\"Sungutmu\\", \\"Phipon\\", \\"Brimu\\", etc.  Religion  Most Lepchas are Buddhist, a religion brought by the Bhutias from the north, although a large number of Lepchas have today adopted Christianity. Some Lepchas have not given up their shamanistic religion, which is known as Mun. In practice, rituals from Mun and Buddhism are frequently observed alongside one another among some Lepchas. For example, ancestral mountain peaks are regularly honoured in ceremonies called c√∫ rumf√°t. Many rituals involve local species. In Sikkim, Lepchas are known to use over 370 species of animals, fungi, and plants. According to the Nepal Census of 2001, out of the 3,660 Lepcha in Nepal, 88.80% were Buddhists and 7.62% were Hindus. Many Lepchas in the Hills of Sikkim, Darjeeling and Kalimpong are Christians.  Clothing  Photograph of a Lepcha c. 1900, wearing the traditional cone- shaped hat The traditional clothing for Lepcha women is the ankle-length dumbun, also called dumdy√°m or gƒÅdƒÅ (\\"female dress\\"). It is one large piece of smooth cotton or silk, usually of a solid color. When it is worn, it is folded over one shoulder, pinned at the other shoulder, and held in place by a waistband, or tago, over which excess material drapes. A contrasting long- sleeved blouse may be worn underneath. The traditional Lepcha clothing for men is the dumpr√° (\\"male dress\\"). It is a multicolored, hand-woven cloth pinned at one shoulder and held in place by a waistband, usually worn over a white shirt and trousers. Men wear a flat round cap called a thy√°ktuk, with stiff black velvet sides and a multicolored top topped by a knot. Rarely, the traditional cone-shaped bamboo and rattan hats are worn.  Dwellings  Traditionally, the Lepcha live in a local house called a li. A traditional home is made out of logs of wood and bamboo and rests around 4 to 5 feet (1.2m to 1.5m) above the ground on stilts. The wooden house with thatched roof is natural air conditioner and eco-friendly. It is interesting to note that the traditional Lepcha house has no nails used in the construction and it is seismic movement friendly since the weight of the house is rested over a large tablets of stones and not planted in the soil.  Subsistence  The Lepchas are mostly agriculturists. They grow oranges, rice, cardamoms, and other foods. = Cuisine = Lepcha cuisine is mild and not as spicy as Indian or Nepalese cuisine. Rice is the staple, while wheat, maize and buckwheat are also used. Fresh fruit and vegetables are used. Khuzom is a traditional Lepcha bread made from buck wheat, millet, and corn or wheat flour. Popular Lepcha dishes include Ponguzom (Rice, fish, vegetable grill), Su zom (Baked meat dish), Thukpa (Noodle, meat and vegetable stew) and Sorongbeetuluk (Rice and nettle porridge). An alcoholic beverage called Chi or Chhaang is fermented from Millet. Chi also has religious significance as it is given as offering to the Gods during religious ceremonies.  Arts, crafts, and music  The Lepchas are known for their unique weaving and basketry skills. The Lepcha have a rich tradition of dances, songs, and folktales. The popular Lepcha folk dances are Zo-Mal-Lok, Chu-Faat, Tendong Lo Rum Faat and Kinchum-Chu-Bomsa. Musical instruments used are Sanga (drum), Yangjey (string instrument), Cymbal, Yarka, Flute and Tungbuk. One popular instrument used by the Lepchas is a four-string lute that is played with a bow.  Marriage customs  The Lepcha are largely an endogamous community. The Lepcha trace their descent patrilineally. The marriage is negotiated between the families of the bride and the groom. If the marriage deal is settled, the lama will check the horoscopes of the boy and girl to schedule a favourable date for the wedding. Then the boy's maternal uncle, along with other relatives, approach the girl's maternal uncle with a khada, a ceremonial scarf, and one rupee, to gain the maternal uncle's formal consent. The wedding takes place at noon on the auspicious day. The groom and his entire family leave for the girl's house with some money and other gifts that are handed over to the bride's maternal uncle. Upon reaching the destination, the traditional Nyomchok ceremony takes place, and the bride's father arranges a feast for relatives and friends. This seals the wedding between the couple.

Linda S. Watts. Infobase Publishing, 2007. . p. 383. collected by Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen and J√∏rgen Moe in their Norske Folkeeventyr, first published between 1841 and 1844. It has an \\"eat-me-when-I'm-fatter\\" plot (Aarne-Thompson type 122E). The first version of the story in English appeared in George Webbe Dasent's translation of some of the Norske Folkeeventyr, published as Popular Tales from the Norse in 1859. The heroes of the tale are three male goats who need to outsmart a ravenous troll in order to cross the bridge to their feeding ground. Plot The story introduces three male goats, sometimes identified as a youngster, father and grandfather, but more often described as brothers. In other adaptations, there is a baby or child goat, mama goat and papa goat. \\"Gruff\\" was used as their family name in the earliest English translation, by Dasent; the original Norwegian version used the name \\"Bruse\\". In the story, there is almost no grass left for them to eat near where they live, so they must cross a river to get to \\"s√¶ter\\" (a meadow) or hillside on the other side of a stream in order to eat and fatten themselves up. To do so, however, they must first cross a bridge, under which lives a fearsome and hideous troll, who is so territorial that he eats anyone who tries to cross the bridge. The smallest billy goat is the first to cross and is stopped abruptly by the troll who threatens to \\"gobble him up!\\" However, the little goat convinces the troll to wait for his big brother to come across, because he is larger and would make for a more gratifying feast. The greedy troll agrees and lets the smallest goat cross. The medium-sized goat passes next. He is more cautious than his brother but is also stopped by the troll and given the same threat. The second billy goat is allowed to cross as well after he tells the troll to wait for the biggest billy goat because he is the largest of the three. The third billy goat gets on the bridge, but is also stopped by the hungry troll who threatens to devour him. However, the third billy goat challenges the troll and knocks him off the bridge with his horns. The troll falls into the stream and is carried away by the current. From then on the bridge is safe, and all three goats are able to go to the rich fields around the summer farm in the hills, and they all live happily ever after.

He was also one of the founding members of Stone, which was one of the first notable bands in the history of Finnish heavy metal. Biography Latvala was born in Helsinki. At the age of 15, he founded the band Stone together with Janne Joutsenniemi. The band's style was initially focused on a more traditional heavy metal, but they soon shifted to a faster and more aggressive sound, which was the key for them to receive mass recognition. In the year of 1991, the band was dissolved, with a discography of four studio albums, one live album and one compilation album. He is the main influence of many Finnish guitarists, especially Alexi Laiho (from Children of Bodom). After the breakup of Stone, he released an instrumental work with his brother, entitled Latvala bros. He then played with Dementia for around a year. In 1995 he joined Waltari after guitarist Sami Yli-Sirni√∂ left the band. They played together for six years before Latvala decided to quit the band. He joined Sinergy after vocalist Kimberly Goss moved from Sweden to Finland and had to reassemble the band, having assumed the role that previously belonged to Jesper Str√∂mblad (from In Flames). During the whole of his career, Latvala had many side projects and played as a guest musician in many bands, the most notable of the being: Warmen, Nomicon, Pornonorsu, Jailbreakers, Gloomy Grim, Amon Amarth, Children of Bodom, and Soulgrind. At times, he also composed movie soundtracks. When Alexander Kuoppala left Children of Bodom in 2003 in the middle of their world tour, the members of the band were forced to search for a new guitarist in the time span of one month, when their next show would happen. The new guitarist needed to be able to learn about twenty songs to be played live. Alexi Laiho allegedly tried to recruit Kai R. Nerg√•rd, of the Norwegian Heavy metal band Griffin, who declined. With little time left, Latvala contacted Laiho and asked him if Children of Bodom needed any help on the tour. Laiho agreed that he would be a session player because he was the only guitarist he deemed skilled enough to manage the feat of learning the songs with enough accuracy to replace Kuoppala, who had been playing with the band for 10 years. Latvala played the Moscow concert on 16 August successfully. Despite the initial announcement that he would be a session player only, he remained with the band and recorded the Trashed, Lost & Strungout EP. He continued playing with the band and also recorded the hit LP Are You Dead Yet?. Latvala played two guitar solos on the Children of Bodom album, \\"Are You Dead Yet?\\", despite the widely accepted notion that Laiho plays all solos on Bodom albums. When he joined Children of Bodom, Latvala made a deal with ESP Guitars, which already endorsed Laiho and Henkka Sepp√§l√§. Before that he used Jackson Guitars almost exclusively (Latvala could be seen wearing the infamous Jackson T-shirt that reads Get The Best, Fuck The Rest), and it is not unusual for him to use his old Jacksons live. There were rumors which said that he would switch sides with Jesper Str√∂mblad of the melodic death metal Band In Flames, but he denied it saying that he had never heard anything about it, and added \\"I said that I like Dark Tranquillity and In Flames. But somebody misunderstood me and wrote silly things in a metal magazine. So we are together with my lovely friend Alexi Laiho and the whole crew.\\" As of late May 2015, Latvala no longer is a member of Children of Bodom with the band having recorded the I Worship Chaos album as a four-piece, he was later replaced by Finnish Swede guitarist Daniel Freyberg of Naildown and Norther. According to Latvala he was fired from Children of Bodom just days before recording for the album was about to start. He later stated that he felt like he was \\"stabbed in the back\\" by his former band mates, while the band themselves said Latvala was not committed to the group, which included missing practices. Guitars On the Latvala Bros. Myspace page, it states that Latvala uses \\"metal plectrums.\\" Latvala plays his ESP custom Random Star on stage and in the studio, yet he still, on some occasions, uses his old Jackson RR's. These guitars have become highly famous among Finnish guitar players, and Latvala was instrumental in cementing Jackson Guitars as the best selling guitar brand in Finland. ESP guitars released in early 2008 an LTD Roope Latvala signature guitar. It features an alder, Star shaped body, a neck-through maple neck with an ebony fretboard, cross inlays and reversed headstock. It includes an Original Floyd Rose bridge, Grover Tuners, a single EMG HZ H-2 bridge pickup with a single volume control. His signature guitar is discontinued in North America as of 2011. ESP produces an ESP comprised Roope Latvala signature series in Japan.

Personal life  Von Kempelen was born in Pressburg, today's Bratislava (Slovakia), part of the Kingdom of Hungary within the Habsburg Empire, the last child of Engelbert Kempelen (1680‚Äì1761), and Anna Theresa Spindler. Contrary to some reports, he did not hold the title of \\"Ritter\\" or \\"Baron.\\" This misconception may stem from historical confusion with one of his older brothers, Johannes Nepomuk Joseph, who attained the rank of general within the Habsburg Empire, and who was granted the title Kempelen von P√°zm√°nd after purchasing a former Jesuit estate in P√°zm√°nd, a village south of Budapest. Von Kempelen studied law and philosophy in Pressburg, and attended the Academy in Gy≈ër, Vienna and Rome, but mathematics and physics also interested him. Besides German he spoke Hungarian, Latin, French, Italian, and later, some English and Romanian, which he learned during his travels in England and assignments in The Banat. He applied for his first position with the Habsburg Court in 1755 as a supernumary clerk in the Hungarian Court Chamber in Pozsony. Later he became a secretary (1757), a Councillor of the Court Chamber (1764), Director of Salt Mining (1765), Second Commissioner of the Constitutional Commission for the Region of Banat (1769), and finally Imperial-Royal Court Councillor (1787). During this time he also helped transfer the University of Nagyszombat to Buda Castle, and oversaw the building of the Court Theatre in Buda's former Carmelite monastery. He married twice, first in 1757 to Maria Franziska Piani, who died suddenly in 1758 of an abdominal obstruction, and again in 1762 to Maria Anna von Gobelius, who had served as a lady's companion in the house of Count Johannes Erd√∂dy, the vice-president of the Hungarian Court Chancery. Five children were born from his second marriage, of whom two survived into adulthood: Maria Theresia (1768‚Äì1812) and Karl (1771‚Äì1822). A reconstruction of The Turk The secret interior of The Turk  Inventions  Though he had a long and successful career as a civil servant, von Kempelen was most famous for his construction of The Turk, a chess-playing automaton presented to Maria Theresa of Austria in 1769. The machine consisted of a life-sized model of a human head and torso, dressed in Turkish robes and a turban, seated behind a large cabinet on top of which a chessboard was placed.Ricky Jay, \\"The Automaton Chess Player, the Invisible Girl, and the Telephone\\", Jay's Journal of Anomalies, vol. 4 no. 4, 2000. The machine appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, but was in fact merely an elaborate simulation of mechanical automation: a human chess master concealed inside the cabinet puppeteered the Turk from below by means of a series of levers. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. Kempelen also created a manually operated speaking machine.Flanagan, James L., \\"Speech Analysis, Synthesis and Perception\\", Springer-Verlag, 1965, pp. 166‚Äì167. An early version (possibly an original) can still be seen in the Musical Instruments section of the Deutsches Museum in Munich. In 1789, he published a book containing his nearly twenty years of speech research, Mechanismus Der Menschlichen Sprache Nebst Beschreibung Seiner Sprechenden Maschine.A reconstruction of Kempelen's speaking machine He constructed steam-engines, waterpumps, a pontoon bridge in Pressburg (1770), patented a steam turbine for mills (1788/89) and a typewriter for the blind Viennese pianist Maria Theresia von Paradis (1779), and built a theatre house in Buda (inaugurated 25 October 1790) (now Budapest) and the famous fountains at Sch√∂nbrunn in Vienna (1780). He was also a talented artist and etcher, wrote poems and epigrams, and composed a singspiel, Andromeda and Perseus, performed in Vienna.  Retirement and death  He retired in 1798, after forty-three years of service to the Austrian Empire. Some sources claim he was destitute at the time of his retirement because the Emperor revoked his pension, though this conclusion is most likely a misunderstanding of his multiple pensions. In 1771, Maria Theresia honored von Kempelen with an annual pension of 1,000 ducats for his exemplary work, but after her death, her son Joseph II made drastic cuts to the benefits granted to the court's civil servants, and von Kempelen's supplementary pension was revoked in 1781. Upon his retirement, von Kempelen was granted a pension equal to his final salary of 5,000 Gulden, and in 1802, he sought to recover the income from his smaller annual pension by submitting a petition to Francis II, requesting compensation in the amount of 20,000 Gulden accrued in expenses in service to the crown, but was ultimately denied. At the time of his death in 1804, he owned a country estate in Gomba near Pozsony, but died in his apartment in Alser, a suburb of Vienna. The Wolfgang von Kempelen Computing Science History Prize was named in his honor, as was a high school in Budapest.  Publications  * Mechanismus der menschlichen Sprache.

A black operation or black op is a covert or clandestine operation by a government agency, a military unit or a paramilitary organization; it can include activities by private companies or groups. Key features of a black operation are that it is secret and it is not attributable to the organization carrying it out. A single such activity may be called a black bag operation; that term is primarily used for covert or clandestine surreptitious entries into structures to obtain information for human intelligence operations. Such operations are known to have been carried out by the FBI, CIA, KGB, Mossad, MI6, ASIS, COMANF, DGSE, AISE, MSS, R&AW;, DGFI, SVR, FSB and the intelligence services of other nations. The main difference between a black operation and one that is merely secret is that a black operation involves a significant degree of deception, to conceal who is behind it or to make it appear that some other entity is responsible (\\"false flag\\" operations).Popular Electronics, Volume 6, Issue 2‚Äì6. Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., Inc. 1974, p. 267. \\"There are three classifications into which the intelligence community officially divides clandestine broadcast stations. A black operation is one in which there is a major element of deception.\\"Djang, Chu, From Loss to Renewal: A Tale of Life Experience at Ninety, Authors Choice Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, p. 54. \\"(A black operation was) an operation in which the sources of propaganda were disguised or misrepresented in one way or another so as not to be attributed to the people who really engineered it.\\" Etymology Black may be used as a generic term for any government activity that is hidden or secret. For example, in the United States, some activities by military and intelligence agencies are funded by a classified \\"black budget\\", of which the details, and sometimes even the total, are hidden from the public and from most congressional oversight. Reported examples * In May 2007 ABC News, and later the Daily Telegraph, reported that United States president George W. Bush had authorized the CIA to undertake \\"black operations\\" in Iran in order to promote regime change as well as to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. ABC News was subsequently criticized for reporting the secret operation, with 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney saying he was \\"shocked to see the ABC News report regarding covert action in Iran\\", but ABC said the CIA and the Bush Administration knew of their plans to publish the information and raised no objections. * In June 2007 the Central Intelligence Agency declassified secret records‚Äîpart of a collection of highly guarded documents called the \\"Family Jewels\\"‚Äîdetailing illegal domestic surveillance, assassination plots, kidnapping, and infiltration and penetration of other \\"black\\" operations undertaken by the CIA from the 1950s to the early 1970s. CIA Director General Michael Hayden explained why he released the documents, saying that they provided a \\"glimpse of a very different time and a very different agency\\". *In October 2016, The Week reported that the Special Group has been used to carry out black operations outside India by the Indian government, with one instance being the training of some members of the militant organisation Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. In popular culture The theme of black operations is a popular genre within fictional literature and Hollywood films. Both the spy film and spy fiction genres have had a significant following for many decades including such films as Apocalypse Now and Zero Dark Thirty and such authors as John le Carr√© and Tom Clancy. These \\"black operations\\" have also been a key point in video games. One such example is Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops, set in the early 1960s, where the player performs black operations such as trying to assassinate Fidel Castro and three other antagonists. Another example is Half-Life and its expansion pack Opposing Force, which both feature Black Ops as hostile factions. In the anime and manga series Naruto, a black ops unit called the Anbu features heavily, and several major characters are or were formerly members.

Legal principle that an accused may not be prosecuted for an act that is not declared a crime in that jurisdiction is actually about the Principle of legality which is part of the overall concept of legality.  Definitions  Vicki Schultz states that we collectively have a shared knowledge about most concepts. How we interpret the reality of our actual understanding of a concept manifests itself through the different individual narratives that we tell about the origins and meanings of a particular concept. The difference in narratives, about the same set of facts, is what divides us. An individual has the ability to frame, or understand, something very differently than the next person. Evidence does not always lead to a clear attribution of the specific cause or meaning of an issue ‚Äì meanings are derived through narratives. Reality, and the facts that surround it, are personally subjective and laden with assumptions based on clearly stated facts. Anna-Maria Marshall states, this shift in framing happens because our perceptions depend ‚Äúon new information and experiences;‚Äù this very idea is the basis of Ewick and Sibley definition of legality ‚Äì our everyday experiences shape our understanding of the law. Ewik and Silbey define \\"legality\\" more broadly as, those meanings, sources of authority, and cultural practices that are in some sense legal although not necessarily approved or acknowledged by official law. The concept of legality the opportunity to consider \\"how where and with what effect law is produced in and through commonplace social interactions....How do our roles and statuses our relationships, our obligations, prerogatives and responsibilities, our identities and our behavoiurs bear the imprint of law. In a paper on Normative Phenomena of Morality, Ethics and Legality, legality is defined taking the state's role in to account as, The system of laws and regulations of right and wrong behavior that are enforceable by the state (federal, state, or local governmental body in the U.S.) through the exercise of its policing powers and judicial process, with the threat and use of penalties, including its monopoly on the right to use physical violence.  Principle of legality  The principle of legality is the legal ideal that requires all law to be clear, ascertainable and non-retrospective. It requires decision makers to resolve disputes by applying legal rules that have been declared beforehand, and not to alter the legal situation retrospectively by discretionary departures from established law. It is closely related to legal formalism and the rule of law and can be traced from the writings of Feuerbach, Dicey and Montesquieu. The principle has particular relevance in criminal and administrative law. In criminal law it can be seen in the general prohibition on the imposition of criminal sanctions for acts or omissions that were not criminal at the time of their commission or omission. The principle is also thought to be violated when the sanctions for a particular crime are increased with retrospective effect. In administrative law it can be seen in the desire for state officials to be bound by and apply the law rather than acting upon whim. As such advocates of the principle are normally against discretionary powers. The principle can be varyingly expressed in Latin phrases such as Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali (No crime can be committed, nor punishment imposed without a pre-existing penal law), nulla poena sine lege (no penalty without law) and nullum crimen sine lege (no crime without law). A law that violates the principle by retroactively making actions illegal that were committed before the enactment of the law is called an ex post facto law.  Other related concepts  Rule of law provides for availability of rules, laws and legal mechanism to implement them. Principle of legality checks for availability and quality of the laws. Legality checks for if certain behaviour is according to law or not. concept of Legitimacy of law looks for fairness or acceptability of fairness of process of implementation of law. quality of being legal and observance to the law may pertain to lawfullness, i.e. being consistent to the law or it may get discussed in principle of legality or may be discussed as legal legitimacy. =Legality of purpose= In contract law, legality of purpose is required of every enforceable contract. One can not validate or enforce a contract to do activity with unlawful purpose. = Constitutional legality = The principle of legality can be affected in different ways by different constitutional models. In the United States, laws may not violate the stated provisions of the United States Constitution which includes a prohibition on retrospective laws. In Britain under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty, the legislature can (in theory) pass such retrospective laws as it sees fit, though article 7 of the European convention on human rights, which has legal force in Britain, forbids conviction for a crime which was not illegal at the time it was committed. Article 7 has already had an effect in a number of cases in the British courts. In contrast many written constitutions prohibit the creation of retroactive (normally criminal) laws. However the possibility of statutes being struck down creates its own problems. It is clearly more difficult to ascertain what is a valid statute when any number of statutes may have constitutional question marks hanging over them. When a statute is declared unconstitutional, the actions of public authorities and private individuals which were legal under the invalidated statute, are retrospectively tainted with illegality. Such a result could not occur under parliamentary sovereignty (or at least not before Factortame) as a statute was law and its validity could not be questioned in any court. International law Legality, in its criminal aspect, is a principle of international human rights law, and is incorporated into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. However the imposition of penalties for offences illegal under international law or criminal according to \\"the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\\" are normally excluded from its ambit. As such the trial and punishment for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity does not breach international law. There is some debate about whether this is really a true exception or not. Some people would argue that it is a derogation or ‚Äì perhaps somewhat more harshly ‚Äì an infringement of the principle of legality. While others would argue that crimes such as genocide are contrary to natural law and as such are always illegal and always have been. Thus imposing punishment for them is always legitimate. The exception and the natural law justification for it can be seen as an attempt to justify the Nuremberg trials and the trial of Adolf Eichmann, both of which were criticized for applying retrospective criminal sanctions. The territorial principle, generally confining national jurisdiction to a nation‚Äôs borders, has been expanded to accommodate extraterritorial, national interest. In criminal law, the principle of legality assures the primacy of law in all criminal proceedings.  Bibliography  * Kelsen, Hans.

In spite of the war and surrounding turbulence, Mrvica entered in, and won, his first major competition in Zagreb in 1993. Mrvica went on to study at the Music Academy in Zagreb where he spent five years under Professor Vladimir Krpan, who himself was a pupil of Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. He then spent a year at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest and during this year he won first prize at the Nikolai Rubinstein International Piano Competition.

It covered approximately the area of the modern Thai provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and much of the northern part of modern Malaysia. The 2nd‚Äì15th century state of Langkasuka and 6‚Äì7th century state of Pan Pan may or may not have been related. The Patani kingdom's golden age was during the reign of its four successive queens from 1584, known as Raja Hijau (The Green Queen), Raja Biru (The Blue Queen), Raja Ungu (The Purple Queen) and Raja Kuning (The Yellow Queen), during which the kingdom's economic and military strength was greatly increased to the point that it was able to fight off four major Siamese invasions. It had declined by the late 17th century and it was invaded by Siam in 1785 and annexed. Predecessors An early kingdom in the area was the Hindu-Buddhist Langkasuka, founded in the region as early as the 2nd century CE, which appeared in many accounts by Chinese travellers, the most famous of whom was the Buddhist pilgrim I-Ching. The kingdom drew trade from Chinese, Indian, and local traders as a stopping place for ships bound for, or just arrived from, the Gulf of Thailand. Langkasuka reached its greatest economic success in the 6th and 7th centuries and afterward declined as a major trade center. Political circumstances suggest that by the 11th century, Langkasuka was no longer a major port visited by merchants. However, much of the decline may be due to the silting up of the waterway linking it to the sea. The most substantial ruins believed to be ancient Langkasuka have been found in Yarang and are located approximately 15 kilometres from the sea and the current city of Pattani. How or when Langkasuka became replaced by Patani is not clear; Hikayat Patani indicates that the immediate predecessor of Patani was Kota Mahligai whose ruler founded Patani, perhaps some time between 1350‚Äì1450. This Patani was located in Keresik (name in Malay) or Kru Se (in Thai), a few kilometers to the east of the current city. However, some think Patani was the same country known to the Chinese as Pan Pan. The region had been subject to Thai control for some time. In the 14th century CE, King Ram Khamhaeng the Great (c.1239 ‚Äì 1317) of Sukhothai occupied Nakhon Si Thammarat and its vassal states which would include Patani if it had existed at that date. The Thai Ayutthaya kingdom conquered the isthmus during the 14th century CE, bringing many smaller vassal states under its control. This consisted of a self-governing system in which the vassal states and tributary provinces owed allegiance to the king of Ayutthaya, but otherwise ran their own affairs. Founding legends The Hikayat Patani. Folklore suggests the name Patani means \\"this beach\\" which is \\"pata ni\\" in the local Malay language. In this story, a ruler went hunting one day and saw a beautiful white mouse- deer the size of a goat, which then disappeared. He asked his men where the animal had gone, and they replied: \\"Pata ni lah!\\" This ruler then ordered a town be built where the mouse-deer had disappeared it was then named after \\"this beach\\". The founder is named in some sources as either Sri Wangsa or Phaya Tunakpa, a ruler of Kota Malikha or Kota Mahligai., from History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani. The first ruler of Patani (some sources say his son) later converted to Islam and took the name Sultan Ismail Shah or Mahmud Shah.History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani, Ibrahim Syukri, An alternative theory is that the Patani kingdom was founded in the 14th century. Local stories tell of a fisherman named Pak Tani (Father Tani), who was sent by a king from the interior to survey the coast, to find a place for an appropriate settlement. After he established a successful fishing outpost, other people moved to join him. The town soon grew into a prosperous trading center that continued to bear his name. The authors of the 17th‚Äì18th century Hikayat Patani chronicle claim this story is untrue, and support the claim that the kingdom was founded by the Sultan. Early History Patani has been suggested to be founded some time between 1350 to 1450, although its history before 1500 is unclear. The founder of Patani has been named as Sri Wangsa, or his son Raja Intera. He took the title of Phaya Tunakpa when he became the ruler. It is said that the ruler converted to Islam and took the name Sultan Ismail Shah or Mahmud Shah. Patani may have become Islamised some time in the middle of 15th century, one source gives a date of 1470, but earlier dates have been proposed. A story tells of a sheikh named Sa'id or Shafi'uddin from Kampong Pasai (presumably a small community of traders from Pasai who lived on the outskirts of Patani and reportedly healed the king of a rare skin disease. After much negotiation (and recurrence of the disease), the king agreed to convert to Islam, adopting the name Sultan Ismail Shah. All of the sultan's officials also agreed to convert. However, there is fragmentary evidence that some local people had begun to convert to Islam prior to this. The existence of a diasporic Pasai community near Patani shows the locals had regular contact with Muslims. There are also travel reports, such as that of Ibn Battuta, and early Portuguese accounts that claimed Patani had an established Muslim community even before Melaka (which officially converted in 1413), which would suggest that merchants who had contact with other emerging Muslims centres were the first to convert to the region. Patani 1837 Patani became more important after Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511 as Muslim traders sought alternative trading ports. A Dutch source indicates that most of the traders were Chinese, but 300 Portuguese traders had also settled in Patani by 1540s.. Sultan Ismail Shah was succeeded by Mudhaffar Shah. The 16th century witnessed the rise of Burma, which under an aggressive dynasty made war on Ayutthaya. A second siege (1563‚Äì64) led by King Bayinnaung forced King Maha Chakkraphat to surrender in 1564. With the brief decline of Ayutthaya's hegemony in this period, Patani may have become independent temporarily. In 1563, Mudhaffar Shah helped the Burmese attack Ayutthaya, but died suddenly in 1564 on his way back to Patani. His brother Sultan Manzur Shah (1564‚Äì1572) who was left in charge in Patani while he was away then became the ruler of Patani. Manzur Shah ruled for nine years, and after his death, Patani entered a period of political instability and violence. Two of its rulers were murdered by their relatives in fights for succession. Four queens of Patani =Raja Hijau and the golden age of Patani= Bunga mas, the tribute sent every three years to the Siamese ruler in Bangkok as symbol of friendship by the ruler of Patani. The sending of the Bunga mas began in the 14th century. Raja Hijau (or Ratu Hijau, the Green Queen) came to the throne in 1584, apparently the result of a lack of male heirs after they were murdered in the turbulent preceding period, and became the first queen of Patani. Raja Hijau acknowledged Siamese authority, and adopted the title of peracau derived from the Siamese royal title phra chao. Early in her reign she saw off an attempted coup by her prime minister, Bendahara Kayu Kelat. She also ordered that a channel be dug with a river dammed to divert water to ensure the supply of water to Patani. Raja Hijau ruled for 32 years, and brought considerable stability to the country. During her reign, trade with the outside increased, and as a result Pattani prospered. It also become a centre of culture, producing high quality works of music, dance, drama and handicraft. An Englishman Peter Floris who visited Patani in 1612‚Äì1613 described a dance performed in Patani as the finest he had seen in the Indies. Growth as a trade entrepot Chinese merchants, beginning with Zheng He in the period 1406‚Äì1433 CE, played a major role in the rise of Patani as a regional trade center. Chinese, Malay and Siamese merchants traded throughout the area, as well as Persians, Indians and Arabs. They were joined by others including the Portuguese in 1516, Japanese in 1592, Dutch in 1602, English in 1612. Many Chinese also moved to Patani, perhaps due to the activity of Lin Daoqian. A Dutch report of 1603 by Jacob van Neck estimated that there may be as many Chinese in Patani as there were native Malays, and they were responsible for most of the commercial activity of Patani. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) established warehouses in Patani in 1603, followed by the English East India Company in 1612, both carrying out intense trading. In 1619, John Jourdain, the East India Company's chief factor at Bantam was killed off the coast of Patani by the Dutch. Patani was seen by European traders as a way to access the Chinese market. After 1620, the Dutch and English both closed their warehouses, but a prosperous trade was continued by the Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese for most of the 17th century. =The Blue and Purple Queens= Raja Hijau died on 28 August 1616 to be succeeded by her sister Raja Biru (the Blue Queen), who was around 50 when she became queen. Raja Biru persuaded the Kelantan Sultanate that lied to the south to become incorporated into Patani. After Raja Biru died in 1624, she was succeeded by her younger sister Raja Ungu (the Purple Queen). Raja Ungu, however, was more confrontational towards the Siamese, and abandoned the title Siamese title peracau, using instead the title paduka syah alam (\\"her excellency ruler of the world\\"). She stopped paying the Bunga mas tribute to Siam, and formed an alliance with Johor, marrying her daughter (who later became Raja Kuning) off to their ruler Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III. However, her daughter was already married to the king of Bordelong (Phatthalung), Okphaya D√©ca, who prompted the Siamese to attack Patani in 1633‚Äì1634. Siam, however, failed to take Patani. =The Yellow Queen and decline= Patani 1782 Raja Ungu died in 1634, to be succeeded by the last of four successive female rulers of Patani Raja Kuning (or Ratu Kuning, the Yellow Queen). The war with Siam had caused considerable suffering to Patani as well as a significant decline in trade, and Raja Kuning adopted a more conciliatory stance towards the Siamese. The Siamese had intended to attack Patani again in 1635, but the Raja of Kedah intervened to help with the negotiation. In 1641, she visited the Ayutthaya court to resume good relation. The power of the queen had declined by this period, and she did not appear to wield any significant political power. In 1646, Patani joined other tributary states to rebel against Ayutthaya, but was later subdued by Ayutthaya. According to Kelantanese sources, Raja Kuning was deposed in 1651 by the Raja of Kelantan, who installed his son as the ruler of Patani, and the period of Kelantanese dynasty in Patani began. A different queen appeared to have been in control of Patini again by 1670 (three queens of Kelantan lineage may have ruled Patani from 1670 to 1718). When Phetracha took control of Ayutthaya in 1688, Patani refused to acknowledge his authority and rebelled. Ayutthaya then invaded with 50,000 men and subdued Patani. Following the invasion, political disorder continued for five decades, during which the local rulers were helpless to end the lawlessness in the region. Most foreign merchants abandoned trade with Patani. Towards the end of the 17th century, Patani was described in Chinese sources as sparsely populated and barbaric. Reassertion of Thai power In the 18th century, Ayutthaya under King Ekatat (Boromaraja V) faced another Burmese invasion. This culminated in the capture and destruction of the city of Ayutthaya in 1767, as well as the death of the king. Siam was shattered, and as rivals fought for the vacant throne, Patani declared its complete independence. King Taksin finally defeated the Burmese and reunified the country, opening the way for the establishment of the Chakri dynasty by his successor, King Rama I. In 1785, a resurgent Siam sent an army led by Prince Surasi (Viceroy Boworn Maha Surasinghanat), younger brother of King Rama I, to seek the submission of Patani. =Patani in the Bangkok Period= Patani was easily defeated by Siam in 1785 and resumed its tributary status. The city of Patani itself was sacked and destroyed, and a new town was later created a few miles to the west. However, a series of attempted rebellions prompted Bangkok to divide Patani into seven smaller puppet kingdoms in the early 1800s during the reign of King Rama II. Britain recognised the Thai ownership of Patani by the Burney Treaty in 1826.

Today he is remembered as one of the heroic figures from the disaster. Event On the morning of 6 December 1917, the 45-year- old Coleman and Chief Clerk William Lovett were working in the Richmond station, surrounded by the railway yards near the foot of Richmond Street, only a few hundred feet from Pier 6. From there, trains were controlled on the main line into Halifax. The line ran along the western shore of Bedford Basin from Rockingham Station to the city's passenger terminal at the North Street Station, located a mile to the south of Richmond Station. Coleman was an experienced dispatcher who had been commended a few years earlier for helping to safely stop a runaway train. At approximately 8:45 a.m., there was a collision between , a French munitions ship carrying a cargo of high explosives, and a Norwegian vessel, . Immediately thereafter Mont-Blanc caught fire, and the crew abandoned ship. The vessel drifted from near the mid- channel over to Pier 6 on the slack tide in a matter of minutes and beached herself.Investigation into the Halifax Explosion, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 596 and Appeal Book and other records, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 597, testimony of Edward McCrossan (SS Curacas), Library and Archives Canada. A sailor, believed to have been sent ashore by a naval officer, warned Coleman and Lovett of her cargo of high explosives.Scapegoat, the extraordinary legal proceedings following the 1917 Halifax Explosion, Joel Zemel (2012), note 80, p. 382. The only naval officer in the vicinity of Pier 6 before and after the collision with knowledge of Mont Blanc's cargo was the port convoy officer, Lieutenant James Anderson Murray (RNCVR), aboard Hilford. The small tug was chartered by the RN's Port Convoy Office under the command of Rear-Admiral Bertram M. Chambers. According to the testimony of Francis Mackey, the pilot of Mont- Blanc (Appeals Book: Imo vs. Mont-Blanc), Hilford was close enough to Pier 6 to put a sailor ashore quickly in order to warn people about the nature of the French ship's cargo. The overnight express train No. 10 from Saint John, New Brunswick, carrying nearly 300 passengers, was due to arrive at 8:55 a.m. Before leaving the office, Lovett called CGR terminal agent Henry Dustan to warn him of a burning ship laden with explosives that was heading for the pier.Investigation into the Halifax Explosion, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 596 and Appeal Book and other records, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 597, testimony of Henry Dustan, Library and Archives Canada. After sending Lovett's message, Coleman and Lovett were said to have left the CGR depot. However, the dispatcher returned to the telegraph office and continued sending warning messages along the rail line as far as Truro to stop trains inbound for Halifax. An accepted version of Coleman's Morse code message reads as follows: > Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbour making for Pier 6 and > will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys. The telegraphed warnings were apparently heeded, as the No. 10 passenger train was stopped just before the explosion occurred. The train was halted at Rockingham Station, on the western shore of Bedford Basin, approximately from the downtown terminal. After the explosion, Coleman's message, followed by other messages later sent by railway officials who made their way to Rockingham, passed word of the disaster to the rest of Canada. The railway quickly mobilized aid, sending a dozen relief trains with fire and medical help from towns in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the day of the disaster, followed two days later by help from other parts of Canada and from the United States, most notably Boston. Even though Lovett had left the station, both he and Coleman were killed in the explosion.Dan Conlin, \\"Vincent Coleman and the Halifax Explosion\\", Maritime Museum of the Atlantic web page ; Nova Scotia Vital Statistics. Although historians debate whether Coleman's initial message actually contributed to stopping the No. 10 train, there is some documented evidence to indicate it did. No. 10's Conductor Gillespie reported to the Moncton Transcript that although running on time, \\"his train was held for fifteen minutes by the dispatcher at Rockingham.\\"Built for War: Canada's Intercolonial Railway, Jay Underwood (2005).Coleman's headstone in Mount Olivet Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia Legacy Vince Coleman was also the subject of a Heritage Minute and was a prominent character in the CBC miniseries Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion. The Heritage Minute and other sources contain historical inaccuracies in that Coleman is shown warning others in the area surrounding the depot station of the impending explosion. In reality the Richmond Station was surrounded by freight yards. Another error is the exaggeration of the number of passengers aboard the Saint John train. The four-car overnight passenger train contained a maximum of 300 people, not 700 as claimed in the Heritage Minute. The warning message is also changed. Coleman's telegraph key, watch and pen are on display in the Halifax Explosion exhibit at Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. Coleman is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Halifax, at the intersection of Mumford Road with Joseph Howe Drive. A street is named after him in the Clayton Park neighbourhood of Halifax, and in 2007 a section of Albert Street near his old home was renamed Vincent Street. A condominium near Mount Olivet Cemetery on Bayer's Road is named The Vincent Coleman, also in his honour. Coleman was inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004. A Halifax harbour ferry was named Vincent Coleman, by popular vote in the spring of 2017. The ferry was dedicated and officially entered service in a ceremony at the Halifax ferry terminal on March 14, 2018 Personal life Coleman was survived by his wife Frances (1875-1970), although she and the youngest of their four children were seriously injured in the explosion.

B. Simpson, founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Albert Benjamin Simpson (December 15, 1843 ‚Äì October 29, 1919), also known as A. B. Simpson, was a Canadian preacher, theologian, author, and founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA;), an evangelical and Keswickian denomination with an emphasis on global evangelism. Early life and ministry Simpson was born in Bayview, near Cavendish, Prince Edward Island, Canada, as the third son and fourth child of James Simpson, Jr. and Janet Clark.George A. Rawlyk, Aspects of the Canadian Evangelical Experience, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, Canada, 1997, page 271 Author Harold H. Simpson has gathered an extensive genealogy of Cavendish families in Cavendish: Its History, Its People. His research establishes the Clark family (A. B. Simpson's mother's side) as one of the founding families of Cavendish in 1790, along with the Simpson family, and he traces common ancestors between Albert B. Simpson and Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of Anne of Green Gables. The young Albert was raised in a strict Calvinistic Scottish Presbyterian and Puritan tradition. His conversion of faith began under the ministry of Henry Grattan Guinness, a visiting evangelist from Ireland during the revival of 1859. Simpson spent some time in the Chatham, Ontario area, and received his theological training in Toronto at Knox College, University of Toronto. After graduating in 1865, Simpson was subsequently ordained in the Canada Presbyterian Church, the largest of the Presbyterian groups in Canada that merged after his departure for the United States. At age 21, he accepted a call to the large Knox Presbyterian Church (closed in 1971) in nearby Hamilton, Ontario. In December 1873, at age 30, Simpson left Canada and assumed the pulpit of the largest Presbyterian church in Louisville, Kentucky, the Chestnut Street Presbyterian Church. It was in Louisville that he first conceived of preaching the gospel to the common man by building a simple tabernacle for that purpose. Despite his success at the Chestnut Street Church, Simpson was frustrated by their reluctance to embrace this burden for wider evangelistic endeavor. In 1880, Simpson was called to the Thirteenth Street Presbyterian Church in New York City where he immediately began reaching out to the world with the gospel. By 1881, after only two fruitful years at Thirteenth Presbyterian, he resigned in order to begin an independent gospel ministry to the many new immigrants and the neglected masses of New York City.Klaus Fiedler, The Story of Faith Missions: From Hudson Taylor to Present Day Africa, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2011, page Beside active evangelistic work in the church, he published in 1882 a missionary journal, The Gospel in All Lands, the first missionary journal with pictures.J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann, Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, page 605 Simpson also founded and began publishing an illustrated magazine entitled The Word, Work, and World. By 1911, this magazine became known as The Alliance Weekly, then Alliance Life. It is the official publication of The Christian and Missionary Alliance, in the US and Canada. In 1882, Simpson began informal training classes in order to reach \\"the neglected peoples of the world with the neglected resources of the church\\".William Kostlevy, Historical Dictionary of the Holiness Movement, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, page 270 By 1883, a formal program was in place and ministers and missionaries were being trained in a multi-cultural context (This school was the beginning of Nyack College and Alliance Theological Seminary). In 1889, Simpson and his church family moved into their new home at the corner of 44th St. and 8th Av. called the New York Tabernacle. This became the base not only of his ministry of evangelism in the city but also of his growing work of worldwide missions. Teaching Simpson's disciplined upbringing and his natural genius made him a most effective communicator of the Word of God. He preached a unique gospel of Jesus which became known as the Fourfold Gospel: \\"Jesus our Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and Coming King\\".Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2002, page 128 The Fourfold Gospel is symbolized in the logo of the C&MA; : the Cross, the Laver, the Pitcher and the Crown. He came to his special emphasis in ministry through his absolute Christ-centeredness in doctrine and experience. Albert Benjamin Simpson was a Keswickian, teaching the doctrine of entire sanctification heralded by the Higher Life movement. Plagued by illness for much of his life since childhood, Simpson believed he experienced divine healing after understanding it to be part of the blessing of abiding in Christ as Life and healing. He emphasized healing in his Fourfold Gospel and usually devoted one meeting a week for teaching, testimonies and prayer on these lines. Although such teaching isolated him (and the C&MA;) from the mainline churches that either did not emphasize or outright rejected healing, Simpson was uncompromising in his beliefs. Simpson's heart for evangelism was to become the driving force behind the creation of the C&MA.; Initially, the Christian and Missionary Alliance was not founded as a denomination, but as an organized movement of world evangelism. Today, the C&MA; plays a leadership role in global evangelism. In his 1890 book, A Larger Christian Life, Simpson discussed his vision for the church: Simpson composed the lyrics of over 120 hymns, 77 of which appear in the C&MA;'s 1962 hymnal, Hymns of the Christian Life, co-edited with R. Kelso Carter.Hymns of the Christian Life: A Book of Worship in Song Emphasizing Evangelism, Missions, and the Deeper Life, 1962 revised and enlarged edition. Harrisburg, PA: Christian Publications, 1962. His missionary vision is illustrated by these words of his hymn, \\"The Missionary Cry\\": Influence on Pentecostalism During the beginning of the twentieth century, Simpson became closely involved with the growing Pentecostal movement, an offshoot of the Holiness movement. It was common for Pentecostal pastors and missionaries to receive their training at the Missionary Training Institute, now Nyack College, Nyack, New York, that Simpson founded. Because of this, Simpson and the C&MA; had a great influence on Pentecostalism, in particular the Assemblies of God and the Church of the Foursquare Gospel. This influence included evangelistic emphasis, C&MA; doctrine (especially on healing and his articulation of a Fourfold Gospel), and Simpson's hymns and books.Blumhofer, Edith L. The Assemblies of God: A Chapter in the Story of American Pentecostalism Volume 1‚ÄîTo 1941. Springfield, Missouri: Gospel Publishing House, 1989. . Pages 29‚Äì31. A severe division developed within the C&MA; organization over \\"the initial evidence doctrine\\" within Pentecostalism. While Simpson and the C&MA; wholeheartedly embraced the Filling of the Holy Spirit and the spiritual gifts, including speaking with tongues, they rejected the position that tongues was the only initial evidence for that Baptism experience; instead, they held that the primary evidence is the Fruit of the Holy Spirit and that \\"fruitful ministry\\" is another strong proof.The Christian and Missionary Alliance. \\"Spiritual Gifts\\", Official Position Paper  Legacy  A number of C&MA; churches bear Simpson's name, including (i) Simpson University in Redding, California, (ii) the Albert B. Simpson school in Lima, Peru, (iii) the A. B. Simpson Alliance School in Zamboanga City, Philippines, and (iv) the Simpson Memorial Church (established in 1923) in Jamalpur, Ahmedabad, India. A. B. Simpson and his wife, Margaret (n√©e Margaret L. Henry; 1841‚Äì1924), are buried on the Rockland County Campus of Nyack College in Nyack, New York.  Works  1.

In 2008 a population of the Sangihe tarsier was determined to be a distinct species, the Siau Island tarsier (Tarsius tumpara).  Taxonomy  It was first assigned species status in 1896 by Adolf Meyer. It was later classified as a subspecies of the spectral tarsier T. spectrum by Hill and remained so until recently. Today it is recognized as a distinct species. The Siau Island tarsier, Tarsius tumpara, from Siau Island was formerly considered a population of the Sangihe tarsier, but was determined to be a separate species in 2008. There is still much debate on what is considered a species and a subspecies in the family Tarsiidae.  Description  The large, round, forward-facing, pale-chestnut- colored eyes and elongated digits and tarsus are basic characteristics of the Sangihe tarsier. It is a very small primate weighing between 100 and 120 grams. It has sharp teeth, since it strictly eats animal matter. The tails are very long compared to body size and are used for support while stationary but are not truly prehensile in nature. Upper pelage is yellowish brown with dark- grey bases. Lower parts of it are a dullish-white with a light-grey base. Its eyes are immobile but it has the ability to rotate its head 180 degrees. The best way to distinguish this species from other tarsier species is by the amount of fur on its tail, and its \\"acoustics\\" (calls). The Sangihe tail has a sparse covering of dorsal fur, and does not have scales underneath.  Distribution and habitat  The Sangihe tarsier is endemic to the Sangihe Islands in Indonesia which is only 547 km2. It favors primary-growth forest but also fares well in secondary-growth forest. It also has been found in scrub habitats, coconut plantations, and in some cases agricultural areas. However, researchers are not sure if the populations found in agricultural areas are due to source-sink dynamic. All tarsiers live within 10 latitudinal degrees of the equator and require humid conditions, at least 50% humidity.  Behaviour and ecology  The mating pattern is monogamous or polygamous. It tends to be solitary or lives in small groups of 2‚Äì6. Groups mainly consist of the parents and offspring. Little is known about their specific mating patterns and reproduction development. What is known is based on better- documented species. It normally gives birth to a single offspring. There is little sexual dimorphism. It is a nocturnal species, which makes it even harder to document. Most tarsiers are relatively silent creatures and only make chirping sounds. Chirping can be mostly heard when males are trying to mate with females. Most of its communication is through scent, such as urine. = Diet = It eats mainly insects such as grasshoppers and beetles. It is occasionally seen eating small vertebrates like lizards. Tarsiers are the only know primates that are completely carnivorous. The digestive tract is very simple and short. It does not forage for insects like other insectivores but instead sits and waits. Once prey is spotted it will use it hands to grab it or leap and catch it.  Conservation  The Sangihe tarsier is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is listed as an Appendix II species under CITES. Currently there are no specific conservation programs for this species of tarsier. There is also a lack of nature reserves located in its native land. It is very difficult to have any type of ex-situ conservation for this species, since it does not fare well outside their natural habitat. Since little is known about the species' reproduction patterns, there are not any breeding programs currently. Shekelle and Salim made some proposals on better protection for this species along with the Siau Island tarsier. Such actions include more investments on improving ex-situ conservation, mimic sanctuaries found for a subspecies of the Philippine tarsier Carlito syrichta fraterculus along with tarsier-tracking activities. Some of the above would increase ecotourism in the area and improve economics in the area. The authors also recommend increasing awareness of the species and advising people on how to better manage their lands to improve chances of the survival of the species. = Threats = The population is thought to be between 1,505 and 52,734. Accurate numbers are hard to estimate due to cloud coverage over its range. Some of its natural threats include birds, snakes, and the giant civet. Mount Awu can also be considered a natural threat as well, since it is an active and deadly volcano on the island. Anthropogenic causes include habitat loss or fragmentation, the introduction of cats and dogs to the island, population density increases in its territory, and pet trade.

It consisted of eight identical buildings and was in length parallel to the beach, with the surviving structures stretching . Although the buildings were planned as a holiday resort, construction was not completed and they were not used for this purpose. After World War II, the complex found various military uses, first by the Soviet Army, then by the East German Volksarmee, and then by the German Bundeswehr. Today it houses a large youth hostel, a hotel and vacation apartments. The complex has a formal heritage listing as a particularly striking example of Third Reich architecture. Location Prora lies on an extensive bay between the Sassnitz and Binz regions, known as the Prorer Wiek, on the narrow heath (the Prora) which separates the lagoon of the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden from the Baltic Sea. The buildings extended over a length of and are roughly from the beach. The coast offers a long flat sand beach, which stretches from Binz to the ferry port. This beach was thus an ideal location for the establishment of a seaside resort. Plans Typical room (December 2010) Corridor in building \\"Nordfl√ºgel 1\\", 4th level (2011) The Strength Through Joy program was designed to attract the working class ‚Äì who had during the Weimar Republic been the power base of the Social Democrats and, to a lesser extent, the Communists ‚Äì to the Nazi Party by offering numerous cultural events and mass tourism at affordable prices. They also presented an opportunity for the inculcation of Nazi ideology through constant indoctrination by propaganda. Founded in November 1933, in the year 1934, 400,000 people took Strength Through Joy package tours, a number which rose to 1.7 million by 1937, not to mention 7 million who availed themselves of weekend excursions and 1.6 million who participated in organized hikes.Evans, Richard J. (2005) The Third Reich in Power New York: Penguin Books. pp.465‚Äì70. Robert Ley, head of the German Labour Front ‚Äì of which Strength Through Joy was a subsidiary ‚Äì envisioned Prora as a parallel to Butlins, which were British \\"holiday camps\\" designed to provide affordable holidays for the average worker. Prora was designed to house 20,000 holidaymakers, under the ideal that every worker deserved a holiday at the beach. Designed by Clemens Klotz, who won a design competition overseen by Adolf Hitler's chief architect Albert Speer, all rooms were planned to overlook the sea, while corridors and sanitation are located on the landward side. Each room of by was to have two beds, a wardrobe and a sink. There were communal toilets, showers and bathrooms on each floor. Hitler's plans for Prora were much more ambitious. He wanted a gigantic sea resort, the \\"most mighty and large one to ever have existed\\", holding 20,000 beds. In the middle, a huge building was to be erected. At the same time, Hitler wanted it to be convertible into a military hospital in case of war. Hitler insisted that the plans of a giant indoor arena by architect Erich Putlitz be included. Putlitz's Festival Hall was intended to be able to accommodate all 20,000 guests at the same time. His plans included two wave-swimming pools, a cinema and a theatre. A large dock for passenger ships was also planned. The designs won a Grand Prix award at the 1937 Paris World Exposition.  Construction  Seaside view of Prora in 2004 In 2019 after renovation Construction began in 1936 and during the few years that Prora was under construction, all major construction companies of the Reich and nearly 9,000 workers were involved in this project. By 1938, construction costs had reached 237.5 million Reichsmarks (equivalent to ‚Ç¨ in 2009). With the onset of World War II in 1939, building on Prora stopped and the construction workers transferred to the V-Weapons plant at Peenem√ºnde. The eight housing blocks and the theatre and cinema remained empty shells. The swimming pools and festival hall never materialised. If the complex had been completed, it would have been the largest holiday resort in the world.Lochner, Louis P. (1942) What About Germany? New York: Dodd, Mead. p.32Hatherly, Owen (6 November 2017) \\"Hitler's holiday camp: how the sprawling resort of Prora met a truly modern fate\\" The Guardian. Retrieved 15 January 2019  Usage  =WWII= During the Allied bombing campaign, many people from Hamburg took refuge in one of the housing blocks, and later refugees from the east of Germany were housed there. By the end of the war, these buildings housed female auxiliary personnel for the Luftwaffe. = Cold War= In 1945 the Soviet Army took control of the region and established a military base at Prora. The Soviet Army's 2nd Artillery Brigade occupied block 5 of Prora from 1945 to 1955. The Soviet military then stripped all usable materials from the building. In the late 1940s two of the housing blocks ‚Äì one at the North and one at the South ‚Äì were demolished and the remains mostly removed. In the late 1950s the East German military rebuilt several of the buildings. Since the buildings had been stripped to the bare brick in the late 1940s, most of the exterior and interior finish that can now be seen was done under East German control. After the formation of the German Democratic Republic's (GDR's) National People's Army in 1956, the buildings became a restricted military area housing several East German Army units. The most prominent were the elite 40. Fallschirmj√§gerbataillon Willi S√§nger (40th Parachute Battalion \\"Willi S√§nger\\") which was housed in block 5 from 1960 to 1982. Block 4 on the north side was used for urban combat training by the Parachute Battalion and others. Large sections remain as ruins to this day. Also housed in the building from 1982 to 1990 was the East German Army Construction Battalion \\"Mukran\\", where conscientious objectors served as noncombatant Construction Soldiers (Bausoldaten) to meet their military service obligation. A part of the building also served as the East German Army's \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" convalescent home. =Unified Germany = After German reunification in 1990, the National People's Army of the GDR was absorbed into the West Germany Bundeswehr, that took over the building. Initially consideration was given to demolishing the buildings, but it was later given landmark protection and a tax break offered to developers to renovate it. Parts of the building were used from 1990 to 1992 by the Military Technical School of the Bundeswehr. From 1992 to 1994 a part of the building was used to house asylum seekers from the Balkans. Beginning in early 1993, the facility was empty and the buildings were subject to decay and vandalism. An exception to this was Block 3, Prora Center, which from 1995 to 2005 housed a variety of museums, special exhibitions, and a gallery. Between 1993 and 1999 the site served as one of the largest youth hostels in Europe. Since 2000, the Documentation Centre Prora has been located at the southern edge of the fairground buildings. This center documents the construction and use history of the building. Discussed here are both the background of the project and its appropriation for Nazi propaganda.  Sale and redevelopment  Renovated part in 2016 In 2004, following more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts to sell the site as a whole, the blocks of the building began being sold off individually for various uses. On 23 September 2004, Block 6 sold for 625,000 euros to an unknown bidder. On 23 February 2005, Block 3, the former Museum Mile, was sold to Inselbogen GmbH, which announced that the building would be used as a hotel. In October 2006, Block 1 and 2 were sold to Prora Projektentwicklungs GmbH which has announced plans of converting the buildings into shops and apartments. However Block 1 was re- offered for sale at an auction on 31 March 2012 and was purchased by a Berlin investor for 2.75 million euros. In November 2006, the Federal Agency for Real Estate purchased Block 5. With financial support from the federal government and the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern it planned to establish a youth hostel in the building. Located in the northernmost part of the complex, it was divided into five contiguous parts. In late 2008, plans were approved to have Prora fill its original purpose and to turn it into a modern tourist resort. The council set out plans to build enough living space to house 3,000 people, as well as a youth hostel, and amenities for tourists. Kerstin Kassner, a local councillor, compared Prora's shore with a \\"Caribbean beach.\\" However, the decision met with some scepticism from Binz locals, who felt that there were already too many tourists in the region, and Heike Tagsold, a Prora historian, who said that the town's past made it an inappropriate location for tourists. Nevertheless, in 2011 the long-planned large youth hostel with 402 beds in 96 rooms opened; it is the largest youth hostel in Germany and has been popular. A possible expansion of the facility aimed toward budget-minded tourists has been proposed. In September 2010, plans were announced by a German-Austrian investor group to renovate blocks 1 and 2 as housing for the elderly and a hotel with 300 beds that includes tennis courts and swimming pool and a small shopping centre. The investment costs are estimated at 100 million euros. = Metropole Marketing = In 2013, a German company, Metropole Marketing, bought the rights to refurbish Prora and market the units as summer homes. By that year, refurbished apartments in the so-called Colossus were on sale for as much as 700,000 euros ($900,000) apiece. The completion date was estimated as 2016. In 2016, the first of the new apartments opened in Block 1. The Prora Solitaire hotel in Block 2 opened in time for summer 2016, and some reconstructed flats were for sale in that Block by mid 2017. At that time, four of the buildings were in the process of redevelopment, a fifth was used as a youth hostel while the remaining three remained in ruins. A November 2017 update indicated that most of the units (flats) in Block 1 had been sold, having been marketed as summer homes for those who live in Hamburg and Berlin. Many were listed by owners as short term rentals on sites such as Airbnb and HomeAway. In popular culture Prora was featured in the video game Civilization V, specifically within the expansion pack Civilization V: Brave New World. It appears in the game as a wonder associated with the ideology Autocracy.  References  Notes Further reading * Kaule, Martin: Prora. Geschichte und Gegenwart des ¬ªKdF-Seebads R√ºgen¬´. Ch.

They form memory cells that remember the same pathogen for faster antibody production in future infections. Memory B cells (MBCs) are a B cell sub-type that are formed within germinal centers following primary infection. Memory B cells can survive for decades and repeatedly generate an accelerated and robust antibody-mediated immune response in the case of re-infection (also known as a secondary immune response).  Primary response  In a T-cell dependent development pathway, na√Øve follicular B cells are activated by antigen presenting TFH cells during the initial infection, or primary immune response. After activation, the B cells move into the secondary lymphoid organs (i.e. spleen and lymph nodes). Within the secondary lymphoid organs, most of the B cells will enter B-cell follicles where a germinal center will form. Most B cells will eventually differentiate into plasma cells or memory B cells within the germinal center. Once inside the germinal center, the B cells undergo proliferation, followed by mutation of the genetic coding region of their surface receptors, a process known as somatic hypermutation. The mutations will either increase or decrease the affinity of the surface receptor for a particular antigen, a progression called affinity maturation. After acquiring these mutations, the receptors on the surface of the B cells (B cell receptors) are tested within the germinal center for their affinity to the current antigen. B cell clones with mutations that have increased the affinity of their surface receptors receive survival signals via interactions with their cognate TFH cells. The B cells that do not have high enough affinity to receive these survival signals, as well as B cells that are potentially auto-reactive, will be selected against and die through apoptosis. In addition to somatic hypermutation, many B cells will also undergo class switching before differentiation, which allows them to secrete different types of antibodies in future immune responses. Many B cells will differentiate into the plasma cells, also called effector B cells, which produce a first wave of protective antibodies and help clear infection. A fraction of the B cells differentiate into memory B cells that survive long- term in the body. The process of differentiation into memory B cells within the germinal center is not yet fully understood. Some researchers hypothesize that differentiation into memory B cells occurs randomly. Other hypotheses propose that the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B and the cytokine IL-24 are involved in the process of differentiation into memory B cells. An additional hypothesis states that the B cells with relatively lower affinity for antigen will become memory B cells, in contrast to B cells with relatively higher affinity that will become plasma cells. After differentiation, memory B cells relocate to the periphery of the body where they will be more likely to encounter antigen in the event of a future exposure. Many of the circulating B cells become concentrated in areas of the body that have a high likelihood of coming into contact with antigen, such as the Peyer's patch.  Secondary response and memory  The memory B cells produced during the primary immune response are specific to the antigen involved during the first exposure. In a secondary response, the memory B cells specific to the antigen or similar antigens will respond. When memory B cells reencounter their specific antigen, they proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells, which then respond to and clear the antigen. The memory B cells that do not differentiate into plasma cells at this point can reenter the germinal centers to undergo further class switching or somatic hypermutation for further affinity maturation. Differentiation of memory B cells into plasma cells is far faster than differentiation by na√Øve B cells, which allows memory B cells to produce a more efficient secondary immune response. The efficiency and accumulation of the memory B cell response is the foundation for vaccines and booster shots.  Lifespan  Memory B cells can survive for decades, which gives them the capacity to respond to multiple exposures to the same antigen. The long- lasting survival is hypothesized to be a result of certain anti-apoptosis genes that are more highly expressed in memory B cells than other subsets of B cells. Additionally, the memory B cell does not need to have continual interaction with the antigen nor with T cells in order to survive long-term.  Markers  Memory B cells are typically distinguished by the cell surface marker CD27, although some subsets do not express CD27. Memory B cells that lack CD27 are generally associated with exhausted B cells or certain autoimmune conditions such as HIV, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis. Because B cells have typically undergone class switching, they can express a range of immunoglobulin molecules. Some specific attributes of particular immunoglobulin molecules are described below: * IgM: Memory B cells that express IgM can be found concentrated in the tonsils, Peyer's patch, and lymph nodes. This subset of memory B cells is more likely to proliferate and reenter the germinal center during a secondary immune response. * IgG: Memory B cells that express IgG typically differentiate into plasma cells. * IgE: Memory B cells that express IgE are very rare in healthy individuals. This may occur because B cells that express IgE more frequently differentiate into plasma cells rather than memory B cells * IgD only: Memory B cells that express IgD are very rare. B cells with only IgD are found concentrated in the tonsils. The receptor CCR6 is generally a marker of B cells that will eventually differentiate into MBCs. This receptor detects chemokines, which are chemical messengers that allow the B cell to move within the body. Memory B cells may have this receptor to allow them to move out of the germinal center and into the tissues where they have a higher probability of encountering antigen.  Subsets  = Germinal center independent memory B cells = This subset of cells differentiates from activated B cells into memory B cells before entering the germinal center. B cells that have a high level of interaction with TFH within the B cell follicle have a higher propensity of entering the germinal center. The B cells that develop into memory B cells independently from germinal centers likely experience CD40 and cytokine signaling from T cells. Class switching can still occur prior to interaction with the germinal center, while somatic hypermutation only occurs after interaction with the germinal center. The lack of somatic hypermutation is hypothesized to be beneficial; a lower level of affinity maturation means that these memory B cells are less specialized to a specific antigen and may be able to recognize a wider range of antigens. T-independent memory B cells T-independent memory B cells are a subset called B1 cells. These cells generally reside in the peritoneal cavity. When reintroduced to antigen, some of these B1 cells can differentiate into memory B cells without interacting with a T cell. These B cells produce IgM antibodies to help clear infection. T-bet memory B cells T-bet B cells are a subset that have been found to express the transcription factor T-bet. T-bet is associated with class switching. T-bet B cells are also thought to be important in immune responses against intracellular bacterial and viral infections.

Banks in 1971. The cells outside the image are all dead (white). An orphan in Life found by Achim Flammenkamp. Black squares are required live cells; blue x's are required dead cells. In a cellular automaton, a Garden of Eden is a configuration that has no predecessor. It can be the initial configuration of the automaton but cannot arise in any other way. John Tukey named these configurations after the Garden of Eden in Abrahamic religions, which was created out of nowhere. A Garden of Eden is determined by the state of every cell in the automaton (usually a one- or two-dimensional infinite square lattice of cells). However, for any Garden of Eden there is a finite pattern (a subset of cells and their states, called an orphan) with the same property of having no predecessor, no matter how the remaining cells are filled in. A configuration of the whole automaton is a Garden of Eden if and only if it contains an orphan. For one- dimensional cellular automata, orphans and Gardens of Eden can be found by an efficient algorithm, but for higher dimensions this is an undecidable problem. Nevertheless, computer searches have succeeded in finding these patterns in Conway's Game of Life. The Garden of Eden theorem of Moore and Myhill asserts that a cellular automaton on the square grid, or on a tiling of any higher dimensional Euclidean space, has a Garden of Eden if and only if it has twins, two finite patterns that have the same successors whenever one is substituted for the other. Definitions A cellular automaton is defined by a grid of cells, a finite set of states that can be assigned to each cell, and an update rule. Often, the grid of cells is the one- or two-dimensional infinite square lattice. The update rule determines the next state of each cell as a function of its current state and of the current states of certain other nearby cells (the neighborhood of the cell). The neighborhood can be an arbitrary finite set of cells, but each two cells should have neighbors in the same relative positions and all cells must use the same update rule. A configuration of the automaton is an assignment of a state to every cell., Section 2.1, \\"Basic Definitions\\", pp. 5‚Äì6. The successor of a configuration is another configuration, formed by applying the update rule simultaneously to every cell.. Note however that Toffoli and Margolus refer to the transition function as the global map. The transition function of the automaton is the function that maps each configuration to its successor. If the successor of configuration X is configuration Y, then X is a predecessor of Y. A configuration may have zero, one, or more predecessors, but it always has exactly one successor. A Garden of Eden is defined to be a configuration with zero predecessors., p. 10. A pattern, for a given cellular automaton, consists of a finite set of cells together with a state for each of those cells., p. 11. A configuration contains a pattern when the states of the cells in the pattern are the same as the states of the same cells in the configuration (without translating the cells before matching them). The definition of predecessors of configurations can be extended to predecessors of patterns: a predecessor of a pattern is just a configuration whose successor contains the pattern. An orphan, then, is a pattern with no predecessor.  Searching for the Garden of Eden  For one-dimensional cellular automata, Gardens of Eden can be found by an efficient algorithm whose running time is polynomial in the size of the rule table of the automaton. For higher dimensions, determining whether a Garden of Eden exists is an undecidable problem, meaning that there is no algorithm that can be guaranteed to terminate and produce the correct answer.; . Kari's main result is that it is undecidable to test whether a cellular automaton is reversible, but he also shows the undecidability of testing whether a Garden of Eden exists. Nevertheless, in many cases it is possible to use the Garden of Eden theorem (below) to infer that a solution exists and then use a search algorithm to find one. It would be possible for a computer program to search for orphan patterns by systematically examining all finite patterns, in order by increasing size, and by testing all possible predecessors for each pattern to determine whether it is in fact an orphan. However, the number of patterns that would need to be generated to find a Garden of Eden in this way is exponential in the area of the pattern. This enormous number of patterns would make this type of brute-force search prohibitively expensive, even for relatively small sizes of patterns.: \\"Even if one were willing to fall back on a brute-force search, a long search time would generate only a few items, and even those would be for the most part quite uninteresting.\\" pioneered a more efficient computational approach for finding orphan patterns. His method is based on the theory of formal languages, and takes an amount of time that is exponential in the width of the pattern rather than its area. The key idea is that, for any fixed width, it is possible to construct a nondeterministic finite automaton that recognizes patterns of a given width that have a predecessor. The input symbols to this machine describe each row of the pattern, and the states of the machine describe the nearby rows of possible predecessors for the part of the pattern that has been input so far. One can construct from this machine another finite state machine that recognizes the complementary set, the patterns that do not have predecessors, by converting the nondeterministic finite state machine to a deterministic finite automaton by using the powerset construction, and then complementing its set of accepting states. Once a machine recognizing the complementary set has been constructed, one may test whether the language it recognizes is empty, by searching for a path from the start state to an accepting state. This path, if it exists, gives a row-by-row description of an orphan pattern. Martin Gardner credits Alvy Ray Smith with the observation that the Garden of Eden theorem applies to Conway's Game of Life, and proves the existence of Gardens of Eden for this rule. The first explicit Garden of Eden in Life, with its live cells fitting in a rectangle, was identified as a candidate to be a Garden of Eden by Roger Banks in 1971, and then verified by an exhaustive backtracking search for predecessors.In Lifeline Vol. 3 (September 1971), editor Robert T. Wainwright announced that Roger Banks and Steve Ward had proven the existence of a Garden of Eden whose live cells fit into a rectangle, and presented a configuration believed by Banks to be a Garden of Eden. In Lifeline Vol. 4 (December 1971), Wainwright reported that a group at Honeywell using software by Don Woods had verified Banks' configuration to be a Garden of Eden. See also . Subsequently, Hardouin-Duparc used his formal language approach to find the narrowest possible Gardens of Eden in Conway's Game of Life, with the bounding box for their live cells being only six cells wide. The smallest known orphan pattern in Conway's Game of Life (by area of its bounding box) was found by Steven Eker in April 2016. It has 57 living cells and fits in an 8√ó12 rectangle. Existence of orphans By definition, every orphan belongs to a Garden of Eden: extending an orphan to a configuration of the whole automaton, by choosing a state for each remaining cell arbitrarily, will always produce a Garden of Eden. But the reverse is also true: every Garden of Eden contains at least one orphan.The one-dimensional case of this result is Theorem 5.1 of . As in the simpler proof given here, it uses compactness of the configuration space. In their earlier work, Moore and Myhill did not distinguish orphans from Gardens of Eden, and proved their results only in terms of orphans. To prove this, Kari, Proposition 2, p. 11. uses a topological argument, based on the Curtis‚ÄìHedlund‚ÄìLyndon theorem according to which the transition functions of cellular automata are exactly the translation-invariant continuous functions on the space of configurations., Theorem 3.4. Here, continuity is defined by assigning a discrete topology to the finite set of states of the automaton, and then using a product topology with one term in the product for each cell in the automaton to construct a topological space whose points are the automaton's configurations. By Tychonoff's theorem it is a compact space. For each finite pattern, the set of configurations that contain the pattern is an open set in this topology, called a cylinder. The cylinders form a basis for the topology. As Kari observes, the collection of configurations that are not Gardens of Eden is just the image of the transition function, so by the closed map lemma for compact spaces it is a closed set. The set of Gardens of Eden, correspondingly, is an open set. Because it is open and the cylinders form a basis, the set of Gardens of Eden can be represented as a union of cylinders. Each of the cylinders in this union consists only of Gardens of Eden, so the pattern that determines each cylinder must be an orphan. If the set of Gardens of Eden is non-empty, there must be at least one cylinder in this union, so there must be at least one orphan. And any particular Garden of Eden must belong to one of these cylinders, and therefore must contain the orphan for that cylinder.  The Garden of Eden theorem  In a cellular automaton, two finite patterns are twins if one can be substituted for the other wherever it appears, without changing future configurations. A cellular automaton is injective if every pair of distinct configurations of the automaton remain different after a step of the automaton, and locally injective if it has no twins. It is surjective if and only if every configuration has a predecessor; that is, if and only if it has no Garden of Eden configuration. An automaton that is both injective and surjective is called a reversible cellular automaton. The Garden of Eden theorem, due to and , asserts that a cellular automaton in a Euclidean space is locally injective if and only if it is surjective. In other words, it asserts that a cellular automaton has a Garden of Eden, if and only if it has twins. More strongly, every non-locally- injective cellular automaton has an orphan pattern. An immediate corollary is that an injective cellular automaton must be surjective. Moore proved one direction of the theorem, that automata with twins have orphans; Myhill proved the converse, that an automaton with an orphan also has twins. In the case of Conway's Game of Life, twins are much easier to find than orphans. For instance, a five-by-five block of dead cells and a five-by-five block with its center cell live and the remaining cells dead are twins: the state of the center cell cannot affect later configurations of the pattern. Thus, in this case, the Garden of Eden theorem allows the existence of a Garden of Eden to be demonstrated much more easily than by finding an explicit orphan pattern. =Proof sketch= The main idea of the proof of the theorem is to use a counting argument, to show that any failure of local injectivity (twin patterns) leads to an orphan pattern, and vice versa. In more detail, suppose for concreteness that the underlying lattice of the automaton is a two- dimensional square grid, that it has different cell states, that the twin patterns and both fit into an square, and that the radius of any cell's neighborhood is at most . Then, in order to determine whether a pattern that fits within an square is an orphan, one need only look at the parts of potential predecessors that fit within an square and that do not contain pattern . But there are only of these potential predecessors. For sufficiently large values of this number is smaller than the number of potential orphans. Therefore, one of the potential orphans has no predecessor and is really an orphan; that is, non-injectivity implies non-surjectivity. Conversely (letting be the size of a bounding box of an orphan) a very similar counting argument shows that the number of patterns that fit within an square and do not contain an orphan is too small to provide a distinct successor to every starting pattern within an square, from which it follows that some two of the possible starting patterns are twins. Therefore, non-surjectivity implies local non- injectivity. =Injectivity versus local injectivity= Time-space diagram of Rule 90, which has no Garden of Eden despite being non-injective. Each row depicts a configuration, with time progressing downwards. The distinction between injectivity and local injectivity in the theorem is necessary, as there exist cellular automata that are locally injective but not injective. One example is Rule 90, the one-dimensional binary automaton whose update rule replaces each cell's state with the exclusive or of its two neighbors. In this automaton, every state has four predecessors, so it is not injective but also has no Garden of Eden. =With quiescent states= In automata such as Conway's Game of Life, there is a special \\"quiescent\\" state such that a quiescent cell whose neighborhood is entirely quiescent remains quiescent. In this case one may define a \\"finite configuration\\" to be a configuration with only finitely many non-quiescent cells. Any non-locally-injective cellular automaton with a quiescent state has Gardens of Eden that are themselves finite configurations, for instance any finite configuration that contains an orphan. It may also be possible for an automaton to have a finite configuration whose only predecessors are not finite (for instance, in Rule 90, a configuration with a single live cell has this property). However, the Garden of Eden theorem does not characterize the existence of such patterns.; . =In non-Euclidean geometries= In cellular automata defined over tessellations of the hyperbolic plane, or of higher-dimensional hyperbolic spaces, the counting argument in the proof of the Garden of Eden theorem does not work, because it depends implicitly on the property of Euclidean spaces that the boundary of a region grows less quickly than its volume as a function of the radius. There exist hyperbolic cellular automata that have twins but that do not have a Garden of Eden, and other hyperbolic cellular automata that have a Garden of Eden but do not have twins; these automata can be defined, for instance, in a rotation-invariant way on the uniform hyperbolic tilings in which three heptagons meet at each vertex, or in which four pentagons meet at each vertex.. Margenstern credits the result jointly to himself and Jarkko Kari. However, the Garden of Eden theorem can be generalized beyond Euclidean spaces, to cellular automata defined on the elements of an amenable group.; ; . A weaker form of the Garden of Eden theorem asserts that every injective cellular automaton is surjective. It can be proven for sofic groups using the Ax‚ÄìGrothendieck theorem, an analogous relation between injectivity and bijectivity in algebraic geometry. More generally, the groups for which this weaker form holds are called surjunctive groups. There are no known examples of groups that are not surjunctive.  In fiction  In Greg Egan's novel Permutation City, the protagonist uses a Garden of Eden configuration to create a situation in which a copy of himself can prove that he is living within a simulation. Previously all his simulated copies had found themselves in some variant of the \\"real world\\"; although they had memories of being simulated copies living in a simulation, there was always a simpler explanation for how those memories came to be. The Garden of Eden configuration, however, cannot occur except in an intelligently designed simulation. The religious parallels are intentional.; .

This arrangement was well suited to the N1s' intended purpose, which was as a heavy drag freight engine for coal and iron ore traffic to and from lakeside ports. The design was developed by the PRR's Fort Wayne Shops and orders were placed with Alco (Brooks) (35 locomotives) and Baldwin (25 locomotives) for a total of 60; the first Alco locomotive was delivered in December 1918, with the remainder arriving during 1919.

The N1s' boiler was larger, but of a lower pressure. The I1s' tractive effort was a little higher, while the N1s had a superior factor of adhesion. The N1s, as a low-speed drag hauler, was limited to , while the I1s was capable of or greater. The N1s were the first class of large power withdrawn after diesel locomotives appeared; all were gone by 1950, and none were saved for display. Their task, low-speed drag haulage, was the diesel locomotive's forte.

In the 21st century, their population stands at 2,000. The Chitty/Chetti community, or Chettiar community, is from South India and are devout Hindus. Language Like the Peranakans, the Chitty speak a Malay patois, which is mixed with many Tamil loan words. Many of the Chitty are unable to communicate in Tamil fluently. History Chitty Museum in Melaka. Historical records stated that the Tamil traders from Panai in Tamil Nadu settled down in Melaka during the sovereignty of the Sultanate of Malacca. Like the Peranakans, they later settled down and freely intermingled with the local Malays and Chinese settlers. However, with the fall of the Malacca Sultanate after 1511, the Chitty eventually lost touch with their native land. Under the administration of the Portuguese, Dutch and British colonizers, the Chitty eventually began simplifying their culture and customs by adopting local customs. This can be evidenced in the architecture of the Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple, which was built by Thaivanayagam Pillay, the leader of the Chitty people, in 1781 after the Dutch colonial government gave him a plot of land. The traditional Chitty settlement is located at Kampung Tujuh along Jalan Gajah Berang, which is also inhabited by a small number of Chinese and Malays as well. Many of the Chitty have since found jobs in Singapore and other parts of Malaysia. The ethnic identity of the Chitty is nearly lost. As many of them are assimilating into the mainstream Indian, Chinese, and Malay ethnic communities culturally, this small but distinct group of people that has survived for centuries is now on the brink of extinction. Exhibition of Peranakan Chitty history, antiques and culture can be seen at the Chitty Museum in Chitty Village, Melaka, Malaysia. Recently in 2013, there were controversies of development at the expense of demolishing part of Kampung Chitty, a historical and cultural village. A proposal to construct a condominium, a hotel and a road cutting through the village are seen as a threat affecting the residents and a temple built in 1827. Religion Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple in Melaka. The Chitty are a tightly knit community of Saivite Hindus, worshipping in their three temples. Gods such as Ganesha and Shiva are worshipped in full gaiety. Hints of Taoist and Islamic influences are also evident in their religious rituals. As staunch believers of the Hindu faith, the Melakan Chitty community still upholds their religious ceremonies. They observe Deepavali, Ponggal, the Hindu New Year, Navratri and other traditional Hindu festivals that are celebrated by Hindu groups in Malaysia. However, the Chitty do not participate in Thaipusam in at a grand level like most Hindu groups. During the month of May they have a similar festival to Thaipusam in their local temple called Mengamay. One celebration that is unique to the Chitty community is the Parchu festival. It is celebrated twice a year with Parchu Ponggal (Bhogi) observed the day before Ponggal in January and Parchu Buah-buahan during the fruit season between June and July. Culture Chitty Village in Melaka. Culturally, the Chitty have largely assimilated into the Malay culture with some Chinese, Dutch and Portuguese influences, although certain elements of Indian culture do remain. This is especially true in the case of marriages, where offerings of fruits and burning of incense are used. In the case of food, Malay spices, ingredients and the way of cooking have largely supplanted the Indian style. Chinese cultural influence is also evident, especially in the case of ancestral worship. Religious objects used for conducting rituals were also used by the Chinese. The Chitty are also influenced by the Chinese to some extent in their ceramics works of art. Simplification of Tamil architecture among the Chitty is also present. Distinct from the Tamil, who have a complex Dravidian Temple Architecture in the Pallava style, that displays beautifully carved out sculptures of the Hindu gods in many rows, the Chitty temple tend to only have one row of these, or a picture of one single god in each of the three rows, as evidenced in the Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple, built by Thaivanayagam Chitty in 1781. Dress and lifestyle Most of the Chitty have adopted the Malay costume. In the case of men, a comfortable sarong and Malay shirt may be worn, although a songkok may also be worn. Women, on the other hand, wear a similar costume that are similar to the Peranakan Nonya. Alongside their Chinese and Malay neighbours, the Chitty live in Kampong houses. Pictures of Hindu gods and Indian names can be seen just outside their houses, as their descendants tend to adopt Indian, rather than Malay surnames. A typical Chitty home is distinctly marked by mango leaves arranged in a row, dangling from above the front door. Chitty temples are also adorned this way. This is the old tradition still followed in Tamil Nadu from ancient period during functions.

Early years  Vllasi was born in Robovac, Kosovska Kamenica, Yugoslavia, in today's Kosovo. In his youth and student years, Vllasi chaired a number of youth organizations: the student league of Kosovo and of Yugoslavia, and from 1974, the League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia. As socialist youth chairman, he became popular and gained the support of President Tito, which helped him to become the first re-elected youth leader. After graduation, he became a lawyer before joining big politics. In 1980, he publicly challenged the autocratic ruler of Albania, Enver Hoxha,RAD Background Report/325;http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/85-3-38.shtml claiming that ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia were better off than people in Albania and describing his rule as brutal and dictatorial. Azem Vllasi was a Chevening Scholarship holder in early 1970s and studied at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. http://www.chevening.org/partners/universities/cambridge  Leader of Kosovo and dismissal  Later on, Vllasi became a member of the central committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and became the leader of the League of Communists of Kosovo in 1986, and the president of Kosovo. Under Vllasi, the Albanian-led Party took a more assertive position towards the Serbian government, and could be expected to put up strong opposition to any moves to reassert Serbian authority over Kosovo. The autonomous province of Kosovo at the time had an equal vote in the federal presidency of Yugoslavia with the Yugoslav republics, and its own executive body, legislature, and judiciary. In November 1988, Azem Vllasi and Kaqusha Jashari, as the two top-ranked Kosovo politicians, were toppled in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution because of their unwillingness to accept the constitutional amendments curbing Kosovo's autonomy, and replaced by appointees of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, the leader of the League of Communists of Serbia at the time. In response to this, the local population started a series of public demonstrations and a general strike, particularly the 1989 Kosovo miners' strike. A partial state of emergency in Kosovo was declared on February 27, 1989, and the newly appointed leaders resigned on February 28. Soon thereafter, Kosovo's legislature, under a threat of force authorised by the federal presidency, acquiesced and passed the amendments allowing Serbia to assert its authority over Kosovo. Vllasi was arrested by the police on the charges of \\"counter-revolutionary activities\\". He was released from the Toƒçak prison in Titova Mitrovica in April 1990.  Today  Vllasi survived the war years and works today as a lawyer, author, and political adviser/consultant. He is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Kosovo (PSDK). In December 2005, Kosovo's prime minister Bajram Kosumi appointed Vllasi as special adviser for negotiations over the final status of Kosovo. Vllasi also served as a political advisor to Kosovo's prime minister Agim √áeku. Vllasi is married to Nadira Avdiƒá-Vllasi, a Bosniak journalist. They have two children, Adem, a practicing attorney in the United States, and Selma, a medical practitioner who also lives and works in the United States.

Featuring distinctly Chinese cultural elements, Chinatown has had a historically concentrated ethnic Chinese population. Chinatown is considerably less of an enclave than it once was. However, the precinct does retain significant historical and cultural significance. Large sections of it have been declared national heritage sites officially designated for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Etymology Aerial perspective of Chinatown. Taken from Club Street. October 2018. Aerial perspective of Singapore's Chinatown Topdown look of a carpark near Club Street Bukit Pasoh Road is located on a hill that in the 1830s marked the western boundary of the colonial town. Singapore's Chinatown is known as Niu che shui () in Mandarin, Gu Chia Chwi in Hokkien and Ngau-che- shui in Cantonese - all of which mean \\"bullock water-cart\\" - and Kreta Ayer in Malay (Post-1972 spelling: \\"kereta air\\"), which means \\"water cart\\". This is due to the fact that Chinatown's water supply was principally transported by animal-driven carts in the 19th century. Although these names are sometimes used for referring to Chinatown in general, they actually refer to the area of Kreta Ayer Road. Geography Chinatown consists of four distinctive sub- areas which were developed at different times. *Telok Ayer - developed in the 1820s. *Kreta Ayer - developed in the 1830s *Bukit Pasoh - developed in early 1900s *Tanjong Pagar - developed in the 1920s Chinatown Complex is located along Smith Street, which was known colloquially as hei yuan kai (theatre street) in Cantonese because of its famous Cantonese opera theatre Lai Chun Yuen, which opened in 1887 to cater to the Cantonese community there, drawing large crowds during the 1910s and 1920s (Nasir, 2005). History =Development = Keong Saik Road was once a red light area in Chinatown in the 1960s, but has since been transformed into a street with many boutique hotels. Wang Dayuan visited Singapore (then called Temasek) in 1330 and recorded that there was a Chinese community. Under the Raffles Plan of Singapore, the area originally was a division of colonial Singapore where Chinese immigrants tended to reside. Although as Singapore grew, Chinese immigrants settled in other areas of the island-city, Chinatown became overcrowded within decades of Singapore's founding in 1819 and remained such until many residents were relocated at the initiation of Singapore's governmental Housing Development Board in the 1960s. In 1822, Sir Stamford Raffles wrote to Captain C. E. Davis, President of the Town Committee, and George Bonham and Alex L. Johnson, Esquires, and members, charging them with the task of \\"suggesting and carrying into effect such arrangements on this head, as may on the whole be most conducive to the comfort and security of the different classes of inhabitants and the general interests and welfare of the place...\\" He went on to issue instructions, as a guide to the Committee, which included a general description of Singapore Town, the ground reserved by the government, the European town and principal mercantile establishments and the native divisions and \\"kampungs\\". These included areas for Bugis, Arabs, Indians, Malays and Chinese kampungs. Raffles was very clear in his instructions and his guidelines were to determine the urban structure of all subsequent development. The \\"five-foot way\\", for example, the continuous covered passage on either side of the street, was one of the public requirements. Raffles foresaw the fact that \\"it may be presumed that they (the Chinese) will always form by far the largest portion of the community\\". For this reason, he appropriated all of the land southwest of the Singapore River for their accommodation but, at the same time, insisted that the different classes and the different provinces be concentrated in their separate quarters and that these quarters, in the event of fire, be constructed of masonry with tiled roofs. This thus resulted in the formation of a distinct section titled Chinatown. However, only when parcels of land were leased or granted to the public in and after 1843 for the building of houses and shophouses, did Chinatown's physical development truly begin. =Legacy= Kreta Ayer Road is the road that defines for Chinese, the Chinatown area. In the 1880s, Kreta Ayer was the red light area in Chinatown. The legacy of cultural diversity in Chinatown is still present. The Hokkiens (Fukiens) are associated with Havelock Road, Telok Ayer Street, China Street and Chulia Street, and the Teochew merchants are mostly in Circular Road, River Valley Road, Boat Quay and South Bridge Road. The ubiquitous Cantonese are scattered around South Bridge Road, Upper Cross Street, New Bridge Road and Bukit Pasoh Road. These days, the Hokkiens and Teochews have largely scattered to other parts of the island, leaving the Cantonese as the dominant dialect group in Chinatown. The Chinese names of Pickering Street are Kian Keng Khau (mouth of the gambling houses) or Ngo Tai Tiahn Hok Kiong Khau (mouth of the five generations of the Tian Hok Temple). There are also several prominent century-old Chinese temples like Hokkien Thian Hock Keng Temple at Telok Ayer Street, Teochew Wak Hai Cheng Bio Temple at Phillips Street, Siang Cho Keong Temple at Amoy Street, Seng Wong Beo Temple at Peck Seah Street and Cantonese Cundhi Gong Temple at Keong Siak Road. Guilds, clans, trade unions and associations were all referred to as kongsi, a kind of Chinese mafia, although the literal meaning of the word is \\"to share\\". The so-called mafia is better translated as the secret and sinister hui. However, these secret societies, the triads, who themselves had suffered under the Qing dynasty in China, provided support to the later immigrants to Singapore by paying their passage and permitting to pay it off by working. There were the letter writers of Sago Street‚Äîthe Chinese called this street Gu Chia Chwi Hi Hng Cheng (front of Kreta Ayer Theatre), but it was mainly associated with life and death ‚Äî the sandalwood idols of Club Street and the complicated and simple food of Mosque Street; all rang to the sound of the abacus. Old women could be seen early in the mornings topping and tailing bean sprouts, the skins of frogs being peeled, the newly killed snakes being skinned and the centuries-old panaceas being dispensed by women blessed with the power of healing. In the heart of this diverse Chinese community is an important temple for Singaporean Tamils, the Sri Mariamman Hindu Tamil Temple, and also mosques, Al-Abrar Mosque at Telok Ayer Street and Jamae Mosque at Mosque Street. These places of worship catered to the pockets of non-Chinese residents in the area and shows that despite efforts to segregate the early immigrants, they had no qualms living peacefully together, and side by side. Street name origins * Mosque Street is named after Jamae Mosque, located on the South Bridge Road end of the street. The mosque was completed in 1830 by the Chulia Muslims from the Coromandel coast of South India but also used by the Malay Muslims living in the area. In the early years, Mosque Street was the site of ten stables. * Pagoda Street takes its name from the Sri Mariamman Temple. During the 1850s and 1880s, the street was one of the centres of slave traffic. It also had its share of coolie quarters and opium smoking dens. One of the traders was Kwong Hup Yuen who, it is thought, occupied No. 37, and after whom Pagoda Street is often referred to today. * Sago Lane and Sago Street got their name because in the 1840s there were a number of sago factories located there. Sago is taken from the pith of the rumbia palm and made into flour that is used for making cakes both sweet and savoury. Funerary businesses were formerly prominent on Sago Lane. * Smith Street was probably named after Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, who was the Governor of the Straits Settlements between 1887 and 1893. * Temple Street refers to the Sri Mariamman Temple, which is located at the South Bridge Road end of the street. It was formerly known as Almeida Street after Joaquim d'Almeida, son of Jos√© D'Almeida, who owned some land at the junction of Temple Street and Trengganu Street. In 1908, the Municipal Commissioners changed its name to Temple Street to avoid confusion with other streets in Singapore which were also named after D'Almeida. * Trengganu Street, described as \\"the Piccadilly of Chinese Singapore\\" in the past, now forms the heart of the tourist belt in Chinatown. In Chinese, it is called gu chia chui wah koi, or \\"the cross street of Kreta Ayer\\". The crossing of streets refers to Smith Street and Sago streets. The street name is derived from Terengganu, a state in present-day Peninsular Malaysia. Architecture Mosque Street is named after Jamae Mosque, located on the South Bridge Road end of the street. The street architecture of Chinatown's buildings, the shophouses especially, combine different elements of baroque architecture and Victorian architecture and do not have a single classification. Many of them were built in the style of painted ladies, and have been restored in that fashion. These styles result in a variety of different colours of which pastel is most dominant. Trengganu Street, Pagoda Street and Temple Street are such examples of this architecture, as well as development in Upper Cross Street and the houses in Club Street. Boat Quay was once a slave market along the Singapore River, Boat Quay has the most mixed-style shophouses on the island. In 1843, when land titles were issued, the terraces in Pagoda Street (now with additions, mostly three-story) were born. They were originally back to back, an arrangement which made night soil collection difficult, but lanes were developed in between following the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) backlane orders of 1935. The architectural character of many of the terraces in Chinatown is much more Italianate in style than those of, for instance Emerald Hill or Petain Road. Windows often appear as mere slits with narrow timber jalousies (often with adjustable slats). Fanlights over the windows are usually quite decorative and the pilasters and balconies and even the plasterwork and colours seem to be Mediterranean in flavour. The style was probably introduced by those early Chinese immigrants (both China-born and Straits-born) who had knowledge of the Portuguese architecture of Macau, Malacca and Goa. The Chettiars and Tamils from Southern India would also have been familiar with the European architecture there, although it is difficult to imagine how these people would have had a particularly strong influence on building in Chinatown. Transportation The Mass Rapid Transit MRT serves the area at Chinatown MRT station on the North East and Downtown Lines, in the middle of pedestrian-only Pagoda Street, and serves the vicinity, as well as several public bus routes which integrates it into Singapore's transportation system. Nearby are the Tanjong Pagar MRT station on the East West MRT Line; Outram Park MRT station, an interchange between the East West Line and North East Line; and Clarke Quay MRT station on the North East Line, as well as a bus terminal called Kampong Bahru Bus Terminal. Politics Chinatown is divided between two Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs), Tanjong Pagar and Jalan Besar, in terms of representation in Parliament. Singapore's first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, was a Member of Parliament representing Tanjong Pagar GRC before his death in March 2015. After the September 2015 general election, Indranee Rajah now represents that part of Tanjong Pagar GRC. The Chinatown area that is part of Jalan Besar GRC is represented by Josephine Teo since 2020, following the retirement of Lily Neo after serving 23 years of politics from 1997.  Activity  The shophouses were home to \\"death houses\\" until 1961, when death houses were banned, and brothels until 1930, when the Women and Girl's Protection Ordinance was enacted, bringing the prostitution situation under control. To cater to those who visited brothels, or participated in extended affairs of Chinese funerals or came to frequent the opera theatre, street hawkers, food stalls and traders selling household goods occupied the streets. In order to address overcrowding and poor living conditions in the city, all street hawkers were relocated into the newly built Kreta Ayer Complex in 1983, which is today's Chinatown Complex.

Etymology and history Jalan Besar only appeared in the 1880s, when the Municipality constructed it through nipah land and called it Jalan Besar, meaning \\"big or wide road\\" in Malay. The area belonged to Richard Owen Norris from the 1830s to 1865, before he moved to Paya Lebar. Later, Syed Allie (1814-1858) bought 70 acres of land in this area and filled in what was predominantly swamp land. The site where Beatty School was and the HDB flats are was a big expanse of open ground. A rubber factory stood on the field, and another in Kitchener Road. The place was full of snipes and a favourite haunt of hunters. The other side of Jalan Besar between Lavender Street and Syed Alwi Road was swamp land. Flying ducks, snipe, fish, mud lobsters and multi-coloured snakes thrived there. The area was slowly reclaimed by dumping refuse. In 1923, the New World Amusement Park located off Jalan Besar was opened by the enterprising sons of Ong Sam Leong (after whom nearby Sam Leong Road is named), Peng Hock and Boon Tat. A peculiarity of the street names in Jalan Besar is that many bear the names of World War I British generals and admirals and two French generals ‚Äî Allenby, Kitchener, French, Maude, Jellicoe, Tyrwhitt, Foch, Sturdee, Beatty and Petain. The names of battle places such as Flanders, Somme and Verdun are also reflected. Today, Jalan Besar is a gazetted conservation area. Most of the roads above were cut from the 1920s onwards when the then-swampland was filled in with incinerator ash from Singapore's first incinerator built in the vicinity of today's Syed Alwi Road. From 1926, the Municipal Council decided to name the newly opened roads after personalities and battle-sites of the European conflict so as to remind the then-colony of Singapore of the conflicts in Europe. The street is known to the Hoklos (Hokkien) as kam kong ka poh thai tu long, which means \\"the slaughter pig depot in Kampong Kapor\\", a reference to the abattoir in the vicinity. Other uses \\"Jalan Besar\\" is also a common street name in Malaysia used as an occasional substitute for the colonially named \\"Main Street\\" and \\"Main Road\\", as part of the country's increased use of Malay over English. The name is prevalent in individual towns that formerly featured their own set of street names representing main thoroughfares and streets related to specific landmarks.

Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Harry and Yetta (Lesser) Kitz, he grew up with older sister Hildred Kitz (Silver) and younger brother Joe. He attended Halifax's Protestant school system (there being no state-supported school for non-Christians) and graduated from the Halifax Academy. He attended Dalhousie University, where he studied law, graduating from Dalhousie Law School in 1938. With World War II breaking out in Europe in 1939, Kitz joined the Canadian Army becoming an infantry officer in the Princess Louise Fusiliers. During the war, he served in Italy and Holland. After the war he served as a lawyer in military tribunals. While serving in England in 1945, Kitz met and married Dr. Alice Duff Findlay. The two returned to Halifax after the war where Kitz opened his own law firm, located on Granville Street. His law firm was eventually joined by Robert Matheson becoming Matheson and Kitz. Kitz served as President of the Nova Scotia Barristers Association from 1968-1969. In 1948, Kitz decided to enter politics and he was elected an alderman in Halifax. He served as an alderman from 1948-1955. Kitz is most remembered for his part as the 'driving force' behind the funding and construction of a statue of Winston Churchill which is a landmark on Halifax's Spring Garden Road. Kitz was re-elected in 1956, but two years later, he resigned the mayorship to run, unsuccessfully, as a Liberal for parliament in the federal riding of Halifax. He was one of the founders of the city's most prestigious independent school, The Halifax Grammar School, opened in 1958. Kitz' first wife died in 1969. He remarried in 1971 to Janet (nee Brownlee) Kitz who became a noted historian of the Halifax Explosion and the author of a number of books on the subject. The couple played an important leadership role in organizing public commemorations of the explosion.Shania Luck, \\"Halifax Explosion Gaining Momentum\\", Chronicle Herald\\" December 6, 2006 References Tribute at the Nova Scotia Barristers Association by Daniel N.

Following Reinhard Heydrich's assassination in 1942, he served as Deputy Protector for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Daluege directed the German measures of retribution for the assassination, including the Lidice massacre. After the end of World War II, he was extradited to Czechoslovakia, tried, convicted and executed in 1946. Early life and career Daluege, son of a Prussian state official, was born in the small Upper Silesian town of Kreuzburg (now Kluczbork) on 15 September 1897. He entered the Prussian Army in 1916 and served with the 7th Guards Infantry Regiment. He served on the Eastern Front. In October 1917, he attended officers training in Doberitz. During his service on the Western Front, he was severely wounded in the head and shoulder. He was hospitalised and declared 25% disabled. Daluege was awarded the Iron Cross, second class (1918) and the Wound Badge in Black (1918). 1920s After World War I, Daluege became leader of Selbstschutz Oberschlesien (SSOS) - Upper Silesian Self Defense ‚Äî an Upper Silesian veterans' organization engaged in combat with the Poles in that region. In 1921, he also became active in the Freikorps Rossbach while studying engineering at the Technical University in Berlin, where he eventually earned a civil engineering degree. Two years later he joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and was assigned Party number 31,981. He also joined the Greater German Workers' Party in the same year.Friedrich, Thomas (2013) Hitler's Berlin: Abused City Spencer, Stewart (trans). New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press. . pp. 68‚Äì69 From 1924, he helped to organize the Berlin Frontbann, largely a front organization for the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA), since it and the Nazi Party were banned in Prussia at that time. In 1926 he joined the SA directly, eventually becoming both the leader of Berlin's SA and Joseph Goebbels' deputy (Gauleiter, or Party leader) in Berlin. Throughout the period of 1926‚Äî1929, Daluege led the Berlin- Brandenburg division of the SA. SS and police leader Daluege in 1933 In July 1930, in accordance with Hitler's wishes, Daluege resigned from the SA and joined the SS with the rank of SS-Oberf√ºhrer and membership number 1,119. His main responsibility was to spy on the SA and political opponents of the Nazi Party. Berlin SS headquarters was strategically placed at the corner of L√ºtzowstrasse and Potsdamerstrasse, opposite the SA headquarters. In August 1930, when Berlin SA leader Walter Stennes had his men attack the Berlin Party headquarters, it was Daluege's SS men who defended it and put the attack down. Sometime afterwards in an open letter to Daluege, Adolf Hitler proclaimed \\"SS Mann, deine Ehre hei√üt Treue!\\" (\\"SS man, your honour is loyalty\\"). Then, the slogan \\"Meine Ehre hei√üt Treue\\" (My honour is loyalty) was duly adopted by the SS as its motto. Hitler promoted both Daluege and Heinrich Himmler to SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer, with Daluege the SS leader of northern Germany while Himmler controlled the southern SS units out of Munich in addition to serving as national leader for the entire SS. In 1932 Daluege became a Nazi Party delegate in the Prussian state Parliament, and in November 1932 was elected to the Reichstag representing the Berlin East electoral district, a seat he retained until 1945. At the same time, Hermann G√∂ring moved Daluege to the Prussian Interior Ministry, where he took over the nonpolitical police with the rank of General der Polizei. Intrigues created by G√∂ring, Himmler and Heydrich surrounding Ernst R√∂hm led to Daluege's playing an important role in the infamous \\"Night of the Long Knives\\". In that operation R√∂hm along with other leading members of the SA were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934, thus neutralizing the SA and shifting the balance of power within the party to the SS.For more details on this event see: H√∂hne (2001). The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS, pp. 93‚Äì131. Evidence of Daluege's ruthlessness goes beyond his intrigue against his former SA comrades, and is discernible in his remarks about anyone he considered a threat to society. He once argued that \\"the consciously asocial enemies of the people (Volksfeinde)\\" must be eliminated by state intervention \\"if it hopes to prevent the outbreak of complete moral degeneration.\\" Historian George Browder claims that Daluege \\"bragged that the Police Institute for detective training had especially been reorganized according to NS viewpoints\\", and that advancement within this organization was contingent to a considerable degree on the internalization of Nazi ideology. By November 1934, Daluege's authority over the uniformed police was extended beyond Prussia to include all of Germany. That meant he commanded municipal police forces, the rural gendarmerie, traffic police, the coastguard, the railway police, the postal protection service, fire brigades, the air-raid services, the emergency technical service, the broadcasting police, the factory protection police, building regulations enforcement, and the commercial police. Daluege (right) in Cracow in 1939, shaking hands with Heinrich Himmler (left). Hans Frank (center) stands between them. In 1936, the entire German police force was reorganized with the administrative functions previously exercised by the now largely defunct federal states reassigned to the nominal control of the Reich Interior Ministry, but under the actual control of Himmler's SS. Making the most of his police expertise and coinciding with his appointment, Daluege wrote and published a book entitled National-sozialistischer Kampf gegen das Verbrechertum (NS Struggle against Criminality). That same year, Himmler appointed Daluege as chief of the Ordnungspolizei (ORPO), which gave him administrative, though not executive, authority over most of the uniformed police in Nazi Germany. He commanded the ORPO until 1943, rising to the rank of SS-Oberst-Gruppenf√ºhrer und Generaloberst der Polizei. Reinhard Heydrich, who took control of the SIPO (Security Police) at the same time that Daluege took control of the ORPO, thought very little of Daluege, as he was a former rival in the early struggle for power, and was contemptuously referred to by Heydrich as 'Dummi-Dummi', or 'the idiot'. By August 1939, the strength of the ORPO under Daluege's command and control had reached upwards of 120,000 active-duty personnel.\\"Vortrag ueber die Deutsche Ordnungspolizei, Gehalten am 2.

Westermann, \\"Friend and Helper: German uniformed police operations in Poland and the general government, 1939‚Äì1941\\", The Journal of Military History 58 no.4 (Oct 1994): 643. Further indications of the brutality coming from Daluege's office (Chief of the Ordnungspolizei), are shown in a report dated 5 September 1939, outlining the methods to be employed during pacification operations in Poland. Regarding uniformed police battalions for planned reprisal actions around the Polish town of Czestochowa, the report gave the following instructions: \\"[t]he leader of this battalion is ordered to take the most drastic actions and measures such as those in the upper Silesian industrial area, the hanging of Polish franc-tireurs from light poles as a visible symbol for the entire population.\\"\\"Der Chef der Ordnungspolizei, Berlin, den 5.

Westermann, \\"Friend and Helper: German uniformed police operations in Poland and the general government, 1939‚Äì1941\\", The Journal of Military History 58 no.4 (Oct 1994): 643. During the war in 1941, he attended a mass shooting of 4,435 Jews by Police Battalion 307 near Brest-Litowsk and a mass shooting of Jews in Minsk. Furthermore, in October 1941 Daluege signed deportation orders for Jews from Germany, Austria and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, to Riga and Minsk. On 7 July 1942, he attended a conference led by Himmler which discussed the \\"enlargement\\" of Operation Reinhard, the secretive Nazi plan to mass-murder Polish Jews in the General Government district of occupied Poland, and other matters involving SS and police policies in the east. Massacre of Lidice Memorial in the Czech Republic to children of Lidice murdered on Daluege's orders In 1942 Daluege became the Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, following the assassination of Deputy Protector Reinhard Heydrich. There seemed to be little logic behind Hitler appointing Daluege beyond the fact that he was a senior SS officer and was already in Prague at the time, where he had arrived on the day of Heydrich's assassination for medical treatment. Hitler originally wanted to appoint Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski but Himmler persuaded Hitler not to do so, arguing that Bach-Zelewski could not be spared because of the military situation on the Eastern front. Although Konstantin von Neurath was nominally Protector he had been stripped of his authority in 1941, so Daluege was Acting Protector in all but name. In June 1942, along with Karl Hermann Frank and other SS operatives, he ordered the villages of Lidice and Le≈æ√°ky razed to the ground in reprisal for Heydrich's death. All the men in both villages were murdered, while many of the women and children were deported to Nazi concentration camps. Personal life On 16 October 1926, Daluege married K√§the Schwarz (born 23 November 1901) who later became a member of the Nazi Party (member no. 118,363). In 1937, Daluege and his wife adopted a son. Afterwards, Daluege's wife bore three biological children, two sons born in 1938 and 1940 and a daughter born in 1942. In May 1943, Daluege became seriously ill after a massive heart attack. In August, he was relieved of all of his day-to-day responsibilities and spent the rest of the war living on a property in western Pomerania, given to him by Hitler. Arrest, trial, conviction and sentence In May 1945, Daluege was arrested by British troops in L√ºbeck and interned in Luxembourg and then at Nuremberg, where he was charged as \\"a major war criminal\\". In September 1946 after being extradited to Czechoslovakia, he was tried for his many crimes against humanity committed in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Throughout his trial, Daluege was unrepentant, claiming he was beloved by \\"three million policemen\\", only following Hitler's orders and had a clear conscience. He was convicted on all charges and sentenced to death on 23 October 1946. Daluege was hanged using the traditional Czech pole method in Pankr√°c prison in Prague on 24 October 1946.Some sources state he was hanged on 23 October 1946.

Career =Councillor and Mayor of Bedford= Kelly began his political career in the former town of Bedford as a municipal councillor elected in 1985., CBC News, September 11, 2012 He was elected Mayor of Bedford in 1991. =Mayor of Halifax Regional Municipality= Kelly was the second mayor of HRM, defeating the incumbent, Walter Fitzgerald, in 2000.Simpson, Jeffrey, \\"Kelly romps in HRM.\\" Halifax-Chronicle Herald, October 22, 2000. He was re-elected in 2004Pugsley-Fraser, Amy, \\"Kelly wins in landslide.\\" Halifax- Chronicle Herald, October 17, 2004. and 2008.\\"Kelly wins 3rd term as Halifax mayor\\". CBC News, October 19, 2008. Kelly was the longest-serving mayor of Halifax Regional Municipality, being elected in 2000 then re-elected in 2004 and 2008. During Kelly's time as mayor, the region installed a large and long- delayed sewage treatment system known as Halifax Harbour Solutions which came into operation in 2008, broke down and was restored in 2010. Kelly was criticized for the failure of the city's Harbour Solutions sewage treatment plant which had faced delays and breakdowns.\\"Halifax mayor takes 'full responsibility' [sic] for sewage treatment failure\\". CBC News, June 19, 2009. During this time the municipality attracted several large profile national events such as the 2011 Canada Winter Games and some international events such as Tall Ships visits. A popular outcome of the Canada Winter Games was the conversion of the temporary speed skating oval into a permanent facility for speed skating and outdoor public skating. In 2007, Kelly withdrew Halifax's bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games over concerns about the rapidly escalating costs of the games.\\"Halifax Drops out of Commonwealth Games\\", CBC News, March 8, 2007. He was instrumental in allowing a controversial $400,000 loan of public money for a Black Eyed Peas concert in 2010 which was not approved by HRM council or reviewed by the city's legal department. The loan was not repaid when the promoter went out of business.\\"Kelly staying, Anstey leaving\\". The Chronicle Herald, March 16, 2011. Retrieved March 22, 2011.

The Coast, June 8, 2011. the region's Auditor General found serious problems with the decision-making process and book-keeping for the concert loan to Power Promotional Events. The city was eventually able to recover much of the loan but is still owed approximately $359,550 from the deal. During Kelly's tenure the municipality adopted a new regional development plan in 2006 and an urban development plan for Downtown Halifax known as \\"Halifax By Design\\" in 2009. In November 2011, the city approved and began a long-delayed construction of a new central public library. Peter Kelly pushed for an expansion of a community centre in the nation's largest African Canadian community of North Preston. Along with the community centre in North Preston, Kelly's administration saw the construction of seven fire halls, five recreational complexes, the World Trade and Convention Centre. Also, he saw the construction of the Halifax Central Library. Kelly apologized on behalf of the municipality for the razing of Africville, backing it up was a $5 million reparation plan for the black community, of which $3 million was paid by the city. In 2011 a commemorative church and interpretive centre was constructed as part of, what is now called the Africville Apology.\\"Halifax apologizes for razing Africville\\". CBC News, February 24, 2010. Late in Kelly's final term in office the municipality began the process of removal of the Cogswell Interchange. Kelly's role in the eviction of the NS Occupy Protests on Remembrance Day 2011 caused controversy. Occupy protesters agreed to temporarily move out of Halifax's Grand Parade for the Remembrance Day ceremony and shifted their camp to Victoria Park. Kelly stated that he supported and respected the cooperation of protesters, offering an alternative location for the protest camp, but also supported the eviction and arrest of 14 protesters just minutes after the close of the Remembrance Day ceremonies.\\"Occupy protesters to move for Remembrance Day\\". CBC News, October 31, 2011.\\"Occupy N.S. protesters plan next move after eviction\\". CBC News, November 11, 2011. The eviction was approved by HRM council in a closed-door meeting chaired by Kelly on November 8. The decision to evict the protesters on a holiday weekend cost Halifax taxpayers an extra $106,000 in overtime costs.\\"More than $100K Spent to Evict Occupy NS\\", Global Maritimes, November 15, 2011. In response to charges that the city betrayed the trust of an agreement between the city, veterans and Occupy NS, Kelly stated that the decision was up to council and the eviction was an operational police matter.\\"Interview with Mayor Peter Kelly on Occupy eviction\\". The Chronicle Herald, November 11, 2011. =Executor of the will of Mary Thibeault= Kelly is also criticized for his performance as the executor of the will of 91-year- old Mary Thibeault. Kelly was appointed as executor by Nova Scotia's probate court as requested in Thibeault's will. He was one of 18 heirs to the estate of about half a million dollars. The heirs which included several elderly people and charities waited eight years for the estate to be resolved, a process that usually takes 18 months.\\"A trust betrayed: Peter Kelly and the estate of Mary Thibeault\\". The Coast, February 16, 2012. In June 2012 five of 18 beneficiaries had petitioned the province's probate court to have Kelly removed as executor\\"Halifax mayor to step down as estate executor\\", CBC News, September 19, 2012 alleging he had taken nearly $150,000 from the estatePeter Kelly no-shows at court, agrees to step down as executor of woman‚Äôs estate, The Metro, September 18, 2012 and that the will was still not settled seven years after Thibeault's death.\\"The Honest Truth\\" Halifax Examiner, September 5, 2014 In September 2012 the issue was resolved when Kelly agreed to step down after probate judge ordered him removed as Thibeault's executor.\\"Kelly settles with Thibeault heirs\\".

In July 2014 Kelly went to work with former mayor's office staffer Stephen Taylor as a partner in Target Pest control, working in business development., CBC News, July 2, 2014 =CAO of Westlock County= Westlock County, Alberta announced September 2, 2014 that after a Canada wide search it had hired Kelly as the county's new CAO.\\"Peter Kelly, former Halifax mayor, has new job in Alberta\\", CBC News, September 4, 2014. The Mayor of Westlock County stated that while he and county council had been aware of previous controversies from Kelly's tenure as Mayor of Halifax, they still felt Kelly was \\"the right choice.\\" For his part, Kelly was unconcerned that the perception of financial impropriety might interfere in his new job, saying \\"I have never taken any public money. I'm very honest. I'm very careful of my reputation and I try to make sure I protect it all costs. When it comes to public funds in this particular municipality, I will do whatever I can to make sure we maximize the dollars.\\"\\"County hires former Halifax mayor as CAO\\" , Westlock News, September 4, 2014. Kelly served in this position until March 2016, leaving to become CAO of Charlottetown, PEI. On July 7, 2016, Westlock County chief financial officer Sue Oberg told council that Kelly had approved $390,570 in un-budgeted expenses while CAO. The money was spent to develop a site in the North Horizon industrial park. Alberta's Municipal Government Act allows council to determine how much spending a CAO is allowed to approve without council approval, which in Westlock County was $10,000.\\"Peter Kelly 'acted outside his authority' as CAO in Alberta, report concludes\\", CBC News, August 31, 2017. In his defence Kelly stated that he relied on the information provided by public works department staff to make his decisions, and the work on the lot was outlined in a lease agreement passed by council.\\"'A selective witch hunt': Peter Kelly responds to critical report\\", CBC News, September 1, 2017 On August 10, 2016 it was reported that the Westlock County Council had voted to ask the Alberta Department of Municipal Affairs to conduct a Municipal Inspection regarding issues around Kelly's role the Horizon North project among others.\\"Alta. begins review of Westlock County and former CAO, now with city of Charlottetown\\", CBC News, August 10, 2016. When completed in July 2017 the report\\"2017 Westlock County Municipal Inspection Report\\" , Strategic Steps, July 11, 2017. concluded Kelly breached the Alberta Municipal Government Act on a number of occasions. He was found to have allegedly shredded documents and worked simultaneously for the county and the City of Charlottetown, and bypassed county managers and directed a clerk to create and cancel invoices. In particular it stated \\"In apparent enthusiasm for economic development, Kelly acted without proper authority and failed to advise council of their legislative responsibilities.\\"\\"Peter Kelly 'acted outside his authority' as CAO in Alberta, report concludes\\", CBC News, August 31, 2017. The report also found that the county under Kelly attempted to use blueprints for constructing Fawcett Fire Hall without respect for copyright. The inspectors stated that it appeared the Baptiste Lake Fire Hall drawing were being used as a cost saving measure to avoid hiring an engineer or architect.\\"County tried to use copyright blueprints for Fawcett Fire Hall inspection finds\\", Westlock News, September 19, 2017. Kelly responded that the report was \\"lacking, disappointing and incomplete at best. Often appearing as inaccurate and biased.\\" Kelly reiterated his position that he was acting on council direction contained in two motions regarding the lease, including one that approved the lease containing a clause in the lease agreement that outlined work to be done by the municipality.\\"'A selective witch hunt': Peter Kelly responds to critical report\\", CBC News, September 1, 2017 Kelly stated that documents were destroyed after he departed Westlock and as a result the investigators relied on interviews and allegations rather than facts.\\"Former CAO calls inspection a witch hunt\\", Westlock News, September 5, 2017. =CAO of Charlottetown= Kelly became CAO in Charlottetown on May 1, 2016.\\"Charlottetown CAO Peter Kelly‚Äôs probation ends, city quiet on status\\" , The Chronicle Herald, June 1, 2017. Speaking of the controversies surrounding Kelly's term as mayor, Clifford Lee, Mayor of Charlottetown, defended the choice, saying \\"I think he did a fantastic job for the citizens of Halifax.\\"\\"Peter Kelly, former mayor of Halifax, to become Charlottetown CAO\\", CBC News, March 29, 2017. Initially, Kelly was hired with a six-month probationary period, which was extended an additional six months when news of the Westlock investigation surfaced.\\"Charlottetown CAO Peter Kelly‚Äôs probation ends, city quiet on status\\" , The Chronicle Herald, June 1, 2017. Employment would be reviewed if he was convicted of violating any law. While retaining Kelly was defended by the Mayor and Councillor MacLeod, then chairing the city's human resource committee,\\"UPDATE: Peter Kelly now a permanent employee of City of Charlottetown\\", The Guardian, June 1, 2017. Councillor Jason Coady expressed concern about the decision to retain Kelly, \\"Coun.

In October 2017 it was reported that Kelly was at the centre of increased labour unrest with city hall workers, who were exploring joining a larger union to better represent themselves. The number of grievances had increased dramatically and several city staffers pointed the finger at Kelly. \\"Staffing strife at Charlottetown city hall; sources point finger at Kelly\\", The Guardian, October 13, 2017. In December 2017 after an investigation by external HR consultants Kelly was found to have breached the Charlottetown's harassment policy. Kelly was found to have breached the policy seven times in relation to complaints brought by City of Charlottetown public works superintendent, including directing an improper investigation into the complainants work, harassment and bullying, and a breach in confidentiality.

It consists largely of private residential areas and a small public housing estate along Lengkong Tiga. Etymology Kembangan means \\"expansion\\" in Malay. The road Jalan Kembangan was officially named in 1932. History Kembangan along with the wider Geylang district was badly hit by the September 1964 race riots and schools in the area had to be closed for an extended period despite other schools in Singapore reopening after the curfew was lifted. Later in the 1980s, the Malay villages of Kampong Kembangan and Kampong Pachitan, which used to stand at present day Kembangan estate, were demolished to make way for redevelopments in the area. Kampong Kembangan lies approximately to the east of the present day HDB flats in the estate, while Kampong Pachitan lie west of the flats. Several roads in the area were removed or realigned with the redevelopments that were in tandem with the construction of the MRT Line and station there. Amenities Kembangan Districts Map Kembangan is served by limited amenities like the Kembangan Plaza, which mainly consists of tuition centres, as well as shophouses around the estate. The social welfare of residents are catered for with facilities like the Kwan-In Welfare Free Clinic and the Moral Home for the Disabled in the area. The estate is served by the Kampong Kembangan Community Club, which also serves the wider Kembangan-Chai Chee constituency in the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency. The Siglap Park Connector which runs to either the Bedok Reservoir Park or the East Coast Park cuts through the area too. There are more amenities located in the nearby Chai Chee and Eunos estates. The area also has multiple places of worship like the Bethesda Chapel, Mangala Vihara Buddhist TempleMangala Vihara Buddhist Temple, Hong San Si Temple (Ê®üÂÆúÂá§Â±±ÂØ∫)Changi Hong San Si Temple, Masjid Abdul Razak, Masjid Mydin and The Buddhist UnionThe Buddhist Union. The area falls under the jurisdiction of the Kampong Kembangan Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP), which is part of the Bedok Police Division, and the 2nd Singapore Civil Defence Force DIV HQ. =Education= There are currently no public government schools in the Kembangan estate. There is only a government funded school, the MINDS Towner Gardens School. It is the first purpose built special education school in Singapore, established since 1985. It has been operating from that location since December 1997. There are also kindergartens like the PCF Kindergarten and the Muhammadiyah Kindergarten located in this estate. There used to be multiple schools in the area some of which are now defunct namely: * Chin Hua School, from before 1936 to c.1970, formerly located at 503A Changi Road * Kembangan Integrated Primary School (KIPS), from 1963 to 1987, formerly located at 2 Lengkong Satu the current site of MINDS School * Madrasah Al- Arabiah Al-Islamiah, it formerly stood at where Muhammadiyah Association is today from c.1980s to 2005 and now stands at its present location in Toa Payoh * Madrasah Alsagoff Al-Arabiah, it occupied the defunct KIPS premises from 1989 to 1992 and now stands at its present location in Kampong Glam * Madrasah Irsyad or Madrasatul Irsyad Al Islamiyah from 1979, it is managed by Masjid Mydin and is not to be confused with the current Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al- Islamiah =Transportation= The estate is served by the East West MRT Line at the Kembangan MRT station. There is only one public bus service (no. 42) serving the area, which also serves the neighbouring Opera Estate. There are more bus services to be found along the one directional Sims Avenue East that lies south of the estate, or the further Changi Road which runs in the opposite direction towards the city. The Pan Island Expressway which lies north of the estate does not have an exit leading into the estate. Incidents * On 5 July 2009, 17 year old Vincent Tan Sze Hao died after being kicked in the neck by his opponent during a sparring session in a taekwondo tournament in Kampong Kembangan Community Club. He as a green belt holder was sparring against a higher ranked brown belt holder. The coroner ruled that it was an unfortunate accident that cannot be blamed upon either the organiser or his opponent. It is the first fatality of taekwondo in Singapore.

Its location roughly corresponds to the similarly titled subzone of Macpherson in the Geylang Planning Area and is approximately sandwiched between the neighbourhoods of Aljunied and Paya Lebar. MacPherson largely consists of a small public housing estate centered on Circuit Road and an industrial area. The neighbourhood is served by the Circle MRT Line and Downtown Line at MacPherson MRT station and Mattar MRT station. Etymology Formerly called Jalan Klapa, MacPherson Road was named after Lieutenant Colonel Ronald MacPherson (1817-1869). MacPherson served in the China War of 1841 and was appointed Staff Officer to the Artillery in the Straits in 1843. He succeeded Colonel H. Man as Executive Engineer and Superintendent of Convicts and Resident Councillor, Malacca in 1855 and 1857 respectively. He had been active in forming a local volunteer corps at the outbreak of the Crimean War and was appointed First Captain Commandment of the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps formed in 1854. When the first Municipal Act came into operation in 1856, he became an ex officio member of the Commission, becoming President on three later occasions. He was appointed the first Colonial Secretary when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony in 1867. MacPherson designed the current St Andrew's Cathedral along the lines of Netley Abbey in England and built it in six years using Indian convict labour. Completed in 1862, the cathedral is considered one of the finest specimens of ecclesiastical architecture in the east. On the cathedral grounds, the architect is commemorated in a memorial called the MacPherson Memorial Monument. He was buried in the old Bukit Timah Road Christian Cemetery, which has since been landscaped and made into a park. The name Macpherson -- or MacPherson or McPherson, according to different spellings -- comes from the Gaelic Mac a' phearsain and means 'Son of the parson'. For some old folks it was called Persiaran Keliling.

Perception and Misperception in International Politics (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1978), pp. 58‚Äì113. The term was coined by the German scholar John H. Herz in his 1951 book Political Realism and Political Idealism. At the same time British historian Herbert Butterfield described the same situation in his History and Human Relations, but referred to it as the \\"absolute predicament and irreducible dilemma\\". In John Herz's words, the security dilemma is \\"A structural notion in which the self-help attempts of states to look after their security needs tend, regardless of intention, to lead to rising insecurity for others as each interprets its own measures as defensive and measures of others as potentially threatening\\".Herz, J. \\"Idealist Internationalism and the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 2, no. 2 (1950): 171‚Äì201, at p. 157 (Published by Cambridge University Press) A frequently cited example of the security dilemma is the beginning of World War I. Supporters of this viewpoint argue that the major European powers felt forced to go to war by feelings of insecurity over alliances of their neighbours despite not actually wanting war. Furthermore, Germany's fear of fighting war on two fronts led it to the formulation of the infamous Schlieffen Plan, which specified a particularly accelerated mobilization timetable. The onset of German mobilization, in turn, put pressure on other states to start mobilizing early as well. However, other scholars dispute this interpretation of the origins of the war, contending that some of the states involved really wanted the conflict. The security dilemma is a popular concept with cognitive and international relations theorists, who regard war as essentially arising from failures of communication. Functionalist theorists affirm that the key to avoiding war is the avoidance of miscommunication through proper signaling. The security dilemma has important relationships with other theories and doctrines of international security. Part of the strength of the security dilemma theory is that it subsumes and is consistent with a number of other theories. Other theories can be considered in terms of the security dilemma. Defensive realism The security dilemma is the core assumption of defensive realism. According to Kenneth Waltz, because the world does not have a common government and is \\"anarchic\\", survival is the main motivation of states. States are distrustful of other states' intentions and as a consequence always try to maximize their own security, which results in the situation of the security dilemma.Baylis, J. and Smith, S. The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations. Oxford University Press, 2005, 3rd ed. Offense-defense theory of defensive realism is a potential theory to explain the level of threat arising from the security dilemma.Lynn-Jones, S.M. \\"Offense-Defense Theory and Its Critics\\", Security Studies vol. 4, no. 4 (Summer 1995): 660‚Äì691 (Published by Frank Cass, London) Defensive realists often regard the success of the United States in World War I as being a result of the defensive approach taken by the United States. Had the United States taken an offensive stance, defensive realists argue that the United States would not have been secure.Walt, S.M. \\"International Relations: One World, Many Theories\\", Foreign Policy No. 110, Special Edition: Frontiers of Knowledge (Spring 1998), pp. 29‚Äì32, 34‚Äì46 (Published by the Slate Group, a division of The Washington Post Company) The conclusion from defensive realism is that in some circumstances states can escape the security dilemma. Offensive realism Offensive realism and defensive realism are variants of structural realism. They share the basic beliefs of survivalism, statism (state as the primary unit), self-help and anarchy. (See international relations theory.) Baylis, J. and Smith, S. The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations. Oxford University Press 2005 3rd ed. However, contrary to defensive realism, offensive realism regards states as aggressive power maximizers and not as security maximizers.Baylis, J. and Smith, S. The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations. Oxford University Press 2005 3rd ed. According to John Mearsheimer, \\"Uncertainty about the intentions of other states is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities\\".Mearsheimer, J. J. The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. New York: Norton, \\"Anarchy and the Struggle for Power\\", Chapter 2 According to Mearsheimer, though achieving hegemony by any state is not likely in today's international system, there is no such thing as a status quo and \\"the world is condemned to perpetual great power competition\\".Mearsheimer, J. J. The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. New York: Norton, \\"Anarchy and the Struggle for Power\\", Chapter 2 On the belief that the international system is anarchic and that each State must independently seek its own survival, Waltz argues that weaker states try to find a balance with their rivals and to form an alliance with a stronger state to obtain a guarantee of security against offensive action by an enemy state. On the other hand, Mearsheimer and other offensive realists argue that Anarchy encourages all states to always increase their own power because one state can never be sure of other states' intentions.Walt, S.M. \\"International Relations: One World, Many Theories\\", Foreign Policy No. 110, Special Edition: Frontiers of Knowledge (Spring 1998), pp. 29‚Äì32, 34‚Äì46 (Published by the Slate Group, a division of The Washington Post Company) In other words, defensive realism contends that security can be balanced in some cases and that the security dilemma is escapable. While offensive realists do not disagree, they do not agree fully with the defensive view instead contending that if states can gain an advantage over other states then they will do so. In short, since states want to maximize their power in this anarchic system and since states cannot trust one another, the security dilemma is inescapable. Offense‚Äìdefense theory The offense‚Äìdefense theory of Robert Jervis helps decide the intensity of the security dilemma. Jervis uses four scenarios to describe the intensity of the security dilemma. * When offensive and defensive behaviour are not distinguishable but offense has an advantage, the security dilemma is \\"very intense\\" and environment is \\"doubly dangerous\\".Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) Status quo states will behave in an aggressive manner and there will arise the possibility of an arms race. Chances of cooperation between states are low.Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) * Where offensive and defensive behavior are not distinguishable but defense has an advantage, the security dilemma is \\"intense\\" in explaining states' behaviour but not as intense as in the first case. In such situation, a state might be able to increase its security without being a threat to other states and without endangering the security of other states.Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) * Where offensive and defensive behavior are distinguishable but offense has an advantage, the security dilemma is \\"not intense\\" but security issues exist. The environment is safe, but offensive behaviour has an advantage that might result in aggression at some future time.Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) * Where offensive and defensive behavior are distinguishable and defense has advantage, the security dilemma has little or no intensity, and the environment is \\"doubly safe\\". Since there is little danger of offensive action by other states, a state would be able to expend some of its defense budget and other resources on useful development within the state.Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) According to Jervis, the technical capabilities of a state and its geographical position are two essential factors in deciding whether offensive or defensive action is advantageous. He argues that at a strategic level, technical and geographical factors are of greater favor to the defender. For example, in the 19th century railway and roads construction were rapidly changing the composition of capabilities of states to attack or defend themselves from other states. Thus, considerable effort in diplomatic relations and intelligence were specifically focused on this issue. The spiral model identifies the next step in reasoning about states' behavior after identifying the intensity of the security dilemma. In particular, under given circumstances of the security dilemma, what steps might a threatened state take to derive advantage by attacking first. In other words, the spiral model seeks to explain war. In the spiral model of Jervis, there are two reasons why a state might end up in war. \\"Preventive war\\" might take place as one state might decide to attack first when it perceives the balance of power shifting to the other side creating an advantage in attacking sooner rather than later as conditions may not be as favorable in the future as in the present. \\"Preemptive war\\" might take place as a state might decide to attack another state first to prevent the other state from attacking or to obstruct the other state's attack because it fears the other state is preparing to attack.Reiter, D. \\"Exploring the Bargaining Model of War\\", Perspectives on Politics 1, 1 (2003): 27‚Äì43 The deterrence model is contrary to the spiral model, but also purports to explain war. While the spiral model presumes that states are fearful of each other, the deterrence model is based on the belief that states are greedy.Reiter, D. \\"Exploring the Bargaining Model of War\\", Perspectives on Politics 1, 1 (2003): 27‚Äì43 Paul K. Huth divides deterrence into three main types: * Preventing armed attack against a country's own territory (\\"direct deterrence\\") * Preventing armed attack against the territory of another country (\\"extended deterrence\\") * Using deterrence against a short-term threat of attack (\\"immediate deterrence\\") \\"Under some circumstances attempts at deterrence can \\"backfire\\" when a potential attacker misinterprets the state's deterrence measures as a \\"prelude to offensive measures\\". In such cases the security dilemma can arise generating perceptions of a \\"first strike advantage\\". According to Huth \\"most effective deterrence policies are those that decrease the expected utility of using force while not reducing the expected utility of the status quo; optimally deterrent policies would even increase the utility of not using the force.\\" It is more likely that deterrence will succeed if the attacker finds deterrence threat \\"credible\\" and a credible deterrence threat might not necessarily be a military threat. Jervis claims that the security dilemma can lead to arms races and alliance formation. =Arms race= According to Robert Jervis, since the world is anarchic, a state might, for defensive purposes, build its military capability. However, since states are not aware of each other's intentions, other states might interpret a defensive buildup as offensive; if so and if offensive action against the state that is only building its defenses is advantageous, the other states might prefer to take an aggressive stance, which will \\"make the situation unstable\\". In such situation, an arms race may become a strong possibility.Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) Robert Jervis gives the example of Germany and Britain before World War I. \\"Much of the behaviour in this period was the product of technology and beliefs that magnified the security dilemma\\". In that example, strategists believed that offense would be more advantageous than defense, but that ultimately turned out to not be the case.Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) Competition on nuclear weapons construction between the United States and the Soviet Union, during the Cold War, is a well-known example of an arms race.Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) =Alliance formation= The security dilemma might force states to form new alliances or to strengthen existing alliances. \\"If offense has less advantage, stability and cooperation are likely\\".Jervis, R. \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\", World Politics vol. 30, no. 2 (1978): 186‚Äì214 (Published by Cambridge University Press) According to Glenn H. Snyder, under a security dilemma there are two reasons that alliances will form. First, a state that is dissatisfied with the amount of security it has forms alliances in order to bolster its security. Second, a state is in doubt about the reliability of existing allies in coming to its aid, and thus decides to court another ally or allies. According to Thomas Christensen and Jack Snyder, in a multipolar world two types of alliance dilemma exist which are contrary in nature. These alliance dilemmas are known as chain ganging and buck passing.Christensen, T.J. and Snyder, J. \\"Chain Gangs and Passed Bucks: Predicting Alliance Patterns in Multipolarity\\", International Organization (Spring 1990) vol. 4, no. 2 (Published by the World Peace Foundation and MIT) Chain ganging In a multipolar world, alliance security is interconnected. When one ally decides to participate in war, it pulls its alliance partners into the war too, which is referred to as chain ganging. If the partner does not participate in the war fully, it will endanger the security of its ally. For example, in World War I, to the alliance between Austria-Hungary and Germany, according to Waltz, did this: \\"If Austria-Hungary marched, Germany had to follow: the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire would have left Germany alone in the middle of Europe\\". On the other side, if \\"France marched, Russia had to follow; a German victory over France would be a defeat for Russia. And so it was all around the vicious circle, because the defeat or defection of a major alliance would have shaken the balance, each alliance partner would have shaken the balance, each state was constrained to adjust its strategy\\".Waltz, K. Theory of International Politics, 1979, McGraw-Hill, p. 167 Buck passing In the face of a rising threat, balancing alignments fail to form in a timely fashion as states try to freeride on other states. States might do so to avoid the expense of war for themselves. For example, to use Waltz's example, in World War II, the French Foreign Minister told the British Prime Minister that Britain was justified in taking \\"the lead in opposing Germany\\" when the Nazis had taken over the Rhineland, but as \\"the German threat grew\\", France and Britain hoped that Germany and the Soviet Union \\"would balance each other off or fight to the finish. Uncertainties about... who will gain or lose from the action of other states accelerate as number of states increases\\".Waltz, K. Theory of International Politics, 1979, McGraw-Hill, p. 165 Criticisms and responses According to Alexander Wendt, \\"Security dilemmas are not given by anarchy or nature\\" but, rather, are \\"a social structure composed of intersubjective understandings in which states are so distrustful that they make worst-case assumptions about each other's intentions\\".Wendt, A. \\"Anarchy is What States Make of It: The Social Construction of Power Politics\\", International Organization vol. 46, no. 2: 397 Glaser argues that Wendt mischaracterised the security dilemma. \\"Wendt is using the security dilemma to describe the result of states' interaction whereas Jervis and the literature he has spawned use the security dilemma to refer to a situation created by the material conditions facing states, such as geography and prevailing technology\\". According to Wendt because the security dilemma is the result of one state's interaction with another, a state can adopt policies which hinder the security dilemma. Glaser blames Wendt for \\"exaggerating the extent to which structural realism calls for competitive policies and, therefore, the extent to which it leads to security dilemmas\\". Glaser argues that though offensive realists presume that in an international system a state has to compete for power, the security dilemma is a concept mainly used by defensive realists and according to defensive realists it is beneficial for nations to cooperate under certain circumstances. Another mode of criticism of the security dilemma concept is to question the validity of the offence-defense balance. Since weapons of offense and of defense are the same, how can the distinction between the two be connected with a state's intentions? As a result, critics have questioned whether the offense-defense balance can be used as a variable in explaining international conflicts.Lynn- Jones, S.M. \\"Offense-Defense Theory and Its Critics\\", Security Studies vol. 4, no. 4 (Summer 1995): 660‚Äì691 (Published by Frank Cass, London) According to Glaser, criticisms of the offense-defense balance are based on two misunderstandings. First, the sameness or difference of offensive weapons compared with defensive weapons does not impact the offense-defense balance itself. Offense-defense theory assumes that both parties in conflict will use those weapons that suit their strategy and goals. Second, whether both states involved in the conflict have some common weapons between them is the wrong question to ask in seeking to understand the offense-defense balance. Instead, critics should focus on the influence or net effect of weapons used in the conflict. According to Glaser, \\"Distinguishability should be defined by comparative net assessment\\" or the comparison of the balance of offense- defense when both sides use weapons versus when neither side is using weapons.Glaser, C.L. \\"The Security Dilemma Revisited\\", World Politics vol. 50, no. 1 (October 1997): 171‚Äì201 See also * Balance of power in international relations * Escalation of commitment * Hobbesian trap * Prisoner's dilemma References Category:International security Category:International relations theory Category:Political realism Category:Security studies Category:Dilemmas Category:National security Category:Defense ","title":"Security dilemma"},{"id":"1144321","text":"The Adelaide Southern Veloway The Southern Expressway (route M2) is an freewayA guide to using the Southern Expressway, Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure, Government of South Australia in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia, between Bedford ParkSuburb boundaries, Warriparinga Ward , City of Marion and Old Noarlunga. It is the southern part of the North‚ÄìSouth Corridor which extends the full length of Adelaide and is being built to urban freeway standard. The Southern Expressway was built as a corridor to relieve heavy traffic from the major arterial, Main South Road, in Adelaide's south. It was originally built as a reversible one way freeway, and was the world's longest after its completion in 2001. Between 2010 and 2014 it was expanded and it is now a regular 2-direction freeway. Construction of the expressway also included the Adelaide Southern Veloway for cyclists, which runs alongside it for 7 km, from Marion/Main South Road to the Reynella Interchange. South of the Reynella Interchange, the bikeway becomes a shared track for the remaining 12 km of the expressway. The expressway crosses over the Coast to Vines Rail Trail at both Panalatinga Road and at the expressway's southern end. History =Pre-construction= The expressway is the southern part of a north‚Äìsouth freeway originally conceptualised under the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS), completed in 1965, as a freeway bypassing the city from Dry Creek to Old Noarlunga.MATS plan freeways, ozroads.com.au The MATS plan proved unpopular, and in 1971 all further highway construction in Adelaide was postponed for a period of ten years. In 1983 plans for the freeway north of Darlington were abandoned, and the land that had been set aside was progressively sold off. In 1984 the state government announced plans to develop a \\"third arterial road\\" for the south. In 1987 the project was split into two phases, the first the upgrading of Main South Road and Marion Road in the Darlington area, and the second a new road from Darlington to Reynella. Phase one was completed in 1994 with the widening of Main South Road to eight lanes between Ayliffes Road and Seacombe Road, and the widening of Marion Road to six lanes between Main South Road and Sturt Road. Phase 2 became the expressway, which was to be constructed in two stages: from Darlington to Reynella, and from Reynella to Old Noarlunga. It was developed as a one-way reversible road with future duplication provided for in the roadworks base, to be constructed when the need arose. It used the remaining \\"Noarlunga Freeway\\" reservation, except for the northernmost kilometre where a new route through O'Halloran Hill was chosen to provide high-quality links with Marion and Main South Roads without interfering with existing infrastructure at Sturt. =Construction of the reversible freeway= Construction of the expressway commenced in July 1995 and the first stage was opened to traffic on 17 December 1997. Construction commenced on the second stage in February 1999 and was opened to traffic on 9 September 2001. The total cost of the reversible freeway was A$76.5m.  Promotional FM radio transmitter  During its construction and for some time after its opening, the expressway was promoted via a dedicated FM radio station established by the Department of Transport broadcasting via a low-power FM transmitter in the immediate vicinity of the road. The radio station broadcast a recorded message on continuous loop featuring promotional and community information messages relating to the expressway, including a jingle that Transport Minister Diana Laidlaw declared made the expressway the only road in the world to have its own jingle. =Operation as a one way road= Until August 2014, the expressway was open approximately 21 hours per day, one way for over 10 hours in each direction. The northbound (city-bound) direction occurred on weekday mornings (2:00 am ‚Äì 12:30 pm) and weekend evenings (2:00 pm ‚Äì 12:30 am), the southbound direction on weekday evenings (2:00 pm ‚Äì 12:30 am) and weekend mornings (2:00 am ‚Äì 12:30 pm). It was closed 12:30‚Äì2:00 am and 12:30‚Äì2:00 pm, except for Saturday and Monday mornings when the direction remained unchanged. Weekday public holidays also operated under the weekend's opening times to accommodate tourists travelling to the Fleurieu Peninsula. During each closure all road signs, lights and boom gates changed over, and the road was inspected by a tow truck contractor for debris and car breakdowns. =Duplication= In 2007 the Howard Government pledged $100m towards widening the expressway in its unsuccessful re-election bid.PM's $100m pledge, Mark Kenny, The Advertiser, 18 August 2007. On 17 February 2010, during the state election campaign, Premier Mike Rann announced that, if re-elected the expressway would be duplicated in a A$445m project.http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/in- depth/southern-expressway-to-be-doubled-announces-sa-premier-mike-rann/story- fn2sdwup-1225831294904 However, the inclusion of a new A$75m interchange at Darlington was later scrapped, after the government planning for a major transport hub at Darlington discovered the need for a $50 million section of road that would have to be destroyed when the expressway was eventually duplicated. Once duplication was announced in 2010, construction started one year later in 2011. The first construction-related expressway closures were 3 consecutive days in January 2012, out of peak hours, but is the most disruption the road has experienced since the opening of Stage 2, with only day-long resurfacing of line-marking, and cycle rides disrupting the expressway previously. Due to the duplication of the Expressway, all of the bridges had to be widened to meet the new width of the road. Some road bridges were closed during the work needed, and others required a temporary lower speed limit for safety reasons. This caused some anger to residents and businesses.Southern Expressway upgrade affects trade for Morphett Vale businesses, The Australian, 21 May 2013 The new road was built entirely on the western side of the original roadway, and is four lanes wide between Reynella and Marion Road in the northbound. Accessibility has been improved with the project, with completely new intersections at Beach Road and Sheriffs Road, as well as being able to left turn out at Old Noarlunga, right turn out at Marion Road, and left turn in at Marion Road. The expressway opened to two-way traffic in August 2014 and a cost of about A$400m.http://dpti.sa.gov.au/southern_expressway_duplication = Darlington Upgrade = Ayliffes Road bridge: The above ground road bridges were assembled on-site and moved into their final position using multi-wheeled lifters. In 2014 the abandoned plans for an interchange at Darlington were revived and expanded to extend the Southern Expressway through Darlington. The original project scope was to extend the expressway with a lowered motorway corridor passing underneath Flinders Drive (access to Flinders University and Flinders Medical Centre), Sturt Road and a bridge connecting local streets Mimosa Terrace and Sutton Road, to the intersection of South Road, Ayliffes Road and Shepherds Hill Road with surface-level service roads and segreggated cycling and pedestrian paths; however, the project was later revised to continue the extension past Tonsley giving a total length of 3.3 kilometres. A road bridge, accessible from the Main South Road surface road and the lowered motorway, also allows northbound traffic free-flow access to Ayliffes Road. The associated Flinders Link Project is extending the Tonsley railway line over this corridor to Flinders Medical Centre. Early works commenced late in 2014 and Gateway South, a joint venture of Fulton Hogan and Laing O'Rourke was awarded the major works contract for the project in January 2016. Major works commenced in 2016 for an expected project completion in 2018, later revised to December 2019. Completion was further delayed to 2020 due to sections of the lowered motorway wall having collapsed. Construction was completed and the lowered motorway fully opened to traffic on 1 August, with the final road surfacing scheduled for late 2020.

Founded in 1859, it is one of the oldest zoos in Europe and is a member of EAZA. It comprises and is located in the municipality of Frederiksberg, sandwiched between the parks of Frederiksberg Gardens and S√∏ndermarken. With 1,161,388 visitors in 2008 it is the most visited zoo and 4th most visited attraction in Denmark. The zoo is noted for its new Elephant House designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster. The zoo maintains and promotes a number of European breeding programmes. History Copenhagen Zoo, 1873 Copenhagen Zoo was founded by the ornithologist Niels Kj√¶rb√∏lling in 1859. He was given the summer garden of \\"Prinsess Vilhelmines Have\\" (The garden of Princess Vilhelmine) by the chief directorate of Copenhagen. The animals that the visitors could contemplate at the opening were eagles, chickens, ducks, owls, rabbits, a fox, a seal in a bathtub and a turtle in a bucket. In the early years the zoo focused on showing as many different types of animals as possible, but as animal welfare later became an issue, the number of different species has dropped in favour of more space to each animal. In 1901 the zoo had a human display with 25 Indians- men, women and children- in an exhibition where the \\"brown exotic\\" people went about their daily lives in palm tree leaf huts constructed in the middle of the zoo. One of the most notable animals kept there was a male slow worm that lived there from 1892 to 1946 (for 54 years, which is a record among lizards). Starting in the early 1980s, Copenhagen Zoo has been undergoing a renovations aimed at replacing cages with enclosures which recreate animals' natural environments, giving a better lifestyle to the animals, and a more realistic experience to visitors. The Elephant House and Savanna are results of these efforts. The Savanna includes a Hippopotamus House where the hippos can be watched underwater. The zoo has preserved many of its historical buildings. The oldest building still in use, a stable for yaks, was erected in 1872, and now houses the bactrian camels. A Herbivore House built in 1875 still houses herbivores, namely tapirs. An owl tower from 1885 is today left as a memorial commemorating how zoo animals were once kept. The observation tower A notable and highly visible feature of the zoo is the wooden observation tower. high, it offers views of the surrounding parklands and city. The tower was built in 1905 and is one of the tallest observation towers built of wood in the world. Its base is similar to that of Eiffel Tower. Exhibits Animals exhibited at the zoo that are not housed in any of the main areas include bactrian camels, American flamingos, scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, Dalmatian pelicans, turkey vultures, Humboldt penguins, California sea lions, black-capped squirrel monkeys, chimpanzees and lions. =The Nordics and the Arctic Ring= In the part of the zoo called \\"The Nordics\\" (), visitors can see species such as harbour seals, snowy owls, reindeer, musk oxen, brown bears, arctic foxes and grey wolves. The \\"Arctic Ring\\" (), which opened in 2013, has an exhibit for polar bears (including a tunnel allowing underwater views) and an aviary for North Atlantic seabirds (alcids).A.P.Moller Fonden (February 2013). Den Arktiske Ring . Retrieved 19 January 2014 =Asia= In the \\"Asia\\" () section, visitors can see Oriental small-clawed otters, red pandas, Malayan tapirs, Amur leopards and tigers, Asian elephants, and other animals. The new Elephant House, which opened in June 2008, is designed by Norman Foster in cooperation with the Danish landscape architect Stig L. Andersson. It houses Asian elephants, and contains two glass-domed enclosures. One is for cows and calves and measures . The other is and is for bulls, kept in separate pens during the mating season for fear of fights. The building also contain an exhibit space and a small lecture hall. The enclosures open out through mighty rusted steel doors into am almost 1 hectare big landscaped paddock with a pool deep and long. The paddock's border with Frederiksberg Gardens, once a high wall, has been opened up so that people in the park can now watch the elephants. This has been done because the zoo, with its central location is very much a city zoo, wants to integrate with the urban landscape. At the same time it affords the elephants distant views of open parkland and ancient trees, which prevents them feeling too enclosured. =Africa= Most of the \\"Africa\\" () section is taken up by the \\"Savanna\\" () area. This is an open field with a visitor bridge above containing species such as white rhinoceroses, giraffes, impalas, sable antelopes, ostriches and plains zebras. The hippopotamuses, which have their own separate enclosure, also has partial access to the Savanna. Other species in the Africa section are okapis, Abyssinian ground hornbills, Congo peafowl, caracals and meerkats. =Tasmania= The \\"Tasmania\\" () section is unique to Copenhagen Zoo. The section was started after the wedding of Frederik, the Crown Prince of Denmark and the Tasmanian native Mary Donaldson in 2004, where the Tasmanian government gifted four Tasmanian Devils to the zoo. These were the first Tasmanian devils to live outside of Australia. The area has since been expanded with a combined area for red-necked wallabies, Eastern Grey Kangaroos and common wombats. Parts of this area is also accessible by visitors, allowing kangaroos and people to cross paths. =South America= In the \\"South America\\" () section, visitors can see species such as capybaras, guanacos, greater rheas, Patagonian maras, southern screamers and giant anteaters. They all have access to one common area, modeled after the South American pampas. =Tropical Zoo= The \\"Tropical Zoo\\" () consists of a rainforest hall with one section for free-ranging birds, turtles and two-toed sloths and another for tropical butterflies and West African crocodiles. In between the two is a section for reptiles, amphibians, fish and the rare Java mouse-deer. =Children's Zoo= In the Children's Zoo (), visitors can see farm animals and small domestic animals, such as llamas, goats, cows, pigs, horses, chickens and rabbits. Rare species * For several years, Copenhagen Zoo was the only zoo outside Australia that had Tasmanian devils,. They bred for the first time in Copenhagen Zoo in 2013 and the two females gave birth to a total of seven young.Glaetzer, S. (5 January 2014). Denmark's Copenhagen Zoo plans to lead way in Tasmanian devil care. The Mercury. Retrieved 7 January 2014. * Other rare species and subspecies kept in the zoo include: Schmitz's Caracals, Cape Weavers, Black-necked Weavers, East African Chimpanzee, Yellow- headed Amazon, Pink-tongued Skink, Tasmanian Wombat, Tasmanian Eastern Grey Kangaroo, Banded Razorbill and West African crocodile; all of which are rarely kept species in European zoos. * Copenhagen Zoo has the rare Amur leopard, okapi, and muskox. * In April 2019 Copenhagen Zoo received two giant panda on loan from China.  Culling controversy  A healthy young male giraffe, Marius, was killed on 9 February 2014 on the recommendation of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria. His meat was fed to the zoo's lions, while other parts were transferred to a scientific institution. The scientific director at Copenhagen Zoo, Bengt Holst defended the culling, saying that the giraffes at the zoo bred very well, and where this was the case, giraffes had to be killed to ensure the best genes were passed down to ensure the animals' long-term survival. He confirmed the zoo typically culls 20 to 30 animals every year. The death occurred despite offers from other animal institutions (EAZA member Yorkshire Wildlife Park (YWP) in the United Kingdom and Hoenderdael Park in The Netherlands) to take the giraffe. YWP released a statement that it had the capacity to accept a further giraffe into its bachelor herd in its state-of-the-art giraffe house built in 2012, and that contact had been made with Copenhagen Zoo but no reply had been received. YWP has previously received a male giraffe of the same age as Marius from Copenhagen Zoo. Bengt Holst stated that the capacity at YWP would be better utilised by a giraffe whose genes were less represented amongst EAZA zoos. The action was criticized by Stine Jensen from Denmark's Organisation Against the Suffering of Animals, who repudiated the action as unethical. She said, \\"This situation should not have occurred at all. It just shows that the zoo is in fact not the ethical institution that it wants to portray itself as being, because here you have a waste product - that being Marius. Here we have a zoo which thinks that putting this giraffe down instead of thinking of alternatives is the best option\\". Images of the carcass being cut up in front of children and then fed to the zoo's lion population were circulated by the Associated Press. The zoo spokesperson, Tobias Stenbaek Bro, has been quoted as saying that visitors, including children, were invited to watch as the giraffe was skinned and parts fed to the lions. \\"I'm actually proud because I think we have given children a huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe that they wouldn't have had from watching a giraffe in a photo,\\" Stenbaek Bro said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press. On 25 March 2014, despite the backlash from the giraffe cull, the zoo euthanized four lions (two adults and two ten-month-old cubs). The zoo stated that they were introducing a male lion and did not want to disrupt the pride's natural structure and behaviour. The lions were not culled or dissected in public.https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/giraffe-uproar- copenhagen-zoo-kills-lions-23052636https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation- now/2014/03/25/lions-copenhagen-zoo-marius- giraffe/6873763/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/10722496/Danish- zoo-that-killed-giraffe-puts-down-four-lions.html Cultural references Copenhagen Zoo is used as location in the films K√∏benhavnere (1933), Wienerbarnet (1941), Hold fingrene fra mor (1951), Far til fire p√• landet (1955)m Vi er allesammen tossede (1959), Rikki og m√¶ndene (1962), Den store badedag (1991) and Far til fire p√• japansk (2010).

They were the dominant freight locomotive on the system until World War II, and they remained in service until the end of PRR steam in 1957. Nicknames for the type included Decs and Hippos, the latter due to the large boiler. Unlike smaller 2-10-0s that preceded them, the I1s design was huge, taking advantage of the PRR's heavy trackage and high allowed axle load, with a wide, free-steaming boiler. Large cylinders enabled the I1s to apply that power to the rails. However, the large boiler limited the size of the driving wheels, which made it impossible to mount counterweights large enough to balance the piston thrusts. As a result, they were hard riding at anything but low speeds and prone to slipping, and not popular with crews.http://www.rgusrail.com/nyprr4483.html Their power was undeniable, with one author describing them as \\"the holy terror of the PRR\\". Subclass I1sa increased maximum steam cut-off to admit steam for 78% of the piston stroke (rather than the original 50%), boosting low speed tractive effort from . There was no obvious external difference except for a revised builders' plate (and of course the revised combination lever). I1s locomotives were converted to I1sa during major overhauls; eventually 489 were converted while 109 remained as built. In 1923 PRR put engine 4358 on the Altoona test plant. The tests below were all stoker fired. * In two hours at it consumed of coal () and averaged of tractive effort at the driver rims, corresponding to 6.4% thermal efficiency. * In one hour at it consumed of coal () and averaged tractive effort, or 7.1% efficiency. * At (40% cutoff, so not a maximum effort) it consumed of coal and averaged TE, for 7.1% efficiency. * At at 50% cutoff it consumed of coal in 30 minutes averaging TE, for an efficiency of just under 5.4%.  Preservation  Of the nearly 600 class I1 locomotives built for the Pennsy, a sole example, #4483, survived the scrapper's torch. The locomotive was retired in August of 1957. Following then Chief of Motive Power Hal T. Cover's instructions, the railroad moved the engine to its roundhouse in Northumberland, PA, along with several other retired steam locomotives labeled for preservation. There the engine sat until 1963, when the PRR sold it to the Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO) and moved the engine to Wilmerding, PA. WABCO had originally sought a railroad-themed display for its headquarters to commemorate its heritage of supplying air brakes to America's railroads. #4483 saw little maintenance during its life as a display piece for the company and its condition deteriorated significantly, although the boiler's asbestos cladding was removed. By 1982, the company had grown tired of the locomotive on its front lawn. The Western New York Railway Historical Society acquired #4483 and moved the engine to Hamburg, NY, where it resides today, receiving occasional maintenance. Currently, the organization hopes to move the locomotive to the Heritage Discovery Center in Buffalo, NY, where the engine will sit on public display protected from the elements.

In 1884 he married Belle Goshorn.\\"West Virginia's First Ladies,\\" West Virginia Division of Culture and History, June 2007. In 1892, as the Democratic Party's candidate, he was elected governor of West Virginia. As governor, MacCorkle advocated increased funding for state institutions and improved transportation. Through an advertising program, he actively promoted the state's natural resources to attract industry. MacCorkle opposed the growing labor movement among coal miners and dispatched the state militia to break a strike. After leaving office, MacCorkle returned to his Charleston law practice. In his numerous travels, he continued to publicize the state's resources. In 1910, he was elected to the West Virginia Senate. MacCorkle was also a founder and president of the Citizens National Bank, which later merged with the Charleston National Bank. He wrote an autobiography, The Recollections of Fifty Years, which was published in 1928. He died at his Charleston home, Sunrise, in 1930. Legacy Maccorkle's mansion, Sunrise, became home to a children's museum in the early 1960s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In Charleston, a major arterial road, Maccorkle Avenue, was named for him and carries U.S. Route 60 through the area. His papers form a valuable research resource at the MacCorkle Collection of the West Virginia State History and Archives website. The children's museum (now called Avampato Discovery Museum) was relocated to The Clay Center about two miles away in downtown Charleston in 2003. The Sunrise estate currently houses the law firm of Farmer Cline & Campbell PLLC. WM. A MacCorkle on May 9, 1900 in Montgomery, Alabama did address the Southern Conference On Race Problems. The address was entitled The Negro and The Intelligence and Property Franchise. This addressed passionately set forth his opinions advocating for rights for the African Americans.

The community is nestled between West Los Angeles and Cheviot Hills. This enclave draws young professionals and families and is home to residents working in a variety of professional occupations. History proves the neighborhood was once a part of Westwood until Olympic Blvd. was placed dividing the area North and South. The Southern section, now known as Rancho Park, felt cut off from its North side lobbying for its own identity in the 1930s. Geography It is bordered by Sawtelle on the west, West Los Angeles on the northwest, Cheviot Hills on the east, and Westside Village on the south. The district's boundaries, while somewhat ill-defined, are generally considered to be the San Diego Freeway (I-405) or Sepulveda on the west, Olympic Boulevard on the north, Manning Avenue (south of Pico Boulevard) and Beverly Glen Boulevard (north of Pico) on the east, and National Boulevard on the south. (Los Angeles City signs mark Olympic Boulevard as the district's northern boundary.) Major thoroughfares include Pico, Westwood, Olympic, Sepulveda, and Beverly Glen Boulevards, along with Overland and Manning Avenues. Nearby is Santa Monica Boulevard. Century City is also located nearby. The name  Rancho Park was named by area boosters after World War II. > We thought it was about time to have our own community.

The neighborhood Rancho Park was developed in the 1920s as a middle-class area, and most of its housing stock consists of Spanish Colonial bungalows and ranch houses. Today, many of the modest sized homes have been rehabbed into larger and more modern architecture. Apart from the heavily traveled stretch of Pico Boulevard (including the Westside Pavilion shopping mall) in its central portions, the district has a notably quiet, suburban feel. The district's streets are equipped with faux 19th-century streetlights and feature large deciduous trees in the strips between the sidewalk and the street. (Rancho Park is one of the few districts in Los Angeles where fall foliage can be seen.) The enclave is centrally located to other Westside communities.

Plants of the genus owe their common name \\"devil's claw\\" to the peculiar appearance of their hooked fruit. Several species of North American plants in the genus Proboscidea and certain species of Pisonia, however, are also known by this name. Devil's claw's tuberous roots are used in folk medicine to reduce pain. Range Harpagophytum procumbens is mainly found in the eastern and south eastern parts of Namibia, Southern Botswana, and the Kalahari region of the Northern Cape, South Africa. H. zeyheri is found in the northern parts of Namibia (Ovamboland) and southern Angola.  Folk medicine and research The ethnobotanical use of devil's claw originated in southern Africa. H. procumbens is one of the floral emblems of Botswana where it is thought to be useful in treating a variety of pain conditions. Preparations of the plant or its extracts, such as harpagoside, are presumed to have uses in folk medicine and phytotherapy as an anti-inflammatory herbal drug or dietary supplement. Although there is no accepted clinical evidence of its efficacy and bioavailability, limited effects were noted for treating lower back pain and osteoarthritis. A Cochrane review of clinical research noted that devil's claw seems to reduce low back pain more than placebo, although evidence was of moderate quality at best.  Adverse reactions  Side effects and drug interactions with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may occur, and caution exists for a variety of conditions, such as pregnancy and cardiovascular disorders. Devil's claw may cause diarrhea and may interfere with the action of ticlopidine and warfarin.  Ecology and management  Harpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150‚Äì300 mm/year). It is a perennial, tuberous plant with annually produced creeping stems. The above-ground stems emerge after the first rains and die back during droughts or after frosts. The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. Seeds have a high degree of dormancy. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years. The sustainability of the trade in devil‚Äôs claw has been questioned for several years. The governments of the each of the countries in which it occurs (range states; Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa) have developed policies and regulations to protect the species, to determine a sustainable harvest, and to provide for continued livelihoods for the harvesters. At various times, the species has been proposed for protection by the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However, the range states have implemented measures to manage the trade sustainably and the proposal to protect the species by CITES was withdrawn. Various studies have examined the biological and ecological requirements of harvested and unharvested populations. Several early short-term studies in Botswana examined the ecological requirements of the species. Other, somewhat more recent studies inventoried the resource and examined sustainable harvesting methods. The ecological requirements of a harvested species must be known to manage the harvest of the species to ensure it is sustainable. Stewart and Cole (2005) examined the complex economic, social, and cultural factors involved in the harvest of the species. Stewart (2009) examined population structure, density, growth, mortality, and seed and fruit production in harvested and unharvested populations in the Kalahari savannas of South Africa. Plant density and population structure differed significantly between overgrazed and grass- dominated areas, suggesting that the differences may be due to competition for scarce water and nutrients. Experimental removal of secondary tubers (harvest) was not a significant factor for mortality in any of the harvested size classes. Harvest also did not affect growth, although plants in the medium size class grew more during the study period in both the harvested and unharvested populations. Fruit production was highly variable, and mature fruits were produced only under favorable conditions. Under the conditions of this experimental harvest, the species appears to be resilient to harvest, with plants subjected to harvest surviving as well as unharvested plants. However, due to the spatially variable nature of its habitat and the plasticity of the plants themselves, harvesting data from actual harvested areas from a large number of plants is required to better understand the life history of the species.

In 1938 she earned an agr√©gation of history, and in 1939 she married Raymond Samuel, who became known as Raymond Aubrac. In 1940 she joined the French Resistance. In Clermont-Ferrand, Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie formed the Resistant group La Derni√®re Colonne, later known as Lib√©ration-sud, with her, her husband, and Jean Cavaill√®s. During 1941, the group carried out two sabotage attacks at train stations in Perpignan and Cannes. In February, they organised the distribution of 10,000 propaganda flyers, but one of the distributors was caught by the police, leading to the arrest of d'Astier's niece and uncle. The group decided to cease activities. After a few months' hiatus, they began to work on an underground newspaper, Lib√©ration. The first edition was put together with the help of the typographers from a local newspaper and printed on paper supplied by local trade-unionists. 10,000 copies were produced in July 1941. In March 1943 her husband was arrested, but he was released in May of that year, after she intervened with the local Vichy public prosecutor. However, in June of that year he was arrested again. Lucie then claimed to be his fianc√©e, saying he was named \\"Ermelin\\" (one of his aliases) and that he had been caught in the raid while innocently visiting a doctor. She was told that he was to be executed for resistance, and asked to marry him; a French legal clause allowed engaged people to marry if one of them was soon to die. Later, when he was being brought back to prison after the supposed marriage, he and fifteen other prisoners were rescued by resisters in cars, led by Lucie, who attacked the vehicle he was in. Ho Chi Minh, baby Elizabeth Aubrac and Lucie Aubrac, 1946 In 1944 Charles de Gaulle appointed a consultative assembly, which Lucie joined as a resistance representative; this made her the first woman to sit in a French parliamentary assembly. In 1945 she published the first short history of the French Resistance. In 1946 she and Raymond hosted Ho Chi Minh at their home in France, and he became friends with Raymond. He had gone to France in an unsuccessful mission to win independence for the then-French colony of Vietnam. In 1984 she published a semi-fictional version of her wartime diaries, the English translation of which is known as Outwitting the Gestapo. She was inspired to publish her own writing on the wartime after Klaus Barbie's claim that her husband Raymond had become an informer and betrayed Jean Moulin after his own arrest. The 1992 film Boulevard des hirondelles was about her and Raymond's life during the French Resistance. In 1996 Lucie was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government for her heroism during World War II. The 1997 film Lucie Aubrac is about her efforts to rescue her husband; in it she is played by Carole Bouquet. She herself endorsed the film. In April 1997, Jacques Verg√®s produced a \\"Barbie testament\\" which he claimed that Klaus Barbie had given him ten years earlier which purported to show the Aubracs had tipped off Barbie regarding Moulin.Clinton, Alan Jean Moulin, 1899‚Äì1943 The French Resistance and the Republic, London: Macmillan 2002 page 209. Verg√®s's \\"Barbie testament\\" was timed for the publication of the book Aubrac Lyon 1943 by G√©rard Chauvy, which was meant to prove that the Aubracs were the ones who informed Barbie about the fateful meeting at Caluire where Moulin was arrested in 1943.Clinton, Alan Jean Moulin, 1899‚Äì1943 The French Resistance and the Republic, London: Macmillan 2002 On 2 April 1998 following a civil suit launched by the Aubracs, a Paris court fined Chauvy and his publisher Albin Michel for \\"public defamation\\".Clinton, Alan Jean Moulin, 1899‚Äì1943 The French Resistance and the Republic, London: Macmillan 2002 pages 209‚Äì210. In 1998, the French historian Jacques Baynac in his book Les Secrets de l'affaire Jean Moulin claimed that Moulin was planning to break with de Gaulle to recognize General Giraud, which led the Gaullists to tip off Barbie before this could happen.Clinton, Alan Jean Moulin, 1899‚Äì1943 The French Resistance and the Republic, London: Macmillan 2002 page 210. Twenty leading resistance survivors published a letter protesting the accusations against the Aubracs, and the Aubracs themselves asked to appear before a panel of leading French historians. The Aubracs did appear in a discussion between themselves and historians, organized by the newspaper Lib√©ration. While none of the historians involved believed that Raymond was an informer, they did note inconsistencies in Lucie's account of his case. Patrick Marnham's biography of Moulin, The Death of Jean Moulin: Biography of a Ghost (2001) suggests Raymond and possibly Lucie betrayed Moulin.Marnham, Patrick. The Death of Jean Moulin: Biography of a Ghost. Pimlico. . As well, in his book Resistance and Betrayal: The Death and Life of the Greatest Hero of the French Resistance (2002), Patrick Marnham suggested that since Raymond Aubrac's overriding allegiance was to communism, he would not have considered himself a traitor if he had indeed betrayed Moulin, claiming that French Communists such as the Aubracs at times gave non-Communists such as Moulin to the Gestapo. Lucie had three children with Raymond. Charles de Gaulle was godfather to their first child, Catherine, and Ho Chi Minh was godfather to their second child, Elizabeth. President Nicolas Sarkozy, in a statement after Raymond's death in 2012, said that Raymond's escape from the Nazis led by Lucie in 1943 had \\"become a legend in the history of the Resistance\\" and praised him and all Resistance members as \\"heroes of the shadows who saved France's honor, at a time when it seemed lost.\\" Serge Klarsfeld, the president of the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France, said to BFM-TV, \\"They (Raymond and Lucie Aubrac) were a legendary couple,\\" adding, \\"They were exceptional people.\\"https://calgaryherald.com/news/Raymond+Aubrac+Former+leader+French+Resistance/6461742/story.html#ixzz1sA2Ukl5A Fran√ßois Hollande said in a statement, \\"In our darkest times, he [Raymond] was, with Lucie Aubrac, among the righteous, who found, in themselves and in the universal values of our Republic, the strength to resist Nazi barbarism.\\" Lucie's ashes are beside Raymond's in the family tomb of the cemetery in the Burgundian village of Salornay-sur-Guye.

Panno was the first top world chess player born in South America. Panno won the 2nd World Junior Chess Championship in 1953, ahead of such future strong Grandmasters as Borislav Ivkov, Bent Larsen, and Fridrik Olafsson. He also won the championship of Argentina the same year. Oscar Panno became a grandmaster at the age of twenty. He had an Elo rating of around 2580 in his prime, and of 2515 in 1986 and 2429 in 2008. Chessmetrics.com, which attempts to rank players from before the introduction of FIDE ratings, estimates that he was as high as 18th in the world in late 1955. He competed in five interzonal tournaments, with his greatest success coming at Gothenburg 1955. In a field of 21 players, Panno finished clear third, only half a point out of second and ahead of such players as Efim Geller, Tigran Petrosian, and Boris Spassky. (He beat future World Champion Spassky in their individual game.) This result was probably the peak of his career, as it advanced him to the 1956 Candidates tournament in Amsterdam, the winner of which would play a 24-game match for the World Championship with Mikhail Botvinnik. However, his form from the interzonal did not carry over and he finished in a tie for 8th-9th in a ten-man field. Panno has several successes at the tournaments at Mar del Plata. He won the international tournaments in 1954 and 1969 (shared with Miguel Najdorf), and the open tournaments in 1986, 1988, and 1994. He twice in a row won the strong Palma de Mallorca international invitational tournament: 1971 together with Ljubomir Ljubojeviƒá, 1972 at the best tie-break along with Viktor Korchnoi and Jan Smejkal. Panno tied for first at the prestigious Lone Pine 1977. He played various famous grandmasters. In addition to his win over Boris Spassky in 1955, he also beat him at the 1976 Manila interzonal.

Yongsan has a population of 313,814 (2010) and has a geographic area of , and is divided into 19 dong (administrative neighborhoods). Yongsan is located in central Seoul on the northern bank of the Han River, bordering the city districts of Jung to the north, Mapo to the west, Yeongdeungpo and Dongjak to the southwest, Seocho and Gangnam District to the southeast, and Seongdong to the east. Yongsan is part of the Seongjeosimni (Outer old Seoul) area immediately south of Seoul's historic center in Jung on the southern side of Namsan. Yongsan is home to notable locations such as the National Museum of Korea, the War Memorial of Korea, Itaewon district, the Yongsan Electronics Market, and Haebangchon, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Seoul. Seong Jang- Hyeon (ÏÑ±Ïû•ÌòÑ) of the Democratic Party has been the mayor of Yongsan since July 2010. Description Itaewon Underpass, the glass building on the left is Yongsan District Office. Yongsan District is a district of Seoul, South Korea. Its name means \\"Dragon Hill\\", derived from the hanja characters for dragon ( yong) and hill/mountain ( san). It sits to the north of the Han River under the shadow of Seoul Tower in the center of Seoul. It is home to roughly 250,000 people and is divided into 20 dong, or neighborhoods. Notable locations in Yongsan District include Yongsan Station, the sprawling Yongsan Electronics Market, Haebangchon and the Itaewon commercial district. Itaewon is widely known as one of the most ethnically diverse regions in Korea. Many foreigners gravitate to its shopping centers and nightlife. It is the site of Yongsan Garrison, a large United States military base in the heart of Seoul. Because of the scarcity of land in central Seoul, and to consolidate U.S. Forces throughout the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. and South Korean governments have agreed to relocate the facility out of Seoul to Pyeongtaek by 2017 with a plan to develop the 243 ha of its land into a large park. Sookmyung Women's University is in the western portion of this district. Nearby, the legendary bar \\"Doors\\" has been a hub of Sookmyung social life for years. There is a growing community of Muslims and others from the Middle East due to the location of Seoul's only mosque, Seoul Central Mosque in Itaewon, which has caused a number of halal restaurants and shops to open in the area. N Seoul Tower has been re-opened. The tower is at the top of Namsan (lit. \\"South Mountain\\") and was built as a television transmitter. Yongsan is served by Seoul Subway Line 1, Line 4, Line 6, and the Jungang Line.

It is a concept album focusing on a character's search for self-discovery. It was described by Allmusic as Pain of Salvation's breakthrough album. Outline While both Remedy Lane and Pain of Salvation's second album, One Hour by the Concrete Lake, feature a protagonist searching for self-discovery, Remedy Lane addresses a wider variety of themes, including love, loss, lust, sex and self-understanding. The album, written by guitarist and vocalist Daniel Gildenl√∂w, is semi-autobiographical in nature. The liner notes include poems and photos related to the concept as well as date markings to signify the chronological order of the album. Gildenl√∂w has said that the inspiration for Remedy Lane was an era of his life in which he wished to understand the nature of freedom. The album's production is similar to its predecessor, The Perfect Element, part I. While its mood is dark, there are some moments of happiness. Track listing All lyrics by Daniel Gildenl√∂w. All music by Daniel Gildenl√∂w, except instrumental part of \\"Rope Ends\\" by Daniel Gildenl√∂w and Fredrik Hermansson.

He has an older brother named Dave, and an older sister named Tami; their parents later divorced. Montoya attended Mead Senior High School, where his friends included \\"drug-users and musicians.\\" When he was seventeen, the local law enforcement raided his home. He was not arrested at that point, but later was for a DUI. After spending some time in jail, Montoya knew \\"[he] didn't want to spend the rest of [his] life behind bars.\\" From that point on, he has rehabbed and has successfully remained clean. Career From an early age, Montoya wanted to play music. Though he was originally interested in the drums, a lack of bass guitarists in the area led him to choose the instrument. He bought his first bass guitar and amp when he was sixteen, with money he earned mowing lawns. After graduating high school, Montoya joined a band named Soul Hammer and planned a move to Portland, Oregon, but was dropped from the band once their demo tape was finished. He then looked for a bass position in The Rocket, a Northwest newspaper, and found an ad from Art Alexakis, the former lead singer of Colorfinger. Alexakis united with him and drummer Scott Cuthbert, and together they founded Everclear. The trio recorded many b-sides and performed live and local shows. In 1993, they released World of Noise, which was recorded in a friend's basement studio. In 1994, Everclear made several changes. Cuthbert was replaced by former Jollymon drummer Greg Eklund. The band also moved from Tim/Kerr Records to Capitol. In 1995, the new Everclear released their U.S. debut album, Sparkle and Fade with singles \\"Heroin Girl,\\" \\"Heartspark Dollarsign,\\" \\"You Make Me Feel Like a Whore,\\" and \\"Santa Monica\\". The album found an audience on the alternative rock scene, as did their 1997 follow-up, So Much for the Afterglow. During a 1998 Australian tour, Montoya got into a heated backstage argument with Alexakis after a fan threw a lit explosive on stage, and the tour was cut short. Montoya did not join the band for the ensuing tour of the United Kingdom, with David LoPrinzi filling in. In August 2003, after three more albums, Montoya left Everclear. In 2004, Montoya formed a new band called Tri-Polar with Sweaty Nipples members Scotty Heard on guitar and Brian Lehfeldt on drums. The band began to record in late 2004, but weeks before its self-titled release on May 27, 2005, Heard left the band for personal reasons. Looking for a replacement, Montoya turned to Kevin Hahn of Red Sector, his bandmate from The Strain. Tri-Polar is still active and plays many cities along the West Coast, including the group members' hometown of Portland. In 2006, Montoya helped formed Castella with Hahn and frontman Ryan Andew of Sidestar. They worked with producer Joe Chiccarelli to record How Did We Get Here during 2007. The record received praise from the critics for its songwriting and production, and several songs from the record found their way onto TV series and movie soundtracks.

Lizardfish (SS-373) was laid down 14 March 1944 by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, WI; launched 16 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Lansdale G. Sasscer; wife of Congressman Sasscer of Maryland; and commissioned 30 December 1944, Cmdr. Ovid M. Butler in command. History =World War II= Lizardfish departed the Manitowoc River 20 January 1945 for Lockport, IL, where she was loaded on a floating drydock and towed down the Mississippi River. She arrived at Algiers, La., 1 February and put to sea 5 days later for the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, arriving 23 March. Lizardfish left Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol 9 April 1945. Topping off with fuel at Saipan on the 21st, she set course for the South China Sea. The submarine maintained a thorough close-in patrol of Indochina between 30 April and 18 May, but contacted no enemy traffic. From 23 to 28 May, a similar painstaking patrol in the Java Sea produced no enemy contacts. Completing this arduous patrol, Lizardfish arrived Fremantle, Australia, on 2 June. Lizardfish got underway 28 June 1945 on her second patrol in the Java and South China Seas. Throughout this patrol, the submarine sought out targets and carried destruction to the enemy in confined harbors, straits, and anchorages. After careful submerged reconnaissance, she made two daring daylight gun attacks within range of shore batteries. On 5 July, she entered the coral-fringed bay of Chelukan Bawang, Bali, discovering four landing barges, a 250-ton sea truck, and a 100-ton submarine chaser, all heavily camouflaged. She made a submerged run and sank Submarine Chaser Alo. 37, then battle-surfaced and opened her deck guns. Her salvos started a gasoline fire which destroyed a nest of four landing barges. She then demolished a boat shed and ripped apart the bow of a sea truck inside. Leaving this target in a flaming mass, she headed out to sea. On 19 July near Sunda Strait, she was patrolling southward along the western shore when her crew sighted a convoy of sea trucks. The submarine surfaced and commenced firing at the closest target, started a brisk fire, and shifted targets. Meanwhile, a shore battery opened up and was lobbing shells close by. When ammunition was expended, Lizardfish submerged, leaving behind three ships burning fiercely. She surfaced that night and headed for lifeguard station off Singapore in support of Army B-24Liberator bomber strikes. The submarine arrived Subic Bay, Philippines, on 6 August and was there when Japan capitulated 9 days later. Lizardfish received one battle star for World War II service. =Postwar= Lizardfish cleared Subic Bay on 31 August and set course for the West Coast, touched Pearl Harbor, and arrived San Francisco on 22 September. At Eureka, CA, 24 October for Navy Day celebrations, Lizardfish five days later tied up at Tiburon, CA, remaining there until 2 January 1946, when she got underway to act as schoolship for the Sonar School at San Diego. She completed her training services on 5 March and reported for inactivation at San Francisco. After operations off the California coast, she was decommissioned, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Mare Island Navy Yard, on 24 June 1946. =Evangelista Torricelli (S 512)= Lizardfish remained in reserve until 16 March 1959, when she departed for Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for Fleet Snorkel conversion and fitting out. She was transferred to the Government of Italy on 9 January 1960 and served the Italian Navy under the name Evangelista Torricelli (S 512). She was stripped of usable parts and the hull scrapped by the Italian Navy in 1976.

The memorandum was not classified as a secret but no scholar noticed it in the archives until 1924. The discussions were between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan (Count) Katsura Tar≈ç on 27 July 1905. The Japanese leader stated Japan's reasons for its making a protectorate of Korea. He repeated that Japan had no interest in the Philippines. The US had acquired the Philippines following its victory over Spain in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. In 1924, Tyler Dennett was the first scholar to see the document; he described it as containing \\"the text of perhaps the most remarkable 'executive agreement' in the history of the foreign relations of the United States\\".\\"President Roosevelt's Secret Pact with Japan,\\" Tyler Dennett, The Current History Magazine, October, 1924, The consensus of historians is that Dennett greatly exaggerated the importance of a routine discussion that changed nothing and set no new policies. Historians pointed out there was no formal agreement on anything new. The word \\"agreement\\" in the documents merely means the two sides agreed that the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes both accurately covered the substance of the conversations.Steven J. Bucklin, \\"THE TAFT-KATSURA AGREEMENT,\\"online President Theodore Roosevelt later agreed that War Secretary Taft had correctly stated the American position. When Dennett first discovered the notes he assumed they indicated a highly significant \\"secret pact\\" between the US and Japan in creating a basis agreement whereby the two formerly isolationist nations became world powers. The conversations regarded the extent of the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States, and maintaining peace between them, in the event of victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War. Korean historians have assumed that, in the discussions, the United States recognized Japan's sphere of influence in Korea; in exchange, Japan recognized the United States' sphere of influence in the Philippines. However, American historians examining official records report no agreement was ever made‚Äîthe two men discussed current events but came to no new policy or agreement. They both restated the well-known official policies of their own governments. Indeed, Taft was very careful to indicate these were his private opinions, and he was not an official representative of the U.S. government (Taft was Secretary of War, not Secretary of State). Details The Taft‚ÄìKatsura Memorandum consists of the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes of the conversation between Prime Minister Katsura and Secretary of War Taft, held in Tokyo on the morning of 27 July 1905. The memorandum detailing these discussions was dated 29 July 1905. Three significant issues were discussed during the meeting: * First were Katsura's views on peace in East Asia, which according to him formed the fundamental principle of Japan's foreign policy and was best accomplished by a good understanding among Japan, the United States, and Great Britain. * The second issue concerned the Philippines. On this, Taft observed that it was in Japan's best interests to have the Philippines governed by a strong and friendly nation like the United States; Katsura claimed that Japan had no aggressive designs on the Philippines. * Finally, regarding Korea, Katsura observed that Japanese colonization of Korea was a matter of absolute importance, as he considered Korea to have been a direct cause of the just- concluded Russo-Japanese War. Katsura stated that a comprehensive solution of the Korea problem would be the war's logical outcome. Katsura further stated that, if left alone, Korea would continue to improvidently enter into agreements and treaties with other powers, which he said created the original problem. Therefore, Katsura stated that Japan must take steps to prevent Korea from again creating conditions which would force Japan into fighting another foreign war. For his part, Taft concurred that the establishment of a Japanese protectorate over Korea would directly contribute to stability in East Asia. Taft also expressed his belief that President Roosevelt would concur in his views in this regard. There were three substantive areas of understanding in the conversation. First, Taft said to Katsura that some pro-Russians in America were publicly claiming that the recent war between Japan and Russia was a certain prelude to aggression by Japan against the Philippine Islands. Taft stated that Japan's only interest in the Philippines would be to have these islands governed by a strong and friendly nation like the United States. Count Katsura strongly confirmed that this was Japan's only interest in the Philippines, and it already being the case, Japan had no aggressive interest toward the Philippines. Second, Count Katsura stated that Japan's policy in East and Southeast Asia was to maintain general peace, and that the means of achieving this was a good understanding between Japan, the United States, and Great Britain. Third, Count Katsura stated that because Korean autonomy resulted in Korea improvidently entering into agreements and treaties with other powers, this was the cause of international complications leading to the war between Japan and Russia. Japan therefore felt constrained to preclude any possibility of Korean autonomy. Secretary Taft stated that the establishment of a suzerainty of Japan over Korea (i.e., the less powerful Korea would pay tribute to or be somewhat controlled by the more powerful Japan), with Japanese military troops ensuring a requirement that Korea enter into no foreign treaties without the consent of Japan, was a logical result of the war, and would contribute to permanent peace in the East. Taft stated that his opinions were his own, but he believed that President Roosevelt would concur. Although there was never a signed agreement or secret treaty, only a memorandum of a conversation, and the conversations were kept secret for 20 years, President Theodore Roosevelt commented to his war Secretary Taft \\"Your conversation with Count Katsura (sic) absolutely correct in every respect. Wish (sic) that you would state to Katsura that I confirm every word you said.\\" Yet, there is controversy among historians as to the historic significance of the conversation and as to whether the language of the conversation constituted an actual agreement in Realpolitik (i.e., an actual agreement was implied by the use of the language of diplomacy, although not made explicit as a formal agreement). The notes of the conversation were discovered in 1924 by historian Tyler Dennett. Dennett considered the notes to be of first rate significance, and asked permission for publication from Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Dennett referred to the notes as \\"President Roosevelt's Secret Pact With Japan\\". Context The Japanese were at war with Russia and had just destroyed two thirds of the Russia naval fleet in their war over Korea in 1905. Victory by Japan was clearly imminent. Roosevelt was trying to bring Russia and Japan to peace negotiations. The United States had obtained control of the Philippines from its war with Spain in 1898. War Secretary Taft stopped by in Japan on his way to the Philippines. Korean reaction Korean historians (e.g., Ki-baik Lee, author of A New History of Korea, (Harvard U. Press, 1984) believe that the Taft‚ÄìKatsura Agreement violated the Korean‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Amity and Commerce signed at Incheon on May 22, 1882 because the Joseon Government considered that treaty constituted a de facto mutual defense treaty while the Americans did not. The problem was the Article 1 stating that \\"There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between the President of the United States and the King of Chosen and the citizens and subjects of their respective Governments. If other powers deal unjustly or oppressively with either Government, the other will exert their good offices on being informed of the case to bring about an amicable arrangement, thus showing their friendly feelings\\". The Agreement has been cited in Korea by some as an example that the United States cannot be trusted with regards to Korean security and sovereignty issues.Yun Ho-u Ïú§Ìò∏Ïö∞, \\"'Katcheura-Taepeuteu Miryak'eun hyeonjae jinhaenghyeong\\" 'Í∞ÄÏØîÎùº-ÌÉúÌîÑÌä∏ Î∞ÄÏïΩ'ÏùÄ ÌòÑÏû¨ÏßÑÌñâÌòï (Katsura-Taft Agreement Is Present Progressive), Gyeonghyang dat keom Í≤ΩÌñ•Îã∑Ïª¥ (Kyunghyang.com), September 6, 2005 (in Korean).

History Designed by Robert Cromie (also renovated the Prince of Wales Theatre )in Art Deco style, it opened in 1932 as the Gaumont Palace, being renamed the Hammersmith Odeon in 1962. It has had a string of names and owners, most recently AEG Live and Eventim UK. Hammersmith Apollo, 2008 The venue was opened in 1932 as the Gaumont Palace and seated nearly 3,500 people. It was designed by Robert Cromie in the Art Deco style. In 1962, the building was renamed Hammersmith Odeon, a name many people still use for the venue. It became a Grade II listed building in 1990. The venue was later refurbished and renamed Labatt's Apollo following a sponsorship deal with Labatt Brewing Company (1993 or 1994). In 2002, the venue was again renamed, this time to Carling Apollo after Carling brewery struck a deal with the owners, US-based Clear Channel Entertainment (spun off as Live Nation (Venues) UK Ltd in 2005). The venue's listing was upgraded to Grade II* status in 2005. In 2003, the stalls seats were made removable and now some concerts have full seating whilst others have standing-only in the stalls. In the latter format the venue can accommodate around 5,000 people. The event was marked by rock band AC/DC playing an exclusive one-off concert and only charging ¬£10 per ticket. All 5,000 tickets sold out in 4 minutes. In 2006, the venue reverted to its former name, the Hammersmith Apollo. In 2007, the original 1932 Compton pipe organ, still present from the building's days as a cinema, was restored. The building then changed hands and was bought by the MAMA Group. On 14 January 2009, a placing announcement by HMV Group revealed that by selling additional shares, the company would raise money to fund a joint venture with the MAMA Group, to run eleven live music venues across the United Kingdom, including the Hammersmith Apollo. As a result, the venue was named HMV Apollo from 2009 until 2012. Other venues purchased include The Forum in London's Kentish Town, the Birmingham Institute and Aberdeen's Moshulu. The venue was sold by HMV Group in May 2012 to AEG Live and CTS Eventim. In 2013, the venue was closed for an extensive refurbishment which was carried out by award-winning architect Foster Wilson. The venue reopened as the Eventim Apollo on 7 September 2013, with a concert performance by Selena Gomez.  The Compton pipe organ  Restored organ, 2007 The original 1932 Compton pipe organ is still present at the Apollo and was fully restored to playing condition in 2007. It has a four-manual console which rises through the stage on a new lift and about 1,200 organ pipes housed in large chambers above the front stalls ceiling. Having fallen into disrepair, the organ was disconnected in the 1990s and the console removed from the building. At the insistence of English Heritage and the local council, however, it was reinstated and the entire organ restored. At a launch party, on 25 July 2007, an invited audience and media representatives witnessed a recital by Richard Hills.  In popular culture  left Many bands have released live albums, videos or DVDs of concerts held at the Apollo, such as Queen, Black Sabbath, Rush, Hawkwind, Iron Maiden, Celtic Frost, Kings of Leon, Tears for Fears, Dire Straits, Frank Zappa, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Erasure, Spear of Destiny, Mot√∂rhead, and Robbie Williams.

In many ways, his role was similar to that of Cecil Rhodes elsewhere in Africa Early life George Goldie descended from an old Scottish family. Born at The Nunnery, Douglas in the Isle of Man, the youngest son of Lieutenant Colonel John Taubman Goldie-Taubman, Speaker of the House of Keys, by his second wife Caroline Everina, daughter of John Eykyn Hovenden, a barrister of Hemingford Grey, Huntingdonshire. Sir George resumed his paternal name, Goldie, by Royal Licence in 1887. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and for about two years held a commission in the Royal Engineers. Unusually for the time, Goldie was a convinced atheist.David Grann -The Lost City of Z (Pocket Books, 2010) p.71 He married, in 1870, Matilda ('Maude') Catherine (died 1898), daughter of John William Elliott of Wakefield. He travelled in all parts of Africa, gaining an extensive knowledge of the continent, and first visited the country of the Niger in 1877. The National African Company He conceived the idea of adding to the British Empire the then little known regions of the lower and middle Niger, and for over twenty years his efforts were devoted to the realization of this conception. The method by which he determined to work was the revival of government by chartered companies within the empire, a method supposed to be buried with the British East India Company. The first step was to combine all British commercial interests in the Niger, and this he accomplished in 1879 when the United African Company was formed. In 1881, Goldie sought a charter from Gladstone's government. Objections of various kinds were raised. To meet them the capital of the company (renamed the National African Company) was increased from ¬£250,000 to ¬£1,000,000, and great energy was displayed in founding stations on the Niger. At this time French traders, encouraged by L√©on Gambetta, established themselves on the lower river, thus rendering it difficult for the company to obtain territorial rights; but the Frenchmen were bought out in 1884, so that at the Berlin Conference on West Africa in 1885, Goldie, present as an expert on matters relating to the river, was able to announce that on the lower Niger the British flag alone flew. Meantime the Niger coast line had been placed under British protection. Through Joseph Thomson, David McIntosh, D. W. Sargent, J. Flint, William Wallace, E. Dangerfield and numerous other agents, over 400 political treaties drawn up by Goldie were made with the chiefs of the lower Niger and the Hausa states. The scruples of the British government being overcome, a charter was at length granted (July 1886), the National African Company becoming the Royal Niger Company, with Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare as governor and Goldie as vice-governor. In 1895, on Lord Aberdare's death, Goldie became governor of the company, whose destinies he had guided throughout. German opposition The building up of Nigeria as a British state had to be carried on in face of further difficulties raised by French travellers with political missions, and also in face of German opposition. From 1884 to 1890, Otto von Bismarck was a persistent antagonist, and the strenuous efforts he made to secure for Germany the basin of the lower Niger and Lake Chad were even more dangerous to Goldie's schemes of empire than the ambitions of France. Eduard Robert Flegel, who had travelled in Nigeria during 1882‚Äì1884 under the auspices of the British company, was sent out in 1885 by the newly formed German Colonial Society to secure treaties for Germany, which had established itself at Cameroon. After Flegel's death in 1886, his work was continued by his companion Dr Staudinger, while Herr Hoenigsberg was despatched to stir up trouble in the occupied portions of the Company's territory, or, as he expressed it, \\"to burst up the charter\\". He was finally arrested at Onitsha, and, after trial by the company's supreme court at Asaba, was expelled from the country. Bismarck then sent out his nephew, Herr von Puttkamer, as German consul general to Nigeria, with orders to report on this affair, and when, this report was published in a White Book, Bismarck demanded heavy damages from the company. Meanwhile, Bismarck maintained constant pressure on the British government to compel the Royal Niger Company to a division of spheres of influence, whereby Great Britain would have lost a third, and the most valuable part, of the company's territory. But he fell from power in March 1890 and, in July, following Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, concluded the Heligoland‚ÄìZanzibar Treaty with Germany. The aggressive action of Germany in Nigeria entirely ceased, and the door was opened for a final settlement of the Nigeria‚ÄìCameroon frontiers. These negotiations, which resulted in an agreement in 1893, were initiated by Goldie as a means of arresting the advance of France into Nigeria from the direction of the Congo. By conceding to Germany a long but narrow strip of territory between Adamawa and Lake Chad, to which she had no treaty claims, a barrier was raised against French expeditions, semi-military and semi-exploratory, which sought to enter Nigeria from the east. Later French efforts at aggression were made from the western or Dahomeyan side, despite an agreement concluded with France in 1890 respecting the northern frontier. The end of the Company The hostility of certain Fula princes led the company to despatch, in 1897, an expedition against the Muslim states of Nupe and Ilorin. This expedition was organized and personally directed by Goldie and was completely successful. Internal peace was thus secured, but in the following year the differences with France in regard to the frontier line became acute, and compelled the intervention of the British government. In the negotiations which ensued Goldie was instrumental in preserving for Great Britain the whole of the navigable stretch of the lower Niger. It was, however, evidently impossible for a chartered company to hold its own against the state-supported protectorates of France and Germany, and in consequence, on 1 January 1900, the Royal Niger Company transferred its territories to the British government for the sum of ¬£865,000. The ceded territory together with the small Niger Coast Protectorate, already under imperial control, was formed into the two protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria. Later enterprises In 1903‚Äì1904, at the request of the Chartered Company of South Africa, Goldie visited Rhodesia and examined the situation in connection with the agitation for self-government by the Rhodesians. In 1902‚Äì1903 he was one of the Royal Commissioners who inquired into the military preparations for the war in South Africa (1899‚Äì1902) and into the operations up to the occupation of Pretoria, and in 1905‚Äì1906 was a member of the Royal Commission which investigated the methods of disposal of war stores after peace had been made. Gravestone, Brompton Cemetery, London Later life Sir George Goldie died in 1925 and is buried in London. He was survived by two children. His wife's name on the tombstone is Lady Maude Goldie, reflecting her evident use of an alternative form of the name originating in Old German, 'Matilda' being the Latin form; the same was the case with the Empress Matilda.The Artistry and Tradition of Tennyson's Battle Poetry, Timothy J. Lovelace, 2004, Routledge, ch. 5 Honours In 1905 he was elected President of the Royal Geographical Society and held that office for three years. In 1908 he was chosen as an Alderman of the London County Council. Goldie was created KCMG in 1887, and a Privy Councillor in 1898. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society(1902), Honorary D.C.L. of the University of Oxford (1897) and Honorary LL.D. of the University of Cambridge (1897). In 1906 he was awarded the RSGS Livingstone Medal for his contribution to GeographyRSGS memorial to medal recipients, Perth Sir George was also at some point Vice President of the Royal Colonial Institute. *Pseudohaje goldii (Goldie's tree cobra), a rare West African venomous snake, was named in Goldie's honour by George Albert Boulenger in 1895.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Goldie\\", p. 103).

The programs can either be an independent institution or a part of an existing educational institution. Many Chinese schools are purposed to preserve traditional Chinese language and culture. In 2007, USA Today dubbed Chinese \\"... is the new English.\\" A recent trend in 2011 shows that the Chinese government has also provided funding to U.S. school districts with additional funding on top of funding they already receive from the U.S. government. As a result, there has also been concern that the Chinese government may also be infiltrating the education system outside its borders, as some people at a school district in Columbus, Ohio, feel it has done. Curriculum A typical Chinese school curriculum can vary depending on the particular school. However, the Standard Chinese language and various aspects of Chinese culture such as Chinese art, Chinese history and Chinese martial arts are typically included. =Chinese language= Most native speakers of English find these sounds difficult. The Chinese language is spoken by nearly 1.2 billion people or about 16% of the world's population. Chinese schools typically teach both written and spoken Chinese. With the growing importance and influence of China's economy globally, Mandarin instruction is gaining popularity in schools in the United States, and has become an increasingly popular subject of study amongst the young in the Western world, as in the UK. One of the teaching tools used widely in Chinese schools is the Pinyin system, also known as the official phonetic system for transcribing the Mandarin pronunciations of Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet which was developed in the 1950s based on earlier forms of romanization. It was published by the Chinese government in 1958 and revised several times. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted pinyin as an international standard in 1982. =Chinese calligraphy= Calligraphy tools Written Chinese as taught in Chinese schools uses methods as defined by the Sh≈´f«é (Êõ∏Ê≥ï) from China, which means \\"the way/method/law of writing\\".Êõ∏ being here used as in Ê•∑‰π¶/Ê•∑Êõ∏, etc, and meaning \\"writing style\\". Curricula in Chinese writing typically focus on stroke order and repetition. Schools also teach the relationship of words based on their Chinese radicals, as many words come from ideas that relate to a particular topic. Stroke orders of words are also important as they dictate how Chinese words can be found in a Chinese dictionary. =Chinese art= Chinese art is taught in Chinese schools following the techniques as established in Chinese painting. For example: * Gong-bi (Â∑•Á≠Ü), meaning \\"meticulous\\", uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely. It is often highly coloured and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects. It is often practised by artists working for the royal court or in independent workshops. Bird-and-flower paintings were often in this style. * Ink and wash painting, in Chinese Shui-mo or (Ê∞¥Â¢®The Chinese character \\"mo\\" means ink and \\"shui\\" means water) also loosely termed watercolour or brush painting, and also known as \\"literati painting\\", as it was one of the \\"Four Arts\\" of the Chinese Scholar-official class.Sickman, 222 In theory this was an art practised by gentlemen, a distinction that begins to be made in writings on art from the Song dynasty, though in fact the careers of leading exponents could benefit considerably.Rawson, 114-119; Sickman, Chapter 15 This style is also referred to as \\"xie yi\\" (ÂØ´ÊÑè) or freehand style. =Chinese martial arts= Chinese martial arts, sometimes called \\"kung fu\\" are a number of fighting styles that have developed over the centuries in China. Chinese schools often offer such programs as part of their curriculum as it is one of the fundamental aspects of Chinese culture. Though some martial art styles may have originated in other parts of Asia such as karate and tae kwon do, they are sometimes taught as though it were part of the Chinese heritage. Major events =Chinese New Year= Many Chinese schools put on a Chinese New Year gala as the festival is an important Chinese festival celebrated at the turn of the Chinese calendar. It is also known as the Spring Festival, the literal translation of the modern Chinese name. Chinese New Year celebrations traditionally run from Chinese New Year's Eve, the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first month, making the festival the longest in the Chinese calendar. The first day of the New Year falls between January 21 and February 20. See also * Chinese as a foreign language Other cultures and languages have similar setups.

It was named after a Governor of Queensland, Sir George Ferguson Bowen. At the 2016 Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 3,266. History View of Bowen Hills c. 1883 Suburb in flood, 1893 Before white settlement Bowen Hills was occupied by the indigenous Chepara people including the Brisbane, Ipswich and southern Jagera people. The higher parts were named Barrambin meaning windy place because they caught the breezes.Kerkhove, Ray, Aboriginal Camp Sites of Greater Brisbane A Historical Guide, 2014, Publication supported by Brisbane City Council It was one of the main campsites for the region, part of the Spring Hill, City area, where on occasions 700 to 1000 people were camped, including Brisbane locals, groups from Ipswich, the Tweed Valley, Wivenhoe, Rosewood, Logan, Stradbroke, North Pine and beyond. The area now occupied by the grounds of the Brisbane Exhibition Ground and Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital was named Walan (Woolan), meaning Bream (fish). The area of the present main Ekka oval was a \\"great fighting ground for the blacks\\" . Barrambin was an important location for \\"kippa-ring\\" or initiation ceremony. Tribes from the coast would travel here to have their \\"kippa's\\" (young men) initiated. Early European settlement named the area beside Gilchrist Avenue York's Hollow. The Queensland Acclimatisation Society occupied Bowen Park in 1862, the area later known as the RNA Exhibition Grounds and home to the Brisbane Ekka.Brisbane's Rich History In 1866 Bowen Hills was defined as a postal district.

In 2007 AFF was one of the 100 most popular sites in the United States; its competitors include sites such as Match.com. History In 1994, Andrew Conru created the first online dating site, WebPersonals. After selling that site in 1995, he launched FriendFinder.com, an early social networking site, in 1996. Days after the site went live, Conru found that people were posting naked pictures of themselves and seeking partners for adult-oriented activities. As a result, Conru started Adult FriendFinder, which he described as \\"a release valve\\". FriendFinder has since established other niche dating sites, including Senior FriendFinder, Amigos.com, BigChurch.com, and Alt.com. The parent company (Various, Inc.) had difficulty finding venture capital due to the adult nature of its business. In December 2007, the company was sold to the Penthouse Media Group for $500 million. Penthouse later changed its name to FriendFinder Networks. In October 2009, as part of an arrangement with The Kluger Agency, musician Flo Rida released a music video for his song \\"Touch Me\\" via Adult FriendFinder. A representative of the agency stated that it was \\"always great to combine a very sexy high octane record with a very sexy brand. On September 17, 2013, parent company FriendFinder Networks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In December 2013, FriendFinder Networks emerged from bankruptcy protection with reorganization in effect. Founder Andrew Conru gained control of the company and serves as CEO. Overview Accessing certain features, such as e-mail, private chat rooms, webcams, blogging, and a webzine, requires paid membership. Adult FriendFinder has an affiliate program, whereby webmasters are compensated for referring users to the site. Criticism Adult FriendFinder has been accused of committing systematic billing fraud. According to the complaints filed, the company has a practice of continuing to bill customers even after they have cancelled their service. Former employees of the company have claimed that this is their standard policy and not the result of errors. These employees have stated that the majority of customers do not notice the charges for many months. As of October 2014, hundreds of civil cases have been filed against the company and a criminal indictment was made by the Federal Trade Commission against the company. In 2007, Adult FriendFinder settled with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that the company had used malware to generate explicit pop-up ads for the service on computers without user consent. Adult FriendFinder's acquisition by Penthouse was the subject of a 2007 lawsuit by Broadstream Capital Partners, a merchant bank that assists with mergers, alleging Penthouse breached a 2006 contract by purchasing the company without obtaining Broadstream's consent, a claim Penthouse denies. The suit was settled for $15 million in 2011.  Security breaches  In May 2015, Adult FriendFinder was hacked by users associated with the Hell forums, with the hackers stealing personal information about as many as four million of the site's users. On November 13, 2016, it was reported that a database of usernames, e-mails, and passwords had been breached and leaked from Adult FriendFinder and other FriendFinder Networks websites. The breach included 300 million Adult FriendFinder user accounts, including account data for 15 million accounts that had supposedly been \\"deleted\\". The passwords had not been encrypted at all, or even hashed with the obsolete and insecure SHA-1 hashing algorithm. Awards The site won the 2010 XBIZ Award for \\"Dating Program of the Year\\". It was also voted Best Adult Dating Site of 2012 from About.com.

Established in 1984 as Operation Raleigh, 40,000 young people have been part of a Raleigh expedition. Raleigh International's work Raleigh International operates in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Nepal and Tanzania, with permanent offices in these countries. Long-term partnerships have been established with local communities, NGOs and government departments, ensuring projects are needed and sustainable. Past countries have included Chile, Ghana, Namibia, Malaysia, Mongolia and Fiji. All volunteers are trained and supported to work alongside communities living in poverty. They work in remote, rural areas to improve access to safe water and sanitation, build community resilience, to sustainably manage natural resources and to protect vulnerable environments. This is carried out in a number of ways, through raising awareness of health and hygiene, sustainable farming methods, as well as construction of early childhood development centres, community buildings, rocket stoves and other infrastructure. =Expeditions= Raleigh International runs expeditions in Costa Rica,Tanzania and Nepal for individuals aged 17‚Äì75, of any nationality or background. Volunteers (aged 17‚Äì24) work on community and environmental projects as well as undertaking a tough adventure challenge, and are supported by volunteer managers (aged 25‚Äì75).

The programme comprises two opportunities, ICS and ICS Entrepreneur. UK volunteers aged 18‚Äì25 spend 10‚Äì12 weeks in Nepal, Nicaragua or Tanzania working alongside local volunteers on community development projects. History Colonel John Blashford-Snell and Prince Charles launched Operation Drake in 1978, running youth projects from ships circumnavigating the globe, to develop self-confidence and leadership through adventure, scientific exploration and community service. In two years 414 young people took part in the round the world voyage, working on land- based projects in 16 countries. Following the success of Operation Drake, the much more ambitious Operation Raleigh was established in 1984, and ran for four years until 1988. Two renovated ships - Sir Walter Raleigh and Zebu - carried 4,000 volunteers and almost 1,600 staff to take part in expeditions around the world. The success of Operation Raleigh saw it continue on a permanent basis in 1988, with an emphasis on land-based expeditions. It became Raleigh International in 1992, reflecting the growing diversity of expedition volunteers. Today over 40,000 people have been part of a Raleigh programme, and Raleigh continues to work with young people alongside communities living in poverty across the world.

With the changes in the local economy in Plymouth over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, from the Royal Navy being the major employer to being a university city housing a large number of students from outside the city, the term has developed an additional secondary pejorative sense describing the locals. The Member of Parliament for Plymouth, Devonport, Alison Seabeck, showed her ignorance of the term in 2005 when, while still a candidate, she was asked by the local paper: \\"What is a Janner?\\" The Express on Sunday reported her reply: > The flustered candidate wailed: \\"I don't know. You're not going to print > this, are you?\\" Unfortunately they did. The answer is a \\"Plymothian\\". For many years there was a cartoon in the Plymouth Evening Herald entitled 'The Janners'. Many pamphlets circulate with mischievous amusing and sometimes erotic anthologies and there are short dictionaries of Janner vocabulary, e.g. the Janner TextBook.This example is at The term features in the football team Plymouth Argyle supporters' chants, particularly its variant on the folksong Oggy Land,151 Plymouth chants Footballchants.org and in 2010 it was used in a television advertisement for Aviva Car Insurance in which Paul Whitehouse as a Plymouth Argyle supporter driving to an away match exhorts a potential passenger to \\"get on you janner\\".Janner reference in television advertisement for Aviva Car Insurance via YouTube In April 2012 a new rugby league trophy called the Barum Janner cup was introduced for competition matches between Barnstaple's North Devon Raiders and the Plymouth Titans.

Its underlying principles may also be applied in a variety of clinical situations. In Fick's original method, the \\"organ\\" was the entire human body and the marker substance was oxygen. The first published mention was in conference proceedings from July 9, 1870 from a lecture he gave at that conference NB: summary of his principle is under point (4) of the proceedings.; it is this publishing that is most often used by articles to cite Fick's contribution. The principle may be applied in different ways. For example, if the blood flow to an organ is known, together with the arterial and venous concentrations of the marker substance, the uptake of marker substance by the organ may then be calculated. Variables In Fick's original method, the following variables are measured: \\\\- \\"Indirect Measurement of Cardiac Output\\" *VO2, oxygen consumption in ml of pure gaseous oxygen per minute. This may be measured using a spirometer within a closed rebreathing circuit incorporating a CO2 absorber *Ca, the oxygen content of blood taken from the pulmonary vein (representing oxygenated blood)Arterial blood *Cv, the oxygen content of blood from an intravenous cannula (representing deoxygenated blood) Equation From these values, we know that: :VO_2 = (CO \\\\times\\\\ C_a) - (CO \\\\times\\\\ C_v) where *CO = Cardiac Output *Ca = Oxygen content of arterial blood *Cv = Oxygen content of mixed venous blood This allows us to say :CO = \\\\frac{VO_2}{C_a - C_v} and hence calculate cardiac output. Note that (Ca ‚Äì Cv) is also known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference. Assumed Fick determination In reality, this method is rarely used due to the difficulty of collecting and analysing the gas concentrations. However, by using an assumed value for oxygen consumption, cardiac output can be closely approximated without the cumbersome and time-consuming oxygen consumption measurement. This is sometimes called an assumed Fick determination. A commonly used value for O2 consumption at rest is 125 ml O2 per minute per square meter of body surface area. Underlying principles The Fick principle relies on the observation that the total uptake of (or release of) a substance by the peripheral tissues is equal to the product of the blood flow to the peripheral tissues and the arterial-venous concentration difference (gradient) of the substance. In the determination of cardiac output, the substance most commonly measured is the oxygen content of blood thus giving the arteriovenous oxygen difference, and the flow calculated is the flow across the pulmonary system. This gives a simple way to calculate the cardiac output: : \\\\text{Cardiac Output} = \\\\frac {\\\\text{oxygen consumption}} {\\\\text{arteriovenous oxygen difference}} Assuming there is no intracardiac shunt, the pulmonary blood flow equals the systemic blood flow. Measurement of the arterial and venous oxygen content of blood involves the sampling of blood from the pulmonary artery (low oxygen content) and from the pulmonary vein (high oxygen content). In practice, sampling of peripheral arterial blood is a surrogate for pulmonary venous blood. Determination of the oxygen consumption of the peripheral tissues is more complex. The calculation of the arterial and venous oxygen concentration of the blood is a straightforward process. Almost all oxygen in the blood is bound to hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells. Measuring the content of hemoglobin in the blood and the percentage of saturation of hemoglobin (the oxygen saturation of the blood) is a simple process and is readily available to physicians. Using the fact that each gram of hemoglobin can carry 1.34 ml of O2, the oxygen content of the blood (either arterial or venous) can be estimated by the following formula: : \\\\text{Oxygen Content of blood} = \\\\left [\\\\text{Hb} \\\\right] \\\\left ( \\\\text{g/dl} \\\\right ) \\\\ \\\\times\\\\ 1.34 \\\\left ( \\\\text{ml}\\\\ O_2 /\\\\text{g of Hb} \\\\right ) \\\\times\\\\ O_2^{\\\\text{saturation fraction}} +\\\\ 0.0032\\\\ \\\\times\\\\ P_{O_2} (\\\\text{torr}) Assuming a hemoglobin concentration of 15 g/dl and an oxygen saturation of 99%, the oxygen concentration of arterial blood is approximately 200 ml of O2 per L. The saturation of mixed venous blood is approximately 75% in health. Using this value in the above equation, the oxygen concentration of mixed venous blood is approximately 150 ml of O2 per L. Therefore, using the assumed Fick determination, the approximated cardiac output for an average man (1.9 m¬≤) is: Cardiac Output = (125 ml O2/minute x 1.9) / (200 ml O2/L - 150 ml O2/L) = 4.75 L/minute Cardiac output may also be estimated with the Fick principle using production of carbon dioxide as a marker substance. Use in renal physiology The principle can also be used in renal physiology to calculate renal blood flow. \\\\- \\"Measuring Renal Blood Flow: Fick Principle\\" In this context, it is not oxygen which is measured, but a marker such as para- aminohippurate. However, the principles are essentially the same.

The primary transmitter is located at Belmont and covers East Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and north west Norfolk. Services =Television= The regional output of BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire consists of the flagship Look North, the topical magazine programme Inside Out and a twenty-minute opt-out during Sunday Politics. The region also airs the Super League Show, produced by PDI Media at BBC Yorkshire's studio in Leeds and simulcast in the North West and in the North East and Cumbria. =Radio= The region is the controlling centre for the local radio stations BBC Radio Humberside and BBC Radio Lincolnshire Both radio stations simulcast some programming from each other, the radio stations in the BBC Yorkshire region, and with BBC Radio 5 Live. =Online and Interactive= BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire also produces regional news & local radio pages for BBC Red Button and BBC Local News websites for each county. History Announced as part of the BBC's 'Project Hull' investment in October 2001, BBC Yorks and Lincs began as a seven-minute opt-out on the Belmont transmitter of the main Look North programme from Leeds, presented by Clare Frisby and the late bulletin following the Ten O'Clock News. On 11 November 2002, the Look North programme for the region launched as a full programme presented by Peter Levy and Helen Fospero. The programme expanded into new headquarters in April 2004, and the BBC Yorkshire and BBC Yorks and Lincs region became officially separate. BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire's first Head of Regional and Local Programmes (HRLP) was Helen Thomas, appointed in March 2004. In November 2006, Helen Thomas became HRLP of BBC Yorkshire in Leeds, and Catherine Hearne was appointed HRLP of BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. She took up her post in January 2007, but left to go to BBC West Midlands. The first Editor of Look North was Roger Farrant, whose departure to Bristol led to the appointment of Steven Punter as Editor in November 2004. Punter left the BBC soon after. Dave Betts ran Look North from 2006 until June 2007. Mark Hayman replaced him as the region's first TV News Editor running an integrated team of journalists and technicians, but has since moved to BBC West Midlands. Studios BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire's Hull headquarters The first studios used by BBC Yorks and Lincs housed the opt-out service, launched in 2001, which operated from a studio above the Post Office in 9 Chapel Street, Hull. The small studios and team were enough to produce an opt-out, but when the time came in November 2002 to launch their own programme, the studio was noticeable for its size. It was so small that there was room for the desk only; other features such as weather had to be done elsewhere and played out on a screen in the studio. Eventually, to coincide with the separation of the service, a new studio complex was built and unveiled by Manor Property Group at Queen's Court in Queen's Gardens in 2005. The new studio complex housed the new, expanded service, with a central newsroom, a good sized studio for the Look North programme, as well as radio studios for BBC Radio Humberside. The region also has a news bureau in Lincoln.

Darwazi was one of five journalists to die while reporting on the Second Intifada between 2002 and 2003. Early life Nazeh Darwazi was born and raised in Nablus. Various accounts of his age were reported. He lived in Nablus with his wife Raeda and their five children. His funeral was reported to have attracted over a thousand people. Career Nazeh Darwazi worked for The Associated Press for two years. He was also a journalist for Palestinian television. Death Eighteen Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets and live fire, during clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian's throwing stones. Nazeh Darwazi was filming these fights between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the central Casbah district (Old City), when he was shot above his right eye. He was wearing a yellow jacket marked \\"press\\" and was with a group of around six journalists covering fights between the group of Palestinians and Israeli soldiers. The journalists said their group shouted in English and Hebrew making clear that they were with the media. Three people filmed the event, including a Reuters cameraman. At first the army claimed they were under attack by armed Palestinians who had been throwing explosives, but witnesses claimed the soldier shot the journalist in cold blood without any exchange of fire. Investigation Reporters Without Borders investigated the event and found that the army had not interviewed eyewitnesses. The soldiers had been questioned, but nobody was punished. Palestinian Authority stated that Israel had \\"committed a war crime\\" by \\"opening fire on journalists and other civilians\\". The Associated Press reported two Palestinian cameramen: Hassan Titi from Reuters and Sami al-Assi from a Palestinian station. Both cameramen said the soldier aimed at the journalists. Video footage taken by Reuters confirms a soldier kneeling by a tank pointing a rifle down the alley where the journalists were wearing the green bulletproof vests stating, Press. Nazeh Darwazeh fell to his death shortly after the soldier fired. The Israeli investigation claimed that Israeli soldiers had been shot at before returning fire when Darwazi was killed. Context A street scene of the Old City of Nablus.Some of the journalists who were killed during the Second Intifada include Raffaele Ciriello, Italian; and Imad Abu Zahra and Issam Tillawi, who were both Palestinian. Two weeks after the Darwazi killing, James Miller was also killed on 2 May 2003 by the Israel Defense Forces while making a film about the Second Intifada. Nazeh Darwazi was covering the Passover clashes in Nablus when he was killed. Israeli troops arrested several Palestinians in Nablus on suspicion of a planning a potential suicide attack during Passover. Three of the four were arrested around Casbah; the fourth turned himself in at a military checkpoint. In Rafah, five Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops during a raid of a nearby refugee camp in the southern Gaza strip. Twenty-seven people total were wounded in the raid. At the time, Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat was in a dispute with his handpicked prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, over the formation of a new government. Reaction On Monday April 23, 2003 in front of the international Red Cross headquarters in Al- Khalil district, a group of Palestinian journalists staged a sit-in to publicly declare their disgust with what happened. The Palestinian Authority accused the IDF of war crimes. Reporters Without Borders, which is based in France, urged President Jacques Chirac to bring the issue of journalist security and safety up when he met with Israeli Moshe Katzav in 2004. The Committee to Protect Journalists issued statement about Nazeh Darwazi's death. Joel Simon, CPJ, said, \\"We demand an immediate and thorough inquiry into the shooting death of Nazih Darwazeh and call on you to ensure that those responsible are swiftly brought to justice.\\" Nazeh Darwazi‚Äôs body was wrapped in the Palestinian and carried from the Rafidyeh hospital by representatives of the Palestinian press.

History A 1914 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Greenford The original Greenford station was opened by the Great Western Railway on 1 October 1904 on the joint \\"New North Main Line\\" (present-day Acton‚ÄìNortholt line). The present station, adjacent to the original, was designed by Brian Lewis and built in the Central line extension of the 1935-40 New Works Programme of the London Passenger Transport Board. It was completed by Frederick Francis Charles Curtis and opened on 30 June 1947 after delay due to World War II. Service at the original (\\"main-line\\") station was gradually reduced and it was closed in 1963. Operational responsibility for the station transferred from British Rail to London Transport with effect from 13 November 1967. The site of the old station for the New North Main Line can still be seen from inside Central line trains. The station today Greenford station is above ground level with an island platform for the Central line. A bay platform facing south-east between the Underground platforms serves the Greenford branch service operated by Great Western Railway. The branch line then continues south and joins the Great Western Main Line at . Platform 1 is for westbound Central line trains, and platform 3 for eastbound trains. The access to the platform via escalators takes passengers to the front of the train for westbound service, and the rear for eastbound service. The remaining wooden escalators at Greenford, removed in 2014 and replaced with an inclinator Greenford was the first London Underground station to have an escalator up to platforms above street level. Until 2014 it remained the final London Underground station with a wooden- treaded escalator in service; all other such escalators were previously converted to fully metal treads, or removed altogether from sub-surface Underground stations in the wake of the fatal 1987 King's Cross fire. The line between Greenford and West Ealing carries infrequent freight services from Paddington New Yard and sand traffic for Park Royal and is occasionally used by passenger services. In 2009, because of financial constraints, TfL decided to stop work on a project to provide step-free access at Greenford and five other stations, on the grounds that these were relatively quiet stations and some were already one or two stops away from an existing step-free station. ¬£3.9 million was spent on Greenford before the project was halted.

Cosme Dami√°n de Churruca y Elorza (Mutriku, 27 September 1761 - Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805) was a Basque Spanish noble, an Admiral of the Royal Spanish Armada, scientist and Mayor of Mutriku, who died at the Battle of Trafalgar while commanding the ship of the line San Juan Nepomuceno.  Biography  He received his early years education in the Seminary of Burgos. Then, he entered the School of Bergara. Once he finished his studies, he joined the Naval Academy of Cadiz in 1776, and got his degree in the Naval Academy of Ferrol in 1778, becoming a naval officer. In 1781, Cosme Dami√°n de Churruca, as an officer of the Spanish Navy, performed heroically in a siege of Gibraltar. Churruca's Death, oil on canvas by Eugenio √Ålvarez Dumont, Prado Museum In 1805, a few months before his death, Churruca married Mar√≠a Dolores Ruiz de Apodaca, niece of Juan Ruiz de Apodaca, in 1797. Do√±a Mar√≠a was only 19 when Churruca died.  Battle of Trafalgar  The squadron to which the San Juan was assigned sailed on 13 August from the port of Ferrol. General Gravina had given Churruca a place of honour, the head of the vanguard. Churruca completed his mission with the highest merit and upon his arrival to Cadiz, redoubled his efforts in training his recently recruited and inexperienced civilian crew. It was at this time he married Maria de los Dolores Ruiz de Apodaca, daughter of Brigadier don Vicente, and cousin of the duke of Venadito. Churruca's honorary left With the Spanish and French squadrons reunited in the port of Cadiz, they sailed on a course to Marticina, where they took the fort of Del Diamante and captured a British convoy consisting of 16 merchant ships; in these moments Villeneuve, the chief of the combined fleet, was informed of the presence of Nelson in the Antillas. Villeneuve now decided he had completed his objective, which was to draw British naval forces to the other shore of the Atlantic, so he decided to sail the combined fleet back to Ferrol. However, in the cape of Finisterre, he bumped into the squadron of Admiral Calder, where a battle ensued. The majority of the French squadron continued to Ferrol, while the remaining ships were left to fend for themselves. Their defeat is attributed to the indecision and poor command of the chief of the combined squadron, Villeneuve, by Napoleon, who upon reading reports of the battle said: \\"The Spanish have behaved like lions, while their admiral only offered curses.\\" The combined fleet entered Ferrol after the battle, proceeding in continuation to La Coru√±a. From this port, Villeneuve set a course to Cadiz, ignoring Napoleon‚Äôs order to go to Brest. Once there, despite the protests and opposing opinions of Churruca, Gravina and Alcal√°- Galiano, Villeneuve abandoned the Bay of C√°diz to reach Nelson at the Cape of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. Before sailing on 20 October, Churruca wrote to his brother: 21 October dawned, and in sight of the British fleet Churruca ordered the colours to be nailed to the mast, and ordered that they should not be taken down while he still lived. Under the command of Churruca, the San Juan Nepomuceno demonstrated military precision, daring and efficiency, despite finding itself alone against six English ships, including HMS Defiance, HMS Tonnant, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Dreadnought. After being reached by a cannonball which tore his leg, Churruca died with the admiration of his enemies, who displayed his vessel in Gibraltar to visitors with his name written in golden letters above the cabin, and advising those who would enter to remove their covers, as if don Cosme Dami√°n de Churruca y Elorza was still present. His officers kept their word, and only lowered the colours after his death. Unable to break the circle of fire and in order to prevent the vessel sinking with all wounded trapped below, the San Juan yielded with over 100 dead and 150 wounded on board. Legacy Churruca was posthumously promoted to admiral, and in his memory his cousin received the title Count of Churruca. The events to which Churruca was a protagonist, were novelised in 1872 by Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, in Trafalgar, the first title of his Episodios Nacionales. Statue of Churruca in Mutriku. A statue in his memory stands in his native Mutriku, as well as Ferrol, where a simple monument records his passing by the Academy. In San Fernando there is a stone in the third pulpit of the Panteon de Marinos Ilustres (Pantheon of Illustrious Sailors) which reads: After Trafalgar, the ship was taken to Gibraltar and entered British service, initially as , before her Spanish name was restored. In honour of Churruca's courage, his cabin bore his name on a brass plate, and all who entered were required to remove their hat as a mark of respect for a gallant enemy. HMS San Juan served as a supply hulk in Gibraltar until 1815, when she was broken up. Harbron, John D.

The highest peak of the table-top mountain is the Berchtesgaden Hochthron at . Geography The Untersberg rises at the rim of the Northern Limestone Alps, immediately at the Salzburg Basin and the broad Salzach Valley. Neighbouring peaks are the Hoher G√∂ll in the southeast and Mt. Watzmann in the south, beyond the Berchtesgaden Basin. In the northwest, the Saalach Valley with Bad Reichenhall separates it from the Hochstaufen massif of the Chiemgau Alps. About two-thirds of the area, including the Berchtesgaden Hochthron peak, is located in Germany, while the northernmost steep edge above Salzburg belongs to Austria. The mountain is a landmark popular with tourists, due to its proximity to the City of Salzburg: less than south of the city centre and within easy reach, e.g. by bus lines running to the southern suburbs of Gr√∂dig and Gro√ügmain. Several trails lead to the top, though most people prefer the Untersbergbahn cable car. Constructed over a period of over two years, and opening in April 1961, the eight and a half minute journey lifts passengers from the lower terminus at the village of Sankt Leonhard at over to the top station on the Geiereck spur at an altitude of , transporting them a horizontal distance of almost with a maximum height above the ground of .

Within it, the Upper Cretaceous Gosau Group is the source of a pale cream, rose to gray yellow, massive and very dense limestone known as the Untersberg Marble. This building stone is a fine to medium grained (partially breccious) arenite that forms the facade of notable buildings such as Salzburg Cathedral.Moshammer, B., Uhlir, C., Rohatsch, A. and Unterwurzacher, M., 2015.

The Riesending cave with a depth of and a length of is the largest known in Germany. There also is a lake at depth. An expedition in August 2008 revealed that its lowest point had not yet been reached. Legend Karl Girardet (1813 ‚Äì 1871): Fr√©d√©ric Barberousse dans la grotte de l'Untersberg First mentioned as Vndarnsperch (\\"Noon Mountain\\") in a 1306 deed issued by the Salzburg archbishops, the prominent spur has been the subject of numerous myths and legends. According to a popular king asleep in mountain legend, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa shall remain asleep inside Mt. Untersberg until his resurrection. His beard is said to be growing longer and longer around a round table and to have grown round two times. Myth says that when the beard has grown three times around the table the end of the world has come. When Frederick leaves the mountain, there will be no further Holy Roman Emperor and the last great battle of humankind will be fought at the pear tree on the Walserfeld, a pasture near Wals, west of Salzburg. There is a similar legend for the Kyffh√§user Mountain in Thuringia and Trifels Castle. Other legends say that it is Charlemagne waiting inside the Untersberg, taken care of by the Untersberger Mandln, small dwarf-like creatures. Every hundred years he awakes and when he sees the ravens (actually choughs) still flying around the Untersberg he sleeps for another century. Indeed, Charlemagne had held a synod in Salzburg in 803 AD, where he met with Bishop Arno. The Alpine tradition of the Untersberg Wild Hunt (Perchten) has recently been revived. There are also several legends about the cave system below the mountain.  In popular culture  The landmark gained international fame as the \\"distinctive, lopsided peak\\" featured at the beginning and end of the 1965 movie The Sound of Music, although the filming was done on the German side, not the Austrian side. It was where Julie Andrews sang The Hills Are Alive at the opening scene and where the family climbed the mountain on their escape to Switzerland at the end of the film. The mountain also lends its name to an 1829 opera, Der Untersberg, by Johann Nepomuk von Poi√ül (1783‚Äì1865). Marble ball mills Ball mills by Marktschellenberg Video The Untersberger marble ball mills are located in Marktschellenberg in Berchtesgaden, at the opening of the Almbachklamm valley. The Kugelm√ºhlen (ball mills) were established in 1683. Once popular children's toys, these marbles were shipped all over the world. Through Rotterdam and London, marble shipping was directed toward the East and West Indies and exported at the rate of 60,000 to 80,000 (and sometimes as high as 100,000) pounds per year. Marbles were welcome as cargo in sailing ships, as they were suitable as ballast because of their high density. The last marbles went from Untersberg to London in 1921. As late as the 1850s, the Almbach valley had 40 ball mills with another 90 in the surrounding region, worked mainly by poor mountain farmers. Today, a single ball mill operates primarily as a tourist attraction. The ball mills were driven by the waters of the Almbach river. The lower fixed grinding stones are made of hard sandstone and the upper turntables from beech wood. Grinding of the balls varies from two to eight days according to their size. After coarse grinding on the sandstone, the marble balls underwent sanding and a polish.

Nancor Cross, by a road junction east of Grampound William Gregor, the discoverer of titanium, was rector here. Dr. Reginald Merther-derwa was Rector 1423-47; his will provided for the erection of a series of stone crosses at Camborne. The five similar stone crosses in Creed parish, including one now at Grampound church, may also have been due to him.The Cornish Church Guide, p. 81 Merther- derwa's will says \\"New stone crosses to be put up of the usual kind in those parts of Cornwall from Kayar Reslasek to Camborne church where dead bodies are rested on the way to their burial, that prayers may be made and the bearers take some rest\\". As there are no Gothic stone crosses in Camborne or adjacent parishes it is likely that these crosses were set up at Creed instead. In Creed parish there are the remains of four 15th-century crosses, three of which were cut from Pentewan stone. The market cross of Grampound is more ornate than the other three crosses. Fair Cross is a Gothic cross shaft. Nancor Cross has a cross head which was found in the 1920s near Nancor Farm; it was later set on a new shaft and erected beside the A390 road.

After the war, he served as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, head of the Lighthouse Board, and commander-in-chief of the Squadron of Evolution and of the North Atlantic Squadron. In retirement, he led commissions to investigate the construction of a Central American canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Early life and career Born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, Walker was appointed a midshipman on 5 October 1850 and graduated at the head of his class at the Naval Academy in 1856. He served in and in 1858 and 1859; in in 1860 and 1861; in in 1861; and in in 1861 and 1862. Civil War service Walker distinguished himself under David Dixon Porter during the Mississippi River campaigns while serving in Winona, (which he commanded), and . He participated in the engagements with Forts Jackson and St. Philip, as well as the Chalmette batteries during the operations which resulted in the fall of New Orleans. He later took part in the Navy's operations against Vicksburg. During the winter of 1862 and 1863, Walker participated in the thrusts against Haines Bluff and Arkansas Post. He also took part in the Yazoo Pass Expedition, the attack on Fort Pemberton, and the capture of Yazoo City. At the siege of Vicksburg, Walker commanded the naval gun battery attached to the 15th Army Corps. His subsequent war service included operations which resulted in the capture of Fort Fisher, and he participated in the ensuing bombardments of Forts Anderson and Caswell on the Cape Fear River and in the capture of Wilmington, North Carolina. Post-Civil War service Promoted to commander in 1866, Walker served as Assistant Superintendent of the Naval Academy from 1866 to 1869. After commanding in 1869 and 1870--during which time he took the ship to Europe on a midshipman training cruise--he served as secretary to the Lighthouse Board from 1873 to 1878.

Walker was the subject of a feature article in the September 12, 1891 edition of the New York Times. The article detailed how, as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, Walker gave senior officers assignments beneath their abilities in hopes that they would retire from the Navy sooner and, thereby, enable Walker to get promoted faster.New York Times. September 12, 1891. Flag assignments Appointed rear admiral in 1894, he took the White Squadron to Hawaii in 1895 when a coup d'etat posed a threat to American interests. He received a commendation for his attitude of watchful waiting and his squadron's posture of readiness to respond to a possible emergency. Upon his return to shore duty in 1896, he headed the Lighthouse Board and concurrently chaired the committee investigating locations for deep-water harbors in southern California. Post-Navy activities Soon after retiring as a rear admiral in 1897, Walker was chosen to serve as President of the Nicaragua Canal Commission. Two years later, in 1899, he was appointed President of the congressional Isthmian Canal Commission to look into possible routes for a canal across the Central American isthmus.

On 1 June 2000, it was classified as an AOC product and was confirmed as an APO product on 22 August 2002. Chili pepper, originating in Central and South America, was introduced into France during the 16th century. After first being used medicinally, it became popular as a condiment and for the conservation of meats. It is now a cornerstone of Basque cuisine, where it has gradually replaced black pepper and it is a key ingredient in piperade.Larousse, p. 804. AOC espelette peppers are cultivated in the following communes: Ainhoa, Cambo-les-Bains, Espelette, Halsou, Itxassou, Jatxou, Larressore, Saint-P√©e-sur-Nivelle, Soura√Øde, and Ustaritz. They are harvested in late summer and, in September, characteristic festoons of pepper are hung on balconies and house walls throughout the communes to dry out. An annual pepper festival organized by Confr√©rie du Piment d'Espelette, held since 1968 on the last weekend in October, attracts some 20,000 tourists. This pepper attains a maximum grade of only 4,000 on the Scoville scale and is therefore considered only mildly hot. It can be purchased as festoons of fresh or dried peppers, as ground pepper, or pur√©ed or pickled in jars. For US consumers non-AOC espelette peppers grown and marketed in California may be fresher than imported AOC Espelette peppers. According to the Syndicat du Piment d‚ÄôEspelette, the cooperative formed to get the AOC designation, there are 160 producers of AOC Piment d'Espelette that plant and in 2014, they produced 203 tons of powdered Piment d'Espelette and 1300 tons of raw pepper,.

It sits astride the junction of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and Coventry Canal; at Fazeley Junction are a couple of multi storey mills. Fazeley is also adjacent to Drayton Manor, formerly the home of Robert Peel and now a theme park and zoo. The First Annual Fazeley Festival and Mile Oak Mile Charity hop took place on 15 September 2007. Sitting in the centre of Fazeley, the Town Hall opened in 1898 and was named the Victoria Memorial Hall, commemorating the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria, and James Eadie paid for both the cost of its construction, ¬£3,000, and the land on which it stands, having signalled his intentions in this respect in 1896. James Eadie intended that the Hall should benefit the inhabitants of Fazeley and help to promote their welfare. His vision was that the Hall would be used for public meetings, lectures and concerts and contain reading rooms. He even speculated that technical classes might some day be held \\"for the better training of workmen in their several crafts and industries.\\" This vision became a reality, meetings of all descriptions took place and winter entertainments were regularly well attended. There was a library and a reading room, classes were held in gymnastics and cookery, and an Evening Continuation School in horticulture attracted over 40 youngsters. In later years, silent movies were presented here, too. History The name Fazeley in its various spellings is found in documents dating back to 1135. All suggestions concerning its derivation propose that it comes from early Saxon language most take its meaning to be pasture land or pleasant pasture but another authority suggests it is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon faresleia which meant bulls pasture. The various spellings support this latter suggestion and certainly the land alongside the River Tame, being very flat, may well have been used for this purpose. Transport Fazeley sits astride the old Roman road of Watling Street, which is now much quieter following the move of the A5 road to run on a new course between Fazeley and Tamworth. Until 1904, Wilnecote Station in nearby Two Gates was known as Wilnecote and Fazeley. Governance =Fazeley Town Council= Fazeley Town Council consists of eleven elected councillors. Of the eleven councillors, eight are from the Conservative Party and three from the Labour Party. In May 2012, at 21 years of age, Councillor Rebecca James became the youngest person ever to hold the post of The Worshipful The Mayor of Fazeley and was Fazeley Town Council's youngest councillor at 18 years of age when she was elected in January 2009. The current Mayor of Fazeley is Cllr Brian Hoult. Fazeley Town Hall is used for both public and private events including, bingo, dancing, parties and carpet sales and Fazeley Town Council holds its meetings in the building. =Local authority= Despite bordering the District of Tamworth, Fazeley is part of the Lichfield District, of which Barry Gwilt and James Parton-Hughes are the elected representatives. Fazeley is also covered by Staffordshire County Council, with Alan White representing the area.

The term is used to differentiate these members ‚Äî who are either life peers or hereditary peers, although the hereditary right to sit in the House of Lords was abolished for all but ninety-two peers during the 1999 reform of the House of Lords ‚Äî from the Lords Spiritual, who sit in the House as a consequence of being bishops in the Church of England.  History  Membership in the Lords Temporal was once an entitlement of all hereditary peers, other than those in the peerage of Ireland. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, the right to membership was restricted to 92 hereditary peers. Since 2020, none of them are female; most hereditary peerages can be inherited only by men. Further reform of the House of Lords is a perennially- discussed issue in British politics. However, no additional legislation on this issue has passed the House of Commons since 1999. The Wakeham Commission, which debated the issue of lords' reform under then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, proposed making some of the Lords Temporal elected positions.Executive Summary of the Wakeham Report This plan, which was widely criticized, failed to advance in the House of Commons. Additional proposals were made under the coalition government of Prime Minister David Cameron to reduce the size of the House of Lords to 450, directly elect at least some of the Lords Temporal, and allow members of the House of Commons to run for election as Lords Temporal. None of these proposals passed.  Composition of the Lords Temporal  The Lords Temporal consist of a small number of hereditary peers and a much larger contingent of life peers. = Hereditary peers = The Lords Temporal has historically included several hundred hereditary peers (English peers as well as Scottish Lords of Parliament). Such hereditary offices can be created by the Crown and in modern times are usually created only under the advice of the Prime Minister. Holders of Scottish and Irish peerages were not always permitted to sit in the Lords. When Scotland united with England to form Great Britain in 1707, it was provided that the Scottish hereditary peers would only be able to elect 16 representative peers to sit in the House of Lords; the term of a representative was to extend until the next general election. A similar provision was enacted when Ireland merged with Great Britain in 1801 to form the United Kingdom; the Irish peers were allowed to elect 28 representatives, who were to retain office for life. Elections for Irish representatives ended in 1922, when most of Ireland became an independent state; elections for Scottish representatives ended with the passage of the Peerage Act 1963, under which all Scottish peers obtained seats in the Upper House. After the 1999 reform, only 92 hereditary peers remain as Lords Temporal. Two are the Earl Marshal and the Lord Great Chamberlain. Of the remaining ninety peers sitting in the Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage, 15 are elected by the whole House and 75 are chosen by fellow hereditary peers in the House of Lords, grouped by party.https://www.parliament.uk/site- information/glossary/hereditary-peers/ = Life peers = The largest group of Lords Temporal, and indeed of the whole House, are life peers. As of June 2019 there are 661 life peers. Life peerages rank only as barons or baronesses, and are created under the Life Peerages Act 1958. Like all other peers, life peers are created by the Crown, who acts on the advice of the Prime Minister or the House of Lords Appointments Commission. By convention, however, the Prime Minister allows leaders of other parties to nominate some life peers, to maintain political equilibrium. In 2000, the government announced it would set up an Independent Appointments Commission, under Lord Stevenson of Coddenham, to select fifteen so-called \\"people's peers\\" for life peerages. = Defunct groupings =  Law lords  Until the establishment of the Supreme Court in 2009, a subset of the Lords Temporal ‚Äì known as the Law Lords ‚Äì acted as the final court of appeal in the United Kingdom judicial system.

They were often compared to Blondie and were influenced by Morrissey, who himself was a fan of the group. The most prominent part of Echobelly's success formula was vocalist Sonya Madan, who was also the group's primary lyricist. Born in Delhi, India, before moving to England at the age of two, Madan had an unusual background for a pop star. Her rigid upbringing made rock music taboo for her as a youngster and she did not attend her first rock concert until she was in college. In 1990 she met Glenn Johansson, a guitarist from Sweden. In a radio interview with Janice Long, on BBC Radio Wales, in December 2017, she admitted that her parents had initially found it hard to accept her choice of career. Career In 1992, Madan and Johansson first met in a pub, with Sonya expressing her desire to sing in a band \\"I used to sing a lot as a child. I suppose I had a secret desire to sing\\", They soon teamed up with bass guitarist Alex Keyser and drummer Andy Henderson, who had previously played with PJ Harvey's band. Guitarist Debbie Smith, formerly of Curve, came on board in 1994. According to the Epic Records' website, the group came up with the name Echobelly from the notion of \\"being hungry for something\\". With Madan and Johansson serving as songwriters, they recorded their debut EP, Bellyache, on the independent Pandemonium label in late 1993. The favourable response to Bellyache helped Echobelly secure a recording contract with Rhythm King, which was then part of Epic. Once on board the label, the group released the \\"I Can't Imagine the World Without Me\\" single in June 1994. The group then recorded the album Everyone's Got One, which included the single Insomniac and reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart. The single was featured in the movie and soundtrack of Dumb and Dumber. As their music received more airplay, Echobelly won admiration from other artists as well. Madonna expressed interest in putting them on her Maverick label (existing contractual arrangements prevented that), and R.E.M. requested the group as the opening act for their upcoming tour. The band returned to the studio in 1995 to create their next album, On, produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, who had also produced Hole and Radiohead. Madan's lyrics often ventured into the seamy side of life, such as the milieu of prostitution and homelessness addressed in the song King of the Kerb. \\"I wanted to challenge myself as a lyricist on a different level on this album,\\" Madan said in Rolling Stone. \\"I want people to tell me what they thought the lyrics are about. I'm not a politician. I'm not interested in changing everybody around me. I'm interested in myself.\\" While many of the songs lamented the state of things, others on the On album celebrated the endless possibilities of the human spirit. In \\"Great Things\\", Madan sang \\"I want to do great things / I don't want to compromise / I want to know what love is / I want to know everything.\\" The album's mostly optimistic feel provides an intriguing contrast with its serious subject matter. As Pareles wrote, \\"Both music and lyrics examine the tension between order and liberty\\". Listeners in the UK responded favourably to the album, driving three singles from the release into the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart. Sales of the album rose to over 150,000 in the UK, nearly double that of Everyone's Got One. Health and legal problems interrupted the success of Echobelly in 1995 and 1996. Madan had a serious thyroid problem during her world tour that was potentially life-threatening, but was later cured. Bass guitarist James Harris joined after Keyser defected because of personal and artistic differences. The group also had disagreements with Rhythm King after the label moved to Arista. The band chose to stay with Epic. In 1996, Madan also ventured away from the group when she sang on a recording of the club band, Lithium. Smith left the band before the release of Lustra, which was issued in November 1997. A single from the album, \\"The World is Flat\\", was released in August of that year. A four-year hiatus was brought to an end in 2001 when the band returned with the Digit EP and their fourth album, People Are Expensive, which were released on their own Fry Up label. Two further singles, \\"Tell Me Why\\" and \\"Kali Yuga\\" (a remixed version of the album track) followed. In 2004, Echobelly released a fifth album ‚Äì again through their own Fry Up label, Gravity Pulls. 2009 acoustic show and future Madan and Johansson performed an acoustic show featuring brand new songs and older Echobelly songs in Manchester on 9 July 2009 at MoHo Live, supported by Spyglass. New material was demoed during this show which turned out to be part of an upcoming album that had already commenced recording which was to be co-produced and mixed by Jono Buchanan. \\"Silence on the Radio\\" and \\"Mind over Matter\\" were two songs previewed on the producer's website. The album was given the name I Seek Identity and was initially recorded under a new band name of \\"Calm of Zero\\". Alex Reeves was brought in to record the drumming and percussion for the album. Jono Buchanan later reported on 1 December 2009 via his Twitter account that he had spoken to \\"Glenn of Calm of Zero fame\\", who revealed that the new album was to be released under the band name Echobelly after all, to save potential confusion amongst fans. On 23 January however, Jono Buchanan advised ‚Äì again, via his Twitter account ‚Äì that the name \\"Calm of Zero\\" was to remain after all, making I Seek Identity the new venture's debut album. Although this album was yet to be released, Sonya and Glen released two EPs entitled Acoustic Sessions 1 in January 2011 and Acoustic Sessions 2 in October 2012. Another song, \\"Molotov\\", became available for playback on Echobelly's official Myspace page during January. In an interview with Phoenix FM in May 2013 the band stated that they were looking to record a new full-band under the Calm Of Zero name. On 21 July 2014, British independent record label 3 Loop Music released two CD expanded editions of Echobelly's Everyone's Got One and On albums. The re-releases included b-sides, live recordings, radio session tracks and unreleased material. A limited number of signed copies were also made available on the label's official online store. In October 2015, Echobelly made a successful return to stage, playing a sell-out gig at the 1,500 capacity Scala venue in London. On 31 May 2016, it was announced that Echobelly were entering the studio to record a new album entitled Anarchy and Alchemy. The album was released on 26 May 2017. In December 2018, a compilation album entitled ‚Äò‚ÄôBlack heart Lullabies‚Äô‚Äô was released.

These substances generally possess weak bonds--bonds that have small bond dissociation energies. Radical initiators are utilized in industrial processes such as polymer synthesis. Typical examples are halogen molecules, azo compounds, and organic and inorganic peroxides. Main types of initiation reaction *Halogens undergo homolytic fission relatively easily. Chlorine, for example, gives two chlorine radicals (Cl‚Ä¢) by irradiation with ultraviolet light. This process is used for chlorination of alkanes. *Azo compounds (R-N=N-R') can be the precursor of two carbon-centered radicals (R‚Ä¢ and R'‚Ä¢) and nitrogen gas upon heating and/or by irradiation. For example, AIBN and ABCN yield isobutyronitrile and cyclohexanecarbonitrile radicals, respectively. :AIBN initiator *Organic peroxides each have a peroxide bond (-O-O-), which is readily cleaved to give two oxygen-centered radicals. The oxyl radicals are unstable and believed to be transformed into relatively stable carbon-centered radicals. For example, di-tert-butyl peroxide (t-BuOOt-Bu) gives two t-butoxy radicals (t-BuO‚Ä¢) and the radicals become methyl radicals (CH3‚Ä¢) with the loss of acetone. Benzoyl peroxide ((PhC)OO)2) generates benzoyloxyl radicals (PhCOO‚Ä¢), each of which loses carbon dioxide to be converted into a phenyl radical (Ph‚Ä¢). Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is also common, and acetone peroxide is on rare occasions used as a radical initiator, too. *Inorganic peroxides function analogously to organic peroxides. Many polymers are often produced from the alkenes upon initiation with peroxydisulfate salts. In solution, peroxydisulfate dissociates to give sulfate radicals: :[O3SO-OSO3]2‚àí 2 [SO4]‚àí The sulfate radical adds to an alkene forming radical sulfate esters, e.g. .CHPhCH2OSO3‚àí, that add further alkenes via formation of C-C bonds. Many styrene and fluoroalkene polymers are produced in this way. * In atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) carbon-halides reversibly generate organic radicals in the presence of transition metal catalyst.

Plot  = Opening sequence = Kang and Kodos star in a fictional sitcom, entitled Keepin' it Kodos. In it, Kodos is preparing their boss' visit by cooking dinner: Homer on a baking tray (continually eating himself), Bart on a skillet, Marge and Maggie in pies and Lisa in a soup. The boss gives the meal a delicious rating, but his stomach bursts ends up liberating Bart. Kang and Kodos are given a hyper-galactic promotion, much to the aliens' delight. Bart is sad about the loss of his parents and sisters, but Kang and Kodos decide to adopt him, which comforts Bart. The theme song from Perfect Strangers plays as the Treehouse of Horror logo appears on the screen; an alien tentacle stamps the \\"XV\\" underneath which makes it say, \\"Treehouse of Horror XV\\" in the fashion of the Mark VII Limited company logo. = The Ned Zone = In a parody of The Dead Zone, Homer tries to get his frisbee from the roof by throwing a bowling ball after it. The ball strikes a passing Ned Flanders on the head. When Ned recovers in Dr. Hibbert's hospital, he has a vision of Hibbert falling out of a window to his death. Homer then asks Hibbert to retrieve his frisbee from a ledge on the hospital. As Hibbert reaches for the ledge, he slips out of the window, causing Ned's vision to come true. Ned realizes that he can see the deaths of people whom he touches. After he gets out of the hospital, he attempts to save Hans Moleman from falling down but has a vision of him being eaten by alligators. In shock, he drops Moleman into an open manhole with dozens of alligators swimming in it. He also predicts the closing of the Rosie O'Donnell musical, which he already suspected. A later vision depicts him shooting Homer, which horrifies Ned and he tries to conceal this from Homer. When Homer finds out, he taunts Ned and even gives him Chief Wiggum's gun to shoot him with, and says he could not even shoot him by accident. Ned refrains from shooting Homer, seemingly changing the future, but then has another vision of Homer blowing up Springfield by pressing the \\"Core Destruct\\" button at the nuclear power plant. Ned tries to dissuade Homer from going to work, but Homer goes anyway because of ice cream cake for Lenny's birthday. Ned rushes to the power plant to stop Homer, and Marge follows him to force her husband to clean the garage. Unfortunately, Ned's warning is scrambled by static over the intercom, sounding as if he is encouraging Homer to press the button. In desperation, Ned grabs a nearby security guard's gun to shoot Homer, fulfilling the original prediction, but in his death throes, Homer presses the destruct button with his tongue, much to Ned's fury before the power plant explodes and Springfield is destroyed. Ned, the Simpsons, and their still uncleaned garage go to Heaven as angels and meet God (again), who proceeds to give Homer \\"what he deserves\\" ‚Äì his frisbee. = Four Beheadings and a Funeral = In a parody of From Hell, taking place in 1890, London's prostitutes are being killed with swords in a series of unsolved murders by \\"Jack the Ripper\\" (referred as The Muttonchop Murderer). Scotland Yard's Inspector Wiggum challenges master detective Eliza Simpson and her easily amazed, goofy assistant Dr. Bartley to solve the crime. Their first piece of evidence is a bloody sword found by a \\"proper-Cockney flower girl\\", Marge. Simpson takes the sword to an oddities merchant (Comic Book Guy), who recognizes the sword as part of a set he had sold, called The Seven Swords of Osiris. He goes to check his dusty record books to see who he sold the swords to, but is killed by Jack the Ripper. Looking at the ledger, Simpson and Bartley discover the swords were sold to C. Ebenezer Burns, an industrialist who \\"makes coal out of babies\\". Bartley knows where to find Burns and tracks him down at Mao's (Moe's) Den of Inequity, an opium den. Burns instantly recognizes the sword, and tells Simpson that he sold them for opium to a \\"fat man with sideburns\\", and notices a man nearby who resembles the description, Homer. Simpson and Bartley chase him down and Homer gets caught by Wiggum, who happens to be at the opium den as well, to help his son Ralph go to sleep. Simpson and Bartley congratulate themselves for solving the crime, until they find another body, Selma, stabbed by another Sword of Osiris. Bartley first dismisses the body as having been killed days prior, pointing out the body as bloated and the face rotten, though Selma is alive long enough to say it was just \\"5 minutes ago\\". Simpson takes the sword and recognizes a certain scent on the sword handle. The next day, just before Homer is hanged for the murders, Simpson arrives, declaring Homer innocent due to the smell of eel pie on the handle, which Wiggum loves to eat. Officer Lou then reveals that Wiggum has muttonchops as well, exposing him as Jack the Ripper. He starts to explain that he just wanted to come up with a case that Simpson herself could not solve, but then flees in a hot-air balloon stolen from Professor Frink, but it gets pierced by a steampunk-style flying saucer flown by Kang and Kodos, who consider Earth's air fleet as destroyed. It is then shown that the whole story was an opium-caused dream by Ralph, which Wiggum reveals is part of an even crazier and fantastical dream that both of them are in. = In the Belly of the Boss = In a parody of Fantastic Voyage, at the \\"Invention Expo\\", Professor Frink creates a machine that shrinks objects. Maggie crawls inside a giant pill, thinking that it is a ball pit, which is miniaturized and swallowed by Mr. Burns. When the rest of the family realizes what's happened, they agree to be shrunk within a craft and injected into Burns' body. Homer is the craft's captain, Lisa is in charge of science and research, Bart is in charge of security, and Marge is in charge of helping the deeps of the science. When Homer refuses to follow Frink's instructions, the ship gets stuck in Burns' heart. The crew manage to get the ship free from the outside and are able to reach the stomach by catching a ride on a nerve impulse, which Lisa calls \\"the body's information superhighway\\". They manage to save Maggie, but Homer is forced to leave the ship and save the rest on his own when their craft does not have enough power to save them all due to the addition of Maggie's extra weight. Homer becomes initially despondent at his family is forced to leave him behind, but finds consolation in finding a marshmallow in Burns' stomach. The submarine successfully escapes, but there is not enough time to save Homer, who instantly returns to his original size inside Burns' skin, putting them both in extra pain. Even though Homer complains that Burns needs several extra holes, Burns is confident that things will work out. The episode ends with Burns and Homer leading a dance to the tune of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" (along with the characters from all three segments and the opening sequence).  Reception  The episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. Pip Ellwood Hughes was positive and said \\"In the Belly of the Boss\\" was the best segment of the three. Kevin Yeoman disliked the episode saying \\"much of it was old hat, and comfortably so. The best example of this is in the 'Treehouse of Horror XV' episode, which not only fails to elicit a single laugh, but also demonstrates how much the annual tradition had come to rely on spoofing pop-culture or horror films, rather than using the conventions of the genre to craft something funny and memorable. The execrable 'Four Beheadings and a Funeral' and 'In the Belly of the Boss' showing just how unfunny and lazily written these Halloween episodes can sometimes be.\\" Chris Morgan of Cinema Sentries thought the quality of the episode was questionable. On John Hugar's top 25 Treehouse of Horror episodes he placed the episode at #21. He enjoyed \\"The Ned Zone\\" but thought \\"Four Beheadings and a Funeral\\" \\"bland\\" and \\"In the Belly of the Boss\\" done better before. When ranking the top 78 Treehouse of Horror segments Louis Peitzman was positive on the segments. He placed \\"The Ned Zone at #56 and said \\"it's fairly well done\\" but said \\"like so many early 2000s episodes, it goes too far.\\" \\"Four Beheading and a Funereal was put at #49 and said \\"The distinctive look of the segment is great, and the murders are gruesome, but the mystery-solving itself isn‚Äôt worth more than a shrug.\\" \\"In the Belly of the Boss\\" was placed highest at #44 and he thought it had its moments.

Walter Sr. (September 18, 1922 - January 6, 2000), of Tampa, Florida in the United States, was a home builder who started Jim Walter Homes and Walter Industries, now doing business as Walter Energy, Inc., a leading producer of metallurgical coal for the global steel industry, in 1946 with $1,000 he borrowed from his father. Walter eventually sold the company in 1986 for $2 billion to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). Walter was the son of Ebe and Mabel Walter. The book Building a Business: The Jim Walter Story tells his story. His wife, Monica Walter, died in 1982, leaving two sons, James W. Walter Jr. and Robert Walter. The western section of what was known as Columbus Drive was renamed Jim Walter Boulevard in 2003.Jim Walter Boulevard Press Release Tampa Airport Jim Walter Homes Jim Walter homes were \\"shell\\" homes, meaning the company would complete the outside so that the house was watertight, then allow the customer to finish the inside with their own labor. The company would also sell most of the inside materials, including sheetrock, insulation, doors and carpet to the customer and include them in the purchase. The result was very affordable mortgage payments, usually for 20 years. The only requirement from the company was that the customer had owned the land on which the house was constructed, meaning that in the case of foreclosure the company got not only a (potentially never-finished) house but a building lot as well. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, when mortgage rates went as high as 15%, Jim Walter offered 10% financing with no money down. In 1961 Walter bought Celotex using just stock in Jim Walter Homes. The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"Jonah has just swallowed the whale.\\" In 1968, Walter bought US Pipe and Foundry. Later, Walter acquired Fry Roofing, Georgia Marble, and various other building material companies. In 1988, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired Jim Walter Corp. (later Walter Industries) for $3.3 billion in early 1988 but faced issues with the buyout almost immediately. Most notably, a subsidiary of Jim Walter Corp (Celotex) faced a large asbestos lawsuit and incurred liabilities that the courts ruled would need to be satisfied by the parent company.Feder, Barnaby. Asbestos: The Saga Drags On. New York Times, April 2, 1989. In 1989, the holding company that KKR used for the Jim Walter buyout filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Chapter 11 For Kohlberg, Kravis Unit. Associated Press, December 28, 1989. Walter Industries, its parent, closed Jim Walter Homes in January 2009, just prior to the separation of its related financing business.

Its title track remains one of his most popular songs. A number of songs relate the actions of those involved in political struggles, or those affected by those struggles; such as \\"Viva la Quinte Brigada\\" which is concerned with the Irish contingent amongst the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War; or \\"El Salvador\\" dealing with the civil war in that country in the 1980s. Other songs deal with Irish history ‚Äì \\"The City of Chicago\\", about emigration to America during the Irish famines of the late 1840s; \\"Back Home in Derry\\" written by Bobby Sands about the transportation to Australia of convicts; and \\"Lisdoonvarna\\" celebrating a music festival that took place annually in that town until the early 1980s. Reception Since Ride On is widely accepted as a landmark Moore album, it has been available ever since its original release and is regarded as one of the best possible introductions to the artist.

Winmalee is located 80 kilometres west of Sydney, in the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. At the , Winmalee had a population of 6,593. Originally known as North Springwood, Winmalee was officially established in 1972. Springwood is historically significant as the first European settlement in the Blue Mountains. Winmalee is surrounded by Blue Mountains National Park. This National Park is on the World Heritage List and is known as the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Site. The Blue Mountains area is unofficially known as \\"The City Within a World Heritage National Park\\". Winmalee extends from Birdwood Avenue and Paulwood Avenue to Coramandel Avenue and east to a point part-way along Singles Ridge Road. History It is commonly believed that Winmalee is an Aboriginal word for north. But, as Aboriginal cultures did not use north, south, east or west, this is doubtful. It is more likely a corruption of the world Wimlah, the name of one of the Three Sisters, a rock formation 35 km to the west. The name was coined by 14-year-old, who won a competition to find a name for North Springwood when the Geographical Names Board wanted to remove the compass prefixes from the names of towns and suburbs of New South Wales. =Aboriginal heritage= The area now officially known as Winmalee was once inhabited by Aboriginal Australians known as the Dharug tribe. This was a nomadic tribe which inhabited much of the Lower Blue Mountains until European colonisation and settlement. The dialect spoken by the tribe is known as the Dharug language. Current figures place the date of this settlement as beginning up to 50,000 years ago. Except for a small number of descendants there are no members of the Dharug tribe now living in the area. The majority of this group were thought to have moved northward in the Blue Mountains and to have merged with the Gundungurra tribe. Others are thought to have been wiped out during European exploration and settlement. Archaeological evidence from the aboriginal inhabitants is common throughout Winmalee and includes several open sites and occupation shelters.http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani/themes/theme1.htm =European settlement= In 1970, the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales suggested that the area which had been unofficially known as 'North Springwood' be made an independent suburb of the Blue Mountains and renamed 'White Cross' because of the rapidly increasing population growth of Springwood. However residents of the area objected to the name 'White Cross'. In 1971, the Department of Education selected \\"Winmalee\\" as the name for a new school in the area. Though the residents of the area approved this as the name for the proposed school they rejected it as a name for the suburb. The name Winmalee was chosen by the Department of Education as the result of a competition that had been organised amongst the local people. Terry Macauley, who was to be one of the school's original primary students, suggested the name \\"Winmalee\\", a supposed Aboriginal word for North.Winmalee Public School Retrieved 5 February 2007 The word was in fact never used by the Dharug people in relation to the area, but is instead a reference to its previous unofficial name. Winmalee was finally officially established as an independent town on 28 April 1972 after the Minister for Lands, Tom Lewis MLA announced the suburb's independence from Springwood and approved the name Winmalee despite objections from residents. = October 2013 bushfires = The town, the nearby village of Yellow Rock and a small part of the adjacent town of Springwood were badly affected by a bushfire which started on 17 October 2013. 196 residential properties were destroyed, and 109 damaged. 40 homes were destroyed on Buena Vista Road in Winmalee alone.

The school and its grounds are some of the oldest forms of architecture in the area. The St Columbas property is one of the largest property holdings in the Blue Mountains and is rich in native flora and fauna. The whole of the St Columbas property is a Heritage property.

The company also previously owned the Kwik Save chain of discount food stores. The company was taken over by the Co-operative Group on 2 March 2009 in a ¬£1.57 billion deal, creating the UK's fifth-largest food retailer. The Somerfield name was replaced by the Co-operative brand in a rolling programme of store conversions ending in summer 2011.Co-op supermarket chain enjoys Somerfield boost BBC News Online. 11 December 2009  Gateway history A Gateway supermarket in Skegness, Lincolnshire in 1992. =The early years= The company has its origins in a Bristol-based grocer known as J.H. Mills which was founded in 1875 and which developed a self-service supermarket chain named Gateway Foodmarkets in 1960. During the early 1970s, Gateway operated primarily in the southwest of England with a few stores elsewhere. Ford and Lock stores and S&H; Pink Stamp acquisitions took place during the period when loyalty stamps were prevalent and the first freezer centres were opened. Gateway Foodmarkets was taken over by Linfood Holdings, a consortium which already owned the Frank Dee Supermarkets which operated over the north and east of England. At the time Frank Dee Supermarkets and the larger DEE Discount stores were a business larger than Gateway and had a chain of 79 supermarkets, in 1977. In 1983, Linfood Holdings was renamed the Dee Corporation. Initial plans were proposed to utilise the distribution depots on three main sites; the thriving Frank Dee's purpose built facilities in Anlaby and Billingham, and the existing Gateway warehousing site in Bristol. =Acquisitions= Alec Monk, chief executive of the Dee Corporation, having escaped a takeover bid from Argyll Foods in 1981, decided to create his own supermarket empire. Three of the biggest acquisitions were of Key Markets from Fitch Lovell, International Stores, bought from British American Tobacco in 1984, and Fine Fare, bought from Associated British Foods the following year. The company also purchased the UK arm of the French retailer, Carrefour when the French retailer exited Britain in the late 1980s. By this time, the Dee Corporation had over 1,100 stores and nearly 12% of the market, not far behind Sainsbury's and Tesco.Corporate Strategy in UK Food Retailing 1980-2002 by Geoffrey Owen, Page 9 Most of the Dee Corporation‚Äôs outlets were small, high-street stores. Monk argued that there was a future for well-run conventional supermarkets as well as the large out-of-town stores. However, by 1987 the Dee Corporation ran into problems, mainly because of the difficulty of integrating so many disparate businesses. Some disposals were made in that year, including the Linfood wholesaling operation. In 1988, the Dee Corporation changed its name to the Gateway Corporation, and a new retailing chief was recruited from the US. Investors remained sceptical, and in 1989 the Company was the subject of a ¬£2bn takeover bid from a newly formed company, Isosceles; the deal was partly financed by a pre-arranged sale of 61 Gateway stores to Asda. =Isosceles era= When Isosceles, a newly created financial group led by David Smith and backed by several big investment institutions, bid successfully for Gateway in 1989 and took the company private, the plan was to restructure the business and refocus it on what were called \\"middle ground\\" outlets, falling between the larger out of town superstores and smaller, inner-city neighbourhood shops; the average size of the stores was between and . The promoters of the Isosceles bid believed that, after this disposal and extensive restructuring of the rest of the portfolio, Gateway could become a viable competitor; the intention was to re-float the company on the stock market within three to five years. However, the bid was highly leveraged, and it was not clear that the new company would be able to fund the necessary modernisation of the business.Corporate Strategy in UK Food Retailing 1980-2002 by Geoffrey Owen Page 20 Some of the planned disposals of non-core businesses took longer than expected to complete. Financial strains led to the enforced departure of David Smith and other executives in 1991. Somerfield history Safeway) in Oakwood, Leeds In the following year, a new chief executive, Bob Willett, was appointed and a decision was taken to rebrand the company's operations as Somerfield after a successful pilot scheme in 1990 with a new store and the first Somerfield store in the country being built in Burnham on Sea, Somerset, and the company then built its success upon the new brand alongside the existing Gateway and Food Giant chains. A small number of stores were also relaunched under a new Food Giant discount brand, with the first store opening in Nottingham in 1991. Two years later, yet another chief executive, David Simons, was in command. In May 1994 the company changed its name to Somerfield plc. According to The Guardian newspaper, the holding company almost collapsed in the 1990s under a \\"mountain of debt\\". In 1996, Somerfield plc was floated on the stock market in an initial public offering, after the recovery had reached the point where flotation became feasible with a market value of around ¬£600m, and the proceeds were used to repay banks that had lent to Isosceles. At the time of the flotation the company‚Äôs market share had fallen to 5.3%, its lowest level for two years, but Simons claimed that the company was now clearly positioned in the market, and that the business would benefit from what he saw as the trend back towards high-street shopping. The aim was to become the UK‚Äôs strongest neighbourhood food retailer. Questions remained about whether, at a time of intense competition both from discounters and from the bigger chains, Somerfield could generate adequate growth in sales and profits. In 1997 the Somerfield website was launched, which gave customers access to viewing online content such as offers, services and recipes, as well as online shopping via the chain's free Home Delivery service. =Slogans= \\"Shopping in the real world\\" (until 2002) \\"Somerthing Different\\" (2002-2005) \\"Great deals on your doorstep\\" (2005-2006) \\"Giving you what you want\\" (2006-2008) \\"Pop in to Somerfield\\" (2008-2011) =Kwik Save purchase= In 1998, the company took over the rival Kwik Save in a ¬£473 million transaction. Although the deal was billed as a merger of equals, Somerfield investors owned 62.5% of the enlarged group. Observers questioned whether putting together two very different businesses would solve either‚Äôs problems. The initial plan was to convert most of the Kwik Save stores to the Somerfield fascia, but the group continued to suffer from a disparate store portfolio, the result of numerous ill digested acquisitions by Kwik Save prior to the Somerfield takeover.Corporate Strategy in UK Food Retailing 1980-2002 by Geoffrey Owen, p.21 At the end of 1999 Simons, facing strong criticism from the City, announced plans to sell a third of the company‚Äôs 1,400 stores. He admitted that the group had underestimated the difference between Somerfield and Kwik Save, and had failed to support and maintain the Kwik Save brand, and a few months later Simons resigned. The original plan to transfer all Kwik Save stores to the Somerfield fascia was quickly abandoned after it became clear that many outlets were not suitable for conversion, either due to size or location. Also, the downmarket wooden shelving and poor quality fittings used by Kwik Save meant that every conversion required a full refurbishment of the store - simply changing the signage and uniforms would have risked dragging the carefully developed Somerfield brand downmarket. Instead, the larger Kwik Save stores were converted, some were sold or closed and the chain became a trading division of Somerfield Stores Ltd, sharing its supply chain and back office systems with Somerfield. For some years, the own brand products in Kwik Save stores were Somerfield, although this policy was reversed once it was decided to keep the brand. It was clear that more than a hundred Somerfield and Kwik Save stores were within a mile of each other and directly competing: also customers were switching from high street to out of town shopping. =Somerfield Direct= Somerfield launched a home shopping pilot in the Bristol area under the name Somerfield Direct in early 1999. As a call centre operated service, customers would telephone the company to order Somerfield produce, which would be delivered direct from the warehouse. After the launch, Somerfield bought Supermarket Direct in April 1999 for ¬£3.25 million to extend the range of Somerfield Direct, and Supermarket Direct partners Dominick Scott-Flanagan and David Noble joined the Somerfield Direct board. At the time Somerfield Direct only covered the South West of England from its base in Bristol. With the incorporation of Supermarket Direct, Somerfield Direct extended its range to the London area. While other home shopping services were providing internet ordering, at this point Somerfield Direct was a catalogue and call-centre operation, chief executive Simons expressing the view that \\"Mrs Smith in Stockport is more likely to use a handy catalogue from her supermarket than surf the Net in search for Fido's dog food\\". The operation launched internet ordering in July 1999, and was then rebranded as \\"Somerfield 24-7\\". At its peak the home shopping division employed 225 staff and operated from three distribution centres. However, Somerfield suffered large losses in 2000, its home shopping venture was described as an \\"ill-fated foray\\", and development was halted that June. =John von Spreckelsen= John von Spreckelsen, former chief executive of convenience food retailer Budgens, was brought in as chairman in April 2000. The new strategy was to keep Somerfield and Kwik Save as separate businesses, while sharing common services in such areas as information technology and corporate finance. By mid-2002 ‚Äì half way through what was seen as a five-year recovery programme ‚Äì the company announced a return to the black, and dividends were resumed after a two-year break, although the positioning issues remained unsolved. Somerfield was the product of opportunistic acquisitions, driven more by financial engineering than by any conception of where the company should be positioned. The focus on medium- sized high street supermarkets was largely a matter of making the best of a very difficult job; the main problem, which had not been solved by the end of the 1980s, was to make some sense of the heterogeneous collection of stores which it had acquired through its numerous takeovers. =New formats= A Somerfield in East Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Somerfield changed its logo in 2002 from a rectangular shape to a more contemporary design and opened a number of store formats, including Somerfield Essentials and Somerfield Market Fresh. It further changed its brand image by introducing newer own-brand lines including the premium 'So Good' range, the low fat 'Good Intentions', and a new advertising strapline: \\"Somerthing Different\\". A low-price own brand label called 'Makes Sense' was introduced to compete with rival low-cost brands, such as Tesco Value. For some time a few years later, some larger stores received a section for a range of products labelled under the German-based Tchibo brand, however these were later removed by 2009. =Safeway Compact= In October 2004, Somerfield acquired 114 Safeway Compact stores from Morrisons, which were subsequently re branded under the Somerfield name. This deal was referred to the Competition Commission. After completing its investigation, the commission instructed Somerfield to sell 12 stores. In September 2005, Somerfield announced its intention to appeal against the decision, a process delayed by a takeover bid for the chain. The Competition Appeal Tribunal upheld the commission's decision in February 2006. Somerfield therefore had to proceed with sale of the 12 stores. However, the sale of Kwik Save in February 2006 is likely to have removed the potential clashes between some of the offending stores. = Acquired by private equity = Retail entrepreneurs John Lovering and Bob Mackenzie made two failed bids to take over the Company in 2003. Then in 2005, Icelandic venture capital group Baugur made an approach, while United Co-operatives and London & Regional Properties also expressed an interest, but both groups dropped out of the running. Then on 21 December 2005 Somerfield plc was acquired for ¬£1.1 billion by a consortium consisting of Apax Partners, Barclays Capital and the Tchenguiz Family Trust, at which time the name of the group changed to Somerfield Ltd. The aim of the new owners was to simplify the business and attract new customers. The first move was the end of the SaverCard loyalty scheme in May 2006 with promotional deals becoming available to all customers. A new point of sale was introduced to make promotions and price cuts more visible to customers. Somerfield's three own-label brands have also been overhauled; the budget 'Makes Sense' range became 'Simply Value', the low calories 'Good Intentions' range became 'Healthy Choice', and the premium 'So Good' range became 'Best Ever!'. =Kwik Save sale= In 2005, Somerfield closed 22 of its 51 Scottish Kwik Save stores and re-branded the remainder under its own name, thus removing the Kwik Save brand from the marketplace north of the border. After the group was taken over, it was reported that the new owners found the Kwik Save chain was losing ¬£40m per year, effectively cancelling out around 40% of the profits generated by the Somerfield division. As a result, it sped up the conversion of stores from Kwik Save to Somerfield. On 27 February 2006, Somerfield Stores Ltd sold the Kwik Save brand and 171 stores to BTTF, an investment vehicle headed by Paul Niklas, for an undisclosed sum. Somerfield re-branded the 102 Kwik Save sites it had retained under its own name and a further 77 stores were sold to other retailers, thought to include Netto and Aldi, leaving the company to focus solely on the Somerfield brand. Subsequent to the initial sale, a further 19 Kwik Save stores were acquired by BTTF, including some of those included in the Competition Commission investigation ruling into the Safeway Compact takeover. =Store rationalisation= In August 2006, a series of store closures was announced as Somerfield's new owners continued their restructuring activity. Some of these were poorly performing Somerfield stores and some were former Kwik Save sites that had not proved successful after being converted to Somerfield stores in 2006. Some stores were sold to other groups, including Sainsbury's, which bought five stores, while others were closed completely. In October 2006, it was revealed that 40 Somerfield stores, including many retained Kwik Save branches, had been sold. These stores were mainly under-performing converted Kwik Save stores.The Appointment magazine is now online In November 2006, the company also sold a further 12 stores to Marks & Spencer to trade under the M&S; Simply Food brand. This deal included stores in Blackheath in south east London, Broughty Ferry in Dundee, and Petersfield and Alton in Hampshire. Having bought 140 Texaco petrol stations in 2007, Somerfield tripled the size of some of their shops, using a similar format to its convenience stores. Signage was replaced with the Somerfield brand. =Takeover by the Co- operative Group= On 16 July 2008, it was announced that Somerfield would be acquired by the Co-operative Group for ¬£1.57 billion, subject to approval from the Office of Fair Trading. The build-up to this announcement began in late 2007, when the parent private equity consortium, that had acquired Somerfield in December 2005, put the chain up for sale. News reports valued the chain at over ¬£1.5 billion. Somerfield appointed Citigroup to manage the sale, and a preference to sell as a going concern rather than on a piecemeal basis was reported. It emerged that four provisional bids were made. Only the Co- operative Group, the UK's largest co-operative, publicly announced purchase talks, aiming to complete due diligence for the entire estate of 900 Somerfield stores in the third quarter, but would be expected to sell a minority of stores. On 24 June, a Thomson Reuters newswire reported sources indicating that the Co-operative Group's acquisition of Somerfield could be finalised at the start of July, in a final deal worth ¬£1.7 billion. Earlier in June, Morrisons confirmed that it was not bidding for Somerfield, but would consider the purchase of any stores that are sold after the acquisition. Newspaper sources said that other major supermarket chains are also interested in such purchases. In July 2008, the Co-operative Group announced a deal to purchase Somerfield for ¬£1.57 billion, creating the fifth largest supermarket chain in the UK. It was confirmed on 20 October 2008 that the Office of Fair Trading had approved the sale of Somerfield under the condition that 133 stores must be sold. This process continued into 2009 with many stores changing ownership, for example to Lidl. In February 2009, it was announced that The Co-operative Group planned to close the Somerfield head office in Bristol and relocate all operations to its existing head office in Manchester. The Co-operative said that it would try to relocate as many staff as possible to other areas of the business or to its head office in Manchester, to try to avoid redundancies. The takeover was officially completed on 2 March 2009. Operations As an independent entity, Somerfield was the sixth largest food retailer in the UK, according to TNS Worldpanel, following the sale of the Kwik Save unit and the closure or sale of unprofitable stores, with 977 stores (as of January 2007). Also the fifth largest private company in the UK, Somerfield had a 3.8% share of the UK grocery market in 2007, down from 4.5% in 2006. The five larger retailers (in descending order of size) were Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and The Co-operative Group. The top four have specialities in larger superstores, while the Co-op has become the largest community retailer, with specialities in convenience stores and smaller supermarkets. At one point in early 2007, Somerfield was also briefly surpassed in size by Waitrose, and the independent grocers' distributor, Nisa, is comparable in size. Graph Showing Market Share of Somerfield, including that of Kwik-Save References in popular culture The branch of Somerfield in Wells, Somerset, England had featured prominently in the 2007 film Hot Fuzz and Somerfield branding was clearly visible. In the film, the manager of the supermarket Simon Skinner, played by Timothy Dalton; is a charming but sinister individual. The film includes a gun battle scene in the supermarket between police and staff members in full Somerfield uniforms, and a scene involving hand-to-hand combat. Simon Skinner was also injured after tripping on a miniature Somerfield lorry in a model village, landing on the model church and getting severely injured in the throat. The Somerfield shop also appeared on BBC's Top Gear, during an interview between actor Simon Pegg and host Jeremy Clarkson. The reason the store was chosen was due to the director of the film Edgar Wright having formerly worked at the store. Wright also made an amateur film called Dead Right that had scenes in the same store which is featured on the bonus DVD editions of Hot Fuzz. The gameshow Supermarket Sweep for its 1993‚Äì2001 run on ITV had the supermarket set modelled and furnished after ASDA, between 1993‚Äì94, complete with their own brand products, then Somerfield of the era between 1995‚Äì97, and then the Co-op until the original series ended in 2001. The 2007 revival series had a similar look. The store under its Gateway name, featured briefly in the 1990 Christmas Special of Only Fools and Horses (\\"Rodney Come Home\\"), in which a store can be seen behind the main characters Del Boy and Uncle Albert, while they are travelling up an escalator to reach the top floor of a shopping precinct, so Del Boy can sell a set of dolls that wet themselves and sing a lullaby in Chinese, while Albert acts as his \\"Lookout\\" (for police officers).

In honour of his service to the city the Dr. Martin L. Dobkin Community Park, a large 30 acre park in central Mississauga with multiple facilities, was officially opened on June 14, 1992. Background Dobkin was born in Toronto, Ontario on May 8, 1942 to Irving and Mary (n√©e Gorlitsky) Dobkin, immigrants from Russia. In 1955, at the age of 13 years, he moved to Cobourg, Ontario with his family. He attended Cobourg and District Collegiate Institute. He graduated from Queen's University Medical School in 1966. This was followed by an internship at Montreal General Hospital and then a one-year residency in pediatrics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. In 1968 he married Michele Bitton and they had 3 children - Edward, Caroline and Alain. Also in 1968 he began his medical practice as a family physician in Mississauga. and became a member of the active staff at the Mississauga Hospital. In 1970 Dobkin was appointed as coroner in the County of Peel. Medical career In 1968, Dobkin began practising family medicine in Cooksville in the practice of Drs. Ann and J. D. Smith. In 1970, he left this practice and opened up his own office in Applewood Hills. In 1978, he purchased a property at the corner of Hwy. #10 and Central Parkway West and, in conjunction with Dr. K. Malicki, founded the City Centre Family Physician Clinic. The clinic soon grew to seven family physicians, the largest family practice clinic in South Mississauga. In 1992, a new comprehensive medical building was constructed on the site and the practice continued there. Dobkin worked in the Emergency Department of the Mississauga Hospital on a part-time basis for 20 years. For the first 17 years in practice, he delivered several hundred newborns. He held the position of medical director at the Tyndall Nursing Home from 1976-1984. He served on various committees at the Mississauga Hospital and has been a member of the Department of Family Practice since 1968. Politics On October 1, 1973, as a political novice, he was elected as the first mayor of the newly created City of Mississauga. At 31 years of age, Dobkin became the youngest person in Canada to be elected mayor of a large city. He served a three-year term as mayor and councillor on the Region of Peel Council. Dobkin was swept into office as the head of a \\"reform council\\" in Mississauga, which included other newcomers such as Mary- Helen Spence, David Culham, Hubert Wolf, Kaye Killaby, and Hazel McCallion. The term of the first council was very prolific, creative, and productive in its many achievements. The most important of these was the initiation and creation of a new and comprehensive official plan for the new city, which provided the blueprint for the future large-scale development of the city into one of the finest municipalities in Canada. Numerous properties were purchased to provide the green space and parklands for the new city. These included the acquisitions of the Rattray Marsh, Adamson House, Cawthra Elliott Estate, Jack Darling Park, Morning Dew Park, Cooksville Creek Lands, and the CVCA parkland at the mouth of the Credit River. Libraries that were built or completed were the Burnhamthorpe, Lorne Park, and the Lakeview branches. As well, the Malton Community Centre and the Mississauga Valley Community Centre were designed and built. During Dobkin's era, Mississauga Transit was significantly enlarged, adding a state-of-the-art transit headquarters on Central Parkway West, Canada's first articulated buses, and many other infrastructure projects. In the 1976 municipal election, Dobkin faced city councillor Ron Searle. Dobkin who was portrayed as the anti-development candidate, was defeated by Searle by about 3,000 votes.

He studied from 1795-1796 in the medical school of St. Petersburg. In the years 1800-1802 he traveled across Transcaucasia in the entourage of Count Apollo Mussin-Pushkin (1760-1805). In 1805, he was part of a scientific team attached to the unsuccessful diplomatic mission of Count Yury Golovkin to China. After the failure of the mission, he and many of the other scientists stayed on in Siberia to pursue their researches. In 1806, while in Yakutsk, he heard about an intact woolly mammoth carcass near the mouth of the Lena River. He hastily arranged an expedition to the location where he was able to recover most of the skeleton, skin, and almost forty pounds of hair. At the time, and for almost a century after, this was the most complete mammoth known. He returned to St. Petersburg with his prize. The skeleton is now on display at The Museum of Zoology in Saint Petersburg, where it is known as the Adams mammoth. Later in his life, he taught as assistant professor for botanics at the Medico- Surgical Academy of Moscow.

Early life Searle was born in Southampton, England to Ruby and Theodore Searle on July 19, 1919. His mother was a seamstress and his father was a purser with the White Star Line and a seaman with the Royal Navy during World War I. The family relocate to Toronto where the family had relatives. =Military career= After joining the Toronto Scottish militia in the mid-1930s, Searle later signed up with the Toronto Scottish Regiment immediately upon Canada declaring war against Nazi Germany in September 1939. During World War II Searle landed twice in France, once at Brest and once at Normandy. He was later wounded at Falaise in Ardennes when he took three machine gun bullets to his leg. =Post-war life and family= After the war he began a career in magazine publishing. On December 10, 1949 he married his wife, Mollie, and together they raised one son, Mark William Searle. The Searles were married for 50 years until Mollie Searle's death in 1999. Political career Searle first entered politics when he was elected president of the Orchard Heights Homeowners Association in 1959. In 1962, he was elected to Mississauga town council and served for fourteen years. While on council Searle fiercely debated with sitting mayor Martin Dobkin in both municipal and regional council meetings on many issues, including increased municipal funding for child care and legal aid. Dobkin, who referred to Searle as \\"the official leader of the opposition\\", noted that despite the political opposition the two enjoyed a friendly personal relationship. Searle was elected mayor in 1976 amid a corruption scandal in the municipal government and a massive real estate boom throughout the city. With increased home prices driving lower-income citizens out of Mississauga, Searle made affordable housing a central issue of his administration and told a reporter for the Toronto Star shortly after his electoral victory that \\"[his] concern for [affordable housing] overrides all other concerns.\\" Throughout his term in office he lobbied for cheaper homes and opposed the federal government's cuts to housing grants. Searle ran for re-election at the end of his term in 1978, but lost to former Streetsville mayor Hazel McCallion with a final tally of 28,005 to 25,029 votes. He later made another unsuccessful bid for the mayoralty in 1982, but was defeated by McCallion again. While still a councillor, Searle also ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate for the riding of Peel in the 1965 federal election. He finished a distant second to Liberal candidate Bruce Beer. Later life and death Following his failed 1982 election bid, Searle remained active in the community. He would often represent homeowners' interests at city hall, and was a frequent participant in veterans' events and events at the Port Credit Yacht Club. In 2007 he was highly critical of Tim Peterson's installation as the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario candidate for Mississauga South after crossing the floor from the Ontario Liberal Party, remarking that the process was \\"a violation of the democratic principles the [Progressive] Conservative Party has stood for over the years\\". In late August 2015, Searle was admitted to Mississauga Hospital for pneumonia. He died in hospital on August 29, 2015 at the age of 96. The City of Mississauga set up an official book of condolences at the Mississauga Civic Centre and lowered the flags at all city-owned buildings in his honour from August 29 to September 11, 2015.

It was built in 1840‚Äì1841 to replace Toronto's original Fort York at the mouth of Garrison Creek as the primary military base for the settlement. Unlike the older fort, many of the new fort buildings were made with limestone, instead of wood. A protective wall was planned for the new fort but was never built. The fort was used by the British army until 1870, and the Canadian military subsequently used the fort to train troops for the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. It also trained one of the first regiments of the North-West Mounted Police. The Canadian military stopped using it after World War II and the fort was demolished in the 1950s. Only the Officers' Quarters building remains on the site. History =British era= The Royal Canadian Dragoons was one of several Canadian militia regiments stationed at the Fort. When the British set up the military defences of York, Upper Canada, a military reservation was created by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe, roughly bordered by today's Dufferin Street, Queen Street, Peter Street and the lakeshore. Two 18-pounder guns were placed on the lakeshore just to the east of the future fort site, known as the Western Battery, to protect the approach to the harbour. Guns were also placed on the western shoreline of the Toronto Islands. The Western Battery guns were destroyed in the War of 1812's Battle of York in 1813. As the old Fort York's wood buildings aged, it was determined that new accommodations were needed. In addition, private buildings were being rented in the town to accommodate soldiers. To finance the new fort, Lieutenant Governor Colborne approved the sale of some of the military reserve lands in 1833. It was not until after the 1837 rebellion that action was taken to start construction. Approval was given in 1839 by Lieutenant-Governor Bond Head to build a new fort to accommodate 300 soldiers, based on an 1833 plan drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel Gustavus Nicolls. A series of six stone buildings were constructed around 1840 by the Royal Engineers of the British Army with the biggest building being the Officers' Quarters. The two-storey Queenston limestone structure cost 19,000 pounds sterling. The fort also included two privates' barracks (holding 207 and 105 soldiers), a hospital, an officers' stable, barracks master's store, an engine house, gunpowder magazine and a canteen, all organized around a parade square. The original plan included fortifications surrounding the fort but as a cost-saving measure a cedar picket fence to enclose the fort was constructed, with fortifications to be added at some later time. A road was built between the forts, entering the new fort through a wrought-iron gate and passing under an arch in the eastern privates' barracks. General Plan of Stanley Barracks Although living conditions were considered good for the time, conditions during the winter were considered very cold, and keeping water from freezing was difficult. During the 1850s, the number of British troops at the fort was reduced, having been deployed in the Crimean War. Numbers rose again in the 1860s during the United States Civil War. In the 1860s, the space at the new fort was insufficient and The 13th Hussars were quartered in the nearby Crystal Palace exhibition building. =Transfer to Canada= In 1867, three of the British colonies, including the Province of Canada, united to form the new country of Canada. In 1870, the British Army withdrew from the Fort, with the property turned over to the Canadian Militia, the official turnover happening in 1871. The fort became mostly vacant, used only by a few military families for living quarters and the Ontario Rifle Association for training and exhibitions. In 1874, the new North-West Mounted Police used the fort to train a group of recruits for deployment in Manitoba. In 1883, the Government of Canada established the first permanent force of the military and a new military purpose for the fort was established. After some repairs, the fort reopened in 1884 as an infantry school and base for the Regiment of Canadian Artillery, Company C, later named The Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR). The Company would see its first action the following year in the North-West Rebellion. The rifle ranges of the fort led to incidents with passing boats and pedestrians. Bullets would occasionally hit boats if they strayed too close and two persons were struck by bullets in 1887. The Canadian military purchased land for a new rifle range in 1889 just west of Etobicoke Creek in Toronto Township, just west of Long Branch. In 1893, The Royal Canadian Dragoons were transferred to the fort. That same year the fort was renamed Stanley Barracks after Lord Stanley of Preston, the retired Governor-General of Canada. Lord Stanley is also famous for donating hockey's Stanley Cup. In 1894, the Dragoons performed their first Dragoon Musical Ride described as \\"drill pattern formation riding to music at three and a half paces.\\" The Musical Ride would be performed for many years by the Dragoons until they became an armoured regiment in 1940. It was a popular feature of the CNE Grandstand show. Later in the 1890s, troops of the Dragoons and the RCR from the fort helped to police the Yukon Gold Rush. Troops of the Dragoons and RCR also joined British forces fighting in South Africa in the Second Boer War. The better pay offered to soldiers to fight in South Africa also led to desertions. In 1901, 46 men of the Dragoons and RCR deserted. =Transfer to City of Toronto= In 1878, the Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West was held on the reserve. The next year, the annual Toronto Industrial Exhibition, later to become the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), was held on the site under a lease by the City of Toronto. As the CNE grew in size every year, the City of Toronto sought to take more and more of the Military Reserve. The end of the New Fort and the Military Reserve began in 1903 when the Government of Canada and the City of Toronto entered into an agreement to transfer the lands of the Old Fort, the New Fort and Fort's graveyard to City of Toronto ownership. The City promised to preserve the Old Fort and the graveyard and to allow all military activities on the property to continue until replacement facilities were built. German prisoners of war held in Stanley Barracks during World War I. During World War I, fort activities expanded to the CNE buildings, which were used for winter quarters, (summer quarters were at Long Branch) although the CNE continued. The barracks were used as a receiving station for the internment of German, Austro-Hungarian, and Turkish citizens, considered \\"enemy aliens\\". From 1914 until October 1916, up to 90 men at one time were interned in the west privates' barracks before being transferred to other facilities. Before the war was over, many were pardoned and released upon the signing of pledges of loyalty to the laws of Canada and to report regularly to police stations. Ukrainians, then subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were held in the barracks. In 1998, the Ukrainian community of Toronto erected a plaque at the Officers' Quarters to memorialize the internment. In the 1920s, the continued expansion of the CNE meant further encroachment on the Fort grounds. The CNE asked the City of Toronto to give notice for the military to vacate. The new Princes' Boulevard necessitated the demolition of some of the Barracks' buildings, including some stables and the riding school. Room for horses was offered in the buildings used for livestock. A compromise was made and new stables were built and the military offered the use of the Coliseum and Livestock arenas. View of fort and Ex buildings in 1931 During World War II, the fort and many of the nearby exhibition buildings were again used by Canadian troops prior to being sent overseas. The Coliseum was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Artillery used the Dominion Government Building, while the Horse Palace housed the 48th Highlanders, Toronto Scottish, Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps and the B Company of the Royal Canadian Regiment. Other buildings used included the General Exhibits Building, the Graphic Arts Building and the Horticultural Building. The dressing room of the Grandstand was used for anti- gas instruction. The annual CNE went on as scheduled with emphasis on the war effort in Canada as well as Britain, in 1939, 1940 and 1941. Several of the buildings used by the military were open to the public during the Ex. The CNE was not held during 1942‚Äì1945. The CNE Camp was used as a demobilization centre for returning troops at the end of the war before closing on June 1, 1946. After World War II, the military withdrew from Stanley Barracks to the military installation at Long Branch. The Royal Canadian Dragoons had already relocated in 1941 to Camp Borden. The CNE announced a plan to demolish the fort and build a new civic auditorium. However, these plans went on hold, as Toronto was experiencing a housing shortage emergency. The Government of Canada contributed 50% of the cost to convert the buildings (there were 31 at the time) for emergency civilian housing. The military retained its detention facility temporarily. Considered to be in extremely poor condition, the housing began closing down in 1950 and was evacuated by 1951. Demolition of the wooden buildings began in 1951 while families were still living in the barracks. By September 1951, only the four stone buildings remained: the officers' quarters, the hospital building and the two soldiers' barracks. Community support developed to preserve the Barracks to operate as a museum. Governor-General Vincent Massey advocated to retain the stone buildings. Three of the last four buildings were demolished in 1953 to provide parking for the CNE. The final building remained in limbo. The CNE Association planned to demolish the building for more parking. In 1957, it was saved from demolition by Toronto City Council on the advice of the Toronto Civic Historical Committee. The gates to the barracks (gate doors forged in England in 1839) were salvaged in 1957 by the owners of the Guild Inn in Scarborough. The gates were re-erected in Toronto on Kingston Road at Guildwood Parkway, at the entrance to Guildwood Village, where they may still be viewed. Lights replaced the stone globes on the top of the gate posts. The Archaeological and Historic Sites Board of Ontario erected a plaque commemorating the fort on November 11, 1963, near the former Officers' Quarters. The ceremony was attended by the 29th Field Regiment, the 42nd Medium Regiment and the 1st Artillery Locating Regiment of the Royal Canadian Artillery, and the Toronto Garrison Artillery Band. Dignitaries included Lt-General G. G. Simmonds, former chief of the General Canadian Staff, Professor J. M. Careless of the Ontario Historical Sites Board, Col. R. S. Timmons, former commander of The Royal Canadian Dragoons and Maj. W. J. Lennox the artillery chaplain. Timmons, commander of the garrison for 5 1/2 years, unveiled the plaque. In 2004, plans were developed to build a hotel and conference centre on the fort site, north of the Quarters. A letter of intent was signed by the owner of the Windsor Arms Hotel. A required archaeological dig found the foundations of the stone buildings. The City of Toronto decided not to build on the fort site. Instead, the Automotive Building to the east was converted to a conference centre, the hotel was moved to the east of the fort site and the foundations were to be preserved. The new Hotel X Toronto project adjacent to the site has revealed the barracks' foundations. An entrance pavilion to the hotel is a steel lattice structure that approximates the shape of the enlisted men's barracks. Within, the uncovered foundations are visible through a glass floor. The parade ground has become a landscaped plaza. Regiments from the British Army and the Canadian militia that were garrisoned at the fort include: * Royal Canadian Rifles * Seventy-First Highland Light Infantry * Royal Artillery * Thirteenth Hussars * Canadian Permanent Force * C Company of the School of Infantry, now The Royal Canadian Regiment * B Squadron, The Royal Canadian Dragoons Officers' Quarters The Officers' Quarters is the only surviving building of New Fort York. The two-storey Officers' Quarters is designed in the Georgian style with influences of English Palladianism. It rises two storeys, with full basement and attic, on a foundation of Kingston limestone, its thick walls built with Queenston limestone with a surrounding dry moat. Its original roof was covered with slate tiles but was recovered with metal. Its north face was designed to be the front, facing the parade ground. The south face is identical to the north face. The building was organized to give two-thirds to the officers and one-third to the Barracks' Master. Since 1955, the Officers' Quarters building has served as the home for various museums, including Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Marine Museum. From 1955 to 1957, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and in 1957, the Hockey Hall of Fame shared space at the Quarters. The Officers' Quarters housed the Marine Museum from 1959 to 1998 until it moved to Harbourfront. The museum has since closed. Vacant since 1998, the Officers' Quarters was opened for one weekend in May 2006 during Doors Open Toronto. While the building was home to the Marine Museum, the grounds housed two items from Toronto history. The tugboat Ned Hanlan was on display until 2012 on the west side of the building. Canadian National locomotive No. 6213 was located on the east side from 1960 until 2009. In 1999, Toronto City Council designated the Quarters as a Landmark Heritage Property under the Ontario Heritage Act. In 2009, City Council approved the development of a hotel on the property, just to the east of the fort's site. To the north of the Officers' Quarters, the former parking lot is now a plaza. To the south of the Officers' Quarters is a garden used for outdoor events. The former shoreline of Lake Ontario is outlined on the paving of a pathway along the Quarters. The exterior of the building is being restored, while the use for the building remains undetermined. According to author Richard Palmisano, the Officers' Quarters has two ghosts: a little girl hunting for her cat, and the girl's father. The building has been on a walking tour for ghosts on the Exhibition grounds.

It opened as a teacher training college in 1949 with awards from the University of Leeds. The college merged with the University of Leeds in 2001 and the campus closed in 2007. History In 1949 Bretton Hall College, a teacher training college founded by Alec Clegg specialising in innovative courses in design, music and the visual and performance arts, opened in the historic Bretton Hall in West Bretton, Yorkshire. It became an affiliated college of the University of Leeds, which validated its degrees. The college had financial difficulties, and, with the support of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), merged with the University of Leeds in August 2001. Most of the music, fine art and teacher training courses were moved to the Leeds campus, but visual and performing arts education and creative writing remained at the Bretton site, which became home to the University's School of Performance and Cultural Industries. In December 2004 the university's governing body reversed an earlier decision and decided that the Bretton Hall site was not financially viable, and the School of Performance and Cultural Industries should move to the main university campus in summer 2007, allowing all existing Bretton-based students to complete their studies there. The closure was documented on the BBC website by student Clair Parker.Parker,Clair.\\"Bye-bye Bretton Hall\\", bbc.co.uk, 2 November 2005. Retrieved on 25 February 2008. In June 2006 it was announced that Bretton Hall was to be sold to Wakefield Council. On 3 May 2007 John Godber presented Final Curtain, a documentary on Bretton Hall, broadcast on BBC Radio 4. On 5 and 6 May 2007, a reunion was organised for the alumni and students of Bretton Hall between 1947 and 2007 as a celebration of the school's contribution to the arts industry and also the academic excellence it produced over sixty years. On the Saturday, Mike Levon staged a concert in the Music Salon. In November 2007 it was announced that Bretton Hall would be developed as a luxury hotel and spa. The Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP) was founded in the college parkland by Bretton Hall lecturer Peter Murray CBE. YSP has become a leading international art centre renowned for art and performance in the landscape. When the college closed, Yorkshire Sculpture Park took over the estate grounds and lakes.Announcement from Wakefield Council about the future use of Bretton Hall, November 2007 In May 2013 a series of special visits to the former hostels (halls of residence) was co-organised by Wakefield Council, YSP, the developer Rushbond and Bretton Hall alumni. Photographs were taken of every hostel room. A further event was organised in September 2013 to visit the mansion. Rushbond will ensure that a complete photographic record will be taken of the building before refurbishment.

Willehad was born in Northumbria and probably received his education at York under Ecgbert. He was ordained after his education, and about the year 766, he went to Frisia, preaching at Dokkum and in Overijssel,Butler, Alban. the Lives of the Saints, Vol. XI, 1866 to continue the missionary work of Boniface who had been martyred by the Frisians in 754. At an assembly in Paderborn in 777, Saxony was divided into missionary zones. The zone between the Weser and the Elbe, called Wigmodia, was given to Willehad. From 780 Willehad preached in the region of the lower Weser River on commission from Charlemagne. He barely escaped with his life when the Frisians wanted to kill him as well and he returned to the area around Utrecht. Once again he and his fellow missionaries barely escaped with their lives when the local pagans wanted to kill them for destroying some temples. Finally, in 780, Charlemagne sent him to evangelize the Saxons. He preached to them for two years but, in 782, the Saxons under Widukind, rebelled against Charlemagne and Willehad was forced to flee to Frisia. He took the opportunity to travel to Rome where he reported to Pope Adrian I on his work. Upon his return from Rome, Willehad retired for a time to the monastery of Echternach, in present- day Luxembourg. He spent two years there reassembling his missionary team. After Charlemagne's conquest of the Saxons, Willehad preached in the region around the lower Elbe and the lower Weser. In 787 Willehad was consecrated bishop, and that part of Saxony and Friesland near the mouth of the Weser was assigned to him for his diocese. He chose as his see the city of Bremen, which is mentioned for the first time in documents of 782, and built a cathedral there.

The town had a population in 2001 of 6,107, increasing to 6,519 at the 2011 Census. History The former mill, now modern housing The town was largely a small farming settlement until the industrial revolution and the sinking of collieries caused a boom in population and a need for modern housing for the workforce. This has left a town with a mixture of stone and brick buildings. The town and its neighbours were mentioned in the Domesday Book. Other industries such as quarrying for stone, agriculture and brick manufacture were also known at different periods of the town's history, with many of the former buildings and sites associated with them still existing. Former quarry site The former quarry, a nationally important site The former South Elmsall quarry was deemed a site of national importance, by Defra, due to the visible section of an unusually complete patch coral reef. Coal mining The town is most famous for its coal-mining past; it was the site of Frickley Colliery, which was one of the largest deep coal mines in the United Kingdom. The colliery invested in several improvements that were of benefit to the area, including the building of the Warde Aldam Hospital, as well as swimming baths and sports facilities. The colliery became a key source of union radicalism. During the UK Miners' Strike, there were numerous disturbances in the area. It was one of the last pits to return to work after the strike, seeing as it was picketed by a group of hardliners from Kent who continued to picket Frickley after the NUM had called off the strike. The Frickley miners refused to cross the hardliners' picket.Wakefield Express The Miners' Strike 25th anniversary special edition, p. 3, Friday 6 March 2009 The colliery was closed on 26 November 1993 following closures of nearby pits like Ferrymoor-Riddings (1985), Kinsley (1986), South Kirkby (1988) and Grimethorpe (1992). In 1998 the UK Governments \\"Social Exclusion Unit\\" published a series of \\"Policy Action Team\\" reports looking at issues of social exclusion. The Skills report used South Elmsall and surrounding towns as a case study and stated \\"The local communities still suffer from serious environmental, social and economic problems - and a crisis of morale - as a result of the loss of jobs in the mining industry\\". Warde-Aldam Hospital The Warde-Aldam Hospital was a hospital situated in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, England. It was built in 1911 by Carlton Main Colliery Ltd and was used as a general, voluntary hospital until 1948. It was then taken over by the NHS and provided acute hospital care until 1978.\\"The National Archives: Hospital Records\\" The National Archives. U.K. Web. 28 April 2017. Music The town is home to Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band, a successful brass band who have been British and European champions. Frickley Country Park Frickley Country Park officially opened in September 2009, after a long period of land reclamation, environmental cleaning and landscaping of the former Frickley Colliery site was finished. The site offers walks and play areas as well as space for new housing development as part of the wider regeneration scheme. Nearby is located the Frickley Off-road Centre, a specialist facility for motorsports. Local economy Jackson Stores, Barnsley Road Billiard Hall, Barnsley Road The large, traditional market is a central feature of the shopping area of the town, with approximately 105 trading stalls. On the main high street there are shops featuring many household names such as The Post Office, Hallmark Cards, Specsavers, Boots Group and Greggs alongside many other independent shops offering a range of goods and services such as travel, boutique fashion, wedding dress hire, sportswear, a flooring and furniture store and much more. On the outskirts of the town is the Dale Lane Industrial Estate which is home to a number of large, internationally recognised companies. For example, there are a number of Next Distribution warehouses. The estate itself reflects the change in industry of the area, being one of the key expansion areas since the closure of the local collieries. Education Carlton, Moorthorpe, Northfield and Ash Grove are the primary education schools in South Elmsall. The main source of secondary and further education in the town is Minsthorpe Community College, which also provides places to residents of South Kirkby and Upton. In 2008 Minsthorpe Community College gained its best ever results at all levels ‚Äì KS3/GCSE/A-Level, the college GCSE results are higher than the local and national averages. The school also hosts a number of other facilities such as a sports and fitness suite, all weather floodlit sports pitches, a gym and an upcoming public swimming pool. The school and its science and sporting facilities were upgraded as one of the host training facilities for the London 2012 Olympic Games. Among a number of well known people who have an association with Minsthorpe include playwright John Godber, actors Adrian Hood and Chris Walker and footballers Jamie and John McCombe. Transport South Elmsall railway station South Elmsall is served by rail, the nearest station being South Elmsall railway station. The main bus station is also situated beside the railway station.

It has views over the sea and the rocky islet Tindh√≥lmur with its many peaks, G√°sh√≥lmur and the two \\"drangar\\", (tall, pointed clifftops sticking up from the sea). This motif is known on many paintings and photographs. The old houses in the village are bunched together with narrow lanes between them, and at the western end stands the cosy church, which was built in 1865. B√∏ur is an ancient settlement and is mentioned in the so-called Dog Letter dating from 1350 AD, but it is probably older. The village is also mentioned as having a church in a document dated 1710, but it is not known when the first village church was built. Eiriksbo√∞i The best-known story from B√∏ur tells of a dispute about succession to property. Two brothers, Simun and Eirikur, owned all the village property jointly, but Eirikur was keen to have it divided. In the end Eirikur killed his brother, and then travelled over to Kirkjub√∏ur to beg the bishop for mercy. The bishop was inclined to grant him absolution if he paid a large penalty to the bishop and to the church. Eirikur agreed, and the contract was carved out on a wooden beam. Eirikur sailed back to B√∏ur, but when he reached the still waters and thought he was out of danger, a great wave rose up, the boat capsized, and he was drowned. The hidden reef has been known ever since as Eiriksbo√∞i in memory of the event, and is situated on the inner side of Tindh√≥lmur. To Steal Fire The village land consists of eighteen fields of enclosed and open land, most of it being owned by the king (and is now national property). Another old story tells how ownership passed to the king. The settlement was very tiny at the time, perhaps only a single household, and one day the fire in the hearth went out. This meant an ignominious journey to the next settlement to ask for fire, and a young girl was sent off to S√∏rv√°gur. She was lucky and found nobody at home, so she took some burning wood from the fire and hurried back home. Unfortunately the smoke from the fire had been seen, and the farmer from S√∏rv√°gur accused her of stealing the fire. As a penalty, most of B√∏ur became royal estate property.

It had a total projected length of 66 miles but never reached Barnsley, stopping a few miles short at Stairfoot. The name was changed to The Hull and Barnsley Railway (H&BR;) in 1905. Its Alexandra Dock in Hull opened 16 July 1885. The main line ran from Hull to Cudworth, with two other lines branching off at Wrangbrook Junction, the South Yorkshire Junction Railway to Denaby, and The Hull & South Yorkshire Extension Railway, an eight-mile branch to Wath-upon-Dearne, opened 31 March 1902. The company also had joint running powers on the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway (Gowdall and Braithwell Railway). Before the Grouping of 1923, the line was taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER). Following incorporation into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), duplicated infrastructure was closed or reduced in function ‚Äì notably Cannon Street station and the Springhead Locomotive Works. Closure of the greater part of the main line itself came during the time of British Railways. As of 2011 the elevated line in Hull with some of the extensions and alterations added by the NER and LNER are still in use and referred to as the Hull Docks Branch and has the Engineers' Line Reference of HJS. Background By the 19th century the coalfields of southern Yorkshire were producing large amounts of coal, the industrialised midland region was making manufactured goods, and the new industrial towns of the West Riding of Yorkshire and of Lancashire were producing cloth and other goods. Thus opportunities for trade, export and profit existed along the east coast of England as well as along the Humber and the tributary rivers feeding it. Goole had risen from nothing as a port on the Ouse with the creation of the Knottingley to Goole Canal in 1826 by the Aire and Calder Canal Company; the port, built to generous specifications rapidly gained inward and outward trade ‚Äì much to the chagrin of Hull, and spurred the development of the extension of the Leeds and Selby Railway to Hull which opened in 1840. Additionally the North Eastern Railway ‚Äì which had a monopoly on rail transport to Hull ‚Äì prevented other rail companies investing there, and so Goole gained its own railway by the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway (later part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) in 1848. A custom-built railway dock and the use of specialised coal barges and unloading facilities, as well as the backing of the Aire and Calder Canal company, made it a very viable competitor to Hull for trade. Additionally, as a competitor to the port of Hull (and equally well placed for European trade), Grimsby began to grow after the 1840s when the Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company built a rail connection, and the Royal Dock was completed in 1852. Hull had expanded rapidly during the 18th century with shipping tonnages increasing over ten times in that period, and numerous docks supplementing and connecting Old Dock (Queen's Dock) being built by the Dock company in the 19th: Humber Dock 1809, Junction Dock (Prince's Dock) 1829, by 1846 Railway Dock connected to the Hull and Selby Railway (later part of the NER), as well as Victoria Dock (1850), Albert Dock (1869) and St Andrews Dock (1883). Despite all this activity, the Dock company was criticised for lack of action ‚Äì specifically with regard to construction of facilities that would make Hull a foremost coal-exporting port. Additionally, the NER ‚Äì whose interests in the north-east of England were in competition with Hull, and which held a monopoly on rail transport to Hull ‚Äì was viewed with mistrust, suspicion, dissatisfaction and even hate, so much that schemes for independent railways or a company other than the NER were proposed that would build a line to Hull, including a bridge over, and tunnels under, the Humber were being actively promoted by Hull merchants. The situation became untenable when, in 1872, with the NER refusing or unable to transport shipments from the port, deliveries of fish were delayed, and there was a general traffic jam on the rails:The running powers granted by the NER to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway to its goods depot at Kingston Street (1873) in Hull may have exacerbated the situation. The plans finally found fruition in 1880 in the charge of Col. Gerald Smith (a Hull banker) and through the cooperation of the Hull Corporation (including the sale of land to the railway, and an investment of ¬£100,000). As part of the Hull Corporation's involvement with the scheme came the power to veto any joint workings with other railway companies or selling or leasing of land, and despite the opposition of the NER (which had been instrumental in blocking previous plans), the Bill of Parliament was passed with minor alterations on 26 August 1880. The company The Hull, Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company (formed 1879) began work on the new line and associated deep-water dock which was completed by 1885. The HB&WRJ; Railway and Dock company In full, the Hull, Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock company. =Construction (1880‚Äì1885)= For construction of the line Parliament authorised a share issue of ¬£3,000,0000 and loans of ¬£1,000,000. The engineer for the main line was William Shelford, whilst Stephen Best was responsible for the Hull section, and Benjamin Baker designed the Alexandra Dock. The contractors were Messrs. Lucas and Aird. The line was one of the earlier built with the aid of steam navvies. The spoil excavated by men and machines from tunnels and cuttings was used to build embankments elsewhere Around 8,000 navvies, including both Scots and Irish as well as English, were employed in the constructions, the largest concentration of which was to be found at Riplingham (near to the Drewton tunnel). The average wage was 15 shillings for a 58-hour week. Eastern Portal: Weedley Tunnel, 2010 The Weedley Tunnel was not originally planned; the track was to skirt the hill to the south. However unstable ground meant that the line tunnelled through the hill instead.Building the Hull and Barnsley Railway, 1985, p. 24 The South Kirby tunnel passed through Magnesian Limestone to reach the lower beds of sandstone, and clay. Excavation of tunnels and cuttings included the practice of tunnelling into the rock, placing charges, then moving up the contractors wagons and detonating the charges so that the blasted rock would fall into the wagons.Building the Hull and Barnsley Railway, 1985, p. 20 One of the notable features of the line was the number of bridges it required, a result of the elevated nature of the Hull section where it crossed roads, waterways, and the line of the NER. Additionally, being built after the Railway Mania of the 1840s it had to cross numerous already existent lines in southern Yorkshire. Over one hundred bridges were required, with over 20 within the urban area of Hull alone.C.T. Goode in Railways of Hull quotes a figure of 35 within the town boundary (undated), whilst G.D. Parkes (The Hull and Barnsley Railway) notes nine substantial underline bridges ... in the first four miles. A survey using Ordnance Survey maps of the period shows that there were more than 20 within the urbanised area. Later developments in Hull led to the construction or alteration of further bridges. thumb The majority (eighty eight) of the bridges were of plate girder construction with usually three plate sides (one central) supporting cross-beams on which the track was supported. For longer spans a girder \\"N\\" truss design was usedA close variation or example of the Pratt truss These larger bridges incorporate rollers on one end to allow for the thermal expansion of the bridge. For other long spans, and for the two swing bridges on the line (Ouse and Hull bridges), open girder truss of approximately parabolic shape (open truss bowstring) were used. Both swing bridges were manufactured by Messrs. Handyside of Derby. In addition to wrought iron bridges, brick arches were also used, both for crossing small dykes and country lanes, as well as the abutments to bridges and in place of embankments on short sections between bridges. At Beverley Road, Willerby & Kirk Ella, North Cave and Wallingfen were two-storey buildings with the upper storey accessing the embanked track. Stations were built in the English Queen Anne revival style ‚Äì with decorative external brick courses between floors and brick lintels; minor embellishments on other brick structures such as bridge buttresses roughly echoed the same style. In July 1884 work stopped for 5 months, through a failure to raise funds through a share issue to pay the workers. Parliament allowed the additional debts to be taken for the work to continue, by completion the total share issue was ¬£6,000,000 and the loans ¬£3,500,000. At this point the line was almost complete but the subsequent cost cutting meant that the planned grand terminus close to the centre of Hull was never built. =Description of the Line and assets= Hull to Springhead 1914 Railway map of Hull Much of the assets of the Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company lay in Hull.The term 'junction' in the company's name means that it was a line that connected at a railway junction, rather than reaching a destination such as a major city; this junction (or junctions) lay at the Barnsley end of the line, meaning that there was relatively little infrastructure at that end. The line terminated in Hull at three main points: Alexandra Dock; for import and export of goods by sea, Cannon Street station (a goods station and also the passenger terminus), and Neptune Street goods station, the main goods terminus. The HB&WRJR;&DCo;'s main asset was Alexandra Dock. At the time of its construction it was the largest in Britain at and was expanded by in 1889. The entrance lock was long at wide. Two graving docks, one long and wide, the other a little bigger were also built at the north-east corner of the dock. Its primary purpose was the export of coal; in the opposite direction pit props, as well as cut wood were transported. Distances on the line (mileposts) were measured from Alexandra Dock, and the up direction was from Hull to Barnsley. From here the track rose, joining the embankment, and crossed Hedon Road,Hedon Road, now a section of the A1033 beginning its curved route round Hull by numerous bridges, crossing roads, drains, and the North Eastern Railway's own track, the first major crossing after Hedon Road being the NER's Hull to Withernsea Line. Next was a minor goods yard situated at Burleigh Street, then the Foredyke Stream (a drainage canal) and the NER's Hull to Hornsea Line were crossed close together. The line then crossed the River Hull at the Hull Bridge, and then branches (from the down direction) serving Sculcoates goods yard (southward) and the British Gas Light Company's gas works (northward). Westward from Sculcoates goods yard a spur ran backwards to serve Hull Corporation's own electricity power plant (opened 1895). After Sculcoates junction and the Beverley and Barmston Drain came Beverley Road junction where the line from Cannon Street station coming from the south-east joined the westward-travelling main line. The branch to Cannon Street station first passed Beverley Road station, almost immediately after the junction. Beverley Road station was a two-storey building with the upper storey accessing the embanked track.The far side platforms at Beverley Road were accessed by a brick-lined (and tiled?) passenger tunnel (subway) under the embankment, still in existence in 2010 but closed. The line then curved south and after a 1 in 50 descent reached the level again and terminated at Cannon Street. Initially Cannon Street was intended to be a carriage shed with the main station building situated closer to the centre of town at Charlotte Street near Kingston Square where the company's offices where located. Lack of funds, and the expense of purchasing expensive real estate in the centre of the town meant that Cannon Street became the main terminus. The station was in one of the most densely populated areas of the town, close to the river and its associated seed oil and varnish works, the buildings being quickly constructed of wood, and surrounded by the company's own coal yards, all of which would have given a poor impression compared with the facilities offered by the NER. From Beverley Road junction the main line continued west crossing Newland Avenue, and the NER's Hull to Cottingham Line before reaching a triangle of track (or Wye) where a line turned south to terminate at Neptune Street goods station. Before reaching Neptune Street, after a branch to a smaller goods station at Dairycoates to the east of the north‚Äìsouth track, the line curved east and crossed the NER's main line to Paragon Station at Hessle Road junction by an open girder truss bowstring bridge. From the wye of track at Springbank junctions on the route towards Barnsley the line continued west past the Springhead works. The works were built on green-field land north of the main line outside the then area of urbanisation of Hull, and expanded considerably post opening. At Springhead, south of the main line, there was a through goods loop which also gave access to a considerable area of sidings operated from 1908 onwards. From the Springhead yard Hull Corporation's Springhead Waterworks was supplied with coal to power its steam-driven pumping engine. Springhead to Aire junction Remains in 1961 of Barmby station Beyond Springhead the line continued on embanked track towards Willerby and Kirk Ella station, then crossing the small shallow valley at Eppleworth in the foothills of the Yorkshire Wolds by a brick viaduct (locally known as \\"five arches\\"). From here the line rose to Little Weighton station via a deep cutting. Then the line reached a high point of after inclines of up to 1 in 100 before entering the Drewton Tunnel after which the descent grade was 1 in 150 for seven miles, passing through Sugar Loaf Tunnel and Weedley Tunnel further west, both shorter tunnels of , and then South Cave and North Cave stations. Beyond North Cave the land is flat, and the line turned steadily south-west aiming for Barnsley, passing through Newport, Sandholme, and Eastrington, before passing over the NER's Hull to Selby Line followed by Howden and Barmby stations. The next major obstacle of the River Ouse was crossed by a swing bridge at Long Drax. The minor station of Drax preceded a crossing under the NER's Selby to Goole Line after which was Carlton station and then the first of the junctions with other railways through which the Hull and Barnsley obtained much of its traffic. South of Aire junction Almost immediately after a bridge crossing over the River Aire, a branch heading north-south joined the line at Aire junction; this was jointly operated by the H&BR; and Great Central Railway which opened in 1916 and was known as the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Line. 1914 Railway map showing the lines crossing of the NER main line just after Gowdall junction Less than a mile south-west of Aire junction a westward junction (Gowdall junction) connected the H&BR; to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) at Hensall junction via a short chord. The main line continued south-west and crossed over the same L&Y; line (the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway then owned by the L&YR;). About a mile further on the line crossed over the NER main line to Selby (the former East Coast Main Line via Shaftholme and Selby. The line then crossed the Knottingley and Goole Canal, then went over another L&YR; line (connecting Knottingley to Shaftholme junction) before arriving in Kirk Smeaton station. 1910 railway map showing the line south of Kirk Smeaton including Wrangbrook junction and the Wath branch After Kirk Smeaton the terrain becomes hilly again, but with Magnesian Limestone replacing the softer chalk found in the Wolds; after a cutting the line entered the South Kirby Tunnel (commonly known as the Barnsdale Tunnel) before reaching Wrangbrook Junction. Here the South Yorkshire Junction Railway (opened 1894) branched south and then south-east ultimately for Denaby, whilst The Hull & South Yorkshire Extension Railway (opened 1902) branched soon after travelling roughly south towards Wath, whilst the line heading for Barnsley continued roughly west-south-west. 1911 Railway map showing south-western portion of the line from Hemsworth to Cudworth and Stairfoot After Upton the line crossed over the Swinton and Knottingley joint line (Midland and North Eastern railways), shortly after a branch west from Hemsworth East junction connected the line to the West Riding and Grimsby joint line which was operated by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire (after 1897 the Great Central) and Great Northern railways; which was then passed over by the continuation of the H&BR; main line. The next station was Hemsworth. The final tunnel on the line was Brierley Tunnel which is long. The line then passed westward through Brierley junction where a southward-turning chord connected with the Dearne Valley Railway on which the H&BR; had running powers. A northward continuation of the Dearne Valley Railway was then passed under. Finally Cudworth was reached: first was Cudworth Goods station; then Cudworth North junction, where the line split into two main branches; a third branch west joined the Midland Railway via goods exchange sidings. The westernmost of the two main branches crossed the Midland Line by girder truss bridge, then a spur to Monk Bretton station left west, whilst the final part of the line continued to Stairfoot junction where it joined the Great Central main line. The easterly branch ran to Cudworth station where there was a platform, but no connection. The line's second locomotive depot was found at Cudworth, as well as marshalling yards. The whole main line as built was double tracked. =Operation and events (1885‚Äì1922)= The HB&WRJR;&DCo.; began business with large amounts of debt, and within a year of its opening a price war had begun between the Hull Dock Company and the Hull and Barnsley on dock charges, and between the Hull and Barnsley and the NER on transit charges. Neither of the two Hull-based companies could expect to win against the much larger North Eastern Railway. By 1887 the HB&WRJR;&DCo.; was seeking a way out of debt and approached the Midland Railway for a possible merger. Reasonable terms were made, but the proposal was rejected by the shareholders of the Hull company. An amalgamation by the NER itself was then proposed, which would have included the NER paying off the HB&WRJR;&DCo.;'s debts; this scheme too was rejected. The Hull and Barnsley, unable to pay its debts, went into receivership for two years until 1889. The Hull Dock Company amalgamated with the NER in the early 1893, ‚Äì requiring another act of parliament ‚Äì one condition of which was that in the event of the NER building another dock in Hull (which had already been planned in 1891 as part of an unsuccessful merger attempt between the H,B&WRJ; and the NER) the Hull and Barnsley should give its consent, and be able to make the new dock a joint operation between the two railway companies. Additionally an agreement was reached that there would be no reduction in dock duties without prior agreement or discussion. In 1894 the South Yorkshire Junction Railway opened. Though independent, it was worked by Hull and Barnsley engines, and connected the company to more collieries. In the following years of the 1890s various proposals, including another to merge the NER and HB&WRJR;&DCo.;, and others for expansion of the Hull docks came, but were blocked by one party's interests or another's. Finally in 1899 both railway companies had agreed to the construction of a new dock, to the east of Alexandra Dock, access to which was from the HB&WRJ;'s elevated line via an extension from Alexandra Dock, and from a joint line branching off the H&BR; at Bridges Junction. In 1902 an extension from Wrangbrook junction opened, connecting to Wath and further collieries. From 1905 cooperation with the Midland allowed trains to run all the way to Sheffield via Cudworth; the same year Edward Watkin, nephew of Sir Edward Watkin, became general manager of the company. For these express trains bogie coaches were purchased and M. Stirling's 4-4-0 tender locomotives used. From 1907 at Sandholme there were marshalling yards and a turntable, enabling freight trains to be split in two for the steep section towards Hull into the Wolds hills. After exiting receivership, the fortunes of the Hull and Barnsley recovered and it began to pay reasonable dividends on ordinary stock. In 1905 the Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company officially changed its name to the shorter Hull and Barnsley Railway. The same year running powers were obtained and a junction made with the Dearne Valley Railway. Also in that year the National Radiator company opened in Hull. The site was served by a siding from Ella Street on the H&BR; line, as well as being accessed by a siding from the NER on the Hull to Bridlington line, forming a non-official line link between the networks of H&BR; and NER. Construction of the new dock ‚Äì \\"King George V Dock\\" ‚Äì was completed by 1914. In 1916 the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway opened, adding to the number of collieries from which the company could transport coal. Engine Sheds The following engine sheds were operated by the H&BR;: * Cudworth * Hensall * Springhead engine shed, Hull * Alexandra Dock engine shed (Hull) * Bullcroft * Denaby * Millhouses * Doncaster York Road * Wrangbrook =Accidents and incidents= *On 23 December 1903, a passenger train collided with wagons on the line at Springhead Junction, Hull. Locomotive No.34 with a train of 5 four wheel carriages and a fish van ran into the back of a formation of a brake van and 11 loaded mineral wagons which had detached unnoticed from an earlier train due to a broken coupling. The driver was seriously injured, passengers reported only minor injuries. *At around midnight 25 September 1907 the boiler of F2 locomotive No. 109 exploded. The train was halted whilst the fireman was collecting a signal token before Wrangbrook Junction near Wath when the boiler exploded. The driver, John Edward Brook, was blown 400 yards by the blast and was badly scalded and injured; he was taken to Beckett Hospital in Barnsley but died 4 days later. An inquest was held, where a boiler specialist reported that 30 ‚Öû\\" stays had given way ‚Äì the stays had been over repaired without replacement; it was noted that suspect stays had been reported in March, and that a boilersmith had previously warned the stays required replacement. A verdict of accidental death was returned, on the basis of an error of judgement having been made. =Rolling stock and vessels= Locomotives The H&BR; never manufactured any of its own locomotives, all being built elsewhere. The first types in use were of the design W. Kirtley (Locomotive Superintendent of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway) who was acting as a consultant. Matthew Stirling (son of Patrick Stirling of 'Stirling Single' fame) was the first and only Locomotive superintendent of the H&BR; during its independence, and who undertook the rebuilding of some of Mr. Kirtley's designs, as well as contracting the construction of his own designs to various builders. His locomotives were typically domeless, and many of the original Kirtley engines were also rebuilt without domes. Kirtley's locomotives were painted black with grey lining. Matthew Stirling subtly modified the livery ‚Äì using invisible green (black except in bright sunlight) produced from a 50:50 mixture of 'drop black' and 'brunswick green'. Lining was of broad stripes of blue (ultramarine) with red (vermilion) edges. The 2-4-0 and 0-6-0 tender locomotives procured by Kitley carried a small cursive monogram of the letters \\"HB&WRJR;\\", other locomotives carried the initials \\"H&BR;\\". A total of 186 engines were operated by the Hull and Barnsley Railway, on merging into the NER the locomotives were briefly renumbered by adding 3000 to the original number. Following the incorporation into the LNER soon after the surviving locomotives were assigned numbers between 2405 and 2542, in no specific order. Most except the H&BR; Class F3 (LNER Class N13) were withdrawn between 1930 and 1940, the B Class beginning withdrawal earlier in 1925. The last F3 was withdrawn in 1956. Rolling stock Initially the railway used 2-axle coaches, by the time services to Sheffield were introduced the company had 4-axle composite corridor coaches on bogies. Most of the rolling stock was for freight; in 1923 the company had 4,808 freight wagons of which over 3,000 were open wagons. Additionally the company possessed a snow plough, since the cuttings in the Yorkshire Wolds were prone to drifts when snow occurred. Ships and watercraft The company operated a number of vessels in relation to the construction, operation and maintenance of the Alexandra Dock; those vessels included: * Alexandra ‚Äì tug built by Earle's shipbuilding of Hull in 1885. * Barnsley ‚Äì tug ‚Äì a sister of \\"Alexandra\\" built in 1886 but not by the same builder. * Hull ‚Äì tug built by J.P. Rennoldson of South Shields in 1898. * \\"H.& B.R. No. 1\\", \\"H.& B.R. No. 2\\" and \\"H.& B.R. No. 3\\" ‚Äì static dumb dredgers. * \\"H.& B.R. No. 4\\" ‚Äì built by Jonkeers of Kinderdijk in 1914 ; grab dredger engined by Earle's of Hull. Transferred to N.E.R in 1922 and renamed \\"N.E.R Grab No. 4\\" and to the L.N.E.R. in 1923. Renamed \\"H. & B.R. Dredger No. 4\\" in 1938 and ownership changed again in 1948 to the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive and then to B.T. Docks Board. Eventually sold to Italian interests and broken up in 1963. History 1922‚Äìpresent =As part of the NER (1922‚Äì1923)= The Railways Act 1921 ended the company's independence; from 1 April 1922 the Hull and Barnsley Railway became part of the NER. The locomotive works at Springhead was downgraded ‚Äì the extent of locomotive maintenance was reduced and the carriage works closed, skilled workers and machinery were relocated to Darlington. At this time 43 old engines were decommissioned. Edward Watkin (General Manager) and Matthew Stirling also departed. Due to duplication a number of stations were renamed. Incorporation into the NER was just part of a larger scale of consolidation throughout the British railway system, and on 1 January 1923 the NER along with the Hull and Barnsley Line became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). =As part of the LNER (1923‚Äì1948)= Cannon Street station in Hull ceased to be used a passenger station in 1924, this coincided with the construction of a chord to the NER line just north-west of Walton Street level crossing to the elevated line.The chord allowed through running between the H&BR; outside Hull and Paragon station Mainline freight work commonly used the ex Great Central Robinson 2-8-0 locomotives (later classified as LNER Class O4). The NER Class P1 0-6-0, NER Class Y 4-6-2T, NER Class T and NER Class T2 0-8-0 locomotives inherited from the NER also replaced Hull and Barnsley types on other freight work. In 1929 a halt west of Springhead works and sidings was constructed, The station was unstaffed, and possibly the smallest in Britain, with two wooden platforms one coach in length each (25 ft). The same month the Springhead Halt opened passenger services between Wath and Kirk Smeaton ended. Passenger services between South Howden and Cudworth ceased in 1932. =As part of British Railways (1948‚Äì1994)= Mainline freight continued to be worked by 2-8-0 locomotives, with WD Austerity 2-8-0 being ubiquitous. 8F type 2-8-0 locomotives also became common on the southern sections of the line, after through working ended (1958). (A large number of the class were purchased by the LNER from the war department after the Second World War, and in 1948 by the British Transport Commission.) In 1951 a single sided station halt (Boothferry Park Halt railway station) was built on the branch in Hull between Springhead south junction and Neptune Street to serve the Hull City Football club (directly situated next to the line), the service ended in 1986.In 2002 Hull City moved to a new stadium rendering the halt obsolete, the old stadium \\"Boothferry Park\\" was demolished between 2008 and 2010. The locomotive shed at Cudworth closed in 1951. Passenger services between Hull and South Howden ended in 1955. Through freight on the same line ended in 1958, with complete closure between Little Weighton and Wrangbrook junction in 1959. Freight working on remaining sections west of Hull (Springhead) closed completely in the next decade; the section between Moorhouse and Wrangbrook: 1963, between Little Weighton and Springhead : 1964, between Wrangbrook and both Monckton as well as Sprotborough in 1967, Cudworth to Monckton in 1968. In Hull the bridge over the NER main line at Hessle Road was removed in 1962 and the elevated H&BR; dock branch section became connected to the Hull to Selby Line at Hessle Road junction as part of a scheme to reduce the number of level crossings in Hull by routing all rail traffic to east Hull via the elevated Hull and Barnsley Line. All traffic from Cudworth to Wrangbrook junction ended in 1967. The branch to Cannon Street closed completely in 1968. By 1970 the only parts of the line still with traffic were the Hull elevated section, and a few short sections with industrial uses. Alexandra Dock closed in the 1980s and the rail connection was removed, subsequently the dock re-opened but without a rail connection. Part of the elevated line to King George Dock was converted to a single line in 1988 and one train working introduced, four years later increased amounts of imports; specifically coal; meant that staffed (tokenised) working was reintroduced in 1992. Part of the path of the line between Hensall and Drax was opened for Merry Go Round trains to Drax Power Station in 1972, the Long Drax swing bridge on the Ouse to the north-east offered a link for future developments and was maintained until 1968, but was dismantled in 1976. =Post privatisation (1994‚Äì)= Hull Docks Branch Hessle Road Junction relaying Christmas 2007 In 2007 over ¬£10 million was allocated to a project to increase capacity on the former Hull and Barnsley Railway branch to the Hull docks. Network Rail, Associated British Ports, Yorkshire Forward, Hull City Council and The Northern Way were involved in funding or supporting the scheme. The work was to include partial re-doubling of the line, remedial and replacement work on the numerous bridges, and signalling upgrades, and to increase the line speed to except at Hull Bridge. The capacity of the line was to be increased from 10 to 22 trains in each direction. In late 2007 the Network Rail gave the contract to GrantRail (now VolkerRail). Work carried out included the re-instatement of a double track junction at Hessle Road (the junction with the main line, previously singled in 1984), restoration of double track from New Bridge Road to King George Dock, and removal of Ella Street bridge along with strengthening of 15 others. The upgraded line was formally opened in June 2008 by the transport minister Rosie Winterton. Work continued on the line after the official opening; the upgraded signalling system began use in September 2008. Work on the ABP owned portion of the track was carried out by Trackwork Ltd. of Doncaster, at a cost of over ¬£2.5 million. In 2013 two bridges were replaced on the docks branch: a minor bridge, over James Reckitt Avenue, replaced at a cost of about ¬£1 million, and a major bridge replacement, over Spring Bank West, costing ¬£3.2 million. In July 2014 an attempt to solve a pigeon roosting problem under the Chanterlands Avenue railway bridge led to \\"hundreds of inch long maggots\\" from the carcasses of dead birds falling off the bridge onto a footpath, described by one passer-by as \\"like something out of a horror film\\". Use of closed parts of the line Drapers Metal merchants used the Sculcoates, and later part of the former Neptune Street goods yards as part of their scrap metal business ‚Äì during the 1960s many steam locomotives were dismantled there. The cutting at Little Weighton, and nearby chalk quarries were used after closure (from 1969) as a landfill facility; filling of the quarries and cutting was approaching completion by 2008. After 2008 a site on the cutting near Willerby has been used as a recycling facility. The line at Weedley Tunnel in 2008; the line in the Yorkshire Wolds was a scenic section of the line, and featured in the railway's promotional material for passenger traffic In rural areas the embankments and earthworks remain as boundaries between fields, the trackbed west of Weedley Tunnel forms part of the Yorkshire Wolds Way and High Hunsley Circuit walks, and a section of the embankment between Kirk Ella and Hull also carries a footpath whilst a section further west is covered by the B1232 road. A section over 2 miles long north of Newport is now part of the eastern end of M62 motorway. A number of the stations have been converted into private residences. The areas of disused land west and east of Calvert Lane in Hull (formerly Springhead works and sidings and the land between Springbank East, West and South junctions) have become a wildlife habitat, the area between the junctions being assessed as \\"ecologically outstanding\\". and are classed as Sites of nature conservance importance and is a candidate site for \\"Local Nature Reserve status\\". The disused railway bridge giving walkers access to the western site was removed in August 2009. The former sidings at Calvert Lane were developed into a small housing estate \\"The Sidings\\" in the 2010s. Preservation The Hull & Barnsley Railway Stock Fund owns and restores the few surviving vehicles which once belonged to the H&BR.; Two coaches, two wagons and a tool van are kept on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. No locomotives have survived.

A two-spool design in the 17,000 lbf (76 kN) thrust class, the J75 was essentially the bigger brother of the Pratt & Whitney J57 (JT3C). It was known in civilian service as the JT4A, and in a variety of stationary roles as the GG4 and FT4. Design and development In military use, the J75 was used on the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, Lockheed U-2, and Republic F-105 Thunderchief. It was also utilized in the prototype and experimental Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, Lockheed A-12, Martin P6M SeaMaster, North American YF-107, and Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III. Before the arrival of the Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofan engine, the JT4A was used to power certain Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 models, bringing improved field performance in the medium-range Boeing 707-220 and Douglas DC-8-20, and intercontinental range in the Boeing 707-320 and the Douglas DC-8-30. By late 1959, P&W; had considered introducing a turbofan version of the J75, which was to have tentatively been named the TF75 or JT4D.Flight Magazine, October 30, 1959. p 458 Apparently, little interest was shown by the aircraft industry, so the variant was dropped. =Marine & power generation= After its relatively short lifetime in the aircraft role, the JT4A found more enduring use in the naval role, where the FT4 was produced in a variety of models between 18,000 and 22,000 hp. Well-known uses include the first all-turbine warships, the Canadian s, as well as the United States Coast Guard's s, the 1970s-built icebreakers USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11) and USCGC Polar Star (WAGB-10) (each 3 engines in CODOG configuration), and it was considered for the US Navy's . The same basic powerplant saw much wider use as a peak demand power turbine running on natural gas.

The Farmstead in Depil In the early 19th century the village of Depil was practically derelict. The farmers had left the place, the ownership of the land was in the hands of outsiders, and half the cultivated soil had turned into wilderness again. At the census in 1801, there were only three old people left, and the village was probably abandoned for some years up to 1815. But in the fall of 1815, a man called √ìli √Årantsson, born 1766, and his wife Anna √ìlad√≥ttir moved from Nor√∞toftir to Depil, and life returned to the ancient village.

The first HMV-branded store was opened by the Gramophone Company on Oxford Street in 1921, and the HMV name was also used for television and radio sets manufactured from the 1930s onwards. The retail side of the business began to expand in the 1960s, and in 1998 was divested from EMI, the successor to the Gramophone Company, to form what would become HMV Group. HMV stands for His Master's Voice, the title of a painting by Francis Barraud of Nipper, the mixed Terrier listening to a cylinder phonograph, which was bought by the Gramophone Company in 1899. For advertising purposes this was changed to a wind-up gramophone, and eventually used simply as a silhouette. HMV owned the Waterstone's bookshop chain from 1998 until 2011, and has owned the music retailer Fopp since August 2007. It purchased a number of former Zavvi stores in February 2009, and also branched into live music venue management that year by purchasing MAMA Group. It sold the group in December 2012. On 15 January 2013, HMV Group plc entered administration.HMV calls in administrators as share trading suspended Deloitte was appointed to deal with the administration of the company. On 16 January 2013, HMV Ireland declared receivership, and all Irish stores were closed. A week later, on 22 January 2013, it was reported that Hilco UK would buy the debt of HMV, a step towards potentially taking control of the company. The sale of HMV's Hong Kong and Singapore business to private equity firm Aid Partners was completed on 28 February 2013. On 5 April 2013, HMV was bought out of administration by Hilco UK for an estimated ¬£50 million to form the current company. HMV Group plc, which had been listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE Fledgling Index, was liquidated in July 2014. HMV Canada is a former subsidiary which was sold to Hilco by the HMV Group in 2011. HMV Canada went into receivership in 2017 after being sued by Huk 10 Ltd., a shell company owned by Hilco. On 28 December 2018, HMV announced that the company had once again fallen into administration, just six years after a ¬£50 million takeover by Hilco UK. On 5 February 2019, just over one month after re-entering administration, HMV was acquired by the Canadian company Sunrise Records, which had bought the leases for 70 former HMV Canada properties in an effort to continue operating them as record stores. Sunrise planned to emulate the growth strategies it had used in Canada, including leveraging the renewed interest in vinyl phonographs. On 12 October 2019, Sunrise Records opened the Vaults in Birmingham the largest HMV record store. From 22 March 2020 to 15 June 2020, all HMV stores were closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. History =Origins= A record featuring the \\"His Master's Voice\\" title and Nipper The antecedents of HMV began in the 1890s at the dawn of the disc gramophone. By 1902 it had become the beginnings of the Gramophone Company. In February 1907 it commenced the building of a new dedicated record factory at Hayes, Middlesex. Disc records were sold in music shops and independent retailers at this time. In 1921 the Gramophone Company opened the first dedicated HMV shop in Oxford Street, London, in a former men's clothing shop; the composer Edward Elgar participated in the opening ceremonies. In March 1931 the Gramophone Company merged with Columbia Graphophone Company to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI). From the 1930s onwards, HMV manufactured radio and television sets and radiograms under the HMV and Marconiphone brand names in its factory in Hayes, Middlesex. =Expansion= HMV's former flagship branch on Oxford Street, London In 1966 HMV began expanding its retail operations in London. Throughout the 1970s, the company continued to expand, doubling in size, and in six years became the country's leading specialist music retailer. It faced new competition, however, from Virgin Megastores, established in 1976, and Our Price, established in 1972. Subsequently, HMV overtook Our Price in popularity and threatened its existence, having established a chain of newer, larger stores. The company opened its flagship store at a new location on Oxford Street in 1986, announcing it was the largest record store in the world at the time, and the official opening was attended by Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence. Growth continued for a third decade into the 1990s, with the company reaching over 320 stores including in 1990 its first store in the U.S. located at 86th and Lexington in New York City, which was the largest music shop in North America. HMV celebrated its 75-year anniversary in 1996. In February 1998, EMI entered into a joint venture with Advent International to form HMV Media Group led by Alan Giles, which acquired HMV's stores and Dillons, leaving EMI with a holding of around 45%. The new joint venture then bought the Waterstone's chain of bookshops to merge with Dillons. =Flotation= By 2002, EMI's holding in HMV Media was 43%, with Advent International owning 40% and management the remainder. The company floated on the London Stock Exchange later in the year as HMV Group plc, leaving EMI with only a token holding. The group became susceptible to a takeover following a poor period of trading up to Christmas 2005. Private equity firm Permira made a ¬£762 million conditional bid for the group (based on 190p a share) on 7 February 2006, which was rejected by HMV as an insufficient valuation of the company. Permira made a second offer which increased the value, although HMV declined it on 13 March 2006, subsequently issuing a statement that the offer undervalued the medium and long term prospects for the company, resulting in Permira withdrawing from bidding. =Acquisitions= A large HMV branch in Leeds incorporating an Orange shop In 2006 the HMV Group purchased the Ottakar's book chain and merged it into Waterstone's. The merger tied into HMV's strategy for growth, as many of the Ottakar's branches were in smaller towns. The Competition Commission provisionally cleared HMV Group, through Waterstone's, for takeover of the Ottakar's group on 30 March 2006, stating that the takeover would \\"not result in a substantial lessening of competition\\". Waterstone's then announced that it had successfully negotiated a takeover of Ottakar's on 31 May 2006. All 130 Ottakar's stores were rebranded as Waterstone's prior to Christmas 2006. In March 2007, new group CEO Simon Fox announced a 10% reduction over three years in the enlarged Waterstone's total store space, comprising mostly dual location shops created by the acquisition of Ottakar's. On 29 June 2007, the entertainment retailer Fopp went into administration, with the closure of 81 stores and 800 staff made redundant. On 31 July HMV bought the brand and six stores that it said had traded profitably, saving around 70 jobs. On 24 December 2008, Christmas Eve, HMV's rival Zavvi, also an entertainment retailer, entered administration. On 14 January 2009 a placing announcement by HMV revealed that it intended to acquire 14 of Zavvi's stores. On 18 February 2009 five additional Zavvi stores were purchased by HMV Group, to be rebranded as HMV outlets. An additional former Zavvi store in Exeter's Princesshay development was also added. The acquisitions were investigated and cleared by the Office of Fair Trading in April 2009. In the 2008 MCV Industry Excellence Awards, HMV was given the title Entertainment Retailer of the Year. In January 2009, HMV bought a 50% stake in MAMA Group, forming a joint venture with the group called the Mean Fiddler Group. The deal introduced the HMV brand to live music venues, including the Hammersmith Apollo. On 23 December 2009, it bought the whole of the MAMA Group in a live music takeover deal worth ¬£46 million. HMV bought 50% of 7digital for ¬£7.7 million in September 2009, as part of a strategy to increase its digital content offering. 7digital provided HMV's music download service, and the company planned to introduce an e-books service for Waterstone's. On 5 January 2011 HMV announced that profits would be at the lower end of analysts' forecasts due to falling sales, resulting in the share price falling by 20%HMV warns on store closures. Financial Times. and an announcement of the group's intention to close 40 HMV stores, as well as 20 Waterstone's stores, mainly in towns and cities where the company operated at multiple locations. The first of the store closures began at the end of January 2011. The sale of Waterstone's to A&NN; Capital Fund Management for ¬£53 million was completed on 29 June 2011, and was approved by the vast majority of shareholders at an emergency general meeting. HMV sold the Hammersmith Apollo to AEG Live and Eventim in May 2012 for ¬£32 million. It sold the remainder of MAMA Group to Lloyds Development Capital in December 2012 for ¬£7.3 million, which also included the company's 50% stake in Mean Fiddler Group. =Administration (2013)= A branch in Wakefield closing as part of the group administration (March 2013). On 15 January 2013, HMV Group appointed Deloitte as company administrators and suspended shares, putting its 4,350 UK employees at the risk of redundancy. Store gift vouchers were initially declared void since holders are classified as unsecured creditors to whom the company owed the value, but were accepted again from 22 January 2013. HMV Ireland followed by declaring receivership on 16 January 2013, which required the company under Irish law to close all its stores immediately. Restructuring firm Hilco UK bought HMV's debt from its creditors The Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, as a step towards potentially taking control of the company. It was revealed that the total debt Hilco had bought amounted to around ¬£110 million, and that HMV owed around ¬£20 million in tax to HM Revenue and Customs at the time of its entry into administration. On 31 January 2013, it was reported that 190 redundancies had been made at the head office and distribution centres. On 7 February 2013 Deloitte confirmed that 66 stores had been identified for closure. No fixed date was given for the closures but they were expected to take place in the following two months. The next day, Deloitte confirmed that an additional 60 redundancies, including the chief executive Trevor Moore, had been made at the group's offices in London, Marlow and Solihull. Deloitte confirmed on 20 February 2013 that an additional 37 stores would close. On 26 February 2013, six stores were sold to supermarket chain Morrisons. On 28 February 2013, eight stores in Hong Kong and Singapore were sold to AID Partners Capital Limited and the operation then became independent from HMV Group that was bought by Hilco UK. This transaction also enabled AID Partners Capital Limited to own the rights to use the HMV brand in Hong Kong, Macau, China, Taiwan and Singapore. By 23 March 2013, Deloitte was seeking to complete a deal to sell 120 stores as a going concern. The decision to close several stores that had previously been identified for closure were reversed following talks with landlords. By 21 March 2016, China 3D Digital Entertainment Limited acquired HMV Hong Kong operations from AID Partners Capital Limited, later renamed to HMV Digital China Group Limited. =Hilco ownership (2013‚Äì2019)= HMV reopened its original store in Oxford Street in October 2013. This store was closed on 5 February 2019 following the purchase of HMV by Sunrise Records. On 5 April 2013, Hilco UK announced that it had acquired HMV, taking the company out of administration and saving 141 of its stores and around 2,500 jobs. The total included 25 stores that had previously been selected for closure by Deloitte during the administration process. All nine Fopp stores which HMV owned were also included in the purchase. Hilco also stated that it hoped to reopen an HMV store in Ireland following the closure of all stores in the country. The takeover deal was estimated at around ¬£50 million. On 9 June 2013 it was confirmed that Hilco Capital Ireland had purchased HMV Ireland, and would reopen five stores within six weeks. The company moved its flagship Oxford Street store back to the original unit on 363 Oxford Street on 23 October 2013. HMV's existing store, formerly the largest music store in the world, closed on 14 January 2014. By 2014, HMV had gained the second highest share of the UK entertainment market, behind Amazon. The company's filing to Companies House in September 2014 revealed it had made a profit of ¬£17 million in the 11 months since it had entered administration. In January 2015, HMV overtook Amazon to become the largest retailer of physical music in the UK. However, the originally safe stores of York, Soilhull, Portsmouth and Belfast would shut. = Sunrise ownership (2019‚Äìpresent) = Interior of HMV on Lands Lane in Leeds in 2019. On 28 December 2018, HMV confirmed it had again been placed into administration. Hilco UK cited the \\"tsunami\\" of retail competition as the reason for the move. On 5 February 2019, Canadian record store chain Sunrise Records announced its acquisition of HMV Retail Ltd. from Hilco UK for an undisclosed amount. Sunrise had previously acquired the leases for over 70 HMV locations in Canada after HMV Canada entered receivership, which expanded the Ontario-based retailer into a national chain. Sunrise plans to maintain the HMV chain and five Fopp stores, but immediately closed 27 locations, including the flagship Oxford Street branch and other locations with high rent costs. Company founder Doug Putman stated that he planned to increase the chain's emphasis on vinyl phonograph sales as part of the turnaround plan: Sunrise's leverage of the vinyl revival had helped bolster the Canadian locations' performance after the shops' transitions from HMV, having sold at least 500,000 vinyl LPs in 2017 alone. Putman argued that, despite the growth of digital music sales and streaming, \\"talk about the demise of the physical business is sometimes a bit exaggerated, especially in music specialists. Most of the decline is coming from nontraditional sellers like the grocery chains. We'll be here for quite some time.\\" On 25 February 2019, the Financial Times reported that the Sunrise acquisition was valued at ¬£883,000. Following subsequent negotiations with its landlords, by late-February, HMV has reopened 13 of its stores (including one Fopp store). Operations Following the purchase by Hilco UK, it was reported that the company was seeking to reduce the number of store staff across the business, as part of an effort to save ¬£7.8 million on the wages budget. Stores would lose security staff, cashiers and supervisors, with managers required to provide cover. As of August 2016, all HMV stores in the Republic of Ireland had closed down and replaced with an online store. HMV Belfast in Northern Ireland, which re-opened up in March 2014 after a ¬£1 million pound refurbishment, was threatened with closure in February 2019. However, a deal was reached with landlords Sports Direct which allowed the store to continue trading. HMV established a joint venture with Curzon Cinemas in October 2009 as part of chief executive Simon Fox's plan to bring cinemas to HMV and Waterstone's stores across England. The first trial cinema opened above the existing HMV store in Wimbledon, in a former storage room converted into three separate screens and a bar. It has its own entrance, allowing access outside store hours, and one within the store. The trial was deemed a success, and it had been planned to open additional cinemas in HMV's Cheltenham store, and Waterstone's in Piccadilly, London. In June 2015, HMV relaunched an online store to accompany its existing music download service. One store in Singapore and five in Hong Kong, owned by the private equity firm AID Partners, traded under the HMV brand independently of the UK operations. These have since closed, with the Singapore store closing in 2015 and the final Hong Kong branch closing in 2018. Product range HMV stores stock a range of products including audio, books, Blu-rays, CDs, vinyl, DVDs, video games, record players, headphones as well as an increasing range of movie, television and music merchandise. The company launched a music download service in October 2013 (www.hmvdigital.com), provided by 7digital, which includes iOS and Android apps. The company relaunched its online store in June 2015, providing CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, and LP records for online order and home delivery with exclusive stock also available. Loyalty programme On 1 September 2008, HMV launched \\"Get Closer\\", a social networking site allowing users to import their own music library, rivalling other providers including online music stores Napster and the iTunes Store. The site was closed in September 2009. HMV operated a loyalty scheme branded as \\"purehmv\\", first launched in August 2003, but subsequently closed and relaunched in 2008. The scheme awarded cardholders points for purchases, which could be collected and redeemed on a number of rewards including vouchers to spend in-store, memorabilia and signed merchandise. \\"purehmv\\" has since closed and will be replaced by a new loyalty scheme, the launch date of which is yet to be announced.

The town has a population of Approx. 700 inhabitants. Ei√∞i was first mentioned in writing, early in the 14th Century. Carbon dating indicated that the village, was settled by Vikings in the 9th century AD. In the center of the village there is a large stone church built in 1881. until 1894, the village was part of the Eysturoy Region. in 1879 local people wrote to the national government, requesting to become an independent municipality. This request started the long and drawn out process, of creating the municipality. By the autumn of 1894 the 5 villages of Ei√∞i, Sv√≠n√°ir, Lj√≥s√°, Oyri and Nor√∞sk√°li elected to form an independent municipality with the main village being Ei√∞i. Ei√∞i housed the seat of the local government. The first mayor was Gregers Joensen, additionally he was the first educated teacher of The Faroe Islands receiving his diploma from the Faroese Teachers School in 1871, and serving as the local teacher from 1871 until his death on 12 June 1897 at the age of 61. in 1943 The villages of Nor√∞sk√°li, Oyri and Sv√≠n√°ir requested to opt out of the municipality. At the municipal meeting, a majority voted for Nor√∞sk√°li and Oyri leaving the municipality, However Sv√≠n√°ir eventually decided against leaving.

The term amalgam is used for alloys, intermetallic compounds, and solutions (both solid solutions and liquid solutions) involving mercury as a major component. Sodium amalgams are often used in reactions as strong reducing agents with better handling properties compared to solid sodium. They are less dangerously reactive toward water and in fact are often used as an aqueous suspension. Sodium amalgam was used as a reagent as early as 1862. A synthesis method was described by J. Alfred Wanklyn in 1866. Structure and compositions No particular formula is assigned to \\"sodium amalgam\\". Na5Hg8 and Na3Hg are well defined compounds. In sodium amalgams, the Hg-Hg distances are expanded to around 5 √Ö vs. about 3 √Ö for mercury itself. Usually amalgams are classified on the weight percent of sodium. Amalgams with 2% Na are solids at room temperature, whereas some more dilute amalgams remain liquid.Keith R. Buszek \\"Sodium Amalgam\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2001, John Wiley. Preparation Metallic sodium dissolves in mercury exothermically, i.e. with the release of heat, therefore, formation of sodium amalgam is famously dangerous for generating sparks. The process causes localised boiling of the mercury and for this reason the formation is usually conducted in a fume hood and often performed using air-free techniques, such as synthesis under anhydrous liquid paraffin. Sodium amalgam may be prepared in the laboratory by dissolving sodium metal in mercury or the reverse.3% Na in Hg: see the Notes in Procedure for making Na(Hg) by addition of Na to Hg: Sodium amalgams can be purchased from chemical supply houses. Uses Sodium amalgam has been used in organic chemistry as a powerful reducing agent, which is safer to handle than sodium itself. It is used in Emde degradation, and also for reduction of aromatic ketones to hydrols. A sodium amalgam is used in the design of the high pressure sodium lamp providing sodium to produce the proper color, and mercury to tailor the electrical characteristics of the lamp. =Mercury cell electrolysis= Sodium amalgam is a by-product of chlorine manufactured by mercury cell electrolysis. In this cell, brine (concentrated sodium chloride solution) is electrolysed between a liquid mercury cathode and a titanium or graphite anode. Chlorine is formed at the anode, while sodium formed at the cathode dissolves into the mercury, making sodium amalgam. Normally this sodium amalgam is drawn off and reacted with water in a \\"decomposer cell\\" to produce hydrogen gas, concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, and mercury to be recycled through the process. In principle, all the mercury should be completely recycled, but inevitably a small portion goes missing. Because of concerns about this mercury escaping into the environment, the mercury cell process is generally being replaced by plants which use a less toxic cathode.

Straffen killed two young girls in the summer of 1951. He was found to be unfit to plead and committed to Broadmoor Hospital; during a brief escape in 1952, he killed again. This time, Straffen was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Reprieved because of his mental state, Straffen had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, and he remained in prison until his death more than 55 years later. Early life John Straffen's father, John Straffen Sr, was a soldier in the British Army. The younger Straffen was the third child in the family; his older sister was regarded as a \\"high grade mental defective\\" who died in 1952. Straffen was born at Bordon Camp in Hampshire where his father was then based. When Straffen was two years old, his father was posted abroad, and the family spent six years in India. Returning to Britain in March 1938, Straffen's father took a discharge from the Army, and the family settled in Bath. In October 1938, Straffen was referred to a child guidance clinic for stealing and truancy. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years probation. His probation officer found that Straffen did not understand the difference between right and wrong, or the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his I.Q. as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne. Two years later, Straffen moved to Besford Court, a senior school. He was noted as a solitary boy who took correction very badly. At 14 he was suspected of strangling two geese. At the age of 16, the school authorities undertook a review which found his I.Q. was 64 and his mental age was nine years six months, recommending his discharge. Criminal career Straffen returned home to Bath in March 1946, where the Medical Officer of Health examined him and found he still warranted certification under the Mental Deficiency Act. After several short-term jobs, he found a place as a machinist in a clothing factory. Early in 1947, Straffen began to go into unoccupied homes and steal small items to hide them; he never took them home or gave the items to others. Straffen had no friends and began stealing without being enticed by others. On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl reported to police that a boy called John had assaulted her by putting his hand over her mouth and saying, \\"What would you do if I killed you? I have done it before.\\" This incident was not connected to Straffen until later. Six weeks later, Straffen was found to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a girl with whom he had quarrelled. When arrested, Straffen was also under suspicion for burglary and, in his police interview, cheerfully confessed to it and many other incidents to which he had not been connected. He was remanded in custody and the Medical Officer of Horfield prison examined him, certifying that he was mentally retarded. On 10 October, Straffen was committed to Hortham Colony in Bristol under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.https://www.higgypop.com/urbex/hortham-hospital/ Hortham was an \\"open\\" colony which specialised in training mentally disabled offenders for resettlement in the community. As he had been under investigation for burglary, Straffen's certificate stated that he was \\"not of violent or dangerous propensities.\\" He was well-behaved at Hortham and kept away from other inmates. As a result, in July 1949, he was transferred to a lower- security agricultural hostel in Winchester. There he did well initially, but fell back into old ways when he stole a bag of walnuts and was sent back to Hortham in February 1950. In August 1950, Straffen got in trouble with Hortham authorities when he went home without leave and resisted the police when they went to recapture him. Mental health In 1951, Straffen was examined at a Bristol hospital, where electroencephalograph readings showed that he had suffered \\"wide and severe damage to the cerebral cortex, probably from an attack of encephalitis in India before the age of six.\\" By now, however, Straffen was considered sufficiently rehabilitated to be allowed a period of unescorted home leave. He used the time to get a job at a market garden, which he was allowed to keep. Hortham licensed him to the care of his mother, as the family home was less overcrowded. When Straffen's 21st birthday came, under the Mental Deficiency Act, he had to be reassessed by Hortham, which continued his certificate for a further five years; the family disputed the assessment and appealed. As a result, the Medical Officer of Health for Bath examined Straffen again on 10 July 1951 and found improvement in mental age to 10; he recommended that Straffen's certificate be renewed only for six months with a view to discharge at the end. Child killings According to Letitia Fairfield in the introduction to the Notable British Trials series volume about Straffen, he had a \\"smouldering hatred\\" and an \\"intense resentment\\" of the police and blamed them for all his troubles from the age of eight. On the morning of Straffen's assessment, a young girl named Christine Butcher was murdered. Fairfield speculates that Straffen saw the press coverage that followed and made the connection that strangling young girls gave the maximum amount of trouble to the police. On 15 July 1951, Straffen went to the cinema, on his own. His route took him past 1 Camden Crescent in Bath, where 5-year- old Brenda Goddard lived with her foster parents. According to Straffen's later statement to the police, he saw Brenda gathering flowers and offered to show her a better place. He lifted Brenda over a fence into a copse, after which she fell and hit her head on a stone. She was unconscious, and he strangled her. Straffen did not make any attempt to hide the body and simply went on to the cinema, watched the film Shockproof, and returned home. Although Bath police had not previously suspected Straffen was violent, he was considered a suspect in the murder and interviewed by police on 3 August.\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 124 (Evidence of Thomas James Coles). Meanwhile, the police had visited his employer to check on his movements; this resulted in Straffen being dismissed on 31 July.\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 10. In a later interview with a prison psychiatrist, Straffen said that he knew he was under suspicion and wanted to annoy the police, because he hated them for shadowing him.\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 168-169 (Evidence of Dr Alexander Leitch). On 8 August, Straffen was again at the cinema when he met 9-year-old Cicely Batstone. He first took Cicely to a different cinema to see another film and then went on the bus to a meadow known as \\"Tumps\\" on the outskirts of Bath. There he strangled her to death. The circumstances of the murder left many witnesses who had seen Straffen with the girl. The bus conductor recognised Straffen as a former workmate, a courting couple in the meadow had seen Straffen very closely, and a policeman's wife had also seen the two together. She mentioned it to her husband; when the alarm was raised the next morning, she guided police to where she had seen the two, and Cicely's body was discovered. Her description of the man was enough to identify Straffen immediately as the suspect. Arrest and conviction Accordingly, the police drove to Straffen's home and arrested him for the murder of Cicely on the morning of 9 August. Straffen made a statement admitting he had killed Cicely and also confessed to the murder of Brenda: \\"The other girl, I did her the same.\\"\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 132-133 (Evidence of Albert Foster; statement of John Thomas Straffen). He was charged with murder and remanded in custody.\\"Man Charged With Girl's Murder\\", The Times, 11 August 1951, p. 3. On 31 August, after a two-day hearing at Bath Magistrates' Court, a date was set for Straffen's trial for the murder of Brenda.\\"Alleged Murder Of Two Girls\\", The Times, 1 September 1951, p. 3. English law at the time did not permit an indictment for more than a single charge of murder. At Taunton Assize Court, on 17 October 1951, Straffen stood trial for murder before Mr Justice Oliver. However, the only witness to be heard was Peter Parkes, medical officer at Horfield Prison, who testified to Straffen's medical history and stated his conclusion that Straffen was unfit to plead. Oliver commented, \\"In this country we do not try people who are insane. You might as well try a baby in arms. If a man cannot understand what is going on, he cannot be tried.\\" The jury formally returned a verdict that Straffen was insane and unfit to plead.\\"Labourer Found Unfit To Plead\\", The Times, 18 October 1951, p. 3. Straffen was transferred to Broadmoor hospital in Berkshire. Broadmoor had originally been termed a criminal lunatic asylum, but by the Criminal Justice Act 1948, responsibility for it had been transferred to the Ministry of Health, and those committed to it had been renamed patients.\\"Report of the Broadmoor Enquiry Committee\\" (Cmd 8594), paragraph 4. In Broadmoor, Straffen was given a job as a cleaner. Escape from Broadmoor and murder of Linda Bowyer On 29 April 1952, Straffen went with an attendant and another patient to clean some outbuildings that were close to the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8¬Ω feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes. Only 20 minutes after escaping, Straffen came up a private drive in Crowthorne and approached Doris Spencer, who was in her garden. He asked her for a drink of water, which she gave him and then discussed the proximity of Broadmoor and the likelihood of escapes. He left after 10 minutes.\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 90 (Evidence of Mrs Doris Evelyn Spencer). An hour and a half later, he reached Farley Hill, and at about five o'clock, Straffen met 5-year-old Linda Bowyer was riding her bicycle around the village. Half an hour later, Bowyer was dead.\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 13-14. Straffen then begged a cup of tea from another householder, Mrs Kenyon, who agreed to drive him to a bus stop. As they were drawing up to the stop, Straffen saw some men in uniform and asked whether they were police; on learning that they were, he quickly got out of the car and ran. Kenyon told the men (who were actually Broadmoor nurses) of the suspicious behaviour of her passenger, and Straffen was caught a few minutes later. Driven in the car on the journey back to Broadmoor, Straffen said, \\"I have finished with crime.\\" Linda's body was found the next morning.\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), pp. 14-15. The police went to Broadmoor to interview Straffen at 8am, arriving before news of the disappearance and murder of a local child had reached the hospital. The police went to Straffen's room and woke him up, then asking him what he had done when he was free and whether he had got into mischief. Straffen replied, \\"I did not kill her.\\" The inspector told Straffen that no-one had suggested anyone had been killed, and Straffen said: \\"I know what you policemen are, I know I killed two little children but I did not kill the little girl.\\" The inspector then confirmed that a girl had been killed near where Straffen was recaptured. Straffen said, \\"I did not kill the little girl on the bicycle.\\" Straffen then made a long statement, which the police checked. On 1 May, Straffen was charged with the murder of Linda, and he appeared at Reading Magistrates' Court the following day. He was remanded in custody, and despite the fact of the order committing him to Broadmoor, the magistrates decided that, since they had failed to hold him, he should be sent to HMP Brixton. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health called for a full inquiry into how Straffen had escaped.\\"Inquiry Into Escape From Broadmoor\\", The Times, 1 May 1952, p. 6. A group of local residents held a meeting on the same evening as Straffen's court appearance to call for some system of public warning of an escape.\\"Protest Meeting Near Broadmoor\\", The Times, 3 May 1952, p. 6. The Ministry of Health inquiry was extended to a full independent inquiry.\\"Further Inquiry On Broadmoor\\", The Times, 7 May 1952, p. 6. A system of warning sirens was set up later in 1952 as a result of the inquiry recommendations.\\"Security Measures At Broadmoor\\", The Times, 17 October 1952, p. 6. Bowyer murder trial When Straffen's murder trial opened on 21 July, he pleaded not guilty, and the defence opted to leave the question of his sanity as an issue to be determined by the jury. After the prosecution case (led by the Solicitor- General, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller) had opened and called the first witnesses to establish the facts about the murder of Linda, they applied to call additional evidence about the two murders in Bath. This application was resisted by Straffen's defence as prejudicial, but the judge ruled the evidence admissible. On the second day, the judge was late into court and explained that \\"owing to the alleged conduct of one of your members,\\" he was compelled to discharge them and start again with a new jury. It turned out that one of the first set of jurors had gone to a political club in Southsea in the evening and told those present that he was on the jury for the Straffen case, that Straffen was not guilty, and that one of the prosecution witnesses had murdered Linda. The judge required the errant juror, William Gladwin, to remain in court throughout the trial, before calling him to apologise for his \\"wicked discharge of your duties as a citizen\\".\\"Straffen Guilty Of Murder\\", The Times, 26 July 1952. The first day's proceedings were repeated before the second jury, followed, as permitted, by evidence of what had happened in Bath. Straffen's defence called several of those who had seen Straffen in earlier years to give evidence of his mental condition. The prosecution then called prison medical officers and psychiatrists to give evidence in rebuttal. Dr. Thomas Munro, who was a specialist in mental deficiency and had seen Straffen, testified that he had said that to murder was wrong because it was breaking the law and because \\"it is one of the commandments\\". When Munro asked Straffen to name the other commandments, Straffen could remember only four.\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 204-205 (Evidence of Dr Thomas Arthur Howard Munro). After retiring for just under an hour, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty, which implicitly declared Straffen sane. Mr Justice Cassels sentenced Straffen to death.\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 263. Straffen appealed, on the grounds that the evidence about the Bath murders was wrongly admitted, and that his statements on the morning after the murder of Linda Bowyer were wrongly admitted because they had been made before he was cautioned. Both grounds of the appeal were dismissed,\\"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen\\", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD, and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 264-273. and Straffen was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.\\"Straffen Refused House of Lords Appeal\\", The Times, 27 August 1952, p. 4. 4 September was fixed as the date for execution of judgment of death.The Times, 28 August 1952, p. 2. However, on 29 August, it was announced that Home Secretary David Maxwell Fyfe had recommended to the Queen that Straffen be reprieved.\\"Reprieve Recommended for Straffen\\", The Times, 30 August 1952, p. 4. Reprieve and prison After his reprieve, Straffen was moved to Wandsworth Prison. In November 1952, the Home Office denied a rumour that he was about to be moved to the Rampton mental institution.\\"Straffen 'Unlikely to be Moved'\\", The Times, 3 November 1952, p. 4. In 1956, Straffen was moved to Horfield Prison after officers discovered an escape attempt by Wandsworth prisoners who intended to take Straffen with them as a diversion.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 20 April 1956, p. 4. The news caused extreme concern in Bristol, and a petition demanding his removal was organised by a local councillor and signed by 12,000 people within weeks.\\"Film Protests On Straffen Denied\\", The Times, 25 May 1956, p. 10. While in Horfield, Straffen was described by former politician Peter Baker, briefly a fellow prisoner, as always being conspicuous when he was exercising, being much taller than anyone else and wearing distinctive clothing for a special watch prisoner. Baker thought the \\"long, emaciated, miserable figure\\" looked \\"like a dying butterfly or a caged animal\\" and reported rumours that Straffen made application to the governor every month to see if a date had been set for his release.Peter Baker, \\"Time Out of Life\\", Heinemann, 1961, p. 188. In August 1958, Straffen was moved to Cardiff Prison when the regime at Horfield was changed to a more liberal one.\\"Straffen Transferred\\", The Times, 25 August 1958, p. 3. However, he was reported to have been transferred back in June 1960.\\"Straffen Transferred Report\\", The Times, 7 June 1960, p. 10. A new 28-cell high-security wing at Parkhurst Prison was built and ready for opening early in 1966. The Home Office pointedly did not deny rumours that Straffen had been secretly transferred there on 31 January 1966.\\"Straffen Transferred?\\", The Times, 2 February 1966, p. 12. He was the first to arrive, and was followed by six of the Great Train robbers.\\"Train Robbers Have A Car Each In Transfer\\", The Times, 5 February 1966, p. 8. In May 1968, Straffen was moved to Durham Prison.\\"Straffen moved\\", The Times, 23 May 1968, p. 1. Placed in the top security E wing, Straffen was joined by fellow child killer Ian Brady. Crime author Jonathan Goodman wrote that \\"the shambling lunatic [Straffen] .. is in prison only because no mental institution is secure enough to guarantee his confinement\\".\\"The Trial of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley\\", ed. by Jonathan Goodman (Celebrated Trials Series, David & Charles, 1973), p. 40. Many years later, a prison officer recalled seeing Straffen \\"circling, banging the fence every couple of minutes\\", and that one fellow officer described him as aloof and hostile: \\"Never talks unless he has to ask for something. Always on his own\\".Mitya Underwood, \\"Lifting the lid on my prison life\\", Evening Chronicle, 6 August 2007, p. 22. Straffen was still at Durham Prison in January 1984 when Kenneth Barlow was released after serving 26 years for murder, at which point he became the longest serving British prisoner.\\"Man to be freed after 26 years\\", The Times, 31 December 1983, p. 2. =Sentencing terms= For most of the time that Straffen was in prison, the Home Secretary had to agree to the release of any life sentence prisoner; no occupant of the office was ever willing to let Straffen out. In 1994, Michael Howard decided to compile a select list of about 20 prisoners serving life sentences who must never be released, and Straffen's name was said to be on it.Sunday Telegraph, 3 April 1994. The whole list was published by the News of the World in December 1997; this report confirmed that Straffen would spend the rest of his life in prison. In 2001, with the 50th anniversary of Straffen's imprisonment approaching, his solicitors called for his case to be reopened on the grounds that he had not been fit to stand trial.\\"Killer jail review\\", Birmingham Mail, 26 May 2001, p. 9. Investigative journalist Bob Woffinden, who examined previously confidential records, uncovered that Straffen had been reprieved after a majority of doctors who examined him found that he was insane.Bob Woffinden, \\"Historic murder case may reopen: Uncovered records could liberate UK's longest serving prisoner\\", The Guardian, 26 May 2001, p. 14. Woffinden also doubted Straffen's guilt in the murder of Linda, because Straffen had no fingernails with which to cause injuries seen on her body and because some local witnesses placed the time of the murder after his recapture.Bob Woffinden, \\"Insane, guilty or neither?\\", The Guardian Weekend Section, 26 May 2001, p. 34. However, Straffen's application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission was turned down in December 2002.\\"Child-Killer To Die In Prison\\", Western Daily Press, 3 December 2002. In May 2002, the European Court of Human Rights decided a case brought by a life sentence prisoner which challenged the authority of the Home Secretary to refuse to release him after the Parole Board recommended he be freed. The court decided that politicians should not interfere in life sentences and therefore current practice was unlawful. It was immediately noted that this meant an opportunity for release for Straffen,Dan McDougall, Arthur MacMillan, \\"Human Rights court rules government must not interfere in life sentences\\", Scotsman, 29 May 2002, p. 5. who had been in Long Lartin Prison since 2000. Death Straffen died at Frankland Prison in County Durham on 19 November 2007 at the age of 77. He had been in prison for a British record of 55 years. Ian Brady, who had been in prison since October 1965 and was then in Ashworth Hospital, became Britain's longest-serving prisoner until his own death ten years later.Yakub Qureshi, \\"Final farewell for Moors murder victim Keith Bennett\\", Manchester Evening News, 4 March 2010.

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the riding of Scarborough Centre in Toronto. He served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne. Background Duguid was born in Scarborough and graduated from Woburn Collegiate Institute and the University of Toronto. Before seeking elected office, Duguid worked in government services at the municipal, provincial and federal levels, serving as executive assistant to Metro Councillor Scott Cavalier, Ontario MPP Frank Faubert, and Liberal Members of Parliament Catherine Callbeck and Derek Lee. Politics =Municipal= In 1994, he was elected as a city councillor for the suburban municipality of Scarborough. In the elections of 1997 and 2000, he was elected as a councillor in the amalgamated \\"megacity\\" of Toronto. During his time in municipal government, Duguid was known for his work on community safety issues and affordable housing. He drafted a crime-prevention strategy for Toronto in 1999, and was a founder of the \\"Scarborough Community Safety Council\\", the \\"Scarborough Community Safety Audit Program\\" and the \\"Business Crime Prevention Seminar Program\\". He was also known as a supporter of then-Mayor of Toronto, Mel Lastman. In the 2003 election, Duguid supported John Tory over David Miller for Mayor of Toronto. =Provincial= On May 1, 2003, Duguid was appointed by Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty as the party's candidate for Scarborough Centre in the upcoming provincial election. This upset many in the local party association, as 1999 Ontario general election candidate Costas Manios was widely expected to win the nomination again. Manios decided to run against Duguid as an Independent (essentially campaigning as an \\"Independent Liberal\\"), and many believed he would deny Duguid victory by splitting the Liberal vote. Instead, the provincial trend overrode local factors‚ÄîDuguid defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Marilyn Mushinski by over 10,000 votes, while Manios finished fourth, behind Michael Laxer of the Ontario New Democratic Party. On October 23, 2003, Duguid was appointed Parliamentary Assistant on urban issues to John Gerretsen, the Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. As such, he has often clashed with Mayor David Miller over allegations by the mayor that the province has reneged on funding promises to the city. Following his re-election in 2007, Duguid was appointed Minister of Labour. He ensured job protection for military reservists and improved health and safety in the workplace. He also saw the creation of the new Family Day holiday, allowing Ontario families to spend quality time together. In a Cabinet shuffle on September 18, 2008, Duguid was appointed as the province's Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. As Minister of Aboriginal Affairs from 2008 to 2010, Duguid worked at building relationships through agreements with a number of First Nations and M√©tis organizations, including the framework to transfer Ipperwash Park to the Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation. Uniting two of his passions ‚Äì youth outreach and hockey ‚Äì Duguid also brought PLAY to First Nations' youth, a project that provides hockey coaching, mentoring and, potentially, facilities to Aboriginal communities in the north. On January 18, 2010 he was appointed Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. In the re-election and subsequent Cabinet shuffle, in October 2011, the Cabinet was dissolved, and the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure was split into two Ministries. The resulting cabinet Duguid was appointed as the Minister of Energy. In the Cabinet, post election, on October 20, 2011, Brad Duguid was appointed Minister of Economic Development and Innovation. In December 2012, CTV London reported that some of Minister Duguid's Christmas cards were sent without postage, instead using franking stickers only available to the monarch, federal MPs, senators and certain parliamentary employees. A staffer later resigned over the controversy. After Kathleen Wynne took over in 2013, she appointed Duguid as the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities. Duguid was re-elected in the June 2014 election. After the election he was appointed as the Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure. On June 13, 2016, Duguid's portfolio was changed to Minister of Economic Development and Growth. In September 2017, Duguid announced he would not be running for re-election in the next 2018 Ontario general election. His constituency was won by the Progressive Conservative candidate, Christina Mitas. =Cabinet positions= Electoral record References =Notes= =Citations= External links * Category:1962 births Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:People from Scarborough, Toronto Category:Toronto city councillors Category:University of Toronto alumni ","title":"Brad Duguid"},{"id":"1144869","text":"Autogenocide is the arbitrary or ideologically inspired mass murder of a country's citizens by its own ethnic group against its own ethnic group.MSN Encarta - Dictionary - autogenocide definition.

History NetNewsWire was developed by Brent and Sheila Simmons for their company Ranchero Software. It was introduced on July 12, 2002, with NetNewsWire Lite, a free version missing some advanced features of the (then commercial) version, introduced some weeks later. Version 1.0 was released on February 11, 2003, and version 2.0 was released in May 2005. At that time it included custom feed views, custom downloading and opening of podcasts, synchronization of feeds and feed status between computers, Bloglines support, and a built-in tabbed browser. In October 2005, NewsGator bought NetNewsWire, bringing their NewsGator Online RSS synchronization service to the Mac. Brent Simmons was hired by NewsGator to continue developing the software. NetNewsWire 3.0 was released on June 5, 2007. The version added Spotlight indexing of news items, integration with iCal, iPhoto, Address Book, and VoodooPad, Growl support, a new user interface, performance enhancements, and more. The application was originally shareware, but became free with the release of NetNewsWire 3.1 on January 10, 2008. NetNewsWire Lite was discontinued at the same time. NetNewsWire 3.2 moved to an advertisement-supported model, with an option to purchase the application to remove ads. An iOS version of NetNewsWire with support for the iPhone, iPod Touch and later for the iPad was released on the first day of the App Store. It included syncing of unread articles with the desktop version. NetNewsWire Lite 4.0 was introduced on March 3, 2011 on the Mac App Store. While it misses several of the advanced features included in NetNewsWire 3.2, it includes a completely rewritten code base. In the future, this will be used in the iOS versions of the app and for NetNewsWire 4.0 which will be shareware again. On June 3, 2011, the acquisition of NetNewsWire by Black Pixel was announced. For two years development had been apparently stalled, with a gap in updates from 2011 through the release of the version 4 Open Beta. On June 24, 2013, NetNewsWire 4.0 was announced and released as an open beta by Black Pixel. This announcement also brought news that the product would be a commercial product, with no free component (though the beta would be free to use through the final release). The final release of NetNewsWire 4.0 occurred on September 3, 2015.https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire/id635060292?mt=12 In 2017 support of JSON Feed was added into the code base. On August 31, 2018, Black Pixel announced that they have returned the NetNewsWire intellectual property to Brent Simmons. On September 1, 2018, Brent Simmons released NetNewsWire 5.0d1.

He is best known as the principal guitarist in Howlin' Wolf's band from 1948 to 1953. His raucous, distorted guitar playing is prominent on Howlin' Wolf's Memphis recordings during 1951‚Äì1953, including the hit song \\"How Many More Years\\" (recorded May 1951). In 2017, Johnson was posthumously inducted in to the Blues Hall of Fame. Life and career Willie Lee Johnson was born in Senatobia, Mississippi. As the guitarist in the first band led by Howlin' Wolf, he appeared on most of Wolf's recordings between 1951 and 1953. He provided the slightly jazzy yet raucous guitar sound that was the signature of all of Wolf's Memphis recordings. Johnson also performed and recorded with other blues artists in the Memphis area, including pianist Willie Love, Willie Nix, Junior Parker, Roscoe Gordon, Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland and others. When Wolf moved to Chicago in around 1953, he could not convince Johnson to join him. Johnson stayed on in Memphis for several years, playing on a number of sessions for Sun Records, including a 1955 collaboration with vocalist Sammy Lewis, \\"I Feel So Worried\\", released under the name Sammy Lewis with Willie Johnson. By the time Johnson relocated to Chicago, Wolf had already hired guitarist Hubert Sumlin as a permanent replacement. James Cotton later recalled that Wolf replaced Johnson because of his heavy drinking. Johnson occasionally performed and recorded with Howlin' Wolf after settling in Chicago, and also played briefly in the band of Muddy Waters, as well as a number of other local Chicago blues musicians, including J. T. Brown, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He made his living mainly outside of music for the rest of his life, only occasionally sitting in with the bands of his old friends around Chicago. His final recordings were made for Earwig Music in Chicago in the early 1990s. Johnson died in Chicago on February 26, 1995. Namesakes Willie Johnson the guitarist should not be confused with Willie Johnson (a member of the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet until joining the Jubilaires in 1948), or with Blind Willie Johnson, an earlier gospel artist.

He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2014, representing the downtown Toronto riding of Trinity-Spadina and before that the old riding of Fort York. Background Born in San Nicola da Crissa, Calabria, Marchese arrived in Canada with his family in 1961. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, French and Philosophy from the University of Toronto in 1978, and later received a Bachelor of Education degree. He taught English and French in Toronto and Mississauga. He is also fluent in Italian. As well, he served as Vice- President of the National Congress of Italian Canadians (Toronto), Toronto Public Library Board trustee, and Multilingual Literacy Centre Chair. Political life In 1980, he ran for school trustee in Ward 4 but finished third behind incumbents Patrick Case and Peter Davis. In 1982 he ran again this time being elected. He ran as a New Democrat aligned trustee. He served on the Toronto school board from 1982 to 1990. During this period, he was an advocate of lingual and racial rights, worked to establish international language programs, alternative schools and school childcare, and helped to end the practice of streaming students into narrow learning programs. In 1985 and again in 1988, Marchese voted with other trustees to raise their salaries 35% and 86% respectively. By the end of 1988 salaries had increased from about $18,000 to $44,000. Trustees who supported the increase argued that the salary was too low to attract good candidates. Sheila Cary-Meagher, said, \\"You have to stop and think... about the people who want to run for the job and who, if we keep it a rich person's ghetto, can't do it,\\" she said. In both years trustees rejected citizen recommendations for lower increases. =Provincial politics= In 1990, Marchese was elected to the Ontario parliament in the provincial election of 1990, defeating incumbent Liberal Bob Wong by about 1500 votes in the riding of Fort York. The NDP won a majority government and Marchese was appointed as the Minister of Culture and Communications on October 1, 1990. One of his first acts as minister was to announce the withdrawal of provincial funds for a proposed opera house in Toronto. Even though the province gave the land to the city for the opera house it was never built. He presided over a significant increase in funding to the Ontario Arts Council and the provincial film industry, but was dropped from cabinet on July 31, 1991. Critics argued that he was dropped from cabinet because he promoted multiculturalism at the expense of some mainstream arts groups. As a replacement for his cabinet position, Marchese was appointed as parliamentary assistant to Premier Bob Rae focusing on constitutional affairs. In this position he was a proponent of adding a 'social charter' to the Canadian constitution. This would have promoted equal opportunities, reduce disparities and maintain equalization payments. In June 1994, he introduced a private member's bill to give Toronto the ability to regulate after hours clubs. The party decided to take over the bill and expanded it to encompass the entire province. It was passed on November 24, 1994. =Cabinet positions= =In opposition= The NDP were defeated in the 1995 election, although Marchese managed to increase his margin of victory against Wong who ran again for the Liberals. In opposition, he managed to distinguish himself as one of the most spirited debaters in the reduced NDP caucus. In the 1999 provincial election he ran in the new riding of Trinity‚ÄîSpadina and easily won. He was re-elected in 2003, 2007 and 2011. During his tenure in opposition he served as critic for several portfolios and was NDP caucus chair from 2007 to 2014. In the 2014 provincial election, he was defeated by Liberal candidate Han Dong by 9,175 votes.

Highlights  The Museumsquartier contains Baroque buildings as well as Modern architecture by the architects Laurids and Manfred Ortner (Ortner & Ortner Baukunst). The renovation of the former court stables began in April 1998. Three years later, the Museumsquartier opened in two stages (June and September 2001). The total cost of the construction was 150 Million Euro (two billion Austria Schilling). The MQ is home to a range of installations from large art museums like the Leopold Museum and the MUMOK (Museum of Modern Art Ludwig Foundation Vienna) to contemporary exhibition spaces like the Kunsthalle Wien and festivals like the Wiener Festwochen, an annual summer event that is headquartered in the MuseumsQuartier Wien. Additional highlights include the Tanzquartier, an international, state-of-the-art centre for dance, the Architekturzentrum Wien, production studios for new media, artist studios for artists-in-residence, outstanding art and cultural facilities designed for children, and a variety of other events and festivals such as the renowned Viennale film festival, the ImPulsTanz Vienna International Dance Festival, Coded Cultures, Techno Sensual, and many others. The Museumsquartier hosts quartier21, which features around 60 alternative art groups, for example eSeL. Since 2002, an artist-in- residence programme brought over 735 artists to MuseumsQuartier, who have been working and living in the studio spaces. The residency programme is run together with tranzit.org / ERSTE Stiftung, the Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs and the Research Institute for Arts and Technology. The Museumsquartier station of line U2 of the Vienna U-Bahn, as well as the metro station \\"Volkstheater\\" is located next to the premises.  Controversy  There was negative media reaction after it became known that the expensive public buildings had serious shortcomings regarding barrier-free wheelchair accessibility. Not even the recently constructed buildings (Kunsthalle, MUMOK and Leopold Museum) were able to fulfill the most basic requirements. After many negative reports across the media, and the commitment of handicapped interest groups, the majority of the problems were repaired in the following years. Public Netbase, an internet provider and sponsor of electronic art and culture programs, was not invited to be part of Museumsquartier in 2002. Originally located in a part of the MQ, it had to leave during the renovations, but after the construction was completed, it was not able to return to its former premises.

Adler and Jason Maurer, written by Scott Biear, Patrick J. Cowan, Carl Dream and Jennifer A. Jones. It stars Freddie Prinze, Jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt, Anne Bancroft, Chris Kattan, Louis Gossett Jr., Val Kilmer and Malcolm McDowell with narration by Sally Kellerman. It was distributed by Freestyle Releasing with music by Geoff Zanelli and produced by Electric Eye Entertainment Corporation and Fathom Studios, a division of Macquarium Intelligent Communications, which began development of the project in 1999. Despite winning the Best Feature award at Anima Mundi, the film received largely negative reviews and its box office was one of the lowest-grossing wide releases in recent history. Delgo grossed under $1 million in theaters against an estimated budget of $40 million. The film was released independently with a large screen count (over 2,000 screens) and a small marketing budget. 20th Century Fox later acquired the film rights for international and DVD distribution. As a result, it became a box office bomb, losing an estimated $46 million. Delgo was the final film for actors Anne Bancroft and John Vernon, both of whom died three years before its release. The film is dedicated to Bancroft. Plot After having left their own world due to a loss of natural resources, the winged humanoid Nohrin settle on Jhamora with the permission of the ground-dwelling Lokni. Would-be conqueror Sedessa leads those Nohrin that believe in its own racial superiority and try to take land away from the Lokni. The parents of Delgo, a Lokni, are killed in the resulting conflict. Nohrin King Zahn is horrified by the war and admonishes Sedessa, who then poisons the Queen and almost kills Zahn (who catches her) as well. She is subsequently banished, and her wings are clipped off. Delgo, meanwhile, is raised by Elder Marley, who tries to teach him how to use the power of magical stones. Delgo grows up and he gives in to his desire for revenge against all Nohrin. He meets Nohrin Princess Kyla and develops a tentative friendship with her. When she is kidnapped by Nohrin General Raius, who is actually working for Sedessa, Delgo and his friend Filo are blamed and arrested. In the Nohrin prison, Delgo meets Nohrin General Bogardus, who was forced to illegally gamble with his weapons by Raius, because Bogardus opposed an all out war with the Lokni. Delgo, Filo, and Bogardus escape into some caverns and eventually reach Sedessa's stronghold and rescue Kyla. They return too late to avert a war taking place. Bogardus fights and defeats Raius, but he is mortally injured. Just as Bogardus dies from heavy wounds, Delgo realizes that he was the Nohrin soldier who spared his life many years ago during the first war between the Nohrin and the Lokni. Meanwhile, Sedessa's army of monsters join in the battle. Kyla convinces the Nohrin generals to direct their troops to stop fighting the Lokni and instead pick them up and fly them away from the battlefield. Filo then directs an entire stampede of large animals onto the battlefield, sending Sedessa's minions fleeing for their lives. Delgo goes off to face Sedessa and find King Zahn, whom she has taken prisoner. He finally manages to master the stone magic, and defeats Sedessa. He also puts the past behind him by saving her rather than letting her fall to her death. However, Sedessa then attacks Kyla, who has come to Delgo's aid. The two struggle and Sedessa finally falls, injuring herself by the fall and her artificial wings being of no use. Later, during the celebrations, it turns out Raius was not dead, and he makes one last attempt to kill Delgo. He is subdued by a Nohrin, but not before he throws his spear at Delgo. Then, out of nowhere, the spear breaks in mid-air. Everyone turns to look at Filo, who has finally mastered his slingshot. Later, Delgo and Kyla's friendship blossoms into romance when they finally kiss.

Adler as the Soldiers * Sally Kellerman as the Narrator Production Fathom Studios began development on Delgo in 1999; animation work began in 2001. The movie was produced by Fathom in conjunction with Electric Eye Entertainment Corporation. In a 2001 interview, Marc Adler said that the film sets itself apart from other recent computer-animated films because it is not a comedy and also because it is \\"a very human story told in a non-human world\\". Maurer said that \\"the inspiration for the story really came from all of unrest we have in society today, prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes, violence ‚Äì all of those terrible things. We wanted to tell a story where our heroes overcame these things personally and facilitated change among entire peoples.\\" Fathom launched a \\"Digital Dailies\\" feature on the movie's official website, allowing fans to follow the production as it happened. Animators would post their work daily on the message board system and fans could see the directors' and producers' input as well as subsequent changes to the scenes. Chief Animator and Artistic Director Derek Winslow went on record in the January 2001 issue of US weekly, stating that \\"Delgo would be his finest creation\\" and \\"would outperform Shrek at the box office\\". According to Adler, although the original intent of the dailies was to allow the crew to \\"be able to offer commentary to other staff members who do not work the same hours\\", he also said that offering a learning experience to the public was an important reason for their creation. \\"By granting public access to our film as a work-in-process we are helping to educate students, burgeoning animators, and film enthusiasts about the procedures involved in the making of a computer animated movie.\\" Adler said that they were \\"contacted by professors from the many universities who use the Digital Dailies in their classrooms\\". The dailies \\"were receiving a half-million hits a month\\", and some of the crew members started to get offers from Hollywood studios (at one point Adler started hiding the identities of the crew with fancy aliases). Adler recruited main crew members locally from \\"Savannah College of Art and Design, Georgia Tech and smaller digital outfits\\". Students from the drama department of North Atlanta High School acted out some of the scenes to create reference material for the animators. Adler said that their team created eight main characters, at least twenty \\"secondary characters\\", \\"twenty-two creatures, thirty plants, and fifty-six sets\\", as well as numerous background characters. According to Warren Grubb, Fathom's head animation director, one of the challenges with modeling the background elements was that \\"We couldn't even use most of the off-the-shelf systems at the time in creating the background assets because they were based on Earthly vegetation.\\" The filmmakers put together kits with artwork and actual replicas of the stones used in the film to send to the actors, rather than just an offer letter. Once the cast had signed on, the filmmakers had to travel to where the actors were with all their equipment rather than have the actors come to them to record their voices. Anne Bancroft, the voice of villainess Sedessa, died in 2005, before production finished. On the film's end credits, the film is dedicated to her. Aside from the death of Bancroft, the film had several other setbacks which delayed its release. John Vernon, the voice of Judge Nohrin, also died in 2005, making this his final film. The directors acknowledge the influence of artist Roger Dean, specifically his album covers for Yes and Asia, on their backgrounds.DVD commentary track. A partnership with Dell provided Fathom Studios with the hardware required to render Delgo. Distribution Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was originally expected to release the picture but an executive restructuring altered these plans. In addition, Kevin Foster, the president of Fathom Studios' parent company Macquarium, died of heart failure during production, causing attention to be drawn away from the film for almost a year. Distributor-for-hire Freestyle Releasing distributed the film in 2,160 screens in the United States. Reception =Box office= Delgo is notable for producing, at the time, the worst opening ever for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters, earning $511,920 at 2,160 sites. According to Yahoo! Movies, this averages approximately 2 viewers per screening. In 2012, another Freestyle Releasing film, The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure became the new holder of this record, earning only $443,901 on its opening weekend. Delgo is also the lowest-grossing computer-animated film of all time, with just $915,840 made worldwide, a record formerly held by the 2006 film Doogal ($7.2 million in the United States). =Critical response= Rotten Tomatoes reports that only 12% of critics gave positive reviews, based on 43 reviews, with an average score of 3.6/10, with the site's consensus stating that \\"Delgo features a blend of plot elements from earlier (and superior) fantasy films, with weaker animation and dull characters.\\" Metacritic, based on a normalized rating from 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 27/100, indicating \\"generally unfavorable\\". Leonard Maltin's publication \\"TV Movies\\" gives the film a BOMB rating, calling it \\"a complete misfire.\\" Critics from Newsday and Campus CircleKoslow, Jessica (2008-12-10). \\"film notes ‚Äì reviews: Delgo\\". Campus Circle. gave the film acclaim, citing a unique look and it was widely accepted by parents for its positive influences. Universally, Academy Award-winner Anne Bancroft was commended for her performance as the antagonist in what became her final film role. Tom Keogh of The Seattle Times praised Bancroft's \\"excellent voice work\\" and noted the film was a \\"busy but decent animated fable that feels like a Star Wars or Lord of the Rings spin-off\\". =Awards= The film was accepted by numerous film festivals, including the three largest animation festivals in the world: SICAF (Korea), Annecy (France), and Anima Mundi (Brazil). Delgo received the \\"Best Feature Film\\" award at 2008's Anima Mundi. Home media 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released Delgo on DVD on August 4, 2009. A Blu-ray Disc was released on October 5, 2010. The DVD extras include an audio commentary from the directors, featurettes, six deleted scenes, and the short \\"Chroma Chameleon\\".

He was the paternal grandfather of Diana, Princess of Wales. Early life Lord Spencer was born in London, the son of Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer, and his wife, the former Margaret Baring, second daughter of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke. His godparents included King Edward VII. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a friend of Lionel Lupton, who studied the same subject at Trinity.

He was made a knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem on 1 July 1955. Lord Spencer was active in the local politics of Northamptonshire as a Conservative councillor. He opened his ancestral home, Althorp, to the public and was a well-known art connoisseur, being a trustee of the Wallace Collection and chairman of the Royal School of Needlework. He was a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Arts, and for eight years in the 1960s he was Chair of the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. He was Chairman of the Governors at Wellingborough School from 1946 to 1972. Personal life Lord Spencer married Lady Cynthia Hamilton, second daughter of the 3rd Duke of Abercorn, on 26 February 1919 at St. James's Church in Piccadilly, London and they had two children: *Lady Anne Spencer (4 August 1920 ‚Äì 24 February 2020) married in 1944 to Captain Christopher Wake-Walker (1920‚Äì1998), son of Admiral Sir Frederic Wake-Walker, had issue. *John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (24 January 1924 ‚Äì 29 March 1992). Lord Spencer died at St Matthews Nursing Home, Northampton, after a short illness, and was succeeded by his son, John, the father of Diana, Princess of Wales.

Woodhead is an entrepreneur, software engineer and former game programmer. He claims that a common thread in his career is \\"doing weird things with computers\\".  Programming career  Along with Andrew C. Greenberg, he created the Apple II game Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, one of the first role-playing video games written for a personal computer, as well as several of its sequels. Woodhead designed the 1982 Apple II arcade game Star Maze, which was programmed by Gordon Eastman and sold through Sir-Tech. He told TODAY magazine in 1983, \\"I have loads of arcade game ideas, but lack the patience to do the actual coding. I'm sort of a big project person; I like the challenge of a program like Wizardry.\\" Later, he authored Interferon and Virex, two of the earliest anti-virus applications for the Macintosh, and co-founded AnimEigo, one of the first US anime releasing companies. As a result of this venture, while living in Japan, he married his translator and interpreter, Natsumi Ueki, together with whom he has two children. He also runs a search engine promotion website called SelfPromotion.com. As a hobby, he builds combat robots, and his children, James Ueki and Alex Ueki, are the 2004 and 2005 Robot Fighting League National Champions in the 30 lb Featherweight class. Woodhead made a cameo appearance in the 1982 video game Ultima II as an NPC; when the player talked to him he would scream \\"Copy Protect!\\", a sarcastic reference to the extensive copy protection methods used in video games of the time. He also has a screen credit in the film Real Genius as their \\"Hacking Consultant\\". Woodhead has created two successful Kickstarter projects, \\"Bubblegum Crisis Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray Set\\" ($153,964 pledged on a $75,000 goal), and \\"BackerSupport\\" ($326 pledged on a $100 goal).

MUC16 is a member of the mucin family glycoproteins. CA-125 has found application as a tumor marker or biomarker that may be elevated in the blood of some patients with specific types of cancers, or other conditions that are benign.  Structure  Mucin 16 is a membrane associated mucin that possesses a single transmembrane domain. A unique property of MUC16 is its large size. MUC16 is more than twice as long as MUC1 and MUC4 and contains about 22,000 amino acids, making it the largest membrane-associated mucin. MUC16 is composed of three different domains: * An N-terminal domain * A tandem repeat domain * A C-terminal domain The N-terminal and tandem repeat domains are both entirely extracellular and highly O-glycosylated. All mucins contain a tandem repeat domain that has repeating amino acid sequences high in serine, threonine and proline. The C-terminal domain contains multiple extracellular SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin) modules, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular region of MUC16 can be released from the cell surface by undergoing proteolytic cleavage. MUC16 is thought to be cleaved at a site in the SEA modules.  Function  MUC16 is a component of the ocular surface (including the cornea and conjunctiva), the respiratory tract and the female reproductive tract epithelia. Since MUC16 is highly glycosylated it creates a hydrophilic environment that acts as a lubricating barrier against foreign particles and infectious agents on the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Also, the cytoplasmic tail of MUC16 has been shown to interact with cytoskeleton by binding members of the ERM protein family. The expression of mucin 16 has been shown to be altered in dry eye, cystic fibrosis, and several types of cancers. Role in cancer Tumor metastasis initiated by interactions between MUC16 and mesothelin. MUC16 (CA-125) has been shown to play a role in advancing tumorigenesis and tumor proliferation by several different mechanisms. = As a biomarker = Testing of CA-125 blood levels has been proposed as useful in treating ovarian cancer. While the test can give useful information for women already known to have ovarian cancer, CA-125 testing has not been found useful as a screening method because of the uncertain correlation between CA-125 levels and cancer. =Metastatic invasion= Interaction of MUC16 (CA125) and mesothelin MUC16 is also thought to participate in cell-to-cell interactions that enable the metastasis of tumor cells. This is supported by evidence showing that MUC16 binds selectively to mesothelin, a glycoprotein normally expressed by the mesothelial cells of the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity). MUC16 and mesothelin interactions are thought to provide the first step in tumor cell invasion of the peritoneum. The region (residues 296-359) consisting of 64 amino acids at the N-terminus of cell surface mesothelin has been experimentally established as the functional binding domain (named IAB) for MUC16/CA125. An immunoadhesin (HN125) that consists of the IAB domain of mesothelin and the human Fc portion has the ability to disrupt the heterotypic cancer cell adhesion mediated by the MUC16-mesothelin interaction. Mesothelin has also been found to be expressed in several types of cancers including mesothelioma, ovarian cancer and squamous cell carcinoma. Since mesothelin is also expressed by tumor cells, MUC16 and mesothelial interactions may aid in the gathering of other tumor cells to the location of a metastasis, thus increasing the size of the metastasis. =Induced motility= Evidence suggests that expression of the cytoplasmic tail of MUC16 enables tumor cells to grow, promotes cell motility and may facilitate invasion. This appears to be due to the ability of the C-terminal domain of MUC16 to facilitate signaling that leads to a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and increase the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, which are expression patterns consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. =Chemotherapy resistance= MUC16 may also play a role in reducing the sensitivity of cancer cells to drug therapy. For example, overexpression of MUC16 has been shown to protect cells from the effects of genotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin.  Discovery  CA-125 was initially detected using the murine monoclonal antibody designated OC125. Robert Bast, Robert Knapp and their research team first isolated this monoclonal antibody in 1981. The protein was named ‚Äúcancer antigen 125‚Äù because OC125 was the 125th antibody produced against the ovarian cancer cell line that was being studied.

The Collegium Trilingue, often also called Collegium trium linguarum, or, after its creator Collegium Buslidianum (French: Coll√®ge des Trois Langues, Dutch: Dry Tonghen), was founded in 1517 under the patronage of the humanist, Hieronymus van Busleyden (in Latin Hieronymus Buslidius). History The College, in fact inspired by Erasmus who was a friend of Busleyden, was inaugurated in September 1518. It was not formally part of the University of Leuven, but had been founded by a group of humanists who wanted to spread humanism and the revival of the classics (specifically the literae humaniores), which were not popular at the time at the medieval University of Leuven. They promoted the teaching of the three ancient languages: Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

All people on-board the Deutschland survived the attack, though two accompanying vessels sank with great loss of life. Commissioning One of a group of four ships that included the SS Albert Ballin, SS Hamburg, and SS New York, the Deutschland was launched on 28 April 1923. She began her maiden voyage on 27 March 1924, to Southampton and then on to New York City. The turbine-powered ship had a speed of 14.5 knots; she was later re-engined with larger-geared turbines in 1929, with service speed increased to 19 knots. This gave the ship a seven-day passage across the Atlantic. On 11 November 1933, Deutschland collided with the American cargo ship in New York Harbor. Munargo suffered severe damage and was beached north of Bedloe's Island, but was refloated on 18 November 1933.

Sinking In April 1945, she began being converted into a hospital ship. An attempt was made to paint the vessel white, but there was only sufficient paint available to paint her funnels white, and to paint a Red Cross on one side of one of her funnels.

Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the \\"Model 1\\". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience. The original arcade game has three levels, designated into difficulties. Beginner is \\"Big Forest\\", intermediate is \\"Bay Bridge\\" and expert is \\"Acropolis\\". Each level has its own special feature, for example the amusement park in \\"Big Forest\\", or the \\"Bay Bridge\\" itself, or the tight hairpin of \\"Acropolis\\". When selecting a car, the player can choose different transmission types. VR introduced the \\"V.R. View System\\" by allowing the player to choose one of four views to play the game. This feature was then used in most other Sega arcade racing games (and is mentioned as a feature in the attract mode of games such as Daytona USA). It was later ported to home consoles, starting with the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994. Arcade cabinet versions Screenshot, arcade version V.R. was released in a \\"twin\\" cabinet ‚Äì the standard and most common version, which is effectively 2 complete machines built into a single cabinet. The Twin cabinets for the U.S. were manufactured by contract at Grand Products, Inc. in Illinois for Sega and were built using Wells-Gardner 25\\" monitors, nearly all of which had Zenith picture tubes with a manufacturing defect that caused them to fail after a few years of use. As a result of this, many V.R. machines were parted or thrown out and are an uncommon sight today. The Twin cabinet that was sold in the rest of the world was built by Sega in Japan and used 29\\" Nanao monitors. Twin cabinet, Twin Sit-down Model Also available was an upright (UR), which was a single- player cabinet using the same force-feedback steering as the twin. There was also a Deluxe version, known as the V.R. DX cabinet type, which is also a single-player machine and has a 16:9 aspect-ratio Hantarex monitor (the first use of a widescreen aspect ratio monitor in an arcade game), and 6 airbags (3 on each side) built into the seat that will inflate and \\"nudge\\" the player when cornering, and one more airbag on the player's back that inflates under braking. The seat is also adjustable via \\"forward\\" and \\"back\\" buttons using air pressure. V.R. DX's force-feedback steering also uses two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the steering wheel, which differ from the electric motor- and-clutch system that the upright and twin versions use (which have no inbuilt air system), so the steering feel is quite different. Luxor Casino, Las Vegas, USA, in 1993. Virtua Formula was released in 1993. It was unveiled at the opening of Sega's second arcade amusement park Joypolis, where a whole room with 32 machines was dedicated to the game. Virtua Formula was effectively a \\"super DX\\" version of V.R. and the player sat in a full-motion hydraulically actuated Formula One car 'replica' in front of a 50-inch screen. Most of these units were converted into Sega's second-generation Indy car simulator, Indy 500, and are commonly found at larger Sega Gameworks locations in the U.S. All versions of Virtua Racing are linkable up to 8-players; meaning 4 twin units or 8 DX, UR, or Virtua Formula cabinets can be linked together using fiber-optic cables. In addition to this, there was an optional display known as the Live Monitor that would sit atop the twin cabinets and replay action shots of what was occurring with actual players in a \\"virtual sportscast\\" by a virtual commentator, \\"Virt McPolygon\\". There is only one track. Home console versions =Sega Mega Drive/Genesis= Due to the complexity of the Model 1 board, a home console version seemed unlikely, until 1994 when a cartridge design incorporating the Sega Virtua Processor (SVP) on an extra chip was created to enable a version on the Genesis/Mega Drive. This chip was extremely expensive to manufacture, leading Sega to price the Genesis version of Virtua Racing unusually high: US$100 in the United States and ¬£70 in the United Kingdom. The game renders 9,000 polygons per second with the SVP chip, significantly higher than what the standard Genesis/Mega Drive hardware is capable of.Virtua Racing, IGN The game was incompatible with Majesco Entertainment's re-released Genesis 3 from 1998, and would not work on any Genesis equipped with a Sega 32X. =32X= The Sega 32X version, also known as Virtua Racing Deluxe, was released in 1994, developed by Sega AM2, and published by Sega under the Sega Sports label. It performed much more closely to the original arcade and included two extra cars (\\"Stock\\" and \\"Prototype\\") as well as two new tracks (\\"Highland\\" and \\"Sand Park\\"). =Sega Saturn= The Sega Saturn version, previously known by the working title Virtua Racing Saturn, was released in 1995 and developed and published by Time Warner Interactive. The Saturn release has the game soundtrack as standard Red Book audio, which can be listened to in any CD player. The Saturn version also includes seven new courses and four new cars. Unlike other versions, it features Grand Prix mode, where players drive a series of cars and the tracks to earn points. =PlayStation 2= A remake, called Virtua Racing: FlatOut, was released for the PlayStation 2 under the Sega Ages 2500 label. It was released in Japan in 2004 and in North America and Europe in 2005 as part of the Sega Classics Collection. It includes three new courses and four new cars. =Nintendo Switch= As part of the Sega Ages series, a port of Virtua Racing for the Nintendo Switch was released digitally in Japan on April 24, 2019 and elsewhere on June 27, 2019. Developed by M2, it is a port of the original arcade version with the frame rate increased to 60fps and presented in the 16:9 aspect ratio. Also new to this port is the ability to play online with up to 2 players offline and up to 8 players on a single system. The game also features online leaderboards with downloadable replays for the top 50 players on each track, an additional easier steering option and a Grand Prix mode that increases the number of laps to 20. Virt McPolygon also cameos in the game upon replaying a Grand Prix race.SEGA AGES Virtua Racing Review Reception The arcade version was well received upon release.

They called it \\"one of the most realistic racing games ever\\" and concluded that it leaves \\"all other racing games eating its technological dust\\". Computer and Video Games reviewed Virtua Formula in early 1994, stating that it is \\"one of the most exciting\\" arcade driving games and praising the \\"hydraulic control\\" of the cabinet. They concluded that, while its graphics are not as \\"drop-dead stunning\\" as the more recent Ridge Racer, Virtua Racing still has a greater \\"heart-pumping sense of speed.\\" GamePro named the Genesis/Mega Drive version the best Genesis game shown at the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show, commenting, \\"While obviously a great deal of graphic clarity, detail, and color was lost, the game play is stunningly faithful to the coin-op. ... this is the best version [of Virtua Racing] you'll see until Sega's mystery 32-bit home system leaves orbit.\\" In their later review, they complimented the game on its inclusion of all the elements of the arcade version aside from the support for up to eight players, and remarked that though the graphics are not as good as the arcade version, they feature faster-moving polygons than any other cartridge game. They criticized the audio and low longevity but nonetheless concluded \\"VR is the best 16-bit racer yet.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly scored it 31 out of 40 (average 7.75 out of 10). Like GamePro, they criticized the audio but held that the game, though not as good as the arcade version, was the best racer yet seen on cartridge-based systems. Famitsu magazine scored the Mega Drive version of the game 33 out of 40, calling it a \\"groundbreaking\\" port; later in September 1994, their Reader Cross Review gave it an 8 out of 10.Ë™≠ËÄÖ „ÇØ„É≠„Çπ„É¨„Éì„É•„Éº: V.R.(„Éê„Éº„ÉÅ„É£„É¨„Éº„Ç∑„É≥„Ç∞).

They also praised the improved graphics, details, and controls, and the retention of on-the-fly view switching even in two-player split-screen mode. Next Generation reviewed the 32X version of the game, Virtua Racing Deluxe, and stated that \\"VR Deluxe is a near-perfect conversion of a game that's still fun to play.\\" The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Saturn version scores of 8 and 7 out of 10, with the first reviewer praising the added content and overall improvement over the previous home ports, and the second reviewer saying that the game is enjoyable but doesn't fully use the graphical capabilities of the Saturn. GamePro similarly remarked \\"This version not only looks better than both the Genesis and 32X versions, it also has a ton more options.\\" They remarked that the graphics are not as good as Daytona USA, but that the game has better music and is more fun to play. A reviewer for Next Generation felt that Virtua Racing was antiquated by this time, particularly with the imminent release of Sega Rally Championship on the Saturn. However, he acknowledged that the game had enough historical impact to draw its share of loyalists, and said the Saturn version \\"is not only arcade-perfect, it also contains crucial features not present in the original.\\" Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine praised the additional tracks and cars as giving the game more depth than an arcade racer, but countered that what most gamers wanted was a straight conversion of the coin-op Virtua Racing, not a home-oriented remake. He concluded that the Saturn version is good on its own terms, but completely overshadowed by the Saturn conversion of Sega Rally Championship, which was to be released just a few weeks after. Maximum made the same comments but were more vehement in their criticism of the fact that the Saturn version is not a straight conversion of the arcade game. In 1994, it appeared at 4th place on Megas list of Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega, issue 26 (November 1994), page 74 In 1996, the arcade, 32X, and Saturn versions (but not the Genesis version) appeared at 11th place on Next Generations list of Top 100 Games of All Time.

According to Luke Reilly, while Winning Run was the first racing game with 3D polygons, Virtua Racings \\"bleeding-edge 3D models, complex backdrops, and blistering framerate were unlike anything we‚Äôd ever seen.\\" He added that it \\"allowed us to toggle between four different views, including chase cam and first-person view\\" which is \\"hard to imagine a modern racing game without\\" and said it \\"showed the masses what the future of racing games was going to look like\\".http://ign.com/articles/2015/04/03/the-top-10-most- influential-racing-games-ever?page=2 References Category:1992 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Head-to-head arcade games Category:Racing video games Category:Sega 32X games Category:Sega-AM2 games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Sega Games franchises Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Time Warner Interactive games Category:Video games designed by Yu Suzuki Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi ","title":"Virtua Racing"},{"id":"1145010","text":"Jonathan Michael Borwein (20 May 1951 - 2 August 2016)Math Drudge obituary was a Scottish mathematician who held an appointment as Laureate Professor of mathematics at the University of Newcastle, Australia.

Life Mary Ella Williams was born in Port Burwell, Ontario on 13 January 1857. She studied art at the Western School of Art and Design in London, Ontario. In 1886 she went to New York City to further her training at the Art Students League, followed by time in Paris, France at the artist's workshop run by Rapha√´l Collin (1850‚Äì1916) and Luc-Olivier Merson (1846‚Äì1920). In 1886, Dignam founded the Women's Art Club, which later evolved into the WAAC. During her presidency (1887-1913, 1935-1938), Dignam was the driving force behind production of the Cabot Commemorative State Dinner Service. This was a hand- painted eight-course, 24-place dinner set representing Canadian subjects that had been made by WAAC members to commemorate the 400th anniversary of John Cabot's discovery of Canada. Following her return to Canada in 1891, she taught at a ladies' art school in Toronto, Ontario and later organized the first Art Studios of Moulton Ladies' College at McMaster University. In 1898, Dignam and Lady Edgar, wife of the Speaker of the House of Commons, arranged for members of the House and Senate to subscribe $1,000 to purchase the service, which was formally presented to Lady Aberdeen on the occasion of her husband finishing his assignment as Governor General of Canada. She later helped organize the International Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and in 1900, founded the first all-women international art exhibition calling on Women's Art Association members & Women's International Art.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department. Geography The river Vend√©e flows through the town. The town has an area of . History Fontenay was in existence as early as the time of the Gauls. The affix of comte is said to have been applied to it when it was taken by King Louis IX from the family of Lusignan and given to his brother Alphonse, count of Poitou, under whom it became capital of Bas-Poitou. Ceded to the Plantagenets by the Treaty of Br√©tigny, in 1360 it was retaken in 1372 by Duguesclin. It suffered repeated capture during the Religious Wars of the 16th century, was dismantled in 1621 and was occupied both by the Republicans and the Royalist Vendeans during the Revolt in the Vend√©e (1793). From 1790 to 1806 it was capital of the Vend√©e department. Miscellaneous At Maison Laval on rue Rabelais, a townhouse built at the end of the 18th Century, Emperor Napoleon 1st and his wife, Jos√©phine, spent the night of 7‚Äì8 August 1808. On their way from Rochefort to Nantes, they had stopped off in the Bas- Poitou capital of Fontenay-le-Comte where they were the guests of Mayor Laval who, to give them a dignified welcome, had prepared a triumphal arch over the Pont Neuf bridge. That night, the Emperor learned of the defeat of General Dupont at Bailem.

Ross Bay Cemetery is located at 1516 Fairfield Road in Victoria, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island, Canada. Many historical figures from the early days of the province and colony of British Columbia are buried at Ross Bay. History The cemetery was opened in 1873. The 27.5 acre (111,000 m¬≤) cemetery is part of a public park and its south side faces Ross Bay on the Pacific Ocean. It is named after its owner, Isabella Mainville Ross, the first registered independent woman landowner in British Columbia. Isabella was also Indigenous, an Anishinaabe and French M√©tis woman, which makes her accomplishment even more remarkable. Her M√©tis son, Alexander Ross, was buried in the cemetery in 1876. His grave marker is the only known original marker left in possession of the Old Cemeteries Society. The old wooden marker is still used as a model for heritage markers. Isabella Ross was buried across the path from Alexander in 1885. In 1994, the Old Cemeteries Society marked Isabella's grave with a heritage marker, styled after the one she chose for Alexander. In 1911, a sea wall had to be constructed because of the severe erosion that occurred as a result of the relentless pounding of the ocean's waves. During the 1930s, the City began planting a large number of trees and today the cemetery is quite different from the original that was mainly barren ground. The Victorian-style Ross Bay Cemetery, contains numerous elaborate mausoleums and tall pillars from the early elite. Because the city of Victoria is the capital of the province of British Columbia, until the second quarter of the 20th century when improved ferry service and air travel made mobility to and from the island much easier, most senior politicians made Victoria their permanent home. As such, Ross Bay Cemetery is the burial site for many of the province's premiers. Although the Ross Bay Cemetery had long been considered full, the City of Victoria discovered approximately 270 unused plots in the cemetery in the late 1990s. Through a lottery process the City of Victoria sold seven of these plots in April 2004, and an additional 65 plots in February 2007. The money raised through the plot sales was used to fund refurbishment work at the Ross Bay Cemetery.

Debuting in the Bronze Age of Comic Books, the character was initially intended to be a surprise; an apparent monster who unexpectedly turns out to be a great hero. As such, Bill is the first being outside the Marvel Universe's Norse pantheon to be introduced as being worthy to wield Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. After an initial rivalry for possession of the weapon, the alien warrior was granted a war hammer of his own, called Stormbreaker, and the two reconciled as staunch allies, going on to fight side by side. Beta Ray Bill has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products, such as animated television series, video games, and merchandise. Publication history Beta Ray Bill debuted in The Mighty Thor #337 (November 1983), being established as an alien of the Korbinite race. Bill was created by Walt Simonson as a new concept for the title Thor. Simonson said, During a \\"Thor Spotlight\\" panel at the Baltimore Comic Con, August 28, 2010, Simonson further stated: The character's introduction continued in Thor vol. 1 #338‚Äì340. He continued to make appearances in Thor sporadically. He appeared in the \\"Maximum Security\\" crossover in January 2001 and the Secret Invasion crossover in 2008. He starred in the six-issue miniseries Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill and its two follow-ups, the one-shot Beta Ray Bill: The Green of Eden and three-issue Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter. Fictional character biography =1980s= Spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D. detected an alien fleet passing through Earth's galaxy, with Director Nick Fury asking Thor to investigate. When Thor finds the advance ship, it scans Thor and perceives him to be a threat. Unable to stop Thor, the sentient ship‚Äîcalled Skuttlebutt‚Äîrevives Beta Ray Bill, who is in suspended animation. Bill battles Thor to a standstill, until the ship reaches the Solar system, where one of the mystical enchantments of Thor's hammer Mjolnir comes into effect, which means that Thor will revert to his mortal persona of Donald Blake if separated from the hammer for more than 60 seconds. When that happens, Blake is knocked unconscious by Bill, who examines Blake's cane (Mjolnir's \\"shell\\" when Thor is in Blake's form) and on striking the cane receives Thor's power and a variant of his costume. Once Skuttlebutt arrives on Earth, Bill easily defeats an approaching S.H.I.E.L.D. team and is then transported to Asgard by the King of the Norse gods, Odin, who mistakes Bill for Thor. After some initial confusion, Odin returns Thor to Asgard, and Bill's origin is revealed. Bill's race, the Korbinites, were almost rendered extinct when their galaxy exploded. The remnants of the Korbinite race fled in a fleet of warships, guarded by a sentient ship called Skuttlebutt and a dedicated champion, Beta Ray Bill. Via Korbinite science, Bill was physically augmented and given the attributes of an indigenous wild beast (a process that killed all of Bill's predecessors). Skuttlebutt attacked Thor because the ship recognized the Asgardian magic as similar to that of the previous global threat, and assumed the Korbinites were being threatened once again. On discovering that Bill was worthy enough to lift Mjolnir, Odin proposes a battle to the death in the fiery Asgardian realm of Skartheim to decide who will wield the hammer. Bill and Thor render each other unconscious. Bill's resistance to heat allows him to recover first, however, and he is deemed the winner‚Äîbut he also saves Thor from falling into lava, believing he is too worthy an opponent to die, but he feels he needs the hammer to protect his people. After Bill reconsiders his claim to the hammer, Odin orders the making of a new hammer for Bill: Stormbreaker, equal in power to Mjolnir and created from the same metal and by the same dwarfs led by Eitri. Odin also transfers an enchantment from Mjolnir to Stormbreaker, so that Bill can return to his original Korbinite form by striking Stormbreaker upon the ground‚Äîand Thor can no longer become Donald Blake. After learning that the mishap that killed most of Bill's people was caused by the fire demon Surtur, one of Asgard's most powerful enemies, Bill agrees to join the Asgardians in a war to stop Surtur and his armies.Thor #337‚Äì340 (November 1983 ‚Äì February 1984) Bill leads many of Earth's heroes against Surtur's forces on Earth while Thor, Odin, and Thor's adopted brother Loki confront Surtur in Asgard.

After finding an orb containing the souls of many of the Korbinites, Bill revisits a desolate Asgard, and joins forces with Stardust to battle a new demonic menace named Asteroth. Although victorious, Bill is mortally wounded, and while near death is healed by an unknown entity that also claims the remaining souls in the orb.

After a brief confrontation with the herald, Stardust, Bill is intercepted by the Silver Surfer, who is puzzled by the Korbinite's apparently futile quest to destroy Galactus. During a brief battle, Bill explains that while he understands he cannot hope to destroy Galactus with his power alone, he intends to destroy Galactus by annihilating any and all worlds Galactus seeks to feed from, thus starving him to death. The character's obsession with stopping Galactus eventually results in him being unable to lift his own enchanted weapon, an object that can only be wielded by the worthy. Equipped with alien weapons, Bill finds Galactus but discovers the entity already under attack by another race. In a moment of conscience, Bill saves Galactus. The grateful entity rewards Bill by creating a Korbinite mate for him, with Bill also regaining the ability to wield Stormbreaker.Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter #1‚Äì3 (August ‚Äì October 2009) =2010s= When the universe is invaded during The Thanos Imperative storyline, Beta Ray Bill joins Nova's select group to travel across the Fault and into the Cancerverse.The Thanos Imperative #3 Bill is recruited by Cosmo to join the Annihilators, a new super-group intended to replace the fallen Guardians of the Galaxy.The Thanos Imperative: Devastation #1, March 2011 The Annihilators defend Galador from the Dire Wraiths, resulting in a peace between the two groups who have been at war for generations.

When Thor became unworthy of Mjolnir after Nick Fury whispered a secret to him, Thor spent months drinking and fighting to avoid thinking about his loss. Bill eventually came to visit Thor- now calling himself 'Odinson'- and offered his old friend Stormbreaker instead, only for Odinson and Bill to be captured by the Collector as they examined the remains of Asgard where the hammer of an alternate version of Thor had recently crashed. Although the Collector tried to force Odinson to help him find some means of bypassing the worthiness enchantment so that he could lift the hammer himself, Odinson eventually escaped and used the hammer's power to return Asgard to its original place. Once free, Odinson told Bill that the secret Fury had shared with him was \\"Gorr was right\\", a reference to Thor's old foe Gorr the God Butcher who believed that all gods brought nothing but pain and suffering to the universe. However, Bill assured Odinson that, regardless of his ability to wield Mjolnir, even if the gods were not worthy, Odinson proved himself to be a hero as he continued to fight for humanity even when officially unworthy.The Unworthy Thor #1-#5 Powers and abilities Beta Ray Bill's life force and consciousness were transferred by scientists of his race into the body of an alien carnivorous equine-like beast that had been bionically restructured into a cyborg. Courtesy of highly advanced genetic engineering and cyborg implants, Beta Ray Bill possesses vast superhuman strength, speed, stamina and durability, and a highly extended lifespan. Beta Ray Bill is also a superior hand-to-hand combatant. His combat prowess is such that he was able to fight Thor, noted as one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the Marvel Universe, to a standstill. Beta Ray Bill's weapon, Stormbreaker, also has the same properties as Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, and includes the ability to transform into a cane when struck upon the ground and return Bill to his unaltered Korbanite form. Beta Ray Bill has a partner in the form of a Korbanite sentient warship named Skuttlebutt. The same technology that transferred Bill's consciousness into his cyborg body, was also used to transfer an unknown Korbanite's consciousness into a large combat cruiser retrofitted with medical, cargo, and humanitarian equipment and facilities to accommodate the attempt to transport Bill's people off planet to avoid the incoming attack by Galactus. Loyal Skuttlebutt often uses his medical facilities to repair Bill's tissue and implants from damage after battles. In other media =Television= * Beta Ray Bill debuts in the Silver Surfer episode \\"Innervisions\\", voiced by Karl Pruner. This version of the character along with the rest of his species shared a group dream using a special \\"dream weaver\\" from Zenn-La. When the Surfer came to alert them that Thanos was approaching, he convinced Beta Ray Bill to end the group dream and save the planet using all of the dream weaver's power to trick Thanos into believing he had succeeded in destroying the planet. * Beta Ray Bill appeared in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"The Saga of Beta Ray Bill\\", voiced by Pat Fraley. Here, it is revealed that the Korbinites were taken over by the rogue known as the Stranger and Bill escaped into the Skuttlebutt to take refuge where he has been its janitor ever since. After proving heroism in saving Thor from the villain and an expert usage of Mjolnir, the hammer then forged Bill's own hammer out of a toilet brush, after which Bill chooses from names such as \\"Windbreaker\\" before finally settling on \\"Stormbreaker\\". It is then that Bill's friends are freed from the Stranger's mind control, and an alliance between the two hammer wielders is forged, with Bill promising to use his friends' technology to get Thor back to his own universe. * Beta Ray Bill appeared in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \\"The Ballad of Beta Ray Bill\\", voiced by Steven Blum. When the Korbinites' homeworld was destroyed by Surtur's Fire Demons, Beta Ray Bill was specially modified to oversee the Korbinites' survival on the Skuttlebutt with the race under cryogenic hibernation. When Surtur's Fire Demons attack the Skuttlebutt, Beta Ray Bill has the Skuttlebutt take refuge in an asteroid field. His presence was detected by Heimdall as Thor sets out to investigate. When Thor makes his way into the Skuttlebutt, he is ambushed by Beta Ray Bill (who mistakens Thor for a Fire Demon) and manages to pin him down. Beta Ray Bill successfully lifts Mjolnir and attacks Thor with it. Beta Ray Bill is then teleported to Asgard by Odin (who was trying to teleport Thor back) where Beta Ray Bill mistakens the Asgardians as Fire Demons and attacks Balder, Sif, and the Warriors Three before being subdued by Odin and finally realizes his error due to Odin's genuine concern and love for his son. Thor is teleported back to Asgard by Odin. When Beta Ray Bill reveals his people's plight and demands to wield Mjolnir to fight the Fire Demons, Sif offers to assist him in the battle and Thor offers Mjolnir. Odin denies the offer made by Thor and says he has an idea. After Thor convinces Eitri to help, Beta Ray Bill receives Stormbreaker (which was made from the remaining Uru following Surtur's raid) and uses it to help Thor and Sif fight the Fire Demons in order to keep them from harming the Korbinites. While Sif and the Skuttlebutt's defenses fight the Fire Demons, Thor and Beta Ray Bill fight Enchantress who has been converted into Surtur's mind-controlled pawn. After Thor and Beta Ray Bill defeat Enchantress which causes the Fire Demons to disappear, Surtur speaks through her telling Thor and Beta Ray Bill that Enchantress is now under his control. Beta Ray Bill then leaves with Skuttlebutt in order to find a safe place for the Korbinites to settle down and repopulate, but he promises to aid Thor in his battle with Surtur, the Fire Demon Lord of Muspelheim. =Film= * Beta Ray Bill appears in the animated DVD film Planet Hulk, voiced by Paul Dobson. He first appears along with Thor in a flashback, battling Kronans. Bill then appears mind- controlled and fights Hulk and his friends. Bill gains the upper hand at first until the Hulk succeeds in beating him down and almost kills him before stopping (although Bill had lowered his guard). Soon, he saves Hulk and his friends from the Red King's attempted torture and death, freeing all of them from the mind control disks and the arena. He later offers to return the Hulk to Earth, but the Hulk declines saying Earth is no longer his home. * Beta Ray Bill was included in an early version of Thor: Ragnarok, though he ultimately did not make an appearance.

The pier named after Am√©d√©e Courbet in Villefranche-sur-Mer- Cote-dAzur Geography Villefranche-sur-Mer is immediately to the east of the city of Nice, along Mont Boron, Mont Alban and Mont Vinaigrier, and south- west of Monaco. The bay (rade) of Villefranche is one of the deepest natural harbours of any port in the Mediterranean Sea and provides safe anchorage for large ships from easterly winds. Reaching depths of 320 ft (95 m) between the Cape of Nice and Cap Ferrat; it extends to the south to form a 1,700 ft (500 m) abyss known as the undersea Canyon of Villefranche at about one nautical mile off the coastline. The city limits extend to the hills surrounding the bay climbing from sea level to an altitude of 1,893 ft (577 m), the highest point of Mont-Leuze, reflecting on land the features found offshore. The three \\"Corniches\\" or main roads linking Nice to Italy pass through Villefranche. History The site of what is now Villefranche and surrounding Beaulieu-sur- Mer and Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat has been settled since prehistoric times. Celto- ligurian tribes roamed the area and established farming communities on the surrounding hills. The Greeks and later the Romans used the natural harbour as a stop-over en route to the Greek settlements around the Western Mediterranean. After the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar, the Romans built an extension of the Via Aurelia (Aurelian Way), which passed through the settlement of Montolivo. By the fall of the Carolingian Empire, the area was part of Lotharingia and later part of the County of Provence. In 1295, Charles II, Duke of Anjou, then Count of Provence, enticed the inhabitants of Montolivo and surroundings to settle closer to the coastline in order to secure the area from pirates. By charter, he established Villefranche as a \\"free port\\", thus the name, granting tax privileges and port fee rights that lasted well into the 18th century. Barelli H. ‚Äì Rocca R.:‚Äô‚ÄôHistoire de l‚ÄôIdentit√© Ni√ßoise‚Äô‚Äô, page 22-31, Serre Editeur 1998 By 1388, East Provence became part of the Duchy of Savoy as a result of the disputed succession to the heirless Queen Joan I of Naples. For the next 400 years, the area known as the County of Nice was hotly disputed between the Holy Roman Empire to which Savoy was an ally and the French. In 1543, the Franco-Turkish armies sacked and occupied the city after the siege of Nice, prompting Duke Emmanuel Philibert to secure the site by building an impressive citadel and a fort on nearby Mont Alban. In the late 17th century, the area fell to the French but was returned to Savoy after the Peace of Utrecht. Tracou C.-Richard D.:‚Äô‚ÄôLa Rade √âtincelante‚Äô‚Äô, page 11, 66 and 77, √âditions 2Fab 1995 During the 18th century, the city lost some of its maritime importance to the new harbour being built in Nice but remained a military and naval base. In 1744, a Franco- Spanish army under the Prince of Conti overran the Piedmontese regiments of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia at the Fort of Mont Alban in the heights above the town. In 1793, the French returned to re-occupy Villefranche and the county of Nice remained part of the Napoleonic Empire until 1814. It was returned to the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna. In 1860, as a consequence of the Risorgimento, it was given to France by treaty following a plebiscite. By the late 19th century, it had become an important Imperial Russian Navy base and the Russians established an oceanographic laboratory in the old lazaret. The site was also the winter residence for royalty and wealthy visitors. Villefranche's bay is notable for reaching a significant depth only a short distance from shore. As a result, it has become an important port over the years. Since World War I, the United States Navy has called on a regular basis, making Villefranche the home port of the U.S. 6th Fleet from 1948 to February 1966, when French President Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from NATO and required U.S. forces to leave. Just prior to 1966, the flagship of the Commander Sixth Fleet rotated between and .http://www.usslittlerock.org/Villefranche/villafrance.html Since the 1980s Villefranche has been used by cruise ships. It is the most visited cruise ship port of call in France. Population Villefranche is now part of the Urban community of Nice C√¥te d'Azur and so can be considered a suburb of the Nice metropolitan area. The decrease in population in recent years and especially in the 1990s can be attributed to the cost of real estate and an increase of part-time residents, who typically are not counted in the census. But Villefranche's aging population, like elsewhere in the eastern part of the Alpes-Maritimes, is not being replaced by younger people at the same rate as in the rest of the d√©partement. Economy The main activity remains tourism, with hotels and restaurants employing a sizeable portion of the population. Traditional activities, like fishing, have now given way to sea-related activities, such as sailing and deep sea diving. Some dockyard activity remains at the harbour of ‚Äúla Darse‚Äù but most of it has now been moved to Antibes. Residential construction and maintenance, which provided a lot of employment in the mid 20th century, has now subsided considerably.

He controlled Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û; covering parts of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu) with another warlord, Han Sui. Ma Teng and Han Sui were involved in efforts to gain autonomy from the Han central government. Life Descendant of Ma Yuan, Ma Teng was from Maoling County (), Fufeng Commandery () (present-day Xingping, Shaanxi). His father, Ma Ping (), was a minor official in Tianshui Commandery, but because of some dispute he was dismissed from his post, and went to live among the Qiang people. Ma Teng grew up in extreme poverty and made a living selling firewood he collected in the mountains. After growing up, his height was said to have been over eight chi, (‚âà1.86 metres). He was said to have been fierce in appearance, but kind to others, wise, and respected by many. In 184, during the final years of Emperor Ling's reign, the Qiang people in Liang Province rose up against the local government under Beigong Yu () and Liwen Hou (). They were joined by members of the local gentry Han Sui and Bian Zhang. The official Han governor of Liang Province, Geng Bi (), gathered forces to put down the rebellion, and Ma Teng volunteered as a foot soldier. His skills in battle against the rebels were recognised and he rose through the ranks of the soldiery. However, when Geng Bi was killed in battle by the rebel army, Ma Teng switched sides and joined Han Sui. The rebellion was eventually suppressed by the Han general Huangfu Song but Ma Teng escaped along with the rebels. In the end, the central government granted military titles to some of the rebel leaders in order to appease them. When Li Jue and Guo Si seized power over Chang'an after Dong Zhuo's assassination, Ma Teng and Han Sui at first pledged allegiance to them, and were appointed as General who Attacks the West () and General who Guards the West () respectively. However, the relationship between the two sides quickly soured, and Ma Teng and Han Sui led their armies in an attempt to seize Chang'an. They allied themselves with the warlord Liu Yan, but suffered defeats from the hands of Li Jue's forces led by Guo Si, Fan Chou and Li Li. Not only was the loss of 10,000 soldiers a heavy blow to the morale of the allied forces, they also faced a supply shortage at the time, so the eloquent Han Sui asked Fan Chou for a private talk, during which Han Sui successfully persuaded Fan Chou to abort the pursuit because they shared the same hometown. The allied forces then retreated back to Liang Province safely. Although Ma Teng was initially on good terms with Han Sui, the two went to war against each other over control of Liang Province. The fighting escalated to a point where they were killing each other's wives and children. Cao Cao, who at this point had decisively defeated Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, brokered peace between Ma Teng and Han Sui, who then pledged allegiance to the Han dynasty and sent troops to assist Cao Cao in defeating Yuan Shao's successors and remnants. After this, Ma Teng was summoned to Ye city with most of his family, and was appointed Minister of the Guards (). His eldest son, Ma Chao, remained behind in Liang Province with Han Sui. Around early 211, Ma Chao secretly formed a coalition with Han Sui and other minor warlords in Liang Province and started a rebellion against the Han dynasty. While persuading Han Sui to join him, Ma Chao said, \\"[...] Now, I abandon my father, and I'm willing to acknowledge you as my father. You should also abandon your son, and treat me like your son.\\"(ÂèäÁ¥ÑÈÇÑÔºåË∂ÖË¨ÇÁ¥ÑÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂâçÈçæÂè∏Èö∏‰ªªË∂Ö‰ΩøÂèñÂ∞áËªçÔºåÈóúÊù±‰∫∫‰∏çÂèØË§á‰ø°‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäË∂ÖÊ£ÑÁà∂Ôºå‰ª•Â∞áËªçÁÇ∫Áà∂ÔºåÂ∞áËªç‰∫¶Áï∂Ê£ÑÂ≠êÔºå‰ª•Ë∂ÖÁÇ∫Â≠ê„ÄÇ„ÄçË°åË´´Á¥ÑÔºå‰∏çÊ¨≤‰ª§ËàáË∂ÖÂêà„ÄÇÁ¥ÑË¨ÇË°åÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ªäË´∏Â∞á‰∏çË¨ÄËÄåÂêåÔºå‰ººÊúâÂ§©Êï∏„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÊù±Ë©£ËèØÈô∞„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 15.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Ma Teng is portrayed as a loyalist of the declining Han dynasty. He participates a plot with Liu Bei and Dong Cheng to assassinate Cao Cao, who in the novel, is depicted as a villain monopolising power and holding Emperor Xian hostage. However, the plot is unsuccessful and Ma Teng returns to Liang Province. When Ma Teng is later recalled to the imperial capital Xuchang, he decides to again join a plot to assassinate Cao Cao, this time with Huang Kui (). However, the plot is discovered and he is executed along with his sons Ma Xiu () and Ma Tie (). Upon hearing of his father and brothers' deaths, Ma Chao becomes filled with rage and goes to war with Cao Cao to avenge his family, starting the Battle of Tong Pass.

It first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (2005) and later appeared in the films Rogue One (2016) and Episode IX ‚Äì The Rise of Skywalker (2019). In Revenge of the Sith, it was the location of the climactic lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and his former pupil, Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker). The planet has also featured in various spin-off media.  Development  While franchise creator George Lucas was writing the sequels of the original Star Wars trilogy, he outlined the backstory that would eventually be seen in the prequel trilogy, including the climactic duel between Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Sith Lord Darth Vader (formerly Kenobi's pupil, Anakin Skywalker). In the novelization of Return of the Jedi, Obi-Wan recounts his battle with Anakin, stating that the latter \\"fell into a molten pit\\". During the pre-production of Revenge of the Sith, Steven Spielberg was brought in as a \\"guest director\\" to make suggestions to the art designers for the duel scene. He suggested that Anakin and Obi-Wan should be \\"dripping sweat\\" and that \\"their hair at some point should be smoking\\", which Lucas loved. While the film was in production, Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the film; 910 artists created 49 seconds of footage for the duel over 70,441 man hours.Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith DVD documentary Within a Minute [2005]. In deciding to place Vader's castle on the planet, the creators of Rogue One drew inspiration from a Ralph McQuarrie concept painting from the original trilogy depicting the Emperor enthroned over a lava lake.  Appearances  In Revenge of the Sith, the planet serves as the hiding place of the Separatist leaders during the final hours of the Clone Wars, until they are killed by Darth Vader. The Sith lord is later permanently scarred in a battle with Obi-Wan Kenobi on the banks of a volcano on the planet. During the Imperial era, Vader builds his personal fortress on the planet; he makes a brief appearance in this location in Rogue One. In The Rise of Skywalker, set over three decades later, Vader's grandson, Kylo Ren, retrieves a Sith wayfinder from the ruins of Vader's castle. The setting is not made explicit in the film itself, as it looks different from its earlier appearances. The virtual reality game series Vader Immortal reveals that the planet was originally lush and forested, before becoming volcanic and almost lifeless during an ancient battle. By the time of The Rise of Skywalker, it has begun to heal itself, now hosting iron trees. The planet also appears in the animated television series The Clone Wars and Rebels. In the spin-off comics Tales from Vader's Castle (2018) and Return to Vader's Castle (2019), published by IDW Publishing, the dark lord's fortress serves as the location for a Halloween-themed anthology series of horror stories. The natives of the planet are known as Mustafarians.

Biography Born in Victoria, British Columbia, Sophie, as she was known throughout her life, was the daughter of Teresa Jane Grautoff and Joseph Despard Pemberton (1821‚Äì1893). A successful executive with the Hudson's Bay Company and the first Surveyor-General of Vancouver Island, her father could afford to send her to live and study in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian. \\"Little Boy Blue\\" (1897) by Sophie Pemberton (1869‚Äì1959) Pemberton painted at a time when her chosen media had been the exclusive domain of men and her European influences can be seen in her work. The painter of both portraits and landscapes, Pemberton was the first artist from the province of British Columbia to receive international acclaim when her work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London, including her award-winning 1897 work seen here, entitled Little Boy Blue. While in London she shared a studio with Anna Nordgren, whom she probably had met in Paris. Beyond her work on canvas, Pemberton taught painting to local female artists. In 1909 she did the artistic decoration for the non-denominational Pemberton Memorial Chapel gifted by her family to Victoria's Royal Jubilee Hospital. Pemberton showed her work at the Royal Academy, the Paris Salon, and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (the St. Louis World's Fair). She alternated between living in England and Victoria. She had a solo show in Victoria in 1902. In 1906 she was elected an Associate of the Royal Canadian Academy. A retrospective of her work was shown at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1954, and a second one at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria in 1967. Education Pemberton studied at the Slade School of Art, London (1892 - 1896) and at the Academie Julian, Paris (1897). She studied under Mr. Cope at South Kensington, at the Westminster School of Art. As a landscape artist she is considered self-taught and as having developed her own style.[Studio-Talk. (July 1909): p. 129] Memberships She was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Personal life In 1905, she married Canon Arthur Beanlands, an Anglican priest, a widower and traveled with him to India. He died in 1917 and in 1920 she married Horace Deane-Drummond, who was older than her and indeed had children almost her age. Death Pemberton died on October 31, 1959 in Victoria and was interred there in the Ross Bay Cemetery.

Cansfield, (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2014 representing the riding of Etobicoke Centre. Background Cansfield was born in Alberta in 1945. Prior to entering politics she was a homemaker, raising two children with her husband Bill. They live in central Etobicoke. Politics =School trustee= In 1988, Cansfield was elected to the Etobicoke Board of Education. During her tenure she served as president of the Ontario Public School Boards' Association and later as president of the Canadian School Boards Association. She lost this position in 1997 when Ontario withdrew from the national association. In November 1997 she was elected trustee as a member of the newly amalgamated Toronto District School Board. In December 2001 she was elected by a vote of 12‚Äì10 as president of the school board beating her rival Kathleen Wynne. In January 2003 Cansfield agreed to share the board chair position with Shelley Carroll. This came about because the board was deeply split by the province's takeover of the school board in 2002 by superintendent Paul Christie. The province took this action because the board could not balance its budget. The dual chair position was to remain in place until the following election in November 2003. However, Cansfield resigned her position as co-chair four months later in order to focus on her run as a candidate in the 2003 provincial election. She retained her position as trustee. =Provincial politics= While there was some perception that Cansfield had centre-right or conservative views, she opted to run as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Etobicoke Centre in the 2003 election. Her decision to run for the Liberals rather than the Conservatives may have been driven by her distaste for the way that the Ernie Eves government had dealt with the budget crisis of the Toronto District School Board. She said, \\"I do not see a light at the end of the tunnel with this government. I'm tired of people not standing up and saying, 'I believe in public education.'\\" She based her campaign on improvements to the education system and handily beat Conservative rival Rose Andrachuk by 4,460 votes. Cansfield was appointed Parliamentary Assistant (PA) to Energy Minister Dwight Duncan on 23 October 2003. She was appointed as Minister of Energy on 11 October 2005 when Duncan was named as Minister of Finance. She was reassigned as Minister of Transportation on 23 May 2006, when Duncan returned to Energy. After the 2007 election, Cansfield became Ontario's Minister of Natural Resources, where she served until 18 January 2010. Premier McGuinty appointed Cansfield as PA to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing after the January 2010 cabinet shuffle. In 2011, she was appointed as PA to the Minister of Economic Development and Innovation and in 2012 as PA to the Minister of Finance. In February 2013 as part of the Wynne government, she was appointed as chief government whip. Cansfield left provincial politics after she declined to seek another term in the 2014 Ontario election. =Cabinet positions= Electoral record References External links * Category:1945 births Category:Women government ministers of Canada Category:Living people Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:People from Etobicoke Category:Politicians from Toronto Category:Toronto District School Board trustees Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Women MPPs in Ontario Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:21st-century Canadian women politicians ","title":"Donna Cansfield"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",I]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/16.md","filePath":"guide/16.md"}'),D={name:"guide/16.md"},x=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{N as __pageData,x as default};
