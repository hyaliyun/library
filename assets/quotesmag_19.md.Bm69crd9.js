In 1991 Japanese tended to live in the 15th and 16th arrondissements and the suburban communities of Boulogne-Billancourt and Neuilly-sur-Seine.

This is a list of bird species confirmed in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Bird Records Committee of Nature Newfoundland & Labrador (Nature NL) lists 398 species as occurring in Newfoundland as of March 2016. Between that date and July 2020, 18 additional species have been added by eBird users. Of these 416 species, 112 are rare and 88 are very rare as defined below. Two were introduced to North America. One species is possibly extinct, and another species formerly found in Labrador is known to be extinct but is not on the Nature NL checklist. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that Canadian English spellings are used and the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following codes are used to describe some categories of occurrence. *(R) Rare - \\"not likely to be found annually, though apparently occurs regularly in very small numbers\\" per Nature NL *(VR) Very rare - \\"recorded three times or less\\" per Nature NL Ducks, geese, and waterfowl American black duck Long-tailed duck Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

Their long wings have black markings, as does the head. *White- tailed tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus (VR) Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons are aquatic birds, the size of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely grey or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but are almost hopeless on land, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body. *Red-throated loon, Gavia stellata *Pacific loon, Gavia pacifica (VR) *Common loon, Gavia immer *Yellow-billed loon, Gavia adamsii (VR) Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses are amongst the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. *Black-browed albatross, Thalassarche melanophris (VR) Southern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat- like. Until 2018, this family's three species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. *Leach's storm-petrel, Hydrobates leucorhous Shearwaters and petrels Great shearwater Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Northern fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis *Fea's petrel, Pterodroma feae (VR) *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black- and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens (VR) Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies.

It also stars Tomisaburo Wakayama who would later play the lead in the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Zatoichi and the Chest of Gold is the sixth episode in the 26-part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi, following Zatoichi on the Road and preceding Zatoichi's Flashing Sword. Plot Ichi travels to the village of Itakura to pay respects at the grave of a man he killed two years earlier. At the grave he reminisces on a fight between the two yakuza gangs (Iioka and Sasagawa from an earlier film) one man ran away and, though Ichi was not taking part in the fight, attacked Ichi. The dead man's sister, Chiyo, overhears Ichi say this to himself. Ichi is invited to take part in a village celebration: after three years of drought and near famine they and seventeen other villages in Usui county have raised 1,000 Ryo with which to pay taxes to the local intendant. Ichi gladly joins in while the locals sing of their hero Chuji- who lives in the hills with a troupe, hiding from the constabulary while protecting the villagers. As they transport the gold to the local intendant (Gundayu) they are ambushed by three samurai (led by Jushiro, who wields a whip) and then by a larger band. Several of the villagers are slain and the rest flee. When the robbers chase the chest of gold to the base of the hill, they find Ichi sitting atop it smoking his pipe. He kills several men when attacked and the rest flee. In the village the local men accost Ichi, blaming him for its theft, before he promises to find the gold. The conversation is overheard by a well dressed woman called Ogin. Taking the backroads to avoid government checkpoints he encounters her again. When she questions his motive for being on the backroad he replies that he could not tell, as he is blind and then asks her why she is on the same road. In the onsen at her destination Ogin takes a private room only for Ichi to rise from the water. He recognizes her and reassures her that he is blind and can see nothing (else he would be peeking, and at this he squirts two men who are peeping through a window on the roof) and they briefly talk. When she leaves she sees the sister, Chiyo, and asks why she has been following Ichi from Itakura. On Mt Akagi several of Chuji's troupe inform him that some of the men were killed by a blind man with a sword, only for Ichi to arrive to ask Chuji why he stole the money. Ichi informs the bandit that some of his men have gone rogue and stolen the chest of gold- though the two men are quick to confess and ask that he kill them for their acts. Losing his taste for the bandit life style, Chuji decides to leave and asks Ichi to take a different route- in order to escort the young nephew of one of the troupe to safety, before thanking Ichi for his faith in him. In the nearby town, Ogin (the lover of Monji), accompanied by Chiyo, tells Monji about Ichi going to the bandits and Monji promises revenge for the sister. Monji has just been promoted to head of the local constabulary and received his jitte (one pronged iron truncheon) as mark of office. He organizes a number of men to capture Ichi and the bandits on Mt Akagi. Ichi hears them coming and raises the alarm system the bandits set up at the bottom of the mountain, attracting the police and killing many of them to allow the others more time to escape. However the others are soon trapped and die defending their boss. The next morning in an inn, Monji talks with Jushiro about their plan, but the other two samurai are disgruntled at being treated poorly when they learn of a blind gambler doing well at the dice hall. They approach him and after Jushiro cuts a mon coin in half by throwing his sword in the air, they bet Ichi 35 Ry≈ç that he can't do the same. He accepts and wins. Outside, he confronts the two samurai whose conversation he overheard. While they deny knowledge, one of them inadvertently reveals the intendant's involvement. Ichi pays them 10 Ry≈ç, but they still attack him and are killed. The Itakura village headman pleads for Intendant Gundayu to be lenient as the tax money was stolen. Gundayu accuses the headman of lying, insisting that the tax be paid in ten days. Jushiro talks to Gundayu, with Monji present, and reveals that Gundayu is the recipient of the stolen 1000 Ry≈ç and demands more money. Ichi arrives and Jushiro calls Ichi a worm, though he wants to kill him privately so that the other two men get no pleasure from seeing their enemy killed. Monji orders his men to capture Ichi but Jushiro knocks them back with his whip, saying they will only die and Ichi leaves unmolested. Gundayu orders the headman and three other village men executed at dawn. On his return to Itakura, Ichi is mobbed, but they stop when some calls him a blind fool and his demeanour changes. He leaves and Chiyo follows him. He says he sensed who she was from the start and she pleads with Ichi to save them. The Itakura villagers had hoped to launch an attack against Gandayu's troops, believing they have nothing to lose, but lose heart when it's learned that he has deployed eight musketeers as part of his force. However, Zatoichi launches a surprise attack and succeeds in killing the riflemen. Learning of this, Monji and Gundayu panic. Gundayu starts to destroy written evidence of the crime, saving himself while implicating Monji, when Monji demands half the gold, only to be killed by Gundayu. Ichi arrives as Gundayu flees and says Gundayu can atone by giving the farmers a receipt for their taxes and returning the gold to them. He attacks Ichi and is killed. Jushiro arrives and says he does not want the gold but to meet him at Bodai Temple in an hour. Chiyo is waiting for Ichi and he gives her the gold. He also gives his gambling winnings for a proper headstone for her brother. Chiyo, possibly taken with Ichi, pleads with him to stay for the forthcoming celebration in the village. Jushiro arrives at the duel on a horse and wraps his whip around Ichi's neck, dragging him along behind and causing Ichi to drop his sword. However, Jushiro drags him back past his sword. Ichi pulls Jushiro from his horse, then reclaims his weapon and kills him, and apparently starts back towards the village to keep his promise to celebrate with Chiyo...

It is named after an early steam-powered saw mill. Geography Steam Mill Village is located about 10 km north of Kentville. Route 359, runs through the community. Steam Mill occupies low sandy hills of glacial till marked by stands of oak trees and many large pines. The upper reaches of the Canard River flow through the northern part of Steam Mill Village. History Steam Mill is near the headwaters of the Canard River and was once the head of tide from the river's saltwater estuary. The area was used by early Acadian settlers and later New England Planters at nearby Upper Dyke on the Canard River who used the Steam Mill area in the 18th century as upland pasture. Near the present day crossing of Route 359 over the river, the Acadians built the first of series of dykes across the Canard River, pushing back the salt water tides to create highly productive farmland along the river.Marjory Whitelaw, The Wellington Dyke Nimbus Publishing (1997), page 23 In the 19th century, the community was the site of one of the first steam saw mills in Kings County, thus earning its name. The mill is believed to have operated where the Elm Grove cemetery stands today. In 1889, the Cornwallis Valley Railway, a branch line of the Dominion Atlantic Railway arrived which later became the Kingsport Subdivision of the DAR with the railway station at Steam Mill Village appearing as \\"Mill Village\\" on railway timetables. Camp Aldershot, a militia training camp was established in 1904 beside Steam Mill. After World War II, the community became the site of several plants selling bulk feed and agricultural supplies located along the railway. In 1961, the Cornwallis Valley Railway was abandoned beyond Steam Mill, making the community the terminus of the \\"CVR Spur\\" serving the bulk feed mills. Railway service ended completely in 1993 and the tracks were removed in 1994.\\"Mill Village\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Institute  References  * Nova Scotia Archives: Place Names of Nova Scotia, \\"Steam Mill\\", p.644 Category:Communities in Kings County, Nova Scotia Category:General Service Areas in Nova Scotia ","title":"Steam Mill Village"},{"id":"41533586","text":"Juha Tarkkanen (born July 10, 1993) is a Finnish ice hockey defenceman.

During the next decade, he was able to meet or be influenced by Lloyd, Fattori, and Signorini. In 1900 he began to experiment with Divisionism, influenced by Vittore Grubicy, with whom he became close friends. In 1901‚Äì2, he exhibited Cavallo alla mangiatoia and Trittico di Suese. He moved to Milan where he met Pellizza da Volpedo and Morbelli. In 1907 he exhibited landscapes of Livorno at the Italian Divisionist Exposition, organized at the Grubicy Gallery in Paris, and in 1909 participated in the Paris Salon d'Automme with his fellow Tuscans, Lloyd and Plinio Nomellini. In 1911 he exhibited at the Mostra di Arte Libera in Milan. In 1914, with his friends Raffaello Gambogi and Puccini, he formed part of the 83rd Esposition of the Societ√† Amatori e Cultori of Rome.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, and iOS on 14 December 2017, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2018, and shortly thereafter an Android and Kindle Fire release. Gorogoa has the player manipulate images placed in a two-by-two grid, exploring within each image as well as placing or stacking images relative to others, to solve puzzles. Through the puzzles, the player guides a boy as they encounter a strange monster among a landscape that becomes war-ravaged and then rebuilt. The boy grows older and ends up as an old man reflecting on his past. The game, solely developed by Roberts, started as a failed attempt at an interactive graphic novel, and took nearly six years to complete.  Gameplay  Puzzles in Gorogoa involve manipulating the scenes within each of the panels, as well as moving the panels around themselves to connect them up and create new scenes. In Gorogoa players are presented with up to four images in a two-by-two grid. Most images can be manipulated on their own, such as zooming in or out from the image, or panning across the image. The player can also move the image to any of the other grid spaces. In some cases, the image presents a hole such as a doorway, so when moved onto a different image, the moved image becomes a mask to cover the existing image, creating a new image. Through this method, the player must stack, combine, and explore each image to find a connection between them in order to advance and open new areas. Players are not guided through the process, as the game contains no language, and must work out what they need to do to finish each level, though when the player has successfully completed a connection, the images will briefly animate on their own, showcasing their result to the player. The plot involves a boy seeking an encounter with a divine monster, exploring themes of spirituality and religion. The scenes in the game follow periods of time in the 20th century, including peace, war, and rebuilding, and the life of the boy as a survivor of war, living through the rebuilding, and then reflecting on his past as an old man.  Development  Roberts at the 2018 Game Developers Conference Jason Roberts began development of a card game inspired by interactive comics in his spare time while working full-time, but later decided the style was too complex. Roberts considered writing a graphic novel, but following the success of indie games such as Braid, he realised he could combine his love of art and interactive video games, despite knowing very little about how to develop them. Development on the game began in 2011, with Roberts quitting his full- time job to focus on the game. Originally planned for release in 2013, Roberts ran out of money two years after starting development. He was able to fund his work for another year through investment from Indie Fund, and in December 2016 Annapurna Pictures announced that it would begin publishing games as Annapurna Interactive, with Gorogoa being one of its first published games. Roberts adopted the title Gorogoa from a name he invented for an imaginary creature in his youth. He chose it for the game because it was not part of any existing language, wanting the game to be accessible to anyone, regardless of language, and therefore also choosing not to add any to the game. Gorogoa was originally written in a custom-built game engine created by Roberts in Java, but it was ultimately ported to the Unity game engine so that it could be more easily distributed on multiple platforms, including the Nintendo Switch. All illustrations are hand drawn by Roberts. Roberts cites David Roberts, Gustave Dor√©, Christopher Manson, and Chris Ware as influences to his art style. Roberts also stated that his was indirectly influenced by Byzantine art, due to travels to Istanbul and other similar locations. Roberts found such two- dimensional art challenged him of how to explore that within three dimensional spaces within his puzzles. Further, it helped to suggest a world with a similar history to the real world. The game's audio, for the first few years of development, was composed by Austin Wintory, until Roberts decided he wanted a different style and instead hired Joel Corelitz, who also composed the audio for 2012 video game The Unfinished Swan. Eduardo Ortiz Frau is the game's sound designer. The score is a composite of audio from each panel currently viewed by the player. The game was revealed at the 2012 IndieCade, with a demo version released shortly afterwards, and was released in full in December 2017. Roberts says the game took much longer to develop than he anticipated, in part because as his drawing skills grew he kept going back to re-draw earlier scenes. He also scrapped and recreated large completed sections of the game multiple times during development.  Reception  Prior to release, Gorogoa won the Visual Design Award at the 2012 IndieCade, and in 2013 won the Good Game Club top prize. The game also won the 2014 Independent Games Festival Excellence in Visual Art award for which it also received honorable mentions in the Design and Narrative categories. Following the full release of the game, it received generally positive reviews from critics, holding a score of 84/100 on PC and 91/100 on iOS on Metacritic. Reviewers particularly praised Gorogoa's illustrations and graphics. Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica described the game as the \\"prettiest hand-drawn, hand-illustrated video game ever made\\", and Philippa Warr, writing for PC Gamer, called it \\"utterly beautiful\\". Writing for The Verge, Andrew Webster praised the game's lack of frustration, rarely finding himself stuck or unable to progress with a puzzle as a result of the game's design, a sentiment echoed by Warr. In VentureBeat's review, Stephanie Chan praised the game's accessibility and the satisfaction of completing the puzzles. Rob Kershaw at Jump Dash Roll agreed, writing that Gorogoa was \\"beautifully illustrated\\" and \\"a marvel of game design\\". Machkovech, though, found some annoyance with puzzles which didn't have a clear solution process. At two to three hours, the game's length was described as \\"short-and-sweet\\" by Machkovech, albeit wishing it was longer. Some reviewers, such as Warr, expressed a desire to play through the game multiple times to digest the story. Eurogamer ranked Gorogoa 49th on its list of the \\"Top 50 Games of 2017\\", while Polygon ranked it 35th on their list of the 50 best games of 2017. The game was nominated for \\"Best Mobile Game\\", \\"Best Puzzle Game\\", and \\"Most Innovative\\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. It won the award for \\"Best Mobile Game\\" and the \\"Innovation Award\\" at the 18th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards, whereas its other nomination was for \\"Best Debut\\" (Jason Roberts/Buried Signal); it was also nominated for \\"Excellence in Art\\" and \\"Mobile Game of the Year\\" at the 2018 SXSW Gaming Awards. In addition, it was nominated for \\"D.I.C.E.

The game was nominated for \\"Best Storytelling\\", \\"Best Visual Design\\", \\"Best Indie Game\\", and \\"Mobile Game of the Year\\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards.

The gameplay is comparable to Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda with a top-down view and a mixture of action, adventure, and puzzle solving. It was first released for the Apple IIGS in 1991, and requires at least 1MB of RAM. A stereo card is recommended since it implements 15 channel, stereo background music. Players are given the option at the beginning of the game to play in either English or French. The game is not hard drive installable since it uses a custom operating system; therefore a 3.5\\" disk drive is required to play. GATE was ported to the Macintosh in 1994, by J√∂rg Kienzle with graphics designed by Val√©rie Kienzle. The game requires at least 4MB of RAM and runs on 68k or PowerPC Macs running an operating system between OS 6.0.7 and OS 9.2.2. Besides playing the game in either English or French, players can also choose German or Kanji in this version. It is hard drive installable and requires 4.5 MB of disk space. Although it was initially released by Seven Hills Software, J√∂rg Kienzle made it available as shareware in 1996.  Background  The game was programmed by Henrik Gudat when he was a college student. The starting point was a bet at school who could actually write a complete action game. After the basic functions were implemented, J√∂rg Kienzle and Yann Le Tensorer were both involved to provide graphics, sound effects and music.

Early life Born in Bucharest, Romania, to Jewish parents of German and Hungarian origin, Stern studied under Nikolaos Gyzis and Franz Stuck at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich beginning in 1894. Career Drawing by Ernst Stern for the scene \\"Before the harem\\" in Sumur√ªn from Friedrich Freksa to Kammerspiele in 1910 Stern moved to Berlin in 1905, where Max Reinhardt hired him the next year as a set designer for the Deutsches Theater. He remained Max Reinhardt's main design collaborator until the director's departure in 1921 and designed roughly ninety shows during that time, with notable works including adaptations of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1907), Hamlet (1909), and A Midsummer Night's Dream (1913), Karl Vollm√∂ller's The Miracle (1911), Reinhard Sorge's The Beggar (1917), and Henrik Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman (1917). Under Reinhardt, the Deutsches Theater became a center of German Expressionist Theater, so Stern designed many sets in that style. As Stern's design aesthetics tended towards serenity and realism, however, this pairing was not always successful. Perhaps his most noteworthy expressionist work was Paul Leni's 1924 silent film Waxworks (1924), for which he designed the costumes. Stern collaborated at some point with nearly all the important German film directors of the period, including F.W. Murnau, Ernst Lubitsch, Richard Oswald, Carl Froelich, and William Dieterle. In 1924, Stern moved on to the Gro√ües Schauspielhaus, where he designed for a number of musical revues and the popular musical The White Horse Inn (1930). In the late 1920s, Stern also began spending considerable time in London, where he designed the sets for No√´l Coward's Bitter Sweet (1929) and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's Ever Green (1930). His submitted designs to Rupert D'Oyly Carte for new settings for \\"The Gondoliers\\" and \\"The Yeomen of the Guard\\" (c.1920s, dates unknown), which contain many traditional qualities at variance with his reputation for expressionism, but they were never put into production (the paintings still survive). When the Nazi Party seized power in Germany in 1933, Stern was in Paris attending a performance of The White Horse Inn. He remained in the city for a time and then settled permanently in London in 1934. For the rest of his life he primarily collaborated with British writers at the Savoy Theatre, Aldwych Theatre, and Adelphi Theatre. He also designed the displays for Selfridges for the coronation of King George VI and collaborated with Donald Wolfit on several Shakespeare productions during World War II. Later life Stern was awarded a pension by George VI and died in London.

The discovery of the stone called into question the first discovery of gold and the history of gold mining in the Black Hills; it would mean that gold was discovered in the Black Hills 40 years before the Custer Expedition of 1874 and the subsequent Black Hills Gold Rush. It is currently on display at the Adams Museum & House in Deadwood, South Dakota. History The early history of the people mentioned on the stone is limited. Two experienced miners were among the party of seven: William King and Indian Crow. According to the stone, Ezra Kind and his party traveled to the Black Hills in 1833 in search of gold, at which time a treaty prevented the party from entering the area legally. The stone itself was inscribed in 1834 by Ezra Kind after his entire party was killed by Native Americans. Kind himself later died of unknown causes. On March 14, 1887, Norwegian immigrants and brothers Louis and Ivan Thoen discovered the slab while collecting sandstone on the west face of Lookout Mountain near his home in Spearfish. The stone was buried several feet below the surface. The men took the slab home, and Louis invited Henry Keats (a later mayor of Spearfish) to see the stone and the location where it was found. The stone was then taken to the Spearfish Register. One day later, Louis decided to display it in a store in Spearfish that was owned by John Cashner; Cashner and Louis sold pictures of the stone as postcards. In 1888, Cashner traveled to the Detroit Free Press in Michigan and sold the story of the stone to the newspaper. Louis died in 1919 during the 1918 influenza pandemic. The stone was named for Louis Thoen. In 1966, historian Frank Thomson published a book about the stone, titled The Thoen Stone: A Saga of the Black Hills. A monument complete with a replica of the stone was later placed on a hill above the Spearfish City Park, and an annual seven-mile run past the marker is named after the stone. Doom metal band Pine Beetle has a song called \\"Thoen\\" which is based on the Thoen Stone mystery. Description The Thoen Stone is carved out of sandstone. It is three inches thick and measures 10 inches by eight inches. =Inscription= Text is written in a cursive font on both sides of the slab. The inscription on the front reads: > Came to these hills in 1833 seven of us DeLacompt Ezra Kind G.W. Wood T. > Brown R. Kent Wm. King Indian Crow All dead but me, Ezra Kind. Killed by > [Indians] beyond the high hill. Got our gold June 1834. The inscription continues on the back and reads: > Got all the gold we could carry. Our ponies all got by the Indians. I have > lost my gun and nothing to eat and Indians hunting me. Controversy Since its discovery in 1887, controversy over the authenticity of the Thoen Stone has circulated. Many people believe that the stone is a hoax and was fabricated by Louis and Ivan Thoen. Some have pointed to the fact that Louis Thoen was a stonemason. Until their deaths, the Thoens defended the authenticity of the stone. In the 1950s, Frank Thomson traveled to the East Coast in search of the families of the party's members. Thomson located several families, all with surnames similar to those listed on the Thoen Stone, who claimed to have had ancestors who disappeared in the American West. In the 2000s, handwriting expert Marion Briggs and another in California compared the handwriting on the postcards and the writing on the slab. Both determined that the inscriptions were not done by the same person, and the stone was not inscribed by either of the two Thoen brothers, Cashner, or John S. McClintock, who was an early advocate for the slab's authenticity.

The lure: business opportunities in the highly industrialized Ruhr region.\\" History In 1950 there was one Japanese person registered as living in D√ºsseldorf.Kerbo and Ziltener, p. 230. Beginning in the mid-1950s the Japanese companies returning to Germany in the post-World War II period were mostly settling in D√ºsseldorf,Kerbo and Ziltener, p. 229-230. while in the pre-World War II period the Japanese population was concentrated in Hamburg.Kerbo and Ziltener, p. 229. Arikawa stated that the Japanese settlement began when ten businesspersons from Tokyo, trying to buy metal ore and machinery for Japan, established their businesses in D√ºsseldorf. Due to this settlement, information about the Ruhr region circulated within Japanese companies. 300 Japanese were registered as living in the city by 1960. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1966. There were 100 Japanese companies in the D√ºsseldorf area in 1968. Due to D√ºsseldorf's central location within Europe and proximity to other areas in Europe, its location in the Ruhr industrial area, and the proximity to the seaport Duisburg, Japanese companies had a preference for D√ºsseldorf as they established European operations in the 1970s. By 1973 2,000 Japanese were registered as living in D√ºsseldorf and 200 Japanese companies were located in the area. By 1980 the number of Japanese companies had increased to 300. As of 1985 there were 6,000 Japanese residents. In 1990 there were 30 Japanese production facilities in the city. By 1992, 7,443 Japanese were registered as living in the city. Due to the reunification of Germany making Berlin the capital of the country, the decline in the Japanese economy, and the European Single Market causing Japanese companies to move to places with lower costs, since 1992 there had been a decline in the Japanese community. Many of the Japanese companies had shifted to the Netherlands. In the late 1990s the D√ºsseldorf area housed 520 Japanese companies. In 1999 about 4,500 Japanese people lived in and around D√ºsseldorf. By the late 1990s there were almost no Japanese production facilities in D√ºsseldorf, or in all of Germany. Due to the infrastructure and support from the Japanese community, including the Japanese school and the Buddhist centre, many companies that had moved out of D√ºsseldorf in the early 1990s, especially those that had moved to Berlin, began moving back to D√ºsseldorf by the late 1990s.

Life  Hachmann was born in Blankenese, now part of Hamburg, Germany. He attended school at the Reformrealgymnasium in Blankenese, where he was instructed by Peter Zylmann, a Frisian prehistorian. He graduated there in 1937, receiving his Abitur. After work and military service and escape from imprisonment by English forces, in 1945 he began studies at the University of Hamburg, majoring in pre- and protohistory under Hans J√ºrgen Eggers with minor studies in classical antiquity, German medieval studies, folkloristics, ethnology and geography. After seven semesters in mid-1949 he received his doctoral degree with a thesis titled \\"Untersuchungen zur Eisenzeit in Mitteldeutschland\\" (\\"Investigations of the Iron Age in Central Germany\\"). From 1952-1953, he received a travel stipend from the German Archaeological Institute. After habilitation in 1955, he was a Privatdozent for pre- and protohistory at the University of Hamburg. In 1959 he succeeded Vladimir Milojƒçiƒá as professor of pre- and protohistory at Saarland University in Saarbr√ºcken, where he directed the institute from 1959 until 1985. At his initiative, the institute was renamed the Institute for Pre- and Protohistory and Near Eastern Archaeology. He became a professor emeritus in 1986 and continued his scholarly work until his death in 2014.  Work  He took part in various excavations in Turkey (Boƒüazkale) and Syria (Tell Chuera), and began work on the Tell Kamid al lawz in Lebanon in 1963 together with Arnulf Kuschke, professor for Old Testament studies at the University of Mainz. He directed this excavation from 1966 until 1981. In 1982, he initiated the excavations near the village of Drama in the Yambol Province of southeast Bulgaria together with Jan Lichardus and Alexander Fol, heading the efforts until his retirement. His research covers a broad spectrum in both periods and geography. He authored important works on topics which included the Bronze Age in central Europe and the archaeology and history of Germanic peoples. In 1962 together with Georg Kossack and philologist Hans Kuhn he published a study on the Nordwestblock (\\"V√∂lker zwischen Germanen und Kelten\\"). In 1970, Hachmann published his study Die Goten und Skandinavien, which investigated the origins of the Goths and their presumed original homeland in Scandinavia. In this study Hachmann concluded that it could neither be proven nor disproven that the Goths originated in Scandinavia. He nevertheless noted that the trail of human migration will not always be reflected in the archaeological record.. \\"Eine Wanderung mu√ü sich ja nicht unbedingt im arch√§ologischen Fundgut abzeichnen, und selbst das historisch ganz Unwahrscheinliche bleibt immerhin noch m√∂glich.\\" Hachmann proposed that the Goths originated in the Przeworsk culture, but a later study by Herwig Wolfram has found this assumption to be incorrect. Hachmann continued his work after becoming an emeritus professor at the university. In 1991, he published his studies on the origin and creation of the Gundestrup cauldron. The excavation results from Kamid al lawz were published in more than 20 volumes under his direction in the series Saarbr√ºcker Beitr√§ge zur Altertumskunde. Those whose doctorates he supervised include the former director of antiquities for the Saarland, Alfons Kolling, the mining archaeologist Gerd Weisgerber and Fran√ßois Bertemes, professor of prehistoric archaeology at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. Hachmann was a regular member of the German Archaeological Institute and was also an honorary member of the Romanian Academy from 1993.

The bill failed by a two-vote margin in the House. He joined the required the majority vote to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. He had co-sponsored both measures. He also supported related legislation to ban abortion whenever a fetal heartbeat is detected, to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, and to make a fetal death a felony in certain cases. He co-sponsored legislation to allow leaders of universities and religious institutions to carry concealed weapons. He voted to prohibit the governor from regulating firearms during an emergency.

However, LPXTGase differs significantly from Sortase in several ways: a) it is glycosylated, b) it contains unconventional amino acids, and c) it contains D-amino acids. The latter two characteristics indicate that ribosomes are not involve in the synthesis of LPXTGase. Data suggest that the enzymes responsible for cell wall assembly also assemble LPXTGase. This is the first enzyme of its kind ever reported and was discovered in streptococcal and staphylococcal lysates due to its high cleavage activity for the LPXTG sequence (200x more active than sortase). While there are only three publications describing this enzyme, all from the same source, they are in high quality peer reviewed journals. One reason for this limitation is that there is no single gene that codes for LPXTGase (it does not fit the \\"one gene one enzyme\\" theory) making its manipulation purely biochemical.

They formed in 1996 and released their first recording in 1999. Lead vocalist Won Jong-hee, the only remaining original member, also ran Skunk Label and owned the punk music venue Skunk Hell. They gained notoriety in 2005 when friends of the band undressed on stage during the live nationwide broadcast of an episode of MBC concert show Music Camp. History Rux was formed in 1996 when the punk music scene centered on Club Drug and Crying Nut. The name \\"Rux\\" is synonymous with \\"Ruckus\\". Rux released several songs on compilations and went through numerous personnel changes before releasing the seven-song compilation I Gatta Go. The title refers to conscription in South Korea for all Korean males, which frequently breaks up Korean bands. Following the release, the band went on hiatus from 1999 to 2002 while Won Jong-hee served in the military. =Skunk Label= Won Jong-hee owned and operated Skunk Label, a DIY record label for Korean punk bands founded in July 1998. Skunk Label went on hiatus while Won served his military duty. After Won returned in 2002, Skunk Label released We are the Punx in Korea, a 30-track compilation CD that has been described as the \\"Rosetta stone\\" of Korean punk rock. =Skunk Hell= Under the banner of Skunk Label, Won operated two live music venues, called Skunk Hell. The first venue, located between Hongik University and Sinchon, was an obscure basement venue described as the size of a \\"good-sized living room\\". The second Skunk Hell opened in Hongdae area in January 2004 in the former location of Club Drug. Eventually weekly management of the live music schedule was handed over to Ryu Cheol-hwan of punk band Suck Stuff. At the end of 2008, Skunk Hell officially closed its doors, with Ryu and Won citing waning finances and the inability to secure a liquor licence, as well as market saturation of competing live music venues. Skunk Hell closed its doors and Skunk Label fell out of use, as both Rux and Suck Stuff were quickly signed to Dope Records. Skunk Hell opened in its third location in Mullae-dong in 2015. =Live Music Camp incident= On Saturday, July 30, 2005, Rux was invited to appear on the MBC concert program Live Music Camp for their segment called ‚ÄúIs this song good?‚Äù The band members invited a large number of their supporters in the punk scene. Toward the end of the performance, two punks disrobed and leapt around the stage in front of the live audience and the cameras. Between four and five seconds of full-frontal nudity was broadcast across the nation. The two streakers were mistakenly identified as members of the band Couch, although one was from Spiky Brats. Both were booked by the police without detention on charges of indecency and interference with a business. The police administered drug tests, but the results were negative. Won was also arrested for inviting the two to appear on the show. Public response was furious, both against Rux and the broadcaster. MBC cancelled Music Camp, and the Korean Broadcasting Commission considered heavy disciplinary measures. Then mayor of Seoul, Lee Myung-bak suggested that Hongdae concerts be regulated by authorities, which prompted political rivals to compare Lee to former dictator Park Chung-hee.

He is most noted for his paintings of hunting scenes and the Italian countryside, however his work also includes many representations of Oriental themes. Early life He was born in Livorno into a wealthy family. His father owned substantial lands around Livorno, and the rents were used not only to support his large family, but also to assist those who worked towards a unified Italy. For his support of the rebels, Eugenio's father was forced into exile, taking refuge in the countryside. The boy, Eugenio, acquired his love of nature and animals during this period and developed a passion for hunting. Education and career He first studied jurisprudence at the University of Pisa, then entered a course of study under the sculptor Fazzi from Lucca, a pupil of Carlo Mark√≤ the elder. He moved to Florence to practice law with Leopoldo Cempini, but began to attend courses of painting at the Academy under Enrico Pollastrini. Following his father's death in 1864 he abandoned law, and concentrated on painting. His early work concentrated on portraits of customers, painted inside his studio. However, when the weather was good, he would take to the hills and paint scenes from the countryside. In 1866, he volunteered with other Tuscan artists to fight in the wars of Italian Independence. After that campaign, he opened a studio in Livorno adjacent to Adolfo Belimbau. By the summer of that year, Diego Martelli hosted him to Castiglioncello: where he works alongside Boldini, Bechi, and Abbati. In 1869, he considered himself sufficient as a painter, and began to exhibit some of his works at the Promotrice di Turin. Encouraged by friends and other painters, he exhibited again in 1872 at the second National Exhibition of Milan. The 1872 exhibition was a turning point in his career, as his work gained considerable public and critical attention. Juler, C., Les Orientalistes de l'√©cole Italienne, [French edition], Paris, ARC, 1994, p. 57 In 1873, he moved to Ceppato, near Lari, painting hunting scenes. He became friends with Francesco Gioli and Corcos. In 1875, he travelled to Tunisia with Belimbau. Upon returning to Tuscany, he settled in Torre del Lago, the hamlet which was now a locus for artistic pilgrimages due to the presence of the Villa of Puccini. Following his sojourn in Tunisia, he became interested in Oriental scenes. His experience also changed his perceptions of colour and light. In 1880 he exhibited Cenciaiole Livornesi and exhibited at the International Exposition of Modern Paintings at the societ√† Donatello. In 1881-1888, he exhibited at Florence, Rome, Milan, Bologna, and Turin.Pinacoteca Livorno short biography. Extracted from La pittura in Italia - l'Ottocento.

The two form a begrudging alliance, plotting on having Jeff infiltrate the school and obtain files that would assist them in the lawsuit against Greendale. After meeting briefly with Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) while looking for the files he needs for his case, Jeff is re-united with his former study-group, including Annie Edison (Alison Brie), Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown), Britta Perry (Gillian Jacobs), Troy Barnes (Donald Glover) and Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi), and convinces them that he is working on a way to save the college from the lawsuit. He uses this as a ruse to find out all of the negative things that have happened to each of the study-group members after they graduated (including Shirley's family leaving her due to her business, Britta ending up as a bartender, Annie becoming a drug rep, and Abed's film degree going nowhere); information he plans on using to convince them all to start their own lawsuits against Greendale. Jeff double-crosses Connor, and decides to pursue these new lawsuits on his own. However, Connor alerts the study-group of Jeff's intent. After a confrontation, Jeff is able to manipulate the group into going through with the lawsuit anyway. Jeff soon comes to regret this decision, and after happening upon a holographic projection of Pierce Hawthorne (Chevy Chase in a cameo appearance) in the school's courtyard, speaks with Dean Pelton. Pelton, realizing Jeff is in financial ruin, offers to hire him as a new teacher, to which Jeff reluctantly agrees. Jeff re-unites with the study group and convinces them to drop their lawsuit. They all decide to re-enroll at Greendale and pursue new majors. Production This is the first episode to feature the return of series creator Dan Harmon as showrunner following his season long absence from production. Harmon co-wrote the episode with Chris McKenna, who also returned to show and was promoted to executive producer this season. The episode was directed by executive producer Tristram Shapeero. It also features a guest appearance by Chevy Chase, who had departed the show as a main cast member during production of Season 4. Cultural references Throughout the episode, Abed related the potential reboot of the study group to the ninth season of the medical comedy-drama series Scrubs; Troy later commented angrily on the show's not featuring the protagonist John \\"J.D.\\" Dorian (Zach Braff) for the last four episodes of said season, which also indirectly referenced Donald Glover's upcoming departure from Community. The end of the episode has the familiar Scrubs voiceover (by Braff) summing up the feelings of the characters over a montage of their activities. It later pans out to reveal Abed showing the study group an episode of Scrubs season 9. Reception=Ratings= This episode and \\"Introduction to Teaching\\" was watched by 3.49 million American viewers, and received an 18‚Äì49 rating/share of 1.3/4. The show placed second in its timeslot and sixth for the night. Including DVR viewing, this and the second episode was viewed by 4.33 million viewers, and received an 18‚Äì49 rating of 1.8. =Critical reception= The premiere has received generally positive reviews from critics, with most noting Dan Harmon's return to the series. Morgan Glennon of Buddy TV gave the premiere a positive review, noting the show's change from the fourth season, saying \\"A lot has changed between seasons in the lives of our characters, yet the biggest change is in the writing for the show. Even in the best episodes last year, like \\"Intro to Felt Surrogacy,\\" things still felt just slightly left of center. With Harmon's return, it feels like the ship has been righted back on course and the soul has returned to the proceedings.\\" Verne Gay of Newsday graded the episode an A, commenting positively on Dan Harmon's return and creativity, saying \\"the non-sequiturs, word play, pop culture refs and absolute disdain for anything bordering on sitcom logic are all part of a mad dash through the mind of Harmon, and past all of the stuff he finds so gloriously idiotic.\\" Gabrielle Moss of TV Fanatic gave the premiere a 4.8 out of 5, saying \\"The new season of Community is, thus far, brutally funny and also pretty damned brutal ‚Äì from Jeff Winger's failure as a legitimate lawyer, to everyone's similarly bleak post-Greendale trajectories (Relaxarex!). [...] The show has always pulled no punches about the bleakness of the gang's lives (and life in general), but the darkness was especially notable, [...] with only a few dim sources of real hope. Just like real life!\\" Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.5 out of 10, signaling generally positive reviews, saying \\"I‚Äôm elated to say that ‚ÄúRepilot‚Äù is just the beginning of even better things to come for a show that has been able to successfully rebound in a way few others could pull off.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture commented positively on the show's sense of change, saying \\"Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that Community is building, or rebuilding, toward something big and bold‚Äîthat what you‚Äôre seeing is not so much a revamp as a restoration. Few live-action sitcoms are so aware of their artificiality and yet so singularly alive.\\" David Hinckley of the Daily News gave the episode a more moderate review, giving it a 3 out of 5. He said \\"And while it‚Äôs too early to tell for sure, Harmon does seem to have brought back some of the show‚Äôs earlier spirit. What he‚Äôs not doing is making an overt bid for any new, broader audience. Community seems quite happy to party with the friends it already has. And why not? Community fans may be modest in number, but their loyalty, or something, has convinced NBC to keep renewing the show long after by all normal standards it should have flunked out. So Harmon and company may think they‚Äôre in bonus time anyhow, and they might as well do what they want until someone shuts off the camera.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Repilot\\" at NBC.com * * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Community (season 5) episodes ","title":"Repilot"},{"id":"41534247","text":"Up in the Wind () is a 2013 Chinese road movie directed by Teng Huatao and starring Ni Ni and Jing Boran.

Geography  Jest√§dt lies at the far southwestern foothills of the Gobert mountain range in the Werratal ‚Äì the valley of the Werra River in the Kaufungen Forest ‚Äì and on the north side of the Werra River, 2.7 miles ( 4.5 kilometers ) northwest of Eschwege. This river flows south of Jest√§dt. The M√ºhlbach [ \\"Mill Brook\\" ] runs through the middle of the village to one side of the Werra and the Wehre River empties into the other side in the west- south-west of the village. The neighboring places are Motzenrode in the north, Neuerode in the northeast, Grebendorf in the southeast, Niederhone in the south and Albungen in the northwest. Two main roads running through Jest√§dt are the Landesstra√üe [ State Route ] 3403 and the Kreisstra√üe [ District Route ] 3.  History  Mentioned for the first time in the records in 876, Jest√§dt is one of the oldest settlements in the ancient district of Eschwege. It was originally built as a fortified village to defend a Ford across the Werra River. The village's name, according to Professor Theodor Haas of Fulda, is composed of two words. Klaus P. Andrissen,\\"Jest√§dt\\", Ortsnamen in Hessen [ Placenames of Hesse ], retrieved 2 January 2014. One of them is an adjective, either gahi from Old High German or gaehe or gah from Middle High German, both meaning \\"sudden\\" and \\"suddenly\\", with the connotation of \\"steep slope\\". The other is the word St√§tte, the German word for \\"place\\". Gahesteti or Jestaedt therefore means a place on a steep slope, which describes the actual location of Jest√§dt today. It was spelled as \\"Gestede\\" in 1324 and \\"Jestade\\" in 1414 but its present spelling did not come until 1664. Landesgeschichtliches Informationssystem Hessen [ Historical Information System of the State of Hesse ], \\"Jest√§dt, Werra-Mei√üner-Kreis\\", Historisches Ortslexikon [ Historical Dictionary of the Places ], retrieved 2 January 2014. Wine was already cultivated in the 10th Century in Jest√§dt. The vineyard north of the village might be one of the possessions mentioned in 994 by the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto III, in his deed of gift to his sister Sophia, the Abbess of Gandersheim. \\"Weinberge aus dem 16 Jahrhundert [ Vineyards Since the 16th Century ]\\", Dorfweb Jest√§dt: Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten [ Digital Village of Jest√§dt: Attractions ], retrieved 2 January 2014. It flourished until the 18th Century. In 1738 there were eight wineries in Jest√§dt, all working in the vineyards of the Lords von Boyneburg-Hohenstein. The vineyards, all 165.5 acres ( 67 hectares ) of them, have been preserved since 1978 as a local nature reserve. In the 11th Century, the Werratal was the boundary between the Electorate of Mainz and the Guelph dukes and therefore contested. Jest√§dt itself belonged to the Counts of Everstein but it later passed to the Northeim Counts von Northeim. Its new owner, Otto von Northeim, the Duke of Bavaria, however, died in 1083 before he could take formal possession. His son, Siegfried III, Graf [ Count ] von Boyneburg, finally gained the control of Jest√§dt. In 1410 Bernhard I of the Boyneburg-Hohensteins was given the hereditary ownership and authority of the village of Jest√§dt by the Duke of Brunswick-G√∂ttingen, Otto II. But, at least since 1567, the Boyneburg-Hohensteins had had to work for the Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel ( except for the years of the French occupation ) until 1866, when the entire landgraviate was annexed by Prussia after the Seven Weeks War. During the Thirty Years War, Jest√§dt, like the rest of the Werratal, suffered. At first, because the Lords von Boyneburg-Hohenstein had bought letters of protection, it was left alone by the Imperial armies of Generals von Tilly in 1623 and von Wallenstein in 1625. But, in 1637, when the Croats came, they torched the village, burning 17 houses to the ground, and many of the residents fled to the Eichsfeld. Next came the Swedish and French troops in 1646, when they were withdrawing through the Werratal. In Jest√§dt, they used the village church as their barn for their horses and burned all its benches and pews. It got so bad that, in the church, \\"one could see through the roof and count the stars [ man von unten durch das Dach sehen und die Sterne z√§hlen konnte ].\\" It was just as bad for the residents. In 1638 only one child was born and the next birth did not come until 1643, when twelve more were born.

Schloss Jest√§dt  The Schloss [Castle] Jest√§dt was built on the walls of an old Talburg [ \\"valley castle\\" ], west of the village of Jest√§dt, by Walrab von Boyneburg-Hohenstein between 1558 and 1561 after he retired as a colonel from the French Army. His son Friedrich Hermann von Boyneburg-Hohenstein (1564‚Äì1631) expanded the castle in 1612. During the Thirty Years War, the castle was plundered and destroyed. However it was renovated in 1637 and became the family estate of the Boyneburg noble family. When the Jest√§dt branch of the family died out in 1792, the castle and its surroundings fell to the Lords of Eschwege. The transfer of these properties was confirmed in 1802 with a deed of gift from the Elector of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, King George III of the United Kingdom. Later on, the prison tower and the east wing of the castle were removed. The castle was remodelled for the last time in 1906. The mill, on the south side of the castle, was demolished in the 1960s. After World War II, refugees from Eschwege and their relatives stayed in the castle, but in the 1970s and 1980s, the castle was temporarily uninhabited. The castle was bought in 1990 and restored by 1998. Since 1999 four apartments in the castle are inhabited. In the courtyard, as well as the hall, concerts are held.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to fraud relating to misuse of the state's surplus money. Background Neal graduated from Fayetteville Christian School in Fayetteville in Washington County. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Marketing Management from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. Since 1997, he has operated Neal's Caf√© in a landmark pink building in Springdale, a company launched in 1944 by his great-grandparents, Toy and Bertha Neal and later run by his father, Don Neal. He is married to Cindy Neal. He has two sons, Reagan and Bodie Neal and one daughter, London Neal. He is a member of Cross Church, a Southern Baptist congregation in Springdale. Political life In 2012, Neal won his House seat by defeating Springdale Democrat Inez Yesenia \\"Yessie\\" Hernandez, 2,704 votes (63.5 percent) to 1,551 (36.5 percent). He succeeds Charlie Collins who was moved to district 84 by redistricting. Neal served as the appointed assistant Speaker Pro Tempore to then Speaker Davy Carter. He was vice chairman of the Management Committee and a member of the Arkansas Legislative Council. He also sat on these House committees: (1) Budget, (2) City, County and Local Affairs, (3) Energy, and (4) Judiciary. In 2013, Neal co-sponsored the proposed spending cap on the state budget, but the bill failed by a two-vote margin in the House. He voted to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. He had co-sponsored both measures. He supported related legislation to ban abortion whenever fetal heartbeat is detected, to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, and to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases. He co-sponsored legislation to allow leaders of universities and religious institutions to carry concealed weapons. He voted to reduce the application fee for obtaining a concealed carry permit. Neal voted to prohibit the governor from regulating firearms during an emergency. He voted to prohibit the closing of schools based on a two-year pupil enrollment analysis, but the measure failed in the House. Neal supported the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. He voted to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. Bribery On January 4, 2017, Neal pleaded guilty to conspiring to direct $600,000 in state government funds to Ecclesia College and another non-profit organization in exchange for $38,000 in bribes. He was found guilty and sentenced to one year in home confinement, two years probation, 300 hours of community service and ordered to pay restitution of $200,000. The plea agreement also singles out the president of the college‚ÄîOren Paris III‚Äîas being directly involved with the conspiracy. Paris stated that \\"neither I nor anyone associated with Ecclesia College has ever participated or engaged in any activity to provide money to Mr. Neal or any other legislator in exchange for the receipt of those funds.\\" Also indicted in the case is former state Senator Jon Woods of Springdale and Randell Shelton, Jr., of Alma in Crawford County, Arkansas.

West grew up primarily in Little Rock, Arkansas and later Taylor, Arkansas in extreme poverty, where he attended Taylor High School. He served as captain of his high school basketball team and president of his school's chapter of Future Farmers of America. He participated in Upward Bound at Southern Arkansas University and competed in the National Science Competitions where he was twice selected to represent his state at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. He met then-Governor Bill Clinton and traveled to The United States Military Academy at West Point to compete. He was interviewed by West Point recruiters, but after revealing he had same-sex interests, he was dropped as a potential recruit. West is now openly queer.NewBlackMan (in Exile): DeepDickollective Co-Founder Tim'm West on Frank Ocean His activity as a Boy Scout led him to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) which sponsored his troop. He began attending LDS Church functions at the age of twelve. While being considered for a Mormon mission, he came out to his Bishop, which heightened his existing feelings of rejection and shame. This was a difficult for him, and he contemplated his future, as well as suicide. He struggled with depression and anxiety. He decided to move on to attend college, accept himself, even if uncertain about what his future held. His tireless work as a high school student enabled many opportunities for college, Cornell University and Duke University among others. West enrolled at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina, and used an opportunity while at Duke, to attend Howard University in his senior year to experience and study at a historical black college.\\"The Deliberate Revolutionary,\\" Washington Blade, April 29, 2005. (archive at ) He returned to complete his studies at Duke, and graduated in 1994, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy, with a concentration in women's studies and pre- law. After a few years working as a college admissions officer at Duke, he moved to New York City to attend The New School for Social Research where he earned a Masters of Arts degree in liberal studies and philosophy in 1998, while immersing himself in the spoken word and poetry scene in Brooklyn and Manhattan. He later earned a master's in modern thought and literature from Stanford University. Deep Dickollective/hip hop West traveled to the west coast, enrolling in a Ph.D. program in interdisciplinary modern thought and literature at Stanford University. Shortly thereafter in 1999, he discovered that he had AIDS, so he took an academic break to focus on his health and options for his future. It was during this time that he started youth advocacy work and joined forces in early 2000 with Juba Kalamka, and Phillip Atiba Goff to form the black and queer hip-hop group Deep Dickollective (DDC). West believes the Bay Area, with San Francisco's AIDS activism, and Oakland's Black Panthers, was one of the few settings where DDC could emerge. The \\"idea of pan-Africanism and black nationalism is also kind of working against progay [causes]. It's one of the few places were those two identities converge.\\" DDC was one of the first groups of their kind. They were formed, in part, as a response to the pandemic of HIV/AIDS among queer black men. Curator William Jones booked them as part of his \\"Black Gay Male Radical Performances\\" series at the Black Dot Caf√© in Oakland, California. Their debut recording \\"BourgieBohoPostPomoAfroHomo\\" surprised hip hop and spoken word communities, with a fresh approach to the political and social issues, from a perspective of an increasingly vocal black and queer community. What started as a parodic exercise became an underground, and critical success. West continues to educate on homophobia in hip hop.Tim‚Äôm West speaks at UTD and then Queerly Speaking  Dallas Voice West coined the term homohop but feels that the term should be replaced.Homo Hop is dead, Queer hip hop is the real deal At first it helped organize LGBTQI hip hop artists, but he feels now it serves to separate artists who are fundamentally just hip hop artists. West is featured prominently in the 2005 hip hop documentary, Pick Up the Mic and appears in Byron Hurt's documentary Beyond Beats and Rhymes. Most recently he appeared in a set of documentaries directed by Mario Van Peebles about black manhood and responsibility; Bring Your 'A' Game and its complement, Fair Game? In Spring of 2007, DDC released its final, full-length studio project, On Some Other, on Sugartruck Recordings. The group disbanded in 2007. DDC was a part of The Anthology of Rap book from Yale University Press in 2010. West credits DDC for breaking through the media as queer and black artists, and enabling him to perform as an out LGBT black soloist, \\"We had pretty much remained invisible in the media prior to Deep Dickollective, so the affect was far-reaching.\\" As a solo artist, West released Songs from Red Dirt on Cellular Records in 2004.Songs from Red Dirt\\" The debut provided musical complement to his first book, Red Dirt Revival: a poetic memoir in 6 Breaths (2003).\\"Red Dirt Revival: a poetic memoir in 6 Breaths.\\"Tompkins, Kyla Wazana.

West served as the Department Chair of English and Creative Writing at the Oakland School of the Arts from 2002 to 2004 before relocating to Washington, DC where he taught in the English Department of the Cesar Chavez Public Charter High School. In various capacities, since 1995, West has also worked for College Summit, notably as a high school coordinator in DC in 2006 and 2007, where he helped to the build capacity of high schools to get more of their students into college. He is known for his engaging teaching methods, and has taught on the post-secondary level as an instructor of Writing Pedagogy classes at Eugene Lang College of The New School in New York City, and as an instructor in Stanford University's first-year Writing and Critical Thinking Program. In the 2008 to 2009 Academic Year, West taught in the Department of World Languages and Cultures as a Visiting Lecturer in Ethnic Studies at California's Humboldt State University. More recently, West served as an adjunct professor of English and Philosophy at Houston Community College, and in the summer of 2011, joined distinguished faculty with the Washington National Cathedral Scholars Program where he taught a 6-week blog- based social justice/activism course. In May 2011, West relocated to Chicago, Illinois, where his daughter, Shannon Rose Matesky, a recent DePaul University graduate and well known poet, spoken word artist and performer, lives. He started MyWritingProfessor.com where he serves as the owner and principal consultant, and remains a longstanding advocate for youth. In December 2012, he accepted a position at the Center on Halsted where he was swiftly promoted to serve as the director of youth services through May 2014.Tim'm West and the masculine mystique: In his career as a hip-hop artist‚Äîand now through his work at the Center on Halsted‚ÄîWest has demonstrated that there's more than one way to be a black gay man. Tim'm's desire to have a broader impact on LGBTQ youth and young adults led his interest in Teach For America, who'd just launched its LGBTQ Initiative and was seeking a Managing Director. Given the trajectory of his own struggles as a queer black male in the South and even a suicide attempt at sixteen, Tim'm proudly accepted this position with Teach For America in July 2014; a position he feels bridges his work as an educator with his long-standing commitment to LGBTQ youth advocacy. He relocated from Washington, DC to Atlanta, GA where he serves on the Atlanta-based Programming Board for the LGBT Institute. Tim'm was promoted to Senior Managing Director of Teach For America's LGBTQ Community Initiative and continues to do work nationally to advance safer and braver classrooms for LGBTQ kids and educators.

Retrieved August 8, 2016 grew up in Harlem, New York City, and loved music from childhood, teaching himself to play piano. By the mid-1950s he started writing songs, and also performed in a doo-wop vocal group, the Marquis, which unusually for the time featured a female lead singer, June Bateman (who later married musician Noble \\"Thin Man\\" Watts). In 1956, the group recorded a song co-written by Mack, \\"Bohemian Daddy\\", for the Onyx record label.Mitch Rosalsky, \\"The Marquis\\", Encyclopedia of Rhythm & Blues and Doo-Wop Vocal Groups, Scarecrow Press, 2002, p.375 After the Marquis split up, Mack formed a new group, the Highlights, who included singer Joyce Peterson, but they never recorded. Mack moved to the Bronx but kept in touch with his Harlem friends and continued writing songs. He started writing for, and managing, another vocal group, the Young Lads, featuring lead singer Jimmy Rivers, and suggested that they add a female singer, Joyce Peterson's younger sister Sylvia. The group then became Four Bees and a Gee (for four boys and a girl), and auditioned with several of Mack's songs for Richard Barrett at Gone Records. Barrett renamed the group the Tops, and recorded them on one of Mack's up- tempo songs, \\"Puppy Love\\" (not the song of the same name written by Paul Anka). The song was first issued in late 1958 on the V-Tone label, and then on several other labels credited to Little Jimmy Rivers and the Tops. In late 1961, it was re-promoted and reissued more successfully in Philadelphia, and Rivers appeared as a solo act performing it on American Bandstand, but it failed to make the national charts. In the Bronx, Mack heard a trio of students from James Monroe High School singing, and suggested that Sylvia Peterson join them. Mack rewrote one of the songs he had written for the Tops, \\"She's So Fine\\", originally written about Peterson, and changed the lyrics for the girl group to sing as \\"He's So Fine\\". The group, which Mack renamed the Chiffons, made a demo of several of Mack's songs, which he took to Hank Medress at Bright Tunes, a music publishing company set up by members of the Tokens.John Clemente, Girl Groups: Fabulous Females Who Rocked The World, Author House, 2013, p.102 Jay Siegel of the Tokens later said of Mack's songs: \\"They had the most incredible lyrics; not intellectual lyrics, but just the things that people speak of in everyday language. Most people don't have the talent to write them down as music, but he did.... [Had he lived] he...would have been one of the most successful songwriters of the '60s.\\" The Chiffons re-recorded \\"He's So Fine\\" with members of the Tokens and with Carole King on piano, and it was released by Laurie Records in late 1962, reaching number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the R&B; chart in March 1963. As a follow- up, the Chiffons also recorded another of Mack's songs, \\"Lucky Me\\", but it was unsuccessful. Illness, death and legacy By the time \\"He's So Fine\\" had started to become a chart hit, Mack was already terminally ill with Hodgkin's lymphoma. He died, aged 23, in 1963, by which time the royalties received for the song had begun to raise his family out of poverty. After his death, his mother Louise Mack attended a songwriters' convention at which her son won an award for \\"He's So Fine\\", and in accepting the award on his behalf gave a moving speech. Songwriters Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland, who were also at the event, were inspired by the speech, remembered Mack's name, and co-wrote the song \\"Jimmy Mack\\", with its chorus of \\"Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back?\\".

Early Years Robert F. Borkenstein was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana on August 31, 1912. He graduated high school during the beginning of the Great Depression, and due to other financial issues and constraints he was unable to continue his education in college. He would find employment working in Fort Wayne as a photographic technician, where he developed an expertise in color film leading to his invention of the color camera. In 1936, because of his skills and creativity Borkenstein was hired by the Indiana State Police Criminology Laboratory. Rising through the ranks quickly, Borkenstein when from working as a clerk to Captain in charge Laboratory Services. Throughout his time with the Indiana State Police, he helped to improve the use of photography in law enforcement and assisted in the creation of the polygraph machine. The Breathalyzer While working with the Indiana State Police, Borkenstein developed a close professional relationship with Professor Rolla N. Hager of the Indiana School of Medicine. Hager was working to develop the Drunkometer, which would be the first practical instrument of breath alcohol analysis developed in 1938. However the Drunkometer was complicated and had low reliability, so Borkenstein decided to continue to work and develop a more reliable device. In 1954 Borkenstein created what is commonly known as the Breathalyzer. This version was a more compact, and easier to operate breath test machine, which produced reliable results concerning blood alcohol content. A revolutionary invention that aided the ability of traffic enforcement officials‚Äô to identify and prosecute drivers under the influence of alcohol. The breathalyzer was commercially produced and adopted in law enforcement agencies throughout the country and world. Indiana University During the 1950s, Borkenstein attended Indiana University on a part time basis, earning his Bachelor of Arts in Forensic Science in 1958. During the same year as his graduation from IU, he retired from the Indiana State Police and joined the university faculty as Chairmen of the Department of Police Administration, a newly established department. A unique program during it's time, that also continued to develop during the Borkenstein's tenure. In 1971, Borkenstein became the director of the IU Center for Studies of Law in Action, which went on to offer a reoccurring \\"Robert F. Borkenstein Course on Alcohol and Highway Safety: Testing, Research, and Litigation\\" for forensic science, law enforcement, and criminal justice professionals. In March of 1987 Borkenstein retired, though he continued to hold emeritus titles as both a professor and Director of the Center for Studies of Law in Action. Research Borkenstien was an avid researcher and was very respected in his field. One of his most significant research endeavors was the Grand Rapids Study of 1967-1968, the findings of which supported changing the legal blood alcohol content from 0.1 to 0.08. In light of his achievements, Borkenstein was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science by Wittenberg University in 1963 and an Honorary LL.D. from Indiana University in 1987. Borkenstein was inducted into the Safety and Health Hall of Fame International in 1988. Personal Life Borkenstein married Marjorie K. Buchanan in 1938. The couple had no children. Marjorie preceded her husband in death in December 1998. Borkenstein died on August 10, 2002 at the age of 89. ReferencesExternal links * *Robert Frank Borkenstein at Breathalyzer.org *Robert F.

He was canonized a saint in the Roman Catholic Church in 2001 by Pope John Paul II.Canonization of 5 blesseds Life Birthplace of St. Agostino Roscelli in Bargone, Italy. On 27 July 1818, Agostino was born in Bargone de Casarza, in Liguria, in northern Italy. His parents, Domenico Roscelli and Maria Gianelli, had him baptized the same day out of fear that he may not survive. Despite his early health problems, Agostino would grow into a quiet intellectual, receiving his basic education from the parish priest, Fr. Andrea Garibaldi. These times were brief however, as he would spend a large part of his childhood caring for his poor farming family's sheep in the mountains. During these solitary times, he would fill his hours with prayer. In May 1835, at the age of 17, Agostino attended a parish mission given by a visiting priest, Fr. Antonio Maria Gianelli (parish priest of Chiavari and later bishop of Bobbio). This mission thoroughly convinced him he had a call to the priesthood, a calling that would not be easy considering the poor financial state his family was in. Despite this, he attacked the situation with prayer, which led to financial aid that allowed him to study in Genoa, Italy. One of his benefactors was Fr. Guanelli (Gianelli?) who found him a post as a sacristan and guardian of a church attached to a girls school. He was finally ordained on 19 September 1846. Agostino was shortly thereafter appointed to a working class parish, San Martino d‚ÄôAlbaro, in 1846. He would later move to the Church of Consolation in Genoa in 1854. As a parish priest he soon made a positive impression with his obvious zeal and austerity in life. He spent long hours in the confessional, which developed his deep concern for the youth of the area. The boys of the parish were often tempted into a life of crime, having little to no education. The girls were even worse off, having less education than the boys, and were liable to seek menial work in the city, often being seduced or enticed into a life of prostitution. Seeing a great need for change, Agostino set about forming a new type of job training for girls. He gathered together a group of young women, and with them founded a \\"sewing workshop\\", in which girls could receive practical and professional training as well as Christian instruction. Not wanting to neglect the boys, he would also found a \\"young craftsman\\" institute for them in 1858. He would later go on to establish a residential school to train young women who were in danger of starvation or falling into prostitution because they had no support. In 1872 Agostino began a ministry to prisoners, working especially with those condemned to death. Two years later, in 1874, he was appointed Warden and Chaplain of the new provincial orphanage, Monte dei Fieschine, a post he held for 22 years. During that time he would baptize over 8,000 children, as well as providing care for young single mothers, not condemning them but seeing them as simple souls led astray on account of lack of rewarding work.Agostino Roscelli. Painted by artist Denys Savchenko. Work is exposed at the St. Peter and St. Therese of the Child Jesus Church, Genoa, Italy.He lived in an atmosphere of intense prayer, something that would inspire those around him, and especially his helpers. The women who ran the sewing workshop, known as \\"Roscelli's Collaborators\\", decided their mission would be greatly helped if they were to consecrate themselves to Christ in a more formal way. Agostino was reluctant to start a religious congregation, but was encouraged to seek the advice and approval of Pope Pius IX. Pope Pius IX's reply was simple, \\"May God bless you and your good works\\". This was what Agostino needed however, and he would go on to found the Institute of Sisters of the Immaculata on 15 October 1876. Agostino would induct the first of the nuns a week later, going on to act as their spiritual director. He would oversee the early growth of the order beyond Genoa, and eventually beyond Italy. Till the very end of his life, Agostino would describe himself simply as a \\"poor priest\\", ever humble as to his accomplishments. On 7 May 1902, he died of natural causes in Genoa, Italy. He was 83 years old. Sainthood The road to sainthood started for Agostino on 18 January 1932, when the informative, or information gathering process began. After nearly 50 more years, his cause for sainthood was officially declared on 11 September 1980. Nine years later, on 21 December 1989, Agostino was declared Venerable by Pope John Paul II in a decree of heroic virtues. =Beatification= On 17 May 1995, Agostino was officially declared Blessed by Pope John Paul II.‚ÄúSaint Agostino Roscelli‚Äú.

He was a close associate of its second emperor Li Siyuan, and became particularly powerful during the short reign of Li Siyuan's son and successor Li Conghou while serving as chief of staff (Shumishi). Traditionally, he and fellow chief of staff Feng Yun were blamed for making inappropriate sensitive personnel movements that caused Li Conghou's adoptive brother Li Congke to be fearful and rebel, eventually leading to Li Conghou's being overthrown and Zhu's own death.  Background  It is not known when Zhu Hongzhao was born, but it was known that he was from Taiyuan, either late in the Tang Dynasty when it served as the capital for Hedong Circuit (), ruled by the major warlord Li Keyong, or early in the history of its successor state Jin, ruled successively by Li Keyong and his son Li Cunxu. His grandfather Zhu Wen () and father Zhu Shuzong () both served as officers of the guard corps for the Hedong headquarters. Zhu Hongzhao himself came to serve under Li Siyuan, an adoptive son of Li Keyong's and a major general.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 66.  During Li Siyuan's reign  In 926, Li Cunxu, who had established a Later Tang as its emperor, was killed in a mutiny at then-capital Luoyang. Li Siyuan, who had earlier rebelled against him, quickly arrived at Luoyang and claimed imperial title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Zhu Hongzhao became the overseer of palace technicians (). Later in the year, Li Siyuan's powerful chief of staff An Chonghui became suspicious of both Meng Zhixiang the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and Dong Zhang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), as both Meng and Dong were trusted by Li Cunxu, and Meng had married Li Cunxu's biological cousin, and therefore was trying to find some way to curb Meng's and Dong's powers. As part of An's machinations, he sent the official Li Yan () to Xichuan to serve as Meng's army monitor, and Zhu to Dongchuan to serve as Dong's deputy military governor. Meng, however, soon had Li Yan executed. Hearing of Li Yan's death, Zhu became fearful that Dong would kill him as well. He took the chance, when Dong happened to be asking him to go to Luoyang to make a report, to leave Dongchuan and stay at Luoyang. He became a general of the imperial guards and protocol officer (ÂÖßÂÆ¢ÁúÅ‰Ωø, Neikeshengshi). In 928, he was promoted to be a director of palace affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩ‰Ωø, Xuanhuishi). That year, on an occasion when, after a major policy argument between Li Siyuan and An, Li Siyuan considered letting An retire, but Zhu pointed out that Li Siyuan had considered An a trusted adviser and should not abandon him on the basis of an argument, and therefore, Li Siyuan reconciled with An and continued to have An serve as chief of staff.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Later in the year, Li Siyuan launched a general campaign against the rebellious warlord Wang Du the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), under the overall command of the general Wang Yanqiu. Wang Yanqiu believed Yiwu's capital Ding Prefecture () to have strong defenses and therefore would be difficult to attack directly; rather, he wanted to surround the city and put it under siege, to drain out the city's food supplies. Both Zhu and Zhang Qianzhao (), serving under Wang Yanqiu, claimed that Wang Yanqiu was being cowardly, and Li Siyuan, believing them, ordered Wang Yanqiu to attack. Wang Yanqiu's initial attacks, under such orders, resulted in heavy casualties, and he was then able to persuade Li Siyuan to allow him to resume his strategy of starving out the Ding Prefecture defense. He was eventually able to capture Ding in 929, and Wang Du committed suicide. Also in 929, Li Siyuan sacrificed to heaven and earth south of Luoyang, to signify his status as emperor. During the ceremony, Zhu stayed at the palace to keep it safe. After the ceremony, Li Siyuan gave him the title of acting Taifu (), and made him the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi).There were two discordant accounts of why and how Zhu became the military governor of Fengxiang and his relationship with An, in traditional sources. The New History of the Five Dynasties described the relationship between Zhu and An to be unfriendly, and therefore An always wanted to find ways to exclude Zhu from the imperial administration. (See New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 27.) The Zizhi Tongjian gave the opposite description ‚Äî that because Zhu had continuously flattered An, he was repeatedly receiving important circuit governorships. (See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277.) Neither of these accounts was concordant with the two men's actions or actual events ‚Äî the New History of the Five Dynasties account was difficult to reconcile with Zhu's persuasion of Li Siyuan not to force An into retirement, and the Zizhi Tongjian account was contradictory to the fact that Zhu had never served as a military governor prior to the Fengxiang commission. The more neutral History of the Five Dynasties account, which gives no motivation at all nor any indication of the two men's relationship, will therefore be adopted here. In 930, Meng and Dong, fearful of An's suspicions against them, had allied with each other and rebelled against Li Siyuan's rule. Li Siyuan sent his son-in- law Shi Jingtang to command the operations against the two circuits, but the operations stalled against the two circuits' defenses. An offered to head to the front to review the operations, and Li Siyuan agreed. On the way to the front, An stopped at Fengxiang. Zhu personally came out of the city to bow to him, and housed An inside his own headquarters. He also had his wife come out to bow to An and to present food to An. An, touched by the gesture, stated, \\"Libelers had repeatedly accused me, and I almost could not escape. It was only because His Imperial Majesty saw the situation clearly that I still have my clan.\\" After An departed Fengxiang for the front, Zhu immediately submitted a report to Li Siyuan, accusing An of showing anger to the emperor and stating that he was fearful that when An arrived at the front, he would seize command of the army from Shi. He also sent messengers ahead of An, informing Shi of the same thing. Shi, in fear, also sent messengers to Luoyang asking Li Siyuan to recall An. Li Siyuan therefore did so. When An received the recall and headed back to Luoyang, he went first to Fengxiang, but Zhu, this time, refused to receive him into the city at all, causing An, in fear, to try to head to Luoyang as quickly as possible. Li Siyuan, however, gave him no chance to return to Luoyang, but instead commissioned him as the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) without allowing him to return, and subsequently had him killed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Shortly after An's death, Zhu was recalled to Luoyang to again serve as the director of palace affairs. In 932, he was made the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei), replacing Kang Yicheng ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. By 933, Li Siyuan's oldest surviving son, Li Congrong the Prince of Wei, who was generally considered Li Siyuan's likely heir, had made all of the high level officials fearful of him due to his arrogant and violent ways. Then-chiefs of staff, Fan Yanguang and Zhao Yanshou, whom Li Congrong had threatened repeatedly, in particular, did not want to remain chiefs of staff, and repeatedly requested to be sent out to the circuits. Li Siyuan was initially resistant, believing that they were abandoning him, but eventually relented, allowing Zhao to become military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and naming Zhu to replace him. Zhu initially tried to decline the post as well, but Li Siyuan angrily stated, \\"If people like you all refuse to be by my side, what use was it for me to feed you?\\" Zhu did not dare to decline further, so took his office. Li Siyuan also bestowed the chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () on him. Shortly after Zhu became chief of staff, Feng Yun replaced Fan as the other chief of staff. Thereafter, Li Siyuan became extremely ill, but had not yet named an heir. Li Congrong wanted to force his way inside the palace so that the succession would not be diverted from him, but when he suggested the idea to Zhu and Feng, both were resistant of him. Li Congrong therefore decided to fight them with his army. The imperial guards, however, under orders from Zhu and Feng, as well as Kang (who was serving as a commanding general at that time) and the eunuch Meng Hanqiong, resisted and defeated Li Congrong's army. Li Congrong was subsequently killed. Li Siyuan subsequently agreed to summon Li Congrong's younger brother Li Conghou the Prince of Song, who was then serving as the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), but died before Li Conghou reached Luoyang. When Li Conghou reached Luoyang, the high-level officials, including Zhu, supported him to be emperor.  During Li Conghou's reign  As Zhu Hongzhao believed himself to be the person most instrumental to Li Conghou's enthronement, he tried to dominate the court scene. That caused him to eject Li Conghou's most trusted follower, Song Lingxun (), out of Li Conghou's proximity, to be the prefect of Ci Prefecture (Á£ÅÂ∑û, in modern Handan), despite Li Conghou's displeasure. He and Feng Yun similarly distrusted the imperial guard generals An Yanwei () and Zhang Congbin (), and An and Zhang were sent out to be the military governors of Huguo and Zhangyi (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), respectively, and replaced with Zhu Hongshi () and Huangfu Yu (). In spring 934, Zhu received the greater chancellor title Zhongshu Ling (). Meanwhile, Zhu and Feng also distrusted Li Conghou's older adoptive brother, Li Congke the Prince of Lu, who was then serving as the military governor of Fengxiang, and Shi Jingtang, who was then serving as the military governor of Hedong, as Li Congke and Shi had long served as generals under Li Siyuan and were respected by the imperial army. Due to their distrust of Li Congke, they ejected Li Congke's son Li Chongji (), who was at that time an officer in the imperial guard corps, to be the military prefect of Bo Prefecture (‰∫≥Â∑û, in modern Bozhou, Anhui), and ordered Li Congke's daughter Li Huiming (), who had previously become a Buddhist nun in a temple at Luoyang, to live in the palace so that they would have control over her. These actions caused Li Congke to become very apprehensive. Shortly after, Zhu and Feng decided that they did not want to allow Shi to remain at Hedong for too long, and they also wanted to recall Meng Hanqiong, who had been overseeing the governance of Tianxiong ever since Li Conghou was recalled from Tianxiong. They thus issued a series of orders as chiefs of staff, recalling Meng, and moving Fan Yanguang from Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) to Tianxiong, Li Congke from Fengxiang to Hedong, and Shi from Hedong to Chengde. Despite the seriousness of these orders, no edicts were issued by the emperor. Li Congke, fearing that these moves were targeted toward him, rebelled. The imperial government sent the general Wang Sitong to command the operations against Fengxiang, and initially, it appeared that Wang would prevail, as his siege against Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality almost caused it to fall. However, at that time, a group of soldiers, led by the officer Yang Siquan (), defected to Li Congke, causing the imperial army, to collapse, with most of the army surrendering to Li Congke. Li Congke then took his army and headed for Luoyang, announcing that all who surrendered to him would be forgiven, except Zhu and Feng. Upon hearing this news, Li Conghou panicked and considered surrendering the throne to Li Congke, and Zhu and Feng were not sure how to react. Kang Yicheng, however, who was secretly considering defecting to Li Congke as well, offered to command the remaining imperial forces against Li Congke. Li Conghou agreed. (Meanwhile, Li Chongji and Li Huimin were executed.) Even before Kang's army could meet Li Congke's advancing forces, however, the soldiers began to desert and surrender to Li Congke. Kang himself then did so as well. Upon hearing this, Li Conghou summoned Zhu to try to think of what to do next. Zhu, however, interpreted the command summoning him to be a sign that Li Conghou intended to punish him for his wrong advice, and committed suicide by jumping into a well. The imperial guard general An Congjin killed Feng and delivered Zhu's and Feng's heads to Li Congke. (Li Conghou fled Luoyang, and was subsequently killed by Li Congke's emissaries after Shi also refused to support him.)

Tilghman succeeded Arthur Pierce Butler, one of the school's three founders. During his tenure as headmaster, Tilghman guided Morristown School through a lengthy period of financial turbulence for the school marked by the Stock Market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. He also served as head coach of the ice hockey team. Morristown-Beard School awarded Tilghman its Distinguished Alumni Award posthumously in 2010. Early life, education, and first military service Tilghman was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on September 14, 1896 to parents Henry Ashe Tilghman and Alice Tennyson Merry. His father, Henry, worked as a mining engineer for Cecil Rhodes.All other military veterans among Harvard alumni (H-1838 to H-1926) After attending the Sillig School in Vevey, Switzerland for five years, Tilghman completed his high school education at the Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey in 1915. He then studied at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts between 1915 and 1917 and played on the varsity soccer and cross country teams. Tilghman left Harvard in April 1917 to serve as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Coast Artillery Corps for two years. Returning to Harvard in 1919, Tilghman finished his course of study and graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1920. Later that year, he joined the faculty of the Morristown School as a chemistry teacher. While teaching full-time, Tilghman completed a master's degree in chemical engineering at Columbia University in Manhattan in 1927. Administrative innovation Tilghman adopted an innovative approach to the administration and educational mission of Morristown School. He created a self-help system modeled after the Kent School in Connecticut under which students engaged in service experiences to improve their self-reliance. Students waited on dining room tables, made their own beds, and engaged in supervised activities to facilitate the physical maintenance and daily operations of the school. Simultaneously, Tilghman introduced curriculum advancements that integrated greater lessons in culture and business. He also reorganized the student government and established the school's first alumni magazine (The Morristown School News). Hockey team's barnstorming tour of Europe In 1933, Tilghman took the Morristown School hockey team on a barnstorming tour of Europe during winter vacation, a novel experience for a high school team at the time. Experimenting with the tour, Tilghman sought to bolster the international exposure of his student-athletes. Morristown School's hockey team competed against club and school teams from France, Germany, and Switzerland. William P√®ne du Bois, who went on to earn the Newberry Award as a children's writer, starred as the team's goaltender. Du Bois' experiences in goal influenced the creation of his 1967 story Porko von Popbutton about a boy who accidentally ends up playing goaltender for his school hockey team. The Morristown School hockey team embarked on their journey on the Berengaria, a massive ocean liner run by the British Cunard Line that surpassed the by 24 feet. Setting out on December 16, they received a personal message of good luck from U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt: \\"The President sends them [the players] his best wishes for their success in this new field of competition, and wishes them to know of his conviction that they will live up to the best traditions of American sportsman.\\" During the trip, Tilghman communicated with the Morristown School by cable to share the team's accomplishments. They had a luncheon in England before returning to the U.S. on January 9, 1934 via the RMS Aquitania, a Cunard Line ocean liner that served in both World Wars as a troop ship. Speaking about the team's performance during the trip, Tilghman noted, \\"The team did very well, especially when consideration is given to the fact that it played eight games in seven days and had to take long and tiring trips. The team learned a lot of hockey and should give a good account of itself during the remainder of the season.\\" Hockey team's annual game at Madison Square Garden Tilghman also helped establish an annual holiday game between the ice hockey teams of Morristown School and Kent School. The two schools competed against each other at Madison Square Garden in New York City between 1928 and 1932. They played the first of these rival games just two years after the New York Rangers began play in the National Hockey League. Starting in 1929, Morristown School and Kent School competed for the Ranger Trophy donated by Colonel John S. Hammond, the first president of the Rangers. They switched the venue of their annual rivalry game to West Point's college hockey arena for the games played between 1933 and 1935. . Joint resolution against proselyting of athletes In 1939, Tilghman and his assistant headmaster, Theodore Mayhew, hosted a group of 10 headmasters concerned about the practice of proselyting high school athletes. The schools signed a joint resolution that emphasized four points: * Opposition to proselyting in any form * Intention to make no special efforts to attract athletes to the schools * Opposition to athletic-specific tuition discounts * Subordination of athletics to scholastic work The ten headmasters who signed the resolution represented Carteret Academy, the Kingsley School, Montclair Academy, Morristown School, Newark Academy, the Newman School, the Pingry School, Rutgers Preparatory School, Stevens-Hoboken Academy, and the Wardlaw School. Military service during World War II After Tilghman retired as headmaster of Morristown School in 1939, he joined the U.S. Navy. Tilghman received an initial commission of lieutenant commander in 1940 and served in the color guard for Governor Herbert H. Lehman's trip to the officer training camp in Plattsburgh, New York. That spring, Tilghman delivered the keynote address at the commencement ceremony at Morristown School. In 1941, Tilghman received a promotion to commander. He deployed to the Pacific Theatre of World War II two years later. While commanding a U.S. Aircraft carrier service unit in the Gilbert Islands, he died trying to get other sailors of the way of an out of control bomber. The Navy posthumously awarded Tilghman the Legion of Merit in 1944. Family Tilghman married Ruth Slocum in the chapel at Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia on April 4, 1918. They had six children together: Henry, William, George, Jr., Richard, Anne, and Sarah. Taking after his father, Henry served as a lieutenant and then commander in the U.S. Navy. He also served as headmaster of the St. Bernard's School in Gladstone, NJ (now Gill St. Bernard's School).

She was married to Li Jing (n√© Xu Jingtong, Emperor Yuanzong), the second ruler of Southern Tang and gave birth to Li Yu, the third ruler.

It is not known when Lady Zhong was born, but it was known that she was the second daughter of Zhong Taizhang (ÈçæÊ≥∞Á´†), who was a general of Southern Tang's predecessor state Wu (also known as Hongnong or Huainan). Zhong Taizhang had been instrument in the coming to power of Xu Wen (Lady Zhong's eventual grandfather-in-law) ‚Äî as Xu and a colleague, Zhang Hao, had assassinated Wu's then-prince Yang Wo in 907, but then began to have a power struggle. Xu and another official, Yan Keqiu, then invited Zhong to lead a group of soldiers to ambush Zhang. Zhong agreed and was able to kill Zhang, allowing Xu to take over the reins of the state as the regent for Yang Wo's brother and successor Yang Longyan. However, it was said that Zhong was not well-rewarded for his actions, and, while he was quiet about his resentment, was resentful.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Nevertheless, when Zhong was accused of improprieties in 923, Xu Wen was reluctant to, as his adoptive son, the junior regent Xu Zhigao suggested, punish Zhong, noting to Xu Zhigao his belief that had not for Zhong, he himself would have died at Zhang's hands. Rather, he ordered Xu Zhigao to take a daughter of Zhong's to be the wife of Xu Zhigao's son Xu Jingtong, leading to the marriage.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. It was said that when Xu Wen first saw Lady Zhong, he commented, \\"Only this boy is fit for this girl.\\" During Wu (i.e., during the successive regencies of Xu Wen and Xu Zhigao, although the timing was not clear), Lady Zhong first received successive greater lady titles. She bore Xu Jingtong his first son Xu Hongji, and (later, during Southern Tang) would bear him his sixth son Xu Congjia and ninth son Li Congqian (ÊùéÂæûË¨ô). (His seventh son Li Congshan (ÊùéÂæûÂñÑ) was said to be her son in Li Congshan's biography in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, but said to be the son of his concubine Lady Ling in Lady Ling's biography.)  During Southern Tang  In 937, Xu Zhigao had the Wu emperor, Yang Pu, yield the throne to him, ending Wu and starting a new state of Southern Tang. He created Xu Jingtong (who shortly after was renamed Xu Jing) the Prince of Wu, and then the Prince of Qi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Lady Zhong, as the wife of the Prince of Qi, received the title of Princess of Qi. (Xu Zhigao and Xu Jing, along with the rest of the imperial family (and therefore, including Empress Zhong's children) changed their family names from Xu to Xu Zhigao's birth name of Li in 939, with Xu Zhigao taking on the new name of Li Bian.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. In 943, Li Bian died and was succeeded by Li Jing. Li Jing created Princess Zhong empress.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. It was said that Empress Zhong, although she grew up in an honored household, did not favor entertainment, and did not wear luxurious clothing. Whenever the emperor rewarded her, she would first distribute the rewards to his concubines, and then to the other palace personnel. During the war that Southern Tang's rival Later Zhou waged against Southern Tang late in Li Jing's reign (955-958) that eventually led to Southern Tang's yielding to Later Zhou as a vassal state,See Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 292, 293, 294. Empress Zhong reduced the amount of meals served in her palace, and forbid the playing of music for months. Li Jing died in 961, and Li Congjia, who was the crown prince at that point (his older brothers, including Li Hongji, had predeceased him), succeeded to the throne (and changed his name to Li Yu). He was set to honor Empress Zhong as empress dowager ‚Äî traditionally, Huang Taihou (ÁöáÂ§™Âêé). However, as Empress Zhong's father's name was Zhong Taizhang, that title was deemed inappropriate due to naming taboo.

Although based in Yerevan, Armenia, the College primarily serves the Armenian Diaspora, where opportunities for learning Armenian vary from community to community. AVC‚Äôs mission is to preserve the Armenian identity providing learners around the world the opportunity to receive a full-fledged Armenian education, regardless of their age, country of residence or level of knowledge. AVC also strives to create a virtual learning community that fosters both the cultural education and social communication otherwise out of the reach of students who wish to pursue education in the field of Armenian Studies. As of today AVC has served about 4,000 students from over 75 countries. Students can choose to earn credits for each course that they complete, ultimately leading to a certificate. Also, students may transfer credit from AVC courses to various universities and learning institutes across the world.  History  The idea of AVC was born and the project was initiated in 2004 by Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) Silicon Valley Chapter in order to better address the needs of students who wished to learn Armenian language, history and culture, but were unable to do so due to lack of schools in their location; the project also meant to offer a program in Armenian studies through an innovative approach and new technologies to appeal to present-day students. The inaugural academic term took place in 2009 with courses in Armenian language and Armenian history. Later, AVC multiplied the courses; Armenian culture and chess were added as subjects, and added more languages of instruction. As of today, the courses are available on multiple levels and in seven languages of instruction: Eastern Armenian, Western Armenian, English, French, Russian, Spanish and Turkish. In 2013, a partnership was announced with the University of Granada whereby AVC provides Eastern Armenian language courses to University of Granada students as a third foreign language option. In 2014, AVC redefined the Armenian experience by presenting a new multiplatform media product series-AVC Multimedia e-Book Series covering a wide variety of topics about Armenian history, culture and contemporary affairs. With the release of the Armenian Highland, the first in the series of interactive e-books, AVC‚Äôs expansion in a new direction was marked.

This translation does not differentiate between her title and her mother-in-law Empress Zhong's title of huanghou (ÁöáÂêé; literally \\"empire's consort\\", or \\"empress\\"). In 959, in order to end invasions by the Later Zhou Dynasty, the Southern Tang ruler Li Jing (Zhou Ehuang's father-in-law) relinquished all imperial trappings, including his claim as an emperor. From that point, Southern Tang became a nominal vassal state of the Later Zhou Dynasty and the Song Dynasty which succeeded Later Zhou in 960, and the terminologies used reflected this relationship. Zhaohui (Êò≠ÊÉ†ÂúãÂêé), was a queen consort of imperial China's short-lived Southern Tang state during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Her husband was Li Yu, Southern Tang's third and last ruler. She is best known as Queen Zhou the Elder (Â§ßÂë®Âêé) to distinguish from her younger sister Queen Zhou the Younger whom Li Yu married after her death. A musical genius and pipa virtuoso, she is suspected to be the subject of many of Li Yu's enduring love poems. Biography Zhou Ehuang was the daughter of Zhou Zong, an official to Emperor Yuanzong. She had a younger sister named Zhou Jiamin, who was 14 years younger than her. She studied the book of history, mastered the rhythm of music, and played xiangqi. As a musical genius, she played the pipa for Emperor Li Jing on his birthday, and he rewarded her with a pipa as a present. He married her to his son, Li Yu Prince of Wu. After Li Jing died, Li Yu ascended to the throne as emperor and honored her as Queen. Her younger sister, then 5 at the time, was allowed to visit the palace frequently. As queen, she gave birth to two sons, Li Chongyu and Li Chongxuan. Her younger son, Li Chongxuan, was playing in front of a statue when a lamp suddenly fell down on him. Li Chongxuan was frightened and eventually died of shock at the age of three. Queen Zhou was saddened, and she eventually fell ill. She lamented to her husband about their son, and Li Yu was greatly saddened too. During her last days, Li Yu carried out an affair with her younger sister, who was 14 at that time. Queen Zhou heard about this and died out of sadness. Li Yu was very regretful, and wrote a poem for her. Soon, Queen Zhou's mother in law, Empress Dowager Zhong succumbed to illness. After their funerals, Queen Zhou's younger sister Jiamin became the new queen of Li Yu. Jiamin would be known in history as Queen Zhou the Younger and would accompany Li Yu until his death.

Following amendments to the SOLAS Convention in 1990, Normandie Shipper was listed by the British Department of Transport as one of the ships needing modifications to fully meet the new SOLAS 90 standard. Following the end of the charter, she was laid up at Caen in October 1995. She was then sold to Adecon Shipping Ltd, Bahamas and renamed Bonavista.

She operated the Brevik - Holmestrand - Hirtshals route for a year before transferring to the Hirtshals - Langesund route. On 26 March 2003, Boa Vista collided with the breakwater at Hirtshals. Two days later, she was sold to Trond A Kittelsen Shipping, A/S, Brevik, remaining on the Hirtshals - Langesund route. On 16 June 2004, Boa Vista was sold to Kittilsen Shipping, Panama. She was chartered to HUAL. She was operated by Thraki Med RoRo Lines on the Volos - Izmir route from September 2006. On 3 November 2007, Boa Vista was sold to Thraki Shipping Co SA, Panama and renamed Birlik 1. She was registered to Birlik RoRo Isletmeleri AS, Istanbul, Turkey in December 2007.

Mike. .  Early life and education  Louise Shadduk was born in 1915 in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and raised on a dairy farm in Idaho. Her family had purchased the farm for $700 at the foot of Canfield Mountain, raising vegetables, chickens, goats, and cows. Shadduck drove the family truck as soon as she could reach the pedals, and she and her six brothers took turns driving the family dairy milk truck on its route in the mornings before school. She would perform farm chores and rough-house with her siblings, and also played dolls and helped her mother with the house. She attended Dalton Grade School and high school in Coeur d'Alene in the early 1930s. At one point winning a journalism contest to travel to Alaska, she wrote for her high school newspaper, and was a cheerleader during the Great Depression. In 1969, she received an honorary degree from the University of Idaho. Career=Early career= Shortly after graduating high school she was hired as a writer for the Spokesman-Review, and afterwards the Coeur d'Alene Press. Shadduck was sent to report on the 1944 Republican National Convention by the Coeur d'Alene Press. At the end of World War II, she founded the Kootenai County Young Republicans in North Idaho. Gaining recognition in that organization, she rejected attempts by the Republican Party to recruit her, instead sticking her to journalism. However, when the Press sent her to Washington, D.C. as an intern for Idaho Senator Henry Dworshak's office, she both wrote stories for the paper and also helped the senator. She also joined Robert Taft's inner circle, after being invited after attending a Young Republicans convention in Milwaukee. Returning to Boise, Idaho, she accepted a job from the Governor Charles A. Robbins as his publicity assistant. She was quickly promoted to administrative assistant. She was the first female administrative assistant to an Idaho governor, serving Governor Robins from 1946 until 1950. She left writing for The Press in 1948 but continued to sell freelance stories. The Press published these stories under her \\"This and That\\" column. She continued in that office with his successor Leonard B. Jordan, until 1952 when U.S. Senator Henry Dworshak finally convinced her to come to Washington and work for him. In 1952, Shadduck spoke for Eisenhower's and his \\"I Like Ike\\" campaign, sharing a head table with the future president. She spoke in support of his peace time nuclear policy in a nationally televised speech at the Republican National Convention. In 1956 she made a run for United States Congress, against Democrat Gracie Pfost for the First District Congressional seat from Idaho. It was the first time in United States history where both major parties chose female candidates in a congressional race. During this time she also helped Eisenhower in his re-election campaign for US president. She spoke at the Cow Palace in San Francisco in 1956, addressing the GOP National Convention. =State secretary and lobbying= In 1958, she was the first woman in the United States to be a state secretary of commerce and development, when Idaho appointed her to the position Given five employees and a budget of $140,000, soon after losing 45/55 to Pfost, Shadduck was asked by Idaho's Governor Bob Smylie to take over the state's struggling Department of Commerce and Development, giving her a blank slate to do it her way. Under Governor Smylie, she became the first female head of a department when she created and the ran the organization that later became the Department of Commerce and Economic Development. With an office in the State House attic, Shadduck began a strategy of promotion which included back country horseback and fishing trips with business leaders from other states. She brought major Girl Scout and Boy Scout events to the state, implemented development of Farragut State Park and brought other national conventions to Idaho. Her ten- year tenure coincides with Idaho's per capita income rising to its highest point in the century. Following the defeat of Governor Smylie she became administrative assistant to Idaho's Congressman Orval H. Hansen. After leaving his office she lobbied for Idaho's forest industries and rewrote the timber tax laws to make it profitable for renewable logging on managed private property. Reacting to the arrival of a white supremacist group in northern Idaho, she lobbied effectively for an amendment to malicious harassment laws. That amendment allowed for civil damages to be awarded in cases of malicious harassment and was instrumental in dismantling the supremacist compound. In 1979 she accompanied Senator Frank Church and others on a major trade delegation to China, where she spoke about and promoted cooperation in forestry between the two nations.Idaho Oral History Center: Typed Transcript of an Oral History Interview with Louise Shadduck Published 1995 = Writing and later years = Shadduck continued to write articles for various Idaho newspapers and publications. In 1966 she was president of Idaho Press Women. From 1971 to 1973 she was president of the National Federation of Press Women and spoke in Israel at the World Association of Women Journalists in a program which also included Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.Spencer, Betty G. (Transcript of Oral Interview) National Federation of Press Women Oral History Program. October 25, 1984. In May 2008, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch named her his North Idaho campaign for his campaign to replace Senator Larry Craig. Shadduck wrote five books, Idaho Sheep King, Doctors with Buggies, Snowshoes and Planes, At the Edge of the Ice, Rodeo Idaho, and Idaho Rodeo! Her final book, about Victor Dessert and titled The House that Victor Built, was published posthumously and had a publisher's proof version brought to her deathbed in 2008. An amateur artist, she promoted the arts throughout her life. Shadduck had a reputation for never forgetting a name or a person's story. She enjoyed mentoring young people beginning their studies or careers, and her personal friendships are cited as a source of her political influence in Idaho's history. She remained active with full-time speaking engagements until within several months of her death at the age of 92. Personal life Shadduck never married, with her great-niece stating in an interview that \\"it was because no man could keep up with her.\\" In 2005, she organized a family expedition to Enterprise, Oregon and Joseph, Oregon, where her great- grandfather had led a wagon expedition along the Oregon Trail. She died in Coeur d'Alene after a long illness. Upon her death in 2008, she was survived by ten nieces and nephews.

During the early 1980s, Gardner struggled with homelessness while raising a toddler son. He became a stock broker and eventually founded his own brokerage firm Gardner Rich & Co in 1987. In 2006, Gardner sold his minority stake in the firm and published a memoir. That book was made into the motion picture The Pursuit of Happyness starring Will Smith. Early years Gardner was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on February 9, 1954, to Thomas Turner and Bettye Jean Gardner. He was the second child and the only boy born to Bettye Jean. His older half-sister, Ophelia, is from a previous union. His younger sisters, Sharon and Kimberly, are children from his mother's marriage to Freddie Triplett. Gardner did not have many positive male role models as a child, as his father was living in Louisiana during his birth, and his stepfather was physically abusive to both his mother and his sisters. Triplett's fits of rage made both Gardner and his sisters constantly afraid. In one incident, Bettye Jean was falsely imprisoned when Triplett reported her to the authorities for welfare fraud; the children were placed in foster care. When Gardner was eight years old, he and his sisters returned to foster care for the second time when their mother, unbeknownst to them, was convicted of trying to kill Triplett by burning down the house while he was inside. While in foster care, Gardner first became acquainted with his three maternal uncles: Archibald, Willie, and Henry. Of the three, Henry had the most profound influence on him, entering Gardner's world at a time when he most needed a positive father figure. However, Henry drowned in the Mississippi River when Chris was nine years old. The children learned that their mother had been imprisoned when she arrived at Henry's funeral escorted by a prison guard. Despite both her very unhappy marriage and her periods of absence, Bettye Jean was a positive source of inspiration and strength to her son Chris. She encouraged Gardner to believe in himself and sowed the seeds of self-reliance in him. Gardner quotes her as saying, \\"You can only depend on yourself. The cavalry ain't coming.\\" Gardner also determined from his early experiences that alcoholism, domestic abuse, child abuse, illiteracy, fear, and powerlessness were all things he wanted to avoid in the future. Early adulthood Inspired by his Uncle Henry's worldwide adventures in the U.S. Navy, Gardner decided to enlist when he finished secondary schooling. He was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina for four years, where he was assigned as a hospital corpsman. He became acquainted with a decorated San Francisco cardiac surgeon, Dr. Robert Ellis, who offered Gardner a position assisting him with innovative clinical research at the University of California Medical Center and Veterans Administration Hospital in San Francisco. Gardner accepted the position, and moved to San Francisco upon his discharge from the Navy in 1974. Over the course of two years, he learned how to manage a laboratory and to perform various surgical techniques. By 1976, he had been given full responsibility for a laboratory and had co-authored several articles with Dr. Ellis that were published in medical journals. Marriage and troubles On June 18, 1977, Chris Gardner married Sherry Dyson, a Virginia native and an educational expert in mathematics. With his knowledge, experience, and contacts within the medical field, it appeared Gardner had his medical career plans laid out before him. However, with ten years of medical training ahead of him and with changes in health care just on the horizon, he realized that the medical profession would be vastly different by the time he could practice medicine. Gardner was advised to consider more lucrative career options; a few days before his 26th birthday, he informed his wife, Sherry, of his plans to abandon his dreams of becoming a physician. His relationship with Sherry was detached, in part because he decided to abandon a medical career and also due to differences in their behavior. While still living with Sherry, he began an affair with a dental student named Jackie Medina, and she became pregnant with his child only a few months into the affair. After three years of marriage to Sherry, he left her to move in with Jackie and to prepare for fatherhood. Nine years elapsed before he and Sherry were legally divorced in 1986. His son Christopher Jarrett Gardner Jr. was born on January 28, 1981. Gardner worked as a research lab assistant at UCSF and at the Veterans' Hospital after leaving the service. His position as a research lab assistant paid only about $8,000 a year, which was not enough for him to support a live-in girlfriend and a child. After four years, he quit these jobs and doubled his salary by taking a job as a medical equipment salesman. Prompted by his son's inquiries about his father, Gardner had previously been able to track down his biological father via telephone. With a higher income from his new job, Gardner was able to save enough money to travel to Monroe, Louisiana, where he and his son met his father, Turner, for the first time. Gardner returned to San Francisco determined to succeed at business. A pivotal moment in his life occurred, after a sales call to a San Francisco General Hospital when he encountered an impeccably dressed man in a red Ferrari. Curious, Gardner asked the man about his career. The man told him he was a stockbroker and, from that moment on, Gardner's career path was decided. Eventually, Gardner bought a Ferrari of his own from Michael Jordan. The Illinois license plate of Gardner's black Ferrari reads \\"NOT MJ\\". The stockbroker in the red Ferrari was a man named Bob Bridges. He met with Gardner and gave him an introduction to the world of finance. Bridges organized meetings between Gardner and branch managers at the major stock brokerage firms that offered training programs‚Äîsuch as Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, E.F. Hutton, Dean Witter Reynolds, and Smith Barney. For the following two months, Gardner canceled or postponed his sales appointments, and his car amassed parking tickets while he met with managers. It appeared that Gardner got his \\"break\\" when he was accepted into a training program at E.F. Hutton. He subsequently quit his sales job so that he could dedicate his time exclusively to training as a stockbroker. Then he appeared at the office ready to work, only to discover that his hiring manager had been fired the week before. To make matters worse, Gardner's relationship with Jackie was falling apart. According to Gardner, the police witnessed an incident in which Jackie was running away with Chris Jr. and Gardner attempted to take the child back, but in the process swung Jackie into the garden bushes, which resulted in her being scratched. Gardner was apprehended initially for this incident, but an identity check on his car license plate led them to detain him for non-payment of parking fines. He was taken to jail and a judge ordered that he stay there, for ten days, as punishment for being unable to pay $1,200 in parking tickets. Jackie then took Chris Jr. away to live with her on the East Coast, but she eventually decided not to press charges over the incident. Gardner returned home from jail to find his apartment empty. With no experience, no college education, virtually no connections, and with the same casual outfit he had been wearing on the day he was taken into custody, Gardner gained a position in Dean Witter Reynolds' stock brokerage training program. However, this offered no salary; apart from selling medical equipment that brought in 300‚Äì400 dollars a month in the early 1980s, and with no savings, he was unable to meet his living expenses. Fatherhood and homelessness Gardner worked to become a top trainee at Dean Witter Reynolds. He arrived at the office early and stayed late each day, persistently making calls to prospective clients with his goal being 200 calls per day. His perseverance paid off when, in 1982, Gardner passed his Series 7 Exam on the first try and became a full employee of the firm. Eventually, Gardner was recruited by Bear Stearns & Company in San Francisco. About four months after Jackie disappeared with their son, she returned and left him with Gardner. By then, he was earning a small salary and was able to afford rooming in a flophouse. He willingly accepted sole custody of his child; however, the rooming house where he lived did not allow children. Although he was gainfully employed, Gardner and his son secretly struggled with homelessness while he saved money for a rental house in Berkeley. Meanwhile, none of Gardner's co-workers knew that he and his son were homeless in the Tenderloin District of San Francisco for nearly a year. Gardner often scrambled to place his child in daycare, stood in soup kitchens and slept wherever he and his son could find safety‚Äîin his office after hours, at flophouses, motels, parks, airports, on public transport, and even in a locked bathroom at a BART station. Concerned for Chris Jr.'s well- being, Gardner asked Reverend Cecil Williams to allow them to stay at the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church's shelter for homeless women, now known as The Cecil Williams Glide Community House. Williams agreed without hesitation. Today, when asked what he remembers about being homeless, Christopher Gardner Jr. recalls \\"I couldn't tell you that we were homeless, I just knew that we were always having to go. So, if anything, I remember us just moving, always moving.\\" After Gardner had found a home, he resumed contact with Jackie and had a second child with her in 1985 ‚Äì a daughter named Jacintha. Gardner turned down Jackie's offer for the two to get back together in a relationship, but arranged for Chris Jr. and Jacintha to stay with Jackie during his long hours at work. Career as a stockbroker and entrepreneur  In 1987, Gardner established the brokerage firm, Gardner Rich & Co, in Chicago, Illinois, an \\"institutional brokerage firm specializing in the execution of debt, equity, and derivative products transactions for some of the nation's largest institutions, public pension plans, and unions.\\" His new company was started in his small Presidential Towers apartment, with start-up capital of $10,000 and a single piece of furniture: a wooden desk that doubled as the family dinner table. The \\"Rich\\" in the name was in honor of commodities trader Marc Rich, who had no connection to the company and whom Gardner had never met, but whom Gardner considered \\"one of the most successful futures traders in the world.\\" After Gardner sold his small stake in Gardner Rich in a multimillion-dollar deal in 2006, he became CEO and founder of Christopher Gardner International Holdings, with offices in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. During a visit to South Africa to observe elections around the time of the 10th anniversary of the end of apartheid, Gardner met with Nelson Mandela to discuss possible investment in South African emerging markets. Gardner was planning an investment venture there which he hoped would create hundreds of jobs and introduce millions in foreign currency into the country's economy. Gardner has declined to disclose details of the project, citing securities laws. Philanthropic activity Chris Gardner in August 2007 Gardner is a philanthropist who sponsors many charitable organizations, primarily the Cara Program and the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco, where he and his son received desperately needed shelter. He has helped fund a $50 million project in San Francisco that creates low-income housing and opportunities for employment in the area of the city where he was once homeless. As well as offering monetary support, Gardner donates clothing and shoes. He makes himself available for permanent job placement assistance, career counselling and comprehensive job training for the homeless population and at-risk communities in Chicago. Dedicated to the well-being of children through positive paternal involvement, Gardner serves on the board of the National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI). He is also a board member of the National Education Foundation and sponsors two annual education awards: the National Education Association's National Educational Support Personnel Award and the American Federation of Teachers' Paraprofessionals and School-Related Personnel Award. Awards and honors In 2002, Gardner received the Father of the Year Award from the NFI. He also received the 25th Annual Humanitarian Award from the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women (LACAAW), and the 2006 Friends of Africa Award from the Continental Africa Chamber of Commerce. In 2008, he spoke at his daughter's graduation from Hampton University. In popular culture=The Pursuit of Happyness= Gardner realized his story had Hollywood potential after an overwhelming national response to an interview he did with 20/20 in January 2002. He published his autobiography on May 23, 2006, before becoming an associate producer of the major motion picture The Pursuit of Happyness, directed by Gabriele Muccino and released by Columbia Pictures on December 15, 2006. The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a sign Gardner saw when he was homeless. In the film, \\"happiness\\" is misspelled (as \\"happyness\\") outside the daycare facility Gardner's son attends. The movie, starring Will Smith, Thandie Newton and Jaden Smith, focused on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle with homelessness. The movie grossed $163 million domestically at the box office and over $300 million worldwide, making it one of Will Smith's consecutive $100 million blockbusters. As a result, it earned Will Smith an Academy Award-Nomination for Best Actor. The movie took some liberties with Gardner's true life story. Certain details and events that actually took place over the span of several years were compressed into a relatively short time and although eight-year-old Jaden portrayed Chris Jr. as a five-year-old, Gardner's son was just a toddler at the time. Chris Gardner reportedly thought Smith‚Äîan actor best known for his performances in action movies‚Äîwas miscast to play him. However, he said his daughter Jacintha \\"set him straight\\" by saying, \\"If Smith can play Muhammad Ali, he can play you!\\" Gardner makes a cameo appearance in the film, walking past Will and Jaden in the final scene. Gardner and Will acknowledge each other; Will then looks back at Gardner walking away as his son proceeds to tell him knock knock jokes. In the hope Gardner's story would inspire the down-trodden citizens of Chattanooga, Tennessee to achieve financial independence and to take greater responsibility for the welfare of their families, the mayor of Chattanooga organized a viewing of the film for the city's homeless. Gardner himself felt that it was imperative to share his story for the sake of its widespread social issues. \\"When I talk about alcoholism in the household, domestic violence, child abuse, illiteracy, and all of those issues‚Äîthose are universal issues; those are not just confined to ZIP codes,\\" he said. Gardner was noticeably absent from the movie's premiere on December 15, 2006. He chose, instead, to be the guest inspirational speaker at a Christmas party for JHT Holdings, Inc., in Kenosha, Wisconsin. =Other appearances= Gardner was featured in the Canadian documentary Come on Down: Searching for the American Dream (2004), where he spoke about the American Dream at his office in downtown Chicago. The documentary also featured Bob Barker and Hunter S. Thompson. Gardner also made a cameo appearance in the 2008 comedy film The Promotion, where he played a community leader.

In practical terms a Sankalpa means a one-pointed resolve to focus both psychologically and philosophically on a specific goal. A sankalpa is a tool meant to refine the will, and to focus and harmonize mind and body. In Vedas The concept of Sankalpa was known to the Vedic Rishis. Sandhyavandanam includes Sankalpam and Japa sankalpa as parts of the said ritual. In the Rig Veda, Maya meant both the wisdom of the mysterious power of the will (sankalpa-sakti) that make the gods create the splendour of the phenomenal worlds, and the deceptive or illusory as bringing about realities that lack a certain degree of reality. In matters mundane Bhavana is feelings and also imagination. Kalpana and Vikalpa, the two words derived from Kalpa meaning doing or generating suggest mentation or intellection generally and imaginative creation specifically. The third derivative from the same root Kalpa is Sankalpa i.e. thought, intention, determination or imagination. Ordinarily, the word, Sankalpa, means the resolve to do, that is, to perform to achieve an objective, as a vow or a solemn promise to oneself. Sankalpa also means concept or idea; a concept is an idea. It is the determination or the will in the mind which precedes all actions. It is considered to be creative in character and superior to ordinary thought because it activates the body; it makes one perform a predetermined act in order to achieve a pre-set goal. It means ‚Äì I will be decisive. I will be whole hearted. My growth is certain. I know I will make mistakes, but I will pick up and continue. Such is the attitude of Sankalpa without which no progress can be made. Determination does not take root all of a sudden; it is conception of a deep rooted desire to achieve, to accomplish good intentionally, sincerely and truthfully. In psychology and philosophy  In Indian Thought, Sankalpa has been variously defined as the great delusion, a mental and physical sickness, desire and anger, superimposition, all suffering, all faults, all blemishes, time and space, manifold forms, illusion of the world, universal nature, primal ignorance, numerous differences, nescience, pairs of dyads, all beings and all worlds, the body and such, listening and such, the thought of oneself, and all else as a variety of psychological reflection. Lord Rama wanted to know about the mind which is of the nature of Sankalpa, dwelling in the body, inert and without an independent form. Here Sankalpa means Thought, which is the imagining of an object as pleasing or painful that leads to desire or aversion of the object. Rishi Vasishta explained that the enemy that is the mind rises by virtue of mere Sankalpa i.e. thought, Sankalpa needs to be destroyed to free the mind to dispel delusion, end all forms of misery and experience delight. A sage of the Chandogya Upanishad speaking about the all-pervading power of Will views it in the context of the conflict between Voluntarism and Intellectualism that centuries later Schopenhauer too experienced to conclude that the whole world seems to be filled with the force of will, that motivation, stimulation and mechanical processes are but different manifestations of the same force. Sanat Kumara or Sanatkumara, the oldest of the progenitors of mankind and in the Mahabharata called the eldest born of Brahman identified with Skanda by Chandogya Upanishad, was the teacher of Sage Narada. Towards establishing the primacy of Will, he tells Narada ‚Äì :‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡•ã ‡§µ‡§æ‡§µ ‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ã ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¶‡§æ ‡§µ‡•à ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§§‡§§‡•á‡§Ω‡§• ‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§•‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ö‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§∞‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§§‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Å ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§®‡•Ä‡§∞‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§®‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ ‡§è‡§ï‡§Ç ‡§≠‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§ø ‡•ß :'Will is greater than the Mind. For when wills, one reflects, then he utters Speech, then he utters it in Name. In the Name mantras become one; and in the mantras, the sacrifices become one (VII.iv.1). He explains that Mind is subtler than Speech, the mind should be studied and what is thought, why that is thought about and how thoughts affect speech and actions should be contemplated upon. In case the mental noise i.e. unrest, cannot be quietened then the mind should be filled with the awareness of Brahman, the highest truth. Then, an even subtler force ‚Äì Sankalpa (determination) will become noticed and that is the subtle desire springing from the core of one‚Äôs being and the driving force which is behind the activities of one‚Äôs mind. Because it is not easy to control Sankalpa the activities of the mind go unchecked, it is so because determination is affected by one‚Äôs samskaras, the subtle impressions of our past, and by thoughts, speech and actions which get stored in the citta, the mindfield, and whose storehouse is the unconscious mind where they stay dormant and which stored material affects our determination without ourselves being aware of it. These have to be awakened for nothing is totally unconscious. Contemplation is a facet of our conscious thinking that triggers corresponding samskaras in order to awaken these subtle impressions affecting our Sankalpa and the conscious mind, and prevents control of the conscious mind. It is our power of determination that makes contemplation effective. Contemplation is more powerful than the unconscious mind; he instructs that we should fill our contemplation with Brahman- consciousness by keeping the highest goal in our mind throughout our study of scriptures, our discourses and our reasoning, for the lower knowledge thus gained through worldly sources becomes the means of gaining the highest truth. Study and teaching are merely actions; no one can achieve freedom through actions alone. Knowledge must be made functional, and active knowledge takes life from ichchaa shakti, the unrestricted power of the will. The power of the will, the power of knowledge and the power of action enforce each other. The power of the will is the initial, primordial divine desire which has to be unfolded. Legend has it that Mahasena, who wanted to know - when the external world and the internal world co-exist, then why were noticed differences in time and space between these two worlds, was told that willful determination is either perfect or imperfect, the willful determination untouched by doubt is said to be perfect. The absence of doubt is the ability to hold one thought in the mind to the exclusion of all others, there is actually no difference. In Yoga In the Yoga System, Sankalpa is the forerunner of any penance. In order to achieve a particular motive and to achieve a particular aim a specific resolve in the form of penance is necessary which should be accompanied by Sankalpa. The daily practice of Sankalpa Mudra is recommended to make that resolve firm and specific. Then the body and the mind becomes charged with special waves that make a person self-confident, resolute and motivated. The practice of Yoga-Nidra allows the Sankalpa to go very deep in one‚Äôs psyche. Sankalpa is a call to awakening. It makes one able to direct consciousness through the chakras.

Statue of Edward Parker Charlesworth, in the grounds of The Lawn, Lincoln Life He was son of John Charlesworth, rector of Ossington, Nottinghamshire, and was brother of John Charlesworth, the father of Maria Louisa Charlesworth. After a pupilage with Dr. Edward Harrison of Horncastle, he went to Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. in 1807. Charles settled at Lincoln, where he acquired a large practice, and became physician to the Lincoln county hospital. He died of paralysis, on 20 February 1853. Thomas Milnes made a statue of Charlesworth for Lincoln Asylum. Psychiatric practice From 1820 Charlesworth was visiting physician to the Lincoln Asylum for the Insane. It was housed in a new building, completed in 1819, and was an independent institution, sharing its medical staff with the County Hospital. Knowing Harrison's private asylum and its highly coercive methods of treating the insane, Charlesworth secured the issue of an order forbidding attendants to use medical restraint or violence without the consent of the directors. He supervised the structure and arrangements of the asylum, and secured in 1821 a classification of patients and opportunities for their exercise in the open air. In 1828 he obtained an order for the display of instruments of restraint, the destruction of some, and record-keeping of cases of coercion. While a house surgeon named Hadwen was in office in 1834, for some weeks no patient was under restraint in the asylum. Robert Gardiner Hill was house surgeon from 1835 onwards, and mechanical restraint was practically abolished there. Influence The experience of the Lincoln asylum influenced John Conolly in his abolition of restraint at Hanwell Asylum. Hill later claimed priority for the approach, and the matter of attribution of influence remained disputed. Conolly visited the York Retreat and the Lincoln asylum, and William Alexander Francis Browne had by then published on non-restraint. Works In 1828 Charlesworth published Remarks on the Treatment of the Insane. Family Charlesworth married a daughter of Dr. Rockcliffe of Horncastle.

A chocolate-strawberry crumble ball. Indian confectionery desserts (known as mithai, or sweets in some parts of India). Sugar and desserts have a long history in India: by about 500 BCE, people in India had developed the technology to produce sugar crystals. In the local language, these crystals were called khanda (‡§ñ‡§£‡•ç‡§°), which is the source of the word candy. A dessert is typically the sweet course that concludes a meal in the culture of many countries, particularly Western culture. The course usually consists of sweet foods, but may include other items. The word \\"dessert\\" originated from the French word desservir \\"to clear the table\\" and the negative of the Latin word servire. There are a wide variety of desserts in western cultures, including cakes, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, and candies. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its natural sweetness. Many different cultures have their own variations of similar desserts around the world, such as in Russia, where many breakfast foods such as blini, oladyi, and syrniki can be served with honey and jam to make them popular as desserts.

He designed aircraft for various aviation companies in the United States and also designed prototype and experimental airplanes. He was known as an innovative aircraft designer. He later worked in partnership with Ole Fahlin. Swanson started designing airplanes while in his teens and by the time he was in college he had designed his third airplane. He founded the Swanson Aircraft Company Inc. and became its chief engineer and president. While working for his own company he designed and built the Swanson W-15 Coupe. He has been described as a \\"brilliant man of great capabilities and extreme modesty\\". Career Swanson designed and constructed, his first home-built airplane in 1915 when he was 17 years old which was a one-person monoplane which could have been retroactively named the SS1. At age 19 he designed and built his second airplane, a one-person biplane, which could have been retroactively called the SS2. In 1922, while a college student, he designed his third aircraft, the biplane SS3, standing for \\"Swanson Sport\\", featuring fuselage made of wood and monocoque design and using a two-cylinder Lawrance engine. He also designed the Kari-Keen 90 Sioux Coupe and the Arrow Sport. These airplanes featured the characteristic Swanson cantilever wing design. The Swanson planes also shared a similar seating configuration; the two-passengers were seated beside each other. =Lincoln-Standard Airplane Co.= In 1923, Swanson had already graduated from the Aeronautical Engineering School at Vermillion, South Dakota and joined the Lincoln-Standard Airplane Co. previously known as the Nebraska Aircraft Company. He worked there as chief engineer replacing their previous chief engineer, Timm. Swanson in his new role at Lincoln-Standard designed completely new aircraft. In addition, in consultation with Harold K. Phillips, superintendent of maintenance at the company, he designed a new small airplane, the Lincoln Sport, which was a single seater and was based on his earlier design the Swanson Sport. =Arrow Aircraft Co.= In 1925 Swanson left Lincoln-Standard and was hired at Arrow Aircraft Company in Havelock, Nebraska. At Arrow he designed a five-passenger plane, the Arrow 5. He also designed the Arrow Sport A2-60 which was built in 1926. In February 1929 the plane was certified as A2-60 and its price was set in the range of $2,900-3,485. The structural integrity of the airplane frame was very good and the fact that the pilot and passenger were seated beside each other, the view from the cockpit and the fact that it had controls for both passengers made the plane popular, as a trainer, among pilots. It also featured the trademark cantilever wings of Swanson's design. By 1931, approximately 100 planes had been built but due to the Great Depression the market for recreational airplanes collapsed and the manufacturer went into receivership in 1940. An Arrow Sport Model A2-60 with serial number 341 is on exhibit at the Smithsonian. =Kari-Keen= Swanson's design of the Kari-Keen Coupe monoplane incorporated his trademark seating of two people alongside each other and was an unusual design at the time. Following the first version of the Kari-Keen Coupe, Swanson designed the Kari-Keen 90, an improved version. But the Kari-Keen factory fell victim to the Great Depression and by early 1930 it closed its doors. Swanson did not wait for long and left Kari- Keen to devote his time to the design of his Swanson Coupe W15, which has been described as \\"beautiful\\". =Swanson Aircraft Co.= In 1931, after he left Kari-Keen, Swanson established the Swanson Aircraft Co. Inc. with headquarters at Hopewell, Virginia, and built the Swanson Coupe W15 whose design incorporated new breakthroughs such as a new type of patented wing structure which enabled unobstructed view from the cockpit to both pilot and passenger even from above their heads. This was done by eliminating an extra wing span which used to obstract the ceiling of the cockpit and limit overhead vision. Swanson did not have any commercial success with his Swanson Coupe. He subsequently decided to dissolve his aircraft company and go to the midwest to join the aircraft company of his friend Ole Fahlin. The Swanson Coupe became the basis of the first airplane produced jointly by them, the Fahlin SF-1, which in turn was the precursor of the Swanson-Fahlin SF-2 Plymocoupe. =Fahlin Aircraft Co.=SF-1 Swen Swanson designed and built along with Fahlin the first airplane of their partnership, the SF-1, which stood for Swanson-Fahlin Model 1. The design and performance of the SF-1 was very successful. The plane was built in the facilities of the Nicholas-Beazley Airplane Company, which had provided working space for Fahlin at their Marshall, Missouri plant. A reviewer, writing for the Western Aviation magazine, praised the performance of the Swanson-Fahlin SF-1 writing in 1934: \\"Having ridden in the new ship built by Swanson & Fahlin, I wish to say that it is the nicest little ship I have ever flown\\". The SF-1 was one of the earliest examples of an American airplane designed specifically to accommodate the Pobjoy engine. Plymocoupe In 1935, following a competition called by the Bureau of Air Commerce, seeking design and construction proposals for an airplane affordable by the masses, Swanson designed the aircraft, and Fahlin designed the propeller and produced the Fahlin SF-2 Plymocoupe which utilised the engine of a 1935 Plymouth which also featured design accents, both interior and exterior, borrowed from the same car. After flight testing by the Bureau, the Swanson-Fahlin plane design did not win the competition. The Plymocoupe was classified as a \\"flying automobile\\" because it utilised the engine of the 1935 Plymouth car. The Plymocoupe design also used many components borrowed from the car including the dashboard and the indicators. Death Swanson died in February 1935 of pneumonia while still building the Swanson-Fahlin SF-2 Plymocoupe. After his death, the airplane was named the Fahlin SF-2 Plymocoupe. Literature Swanson is mentioned in Jerry Sloniger's 2005 book 1924: Flying Capone's Booze, where he appears as the chief engineer of the Lincoln-Standard Airplane Company.

His father, James Faulkner, had emigrated from Ireland,WV bio and served as an artillery commander defending Norfolk during the War of 1812, alongside Elisha Boyd, whose daughter would marry this Faulkner.William Thomas Doherty, Berkeley County, U.S.A.: a bicentennial history (Parsons Printing Company 1972) p. 94 Although both his parents died when he was still a child, C. J. Faulkner graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. in 1822, studied law and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1829. He married Mary Wagner Boyd, the daughter of Elisha Boyd, and received \\"Boydville\\" as part of his dowry. They had three daughters and a son of the same name, Charles James Faulkner (1847-1929), who like his elder brother E. Boyd Faulkner (1841-1917) became Confederate officers and later politicians, diplomats and judges.Evans pp. 196, 202Congressional Biographical Directory, \\"Charles James Faulkner, Virginia\\" Career Faulkner practiced law, farmed using enslaved labor, and sought to develop Berkeley County. A fervent Whig and friend of U.S. Senator Henry Clay (who would visit the district many times), Faulkner advocated internal improvements (including the National Road and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal which passed through Martinsburg). He also owned slaves and was a member of the American Colonization Society. In the 1860 census, he owned $100,000 in real estate and $150,000 in personal property, including 13 slaves in Berkeley County.1860 U.S. Federal Census for Berkeley County, Virginia family 2029; 1860 U.S. Federal Census for Berkeley County, Slave Schedules =Politician= Berkeley County voters first elected Faulkner one of their representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1829 and he would win election (and also lose several elections) in the ensuing decades.Cynthia Miller Leonard (ed), The General Assembly of Virginia 1619-1978: A Bicentennial Register of Members (Richmond, 1978) pp. 348, 359, 363, 367 In his initial speech, he advocated gradual emancipation.http://www.wvculture.org/history/government/faulknercharlesobit.html Faulkner was also soon appointed a commissioner concerning the boundary dispute between Virginia and Maryland.Pulliam 1901, p. 105 In 1838, voters in Berkeley, Morgan and Hampshire Counties elected Faulkner to the Virginia State Senate and he won re-election in 1841.Leonard p. 387, 391, 395, 399, 403, 407 In 1848 Faulkner again won election to the House of Delegates.Leonard, p. 430 There, he introduced a law which became a model for the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.New International Encyclopedia* In 1850, Faulkner was elected to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850, as one of four delegates elected from the northern Valley delegate district made up of Berkeley County and neighboring Jefferson and Clarke Counties. He served with William Lucas, Dennis Murphy and Andrew Hunter,Leonard, p. 441 and was especially vocal in extending suffrage and advocating more equitable tax adjustment, since taxing slaveowners less than their slaves' worth (and adding nonvoting slaves when proportioning the legislative seats) naturally meant more of the tax burden was placed on non-slaveowners and people in the western counties.Evans p. 87 Faulkner was also elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1850, and he won re-election several times, serving from 1851 to 1859. He entered Congress as a Whig, but with the demise of that party, he was re- elected as a Democrat, which he remained for the rest of his Congressional career. There, Faulkner served as chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs from 1857 to 1859.Congressional Biographical Directory, \\"Charles James Faulkner, Virginia\\" =Diplomat and soldier= President James Buchanan appointed Faulkner Minister to France in 1860. He served until the onset of the American Civil War, newly elected President Abraham Lincoln having replaced him with William L. Dayton. When Faulkner returned across the Atlantic Ocean to settle matters in Washington D.C., he was arrested in August 1861 on charges of negotiating sales of arms for the Confederacy while in Paris, France. Initially imprisoned in Washington, a prisoner exchange was contemplated of Faulkner for Henry S. McGraw, formerly Pennsylvania's state treasurer and imprisoned in Richmond while seeking to recover the corpse of Col. Cameron, but McGraw was released and Faulkner instead transferred to Fort Warren in Boston Harbor. An exchange was then contemplated for Alfred Ely, a New York congressman who captured at the First Battle of Bull Run, but Confederate President Jefferson Davis wanted to make Faulkner's arrest an example before the civilized world. Union forces allowed Faulkner a 30-day parole to plead his case in Richmond, whereby Davis reluctantly consented and Faulkner was formally released in December and allowed to return to Martinsburg.Congressional Biographical Directory, \\"Charles James Faulkner, Virginia\\"Evans p. 174 Days after his release, Faulkner enlisted in the Confederate Army and was appointed lieutenant colonel and assistant adjutant general on the staff of General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson.Congressional Biographical Directory, \\"Charles James Faulkner, Virginia\\"Krick, 2003, p. 125. Some of the troops in the Stonewall Brigade were from Berkeley County; Martinsburg changed control ten times during the conflict (30 months under Union governance and 16 months under Confederate governance). His two sons had already become Confederate States Army officers, leaving his wife and daughters to run Boydville. In July 1864, his wife stood up to a Union officer charged with burning Boydville as Faulkner's property, as Union troops had with fellow rebel Andrew Hunter's home in Charles Town and A.R. Butler home's in Shepherdstown. She protested that it was her property, and constructed by her father, a hero of the War of 1812, and her Union-allied nephews Edmund B. Pendleton and E. Boyd Pendleton backed her up. Thus, the house was spared.Evans pp. 263-264 =Postwar= Faulkner returned but refused to take an oath of allegiance to the United States after the war, and only regained his law license after considerable difficulty. Railroads became his clients, since the railroads through Martinsburg needed rebuilding, and various railroad lines reorganized. Faulkner also successfully argued on behalf of West Virginia before the U.S. Supreme Court in Virginia v. West Virginia, which was decided in 1871 and led to Berkeley and Jefferson counties remaining in West Virginia. However, other litigation (concerning allocating the cost and lost subsidies of canal, bridge and railroad improvements in western Virginia devastated by the war) would extend decades after Faulkner's death. Berkeley County voters elected Faulkner as a member of the West Virginia Constitutional Convention in 1872, and he served as the temporary chairman. Berkeley County voters would reject the final result, but the constitution was adopted by West Virginia as a whole; one matter of particular concern was organization within counties‚Äîunder an elected Sheriff, Circuit Judges or Commissioners (the Ohio system)--which some condemned as a hodgepodge.Doherty, pp. 202-206 The U.S. Congress removed his political disabilities by special legislation. He proved a voice of restraint in that convention, as some ex- Confederates tried to undo the 1863 Constitution (modeled on Ohio's) as too \\"Northern\\".WV bio p.232 In 1877, Faulkner commanded the state militia in an attempt to quell a rail worker protest over pay cuts in Martinsburg, West Virginia, under the direction of Governor Henry M. Mathews. A skirmish ensued, resulting in shots fired on both sides and one death. The governor ultimately called for federal troops to restore order. However, by this time the protests had spread to become the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.Bellesiles, Michael A. (2010). \\"1877: America's Year for Living Violently.

Faulkner won election back to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from West Virginia in 1874, serving from 1875 to 1877. However, he lost his attempt to become a U.S. Senator from the new state in 1876. He was also mentioned as a gubernatorial candidate in 1880. Afterward, Faulkner resumed practicing law until his death.Congressional Biographical Directory, \\"Charles James Faulkner, Virginia\\" Death Charles J. Faulkner died at the family estate, \\"Boydville\\" near Martinsburg on November 1, 1884.Obituary of Charles J Faulkner He was interred in Old Norborne Cemetery in Martinsburg WV.

The Works Progress Administration constructed the park between 1936 and 1939. Before the park's creation, Grant had no public parks other than a public swimming pool and softball field; recognizing a need for additional recreation facilities, the city's Garden Club convinced the Village Board of Trustees to approve a public park in 1935. . The main feature of the park is an arched concrete band shell. The band shell hosted free concerts from its construction through the 1960s. Thirty concrete and wood benches provide seating for spectators at the band shell. A concrete fountain, now used as a flower bed, is located in front of the band shell's stage. The park also includes two stone entrances: an arched main entrance at its southeast corner and a walled southern entrance leading to a tiered rock garden. Recreational facilities at the park include tennis courts and a swimming pool, the latter of which was added in the 1960s. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1996.

Susan Cobb Milton Atkinson (1860‚Äî1942) was influential in promoting education to women in Georgia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As the wife of William Yates Atkinson, the Governor of Georgia from 1894 to 1898, she used her position as the state First Lady to advocate for state funding for women to attend college. After her time at Georgia College, she went into the insurance business. In her later life, Atkinson served as the postmistress in Newnan‚Äîa title bestowed upon her by President Theodore Roosevelt himself.  Early life and education  Susan was born in Greenwood, Florida. She was the granddaughter of Florida governor John Milton, so Susan was exposed at a young age to the life of politics. She attended the Lucy Cobb Institute for college, where she also met her husband.  Georgia College & State University  Susan Atkinson was encouraged by one of her friends, Julia Flisch, to help open another college for women in Georgia. In 1889, Atkinson created a petition for the state of Georgia to open a college, so her husband presented a bill to the House of Representatives that finally passed. After Milledgeville was selected as the site for the college, it was founded in 1890 as Georgia Normal and Industrial College. The school's name was later changed to Georgia State College for Women and then finally to Georgia College & State University. When the college was founded, William was named Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and Susan became the President of the Board of Visitors.  Personal life and legacy  Susan Cobb Milton married William Yates Atkinson in 1880. She was widowed when William died in 1899. The Atkinsons had six children together. One of their sons, William Yates Atkinson Jr., became a justice of the Georgia Supreme Court. Georgia Normal and Industrial College honored the Atkinsons by naming a building in their honor. Atkinson Hall is now the building for the School of Business at Georgia College.

M. Hagemeijer is a Dutch ecologist and author who publishes about birds and about wetlands. In 1997 Hagemeijer authored The EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds.  Studies of avian influenza  In 2005, while working as an ecologist with Wetlands International (Wageningen, Netherlands), Hagemeijer was quoted in the press responding to fears of a widespread outbreak of H5N1 influenza. In September of that year, in response to observed outbreaks in Romania and Turkey, Hagemeijer hypothesized further spread of the disease: \\"The next step we expect the virus to take is into Africa, because that is on the main migratory route for birds. The first birds are already in east Africa.\\" By December of that year, as events unfolded, he was quoted widely in the Associated Press: \\"There is more and more evidence building up that wild migratory birds do play some role in spreading the virus, but personally I believe ‚Äî and others agree ‚Äî that it's not a major role. If we would assume based on this evidence that wild birds would be a major carrier of the disease we would expect a more dramatic outbreak of the disease all over the world.\\" An alternative hypothesis was that the virus was specialized to spread rapidly in domestic poultry. In Hagemeijer's opinion, a February 2006 outbreak in Nigeria was more likely caused by shipment of domestic poultry than transmission in the wild, because key areas along the flight path such as the Nile delta seemed to have been skipped over. Ward went on to publish five scientific papers in 2007 and 2008 detailing his observations of H5N1 and H5N2 avian influenza in wild bird populations.

He entered Seisho High School, and played in a Japan-US friendly match during his 2nd year, along with Taishi Nakagawa and Koji Fukutani.

Upon entering Soka University, he participated in the finals of the New Tokyo University Baseball League as a substitute to the team's ace who injured his left elbow, and beat soon-to-be Giants pitcher Tomoyuki Sugano of Tokai University. In his sophomore year, he became the team's ace pitcher. He came upon Nolan Ryan's Pitcher's Bible, and he will be quoted later on that reading the book prompted him to change his pitching form. He showed further promise when he established a new league ERA record of 0.12 in his 3rd year, and became the 8th pitcher in league history to achieve a no-hit no-run in his senior year. Ever since he developed his new pitching form, he went on a 21-game winning streak without injuries.

His second win came a week later, when he pitched 7 innings against the Chunichi Dragons without surrendering any runs, and gave up only a single hit to Hector Luna. By mid- season, he pitched his first shutout win, and became the first rookie in franchise history to record his seventh victory before the end of June. He again tossed another shutout a few days later. His pitching prowess showed no signs of stopping when he became the 2nd Swallows pitcher, and the 8th rookie pitcher in NPB history to record a win during the All-Star Series. He then went on a 7-game winning streak (the first Swallows rookie to do so), and his win tally already reached 12 by early August. Even though the Swallows finished in the rear, Ogawa gave the fans a reason to celebrate in what has otherwise been a very disappointing season. He led the Central League in wins, going 16-4 with a 2.93 ERA in 26 appearances, and received the 2013 Rookie of the Year award. By December, he still kept on breaking the record books when the Swallows gave him a 44 million yen raise, to make 56 million yen on 2014. This was the highest salary for a Yakult player after their first year, beating Ryo Kawashima's 42 million in 2004. 2014 He started the year by giving the Swallows their first victory on the March 28 opening day match against the Baystars. On April 11, despite being charged with a balk while trying to do a pickoff to third, he held the Baystars at bay and notched his 3rd straight win. With this, he became the first Swallows pitcher in 44 years to win 3 consecutive starts since starting the opening day(since Hiromu Matsuoka in 1970). Unfortunately, his winning streak came to a halt when a batted ball struck his right hand during a game against Hanshin on the April 18, where he also gave up 4 runs. He was diagnosed with a fracture in his right hamate hook bone and was taken off the active roster 2 days later. He underwent rehabilitation for 2 months and returned on July 12, but he surrendered 5 runs to the Baystars and once again earned the loss. He managed to get his game back on his next outing however, when held the Carps scoreless for 7 innings. Playing Style His unusual pitching form, most notably his leg kick, earned him the nickname \\"Ryan\\" for it was fashioned after the style MLB Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan. Listed at 171 cm (5 ft 7 in), he may lack the advantage of having longer limbs for extra power, but his form has a slower rhythm to it, making his pitches more difficult to time. With an overhand delivery, he throws a four-seam fastball typically at high-80s mph (tops out at 150 km/h or 93 mph). He can throw decent two-seamers and cutters, sliders, and forkballs. Personal Info Ogawa enjoys reading at cafes on his day off. He likes Italian food and wine. In 2014, he admitted to eating ice cream at least three times a week. He skipped on his favorite desert and fried foods during the off-season and dropped his weight from 80 to 78 kilograms. He also lowered his fat percentage by two points to sixteen percent.

It is set to the tune of the Dad's Army theme tune, Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler? The song was released to coincide with the 2006 FIFA World Cup.  History  The song was created as part of a competition run by The Sun to determine their official World Cup song. \\"Who Do You Think You Are Kidding Jurgen Klinsmann?\\" was selected as the winner. The song was first broadcast on 26 May 2006 on BBC Radio 2 on Chris Evans Drivetime. The song was performed by Tonedef All Stars with boxer Frank Bruno, 1966 World Cup winners Sir Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, and Bill Pertwee, who played Warden Hodges in Dad's Army.  Reception  The song was initially popular, with music journalists and bookmakers suggesting it would chart higher than the official world cup song, World at Your Feet by Embrace. Embrace member, Danny McNamara said that the song was \\"brilliant\\" and thought that it might beat Embrace in the charts. The song debuted in the UK Singles Charts at 13, behind World at Your Feet at 3. It spent four weeks in the charts, failing to improve on its initial 13th position after dropping to 27 in its second week. Despite being popular with England fans, the song was not universally liked. Stylus Magazine called it \\"charming xenophobia\\", with it being suggested that The Football Association didn't like it because of the references to the war. The German national football team manager, J√ºrgen Klinsmann reportedly did not like the song because he disliked the connection that the song was comparing him to Adolf Hitler. Tony Christie, a singer with an entry in the competition, said that while he thought the video was \\"very good\\", he felt the change from \\"Hitler\\" to \\"Klinsmann\\" was unwise and suggested that people should \\"steer clear\\". Manchester Evening News criticised the performers, calling them \\"just a few celebrities on a karaoke machine\\"; however, they also stated that the song was \\"infuriatingly catchy\\".

It is based on actual events involving Radio Alice, a 1970s pirate radio which was politically aligned with the autonomism movement. It entered the competition at the 61st Venice International Film Festival, in which Tommaso Ramenghi and Marco Luisi won the Marcello Mastroianni Award. The Wu Ming collective is also credited as co-writers of the screenplay. The film is published under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license, and can be downloaded from Archive.org Plot  1976, Bologna. Radio Alice is the radio of the movement: fantasy, refusal of wage labor, sexual freedom and cultural provocations. The radio, located in via del Pratello, is kept under control by the police, even if Lieutenant Lippolis is convinced that it is not worth wasting time on what he defines as a bunch of unrealistic, artistic and drug addicted students. A world foreign to law enforcement and \\"good citizens\\", but also to the majority of young people from the suburbs. Like those of Safagna, on the eastern outskirts. Two boys in their twenties, Sgualo and Pelo, can only dream of a way out of the gray and oppressive everyday life. They hang out in the neighborhood bar and sometimes to remedy the chronic lack of money they do some \\"jobs\\" for a local fence, Marangon. This time, however, Marangon offers them something different: dig a tunnel underground in the center. Objective: the Savings Bank in Piazza Minghetti. The two, not without hesitating, accept the risky undertaking. But working tired, and to liven up the long night hours of \\"work\\", the two bring a radio into the tunnel. Against all logic, they find a station: Radio Alice. The \\"creative flow\\" of the broadcaster becomes the soundtrack of the pickaxe. One night Pelo and Sgualo, found unable to continue the excavation due to a downpour, decide to go to the station and come into contact with the world of student activism. Everything falls with the death of Francesco Lorusso, killed by a shot fired by a carabiniere on 11 March 1977 and with the violent clashes that ensue, clashes that totally involve the two protagonists, one arrested and the other fleeing on the roofs of Bologna to escape the police.

He enrolled in Chukyo Gakuin University in Gifu Prefecture, and from the spring of his 1st year, he played as shortstop as his school competed in the Tokai Region Baseball League. He won a triple-crown on his second year, and throughout his university career, he was awarded League Best Nine 5 times. His dynamic fielding earned him praise when he participated in the US-Japan University Baseball Championship Series. Professional career Kikuchi batting for the Carp in 2015 He was selected as the Hiroshima Toyo Carp's 2nd pick during the autumn 2011 professional baseball draft. He wished to be given Manager Kenjiro Nomura's previous jersey number 7, but was instead assigned the number 33. In 2012, he appeared in his first official game on June 29 as a pinch runner for Tetsuya Okubo. From July onwards, he filled in the role of 2nd baseman after Akihiro Higashide was sidelined by an injury in his right middle finger. He appeared in 63 games, and batted in 12 runs. In 2013, After Higashide injured his knee during spring training, Kikuchi eventually became fixed in the starting line-up. On May 12, he and Yoshihiro Maru hit two grand slams in the game against the Chunichi Dragons, the 22nd time it happened in NPB history. This was the first time in both the player's professional careers to hit a grand slam. Maru hit one on the 4th inning, and Kikuchi followed on the 6th. A plaque commemorating the team's two-grand-slam game was installed beyond the left field wall at Mazda Stadium two days later. On September 26, he recorded his 497th assist as second baseman, breaking the previous NPB record held by Chunichi's Masahiro Araki in 2005. He finished the season with 528 assists, setting an all-time NPB high. Three days later on the match with the Giants, he batted in his 50th sac bunt, beating the franchise record held by Higashide in 2001, and also topped the league.

In 2018, he was selected to the 2018 NPB All-Star game, making it his fifth consecutive appearance at the NPB All-Star series. After the 2019 season, Carp announced it was allowing Kikuchi to enter the posting system to play in Major League Baseball (MLB). However, Kikuchi signed a 4-year contract extension worth ¬•300 million ($2.7 million) a year with the Carp on December 27, 2019 after failing to secure a deal with any of the MLB teams.

The was assumed by the province in September 1937. Aside from paving and the construction of an interchange with Highway 401, it remained generally unchanged for the next six decades until it was decommissioned in 1997 and transferred to Elgin County and Middlesex County. The road has since been redesignated as Elgin County Road 74 and Middlsex County Road 74\\\\.  Route description  Highway 74 began at an intersection with Highway 3 in the community of New Sarum, midway between the city of St. Thomas to the west, and the town of Aylmer to the east. It crossed the St. Thomas and Eastern Railway just north of Highway 3 before curving to cross the West Catfish Creek, which it meandered alongside into Mapleton. Immediately north of that community, the route curved to the north and was straight for the remainder of its route. The highway continued, entering the village of Belmont, where it intersected a Canadian Pacific Railway line. North of there it crossed the boundary between Elgin County to the south and Middlesex County to the north. North of the county line, Highway 74 continued into the community of Derwent. Shortly thereafter, it crossed and interchanged with Highway 401 at Exit 195\\\\. The highway ended just north of Highway 401 in Nilestown at an intersection with Middlesex County Road 29 (Hamilton Road).  History  Highway 74 was established in mid-1937 when the New Sarum to Dorchester Road was designated by the Department of Highways (DHO), the predecessor to the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The section within Elgin County was assumed by the DHO on August 25, 1937, while the section within Middlesex County was assumed one week later on September 1. Originally an unpaved gravel road, the route was paved between Belmont and its northern terminus by 1938. The remainder of the route was paved in 1952. Otherwise, the route remained generally unchanged for six decades until March 31, 1997, when it was decommissioned in its entirety and transferred to Elgin County and Middlesex County. It has since been known as Elgin County Road 74 and Middlesex County Road 74.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Beppe Fenoglio. The film entered the competition at the 57th Venice International Film Festival, in which it won the Children and Cinema Award. Plot Johnny, a university student with a passion for English literature, deserts the Italian army in Rome after the September 1943 Badoglio Proclamation, and returns home to Alba. He initially takes refuge in a villa in the hills, where he devotes himself to his studies. After the death of a friend, he decides to take action. He leaves the city and joins the first partisan formation he meets, the \\"Reds\\", led by Biondo. He doesn't share their communist ideology, only their desire to fight the Fascists. Left alone after the group has dispersed under a German attack, he manages to reach a formation of the Badogliani, also called \\"Blues\\", or \\"Autonomous\\", led by the charismatic North Commander (Piero Balbo, nicknamed Nord). This group is in contact with the Anglo-American allies, who are better equipped and organized. Among them, he meets his dear friend Ettore, and together they participate in the temporary, symbolic occupation of Alba. Multiple small clashes decimate and disperse their forces, and Ettore is captured and sentenced to death. Johnny finds himself facing the hard winter of 1944 alone again. In the spring, Nord gathers the men and resumes guerrilla activities. The film ends on a still shot of Johnny engaged in combat, perhaps overwhelmed by enemies, followed by the words \\"Two months after the war was over\\".

This \\"Monumental Film\\" on Super 8 contains 35 episodes made by 22 filmmakers and collectives from East and West Germany. Each episode is a very loose interpretation of the stories, parables and stations of the life of Jesus. Plot Starting with the birth of the Jesus child, the film deviates wildly from the New Testament template, with the Virgin Mary now giving birth to twins, likely to give credence to the idea that Gnostic The Gospel of Thomas was actually written by the twin brother of Jesus. However, in keeping with tradition, only the life and suffering of the One is portrayed. Throughout the entire film, Jesus is shadowed by dark agents (the Four Evangelists) who seem to be the puppet masters of the story. But this preordained life spins out of control at the Last Supper, where Jesus develops a fondness for drinking blood. On his way to Calvary, he meets Saint Veronica and surrenders to this thirst, thereby acquiring immortality as a vampire. Jesus lives. Production The film's storyline, as well as the creative process of each episode, is inspired by the surrealist technique of the \\"exquisite corpse\\": the episodes' makers didn't know what happened in the previous scenes, receiving only a description of the last connecting shot ‚Äì and sometimes also the use of previous cast members ‚Äì in order to maintain the story's continuity. The constant figure in all the episodes was Michael Brynntrup, the initiator and coordinator of the overall project, in the role of Jesus. The 127-minute film was shot in black and white on Russian Super 8 film stock. These Super 8 cassettes were smuggled out of East Germany, often under precarious conditions, and then distributed to the participating filmmakers. Due to financial constraints, much of the film processing was done by the filmmakers themselves. This also contributed to the film's look, recalling the expressionist classics of the silent movie era. The Super 8 film was digitized and restored in 2014 with the financial support of the \\"Film Heritage\\" program of the (FFA) and the collaboration of the Deutsche Kinemathek Foundation; since then, the complete version is now available in DCP (Digital Cinema Package) format. Reception The film premiered at the 1986 Berlinale, as part of the International Forum of New Cinema, before going on a \\"Mission Tour\\" through 40 locations across West Germany that same year. Then in 1987, the film went on a \\"North America Mission\\", visiting 10 cities across the USA and Canada with the support of local Goethe Institutes. The film won the top prize at the 1986 Salzgitter Film Festival and the prize for best production at the 1987 Caracas International Super 8 Festival. The film's 11-minute trailer (entitled Veronika ‚Äì Vera Ikon Trailer of Jesus ‚Äì The Film) received an honorable mention at the 1988 Friedberg International Festival of Religious Films and at the 1988 Tel Aviv International Student Film Festival. In 2014 Jesus ‚Äì the Film ‚Äì the Book was published.Jesus ‚Äì Der Film ‚Äì Das Buch The book is a bilingual (German/English) compilation of materials documenting the three years of the Jesus Film project, ranging from the initial ideas and research in 1984, through facsimiles of the Jesus Letters that were sent to participating filmmakers, a detailed project diary with notes on the dynamics of group work, additional production materials along with images of the shoot and of props that attained the status of relics, to facsimiles of program flyers from the months-long \\"Mission Tours\\" through West Germany (1986) and North America (1987).

Franklin Bates Polson was a Canadian machinist and engineer, and co-founder with his father of the prominent Canadian shipbuilding firm the Polson Iron Works. Like his father William Polson, Franklin Bates Polson became a machinist and engineer, working for several Canadian railroads, until he and his father founded their shipbuilding firm in 1883. William Polson was the first President, and Franklin Bates Polson was the Secretary-Treasurer. Their firm built more than one hundred vessels, and built steam engines including for river boats constructed from local wood for service on rivers in Canada's then undeveloped west. Their firm built the Manitoba, said to be the first steel-hulled ship built in Canada, and the largest ship to sail on fresh-water. Their firm introduced the technique of designing vessels that could be disassembled. Vessels that were to serve on rivers in Western Canada were first assembled in the Polson shipyard, and then disassembled into sections that were small enough to fit on railway flatcars, for shipment to a landing on the river they were to service, for a second assembly and launch. In 1890 he became a director of the Parry Sound Lumber Company and the Parry Sound Navigation Company. The President of the Lumber Company, John Bellamy Miller, became an investor in the Iron Works. Miller in turn became a director of the Iron Works in 1892. Miller would eventually become the senior partner and President of the Polson Iron Works. The Polson Iron Works first shipyard was in Toronto, south of The Esplanade, between Sherbourne and Frederick. In 1888 the firm opened a second shipyard, on Lake Huron, at Owen Sound, a small yet growing city, with a railway connection. Owen Sound offered the firm an exemption from property tax. By 1895 Owen Sound City Council were reluctant to renew the property tax exemption, market conditions in the shipbuilding industry had changed, and the firm closed its Owen Sound location. Polson felt that the Federal government was unfairly subsidizing railroad industry, and that comparable subsidies should be offered to the shipping and shipbuilding industries. His efforts to lobby Ottawa were generally unsuccessful, with the exception of his efforts to court Joseph-Isra√´l Tarte, the Canadian Minister of Public Works. Tarte commissioned the first of a series of dredges to enhance navigation of the St Lawrence River. During Polson's lifetime the firm built the CGS Vigilant, said to be the first Canada's first Canadian built armed vessel. Although Polson had a bout of typhoid fever, his sudden death at a relatively young age was unexpected.

He is a former member of the now defunct Intersex Society of North America. The historian Alice Dreger credits him with starting the work of the intersex movement.  Early life  Tiger Devore was born with severe hypospadias and has experienced over 20 surgeries and four full reconstructions. He says that, \\"all the surgeries I suffered up to age 19 were unnecessary failures.\\" Devore has a PhD in clinical psychology and works as a sex therapist, activist and educator with over 30 years of experience in advocacy for intersex people and others who are sexually different from the mainstream. Devore has worked in research clinics at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical School, and the Human Sexuality Program at UCLA. During his time at Johns Hopkins University, he worked with the sexologist John Money. He has also worked for NIH as a crisis counsellor and worked with imprisoned sex offenders.  Activism  Alice Dreger describes how Devore, through his work at Johns Hopkins University and as an \\"out gay man in the 1970s-1980s in America\\" developed an awareness about \\"the clinical abuse of sexual minorities\\". He began to work as an educator and appeared on the Oprah show in 1984, considered to be the first television appearance by an intersex person talking about lived experiences. Dreger describes how Cheryl Chase was referred to him in November 1992, how Devore \\"taught her about the value of mutual support groups\\", and how, in 1993, Chase announced the establishment of the Intersex Society of North America (ISNA). Dreger states that: Dreger states that, despite the expertize offered by Devore and Chase at that time, \\"reporters and producers generally counted Devore and Laurent only as intersex subjects, while I counted as a supposedly objective expert\\". She states that these reforms still remain to be implemented in 2018. Devore continues to argues in favor of fully informed consent by intersex people to genital surgeries. He states: Devore has also argued against the use of disorders of sex development, as a term that is \\"more scientific,\\" and \\"more medical,\\" but also more treatable, and more of a stigma. In a statement in November 2015, Devore called for an end to unnecessary surgeries and \\"recognition of the rights of the child to bodily integrity and self determination\\", stating \\"that medicine and the research community continue to co-opt patient advocates in order to silence them by giving us the impression that we had access to influencing medical practice and research.\\" He is a board member, and former president, of the Hypospadias and Epispadias Association, and a former member of the now defunct Intersex Society of North America..

Arundells is a Grade II* listed house at 59 Cathedral Close, Salisbury, Wiltshire, England. Located on the West Walk of the Close, next to the 'Wardrobe' (Rifles Museum), it was the home of Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, from 1985 until his death in 2005. The house and its extensive garden are open to the public five days a week from late March to late October each year (it is closed on Thursdays and Fridays). History of the house Arundells has its origins as a Medieval canonry in the thirteenth century; its first recorded occupant was Henry of Blunston, Archdeacon of Dorset, who was resident from 1291 to 1316. Many other canons lived there up to Leonard Bilson, who was imprisoned in 1571 for practising sorcery and magic. The house was then leased by the Cathedral Chapter to a series of lay tenants, including Sir Richard Mompesson (from 1609) and John Wyndham (1718); the former rebuilt a large part of the property in the classic style of the day. Wyndham gave the house to his daughter, who married the third son, James Everard Arundel, of the sixth Lord Arundel of Wardour in 1752, resulting in the house acquiring its current name. Arundells housed Godolphin Girls' School and a boys' boarding school at different times in the 19th century, with Godolphin's, which is still located in Salisbury, moving from Arundells after an outbreak of cholera in the city. During the Second World War, Arundells was used as a book and wool store by the Red Cross. It fell into serious disrepair after the war and the Cathedral Chapter, responsible for the Close, considered demolishing it, before the leasehold was purchased for a token amount by Mr and Mrs Robert Hawkings in 1964, and the property was subsequently renovated. In 1985, at the age of 69, the former British Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath, bought Arundells, partly because of its proximity to the Solent, where he sailed. He engaged the renowned interior designer, Derek Frost, whose brief was to modernise the house in a contemporary fashion while paying respect to the Queen Anne original. Frost designed display cabinets to house Sir Edward's many trophies and awards. He also designed a number of custom pieces of furniture for the house that remain there to this day. It was the first time in his life that Sir Edward had owned a property. (Heath had been Prime Minister from June 1970 to March 1974, and remained a Member of Parliament until 2001, as the Father of the House at Westminster). In 1993, he added the freehold to the lease, purchasing it from Salisbury Cathedral, when the latter was seeking to raise money for its restoration programme. (Heath was an active supporter of the cathedral's 'Spire Appeal'.) Following Heath's death in July 2005, his estate was bequeathed to the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, established under his will, with the express purpose of ensuring that the house and its contents could be opened to the public as a place of historic interest. Opening to the public The ground-floor rooms at Arundells were opened to the public in 2008 and received about 50,000 visitors in the first six years to 2013 (a figure that has since gone up to around 80,000). In spring 2014, the trustees opened some of the first-floor rooms for the first time, including Heath's study, where he worked at a desk which originally belonged to an earlier Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. The exhibits on the first floor now include political and other memorabilia, such as Heath's ministerial boxes and personal banner from the Order of the Garter. The staircase is decorated by hand-painted Chinese wallpaper depicting classic legends. Heath's former political secretary, Douglas Hurd, was guest of honour at the formal opening of the study in summer 2014. The former Labour cabinet minister, Tony Benn, was ‚Äì despite his left-wing political views ‚Äì a close friend of Heath and an early supporter of efforts to ensure the permanent opening of the house, saying \\"I know the house, I knew Ted ... and visited him there after he retired from politics.‚Äù Subsequently, a number of political figures of all parties ‚Äì including Geoffrey Howe, David Hunt, Kenneth Clarke, Peter Mandelson, Hilary Benn, Charles Kennedy and Alan Beith, as well as Douglas Hurd ‚Äì expressed strong public support for the house being permanently open to the public, including the necessary planning permissions for this purpose. The former Labour Chancellor and Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, who was a lifelong friend of Heath, dating from their time together as students at Balliol College, Oxford, is said to have looked out towards Salisbury Cathedral from the front guest bedroom on the first floor of Arundells and remarked that the view was one of the ten finest in the country, to which Heath replied: \\"Why, what are the other nine?\\" Arundells is open to the public five days a week from late March to early November each year, being closed on Thursdays and Fridays. In addition to its public opening days, the property regularly hosts private events, including recitals and seminars. Arundells' art and other collections The house contains a varied and unique collection of artefacts reflecting Heath's time in public life, his passion for art, and his notable achievements in music and sailing. There is a large range of paintings, drawings, prints, European and Oriental ceramics, sailing memorabilia and political mementos, including: * An impressive art collection, including paintings by Churchill, Lowry, Sickert and John, and a selection of Japanese woodblock prints (see below); * An 8th-century Tang dynasty horse, a 16th-century Ming bowl, and a pair of vases from the Qianlong dynasty, given to Heath by Chairman Mao Zedong; * Heath's Steinway piano and other musical possessions and mementos; * Heath's yachting memorabilia, including nautical paintings, photographs and models of the five Morning Cloud yachts that Heath raced during his lifetime; * Original political cartoons by Giles, Jak, Low, Garland, Vicky, Trog and Cummings, depicting for example Heath's various political rivalries, including with Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher, as well as Britain's entry into the European Community in 1973, Conservative divisions over Europe, and his 1990 visit to Iraq, where he negotiated the release of Britons taken hostage as a 'human shield'. Among the paintings and prints by over 20 artists on display are Yachts at Sea by L. S. Lowry; Between Aix and Arles and Mimizan by Sir Winston Churchill, both given to Heath by the artist in the 1950s, one of which is unique in being signed 'WSC' twice; a series of scenes by John Piper, including two views of Arundells itself; three paintings by John Singer Sargent; one each by Augustus John, Walter Sickert and Ken Howard, and an impressive collection of Japanese woodblock prints by Utamaro and Hiroshi Yoshida, including the latter's well-known 'Inland Sea series', six seascapes of the same scene at different times in the day. A painting of Heath's home-town of Broadstairs in Kent by Robert Ponsonby- Staples was given to him by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman Charitable trust Arundells is owned and managed by the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, a charity established under Heath's will, whose honorary chairman is currently John MacGregor, who served as Heath's political secretary in the 1960s and as Cabinet minister under both Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Major in turn serves as president of the Foundation's fund-raising campaign. Previous chairmen include Robert Armstrong, the former Cabinet Secretary, and David Hunt, also a Cabinet minister under Major. When Heath died in 2005, his estate was valued at ¬£5 million and the Foundation opened Arundells to the public in 2008, initially for a three-year period, under planning permission at the time. Although the property has since received around 80,000 visitors, the trustees initially found it difficult to make the property self-financing, as they wished, and concluded in September 2010 that they would prefer to sell the house and its contents, at the end of the three-year period, and to allocate the proceeds to other charitable causes, notably music, rather than continue with existing arrangements. However, active grass-roots opposition from local supporters of the house, organized by the 'Friends of Arundells', led by Tony Burnside, prompted the Charity Commission to rule in September 2011 that any sale would be premature, with the Foundation asked to make more vigorous efforts to meet the central objective of Heath's will. The then trustees continued to argue for a sale, and although they opened the property for the 2012 season, they announced their continued wish to sell it thereafter, if the Charity Commission would permit them to do so. The developing impasse was broken in December 2012, when a group of former political advisers to Heath and to other leading Conservative figures (from the Heath, Thatcher and Major governments), led by Heath's former political secretary in the 1980s, Peter Batey, intervened in the dispute to offer a compromise, whereby funding would be provided to cover any operating deficit in the near-term, whilst improvements in the management of the property were undertaken, planning permission was secured from Wiltshire Council to allow the house and garden to be open on a permanent basis (rather than on a three- year rolling basis), and a longer-term fund-raising process was undertaken to guarantee the fabric of the property and allow Arundells to become a centre for charitable activity related to Heath's interests. (The issue of planning permission was important because the Cathedral Chapter objected to it, claiming that the continued opening of the house \\"might change the character of the area\\" by \\"reinforcing the element of commerciality\\", but their objections were overruled by Wiltshire Council). The Batey proposal was accepted by the Foundation in November 2013, with a view to Arundells remaining permanently open to the public, and Mr Batey was appointed as a trustee. With permanent planning permission granted soon thereafter, some of the first-floor rooms of the house, including Heath's study, were opened to the public in 2014. The Foundation began to undertake a series of lectures, seminars and exhibitions at the house and elsewhere in Salisbury, including talks by leading political and yachting personalities. Exhibitions have so far included images of 1965 as a year in British politics and culture; leading statesmen and women of the 1970s; Heath and Europe; Heath and Music; and Heath: The Soldier. The official Arundells website, maintained by the Foundation, includes a selection of video and audio links relating to Heath's life and career, including the 2011 BBC television documentary, 'Wilson versus Heath: The Ten-Year Duel', which traces the defining political rivalry between the leaders of the two main British political parties which ran between July 1965 and February 1975.

It was constructed in 1940 and is dedicated to Emperor Tenji. It was formerly an imperial shrine of the first rank (ÂÆòÂπ£Â§ßÁ§æ, kanpei taisha) in the Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines. The shrine is located near ≈åmijing≈´mae Station. History The shrine is dedicated to Emperor Tenji (626-671), the 38th emperor of Japan. Emperor Tenji carried out the Taika Reforms and aimed to complete the reform in the capital city, which was located on the west bank of Lake Biwa. He moved the Japanese capital from Asuka to ≈åtsu in 667. Emperor Tenji also presided over the establishment of the first r≈çkoku, or Japanese water clock system, which was installed in 671. The proposal for this shrine to Emperor Tenji was first considered by Japanese Diet in 1908. The construction of the shrine started in 1937 and was finished by November 7, 1940. Layout and design The shrine is surrounded by a large forest. Its main gate and buildings are painted red. The complex is located near the Otsu Palace.

He continued with this project for around three decades, during which he produced over 80 plays, which accounted for 17,000 shows. Eight of his plays crossed the 1000-shows mark. He is the record holder for producing highest number of plays in a career. He was a savvy businessman, unfazed by criticism. His company went on to stage several box-office hits.Marathi theatre loses its ace marketer Career Bhat formed an organisation named \\"Suyog\\" along with Gopal Algeri on 1 January 1985. He made all time record producing highest number of plays produced under one banner in Marathi play. He came into highlight against the play \\"Moruchi Mavashi\\". This was major hit at that time. Vijay Chavan, Vijay Patwardhan and Prashant Damle are some of the new actors produced with this play. He took the Marathi play outside India. His plays made shows in UK, United States and Europe and got enormous popularity over there. He handled the Marathi play very professionally and changed the definition of production that time. High production values, right marketing were the key of his success. Marathi play industry saw a down tern in the year 1997. His plays in America were a major boost during that time. He was the person who was thinking about Marathi plays for 24 hours a day Sudhir Bhat =Criticism= He was also criticized by many for making too many business transactions in the Marathi play allocation dates. He made loses in many plays but he did not left or change the business of producing the plays.Sudhir Bhat As the head of the Natya Nirmata Sangh (producers' association), he was the cynosure of many controversies. Many producers labelled him a 'contractor-producer', criticising his repertoire of commercially successful actors, particularly the faces that he usually banked on. Those include Prashant Damle, Vikram Gokhale, Kavita Lad, Dilip Prabhavalkar. He was absolutely unapologetic about his brand of theatre. He was very clear on his views regarding this. \\"To get people out of their houses to pay and watch a play is serious business and I do it very seriously,\\" he had said in an interview. He even drew flak for alleged unfair allotment of performance slots in Mumbai's select auditoriums. Many contemporaries called him dictatorial and alleged he had infused a commercial spirit in theatre. They accused him of using his clout to gain prime slots. However, Bhat maintained he stood for quality theatre, good marketing and high production values. He said his theatre was a box-set proscenium parameter, with no pretence of an experimental intent. =Successful person= Despite the barrage of criticism, everybody agrees that his commercial success did bring a sparkle to Mumbai's theatre arts in the 90s, when none of the plays were doing well. As a sagacious businessman, Bhat had a knack of disregarding the losses that some of his plays incurred. He was soon going to open the shows of his new play 'Beimaan'. In spite of his economic orientation, Bhat deserves credit for some off-track plays that expanded the Marathi theatre cosmos. In 2003, he cast 75-year-old Shriram Lagoo in 'Mitra'. The play was about a resilient, ageing, upper caste widower, who befriends his female Dalit nurse, much to the indignation of his family. The play was stage 218 times, mostly to packed auditoriums. 'Mitra' received a rapturous response in places like Dubai. 'Gandhi Virudh Gandhi' was another bold attempt to portray the contentious relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Harilal Gandhi. In other words, it made for risky business. But Bhat knew how to sell his plays. For instance, his production of PL Deshpande's life sketches 'Vyakti ani Valli' introduced the new generation to a masterpiece of humour. That the play banked on PL's glamour is a known fact. Death Ruling the roost of professional Marathi theatre are a select number of production companies, and Suyog has been among the foremost. On Thursday, 14 November 2013, its famous founder Sudhir Bhat died. He died of a heart attack at Hinduja hospital. ‡§®‡§æ‡§ü‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ß‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§≠‡§ü ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§ß‡§®  Plays produced in Marathi ‡§®‡§æ‡§ü‡§Ø ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ß‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§≠‡§ü ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§ß‡§® ‚Äò‡§∏‡•Å‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‚Äô‡§ö‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§π‡§∞‡§™‡§≤‡§æ, ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ß‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§≠‡§ü ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§è‡§ï‡•ç‡§ù‡§ø‡§ü # Appa and Bappa ‡§Ö‡§™‡•ç‡§™‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§£‡§ø ‡§¨‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§™‡§æ, # Uduni ja pakhara ‡§â‡§°‡•Å‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§™‡§æ‡§ñ‡§∞‡§æ, # Ekda pahava karun ‡§è‡§ï‡§¶‡§æ ‡§™‡§π‡§æ‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞‡•Ç‡§®, # Eka lagnachi gosht ‡§è‡§ï‡§æ ‡§≤‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•ã‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü - 1350 plays # Karayalo gelo ek ‡§ï‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ó‡•á‡§≤‡•ã ‡§è‡§ï, # Kalam 302 ‡§ï‡§≤‡§Æ ‡•©‡•¶‡•®, # Kashi mi rahu ashi ‡§ï‡§∂‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•Ç ‡§Ö‡§∂‡•Ä, # Kashat kay laphdyat pay ‡§ï‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§≤‡§´‡§°‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§ ‡§™‡§æ‡§Ø, # Kirvant ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∞‡§µ‡§Ç‡§§, # Gandhi viruddha Gandhi ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ß‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∞‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ß‡•Ä, # Char diwas premache ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§∏ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ö‡•á - 1012 plays # Javai maza bhala ‡§ú‡§æ‡§µ‡§à ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ù‡§æ ‡§≠‡§≤‡§æ, # Zala ekdacha ‡§ù‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ç ‡§è‡§ï‡§¶‡§æ‡§ö‡§Ç, # Tarun Turk mhatare ark ‡§§‡§∞‡•Å‡§£ ‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§π‡§æ‡§§‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï, # Ti phulrani ‡§§‡•Ä ‡§´‡•Å‡§≤‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä, # Dinuchya sasubai radhabai ‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡•Ç‡§ö‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§¨‡§æ‡§à ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§¨‡§æ‡§à, # Nishpap ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§™‡§æ‡§™, # Pritisangam ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§ø‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡§Æ, # Prema tuza rang kasa ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§§‡•Å‡§ù‡§æ ‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡§∏‡§æ, # Be lalna raja (Gujrathi) ‡§¨‡•á ‡§≤‡§æ‡§≤‡§®‡§æ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ (‡§ó‡•Å‡§ú‡§∞‡§æ‡§•‡•Ä), # Brahmchari ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä, # Bhrmacha bhopla ‡§≠‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ö‡§æ ‡§≠‡•ã‡§™‡§≥‡§æ, # Moruchi mavashi ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§∞‡•Ç‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§µ‡§∂‡•Ä - 2042 plays # Lagnachi bedi ‡§≤‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•á‡§°‡•Ä, # Wa guru ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ç!, # Vyakti ani valli ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§£‡§ø ‡§µ‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡•Ä, # Shri tashi sou ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§§‡§∂‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•å, # Shrimant ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§§, # Sandhyachhaya ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§õ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ, # Sundar mi honar ‡§∏‡•Å‡§Ç‡§¶‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã‡§£‡§æ‡§∞, # Havaas maj tu ‡§π‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡§ú ‡§§‡•Ç, # Hasat khelat ‡§π‡§∏‡§§ ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≥‡§§, # Hich tar premachi gammat aahe ‡§π‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§§‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§ó‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§§ ‡§Ü‡§π‡•á # Beiman ‡§¨‡•á‡§à‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® References Category:1951 births Category:Indian theatre managers and producers Category:Artists from Mumbai Category:Marathi people Category:2013 deaths ","title":"Sudhir Bhat"},{"id":"41536879","text":"Portrait of Dionys below right, under an engraved portrait of his father Elias.

He is best known for his documentation of the genocide which occurred under the Khmer Rouge (KR), and for being one of the first people to expose the human rights abuses being carried out at the time. Biography Ponchaud was born in Sallanches, France, and was one of twelve children. He attended seminary in 1958 but the following year he left due to national service. He spent three years in Algeria as a paratrooper during the Algerian War and returned to his studies in 1961, becoming a Jesuit. He applied through the Paris Foreign Missions Society for an assignment to undertake missionary work, and was assigned to Cambodia. Ponchaud was 26 years old and newly ordained when he arrived in Cambodia in 1965. He lived in Cambodia from 1965 to 1975. When Phnom Penh fell to the KR on 17 April 1975, Ponchaud was detained in the French embassy. On 8 May 1975, the KR evacuated the embassy, and Ponchaud was one of the last westerners to leave Cambodia. He is fluent in Khmer. Following the Communist Party of Kampuchea victory, all contact with the outside world was shut down, but following an editorial in Le Monde in February 1976, Ponchaud wrote a three-page article, which described the systematic abuses he had witnessed while Phnom Penh was being emptied, and following this he wrote Cambodge ann√©e z√©ro (Cambodia: Year Zero), a book on the Cambodian genocide, which was published in 1977, and his book is credited with being one of the first publications which dealt with the genocide. William Shawcross has said that the book is, \\"the best account of Khmer Rouge rule\\". For four years after his expulsion, he and Fran√ßois Bizot helped Cambodian and French citizens escape from Cambodia. Following the overthrow of the KR in 1979, he returned to Cambodia. He gave evidence at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia in 2013 during the war crime trials were being held. While on the stand, he said that he had been a witness to the \\"illegal\\" bombing, known as Operation Menu, of Cambodia by the American air force, and that Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State should stand trial for his actions. Ponchaud has said of the genocide that it, \\"Was above all, the translation into action the particular vision of a man [sic]: A person who has been spoiled by a corrupt regime cannot be reformed, he must be physically eliminated from the brotherhood of the pure.\\" In testimony given on what had happened to officers from the former Lon Nol regime, Ponchaud stated that in 1975 the KR had as an aim the destruction of anyone who had cooperated with both the US and the previous regime, and that he had heard from four witnesses that the KR had killed 380 people in Phnom Thipdey, a commune in Battambang Province. In 2001 a documentary titled The Cross and the Bodhi Tree: Two Christian Encounters with Buddhism was released, the film is about how Buddhism has shaped both the life of Ponchaud, and that of a Protestant nun, Mother Rosemary.

Founded by Hans J√∏rgen Tvede in 1852, it became the largest Nordic producer of small beer in the 1880s prior to its merger with several other breweries under the name De Forenede Bryggerier (United Breweries) in 1891. Its buildings were converted into apartments in the 1990s. The two buildings that front the street (No. 140 and 152) are heritage listed. History Tvede's Brewery in c. 1888, illustration from Danmarks industrielle Etablissementer Tvede's Brewery viewed from Vesterbrogade in about 1920Kastellet The courtyard at Tvede's Brewert in the 1910s Hans J√∏rgen Tvede was a builder of profession but his grandfather had owned a distillery on Gr√•br√∏dretorv and his father managed a brewery in Gr√∏nnegade. Tvede had also experience with brewing of beer from √òrholm M√∏lle, which he had rented for some ten years before acquiring a lot on Vesterbrogade in Copenhagen in 1851 to set up a new brewery. The first beer was produced the following year. The enterprise was an immediate success and he soon acquired more land on both sides of his brewery. After Tvede's death in 1878, his two sons, J√∏rgen Christian Tvede and Peter Valdemar Tvede, and his son-in-law, J√∏rgen Henrik Bruhn, took over the management of the business. In the 1880s, it became the largest producer of small beer in Scandinavia. The introduction of a tax on beer in 1881 put the Danish beer market under pressure. Instigated by Carl Frederik Tietgen, Tvedes Bryggeri merged with several other breweries in Copenhagen to form De Forende Bryggerier (The United Breweries). Both J√∏rgen Christian Tvede and J√∏rgen Henrik Bruhn served on the board of the new company until 1905. The production site on Vesterbrogade remained in use until 1899 when production of small beer moved to nearby Rahb√¶ks All√©. Today Tvede's Brewery today Christen Vestbergs og J√∏rgen Tvedes Stiftelse The two buildings on Vesterbrogade were listed in 1980. Built in 1862, Tvede lived in No. 142. No. 140 has a rear wing which was built in 1884 to a design by Christian Laurits Thuren. The architect Kristian Isager was responsible for the conversion of the buildings into apartments in 1992-93. The buildings were at that point owned by Dyrl√¶gernes og Agronomernes Pensionskasser but converted into an andelsboligforening in 2005. The production buildings on the rear are not listed but have status of bevaringsv√¶rdige. About half of the brewery was originally located on the other side of Vester F√¶lledvej (in Frederiksberg Municipality). This part of the buildings has been demolished. Christen Vestbergs og J√∏rgen Tvedes Stiftelse In the cellar of his brewery, Hans J√∏rgen Tvede opened the Vesterbro Samaritan where people in need could get a meal. On 10 August 1878, Hans J√∏rgen Tvede and his wife Birgitte Frederikke Tvede n√©e Vestberg founded Christen Vestbergs og J√∏rgen Tvedes Stiftelse. A building with residences for men and women in need was completed at Vesterbrogade 144 in 1870. A plaque with a portrait relief above the door commemorates Tvede.

Career=Prize-taking= At the time of HMS Britons launch, the United Kingdom was at war with the United States and France such that vessels of either country were considered legitimate prizes of war. As a result, on 1 December 1812 Briton recaptured , which the American privateer Grand Turk had captured a few weeks earlier as Wolfe's Cove was sailing from Quebec to England.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4838. Then on 11 December 1812 Briton, together with the frigate HMS Andromache, took the American brig Leader from Boston bound for Bordeaux, France with a cargo of fish. Then on 10 December they took the French privateer San Souci from St Malo. San Souci of 14 guns, had a crew of 120 men. San Souci arrived at Plymouth on 20 December. Lloyd's List described her as being of 16 guns and having a crew of 70. It further reported that Andromache and Briton had chased Sans Souci for 12 hours before catching her. San Souci had been out six weeks and had captured two British vessels, Speculation, which had been sailing from Cork to Lisbon, and the South Seas whaler Frederick. Sans Souci had only captured Frederick after an hour-long engagement in which Frederick lost her mate killed, and had \\"Body\\" and three or four other crew severely wounded.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4730. Sans Souci had on board the crew from Frederick. On 17 December the two frigates captured the American brig Columbia, loaded with coffee and sugar en route from Philadelphia to Bordeaux, then the brig Stephen carrying cotton, potash and skins from New York to Bordeaux, shortly followed by the brig Exception on 20 December, underway from Philadelphia to Bordeaux loaded with cotton. In January 1813 Briton and Andromache linked up with and on the 6th the three ships captured the brig Brutus travelling from New York to Bordeaux carrying cotton, coffee and sugar. After her boarding by a prize crew Brutus was not seen again, and it was assumed that she had either been recaptured or had foundered at sea. On 3 April 1813 captured the Prussian vessel Enigheidt. Briton, , and shared by agreement. Belle Poule also captured the American schooner Napoleon. Belle Poule was in company with Briton and the hired armed cutter Fancy, with Dispatch and Royalist sharing by agreement. On 3 July Briton captured the 2-gun letter of marque American schooner Joel Barlow, off Bordeaux. She had been sailing from to Charleston to France at the time of her capture. After a chase lasting seven hours, on 9 September 1813 Briton captured the fast sailing four-gun French privateer La Melance and her 26 man crew off Bordeaux. On 13 December, Briton was in sight when the privateer Chance recaptured Watson, and so shared in the salvage money. =Convoy escort and other duties in the Pacific= HMS Briton off Rio de Janeiro, March 1814 On 31 December 1813 HMS Briton under the command of Thomas Staineshttps://archive.org/details/narrativeofbrito00shil/page/n15 sailed from Spithead off the south coast of England for the East Indies as part of an escort for a convoy of 49 merchant ships. Briton left the flotilla to assist the disabled East Indiaman Fort William and sailed to Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira where the merchant vessel underwent necessary repairs.Shillibeer, p. 2 Eight days later the two ships set sail for Rio de Janeiro via Cape Verde, arriving on 20 March 1814. After docking at Rio, together with , under the command of Captain Philip Pipon, Briton received orders to proceed to the Pacific around Cape Horn where and were hunting for the American frigate USS Essex, which had attacked British whalers in the area. When Briton and Tagus arrived in Valparaiso on 21 May, the Phoebe and Cherub had already captured Essex following the Battle of Valparaiso. The four British ships left port on 26 June 1814 arriving at Paita further up the coast of Peru on 2 July. They left the same night and continued northwards close to the shore then anchored near the mouth of the Tumbes River on the border with Ecuador. > \\"It was on this place a boat belonging to the Phoebe was upset, which > occasioned the death of Lieut. Jago, and the Purser, but whether they were > drowned or eaten by the Alligators is uncertain. Several of these frightful > creatures were seen next morning basking themselves in the sun, and both > these gentlemen being good swimmers, one may be led to conclude they reached > the shore only to die a more wretched death.\\"Shillibeer, p. 26 =Gal√°pagos Islands & Nuku Hiva= On finding nearby Isla de la Plata devoid of water, Briton and Tagus headed south to Salango Island where they anchored overnight before setting sail for the Gal√°pagos Islands, arriving at Floreana Island, then known as Charles Island, on 25 July. The following day the two ships visited San Crist√≥bal Island (then Chatham Island), before proceeding to Santiago Island (then James Island). After a ten-day stay in the Gal√°pagos and a journey westward, on 28 August 1814, the flotilla anchored off Nuku Hiva (then called Sir Henry Martyn's Island), one of the Marquesas Islands, which Commodore David Porter of Essex had previously claimed for the United States and renamed Madison Island after the then US President. Porter had built Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva and a villa on the island, which the natives destroyed after his ship left. Before his departure, Sir Thomas Staines, with the consent of the local tribes excepting the \\"Typees\\" from the Tai Pi Valley, took possession of Nuku Hiva of behalf of the British Crown.Shillibeer, p.74 =Pitcairn Islands= HMS Briton at Pitcairn Island Nearly three weeks later, on the return journey to Valparaiso, Briton and Tagus made landfall at the then little known island of Pitcairn. {{quotetext=\\"On the 17th September, 1814, at about half-past two o'clock in the morning, to my surprise and astonishment, land was discovered, both by the Briton and Tagus, and nearly at the same moment. The ships were hove to, and, on hailing the Briton, it was determined to continue in that situation until daylight in the morning, to ascertain the exact position of the land in view, and, according to circumstances, to reconnoitre (sic) it, if necessary. We were then, by our reckoning, in the latitude of about 24¬∞ 40' S., and longitude 130¬∞ 24' W., the land bearing S.S.E. five or six leagues. As in all the charts in our possession there was no land laid down in or near this longitude, we were extremely puzzled to make out what island it could be, for Pitcairn Island being, according to all accounts, in the longitude of 133¬∞ 24' W., we could not possibly imagine so great an error could have crept into our charts with respect to its situation.\\"sign=Captain Philip Pipon, HMS Tagus. Descendants of the Bounty's Crew Unbeknownst to anyone aboard the two visiting ships, the only surviving mutineer from the Fletcher Christian led 1789 Mutiny on the Bounty, John Adams, remained alive on Pitcairn. Although Mayhew Folger aboard the American trading ship Topaz had paid a brief visit to the island in 1808 and the Admiralty in London were aware of the situation on the island from his subsequent report, neither Staines nor Pipon had been informed.Pitcairn's History. pitcairn.pn* The Royal Marine Commander aboard Briton, Lieutenant John Shillibeer, wrote in his account of their arrival: > \\"At this moment I believe neither Captain Bligh of the Bounty, nor > Christian, had entered any of our thoughts, and in waiting the approach of > the strangers, we prepared to ask them some questions in the language of > those people we had so recently left. They came ‚Äîand for me to picture the > wonder which was conspicuous in every countenance, at being hailed in > perfect English, what was the name of the ship, and who commanded her, would > be impossible‚Äîour surprize can alone be conceived.

However, they at length came on board, exemplifying not the > least fear, but their astonishment was unbounded.\\"Shillibeer p. 81‚Äì82 The first man from Pitcairn to board Briton soon proved who the islanders were. His name, he said, was Thursday October Christian, the first born on the island and son of Fletcher Christian. > \\"He was then about twenty-five years of age, a fine young man, about six > feet high, his hair deep black, his countenance open and interesting, of a > brownish cast, but free from all that mixture of a reddish tint which > prevails on the Pacific islands; his only dress was a piece of cloth round > his loins, and a straw hat, ornamented with the black feathers of the > domestic fowl ... we were glad to trace in his benevolent countenance all > the features of an honest English face. I must confess, I could not survey > his interesting person without feelings of tenderness and compassion.\\" From Christian and Adams, the visiting captains received an account of what had transpired since the mutiny, but as they had no instructions to take any action, they returned to Valparaiso, a journey that took about 25 days. =Return to the UK and later voyages= After three months cruising in the Pacific, on 12 February 1815, Briton and Tagus anchored off the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands to take on supplies. Briton remained in the Pacific until the end of April 1815 when she returned to Rio. At this time British merchants in Chile requested that a British warship continue to protect their interests and nominated Sir Thomas Staines as their preferred commander; instead he received orders to return home, arriving at Plymouth on 8 July 1815. Shortly afterwards Briton was put out of commission at Portsmouth as a result of cuts in the Royal Navy following Wellington's victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.

The general movements assessment involves measuring movements that occur spontaneously among those less than four months of age and appears to be most accurate test for the condition. These include the tonic neck reflex, grasp reflex, Moro reflex, tongue thrust reflex and rooting reflexes. The quality of the child's general movements gives information about how the brain connects, particularly the periventricular white matter. The GMA is best performed 3 months post-term (if the child was born prematurely, the assessment date is not at three months old, but is conducted at the same time as if they were born at term). At around that time, in typical infants, a pattern called 'fidgety movements' is evident, and if the movements are abnormal or the fidgety movements are not apparent, the child is at risk of developing CP. A pattern known as 'writhing movements' frequently gives false positives for cerebral palsy.

By this legend, Charlemagne took rest at the Karlstein and threatened to kill anyone who dared to wake him up. So his dog was thrown at him to wake him up as the Saxons closed in. As he noticed the danger, he yelled ‚Ä≥So sure as I will split this stone with my sword, so certain we will defeat the Saxons‚Ä≥ swung onto his horse, jumped over the Karlstein and cut it with his sword.

It has over 1,482 academic staff and 32,000 students, and it is Ireland's largest university, based on 2017/18 student enrolments. UCD originates in a body founded in 1854, which opened as the Catholic University of Ireland on the Feast of Saint Malachy and with John Henry Newman as its first rector; it re-formed in 1880 and chartered in its own right in 1908. The Universities Act, 1997 renamed the constituent university as the \\"National University of Ireland, Dublin\\", and a ministerial order of 1998 renamed the institution as \\"University College Dublin ‚Äì National University of Ireland, Dublin\\". Originally in locations across Dublin city, all faculties have since relocated to a campus at Belfield, four kilometres to the south of the city centre. The 2020 U.S. News & World Report rates UCD as the highest globally ranked Irish university, and the 2019 QS World University Rankings rate UCD as 1st in Ireland and 78th in the world for employability and reputation. A report published in May 2015 showed the economic output generated by UCD and its students in Ireland amounted to ‚Ç¨1.3 billion annually. UCD dropped out of the top 250 universities in the 2020 rankings, while Trinity College Dublin remained the highest ranked Irish university.https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/trinity-college-remains-top- university-in-ireland-1015725.html Five Nobel Laureates are among UCD's alumni and current and former staff. History UCD can trace its history to the institution founded in 1854 as the Catholic University of Ireland. It became University College Dublin in 1908 under the Universities Act. Saint John Henry Newman, first rector of the then Catholic University of Ireland, out of which sprang the current UCD =Catholic University of Ireland= Newman house, St Stephen's Green, Dublin. The original location of UCD. The Gardens located behind Earlsfort Terrace donated and renamed in his honour by UCD in 1908 After the Catholic Emancipation period of Irish history, Archbishop of Armagh attempted to provide for the first time in Ireland higher-level education for followers of the Catholic Church and taught by such people. The Catholic Hierarchy demanded a Catholic alternative to the University of Dublin's Trinity College, whose Anglican origins the Hierarchy refused to overlook. Since the 1780s, the University of Dublin had admitted Catholics to study; a religious test, however, hindered the efforts of Catholics in their desire to obtain membership of the University's governing bodies. Thus, in 1850 at the Synod of Thurles, it was decided to open a university in Dublin for Catholics. As a result of these efforts, a new \\"Catholic University of Ireland\\" opened in 1854 on St Stephen's Green, with John Henry Newman appointed as its first rector. The Catholic University opened its doors on the feast of St Malachy, 3 November 1854. In 1855, the Catholic University Medical School was opened on Cecilia Street. As a private university, Catholic University was never given a royal charter, and so was unable to award recognised degrees and suffered from chronic financial difficulties. Newman left the university in 1857. In 1861, Bartholomew Woodlock was appointed Rector and served until he became Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise in 1879. Henry Neville was appointed Rector to replace Woodlock. In 1880, the Royal University of Ireland was established and allowed students from any college to take examinations for a degree. =Foundation of University College Dublin= Government Buildings, Dublin. The former location of the UCD science and engineering faculties. Opened by King George V in 1905 In 1882, Catholic University reorganised and the St. Stephen's Green institution was renamed University College, and it began participating in the Royal University system. In 1883, Fr William Delany SJ was appointed the first president of University College. The college attracted academics from around Ireland, including Fr. Gerard Manley Hopkins and James Joyce. Some notable staff and students at the school during this period included Francis Sheehy- Skeffington, Patrick Pearse, Hugh Kennedy, Eoin MacNeill, Kevin O'Higgins, Tom Kettle, James Ryan, Douglas Hyde and John A. Costello. Gerard Manley Hopkins, one of the leading Victorian poets of the 19th Century, Professor of Greek and Latin In 1908, the National University of Ireland was founded and the following year the Royal University was dissolved. This new University was brought into existence with three constituent University Colleges ‚Äì Dublin, Galway and Cork. Following the establishment of the NUI, D. J. Coffey, Professor of Physiology, Catholic University Medical School, became the first president of UCD. The Medical School in Cecilia Street became the UCD Medical Faculty and the Faculty of Commerce was established. Under the Universities Act, 1997, University College Dublin was established as a constituent university within the National University of Ireland framework. In 1911, land donated by Lord Iveagh helped the university expand in Earlsfort Terrace/Hatch Street/ St Stephen's Green. Iveagh Gardens was part of this donation. =UCD and the Irish War of Independence= The Tierny (Administration) and Newman (Arts) Buildings, Belfield campus, UCD. UCD is a major holder of archives of national and international significance relating to the Irish War of Independence. In 1913, in response to the formation of the Ulster Volunteers, Eoin MacNeill, professor of early Irish history, called for the formation of an Irish nationalist force to counteract it. The Irish Volunteers were formed later that year and MacNeill was elected its Chief-of-staff. At the outbreak of World War I, in view of the Home Rule Act 1914 and the political perception that it might not be implemented, the leader of the Home Rule Party, John Redmond, urged the Irish Volunteers to support the British war effort as a way of supporting Irish Home Rule. This effort on behalf of Home Rule included many UCD staff and students. Many of those who opposed this move later participated in the Easter Rising. Several UCD staff and students participated in the rising, including Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Michael Hayes and James Ryan, and a smaller number, including Tom Kettle and Willie Redmond, fought for the British in World War I. Many UCD staff, students and alumni fought in the Irish War of Independence. Following the signing of the Anglo- Irish Treaty, four UCD graduates joined the government of the Irish Free State. UCD graduates have since participated in Irish political life ‚Äì three of the nine Presidents of Ireland and six of the fourteen Taoisigh have been either former staff or graduates. = Expansion = In 1926, the University Education (Agriculture and Dairy Science) Act transferred the Royal College of Science in Merrion Street and Albert Agricultural College in Glasnevin to UCD. In 1933, Belfield House was purchased for sporting purposes. =Move to Belfield= UCD graduates, 15 July 1944 'Noah's egg' outside the Veterinary School by Rachel Joynt (2004) In 1940, Arthur Conway was appointed president. By the early 1940s, the college had become the largest third-level institution in the state and the college attempted to expand the existing city-centre campus. It was later decided that the best solution would be to move the college to a larger greenfield site outside of the city centre and create a modern campus university. This move started in the early 1960s when the faculty of science moved to the new park campus at Belfield in a suburb on the south side of Dublin. The Belfield campus developed into a complex of modern buildings and inherited Georgian townhouses, accommodating the colleges of the University as well as its student residences and many leisure and sporting facilities. One of UCD's previous locations, the Royal College of Science on Merrion Street is now the location of the renovated Irish Government Building, where the Department of the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) is situated. University College Dublin also had a site in Glasnevin for much of the last century, the Albert Agricultural College, the southern part of which is now occupied by Dublin City University, the northern part is where Ballymun town is located. Architecture The new campus was largely designed by A&D; Wejchert & Partners Architects and includes several notable structures, including the UCD Water Tower which was built in 1972 by John Paul Construction. The Tower won the 1979 Irish Concrete Society Award. It stands 60 metres high with a dodecahedron tank atop a pentagonal pillar. The Tower is part of the UCD Environmental Research Station. = 1950-2000 = In 1964, Jeremiah Hogan was appointed president and Thomas E. Nevin led the science faculty to move to a new campus at Belfield. Also that year, UCD became the first University in Europe to launch an MBA programme. In 1967, Donogh O'Malley proposed a plan to merge UCD and Trinity. Between 1969 and 1970, the Faculties of Commerce, Arts and Law move to Belfield. In 1972, Thomas Murphy was appointed president. In 1973, the library opened. In 1980, the college purchased Richview and 17.4 acres and the architecture faculty moved there. In 1981, the Sports Complex opened. In 1986, Patrick Masterson was appointed president. During the 1990s, some of the students of Women's Studies petitioned to rename their Gender Studies building after Hanna Sheehy- Skeffington to honour her contribution to women's rights and equal access to third-level education. Her husband Francis Sheehy-Skeffington was himself an alumnus of the university and Hanna of the Royal University, a sister university of UCD. Their campaign was successful and the building was renamed the Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington Building. In 1990, the UCD purchases Carysfort College, Blackrock, and became the location of the Smurfit Graduate school of business. The first student village, Belgrove, opened that year as well. In 1992, the second student village, Merville, opened and the Centre for Film studies is established. In 1993, Art Cosgrove was appointed president. In 1994, O'Reilly Hall was opened. In Malaysia, UCD, together with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), owns a branch campus within George Town, the capital city of the State of Penang. Established in 1996, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and University College Dublin Malaysia Campus (RUMC) offers a twinning programme in Medicine where students spend the first half of their course in either RCSI or UCD, before completing their clinical years at RUMC. = 2000s = In 2003, NovaUCD, a Euro Innovation and Technology Transfer Centre opened. In 2004, Hugh Brady was appointed president. In 2006, UCD Horizons begins. In 2009, Trinity and UCD announce the Innovation Alliance. In 2010, NCAD and UCD form an academic alliance. In 2012 the expanded Student and Sports Centre opened. In 2012, the college closed the athletics track and field facilities and students demanded an apology. In 2013, the UCD O'Brien Centre for Science opened and the UCD Sutherland School of Law opened. It is now the largest Common Law law school in the European Union. In 2015, UCD opened a global centre in the US. In 2019, UCD became the first Irish university to launch a Black Studies module, coordinated by Dr Ebun Joseph and Prof Kathleen Lynch.

Student life=Students' Union= Glenomena student residences, Belfield campus, UCD The students' union in the college has been an active part of campaigns run by the National Union, USI, and has played a role in the life of the college since its foundation in 1974. The Union has also taken stances on issues of human rights that have hit the headlines in Ireland and around the world, in particular it implemented a ban of Coca-Cola products in Student Union controlled shops on the basis of alleged human and trade union rights abuses in Colombia.

They cater for many interests ranging from large-scale party societies such as Ag Soc, Arts Soc, Commerce and Economics Society, ISS (and its subgroup AfricaSoc), INDSoc(Indian Society) and MSoc(Malaysian Society) who have the largest student communities of Indian and Malaysian students in Ireland. There are also religiously-interested groups such as the Christian Union, the Islamic Society, the Atheist and Secular Society, a television station Campus Television Network, academic-oriented societies like the Economic Society, UCD Philosophy Society, Mathsoc, Classical Society, and An Cumann Gaelach, an Irish-language society and such charities as St. Vincent de Paul, UCDSVP. There are two main societies for international students, ESN UCD (part of the Erasmus Student Network) and the International Student's Society. Many UCD societies engage in voluntary work on-campus and across Dublin. For example, the UCD Student Legal Service is a student-run society that provides free legal information clinics to the students of UCD. Irish political parties are represented on campus including √ìgra Fianna F√°il, Young Fine Gael, and UCD Labour Youth. The college has two debating unions. The oldest societies are the Literary and Historical Society, which is currently in its 160th session, An Cumann Gaelach who are entering their 110th session, the Commerce & Economics Society who are entering their 105th session and the Law Society which was founded in 1911. The L&H; and Law Society are the major debating societies of the college and two of the leading ones in Ireland. Ireland's most prestigious competition, the Irish Times Debate the L&H; has 11 team wins and 12 individual ones with the Law Society achieving 2 team wins and 2 individual wins respectively. The two societies have also been successful further afield at the UK and Ireland John Smith Memorial Mace (formerly The Observer Mace) with the L&H; winning 5 titles and Lawsoc 2 titles. UCD has hosted the World University Debating Championships twice, most recently in 2006. At the start of the 12/13 Academic Year, the Literary and Historical Society achieved a membership of 5143 becoming the largest student society in UCD and in Europe. The UCD Dramsoc is the university drama society, it is noted for an active membership and a number of notable alumni. The university also has a successful sinfonia called University College Dublin Symphony Orchestra. Chris O'Dowd former member of UCD Dramsoc =Student publications and media=Newspapers UCD has two student newspapers currently published on campus, the broadsheet University Observer and the tabloid College Tribune =The University Observer= The University Observer won the Newspaper of the Year award at the National Student Media Awards in April 2006, an accolade it has achieved many times, most recently in April 2014. Founded in 1994, its first editors were Pat Leahy and comedian Dara √ì Briain. Many figures in Irish journalism have held the position of editor including The Irish Times duty editor Roddy O'Sullivan and political editor Pat Leahy, AFP business reporter Enda Curran, The Irish Examiner political editor Daniel McConnell, RT√â News reporter Samantha Libreri; Today FM political correspondent Gavan Reilly; and TV researcher Alan Torney. The efforts of its staff were noted by the prestigious Guardian Student Media Awards with a nomination for \\"Best Newspaper\\", the first Irish student publication to receive such recognition. In 2001, in addition to several Irish National Student Media Awards, the University Observer under McConnell and Curran took the runner up prize for \\"Best Publication\\" at the Guardian Student Media Awards in London. To date, The University Observer has won 29 Irish Student Media Awards. The main sections within the paper are campus, national and international news, comment, opinion and sport. In addition, each issue is accompanied by an arts and culture supplement called O-Two, with music interviews, travel, fashion and colour pieces. The University Observer is funded by the UCD Students' Union, but its content, in theory, remains editorially independent. =College Tribune= The College Tribune was founded in 1989, with the assistance of noted political commentator Vincent Browne. Then an evening student at UCD, Browne noted the lack of an independent media outlet for students and staff and set about rectifying this with the establishment of a student newspaper. The paper was initially established with links to the Sunday Tribune, though over time these links faded and ultimately, the Tribune would long outlast its national counterpart. The paper has since its inception supported itself financially through commercial advertising in its print edition. Operating under such a model theoretically allows the paper and its staff to maintain genuine editorial independence from both university authorities and the Students' Union. The Tribune has been recognised on a number of occasions at the national student media awards, particularly in sports writing, of which the paper maintains a strong tradition. In addition to winning Student Newspaper of the Year at the 1996 USI & Irish Independent Media Awards, then editor Conor Lally was also awarded Student Journalist of the Year. 2003 saw Tribune stalwart Peter Lahiff win Diversity Writer of the Year at the Guardian Student Media Awards, to-date the only Irish based recipient of a Guardian award. College Tribune sections include news, sport, features, arts, film and entertainment, music, fashion, business, and politics & innovation. These are contained in both the paper proper and its arts culture supplement The Trib. The paper is also noted among students for the launch of The Evil Gerald, a satirical 'paper within a paper'. Radio and television UCD also has a student radio station, Belfield FM, broadcasting throughout the academic year online on the station's website. The station is independently run by the UCD Broadcasting Society and has produced well known Irish radio presenters such as Ryan Tubridy and Rick O'Shea (of RT√â fame) and Barry Dunne of 98FM. Belfield FM is the successor to UCD FM, which was operated within the entertainment office of the students' union as a service for students. Initially launched in 1992, the station rebranded in 2000 and has operated since then under the current name. As a result of the implementation of the students' union's new constitution at the beginning of the 2012 / 2013 academic year, the station now operates as a student society.

Constable. p.63 The tower is conspicuous throughout the Howe. It may be viewed by appointment. History The first owners of Balfluig were a branch of Clan Forbes. Voussoirs on the doorway show the date 1556. The castle was burned during the battle of Alford in 1645. It was purchased by the Farquharson of Haughton in 1753. In due course it was used as a farmhouse. It was derelict by the 1960s, but a new owner, Mark Tennant, restored it, as one of the earliest fortalices saved through the help of the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland, particularly through the advocacy of W. Douglas Simpson. The date of building is significant as it is in a period where there was little private building in Scotland. Structure The plan of the castle is highly unusual. The main block of the castle has three storeys, and a garret. The wing, one storey higher, and topped by a watch-tower, projects eastward from the main block in a way that creates two re-entrant angles. A semicircular stair tower rises in the south-west angle. The outer angles are corbelled square beneath roof level, being rounded lower. The walls have many gun-loops. On the south gable is a massive chimney stack. A courtyard leads to the entrance, an arched doorway protected by gun-loops, which is in the main re-entrant angle. The basement of the main block contains two vaulted chambers, the kitchen and the wine-cellar. There is a private stair to the Hall above, which has a vaulted withdrawing room attached. In the basement of the wing is a vaulted guardroom, which has a small prison beneath the turnpike stair. The tower is roughly built of pinned boulder rubble; the dressings are part sandstone and part granite. The open timbered roof probably dates from the restoration of the castle after the battle of Alford. It is a category A listed building. Tradition Tradition asserts that there was another fortalice nearby. The rival lairds would shoot at each other from their watch-rooms. After one finally killed the other the surviving laird was filled with remorse.

He was a descendant of Melchior Wagner, hatmaker to the Royal Family, and married into a wealthy Sussex family who had a longstanding ecclesiastical connection with Brighton. Wagner paid for and oversaw the building of five churches in the rapidly growing seaside resort, and \\"dominated religious life in the town\\" with his forceful personality and sometimes controversial views and actions. His son Arthur Wagner (1824‚Äì1902) continued the family's close association with Brighton. Wagner tutored the Duke of Wellington's sons for several years, and the Duke was responsible for appointing Wagner to the position of Vicar of Brighton‚Äîa role fulfilled by his grandfather Henry Michell in the 18th century. \\"This appointment was to have very considerable implications for the Anglican Church in Brighton\\" for the next century, as Wagner (and, later, his son) built new churches, founded and endowed charitable causes, imposed their strong characters on the town and became embroiled in regular disputes and controversies. The \\"Purchas affair\\", involving one of Wagner's curates and a proprietary chapel, was \\"the most extraordinary event\\" in Brighton's Victorian-era religious history and was reported nationally. Early life Henry Michell Wagner was born on 16 November 1792 at 93 Pall Mall, London. His baptism took place on 15 December of that year at St James's Church, Piccadilly. He was the youngest of four children of Melchior Henry Wagner and Anne Elizabeth Michell. Melchior Henry Wagner (1749‚Äì1811) was the grandson of Melchior Wagner, born in 1685 in Coburg, who moved to London, was naturalised in 1709 and became hatmaker to King George I in 1717. Anne Elizabeth Michell (1757‚Äì1841) was the daughter of Rev. Henry Michell, who was Vicar of Brighton until his death in 1789. The Michells were a dynasty of wealthy yeomen from the West Sussex village of Shipley, and Rev. Henry Michell was a wealthy and influential figure in Brighton during the 18th century, when the town was growing in popularity and status. The Gentleman's Magazine commented that \\"the most distinguished personages that visited [Brighton] courted his acquaintance\\". Henry Michell Wagner went to Eton College in 1805, attained King's Scholar status in 1808 and left for King's College, Cambridge in 1812, where he read Classics. From 1815 until 1824 he was a fellow of the college. He attended his graduation ceremony in July 1819. Starting in 1814, he combined his studies with extensive travelling in Europe, particularly with the aim of learning languages. A visit to France, Belgium and the Netherlands in 1814 nearly ended in disaster when the boat he was on capsized. He suffered another bad experience during his first ever visit to his future home town, Brighton, in February 1816. An armed robber accosted him in a twitten near Pool Valley and shot at his head when he refused to give up his money. Wagner put his hand in front of his face, which saved his life: the bullet lodged in the bone, causing an injury which took months to heal. Nevertheless, in March 1816 he started his version of the Grand Tour with a boat trip to Dieppe, from where he travelled to places such as Fontainebleau, Geneva, Milan, Florence, Rome and Messina. Wagner was recalled from his tour in the autumn of 1817 to become tutor to the sons of the Duke of Wellington. The duke's brother the Marquis of Wellesley had asked the advice of his schoolfriend Joseph Goodall, Provost of Eton, and Goodall suggested Wagner. The Duke \\"seems to have accepted the recommendation without further enquiry\\", and Wagner returned to Brighton via Dieppe and travelled to Eton to meet Goodall. He was then sent back to France to meet the Duke, who was staying at Cambrai. His interview was successful, and after another visit to Paris Wagner returned to England to meet the Duke's sons‚Äîthe ten-year-old Marquess of Douro and Lord Charles Wellesley, who was a year younger. In 1820, he took on a third pupil. Gerald Wellesley, 11-year-old son of the Duke's brother Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley and his estranged wife Lady Charlotte Cadogan. He had been adopted by the Duchess of Wellington and lived with the rest of the family at Stratfield Saye House in Hampshire. Wagner lived there as well until the boys went to Eton College, at which time he took a house there. He was \\"for the most part satisfied\\" with the ability and behaviour of his pupils, and remained in contact with them until 1827 or later. Ordination A new vicarage was built for Wagner in 1835. Soon after meeting his future wife Elizabeth, Wagner was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England. He undertook preparation with his uncle Rev. John Henry Michell, rector of St Andrew's Church, Buckland, Hertfordshire, during September and October 1821. His ordination ceremony took place at Ely Cathedral on 28 October 1821 and was undertaken by the Bishop of Ely Bowyer Sparke, who knew his mother. The following Sunday, at St Andrew's Church, Clewer (near his Eton home), he conducted his first service. Soon afterwards, Dr Robert James Carr became Bishop of Chichester and the position of Vicar of Brighton became vacant. Normally, the living would be presented by the Bishop, but on this occasion the responsibility passed to The Crown. The Duke of Wellington had the authority to present the living to a priest of his choice, and on 12 May 1824 he offered it to Wagner. \\"His choice of this living ... showed that he was most anxious to be of service to his prot√©g√©\\": Wagner would have had an emotional connection to Brighton because his grandfather had served forty-five years as Vicar of Brighton. Wagner accepted the position, and immediately asked for the Bishop of Ely to ordain him as a priest so he could take up the position (as he was still only a deacon). The ceremony took place on 16 May 1824 at St James's Church, Piccadilly. He took up the living on 30 July of that year, and on 1 August 1824 he took his first services at St Nicholas' Church, Brighton's parish church. At the time, the vicarage was a medieval house in The Lanes which had been rebuilt for Wagner's grandfather Rev. Henry Michell in 1790. Henry Michell Wagner occupied it until 1835, when the firm of Cheesman & Son designed and built a new vicarage in the Montpelier district. Wagner was appointed Treasurer of the Chichester Cathedral in April 1834. The position had been created in the 12th century by Bishop Hilary and came with its own house on the cathedral close near the Bishop's Palace. Wagner had the house demolished and a replacement built on its site. Early years as Vicar of Brighton St Peter's Church. Wagner was now in ecclesiastical control of a town which was growing rapidly but which had only three public places of Anglican worship: St Nicholas' Church, the Chapel Royal (1795) near the Royal Pavilion, and St James's Chapel east of the town centre (1810‚Äì13). Nonconformist places of worship, meanwhile, were numerous: Brighton Friends Meeting House, Brighton Unitarian Church, Dorset Gardens Methodist Church, Union Chapel and chapels for Particular Baptists and the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion all existed by 1824, as did a Roman Catholic church and a synagogue. Several churches were being built or were planned to provide more capacity‚Äîbut Wagner soon became embroiled in conflicts with some of the people involved. St Margaret's Chapel was built in 1824 to serve the fashionable Regency Square. Founded solely as a property speculation, it was paid for by Barnard Gregory‚Äîa man who would have \\"upset a much less difficult character than Wagner\\". His activities included banking, acting and journalism, and he owned several newspapers including one so scandalous that he was regularly sued and jailed. Wagner was involved in lengthy and tiresome correspondence over Gregory's choice of perpetual curate for the church, Edward Everard (one of the curates of St Nicholas' Church). Wagner refused to permit his appointment‚Äîhe had a right of veto‚Äîand eventually the Bishop of Chichester had to get involved. Wagner did eventually allow Everard to be appointed, but he bought the right to the patronage from Gregory for ¬£500 so that the appointment of curates to the church was formally under his (Wagner's) control. Within three years, three more Anglican churches‚Äîall proprietary chapels‚Äîhad been opened in Brighton. St George's Church near the Kemp Town estate was sponsored by the estate's developer Thomas Read Kemp and opened on 1 January 1826. Rev. J.S.M. Anderson, a friend of Wagner's, became its Perpetual curate in 1829. Holy Trinity Church in The Lanes was built in 1817 for Kemp when he briefly seceded from the Church of England to form his own sect; he returned to Anglicanism in 1823 and the church was reconsecrated for Anglican worship after an Act of Parliament in 1826, which also dealt with the status within the parish of St James's Chapel. Next came St Mary's Church on the road between St James's and St George's. Barnard Gregory had the authority to build a proprietary chapel there, but in 1826 he sold the site to furniture firm proprietor Charles Elliott. He asked Wagner's permission to build a church there for his son, Rev. Henry Venn Elliott, who was about to be ordained. Amon Henry Wilds designed the church in the Classical style, and it opened for worship in 1827. From 1824, Wagner oversaw the design and building of St Peter's Church, a landmark chapel of ease \\"at the entrance to the town\\". Its construction had been sanctioned in 1818, and the Commissioners for Building New Churches had lent ¬£15,000 interest-free. In Wagner's first year as Vicar of Brighton, the competition to select an architect was held, Charles Barry was selected, and the church was founded in 1824 and opened in 1828. \\"The building of St Peter's proved to be a stormy passage for all concerned\\". Amon Henry Wilds and Charles Busby had been favourites to design the church but were runners-up in the competition. Also, the work ended up costing more than ¬£20,000 instead of Barry's estimated ¬£14,700. Wagner had difficult work to do in balancing the demands for more money with efforts to keep the debt down. There were disputes with the Vestry; and pew rental‚Äîa practice Wagner was opposed to, and which caused him much trouble throughout his time in Brighton‚Äîthen became an issue. The Vestry demanded a lower proportion of free pews to bring in more income and reduce the building debt more quickly; Wagner, who authorised 1,100 free pews in the 1,800-capacity church, opposed this. The Commissioners for Building New Churches eventually agreed to change the balance to 900 free and 900 rented pews. Problems also arose over the internal fittings, the illuminated clock tower and Charles Barry's insistence on retaining the architectural plan. Wagner was connected with a curious incident in 1837 which \\"so upset the Duchess of St Albans that she vowed she would never set foot in Brighton again\\". An unknown blackmailer sent an anonymous letter to her husband William Beauclerk, 9th Duke of St Albans, fraudulently using the name of a prominent firm of Brighton solicitors and claiming to have been written on behalf of Wagner and Thomas Read Kemp. Kemp, a friend of the Duke and Duchess, knew nothing of the letter, and Wagner and the solicitors confirmed it was a forgery. The mystery was never solved, but it was apparently connected with an incident where the Duke went hunting with hawks at Devil's Dyke and forced a farmer to move his sheep elsewhere. Wagner's churches St Paul's Church in central Brighton for his son Arthur. The Anglican cause grew strongly under Henry Michell Wagner's guidance as Vicar of Brighton. By 1866, there were 27 churches in the town, compared to 14 in 1841, and Wagner himself had founded six of them. Of the six only St Paul's Church, which he built for his son Arthur, remains in Anglican use though; one other is now used by the Greek Orthodox community and the others have been demolished. Although several churches had been built in the 1820s and 1830s, large areas of the town still had inadequate provision for worship: northern and eastern areas, which were the poorest areas, were particularly badly served. Wagner's \\"major campaign of church-building\\" aimed to address this deficiency. Wagner's first church served Brighton's largest area of poor housing‚Äîthe district around Eastern Road now known as Kemptown. All Souls Church was founded on 29 July 1833‚ÄîWagner himself laid the first stone‚Äîand opened on 4 April 1834. Its cost of ¬£3,082.10s.8d. was met mostly by the clergy of other local churches (¬£1,000) and the Society for the Building and Enlargement of Churches (¬£500). Wagner contributed ¬£150, and many of his relatives assisted as well. \\"Money did not run to architectural embellishments\\" on the starkly plain building; there was a rudimentary Classical fa√ßade facing north, and all other elevations were hidden. The interior had Gothic Revival features and was old-fashioned for the date, resembling an 18th-century \\"preaching house\\". The church became redundant in 1968 and was demolished that year during work to widen Eastern Road. Soon afterwards, Wagner founded Christ Church in the south of the developing residential area of Montpelier. It was a higher-class district, and more money was spent on the building; it was designed by prolific church architect George Cheesman, Jr. in the Early English Gothic Revival style, and there was a tower with a spire. It was built in 1837‚Äì38 and opened on 26 April 1838. Of the ¬£4,600 cost, the Commissioners for Building New Churches and the Society for the Building and Enlargement of Churches gave ¬£500 each, ¬£50 each came from King William IV, Queen Adelaide and (after her accession) Queen Victoria, Wagner gave ¬£200 and separately paid for the stained glass and the vaults under the church, and other members of the Wagner family gave ¬£420 between them. The church survived until 1982, when it was demolished following fire damage in 1978. St John the Evangelist's Church (now the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity) served the Carlton Hill district. The third of Wagner's churches served Brighton's poorest slum district, Carlton Hill. George Cheesman junior was again commissioned to design the church, which was dedicated to St John the Evangelist. A plain and \\"strangely bleak\\" Classical exterior, dominated by Doric pilasters, led to an \\"elegant\\" galleried interior. The area was so impoverished that Wagner arranged for an endowment fund to be set up, as its worshippers would not be able to support the church financially. This raised nearly ¬£3,000. Construction cost ¬£5,212.7s.11d., and the church opened for worship on 28 January 1840. Wagner and his family contributed much towards it: he gave ¬£200 himself, his wife and father-in-law donated ¬£118.10s. and ¬£265 respectively, and his mother, sister and brother George gave ¬£60 between them. Other donors included Queen Victoria (¬£50), Member of Parliament for Brighton Adolphus Dalrymple (¬£25) and local landowner Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol (¬£100). The Commissioners for Building New Churches and the Society for the Building and Enlargement of Churches gave ¬£1,500 between them as well. St John the Evangelist's Church closed in 1980 and was sold to the Greek Orthodox community in 1985, for whom it now serves as the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity. St Paul's Church on West Street in central Brighton was Wagner's fourth church. It was built specifically for the ministry of his son Arthur, whose ordination was imminent at the time. Construction took place between 1846 and 1848, the church opened on 18 October 1848 and its consecration ceremony took place on 12 October 1849. Three months later, Arthur Wagner became its perpetual curate. \\"The first of the great Gothic [Revival] churches\\" in Brighton, St Paul's cost ¬£12,000 and was designed by Richard Cromwell Carpenter, whose Tractarian \\"High Church\\" views on ecclesiastical architecture and ecclesiology met with Arthur Wagner's approval. As before, part of the cost of the church was met by members of Henry Michell Wagner's family, and he donated ¬£1,475 himself. St Paul's was built near several other centrally located Anglican churches, particularly St Nicholas', the Chapel Royal and Holy Trinity, but it remains in use as an Anglican place of worship. Architecturally and historically, it is \\"one of the great churches of Victorian Brighton\\". Wagner's fifth church was more modest; it \\"attracted little attention during ... its existence\\". All Saints Church stood on Compton Avenue in the West Hill area near Brighton railway station. Richard Cromwell Carpenter was again commissioned to design it, and like St Paul's Church it was a flint-built Gothic Revival structure (this time in the Decorated Gothic style); but there was no tower or spire, and only the \\"beautiful woodwork\\" of the interior gave it any architectural interest. All Saints opened in 1852 and was paid for by various contributors including the Society for the Building and Enlargement of Churches and Henry Michell Wagner himself, who gave ¬£300. It was damaged by bombs in World War II and was demolished in 1957, but its church hall survives. St Peter's Church at West Blatchington, but this did not happen until after his death. Unlike his other churches, Wagner's final church was built as a memorial to a specific man and was funded principally by an endowment from his mother. St Anne's Church on Burlington Street in the East Cliff area near Royal Crescent commemorated Rev. James Churchill, formerly the Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery chaplain. His mother gave ¬£6,600, and more funding came from his aunt. The endowment paid for the running of the church rather than its construction, for which money was given by Wagner himself (¬£2,200), its first Perpetual Curate Rev. Alfred Cooper (¬£2,000), the Society for the Building and Enlargement of Churches (¬£300) and many other subscribers. Benjamin Ferrey designed the church, which opened on 13 June 1863 nearly a year after Wagner laid the first stone. St Anne's Church was declared redundant in 1983 and was demolished three years later, but its flamboyant church hall survives nearby. Under Wagner's guidance, Brighton's parish church was also rebuilt from its state of \\"sad disrepair\\" in 1853‚Äì54 to the design of Richard Cromwell Carpenter. Thomas Walker Horsfield's History, Antiquities and Topography of the County of Sussex (1835) was critical of the \\"tasteless and unsightly edifice\\", and inside it was cramped and old-fashioned, resembling an 18th-century preaching-house. =West Blatchington= Since 1801, the parish of Brighton had been connected with that of nearby West Blatchington as part of the Hundred of Whalesbone. Accordingly, Wagner also held the living of West Blatchington church, although by that time the medieval building had fallen into disrepair and was not used. The village had also declined and had a population of about 80, most of whom were associated with its single farm. Wagner sent curates out to the village to hold services at one of the cottages, but in 1855 he asked the local landowner the Marquess of Abergavenny for permission to rebuild the church. Wagner offered to pay for this and commissioned George Frederick Bodley to design a new building, but the Marquess refused: the tenants of his land did not want to give it up and the residents were said to be happy to walk to St Helen's Church at Hangleton. Disputes and discord With his \\"masterful character\\" and centralised power within the parish of Brighton, Wagner found himself at the centre of regular disputes and controversies. Financial, political and personal clashes marked his incumbency. Arguments over the Church rate levied by the Vestry on every resident within the parish lasted throughout his time in Brighton and were \\"the most bitter cause of strife\\". Wagner's strongly Tory political views were also at odds with the town's Radicalism and set the influential Brighton Herald newspaper against him. =Church rates= Church rates were a common cause of dispute throughout the country in the 19th century as Roman Catholics and Nonconformists became more numerous: these religious communities worshipped outside the Church of England but were legally responsible for the upkeep of the Church's buildings as well as of their own. Because Nonconformism was so strong in Brighton by the time Wagner was ordained, he faced hostility straight away. One of the first branches of the Metropolitan Society for the Abolition of Church Rates outside London was formed in Brighton in 1836. Important public figures were involved: Thomas Read Kemp , Isaac Newton Wigney , Joseph Hume , Sir George Brooke-Pechell, 4th Baronet and several prominent Nonconformists. A Church rate was first proposed at a public meeting at Brighton Town Hall in 1835 which was chaired by Wagner. The proposed 1% rate was voted out in a public poll after Nonconformist opponents tabled an amendment asking for funds to be raised privately by a committee. At meetings in 1836 and 1839, in response to the churchwardens' proposal of 1%, the majority of voters supported the opponents' demands to defer any discussion for six months and a year respectively. In 1840, money was urgently needed for a new burial ground near St Nicholas' Church. A poorly supported public vote supported the Vestry's proposal for a 3% rate; but Wagner's opponents set up a meeting to examine whether the decision was legal and to organise a petition to Parliament demanding the abolition of the Church rate as \\"unjust in principle ... a violation of the rights of conscience and a continual source of discord ... [in] this parish\\". Captain Pechell delivered this petition himself after another meeting in March 1841 when a 2% rate was sought for work at St Peter's Church. Although this rate was voted in, events at the next meeting in October 1841 led to \\"the most notorious incident of Wagner's incumbency\\". At this meeting, another 1% rate was voted out; but in response to a claim by one of Wagner's opponents that it was illegal to charge rates for \\"laying out a burial ground and embellishments to a church\\" (for which purposes the March 1841 rate was levied), the money raised was removed from the parish accounts and the money could not be spent. Accordingly, when the clock on St Peter's Church stopped in November 1841, it was not re-wound because the allocated money was not available. The Vestry stated that as the clock benefited everybody, its maintenance should be met by public funds‚Äîthe Church rate. This was unpopular with the public, and Wagner began to face criticism and \\"petty persecution\\". On 15 January 1842, in response to mockery by a group of boys, he chased one into a house, reprimanded him and hit him with his riding crop. Although the boy's mother supported the vicar's actions, his father sought to prosecute Wagner for assault, and he was recommended to solicitor Sidney Bennett‚Äîone of Wagner's fiercest opponents. He insisted on a summons being issued, and Wagner appeared in front of the magistrates on 20 January 1842. The bench was made up of a mixture of his supporters and opponents, including Isaac Wigney who led proceedings. Wagner was fined ¬£2 (instead of the ¬£5 sought by Bennett), and the incident affected Wagner's reputation in Brighton for the rest of his life. Vestry meetings continued in the same vein for several years, with regular arguments, votes and polls about the levying of rates. Even a favourable High Court ruling in 1847, which should have helped Wagner's cause, did little to deter his opponents. Wagner stopped attending Vestry meetings for a time from 1843 \\"in protest against past bad behavior\\", but soon returned. Meanwhile, St Nicholas' Church was falling into disrepair and was grossly inadequate for the hundreds of poor people who tried to attend services, such that a church rate of several percent would have been needed for a full restoration. In 1852, though, Wagner took decisive action when the Duke of Wellington died: he suggested the church should be rebuilt as a memorial to the Duke, called a meeting to this effect at the Town Hall and pledged ¬£1,000 himself. Eventually nearly ¬£5,000 was raised, and in April 1853 the Bishop granted permission for the church to close for restoration. Richard Cromwell Carpenter, who had recently designed St Paul's Church for Wagner, undertook the restoration at a final cost of ¬£5,769.18s.7d., and the church reopened in April 1854. Church rates, which had severely affected the early part of his incumbency, accordingly ceased to be a problem in 1852; and Wagner's workload was reduced further in 1854 when Brighton was incorporated as a town. Administration passed from the Vestry and the Brighton Commissioners (of which Wagner was a member) to a mayor, 12 aldermen and six elected councillors in each of six wards. =Frederick Robertson= Wagner's reputation in Brighton was damaged again in 1853 when he was an involved in an incident with popular preacher Frederick William Robertson of Holy Trinity Church in Ship Street. In May 1853 Robertson had a mental breakdown which was blamed on overwork. Holy Trinity Church offered to pay for a curate to help ease the burden; but Wagner disapproved of Robertson's choice, Rev. Ernest Tower, and vetoed him. This was apparently due to an earlier disagreement between Tower and Wagner in which Wagner was affronted by Tower's behaviour in connection with a local society. Wagner spoke to Robertson after a service at Holy Trinity about the matter, apparently believing that he would nominate another curate; but Robertson was distressed by the incident and later wrote to Wagner criticising him for his \\"permanent unforgivingness\\" and stating that he could not nominate anybody else. Within three months Robertson had died. Wagner's opponents claimed that he had \\"forced himself upon Robertson, who wanted to go home to rest\\", and that his unreasonable attitude had contributed to Robertson's mental distress and early death at the age of 37. =Purchas affair= Although the Robertson incident \\"probably did Wagner's reputation more harm than any other single incident\\" during his time as Vicar of Brighton, the dispute he had with Rev. John Purchas‚Äîformerly one of his own curates‚Äîwas of greater national significance because of the controversial ritualist practices Purchas brought in when he took over the incumbency of St James's Chapel in Kemptown. Protests spread from Brighton itself to the Bishop of Chichester and then to the Church of England's ecclesiastical court; and the affair took up much of Wagner's time and energy during the last four years of his life. St James's Chapel was one of the three Anglican churches in Brighton at the time Wagner became Vicar of the town. It was owned by Nathaniel Kemp of Ovingdean House, who appointed Rev. C.D. Maitland as Perpetual curate. Under his ministry, \\"services were of the most evangelical tone imaginable\\". When he died in 1865, Purchas bought the building and the right of presentation. He had been influenced by ritualist views while working as a curate at St Paul's Church under Wagner's son Arthur. After maintaining the chapel's evangelical style of services for several months, Purchas changed to a strongly ritualist style of worship from September 1866. The clergy wore full vestments, Purchas himself wore a cope and biretta, and incense was used throughout the service. At a time when Roman Catholicism was still viewed with suspicion and animosity, such Catholic-style practices raised \\"an immediate outcry\\" among the clergy at other local churches. Wagner received letters claiming that Purchas was trying to \\"un- Protestantise our Protestant Church\\" and that the blame lay with his son, Arthur Wagner, whose introduction of ritualist services at St Paul's Church \\"introduced the seeds of division into the Church in Brighton\\". Purchas relented for a time, but after further complaints in 1868 he reacted by inviting 1,500 people to a special service at the chapel in September of that year, at which ultra-ritualist practices were given full rein. Amid negative publicity from The Times, Wagner tried to stop his former curate from continuing in this vein, but was rebuffed. He involved the Bishop of Chichester, but Purchas gave the same reply: because he owned the chapel, he could do as he wished‚Äîeven when the Bishop banned him from ministering anywhere in the diocese. Riots ensued inside and outside the chapel, and the Bishop appealed to the Court of Arches, the Church of England's ecclesiastical court. The matter was not finally settled until after Wagner's death. Wagner's actions throughout the controversy attempted to demonstrate \\"tolerance and restraint\\": he terminated Purchas's position as a curate at St Nicholas' Church, made it clear that he was unimpressed by deliberately ostentatious ritualist practices, and stated that he tried to ensure that \\"every phase of religious opinion within [the Church of England]\\" should be fairly represented in Brighton, so that every Anglican could worship according to their wishes. Nevertheless, he found himself in the middle of a scandal in which \\"the press had a field day\\" and which had brought the Anglican Church in Brighton to national attention. Later life and death Henry Michell Wagner had various health problems in his middle and old age. He had an operation to repair a fistula in 1833. Then in 1855, he suffered an unknown feverish illness which was so severe it was expected to lead to his death. Helped by the \\"devoted\\" attention of his housekeeper, he was out of danger by the autumn; to help his recovery he travelled to Malta and Egypt during the winter. He sailed from Valletta to Alexandria on board a P&O; steamship, on which he spent much time with Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet, then spent a month in Cairo‚Äîwhere he suffered more health problems. He abandoned a proposed trip to Jerusalem and sailed back to Malta, but was made even more ill by the inadequate food on board: too weak to eat proper meals, he could only manage gruel. In the 1860s he suffered from increasingly frequent bouts of gout and was left with a permanent limp. He then suffered another serious illness in 1864. He managed to continue his regular activities until just before his death, though: he would get up at 3am, did not go to bed until 8pm or 9pm, continued to administer parish affairs on his own, and always visited sick parishioners himself rather than delegating the responsibility to his curates. His final illness came in September 1870. He preached as normal on 18 September and attended a meeting with the Bishop of Chichester Richard Durnford the following day, but afterwards he was confined to bed by complications of his chronic gout. He died at lunchtime on 7 October 1870, just short of his 78th birthday, with his son Arthur in attendance. His funeral, \\"which must have been one of the grandest ever held in Brighton\\", was on 15 October 1870 at St Nicholas' Church and was attended by every Anglican clergyman from Brighton, civic leaders, pupils of the schools he founded and many other people. Every Anglican church in Brighton was decorated with black. Wagner was succeeded as Vicar of Brighton by Reverend John Hannah. Legacy Wagner helped the Swan Downer School move to this new building at 11 Dyke Road, Brighton. As well as building several churches in Brighton, Henry Michell Wagner founded or assisted many social, educational and charitable causes in the town. \\"His charitable activities ... probably formed the best side of his work in Brighton\\". Soon after he arrived in Brighton, he started raising money for the Royal Sussex County Hospital, which was under construction at the time. Of the ¬£15,000 construction cost, ¬£6,000 had already been raised by its founder Thomas Read Kemp and George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont; Wagner was the main fundraiser for the remainder and donated some money himself, as did his brother George. He was on the management board and the board of governors for the rest of his life, and played an active part in the running of the hospital. He also selected the hospital's first chaplain‚ÄîRev. J. Anderson, curate of nearby St George's Church. An earlier healthcare facility was the Brighton Dispensary (founded in 1809), which was partly superseded by the Royal Sussex County Hospital but changed its focus and expanded in 1850. Wagner led this expansion, and the institution survived until the mid-20th century. Wagner was also involved with the Eye Infirmary (as vice-president and a trustee), the Blind Asylum and the Deaf and Dumb Asylum (both as president), and the Board of Guardians of the Poor (for which he was a director from 1824 until his death). Until the Elementary Education Act 1870 was passed, there was no centralised provision of schooling for children below secondary level. Churches, private individuals and charitable institutions provided what they could. The Church of England-led National Society for Promoting Religious Education had the objective of founding schools, which became known as National Schools. There were none in Brighton in 1824, when Wagner arrived in the town; by the time of his death in 1870, he had founded nine, including the architecturally magnificent Church Street National School in the North Laine. Built in 1829 in an elaborate Gothic Revival style, it was infamously demolished in 1971 when its application for listed status was delayed by a postal strike. Wagner was also \\"instrumental in securing\\" the Swan Downer School's move from a cramped building in the North Laine to purpose-built premises at 11 Dyke Road. Swan Downer, a rich merchant from Brighton, had provided in his will for the foundation of a school for poor girls. Wagner was involved with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: he became vice-president of the newly formed Sussex branch in 1869, and since 1842 had given the society ¬£20 per year. He was also vice- president of the Sussex branch of the Early Closing Association, and in 1856 agreed to pay an annual subscription of ¬£10.10s. to the newly formed Brighton Scripture Readers Association. The Percy and Wagner Almshouses were partly funded by Wagner and his sister Mary. The first six houses were built in 1795 in an isolated position on the Lewes Road; Wagner added another six (three on each end) in 1859. The small cottages are of yellow brick and in the Gothic Revival style and are Grade II-listed. Commemorations St Martin's Church (1872‚Äì75) was built to commemorate Henry Michell Wagner. St Martin's Church on the Lewes Road, near the Percy and Wagner Almshouses, was built for Arthur Wagner and his brothers in memory of their father. George Somers Clarke junior, whose father was a long-time friend of Henry Michell Wagner, was the architect. Brighton's largest church is austere outside, belying the \\"breathtaking magnificence\\" of its opulent interior. The font (dating from 1875, when the church was finished) is inlaid with marble collected by Henry Michell Wagner during his European travels. The Church Street National School featured a bust of Wagner carved by John Edward Carew, but it was destroyed during the building's demolition. Another bust survives in the Brighton Museum, though. After Wagner recovered from severe illness in 1855, he paid ¬£150 for a Clayton and Bell-designed stained glass window at Chichester Cathedral. Themes of healing were depicted in the artwork. The window was destroyed by World War II bombing. Wagner is also commemorated by a stained glass window at St Nicholas' Church, which was presented to the church by his friend Somers Clarke. He was a solicitor who served as Clerk to the Vestry of Brighton for more than 60 years, and was the father of the architect of St Martin's Church. Personal life and character=Marriages= Wagner's first recorded meeting with Elizabeth Harriott Douglas came on 13 November 1820, and they became engaged in late 1821. She was the daughter of William Douglas (1768‚Äì1819), the Precentor of Salisbury Cathedral and Archdeacon of Wilts, and the granddaughter of John Douglas, whose ecclesiastical positions included Bishop of Salisbury between 1791 and 1807. They were married on 20 March 1823 at St James's Church, Piccadilly, after which they travelled to Brighton to stay with Wagner's mother at her house, 49 Old Steine. After spending a week in Brighton, where they attended the Chapel Royal and met the Vicar of Brighton Dr Robert James Carr, they travelled to Herstmonceux to visit George Wagner. Henry Michell Wagner is said to have \\"read prayers at Herstmonceux church\\" on Easter Sunday. They moved into Wagner's house at Eton on 12 April 1823. On 13 June 1824, their son Arthur Douglas Wagner was born at Park Hill in Windsor, a house belonging to Elizabeth Harriott Wagner's family. He was named Arthur in honour of the Duke of Wellington. During this period they made plans to move to nearby Winkfield. The vicar of its parish church was a relative of Elizabeth, and Henry Michell Wagner assisted there‚Äîeffectively \\"act[ing] as an unpaid curate\\". This later caused controversy among his religious opponents in Brighton. Elizabeth (known as Zimmie) suffered health problems after Arthur's birth. She was diagnosed with oedema, and despite regular fluid-letting and the pursuit of some questionable remedies (\\"she was electrified and [received] 64 strokes\\" according to one diary entry), by 1829 she could hardly stand or walk. On 27 November 1829, at the age of 32, she died at the old vicarage in Nile Street. Henry Michell Wagner's mother and unmarried sister moved in to help bring up Arthur. They continued to live in the vicarage until their deaths in 1844 and 1868 respectively. His mother was buried at St Nicholas' Church in the Michell family vault, as was his first wife; his sister's grave is in Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery. In 1838 Wagner married Mary Sikes Watson, the 38-year-old daughter of Joshua Watson‚Äîa prominent High churchman and philanthropist. She was \\"a ... lady of too great Victorian piety for comfort\\": letters between her and Wagner during their courtship discussed administrative matters and philosophical principles rather than love and romance. The marriage produced two sons‚ÄîJoshua Watson Wagner (b. 29 May 1839) and Henry Wagner (b. 16 July 1840)‚Äîbut Mary died on 20 July 1840 because of complications with the latter birth. She was also buried in the family vault at St Nicholas' Church. =Religious views= Wagner was an \\"old style High churchman\\" with \\"pre- Tractarian\\" rather than fully Tractarian views. The influence of his second wife's father Joshua Watson‚Äî\\"a leader of the High Church movement\\" in the mid-19th century‚Äîmay have been significant. He never had the ritualist zeal of his son Arthur Douglas Wagner, though, and had concerns over his views and the way he ministered at St Paul's Church. Invited to preach there by Arthur, he chose as his text on one occasion \\"Lord, have mercy upon my son for he is lunatic and sore vexed\\". () Wagner was a \\"zealous, devoted clergyman\\". His strength of character meant he would not compromise his principles for anybody. King William IV once visited Brighton on a Sunday. All church bells in the town were traditionally rung to herald a king's visit, but when asked what he would do Wagner replied \\"on a Sunday, the bells are rung only for the King of Kings\\". (The famously pious Queen Adelaide was delighted by this response.) He was also very wealthy, which allowed him to act as \\"the best kind of benevolent despot\\": using his money both to help as many residents as he could and to wield great influence within Brighton. Under his guidance, the town effectively became \\"a bishopric within a bishopric\\" in the words of the Bishop of Chichester. Throughout his life, the town was still covered by one large parish of which St Nicholas' was the parish church and the other Anglican churches merely chapels of ease. He was permitted by law to choose perpetual curates for each chapel of ease; accordingly he had overall control of the whole parish and each church within it. Wagner was opposed to pew rents, though not so strongly as his son. When St Paul's Church opened, Arthur wanted all 1,200 seats to be free, but Henry held the more old-fashioned view that there should be a mix. Accordingly, 460 pews were for rent and the rest were free; Arthur Wagner abolished all rented pews in 1873 after his father's death. The controversial subject caused Henry Wagner problems at other times. In 1858, his nephew Rev. Thomas Coombe‚ÄîPerpetual curate of All Saints Church‚Äîgot into a disagreement with him after altering the interior to add extra pews for rent, and tried to prevent Wagner entering the church. Wagner had to appeal to the Bishop of Chichester Ashurst Gilbert to deal with the situation. The events of 1824 and St Margaret's Chapel also left Wagner with \\"an enduring dislike of proprietary chapels\\". In his 46 years as Vicar of Brighton, during an era when their construction was commonplace, he allowed no others to be built after St Margaret's, St George's, Holy Trinity and St Mary's were completed (the last of these opened in 1827.) When the rector of St Christopher's Church, Lympsham offered in 1858 to pay for a new proprietary chapel in Brighton with 100 free pews and 200 for rent, both Wagner and his sister wrote to him \\"kindly but firmly\\" describing his \\"insuperable objection\\" to such chapels. As Vicar of Brighton, he gained the right of presentation after each proprietary chapel had been open for 40 years; but in 1856 the Marquess of Blandford tried to abolish this right by raising a bill before Parliament. Wagner, who \\"clung firmly to the rights of presentation\\" he expected to receive, tried to persuade the Marquess to exclude Brighton's four proprietary chapels from the bill‚Äîfirst by going through his solicitor friend Somers Clarke, then by asking Brighton MPs Lord Alfred Hervey (1816‚Äì1875) and Sir George Brooke-Pechell, 4th Baronet for their support. The bill did not pass into law, and the right of presentation did eventually pass to Wagner in each case. =Character= Always a strong and assertive character, Wagner was not afraid to challenge behaviour and people he disapproved of. In 1822, when the then 15-year-old Marquess of Douro was behaving arrogantly towards the household's servants, Wagner hit him and wrote a strongly worded letter to the Duchess of Wellington criticising the boy as \\"haughty in the extreme\\" and the Duchess's own attitude: \\"There is a veil before your eyes. You overlook Douro's faults\\". Likewise, when conducting evensong at St Peter's Church one evening in 1834, he saw two military officers talking and misbehaving. \\"He strode down the aisle ... and stationed himself between them for the rest of the service\\", and when they asked for an apology for the embarrassment caused to them he instead demanded that they apologise for their conduct, otherwise he would write to his friend the Duke of Wellington and inform him about his officers' behaviour. An incident in January 1824, in which the house at Eton was broken into and money stolen from Wagner's pupils, also \\"throws a good deal of light on his character\\". He initially set out to find the thief‚Äîby engaging the police, using his own efforts and enlisting the help of one of a gang of beggars who often loitered around the house. Wagner captured the offender himself; he was a man whom Wagner had employed for several years despite incidents of improper conduct, because the man's father had persuaded him to give him another chance. As soon as he captured the man, \\"Wagner's reaction to the crime completely changed, and compassion became his dominant consideration\\". The death penalty was applied to crimes of burglary in which more than five shillings was stolen; Wagner attempted to get the charge changed to one of felony, and stated that only three shillings was stolen when in fact the man took ¬£2.3s. Wagner later signed a petition for clemency which was presented to King George IV, and the man was spared the death sentence. A sense of fairness and personal responsibility was also demonstrated in his reaction to the Marquess of Abergavenny's refusal to allow the rebuilding and reopening of St Peter's Church, West Blatchington. Wagner had asked George Frederick Bodley to produce a plan; when the project was cancelled, he decided to pay Bodley ¬£10.10s. as partial compensation for the fee he would have received, as it was \\"the proper and liberal thing to do\\". One of Wagner's main strengths was his speaking‚Äîboth as a preacher (the Brighton Gazettes obituary praised his \\"short ... clear, pointed and vigorous\\" sermons) and when making appeals for political or financial purposes. His great financial generosity helped his appeals be so successful. Overall, he gave ¬£3,327 to the various churchbuilding and restoration projects he was involved in during his time as Vicar of Brighton‚Äîa large sum for the time. Wagner wrote a diary for many years. This was more a factual list of events than an expression of his feelings, and when any emotion was demonstrated it was always \\"in a very restrained way\\" and was usually written in Latin, Italian or French. For example, after an evening spent with his future wife Elizabeth, his diary entry for the day read \\"O qual gioja!\\" (Oh what joy!). On another occasion, though, after two evenings in her company he commented \\"Quem deus vult perdere, prius dementat\\" (Those whom God would destroy, He first makes mad). Wagner was fond of entertainment and socialising. He regularly played cards until late at night‚Äîalthough he admonished himself in his diary for doing so‚Äîand was a keen tennis and billiards player. He also attended horse races and theatre productions both before and after his ordination. Earlier in his life he played a lot of cricket and enjoyed horseriding. He was comfortable in the presence of royalty, with whom he regularly mixed because of his association with the Duke and Duchess of Wellington. He was invited to see both the Duke of Kent and King George III lying in state, attended King George III's funeral, attended the coronation of King George IV as the guest of the Duke and Duchess, and visited the new king's cottage at Windsor Park‚Äîabout which he wrote in his diary \\"little interesting is to be seen\\". King William IV often invited him to parties and events at the Royal Pavilion, and Queen Adelaide and the late King George III's daughter Princess Augusta Sophia were also on friendly terms with him. =Opponents and controversies= \\"So common during the 46 years of Wagner's ministry\\" in Brighton was the scenario of Wagner being at odds with people in the town: colleagues within the Church of England, religious and political opponents, members of the public and others. A man of strong views, he disliked opposition \\"and was unforgiving to those who had opposed him in the past\\". He mellowed later in life, though, and was always much more forgiving and tolerant of the rare ecclesiastical disagreements he was involved in than of the three types of dispute which characterised his time in Brighton. These were political disagreements, clashes of personality and financial disputes. His greatest difficulties occurred in Vestry meetings when battles were fought over Church rates. Although on one occasion Wagner was formally \\"censure[d] ... for his improper conduct in the chair\\", and often acted in a \\"high-handed\\" fashion as chairman, he always treated his opponents courteously‚Äîeven when meetings became so heated that they reputedly threatened to throw him down the Town Hall's stairs. Influential opponents included John Colbatch (owner of the Albion Hotel), Presbyterian minister Rev. James Edwards, local Quaker Isaac Bass, and Lt-Col. Thomas Trusty Trickey. These men often abused Wagner and disrupted meetings by filibustering; Trickey has been called the main antagonist. In contrast, the minister of Union Chapel Rev. John Nelson Goulty maintained good relations with Wagner despite their regular debates and disagreements. Goulty served the Nonconformist community for the same length of time as Wagner served the Anglican church, and their influence over their respective communities was similar. Wagner's confident and forthright manner of defending compulsory rates and supporting the Vestry led one of his main opponents to remark in 1852 \\"although you have many faults, I am proud of you ... if you had gone into the army, you would, with your indomitable energy and your great ability, have made a second Wellington\\". Politically, Wagner was a High Tory: this made him \\"very unpopular in zealous Whig circles\\" during a time when there was great hostility between the parties‚Äîespecially in Brighton, which was dominated by radical Whig views. Wagner's experiences with Barnard Gregory and St Margaret's Chapel showed that he could sometimes compromise in the spirit of conciliation, but the reasons for his opposition to Edward Everard's appointment as Perpetual curate are unknown. Although Everard gave up the position in 1828, he was still active locally as rector of St Michael and All Angels Church, Southwick, founder and first incumbent of St Andrew's Church, Brunswick Town, and chaplain of the King's private chapel. His motivation for founding St Andrew's Church, a chapel of ease to Hove's parish church, may have been \\"to remove himself from Wagner's jurisdiction\\" in neighbouring Brighton. During his 11-year incumbency (1828‚Äì1839) there, Everard \\"played a very prominent part in the ecclesiastical life\\" of the Diocese of Chichester and for a time was more influential locally than Wagner himself.

He had an especial interest in seventeenth- century poetry and in manuscripts from this period. He was educated at St Paul's Cathedral School, where he sang as a chorister at the funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965, and at The King's School, Canterbury. He went from there to read History at Christ Church Oxford, taking the best First in his year at Finals. (John Milbank was, on his own account, a less successful contemporary.) An account of Maule's time as an undergraduate recalls him as a man, Maule went on to work for seven years as a researcher in the House of Lords library (his acquaintance Philip Hensher later held a similar position). But his love of English literature caused Maule to return to academia via a part-time degree in medieval studies at Birkbeck College and an Oxford doctorate that was never completed to temporary teaching posts at Oxford colleges. A prot√©g√© of Anne Barton, he was appointed in 1986 to a permanent Fellowship at her college in Cambridge, Trinity, where he taught for the remainder of his life. A don of the old school, he was resident in college and readily embraced the responsibility of teaching by tutorial, being more concerned with inspiring those he taught and supervised than with producing publications of his own. Most of his published scholarship accordingly appeared posthumously, edited by his colleagues and students. Nonetheless, during his lifetime Maule was the editor, with his colleague Adrian Poole, of the Oxford Book of Classical Verse in Translation (1995). Following his early death a bequest from Maule's will also helped bring to fruition a project he had long cherished: the creation of Renaissance Texts from Manuscript (RTM), a scholarly press for the publication of unprinted sixteenth- and seventeenth- century manuscripts. Four volumes appeared, under the general editorship of Marie Axton, on subjects as diverse as dance, female (auto)biography, and rhetoric, reflecting Maule's own multifarious interests and exacting qualities as an editor. As this suggests, Maule had a particular interest in manuscript research‚Äìlatterly he taught post-medieval palaeography to graduate literature students in Cambridge‚Äìand himself made a number of significant discoveries. The most important of these was his identification in 1997 of an unknown manuscript treatise by Thomas Traherne entitled 'The Kingdom of God' in Lambeth Palace Library. He also brought to light unknown records bearing upon on the early biography of John Milton, a poem by John Ford, and two manuscripts of Elizabeth Cary's play Edward II. At his death he was engaged in producing editions of the poetry of Mildmay Fane, second earl of Westmorland, and also Andrew Marvell's Mr. Smirke; Or, the Divine in Mode. He became increasingly interested in women's writing of the seventeenth-century and was the co-convenor of the Trinity/Trent Colloquium in the field. Maule had a huge circle of friends across the world, most of them scholars, offering them hospitality during visits to Cambridge in tacit exchange for scholarly conversation (what he called 'the higher gossip') . He sported a full beard (and, in later life, piercings), which he deployed conversationally. His next- door colleague at St John's College, Cambridge, John Kerrigan, described him as a 'convivial but private, institutionally committed but elusive' man. Maule succumbed to complications arising from HIV infection. His funeral and memorial service were held in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, with many of those he taught taking part in the ceremonies. Maule is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge. His students included Philip West (Somerville College, Oxford), Heather Wolfe (Folger Shakespeare Library), and Andrew Zurcher (Queens' College, Cambridge).

Today, in the visual system the left visual field is represented in the right hemisphere and the right visual field in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, the visual fields are represented upside down in the brain. The physical cause is only the change from a convex eye that is turned to the environment, like an insect eye, to a retracted, concave retina (Figure 1 and 2).* In addition, the right hemisphere controls the left part of the body, and the left hemisphere controls the right part of the body. These circumstances are caused by evolution, protection of the retina and maintenance of motor control and self defense after injury on the injured side of the body.  Evolution of the retina  During eye evolution there existed an additional convex stadium of the retina (Figure 1, Left), presumably, which explains why today the left visual field is represented in the right hemisphere and vice versa. With the change from convex to concave retinas, the visual input changed sides on the retina, and was represented upside down in addition. During evolution existed a convex stadium of the retina.  Embryonal development of the retina  Evolutionary stages are sometimes conserved in developmental stages, which serve as a proof for stages during evolution. The convex stadium is also mirrored in the embryonal development in the form of the optic vesicle (Figure 2). Also insects have convex eyes which supports the notion of a previous convex stadium too (**). Originally, when the retinas were turned outside, the left visual field of the eye went to the left part of the retina and the left hemisphere, and the right to the right (Figure 1, Left); back then the motor control must have been direct. For the protection of the retina, the retina was retracted into the body. But after the retina was retracted, the light reached the retina vice versa (Figure 1) and upside down. Now the right visual field of the eye reaches the left part of the retina but still the left hemisphere, and vice versa. This explains why the right visual field of the eye connects today to the left hemisphere and vice versa. Furthermore, it additionally explains why everything is represented upside down in the brain. The convex stadium of the retina during evolution is mirrored in the embryonal development in form of the optic vesicle.  Motor control  The efferent motor neurons on the other hand adapted to the new situation and crossed. Like that the visual input on one side still controls the corresponding side of the body and hence the motor control on that side. So the right hemisphere controls the left part of the body and vice versa, which has in addition the advantage that the motor control and self defense can be maintained after injury on the injured side. It would make sense that the same mechanism also leads to the change from a convex to a concave retina, at least at the beginning of eye evolution. The change of sides could be caused by a protein like Myosin D1, which causes asymmetry, or a similar protein.  Eye architecture  The change in the architecture within the eye, from convex to concave, also explains why afferent nerves are located on the retina. It is due to the photo receptors retracting through the afferent nerves.  Principle of the evolution of senses  The evolution of the retina could also hint at a principle about the evolution of senses of bigger animals, namely the retina and the ear: First they are turned to the environment, but for their protection they are retracted into the body. Today the eyes are our most important sense with 90% of our perception being visual. Since most efferent motor neurons are crossed it seems that the CNS evolution is strongly influenced by the visual input. (*) This leads to an inverted representation of the visual fields in the brain - they crosse sides and are represented upside down. (**) They only remained convex because insects can flee and bring their eyes into security fast enough. Our ancestors were bigger, less mobile and hence could not save their eyes fast enough by movement; because of that the retina was retracted into the body for its protection - during evolution (and development).

Its name derives from a chief who inhabited the region, and name six of the lounges are related to Amerindian culture: Bochica, Tairona, Quimbaya, Kat√≠o, Bachu√©, and Nutabe. The hotel's restaurant is La Orqu√≠dea. History Hotel Nutibara was designed by American architect Paul Williams, who was not well known in Medell√≠n prior to this building. Plans for a hotel in central Medell√≠n were proposed in 1937, and Hotel Nutibara was established in 1945. History book on Hotel Nutibara The idea of its foundation began in 1936, when Medell√≠n had only 150,000 inhabitants. By then, the Assembly of Antioquia, through Ordinance number 10, authorized the governor of the Department, Alberto Jaramillo S√°nchez, to promote the construction of the work that would translate the ideals of the \\"Company of the Hotel Nutibara SA\\", on April 22, 1936 . Four years later, in September 1940, the demolition of the buildings built on the grounds for the Hotel and another five more began. On July 18, 1945, the Nutibara Hotel was inaugurated. \\"The Nutibara Hotel is an example of all the modernist architecture of the 1940s, which predates the architecture of the modern movement, in which the city developed with expressions such as the American art deco by Paul Williams, which marks its aesthetics and its form. The Europa Hotel already existed, which shows that there was an opening towards tourism, but the elites of the city believed that it was not adequate, that a more modern one was needed, that it had the capacity to offer and greater aesthetics \\", Luis Fernando Gonz√°lez Escobar, director of the School of Habitat of the National University of Colombia, Medell√≠n, reports. Memories and stories As of its opening, famous guests arrived at the Hotel Nutibara: \\"Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen, Mariano Ospina P√©rez, D√©bora Arango, Belisario Betancur, Eduardo Santos, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez\\", are some of the names of its current manager, Laura Sierra, who also remembers the visits of \\"Andr√©s Cepeda, Pel√©, Willie Col√≥n and Chavela Vargas\\". \\"Currently celebrities are still visiting us. For example, Los Visconti, Tormenta y B√°rbara, singers, as well as other guests who have been loyal to the Hotel for 40 years, \\"says Sierra. In that perspective, the representative of artists Manuela Villada P√©rez says that \\"when we sometimes make contracts with stars that came to Medell√≠n in decades like the 60s, 70s and 80s, they ask us to be hosted in Nutibara, they describe it as a jewel\\". The surroundings of the Hotel have memories for many, as is the case of Miguel √Ångel Betancur, who in his stories tells that his father, the sculptor Jorge Horacio Betancur, \\"together with the teacher Rafael S√°enz, took his students to an open-air school in Plazuela Nutibara, seeking support from government entities, approached art, that place was very important \\".

Built of limestone ashlar blocks, arranged in alternating layers of headers and stretchers, it is accessed through two doors at right angles to each other. The outer door to the north has a pointed horseshoe arch while the inner door to the east leads into the ground floor which was once converted into a chapel.

There are two upper floors in the tower, each with hemispherical vaulting. From the first floor, the city walls can be accessed through rounded arches to the north and south. The three rounded arches in the eastern wall once housed the chapel bells. There is disagreement as to whether the tower is of 12th-century Almohad origin or was built later during the Christian period.

The park was converted from an incomplete mansion, known as the palace in the sky. It was built during the Marcos era to host the visit of US President Ronald Reagan. Work stopped when Reagan canceled his visit. The incomplete scaffolding of the mansion remained intact. The Shrine of Our Lady, Mother of Fair Love and a Doppler weather radar station maintained by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) is also within the park.Pagasa - Dost - Dost Service Institutes History Imelda Marcos decided to build a mansion on top of Mount Sungay, which was at that time land owned by the government. The summit before was used by the Bureau of Air Transport as a radar station. Construction in the mansion began in 1981, and the work was a difficult due to the height of the summit. Roads were built specially for this purpose enabling supplies to reach the summit of the 2,500 ft Mount Gonzales. The mountain was leveled by bulldozers, and farmers living on the mountainside were asked to relocate. Construction of the mansion was hastened when US President Ronald Reagan announced his intention to visit the Philippines in November, 1983. It was reported that the Marcos administration planned to accommodate Reagan at the then-completed mansion. Post-People Power Revolution critics of the Marcos administration described the unfinished mansion as a symbol of the Marcos administration's excess. Marian chapel The chapel at the park The Shrine of Our Lady, Mother of Fair Love is located within the People's Park in the Sky. The shrine was installed on December 15, 1974, with the installation of the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the child Jesus by Hernan D. Reyes, aided by four high school students and two workers. During the construction of the Palace in the Sky in 1981, workers were unable to blast a huge rock containing the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary with several dynamite blasts. The rock was left intact, after the discovery of the image.

Both commuter rail and funicular are operated by Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya, who also run the station. The station has twin tracks on the main line, with twin side platforms. The main part of each side platform is in tunnel, and only long enough to accommodate two cars, although narrow extensions in the open air of the Sarri√† side of the station allow passenger to disembark from, but not board, a third car. When four car trains are used, the car at the Vall√®s end of the train stops beyond the station and the doors do not open. Stairs, lifts and a footbridge connect these two platforms with the street level station entrance above, and with the funicular terminus above that. The first station on the site opened in 1906, when it was the terminus of the line from Sarri√†, providing an interchange with the funicular that allowed passengers to continue their journey to Vallvidrera on the hill above. In 1916, the Collserola tunnel, and the line onward to the Vall√®s opened. As a result, the station's platforms moved to their current, partly underground location.

The task of the sobor was the decision of a number of disciplinary matters in respect of which was issued two rulings. However, the more he remembered as the cathedral, which was a question about the monastery's tenure. However, no conciliar decree to this effect is unknown. The sobor was convened with the initiative of Simon, Metropolitan of Moscow.

The first stage of the cathedral: the question of representation duties  Cathedral in 1503, in contrast to Vladimir's Sobor of 1274 limited the size of representation duties, levied when issuing letters of representation. The Sobor (Council) of 1503 condemned the charging of fees for the ordination of priests as simony, though the practice had been approved by the Moscow Council of 1270 and had been practiced in the Byzantine church for years before that. As a result of the condemnation, Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod was condemned the following year for simony and removed from office.E. E.

Obvious breach that is not without reason pointed Judaic heretics demanded action. First of all, it concerned widowed priests. It is known that the apostolic rules based directly on the Gospel, the priest can be married only once, \\"the husband of one wife \\". Widowed priests, unafraid to break the church statutes, often entered into a second marriage. Recalling metropolitans Saints Peter and Photios, mentioning the apostolic rule, however, without naming them, Cathedral widowed priests decided not to serve, the same as those entered into a second marriage, be defrocked priests and all rights. Others may serve in the choir, one-fourth of what the employee gets in their place the priest may receive Communion at the altar, wearing a stole. Another decree concerned the so-called \\"double\\" monasteries in which monks lived together both sexes. Cathedral insisted on the necessity of their settlement . In the women's monasteries also should serve the secular clergy. Another decree forbade serve Liturgy drunk and hungover. Not all met positively ban serve widowed priests. Unobjectionable indiscriminately with which the Cathedral approached this issue . The initiator of this decision believe St. Joseph, whose writing has been included in the text \\"Stoglavy\\" (Chapter 79).

They are part of a complex of buildings bought and expanded by Margot Asquith, wife of the then Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, from 1911 and which formed their country home until his death in 1928. Renovations and expansions were undertaken by the architect Walter Cave and were funded by a number of Margot Asquith's friends and admirers. Margot sold the complex in 1932, and the houses have subsequently been in separate ownership. In 2006, Helena Bonham Carter, Asquith's great- granddaughter bought back Mill House. All three properties are Grade II listed buildings. History Margot Asquith bought the Wharf from her friend Maud Tree in 1911. Financial support was provided by Margot's admirer, the banker J. P. Morgan. In 1917, she acquired the Mill House to provide additional guest accommodation. On this occasion, financial support was obtained from Lady Boot, wife of the \\"Chemist to the Nation\\", Jesse Boot. Her architect throughout was Walter Cave. At the time the Asquiths lived there, and until a county reorganisation in 1974, Sutton Courtenay was located in Berkshire and is referred to as being in Berkshire in the many diaries and collections of letters which mention the house. The most recent Pevsner, although published in 2010, also follows this convention. Asquith was addicted to \\"weekending\\" and many Friday-to-Mondays were spent at the Wharf. Asquith died at the house on the morning of 5 February 1928. His daughter Violet recorded his last weeks: \\"To watch Father's glorious mind breaking up and sinking - like a great ship - is a pain beyond all my imagining. I did not know life could be as cruel as this\\". Asquith is buried in the churchyard at Sutton Courtenay. In 1932, facing continuing financial worries, Margot sold the house. In 2012 Asquith's great-grandson, Raymond, unveiled a Blue plaque at the Wharf commemorating Asquith's residence at the house. In 2006, Mill House was bought by Asquith's great-granddaughter, the actress Helena Bonham Carter and her then partner, the director Tim Burton. In 2007, the Wharf was placed on the market. Architecture and description The Mill House Asquith's grandson, Mark Bonham Carter, described the house in his Introduction to Margot Asquith's autobiography, republished in 1962. \\"It was an unattractive house and did not escape the vulgarity which hangs around the Thames Valley.\\" Pevsner describes Cave's overall style as \\"neo-William-and-Mary\\". The Wharf is a two-storey house constructed built with English bond red bricks. The Mill House is also in brick and dates from the 18th century with earlier elements, and later additions undertaken by Cave. Walton House, again in red brick, although this time in Flemish bond, is early 19th century, again with Cave- designed embellishments. The barn in the grounds of the Wharf, overlooking the River Thames, was converted by Cave into a retreat for Margot Asquith in 1913. The Wharf, Mill House and Walton House all have Grade II designations. The Barn is also listed Grade II.

Quoting his friends he wrote in one of his letters:Albert Szenczi Moln√°r's letter to Georg Rem, 18 September 1610. In: Szenczi 1984. p. 207. His pioneering Latin-Hungarian dictionaries (Dictionarium Latinovngaricvm and Dictionarivm Vngarico-Latinvm, both 1604), were, with several revisions, still in use until the first half of the 19th century. He defined much literary and scientific terminology in the Hungarian language for the first time. His Hungarian grammar in Latin was used as a guidebook until the 18th century, through which ‚Äì apart from its significance in the history of science ‚Äì his work greatly contributed to the unification of Hungarian language and spelling. His Psalm translations, the revised editions of the Vizsoly Bible, John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion and the Heidelberg Catechism all represent living heritage. He had an outstanding influence on Hungarian literature and poetry.  Career  His great- grandfather came from Sz√©kely Land and fought in the siege of Naples as a soldier of Matthias Corvinus. After the siege he settled in Pozsony County. He named his son according to his occupation as Molitoris, so Moln√°r. This was the name also of his grandson, who was the father of Albert Szenczi Moln√°r and lived in the market town of Szenc (today: Senec, Slovakia) and worked as a mason miller. At the time of Albert‚Äôs birth his father was quite rich but soon he became poor. After his death in 1603 his family lived in extreme poverty.D√©zsi 1897; Zov√°nyi 1977; Benk≈ë 1984: 15; Szenczi 1984: 165; Nagy 2008: 259. Albert Moln√°r began his studies in his hometown on 7 September 1584. After the death of his mother in 1585 he was studying in Gy≈ër for five months, for one and a half years starting from 1857 in G√∂nc, and finally from 1588 until the summer of 1590 in Debrecen. In G√∂nc as the company of G√°sp√°r K√°roli he was present at the translation and printing of the Vizsoly Bible.

In 1590 at first he was a preceptor in Kassa (today: Ko≈°ice, Slovakia), and then on 1 November he went on a field trip abroad. First of all he visited the birthplace of reformation, Wittenberg. In the summer of 1591 he studied in Dresden in the Holy Cross high school (Gymnasium zum Heiligen Kreuz), in autumn again in Wittenberg, and finally in Heidelberg in 1592. On 1 May he travelled to Strasbourg, where he was accepted to the Collegium Wilhelmiticum as an alumnus. In the summer of 1596 he visited Geneva, where he met the elderly Theodore Beza. When returning to Strasbourg he continued his studies, but in the same year due to his Calvinism, he was banished from that Lutheran town. He returned to Germany only after a long journey in Switzerland and Italy. On 4 December 1596 he was accepted to the Casimirianum at Heidelberg as a student of theology. On 22 January 1597 he matriculated to university, where he studied until 1599.Zov√°nyi 1977; Szenczi 1984: 77; Giebermann 2005: 8.; Nagy 2008: 259. Grave of Szenczi Moln√°r (Cimitirul Hajongard, Cluj-Napoca) At the end of October 1599, after nine years of wandering abroad he returned home to obtain patrons among the Protestant nobility. He stayed in Szenc until 1600, and traveled all around Upper Hungary. In March 1600 he went back to Germany, and turned up in several cities (Altdorf, Heidelberg, Speyer, and Frankfurt). Since 23 November he studied in Herborn (Hesse). He got his certificate from Johannes Piscator on 19 July 1601 who wanted him to be a teacher of the institution, but it was not possible. In 1601 he worked as a proofreader for Johannes Saur‚Äôs publishing house, and in 1602 as a tutor in Amberg. On 23 January he enrolled to the University of Altdorf and started writing his Latin-Hungarian dictionary. He gave the first part of the dictionary to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, and when the book was published he traveled to Prague to show it to the monarch personally. Here he received respectable honor and was welcomed by many people, including Johannes Kepler. The emperor‚Äôs advisers wanted him to convert to the Roman Catholic religion, so they sent him to University of Vienna with 50 Forints reimbursing his traveling expenses. When Stephen Bocskay's War of Independence broke out he returned to the Holy-Roman Empire.D√©zsi 1897; Szenczi 1984: 105; Giebermann 2005: 9.; Petr≈ëczi 2006: 54. In Germany he was patronized by two Protestant monarchs, Elector Palatine Frederick IV and Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. In 1606 in Heidelberg Frederick ordered an alimentation for him at the teachers‚Äô desk, and from 1607 to 1611 was given bed and board by Maurice at his own expense in Marburg. Szenczi wrote his Hungarian grammar (1604) for Maurice who spoke Hungarian and was highly educated, and published it again in 1611 extended with a Greek glossary. His psalm translations also appeared in this period, as well as the Heidelberg Catechism (1607), and the Hanau Bible (1608), which is the revised version of the Vizsoly Bible. On 8 October 1611 he married Kunigunda von Ferinar from Luther‚Äôs family who was the ex-wife of a teacher called Conrad Vietor. They had 2 sons and 4 daughters (1612, John Albert, 1614: Elizabeth, 1617 Mary Magdalene, 1618, Paul, 1620: Elizabeth Kunigunda, 1623: Mary Elizabeth). Probably in 1611‚Äì12 he worked as a proofreader in Oppenheim. In 1612 a week after of his son‚Äôs baptism he left to Hungary, where he attended the synod of K√∂vesk√∫t.D√©zsi 1897; Zov√°nyi 1977; Szenczi 1984: 161‚Äì162; Giebermann 2005: 11‚Äì13.; Petr≈ëczi 2006: 56.; Nagy 2008: 259. For a while he worked as a printing supervisor in his wife‚Äôs birthplace in Oppenheim. Then in 1613 he moved to Hungary with his family, where he worked as a pastor, at first in V√°rosszal√≥nak and then in Rohonc. Since he did not manage to establish a printer‚Äôs workshop there, he made himself invited who appointed him as a professor of the college in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (today: Alba Iulia, Romania), but because of his family he moved back to Germany. According to art historian Samu Benk≈ë it is conceivable that Szenczi performed a diplomatic mission for Gabriel Bethlen: the monarch wanted to get in touch with the Protestant Union that way. Szenczi was appointed as a cantor of the church of Saint Sebastian in October 1615, as well as a teacher of the school, then in 1617 its rector by the son of his old patron Frederick V, Elector Palatine. By his administrative job he continued his work with the Hungarian Calvinistic literature.Benk≈ë 1984: 62; Giebermann 2005: 17‚Äì18.; Nagy 2008: 259‚Äì260. Due to the Thirty Years‚Äô War he lost his home, and moved to the royal court in Heidelberg. The city was ravaged by Count Tilly‚Äôs soldiers after the Battle of White Mountain; Szenczi was also pillaged and tortured, so he decided to migrate to Hanau. Here he published the translated edition of the Institutes of the Christian Religion commissioned by Gabriel Bethlen. After a trip to Netherlands he got an invitation from Bethlen again in 1624, so he finally returned home. Since 1625 he lived in Kassa and since 1629 in Kolozsv√°r (today: Cluj-Napoca, Romania). During his subsequent stay in Hungary he lived in poverty and was later completely forgotten. The new monarch George I R√°k√≥czi did not support him effectively. In January 1634 he died of plague.

He is the founder of The Crucible, a nonprofit industrial arts school in Oakland, California, United States, and served as its Executive Director from 1999 to 2011. Sturtz joined Stanford University's d.school in 2012, where he spearheaded a new artistic genre of live performance as director of the ReDesigning Theater Project. In 2014, Sturtz founded Stanford‚Äôs Creative Ignition Lab at Autodesk in San Francisco. This new lab explored the potential for visual, experiential, and embodied thinking to unlock the future of making and learning. While at Autodesk, Michael joined the Applied Research & Innovation team at Pier 9, where he helped innovate new ways to utilize machine learning within robotic welding. In 2017 and 2018, Michael led the prototyping lab at Google X, where he led his own moonshot investigation and collaborated to pioneer the future of automated manufacturing.  Early life and education  Sturtz grew up tinkering with machines and from a very young age could be found rebuilding cars in his stepfather's auto body shop, where he developed an affinity for metal and machinery. Always fascinated with the elegance and intricacies of how things worked, he would spend hot summer afternoons dissecting road kill and later observe his father, an orthopedic surgeon, in the operating room. As a result, he developed a fascination for the hidden mechanics of everyday forms. Sturtz received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Alfred University School of Art and Design and his Master of Fine Arts from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He also studied stone carving at the studio of Sem Ghelardini, in Pietrasanta, Italy. His work often combines organic themes with metal and machinery. Sturtz states that his artwork \\"showcases a strong juxtaposition between materials including metals and glass, stone and kinetics, fire and liquid, 3D objects and video.\\" His sculptural works are exhibited extensively in collections throughout the US, Italy and England.  The Crucible  The Crucible is a 501(c)(3) non-profit arts education organization that fosters a collaboration of arts, industry, and community. In 1999, Sturtz founded The Crucible, a non-profit regional art center in Oakland, CA, where industrial arts are taught in a creative and non- competitive learning environment. Sturtz's goal was to break down barriers to the arts by creating an art school that emphasized non-competitive learning and participation. During his 12 years as Executive Director, Sturtz nurtured what began as an idea and a $1,750 seed grant into the largest nonprofit industrial arts educational facility in the nation. Sturtz designed The Crucible's facilities and programs, and then led a staff and faculty of 100+ in the build-out of a 56,000 square foot industrial arts facility where over 8,000 students would attend every year. The Crucible welcomes 20,000 visitors per year to participate in adult art education, youth programs, community outreach, corporate workshops, and open house events. The Crucible's Firebird Ballet During his tenure as The Crucible‚Äôs Executive Director, Sturtz developed a reputation for innovative projects. He produced and directed large-scale theatrical events and festivals which melded the classical and industrial arts, in The Crucible‚Äôs Fire Operas, Fire Ballets and Fire Arts Festivals.  Stanford  alt= alt= Sturtz retired from The Crucible on January 15, 2011 to join Stanford University, accepting a teaching appointment in the Mechanical Engineering Design Group. He went on to teach at The Stanford School of Design, where he spearheaded and then directed the ReDesigning Theater Project, a creative program focusing on cutting edge live performance appealing to the 21 to 35-year-old demographic. In 2014, Sturtz became the Executive Director of The Stanford Creative Ignition Lab @ Autodesk. The lab explored the potential for visual, experiential, and embodied thinking to advance the future of learning, design, and making. The program's aim was to pioneer new ways to more purposefully bring the tools of invention and production seamlessly into creative processes. alt= Sturtz participated in TEDx Stanford's ‚ÄúAbove and Beyond‚Äú series, to speak about finding your creative voice and harnessing your creativity.  World land speed record for biodiesel motorcycle  On September 3, 2007 Michael rode Die Moto at the Bonneville Salt Flats, breaking the world land speed record using 100% biodiesel. Die Moto is the world‚Äôs first biodiesel land speed motorcycle. It was built in 2006 by Sturtz and The Diesel Dozen, a team of artists, builders, engineers and gearheads who shared the common goal of constructing a biodiesel bike that could beat the existing diesel motorcycle world land speed record of 105 mph. Die Moto combines a BWM chassis with a car engine and a hand-tooled retro fairing. Sturtz and the team worked for nearly one year, overcoming engineering challenges and garnering sponsorships and media interest. On September 3, 2007 Sturtz piloted the custom-built biodiesel motorcycle Die-Moto at the Bonneville Salt Flats, setting the world land speed record at 130.614 MPH, using 100% biodiesel. The event was the first non-petroleum powered motorcycle to ever run at Bonneville, and set the world record running on Greenline Industries B100 biodiesel fuel. The world land speed record remains unbroken.  International speaker and consultant  Sturtz is an international speaker and consultant specializing in innovative thought leadership, organizational development, and creative empowerment. He is currently pioneering the concept of \\"indigeny\\", a state of life that seeks healthy harmony and balance with the human body and Earth‚Äôs natural systems. Indigeny draws inspiration and guidance from indigenous cultures, while harnessing innovative environmental technology to build a new model of living on the planet that would make our existing model obsolete.

Members  The GBGA is funded by its members, and the majority of remote gambling licence holders holding licences issued by the Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner are members. Members include household names in the gambling industry such as Bet365, Betfair, Ladbrokes and William Hill.  Purpose  The GBGA's purpose is to speak on behalf of the Gibraltar remote gambling licensees on matters of legal and regulatory importance to the gambling industry, when engaging in dialogue with relevant authorities around the world. It also aims to provide governments, legislators and policy makers with a better understanding of the gambling industry and its importance to Gibraltar. The GBGA has operated since January 2005, however in April 2013 it was incorporated into corporate form. Peter Howitt, was appointed Chief Executive of the GBGA in May 2013. Peter is the founder of Ramparts, a law firm in Gibraltar. The GBGA also receives consultancy advice from Sir Peter Caruana, the ex Chief Minister of Gibraltar.  Activity  The GBGA stated in 2013 that it may seek a judicial review of what became the Gambling (Licensing & Advertising) Act 2014 on the basis that it breaches EU law. The Act includes the introduction of a UK licensing regime and a tax on gambling of 15% in the UK (point of consumption tax). The changes to tax legislation are anticipated to raise over ¬£300 million in UK tax revenues. Peter Howitt attended a session at UK Parliament to give oral evidence regarding the proposal, heard by MPs including Helen Grant the Minister for the Department for Culture Media and Sport. In November 2013 the GBGA set out its proposals for an alternative passporting regime whereby gambling companies holding remote gambling licences from reputable jurisdictions could rely on their existing licence to operate in the UK without having to obtain a separate UK Gambling Commission Licence. The proposals can be found at UK Parliament Publications On 18 June 2014 the GBGA wrote to both the UK Government and UK Gambling Commission putting them on notice of a claim for judicial review of the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014 on the basis that the Act is 'unlawful' and 'unworkable'. The GBGA has an affiliate partnership with the European Betting and Gaming Association (EGBA), and is the first national member of the EGBA. This partnership is intended to enable both associations to more effectively consult at EU level on matters of importance to the gambling industry, such as anti-money laundering legislation.

Much of the area consists of easy and intermediate skiing, but the area around the Passo dei Salati and especially the steep slopes in Alagna Valsesia are a major and very famous destination for freeride skiers and snow-boarders.  Description  The area takes its name from the huge and spectacular Monte Rosa massif as the heads of its three constituent valleys are located within this group. These valleys are the Val d'Ayas and the Lys Valley, located within the Aosta Valley, and Alagna Valsesia in the Valsesia Valley, in Piedmont . The connections between the valleys are at the Bettaforca Pass (Ayas and Lys), and the Passo dei Salati (Lys and Valsesia). These connections are susceptible to closure in the case of high winds. Since 2010, most of the lift system open in summer for mountain bikers and hikers. You can reach Frachey (Ayas), then Alagna Valsesia and back within the same day using only the lifts.  Ski Pistes and Lifts There are approximately 180 km of ski slopes (almost all equipped with snow-making), from the most simple to the more technical (19 blue runs, 41 red runs and 6 black runs, including, in Gressoney-Saint-Jean, the most difficult of the whole Aosta Valley), and 38 lifts that start at a minimum altitude of 1212 m above sea level Alagna Valsesia and reach up to 3275 m s.l.m. at Indren Peak. The overall uplift capacity of the lift system is about 50,000 people per hour. The Alagna Valsesia part of the district is world-famous for its many off-piste skiing and ski mountaineering like Balma and Malfatta. The ski area is operated jointly by two companies: Monterosa S.p.A. and MONTEROSA 2000 S.p.A. (of Alagna). They operatate a diverse range of ski lifts: funicular, funifor (Funifor Pianalunga - Passo dei Salati), cable car, ski lift, treadmill and chairlift (two-seater, three-seater, fixed- grip quad chairlift or automatic) are the different types of plants lifts that make up the district.  Constituent Resorts  The individual villages and hamlets that are resorts within the ski area are : * Ayas - Antagnod * Ayas - Champoluc * Brusson * Gressoney-La-Trinit√© * Gressoney-Saint-Jean * Alagna Valsesia Of these only Champoluc, Gressoney-La-Trinit√© and Alagna are directly connected by ski lifts and routes. This interconnected area forms the largest part of the available skiing. The Alpe di Mera was part of the Monterosa Ski for the seasons 2007-2008 and 2008-2009.

Life Morison was born at Anchorfield, near Edinburgh, and was educated at Edinburgh High School and the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. on 12 September 1799. He became a licentiate of the Edinburgh College of Physicians in 1800 and a Fellow in 1801. He would serve as President of the College from 1827 to 1829. For a time, Morison practised in Edinburgh, but during 1808 he moved to London; on 11 April that year he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, and 10 July 1841 he was elected a Fellow. He was appointed inspecting physician of lunatic asylums in Surrey in 1810, and from 7 May 1835 physician to Bethlehem Hospital. He was physician to Charlotte, Princess Royal, and was knighted in 1838. Morison gave an annual course of lectures on mental diseases ‚Äì commemorated in the Morisonian Lectures of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh ‚Äì and became a recognised authority on this subject. A lifelong restlessness seems to have haunted Morison's career ‚Äì as a child he repeatedly ran away from school in Edinburgh (on one occasion as far as to the harbour in Arbroath) ‚Äì and, as an adult, he (like Lord Monboddo) excited astonishment with his regular, exhausting rides between London and Edinburgh, lecturing in both cities. A remarkable portrait of Morison - of almost hallucinatory intensity - was created by the psychotic Victorian artist Richard Dadd in 1852, and it incorporated images of Anchorfield created by Morison's daughter. This picture now hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Morison died at home, Balerno Hill House,Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory (Balerno) 1863-4 south-west of Edinburgh on 14 March 1866, and was buried at Currie. His grave stands in the eastern wall in the north- east corner of the original churchyard. His death was marked by an extraordinary tribute from William A.F. Browne, the President of the Medico- Psychological Association, in the course of his 1866 Presidential Address in which he linked Morison's achievements with those of John Conolly, who had died only a few days earlier. Works Morison's graduation thesis was De Hydrocephalo Phrenitico, and he became specialist in cerebral diseases and mental illness. He published in 1826 Outlines of Lectures on Mental Diseases, and in 1828 Cases of Mental Disease, with Practical Observations on the Medical Treatment. In 1840 he published The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases, an important contribution to the literature of physiognomy. It features some remarkable illustrations, including a portrait of Jonathan Martin the arsonist.  Alexander Morison Medal  Morison endowed lectures through the sale of his property starting in 1864 on subjects connected with the mental disease; later extended to cover diseases connected with the nervous system.

The implicit concept is that a specific culture can have a philosophy that is not applicable and accessible to all peoples and cultures in the world; however, this concept is disputed by traditional philosophers. Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998), pp. 38-39, An example of ethnophilosophy is African philosophy. The term ethno-philosophy was first used by Kwame Nkrumah and was coined by Paulin J. Hountondji who viewed it as a combination of ethnography and philosophy. Ethno-philosophy is based on the works of ethnographers, sociologists and anthropologists who interpret collective world views of African people's, their myths and folklores as a constitutive part of African philosophy. Ethno-philosophy is a study of ethnic Africans and their way of life. It has long been argued that Africans lack lacked culture and history and are illiterates, in the sense that the Africans were exposed to education by the missionaries (Basel, Wesleyan or Catholic) and colonial settlers. The study of ethno-philosophy aids Africans to know that they are rational thinkers and are not inferior as such arguments made by Westerners are false.

Vol. IV, 2014, No. 1. . pp. 22-23 The religion is based on Confucian moral ideas and ancestral worship, and includes meditation techniques modeled after neidan and pursuit of enlightenment.Edward L. Davis. Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture. ¬∂ Sanyi jiao Differently from other Chinese folk religious sects, the Sanyi philosophy is not expounded in the sentimental vernacular language but in the elaborate language of the Confucian literary tradition. The \\"Three in One\\" is a philosophical concept expressing the original trinity proceeding from the Tao, the two principles, yin and yang, of the Great Pole.Dean, 1998. pp. 36-37 The Great Pole is the One that contains yin and yang, the Two, in the Three. History Sanyiism was founded by Lin Zhao'en (1517‚Äì98), in Putian, Fujian. Lin was born in an upper-class family, and among his ancestors and relatives were many officials and scholars. He started the usual career for the son of an influential family and passed the first civil examinations in 1534, but after failing the higher exams he forsook the career of an official to become a master of religion and philosophy according to the Confucian tradition.Seiwert, 2003. p. 350 Given this background, Lin Zhao'en doctrines show little influence from the vernacular folk religious tradition of the baojuan literature. Lin Zhao'en was instructed by other religious leaders, including a Confucian who taught him the true meaning of the Confucian classics and Taoists from whom he learnt neidan techniques.Seiwert, 2003. pp. 346-347 In 1585 the regional official Yang Sizhi wrote a proclamation of heterodoxy against Lin, upset by his claim to be the true interpreter of the Confucian tradition, rejecting Zhu Xi, and to continue the teachings of the sages of antiquity.Seiwert, 2003. pp. 350-351 Despite the accusation of heterodoxy, the strength of the sect remained unshaken.Seiwert, 2003. pp. 352-353 In Sanyi holy scriptures Lin Zhao'en is portrayed as a supernatural savior of cosmic significance.Seiwert, 2003. p. 356 After Lin died, he was deified as the \\"Lord of the Three-in-One\\", and is worshipped in over a thousand temples in Fujian, and also in Taiwan and Southeast Asia's Chinese communities. The religious community split into a number of schools and spread beyond the borders of Fujian up to Anhui, and then reaching Beijing. The community in Nanjing developed as an influential centre of gravitation for the religion.Seiwert, 2003. pp. 353-354 In Fujian, the religion developed into two major competing branches led by two direct disciples of Master Lin, namely Lu Wenhui and Lin Zhenming (alias Lin Zhijing). Through the Qing dynasty the religion survived strong in Fujian but declined elsewhere, and at the end of the 19th century it started to strongly revive. As of 1998 the Church of the Three-in-One had approximately 500,000 adherents in Putian, which is 17% of the total population.Dean, 1998. p. 7 In 2011 it was officially recognised as a legal religion by the government of Fujian. Rituals Three-in-One practices include the \\"heart method\\" of self-cultivation, which is still widely practised in Putian today. The religion has its independent ritual tradition, similar to those of Taoism and Buddhism. Its ritual specialists perform communal offerings (jiao) and funeral services (gongde), along with individual rites.

Life Born at Halesworth in Suffolk on 16 February 1772, he was the only son of John Tuthill, an attorney there, by his wife Sarah, only daughter of James Jermyn of the same town. He received his education at Bungay under Mr. Reeve, and on 3 June 1790 was admitted sizar at Caius College, Cambridge. He was scholar of the college from Michaelmas 1790 to Michaelmas 1796. He graduated B.A. in 1794, and was subsequently elected to present a university address to the king. Visiting Paris with his wife, Tuthill was one of the British subjects detained by the French government because of the French Revolutionary Wars. After several years they were released when his wife appealed to the first consul. Tuthill then returned to Cambridge, proceeded M.A. in 1809, had a licence ad practicandum from the university dated 25 November 1812, and graduated M.D. in 1816. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1810, and was admitted an inceptor candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 12 April 1813, a candidate on 30 September 1816, and a fellow on 30 September 1817. Tuthill was Gulstonian lecturer in 1818, and censor in 1819 and 1830. He was knighted on 28 April 1820. He was physician to the Westminster Hospital and Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, posts he held for the rest of his life. He was nominated to give the Harveian oration on 25 June 1835, but died first; that year, with Sir Henry Halford and William George Maton, he helped reform the Royal College of Physicians. Tuthill purchased Cransford Hall of Cransford, Suffolk in 1832, upon his death the hall passed to his daughter Laurie Maria. Tuthill died at his house in Cavendish Square, London on 7 April 1835, and was buried at St. Albans on the 14th of the same month. His library was sold by Sotheby's on 26 and 27 June 1835. Works Tuthill was a member of the committee for the preparation of the Pharmacop≈ìia Londinensis of 1824, and was responsible for the language of the work itself. He published an English version at the same time as the Latin original. He was also engaged on the Pharmacop≈ìia of 1836, but died before it appeared. He wrote also Vindici√¶ Medic√¶, or a Defence of the College of Physicians, 1834. Family Shortly after graduating, Tuthill married Maria, daughter of Richard Smith of Halesworth. There was a monument to his and his wife's memory at Cransford in Suffolk. He left an only daughter, Laura Maria, married to Thomas Bowett, a solicitor in London.

They are found predominantly in the temperate and colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly East Asia and North America. The subfamily includes two tribes. They are of economic importance, particularly the lilies and tulips.  Description  Lilliodeae genera are relatively homogeneous and distinct from the other two Liliaceae subfamilies (Calochortoideae and Streptopoideae). They are perennial herbaceous flowering plants that are mainly bulbous (Lilieae) with contractile roots, but may be rhizomatous (Medeoleae). Stems unbranched, leaves with parallel venation. Flowers are large and showy. The embryo sac (megagametophyte) is of the Fritillaria-type (tetrasporic). Capsule septicidal, seeds often flattened, exotesta palisaded or lignified. The seeds of Medeoleae are striate. Chromosome number may be 7 (Medeoleae), 9, or 11‚Äì14, with a highly variable length (2.2 - 27 ¬µm).  Taxonomy  The term was introduced by Amos Eaton in his Botanical Dictionary in 1836. Engler and Prantl included it as one of the eleven subfamilies of Liliaceae. In 1927, Buxbaum's treatment of the subfamily included three tribes; Lloydieae (Gagea, Lloydia and Szechenya and Giradiella ‚Äî both now included in Lloydia), Tulipeae: (Erythronium, Tulipa and Eduardoregalia ‚Äî now part of Tulipa) and Lilieae (Korolkowia, Fritillaria, Notholirion, Cardiocrinum, Nomocharis and Lilium). In the phylogenetic era, the subfamily Lilioideae has been circumscribed in both a broad (sensu lato, or s.l.) and narrow (sensu stricto, or s.s.) sense. Tamura, and others have defined Lilioideae s.s. (or sensu Tamura) to include only the tribes Tulipeae and Lilieae. However other authorities including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APWeb) define Lilioideae s.l. to also include the Medeoleae (while subsuming the Tulipae into Lilieae). In the s.s. usage, the Medeoleae are treated as a separate subfamily, the Medeoloideae. = Genera = The subfamily Lilioideae includes ten genera and about 535 species. The largest genera are Gagea (200), Fritillaria (130), Lilium (110), and Tulipa (75 species).  References  Bibliography   Tropicos: Lilioideae Eaton  * In .

Life He was born into the family of Francisko Filip, a weaver in P≈ôibyslav who already had four other children: Jan's brothers Venceslao and Francisko and sisters Karla and Maria. After four years, another brother, Karlo, was born. Jan Filip spent his childhood in P≈ôibyslav, where he attended primary school. He was accepted to a high school in Prague, which he finished with an abitur, on which he received an excellent score, in 1931. In Hradec Kr√°lov√©, he studied at a theological seminary for pastors, and in 1936 he became a priest. He celebrated the solemn first fruit mass in his hometown P≈ôibyslav. He began as a chaplain in Jiƒç√≠n. After a year, he was an administrator in the parish of Nov√° Ves nad Popelkou. For a year, he was a chaplain in Kutn√° Hora and finally, he taught religion, history, and Latin at a high school and a school for teachers for six years, also in Kutn√° Hora. He taught for one year at a high school in Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√©, for another year at a high school in Jiƒç√≠n, and for three more years at a high school in N√°chod. In the year 1950, after the beginning of a strong political leaning towards communism, he was prohibited from teaching and only allowed to provide pastoral care. He provided pastoral care for five years in his hometown P≈ôibyslav, for four months in Veli≈°, for four years in Chleny, for four years in Letohrad, and for nine years in Kratonohy, near Hradec Kr√°lov√©, where he died. His grave in P≈ôibyslav has a statue of the Virgin Mary ‚Äì a personal donation from Belgian Esperantists. Esperanto Filip, a talented nine-year-old, learned Esperanto in 1921. In 1925, at age 13, he began to write an extensive Esperanto-Czech dictionary, because at the time nothing of the kind had ever been published. After three years he finished the compilation of the dictionary, with the help of his brother Karel Filip, and despite the fact that two more years passed before it was published in 1930, he became the youngest lexicographer in the world. A second edition appeared in 1947, and a reprinting in 1987. His Esperanto-Czech and Czech-Esperanto dictionaries, also written with his brother Karel, appeared in Prague in 1958 with 550 and 450 pages. His translation of a collection of Czech folksongs into Esperanto was published twice. During his years of high school in Prague, the international association of Esperantists announced a competition for the most beautiful poem about the Virgin Mary in Esperanto. The first prize in the contest was deliberately only symbolic, but beautiful: a bouquet of white roses, which the winner was to place at the feet of the statue of the Virgin Mary in Lourdes. Jan Filip, then only a young student from Prague, won the first prize. Despite the fact that he himself did not visit Lourdes, because his school did not allow him to, representatives from the Klubo de Katolikaj Esperantistoj placed his bouquet of white roses at the feet of the Virgin Mary in Lourdes. The name of the Czech Esperantist Jan Filip was soon known throughout the Esperanto community. In the year 1968, the Swiss Esperantist and translator Madlen Welsh visited him in Kratonohy, so that she could personally meet this eminent Esperantist who had written extensive dictionaries and many books in Esperanto. At that time, his plays were being performed in Switzerland: La Turo Inter Nuboj (\\"The Tower Between Clouds\\") and Fino de la Mondo (\\"End of the World\\"). In 1970, he translated many religious songs for young Catholic Esperantists, which were sung in tent camps in Herbortice. Later, he visited many foreign countries, where his lectures in Esperanto about the Czech Republic captured the attention of his audiences. He even received special thanks from Czech state officials for lectures in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. In addition to Esperanto, he was fluent in several foreign languages, into which he translated his poems, stories, and plays. Additionally, he learned the basics of many other languages for his studies. His poems appeared for decades in various Esperanto gazettes. He wrote several brochures, led correspondence courses, and wrote 14 plays in Czech.

The ride, built by Mack Rides, features two linear synchronous motor launches and has a top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph). It features a dual-launch helix. The ride opened on 26 April 2014, Liseberg's opening date for the 2014 season. Helix is the first roller coaster in the world that has a 1-on-1 replica virtual reality experience. This experience is created by ArchiVision, a Dutch 3D studio. During the first two weeks after the premiere visitors could experience the virtual reality replica next to the roller coaster's entrance. The roller coaster's station building is located where the 3D cinema Maxxima used to be, by the foot of the tower AtmosFear. The track follows the hillside in a custom-made track design. The elements during the ride include two corkscrews, a pretzel knot, a top hat, a zero-g roll, and a rare Norwegian loop. The estimated cost for the project is about 239,000,000 Swedish kronor.

West Kent (or West of Kent) teams have been recorded from 1705 but there is no known record of an East Kent team until 1781. There were seven major matches from 1781 to 1790 in which teams of this type faced each other, although there is doubt about the match titles with sources using different team names. The first Kent Cricket Club was founded in Canterbury on 6 August 1842, formed out of the Beverley Cricket Club, and played its first match against All-England three weeks later. In 1859 a second county club was formed at Maidstone to support the Canterbury club, the two often being known as the East Kent and West Kent clubs respectively.Marsham G (1907) A short history of Kent cricket, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1907.

The two clubs amalgamated in 1870 to form the modern day Kent County Cricket Club.A brief history of Kent, CricInfo. Retrieved 2016-02-14. Teams called East Kent and West Kent played each other twice in 1856 in minor matches. Those two matches are the last known to involve an East Kent team. West Kent became the name of a 19th-century club which played minor cricket only and was for a long time based at Chislehurst Cricket Club, with which it ultimately amalgamated in 1980 as the Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club. Matches The earliest known record of a \\"West Kent\\" or \\"West of Kent\\" team is in a match against Chatham Cricket Club on 7 August 1705, played at a place called \\"Maulden\\" in the primary source. There is no such place although it is generally believed to refer to Town Malling near Maidstone.Town Malling Cricket Club [TownMallingCC] The Old County Ground in @west_malling #westmalling 191yrs of cricketing history in The Garden Of England @VisitKent @westmallingCEP @west_mallingpc #KentDay, (Tweet), via Twitter, 2018-05-26.

The next mention is a match on 22 September 1769, played at Sevenoaks Vine between West Kent and a Surrey team. The original report merely states that the wickets will be \\"pitched soon after 10\\".Buckley, p. 52. The earliest known match involving an \\"East Kent\\" team is one played against West Kent at Sevenoaks Vine on 20 and 21 June 1781. The question of nomenclature arises here because, with at least three \\"given men\\" (i.e., borrowed players), on each side the match is also called Duke of Dorset's XI versus Sir Horatio Mann's XI after the two team patrons John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann. The \\"East Kent\\" team, Mann's XI, included John Small, Richard Aubrey Veck and Lamborn of Hambledon and Hampshire. The \\"West Kent\\" team, Dorset's XI, featured the Hambledon players Noah Mann and Tom Sueter with the Chertsey and Surrey players William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens. Noted Kent players involved in the match include Joseph Miller, William Bullen, William Bowra, Robert Clifford and Thomas Pattenden.Haygarth, pp. 47‚Äì48. Sevenoaks Vine was Dorset's home ground and there was a return match at Bourne Paddock at Mann's Bourne Park House near Bishopsbourne from 8 to 11 August. This also featured guest players with Surrey's William Yalden and Hampshire's James Aylward joining Small, Lamborn, Sueter, Bedster, Mann and Stevens.Haygarth, pp. 49‚Äì50. Dorset's West Kent XI won both matches, the first by 10 wickets and the return by 106 runs. Part of the confusion around match titles comes from the ways in which Arthur Haygarth records matches. He calls the June match \\"West Kent with Mann, Sueter & Lumpy versus East Kent with Small, Veck & Lamborn\\", but then calls the August match \\"Sir Horace Mann's Side versus the Duke of Dorset's Side\\". In its \\"Important Cricket Matches\\" guide, the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians follows Haygarth by using the abbreviated titles \\"East Kent with 3 gm v West Kent with 3 gm\\" for the June match and \\"Duke of Dorset v Sir H. Mann\\" for the August match (\\"gm\\" meaning \\"given men\\").ACS, p. 25. On 25 and 26 June 1783, a match at Sevenoaks Vine involved \\"West Kent with Harris, Stevens and Bedster versus East Kent\\". East Kent won this by 2 wickets. A curious condition of the match was that Lumpy Stevens, generally reckoned the outstanding bowler of the time, \\"was not to bowl, by agreement\\". This would have severely handicapped his team, which lost the match, as he was not a good batsman and so, as Haygarth says, \\"not much use as a given man\\". Stephen Amherst, who was a Maidstone man and the patron of later West Kent teams, played in this match for the East.Haygarth, pp. 56‚Äì57. Amherst had become a match organiser by the start of the 1789 season and led his team to a five-wicket victory against that of Mann at Coxheath on 22 and 23 May. A contemporary report in the Maidstone Journal describes the game as \\"Sir H. Mann with a select eleven of the County against S. Amherst, Esq. and the County at large, for 100 guineas\\".Buckley, p. 135. The ACS calls the match \\"Sir H. Mann v S. Amherst\\".ACS, p. 27. However, the next Mann-Amherst match on 29 and 30 June, also at Coxheath, is called \\"East Kent v West Kent with each side having 4 gm\\". This follows Haygarth, whose title is \\"East Kent with Boorman and Four of Hampshire versus West Kent with Four of Surrey\\". East Kent won by 8 runs and Haygarth confirms Mann and Amherst as respective managers. The guest players in this match were John Boorman, Richard Purchase, John Small, David Harris and Tom Taylor for the East and Billy Beldham, Harry Walker, Tom Walker and John Wells for the West. Apart from a couple of changes in the East Kent lineup, the same teams met again at Coxheath on 4 and 5 August, East Kent winning by 57 runs.Haygarth, p. 96. The final match between Amherst's West and Mann's East took place at Bishopsbourne from 7 to 11 September 1790. Haygarth called it \\"East Kent with Purchase versus West Kent\\". West Kent won by 130 runs.Haygarth, pp. 108‚Äì109. Sir Horatio Mann became MP for Sandwich in 1790 and reduced his involvement in cricket. The match in September 1790 is the last East Kent v. West Kent match that can be considered a major fixture.

Other names for bismuth oxynitrate include bismuth subnitrate and bismuthyl nitrate. In older texts bismuth oxynitrate is often simply described as BiONO3. Bismuth oxynitrate was once called magisterium bismuti or bismutum subnitricum, and was used as a white pigment, in beauty care, and as a gentle disinfectant for internal and external use. Bismuth oxynitrate is commercially available as Bi5O(OH)9(NO3)4 (CAS number: 1304-85-4) or as BiONO3¬∑H2O (CAS Number 13595-83-0). Some compounds have been fully characterised with single crystal studies and found to contain the octahedral [Bi6Ox(OH)8‚àíx](10-x)+ cation. There is indirect evidence that either the octahedral cation Bi6O4(OH)46+ or the octahedral cation Bi6(OH)126+ is present in aqueous solution following the polymerisation of Bi(H2O)83+, the Bi3+ ion present in acidic solutions. The ion Bi6O4(OH)46+ is found in the perchlorate compound Bi6O4(OH)4ClO4¬∑7H2O and is isoelectronic with the octahedral Sn6O4(OH)4 cluster found in the hydrate of tin(II) oxide, 3SnO¬∑H2O. The compounds that contain this are:- :Bi6O4(HO)4(NO3)6¬∑H2O (equivalent to BiONO3¬∑0.5 H2O; Bi2O3.N2O5.H2O ) :Bi6O4(OH)4(NO3)6.4H2OLazarini, F. \\"Tetra-Œº 3-hydroxo-tetra-Œº 3-oxo-hexabismuth (III) nitrate tetrahydrate,[Bi 6 O 4 (OH) 4](NO 3) 6‚Ä¢ 4H 2 O.\\" Cryst.

Additionally some oxynitrates have layer structures (a common motif also found in bismuth(III) oxyhalides):- :Bi2O2(OH)NO3 (equivalent to BiONO3¬∑0.5 H2O) contains \\"[Bi2O2]2+ layersHenry, Natacha, et al. \\"[Bi2O2] 2+ layers in Bi2O2 (OH)(NO3): synthesis and structure determination.\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr Naturforschung.

There is no covalent bond between the Bi atoms, they are held in position by bridging O2‚àí and OH‚àí anions, one at the centre of each of the eight triangular faces, bridging three Bi ions. The Bi ions are essentially four coordinate and are at the apex of a flat square pyramid. An ab initio theoretical study of the hydration mechanism of Bi3+ and the structure concludes that the lone pairs on the Bi3+ ions are stereochemically active.  Preparation of bismuth oxynitrates  Bismuth oxynitrates can be prepared from bismuth(III) nitrate. For example, hydrolysis of a solution of bismuth nitrate through the addition of alkali or the reaction of the pentahydrate, BiNO3¬∑5H2O with KOH, or the controlled thermal decomposition of the pentahydrate. The thermal decomposition of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate proceeds through the following stages :At < pH 1, Bi6O4(OH)4(NO3)6.4H2O (BiNO3.H2O)is the first solid product, which when heated produced Bi6H2O(NO3)O4(OH)4 (BiNO3. 0.5H2O. :Between pH 1.2 and pH 1.8, further hydrolysis occurs and Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5.3H2O is formed. The final oxynitrate product of thermal dehydration is believed to be Bi5O7NO3, which is isostructural with Œ≤‚ÄìBi5O7I and has a layer structure.Ziegler, P., M. Str√∂bele, and H-J. Meyer. \\"Crystal structure of pentabismuth heptaoxide nitrate, Bi5O7NO3.\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr Kristallographie.

The film entered the competition at the 52nd Venice International Film Festival, in which Giordana won the President of the Italian Senate's gold medal. The film also won the David di Donatello for best editing.  Plot  The film traces the last hours of the life of poet and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini. The poet is killed at night in 1975 on the beach at Ostia, near Rome. A boy is arrested: Pino Pelosi, and charged with murder. The police and judges believe that Pelosi is the only murderer of Pasolini, but his injuries on the body of the poet are too severe and profound. Then are called to bear witness to the death of the poet his sister and his mother, destroyed by grief. As the process unfolds, the film examines the personality of Pasolini, and his works and, above all explains what people think of him in Italy. Pasolini according to some Italians was a provocative man: he deserved what he suffered, having been a Communist and a homosexual. Instead, his friends and intellectuals remember him as a very good and sensible man, who sought only to fight against neo- fascism and the cruel and bigoted mentality of middle-class society.

He published on natural history and antiquarian topics. Life The son of George Maton, a wine merchant, was born at Salisbury, 31 January 1774. He attended Salisbury grammar school, and in July 1790 entered The Queen's College, Oxford. While there he became interested in botany, and encountered John Sibthorp. On 18 March 1794 Maton was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society, came to know Sir James Edward Smith the botanist. He became vice-president of the society; and the members showed their regard for him by calling a woodpecker, a shell-fish, and a genus of plants after him. In that year he graduated B.A. at Oxford, and in 1797 M.A. Maton began medical study at Westminster Hospital, and 11 July 1798 graduated M.B. at Oxford, and 15 April 1801 M.D. He was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians of London 30 September 1802, became Gulstonian lecturer in 1803, censor 1804, 1813, and 1824, treasurer 1814 to 1820, and Harveian orator 1815. He was physician to the Westminster Hospital 1800‚Äì8. During the Weymouth \\"season\\" Maton used to practise there. One day as he was walking an equerry summoned him to Queen Charlotte. She asked him to name a specimen (of Calamagrostis epigejos, as he knew) which one of the princesses fond of botany had obtained. In this way he had an introduction to the royal family. In 1816 he was appointed physician extraordinary to Queen Charlotte, and in 1820 attended the Duke of Kent in his last illness. He afterwards became physician to the Duchess of Kent, and to the infant Princess Victoria. Maton's practice increased, and was only exceeded by that of Sir Henry Halford. His father, who had died in 1816, was then deeply in debt, and by 1827 Maton had paid all that was owing. He bought a country seat near Downton, Wiltshire, but six months later became very ill, and died 30 March 1835 at his house in Spring Gardens, London. Works In 1797 Maton published at Salisbury, in two volumes, Observations relative chiefly to the Natural History, Picturesque Scenery, and Antiquities of the Western Counties of England, made chiefly in the Years 1794 and 1796. The initial tour was made with his friend Charles Hatchett and Thomas Rackett the botanist. This is a record of travels in Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset. Maton published papers in the Transactions of the Linnean Society.One in vol. iii. on a freshwater shell, Tellina rivalis; another in vol. v., ‚ÄòObservations on the Orcheston Long Grass;‚Äô a third (vol. vii.), with Rackett, ‚ÄòAn Historical Account of Testaceological Writers,‚Äô and ‚ÄòA Descriptive Catalogue of British Testacea;‚Äô a fifth (vol. x.), ‚ÄòOn Testacea from Rio de la Plata.‚Äô In the London Medical Journal, vol. v., he published a paper on cinchona, in which he describes his discovery of the alkaline principle of the bark. He published on history: he wrote an account of a conventual seal found at Salisbury in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1792, and parts of the Salisbury Guide, and John Hutchins's History of Dorset, as well as a paper on Stonehenge in Arch√¶ologia for 1794.

Meteorological history The low pressure system was named Anne by the Free University of Berlin on 1 January. Some media referred to Anne as the \\"Moon Storm\\". =Storm surge= Significant wave height North Atlantic 3 January 2014 The Anne storm was deepened by the powerful jet stream, one of a series of lows which deepened below 950hPa (for every 1hPa drop in atmospheric pressure, sea level goes up by 1 cm) which is capable of adding over half a meter to sea levels. The storm coincided with high spring tides, and high discharge levels in rivers and estuaries. The long fetch of winds over the western Atlantic pushed water against the coasts, and helped to develop some significant wave heights, especially where the coastal morphology acts to funnel the waves. Forecast Protecting electrical equipment in Belfast ahead of the storm Meteo France issued an orange alert in Brittany for the departments of Morbihan and Ille-et-Vilaine, the warning level was raised to red for the department of Finist√®re. The Jersey Met Office gave out a red alert, its highest level of warning. In the UK the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, after chairing a Cobra meeting on 2 January, said the country was facing \\"exceptional weather\\". Cork City Council warned of coastal flood threat in low-lying areas of the city. The Isle of Man Government issued a red warning (the highest) for Friday 3 January, advising that water levels were expected to be 800mm above harbour walls. Water heights were expected to be higher than a surge event in 2002, which caused 8 million pounds of damage on the island. Islanders were warned of the danger posed by contaminated water and open manhole covers; and vulnerable roads around the island were closed. Natural Resources Wales advised that it was expecting the highest tide to hit the entire Welsh coast since 1997.

Cooper was born in Tralee, County Kerry, Ireland and in his short career to date has scored notable wins at the National Hunt Cheltenham Festival. Background and early life Coming from a horsey family it was virtually inevitable that Cooper would be involved in that industry. Around the time he was born his parents won a pony in a raffle and this was named Snowy by the family. At an early age Cooper jumped up on Snowy's back and rode him around his fathers yard. He then progressed to the pony and show jumping circuit and retained an interest in these events until he was around 15 years old. Cooper took part in his first race when he was just 14, learning his trade in his father's yard and spending his school holidays in the yard of Dessie Hughes. Knowing that a life in the horse industry was for him; Cooper left school before completing his final exams and took up a post in the yard of Kevin Prendergast which led to his first racecourse ride in The Curragh on 14 September 2008. Riding career At 15 Cooper weighed 8 stone 4 pound, but a growth spurt during this period put paid to his chances of riding on the flat. He returned to Dessie Hughes yard so that he could take up riding National Hunt horses which was always his first love. Memorably for Cooper his first win was aboard Rossdara, a horse trained by his father, in a maiden hurdle race at Clonmel on 29 October 2009. A few weeks later Cooper rode his first winner for Dessie Hughes at Punchestown and in the next season 2010/11 he fulfilled his promise by winning the conditional championship and winning his first Listed race by piloting Coscorrig to victory in the John Fowler Mares Chase. His winning margin was 14 better than his nearest rival and he also managed to win at the renowned Galway Races that begin on the last Monday in July. The teenage Cooper had another exceptional season in 2011/12 finishing the season with 36 wins and also scoring his first Grade 1 victory aboard Benefficent for Tony Martin in the Deloitte Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown in February. He also won two Grade 2 races for Dessie Hughes at Thurles and Limerick and managed to ride a few placed horses at the Cheltenham Festival meet. The world really took notice of Cooper in the 2012/13 season after 3 wins at the Cheltenham Festival Meeting. His wins came on rides aboard Benefficient, Our Conor in the Triumph Hurdle and Ted Veale and his total number of wins was only one behind that of Ruby Walsh. He managed to place 4th in the Grand National at Aintree but his season was cut short after he broke his femur while riding at Down Royal. It was announced on 3 January 2014 that Cooper is to take over the position of retained jockey for Gigginstown House Stud from the 2012/13 Irish Champion Jockey Davy Russell. Cooper had his first winner for the stud riding Toner D‚ÄôOudairies at the Listed Thurles Racecourse Supporters Club Chase on 6 January 2014. On the second day of the 2014 Cheltenham Festival, Cooper sustained fractures to his tibia and fibula in a fall at the last in the Fred Winter Juvenile Novices' Handicap Hurdle. At the 2016 Cheltenham Festival Meeting Cooper won the Cheltenham Gold Cup riding Don Cossack; this race is the Blue Riband of National Hunt Racing. On the 28th of July Gigginstown Stud manager Eddie O'Leary announced that Cooper would no longer be retained by Gigginstown but would continue to ride for Gigginstown a lot.
