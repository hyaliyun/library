Father Sebastian is wearing the white habit of Capuchin Franciscan missionaries. Father Sebastian Englert OFM Cap., (November 17, 1888 – January 8, 1969) was a Capuchin Franciscan friar, Roman Catholic priest, missionary, linguist and ethnologist from Germany. He is known for his pioneering work on Easter Island, where the Father Sebastian Englert Anthropological Museum is named after him. Early life in Bavaria Born Anton Franz Englert in Dillingen, Bavaria, Father Sebastian spent his school days in Eichstätt and Burghausen. In 1907, he entered the novitiate of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin and received the religious name Sebastian. He undertook his canonical studies in philosophy and theology in the Capuchin studium of Dillingen, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1912. During the First World War, Father Sebastian served as a chaplain in the German Army in France and Belgium, and after the war he worked for five years as a parish priest in the Schwabing district of Munich. In 1922, he went at his own request as a missionary to the Mapuche at Villarrica and Pucon in Southern Chile. Missionary and scientific activity in Chile Father Sebastian served in the Apostolic Vicariate of the Araucanía in Villarrica and Pucón, which at the time was administered almost entirely by Capuchins. There, in addition to his pastoral duties, he conducted ethnological and linguistic research into Mapuche culture and the Mapudungun language. From 1934 to 1938, he published studies in Araucanian literature, ethnology and folklore. During this period, his linguistic studies included an investigation of the relationship of Quechua and Aymara to the Mapuche language. Rapa Nui From 1935 for more than 30 years until his death, Father Sebastian worked as a missionary priest on Rapa Nui (Easter Island). At the time, he was perhaps the only non-Rapa Nui to have mastered their language. Although he celebrated Mass in Latin, he preached, heard confessions and catechized the faithful in the Rapa Nui language. He also translated popular Catholic devotions into Rapa Nui and encouraged native religious song. In 1964, he produced a history of the early activity of the French Sacred Hearts missionaries who first evangelized the island. Given the isolation of Rapa Nui during the period before air travel, Father Sebastian researched the language, ethnology and anthropology of Easter Island. His knowledge of Rapa Nui culture and prehistory impressed the scientific staff of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition of 1955. William Mulloy, a member of that expedition, writes:William Mulloy. 1969. \\"Sebastian Englert 1888-1969.\\" American Anthropologist 71:1110. :\\"I retain a sharp memory of a day shortly after our arrival, when he was asked to summarize his views of the local prehistory in a lecture to the expedition archaeologists. He presented a beautifully organized exposition based largely on his interpretations of painstakingly collected local genealogies and traditions. I wrote down everything I could...\\" Father Sebastian published several books, the most important being La tierra de Hotu Matu'a (The Land of Hotu Matu'a) a 1948 study of the history, archaeology, anthropology, and language of Easter Island. His research is best known to English-speakers through radio broadcasts for Chilean naval personnel in Antarctica, published in the United States as Island at the Center of the World: New Light on Easter Island. Father Sebastian arrived intending to stay only a short time on the island, but in February 1936 he received a letter, via a visiting ship of the Chilean navy, from his superior, Bishop Edwards, asking him to stay for two months more, which he did. However, it was almost a year until the next ship arrived, in January 1937. In that time he had revitalized the island's church, and had himself become attached to the island. The ship carried another letter from Bishop Edwards, appointing Father Sebastian as priest of Easter Island by attaching it to the \\"Apostolic Vicariate of Araucania\\". He was \\"strict, authoritarian and patriarchal\\" with the islanders, supported the Chilean authorities in making it difficult for islanders to travel, and publicly censured churchgoers in his sermons, based on information they gave him when privately confessing their sins, adversely affecting their ability to work and to buy imported goods, both of which were controlled by the state-backed island company. In historian Steven Roger Fischer's view, this may have contributed to the failure of the islanders to \\"internalize Catholicism fully during those crucial development years.\\" (See also History of Easter Island) Because of his work for the island's people, especially its lepers, Thor Heyerdahl, leader of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition, called Father Sebastian the \\"uncrowned king of Easter Island.\\"Thor Heyerdahl. 1960. Aku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island. Cardinal Giant edn. New York: Pocket Books. In 1963, Fr. Sebastian was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit) First Class by the Federal Republic of Germany. He died in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1969 during a lecture tour of the United States. His remains were returned to Rapa Nui and interred in the cemetery in the Tahai district, but were later transferred to the site of Holy Cross Church in Hanga Roa. In his will, he left all his books, his writings and his collection of native artifacts to the Government of Chile with the intention of forming a museum, but it wasn't until 1994 that the Father Sebastian Englert Anthropological Museum (MAPSE) was opened under the Chilean Directorate of Libraries, Archives and Museums (DiBAM). His papers, along with those of other researchers in Rapanui culture, are in the Biblioteca William Mulloy, which is administered by MAPSE. Publications * Englert, S. 2004.

It is the self-described \\"longest-running movie-themed webcomic\\", having run for over ten years from August 2, 2002 to December 31, 2012. With a personal and academic history with comics and design, Brazelton combined the two interests to develop Theater Hopper in 2002. The first characters are based on the artist and those close to him, requiring a thin line to be tread between reality and fantasy. The inclusion of original characters in 2004 allowed for more freedom in storytelling, as well as the introduction of story arcs. Emphasizing the writing over the art, Brazelton performs the latter with a combination of hand-drawn art and digital coloring. Over the years, Theater Hoppers schedule shifted from three times a week to once a week in 2010. The site began with receiving only about 50 unique visitors per day, but over the years, that number has fluctuated between 3,000–10,000. Brazelton covers the cost of running the site through advertising and selling physical books of Theater Hopper strips. History=Artist= From Des Moines, Iowa, Tom Brazelton was born an only child on December 21, 1977, and has been collecting comic books since age eight. Brazelton drew comics in middle school, and spent his high school and college years studying graphic design and print design. While in college at the University of Northern Iowa, Brazelton was a concert and album reviewer for the Northern Iowan, his college newspaper. When he started Theater Hopper in 2002, Brazelton was working as a freelance music reviewer for The Des Moines Register, in 2004 he worked at a movie theater for \\"about 8 months\\", and in 2006, he was a web designer for Allied Insurance. In 2007, Brazelton and his wife added their first child (a son, Henry) to the family. In February 2009, Brazelton was taking night classes in pursuit of his master's degree in communication leadership at Drake University. In December 2009, the Brazeltons added a second child (a daughter, Pearl) to their family. =Art= Before creating Theater Hopper, Brazelton created the website Des Moines Music Online (DMMO) to discuss the local music scene. Brazelton created DMMO to practice web design and enhance his heavily print media-based skill set; the site lasted about a year and a half, closing when it became too involved and intense for him to continue running solo. Looking for a new web project to further expand his repertoire of skills, Brazelton found Penny Arcade comics being run in The Official Playstation Magazine; Penny Arcade led him to PvP, and it was while reading these that Brazelton realized his interest in doing the same: \\"Webcomics were the perfect way to blend my interest in storytelling, illustration and web design.\\" Considering himself to be equally interested in music as he is film, Brazelton eschewed a music- interest based comic so as not to re-tread the paths beaten by web cartoonists Mitch Clem and Jeph Jacques. Premise Theater Hopper is a combination of character commentary on films (past, present, and future), and irregularly recurring segments focusing more on the characters and only tangentially on films. =Characters= Brazelton admitted in a 2003 interview that when he started the comic and was unsure as to its potential longevity, he fell back on using himself and those close to him to avoid writing backstories for potentially short-lived characters. This shortcut also hamstrings Brazelton's potential for development; he cannot reveal too much back story of the characters out of concern for their counterparts' privacy, yet he can't make something up because readers will attribute the fiction to the real person. In 2009, Brazelton confessed that if he were to go back with what he knew now, he would begin again with all-original characters, despite the artificial familiarity it breeds in his fans. The main characters which have been based on real people are author Tom, his wife Cami, their beagle Truman, and Tom's friend Jared. Brazelton has gone on record saying his young son, Henry, will not be joining the comic strip because of the limitations it would put on his and his wife's characters to be responsible and parental. ;Tom:Tom is based on the artist himself. Though his comic alter-ego tends to be \\"more offensive or ignorant about his surroundings\\", the artist and his doppelgänger have become more similar over the years than not. ;Cami:Also a graduate of the University of Northern Iowa, Cami is Tom's wife in real life and in the strip. When Brazelton first added her to the strip, he explained that she'd requested to be added and so he obliged. ;Jared:Jared is based on the real-life best friend of Brazelton's, and his inclusion in the comic was not initially with his counterpart's consent. Both Jareds (real and fictional) are married; his wife Patti makes only rare appearances in the comic because Brazelton is reluctant to sully her good nature with the strip's jokes. The character's signature vitriolic hatred for Ben Affleck and Shia LaBeouf—obviously exaggerated—stems from Brazelton's own dissatisfaction with the actors. ;Truman:Barzelton's dog Truman first appears over a month after the strip started (\\"The Truth\\") when his real-world counterpart (born ) was seven months old; Brazelton added him at the insistence of Cami. ;Jimmy:Jimmy first appeared a month after the strip debuted (in \\"Tumbleweeds\\") as \\"the hapless movie theater employee.\\" Jimmy is an original character, and was written to be an anomalous theater employee who actually enjoys working at the multiplex in contrast to theater workers with whom Brazelton was more accustomed. Brazelton describes Jimmy as \\"the moral center of the comic\\". ;Charlie:Charlie was introduced in the first strip of 2005 as an estranged friend of Cami's. She was added to the comic to provide more character development opportunities and make Theater Hopper as a whole more serialized and progressive. =Storytelling= Theater Hoppers first long story arc was in September 2004 when Jimmy was fired from his job at the multiplex for a short time; the 15-strip story lasts 33 days and resets things to the status quo at its end. Another arc followed in January 2005; running about a month-long, it introduced Charlie—an original (i.e. wholly fictional) character—to the strip. January-March 2009, Theater Hopper ran a third arc featuring Brazelton's original characters, Jimmy and Charlie, and explaining their intertwined backstories; Brazelton was inspired to write this storyline when writing Theater Hopper Year Three and re-reading the second arc to add commentary. Brazelton began introducing more recurring characters in the strip's third year (Jimmy & Charlie) in an effort to emulate Jeph Jacques' success with Questionable Content. The two introductory storylines featuring the new characters were popular with Brazelton's audience \\"because they showed a dimension to the characters that made the audience invest in them as creations. They weren't simply avatars for my out-there opinions about films and demonstrated I could stretch beyond gag-a-day joke writing.\\" He backed away from converting the theme of the entire strip when some alienated fans complained, and Brazelton felt as though he were abandoning his roots. COMIXtalk's Xaviar Xerexes described Theater Hopper as straddling the fence between two other popular film-based webcomics, Joe Loves Crappy Movies (a movie review in comic form), and Multiplex (a serialized, character-driven story); Xerexes likened Theater Hopper more to Penny Arcade or VG Cats as opposed to PvP or Questionable Content. The strip endeavors to remain realistic and plausible. Fantastical events and breaking the fourth wall occur infrequently; often—though not always—they're revealed to be characters' dreams or fantasies. Production=Writing= Forced to choose between the two in a 2008 interview, Brazelton claimed that the writing in his comics was more important than the art; \\"You can try to dazzle people [with your art] all you like and some people will fall for it. But most people see right through the deception.\\" Conceding his writing as the weakest point of Theater Hopper in 2006, Brazelton noted his tendency to be overly verbose, and how it was detrimental to his four-panel formatting and a difficult obstacle to overcome. Enjoying the writing of \\"Mamet, Sorkin, Whedon [and] Allen\\", Brazelton also feels the bizarre dry humor of Berkeley Breathed is a good match for his own sentiments. With the comic, Brazelton is careful not to label himself a critic, instead writing as a fan of movies and expressing his opinion through his characters. Though he was originally careful to analyze a topic from all sides before penning a script, he now eschews the pretense in favor of writing his \\"hard line\\" opinion and sticking with that. Brazelton admitted in a February 2009 interview to seeing fewer movies than previously due to professional and personal commitments. Whereas previously he and his wife would go and see upwards of 1–3 films each weekend, now the complications of hiring babysitters and attending class severely curtails their ability to see films together, leaving him to watch the film his wife wouldn't otherwise by himself. They make a concerted effort to watch all Best Picture nominees, and even this has proven difficult with their timetables. =Drawing= Brazelton cites comic books as the chief influence on his art style. Though an ardent admirer of Bill Watterson, Brazelton claimed he could not cite the artist as an influence, opining the skill of the former far outstripped that of himself; instead, he believes that Bill Amend is the professional comic artist whose style he most emulates. Despite drawing Theater Hopper in a traditional comic strip format, it was never Beazelton's intent to have it published as such (in a newspaper). Since 2003, Brazelton's comic-creation process involved pencilling and inking the strip (with Micron pens) before scanning them into Paint Shop Pro to color them; by December 2006 he had switched to the Adobe Photoshop program, and was spending less time on the process of creating the comic and instead polishing it with his increasing software skill. =Scheduling= The comic's schedule has varied over the years. Brazelton originally planned to run the comic on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule, though by mid-2006 he'd moved it to a Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday schedule. In May 2010, citing new full-time employment (coupled with personal obligations), Brazelton slowed down to only one strip a week (Mondays). In 2007, after the birth of his first child, the site occasionally replaced thrice-weekly comics with movie reviews while the Brazelton family adjusted to change and considered the future of Theater Hopper. After some time, the comics returned to their regular schedule and the reviews were scaled back, but continued. Reception In July 2006, Theater Hopper was receiving around 7,000 visitors per strip, a 14,000% increase from the 50 per strip when he began. A year later, Comic Book Resources reported the site received 6-10,000 \\"unique visitors per day\\". At Theater Hoppers height, the site was receiving 10,000 unique visitors a day. By November 2009 however, Brazelton admitted his traffic had fallen off somewhat, and was only receiving 3,000-4,000. Economics The site was never intended to be a money-maker or a career option for Brazelton, \\"It's a coincidence that I get money and keep the site self-supporting.\\" To support the comic, Brazelton initially asked visitors for a donation, which was very unproductive. He was more successful when he began selling t-shirts and posters featuring his comic, but it was still insufficient to cover Theater Hopper costs. By 2006, the site was utilizing advertising networks to sell ad space. Though he was dissatisfied with the aesthetic integration of advertising with his site design, the income-- initially a month--did begin to cover all of Brazelton's varied associated costs. Revenue from Theater Hopper was insufficient for Brazelton to not work a full-time job, and he did not foresee that changing. As of August 2007, the ratio of advertising to merchandising income from Theater Hopper was 70 to 30%, respectively. Publications In 2006, the first Theater Hopper book (Theater Hopper Year One) was created, financed by 100 pre-orders. Brazelton's impetus for the book was to generate a tangible version of the work that went into Theater Hopper for himself. Described as akin to audio commentary on DVDs, Year One provides background and behind-the-scenes information about the comics within. At least two more books have been published, following the same titling format (Theater Hopper Year X) as the original. Theater Hopper Year Three was pre-financed via a Kickstarter project. Theater Hopper was published for \\"about a year\\" in a Des Moines, Iowa alternative weekly. In 2008, film website FirstShowing.net partnered with Brazelton to republish Theater Hopper strips for 10 months in 2008. =The Triple Feature= Brazelton joins fellow film-comics Joe Dunn of Joe Loves Crappy Movies and Gordon McAlpin from Multiplex to produce a weekly podcast called The Triple Feature; begun in 2007, the three authors use the TalkShoe service to discuss films for an hour or so. The podcast is a feature for fans of the three webcomics, it also cross-promotes the three comics, and provides sounding boards of equal fanaticism for the three.

Fragments of his handbooks summarizing Stoic and Peripatetic doctrines are preserved by Stobaeus and Eusebius. Life Arius was a citizen of Alexandria. Augustus esteemed him so highly, that after the conquest of Alexandria, he declared that he spared the city chiefly for the sake of Arius.Plutarch, Ant. 80, Apophth.; Dio Cassius, li. 16; Julian, Epistles, 51; comp. Strabo, xiv. According to Plutarch, Arius advised Augustus to execute Caesarion, the son of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, with the words \\"ouk agathon polukaisarie\\" (\\"it's not good to have too many Caesars\\"), a pun on a line in Homer.David Braund et al, Myth, history and culture in republican Rome: studies in honour of T.P. Wiseman, University of Exeter Press, 2003, p.305. The original line was \\"ouk agathon polukoiranie\\": \\"Too many leaders are not good\\" or \\"the rule of many is a bad thing\\" (Homer, Iliad, Bk. II. vers. 204 and 205). In Greek \\"polukaisarie\\" is a variation on \\"polukoiranie\\". \\"Kaisar\\" (Caesar) replacing \\"Koiran(os)\\", meaning \\"leader\\". Arius as well as his two sons, Dionysius and Nicanor, are said to have instructed Augustus in philosophy.Suetonius, Augustus, 89. He is frequently mentioned by Themistius, who says that Augustus valued him not less than Agrippa.Themistius, Orat. v., viii., x., xiii From QuintilianQuintilian, ii. 15. § 36, iii. 1. § 16 it appears that Arius also taught or wrote on rhetoric.Comp. Seneca, consol. ad Marc. 4; Aelian, Varia Historia, xii. 25; Suda He is presumably the \\"Arius\\" whose Life was among those in the missing final section of book VII of the Lives of Diogenes Laërtius.Richard Hope, 1930, The book of Diogenes Laertius: its spirit and its method, page 17. Philosophy Arius Didymus is usually identified with the Arius whose works are quoted at length by Stobaeus, summarising Stoic, Peripatetic and Platonist philosophy.Sedley, D., \\"The School, from Zeno to Arius Didymus\\" in Inwood, B. (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 32. That his full name is Arius Didymus we know from Eusebius, who quotes two long passages of his concerning Stoic views on God; the conflagration of the Universe; and the soul.Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, xv. 15, 18, 19, 20.

Kuna, N. Venclová (eds.), Whither Archeology? Papers in Honour of Evžen Neustupný. Institute of Archeology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague: 172–203, 1995. contributes to the Proto-Indo-European Urheimat issue and proposes a cultural melting pot in the Neolithic of Northern Europe of foreign Neolithic farmers and indigenous Mesolithic hunter- gatherer communities that resulted in the genesis of the Indo-European language family. The hypothesis holds that the linguistic and cultural influence of the Neolithic farmers was far greater than the persistence of their foreign gene pool. According to Zvelebil, the linguistic influence of indigenous hunter-gatherers predominated, but other archeologists, such as Marek Nowak, \\"Transformations in East-Central Europe from 6000 to 3000 BC: local vs. foreign patterns.\\" Marek Nowak, Institute of Archeology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland, Documenta Praehistorica XXXIII, 2006, Neolithic Studies 13 favor a scenario compatible to Colin Renfrew's Anatolian hypothesis in attributing the leading linguistic role to the foreign farmers. Archaeological evidence A study of strontium isotope signatures among the Neolithic farmers in Southwestern Germany indicated that the first Linear Pottery culture farmers received their partners from a wide catchment, were patrilocal and intermarried with hunter-gatherer women along the agricultural frontier.Bentley R.A., Chikhi L. and Price T.D. \\"The Neolithic transition in Europe: comparing broad scale genetic and local scale isotopic evidence\\". Antiquity 77 (295): 63–66, 2003 The appearance of Mesolithic motifs on the first Funnel Beaker culture pottery and of other elements in the material culture has been adduced in support of such results. Marek Zvelebil. Homo habitus: agency, structure and the transformation of tradition in the constitution of the TRB foraging farming communities in the North European Plain (ca. 4500–2000 BC), Department of Archeology, University of Sheffield, UK, Documenta Praehistorica XXXII (2005) p. 87–101. © 2005 Oddelek za arheologijo, Filozofska fakulteta – Univerza v Ljubljani, SI It was theorized the intermarriage between the two communities resulted in the breakdown of the early farming Linear Pottery culture and the Lengyel culture social and ideological structure as well as a subsequent development of a new foraging- farming community, which was identified archaeologically as the Funnel Beaker culture. That caused the combination of cultural traditions of earlier foraging and farming generations to be accomplished in an act of cultural creolisation. In the Polish Plain, the pattern persisted during some 2500 years, between 4400 and 1800 BC or 2200 BC, until the last hunter-gatherer communities finally became part of the Globular Amphorae/Corded Ware cultural horizon. They led to a cognitive structure that was more familiar to the indigenous hunter-gatherer community but still retained certain earlier routine practices of both the ancestral Neolithic and Mesolithic traditions. The cultural variability of the Funnel Beaker culture horizon and the later Globular Amphorae and Corded Ware traditions was proposed to be caused, at least partially, by that process. Anthropological evidence A more anthropological perspective is proposed to confirm the concept of farmer communities being \\"acculturated\\" by neighboring foragers.Interactions between hunter-gatherers and farmers in the Early and Middle Neolithic in the Polish part of the North European Plain – Arkadiusz Marciniak. In D. Papagianni & R. Layton (eds.), Time and Change. Archaeological and Anthropological Perspectives on the Long-Term in Hunter-Gatherer Societies, 115–133. Oxbow: Oxford, 2008 (approved) Investigations revealed low paleaodemographic values of Linear Pottery farmers and Corded Ware culture populations with dominant agricultural occupations. The highest values correspond to Corded Ware culture populations, using a husbandry mode of production.Cultural adaptive strategies in the Neolithic in central Europe within the context of palaeodemographic studies. Arkadiusz Marciniak, Journal of European Archaeology (JEA), 1, 1993/1, p. 141–151 Linguistic evidence Frederik Kortlandt's assessment takes into account the typological similarity of Proto-Indo-European to the Northwest Caucasian languages. Assuming that the similarity can be attributed to areal factors, Kortlandt thought of Indo-European as a branch of Uralo- Altaic that was transformed under the influence of a Caucasian-like substratum. Frederik Kortlandt: The spread of the Indo-Europeans, 1989 Kortlandt had in mind areal factors that would be essentially in agreement with the Kurgan hypothesis and an origin in the eastern part of the Great European Plain. That should be kept distinct from linguist Peter Schrijver's speculation on the reminiscent lexical and typological features of a family of languages featuring complex verbs, a structural type of which the Northwest Caucasian languages are the sole survivors in the region, Peter Schrijver. Keltisch en de buren: 9000 jaar taalcontact; ('Celtic and the neighbours: 9000 years of language contact'), University of Utrecht, March 2007. which he links to the archeological Linear Pottery culture, the first farmers in Europe. Under the Anatolian hypothesis, they are supposed to have been Indo-European- speaking, but Schrijver's proposal, like Kortlandt's, is compatible with the Kurgan paradigm, as Schrijver suggests they spoke languages from a completely different family, which typologically resembled Hattic, Minoan and Northwest Caucasian. The family is presumed to have not influence any Indo-European language spoken in the steppes, but to have influenced Indo-European languages spoken in Central and Southeastern Europe (Germanic, Celtic, Italic and Greek) during the Bronze and the Iron Ages.

History Hubbard Woods and the other two Metra stations in Winnetka were built by the former Chicago and North Western Railway. These stations were originally built at grade level like all other Union Pacific/North Line stations north of Evanston Central Street. However, the grade crossings were not very safe, and accidents at railroad crossings resulted in twenty-nine deaths between 1912 and 1937. After two prominent Winnetka women were killed by a train at the Pine Street crossing in October 1937, the community of Winnetka demanded that something be done about the railroad crossings. It was decided that the railroad tracks would be lowered into a below-grade trench to eliminate street crossings.

It is located on the tripoint of Belgrade's municipalities of Zvezdara, Palilula and Vračar, and served by the underground Vukov Spomenik railway station.  Location  Underground station Vukov spomenik Escalators at Vukov Spomenik station Vukov Spomenik is located on the crossroad of the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra and Ruzveltova street, in the valley between the north-eastern slopes of the Vračar and western slopes of the Zvezdara hills. It borders the neighborhoods of Tašmajdan on the west and Palulula and Hadžipopovac on the north (in Palilula municipality), Slavujev Venac on the north-east and Đeram on the north (in Zvezdara municipality) and Krunski Venac and Kalenić in the south.  History  Below the modern monument and railway station, there is an underground water well, sort of a \\"twin\\" of the better known Roman Well in the Belgrade Fortress. The well was built on the same principle and being about the same depth as its fortress counterpart, which was is not \\"Roman\\" but was actually built by the Austrians in the first half of the 18th century. The area of the future Vukov Spomenik was the location of the first Serbian hippodrome. It was moved to the neighborhood of Marinkova Bara in the 1890s. Area of the former race tracks was turned into the park in 1907. It developed into the modern Park Ćirilo i Metodije in 1928, projected by Sava Nikolić. The park was named after one of the first Slavic enlighteners, Cyril and Methodius. The park was renovated in May 2017 when seedlings of horse-chestnut, red horse-chestnut and the weeping birch were planted. The area formed an eastern outskirts of Belgrade until the 1930s. A football field was set in the area and the oldest campus in Serbia was built here, too, in 1928. A donor of the campus was king Alexander I of Yugoslavia, so the campus was named \\"King Alexander the First\\". Prior to World War II, the campus was used as a seat of the Grand Lodge of Yugoslavia's Freemasons. In 1937, on the corner of the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra and Ruzveltova street, a monument to Vuk Karadžić (by sculptor Đorđe Jovanović), a major reformer of Serbian language, celebrating 150 years of his birth, was erected.Politika daily, July 16, 2007, p.25 After the monument, the entire neighborhood got its name (Vukov spomenik is Serbian for Vuk's monument). The entire neighborhood developed into an academic area, as University Library, Archives of Serbia and Technical faculties are located here.  Characteristics  Apart from its academic function, Vukov Spomenik is one of the busiest traffic spots in Belgrade, being on or near the crossroads of some of the most frequently used transportation routes (Bulevar kralja Aleksandra, Ruzveltova, Kraljice Marije, Cvjićeva streets). Additionailly, \\"Vukov Spomenik\\" is also one of the underground train stations of the future Belgrade Metro, which for now operates as part of the Belgrade-Pančevo railway (local Beovoz rail, connecting Nova Pazova (in province of Vojvodina), Belgrade and Pančevo (in Vojvodina again). One of the landmarks in the neighborhood is the \\"King Alexander I Student residence\\". The three-storey building was constructed in 1927 and designed by the Russian white émigré architect Đorđe Kovaljevski. Massive, white building at 75 Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra, is designed in the Academic Empire style. The edifice is too pompous for the students' dormitory. Risalit is ornamented with four columns and two pilasters, all with Ionic capitals. Ornamented garlands divide the façade and architrave beam is cut in order to enhance the Empire style gable. The top arch is bordered with reliefs and marked by two antique amphoras which \\"guard\\" the arch. Sides are less decorated, but the ornaments are massive. Back façade faces the park and is lightened with the restaurant's terrace. In terms of architecture, the building is designed outside of the vogue of the day, appears \\"too heavy\\" and shows weaknesses of the Russian architectural schools (\\"fear of winter\\", like narrow windows, etc.). The building was declared a cultural monument. Administratively, Vukov Spomenik is a local community (mesna zajednica, sub-municipal administrative unit) in its Zvezdara section, with a population of 9,529 by the 2011 census. Since the 1980s it includes the local community of Stari Đeram. Additionally, it is a main administrative center of the municipality of Zvezdara as a whole, as the Municipal assembly of Zvezdara is located here. For decades, the neighborhood is known for the Vukovci. They are physical, manual and construction day laborers, who gather at the park, along the Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra, at least since the 1960s. Some even sleep on the benches in the park. They wait for the contractors who come to pick workers they need for that day. This black labor market is in Serbia colloquially styled the \\"street labor market\\". The workers originate not just from Belgrade, but from the entire Serbia, mostly southern and Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are on average older, former workers from the failed factories, but some are well educated. In the 1970s, when Belgrade was growing exponentially, there were up to 400 workers daily, but by the 2020 there were no more than 20-30. They share their nickname, Vukovci, with the A grade elementary pupils, who are given the \\"Vuk Diploma\\", also named after Vuk Karadžić. This is a frequent source of misnomer jokes.

The first plans for connection of Görlitz with Waldenburg (Wałbrzych) via Hirschberg (Jelenia Góra) and further to Glatz (Kłodzko) appeared in 1853. The Kingdom of Prussia intended to build a direct railway link from Berlin to Vienna, bypassing the Kingdom of Saxony. However, the Austrian Empire did not favor a construction major railway line running parallel to its border. Rail network in and around Lower Silesia, lines electrified by 1939 in red. As the industrialization of Germany progressed, the original plan was reconsidered several years later. On 24 September 1862 the Prussian parliament approved construction of a railway line from Görlitz to Waldenburg with a branch line to Kohlfurt (Węgliniec). The line was built stepwise; the last section was opened on 16 August 1867. The first section was electrified by 1915. Due to the First World War the electrification was not finished until 1 September 1923. The railway was one of the first German electrified lines. Before the Second World War it was used to transport vast amounts of Silesian hard coal to Saxony and the Province of Brandenburg. The railway was included in Polish territory in 1945 according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement.

It is located in a National Historic Landmark building known as the Russian-American Magazin and the Erskine House, which also houses the office of the Kodiak Historical Society. Built c. 1810, the building is the oldest of four surviving building constructed by the Russians when Alaska was a Russian territory. The museum's collections and exhibits are focused on the history of the Kodiak Archipelago and the Aleutian Islands, with particular focus on the Russian and early American periods. The museum's current director is Sarah Harrington. Architecture and building history The community now known as Kodiak was established in 1793 as Pavlovsk, and was the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, and served as its territorial capital until 1808. This building was built in the first decade of the 19th century as a storage facility (or \\"magazine\\") by the Russian American Company. When Alaska came under American control, the building was purchased by the Alaska Commercial Company, which continued the business operations previously engaged in by the Russians. In 1911 the building was sold to W. J. Erskine, who used the building as a private residence, constructing a new stone foundation for the building and enclosing its porch. He sold it in 1948 to a company which rented it out. After the 1964 Alaska earthquake and tsunami damaged the city, the building was acquired by a government redevelopment authority. Ownership was eventually transferred to the city, which leased it in 1967 to the Kodiak Historical Society. The society has since maintained the property, using it for office space and as a museum. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. and The building is a large rectangular log structure, now resting on a concrete foundation (replacing Erskine's stone foundation). It is 2-1/2 stories in height, deep and wide, with a projecting front porch that is partially glassed in. It is finished in horizontal redwood siding, which covers older siding which may be Russian in origin. It has a steeply-pitched gable roof, which is pierced on its main (southern) elevation by a single gabled dormer. The building's interior has been extensively altered to accommodate the historical society's uses, but much of its older fabric is still evident. The interior was originally divided into two large chambers separated by a log dividing wall that is still extant (with doorways cut through it at a later date), and the material that make up the stairwell to the second floor also appear to be original. The upstairs has flooring that appears to be typical Russian manufacture.

A \\"handsome\\" stained glass window had been placed in the church by the inhabitants of the village in memory of a former rector. The living was combined with that of Parva, with the church register dating from 1696. Parva contained a Wesleyan and a Free Methodist chapel. A National School at Magna, built in 1853 and enlarged in 1874, held 150 children, with an average attendance of 130. The land of both parishes was described as heavy, and mixed with flint and chalk.

The primary school was one of a few in the country to be involved with the Science and Technology through Educational Links with Amateur Radio education charity. The school was closed in 2009 because of declining pupil numbers, and after a local campaign to prevent closure was unsuccessful. Montagu C. Allwood and his brothers, who grew up in a farming family in the village, moved to south of Burgess Hill in Sussex to build a plant nursery, which is now the largest retailer of carnation plants in the world.

The villagers of Voué buried the air crew and tended the graves for many years until the link with Ludford was discovered. Ludford and Voué are now twinned, with regular visits between the two. There is a No. 101 Squadron RAF reunion every year in early September, with a fly past over the village of an Avro Lancaster PA474 from RAF Coningsby, the only bomber remaining in the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. There is a memorial stone for the base in the village. The squadron suffered the greatest number of casualties of any RAF Bomber Command squadron. During the Cold War the station was home to Thor Intermediate Range Ballistic Nuclear Missiles, each with 1.44 megaton warheads. =2008 earthquake= On 27 February 2008 at 00.26 am Ludford was at the epicentre of an earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale. Despite the strength of the earthquake no damage was sustained to the village. To celebrate the village's place in UK earthquake history, the White Hart Inn commissioned a beer that was brewed by a local microbrewery. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches south to Scamblesby with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 2,128. Geography Ludford lies in East Lindsey, just outside its bordering region, West Lindsey. It sits on the long (Magna Mile) section of the east to west A631 Market Rasen to Louth road. Ludford sits in an area of outstanding natural beauty at the northern edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds. From the B1225/A631 crossroads, to the west of the village, the parish boundary (also that of East and West Lindsey), follows the B1225 northwards, bordering North Willingham. It briefly borders Tealby along the B1225, the parish and district boundary moves from the B1225 eastwards through Kirmond Hall, bordering Kirmond le Mire. South of Walmsley Holt the boundary moves eastwards from the district boundary. It passes south of Spottle Hill Farm and Low Farm, and east of Tows Farm, at Great Tows on the road to Ludborough, it meets Calcethorpe with Kelstern. It crosses the A631 around west of the village centre. At this point it follows the start of the River Bain southwards, east of the deserted medieval villages of West Wykeham and East Wykeham, which are part of the parish. At Bain Wood, where the two tributaries of the River Bain meet, it meets Burgh on Bain. It passes north-west along the eastern edge of Wykeham Plantation, on the western edge of Wykeham Pond, and along another (western) tributary of the River Bain, south of the deserted West Wykeham. It crosses Girsby Lane to the south-west, and then south-west along the western edge of Harpgates Plantation and the eastern edge of the former RAF Ludford Magna, until it meets the B1225 and Hainton. A mile north along the B1225 it meets Sixhills and West Lindsey. West of Gally Hill Farm it meets North Willingham. Community The Ludford Village Hall Committee produces the newsletter The Magna Messenger.The Magna Messenger , February 2011. Retrieved 30 October 2011 The parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Mary, and has the 101 Squadron Roll of Honour. The village public house, on the A631, is the White Hart Inn. The nearest regular bus service is at Burgh on Bain, although the Callconnect network provides a pre-booked bus service for the village, with links to the market towns of Louth and Market Rasen.

Lee at the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum in Shreveport In the summer of 1870, Robert E. Lee won a famed steamboat race against Natchez, going from New Orleans to St. Louis, Missouri, a distance of , in 3 days, 18 hours and 14 minutes. John W. Cannon, the captain of Robert E. Lee, ensured victory by removing excess weight, carrying only a few passengers, and using prearranged barges to increase the speed of refueling. Natchez finished the race several hours later, but had been delayed by fog for six hours, and had numerous passengers to weigh it down. She received a silver bowl trophy containing the name of the Robert E. Lee. On December 22, 1870 she collided with the Potomac opposite Natchez, Mississippi. The Lee sustained much damage and was run out on a sandbar until she could be raised and repaired. Noted steamboat captain and historian Frederick Way, Jr., disputes this version of history somewhat. He cites Johnny Farrell, second engineer of Natchez: \\"This old idea about the two boats preparing for days for the race, tearing down bulkheads, putting up wind sheaves, and a lot of other stuff, is not true. When I went aboard Robert E. Lee, all they had done was to move the coal bunkers a little forward... On our boat there was absolutely no preparation whatever. There was no such thing as colors flying, bands playing, and the decks of both boats crowded with ladies and gentlemen.\\" Way also writes that at Vicksburg, both boats took fuel flats in tow and emptied them under way. In addition, both vessels advertised before the race that they would accept freight and passengers.Way, Frederick, Jr. She Takes the Horns: Steamboat Racing on Western Waters, pp. 71–81, Young & Klein, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, 1953. To this day no commercial boat has beaten the speed record set by Robert E. Lee during the race. However, Bogie, a 1929 motor boat built by Leroy Craft, beat Robert E. Lees record.The Atlanta Constitution July 26, 1929 It usually ran between New Orleans and Natchez, Mississippi. However, during spans of bad business, it would forsake Natchez and instead go to St. Louis or Louisville, Kentucky. Fate Robert E. Lee, another drawing by Samuel Ward Stanton On December 22, 1870 she collided with the Potomac opposite Natchez, Mississippi. The Lee sustained much damage and was run out on a sandbar until she could be raised and repaired. She brought her record cotton cargo of 5741 bales to New Orleans in 1874. When she left New Orleans for Portland, Kentucky, for dismantling, mid-April, 1876, several thousand came to see her off, with many salutes en route to mark the closing of her career. Her hull was taken to Memphis for use as a wharf boat. Much of her equipment went into her successor, also known as the second Robert E Lee (1876–1882). She carried much of the equipment and furnishings from her predecessor..The New York Times, October 1, 1882 A stern wheel replica named The Lt. Robert E. Lee (as first lieutenant of engineers in 1837, the future general supervised the engineering work for St. Louis harbor) was built in 1969 based on an old Corps of Engineers hull.

It ceased to exist as a jurisdiction in 1964, when by referendum it consolidated with the city of Green Bay. Monolith erected in 1959 to honor Preble's centennial Origin of town name The town's name may originate from Commodore Edward Preble, who served in the Tripolitan War of 1803. It is also possible that Peter Faenger, who migrated from Preble, Germany, named the town, or that Chauncey N. Aldrich named it after his birthplace of Preble, New York. History Peter Faenger and a group of German settlers first occupied the area in 1836. One of the first buildings erected by the early settlers was a church served by a priest from Green Bay. According to the few extant memoirs from the time, \\"the farm houses were made of hewn logs, chinked with mud, roofed with hand split shingles, floored with rough planks, and gathered in small groups, along the highway.\\" In 1859, a petition \\"good and sufficient\\" was presented to the Brown County Board asking that a town be set off from the town of Green Bay, and that the town be called the Town of Preble. Thus, on the morning of July 13, 1859, the County Board ordered that the new town be established. The 1860 census indicates a population of 520 people in the town. 40% of the 113 families were of German descent; however, Preble also had immigrant Irish, Canadians, Hollanders, and Belgians.http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid- idx?c=wiarchives;cc=wiarchives;view=text;rgn=main;didno=uw-whs-brow0038 The first town elections occurred in 1859 at the house of Ed Rothe. Chauncey N. Aldrich was elected town chairman, a position he held for 26 years. On November 21, 1861, a post office was established, with Ed Rothe appointed postmaster. Because of the costs of the Civil War, the post office discontinued operations on August 1, 1864. The Preble School District was organized in 1866 with the building of Finger School. Town meetings were held in various homes until a town hall was built in 1895. Farming and dairy were the first occupations of the town, with industry coming later.The Preble Buzz =Consolidation with Green Bay= In the 1920s, the town began to experience problems resulting from increasing urbanization. It had to deal with sewage disposal, water quality, and schools for the growing number of children in the area. There was also friction with the neighboring City of Green Bay. Although many citizens felt a change in government was necessary, heated debate arose about what steps to take. The town had three possibilities: remain as a town and be annexed piece-by-piece by the City of Green Bay, incorporate as a village or city that would give Preble definite boundaries, or consolidate with the city. While few supported remaining as a town, two large groups formed in support of the other two options. One group argued that Preble was a logical part of the city and could benefit overall by consolidating with Green Bay, while the other group saw Preble as a self-sufficient community that could thrive on its own. Preble tried to incorporate as a city in the 1950s, but the Wisconsin Circuit Court and the State Planning Commission barred the town from doing so. Ultimately, on November 3, 1964, the consolidation with Green Bay was approved by referendum. At the time of consolidation, Preble's boundaries extended east of the East River, west of the towns of Humboldt and Eaton, north of Bellevue, and south of the town of Scott.http://www.ci.green- bay.wi.us/history/1960s.html Its population was 12,000, making it one of the largest towns in Wisconsin. The consolidation of nearly doubled the City of Green Bay, allowing for the easterly development of the city. =Centennial celebration= The Town of Preble held its centennial celebration at Preble Park in September 1959. The two-day event included a community picnic, dance contests, and a parade that started at Danz School and ended at Preble Park. A large granite monument was erected to celebrate 100 years of growth.http://search.greenbaypressgazette.com/sp?aff=1100&skin;=100&keywords;=Sunny+Skies+Greet+Opening+of+Centennial&x;=17&y;=17 Education Green Bay Preble High School is a legacy of the former town.

The screenplay by Oscar Saul, Dean Riesner, Stephen Longstreet, and Nelson Gidding is based on the life and career of torch singer/actress Helen Morgan, with fictional touches liberally added for dramatic purposes. This turned out to be Blyth's final film role. Another version of Morgan's life story, Helen Morgan, was produced as a live television drama on Playhouse 90, with Polly Bergen as Morgan. Despite requests to delay the television version, it aired five months before the release of the motion picture. Plot Helen Morgan begins her career as a Chicago carnival dancer. She catches the eye of fast-talking, double-dealing Larry Maddux, whose promotion catapults her to fame as a Broadway performer in Show Boat and a headliner in her own nightclub. Helen is involved in two romantic relationships - with Maddux, and with wealthy attorney Russell Wade - each of which cause her great anguish. When she realizes the caddish Maddux has been merely using her to support the upscale lifestyle he has come to enjoy, she turns to alcohol. Wade, who is genuinely in love with Helen, is nonetheless married and a divorce is impossible; this helps drive her further into the bottle. She loses the bulk of her money to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Wall Street Crash of 1929, hits rock bottom and, finally is hospitalized in the alcoholic ward of Bellevue. Maddux has a redemptive change of heart and arranges a gala dinner, hosted by Walter Winchell and Florenz Ziegfeld, in Helen's honor. The film's ending suggests this was her first step on the road to recovery, success, and happiness; this, however, was not the case for the real Helen Morgan.

Weiler called the film \\"as uplifting as soap opera\\" and added, \\"The indestructible tunes and the producers' fairly honest approach to the sleaziness of the speakeasy era should generate genuine nostalgia, but Miss Morgan's career, on film, appears to be uninspired, familiar fare...It's all about as heart-warming as an electric pad. Ann Blyth...desperately attempts to capture the essentially moving qualities of the performer...[she] is fragile, sweet and timorous in the role, but she cannot manage to project the idea that she is swaying audiences either by singing or emotional force.\\" Variety called it \\"little more than a tuneful soap opera\\" and added, \\"The story line sometimes strains credulity and the dialogue situations occasionally give the production a cornball flavor...Director Michael Curtiz has done a good job with the material at hand, injecting a pacing and bits of business that help maintain interest, and the production gets added benefit from a series of hit tunes of the era...Blyth turns in a sympathetic but not always convincing performance. Newman is very good as the rackets guy, giving the part authority and credibility.\\" TV Guide wrote \\"Helen Morgan was the greatest torch singer, a petite brunette who sat atop pianos plaintively warbling sad songs about the men who mistreated her. More a profile of those songs than a detailed exposition of her life, this film offers only a slice of a fabulous and unforgettable career...most of the wobbly plot is fictional, which is unfortunate since Morgan's true story was much more spectacular and, had it been followed, would have provided a finer film.\\" See also * List of American films of 1957 ReferencesExternal links * The Helen Morgan Story at the Internet Movie Database Category:1957 films Category:1950s biographical drama films Category:American musical drama films Category:1950s musical drama films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American films Category:Biographical films about singers Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:American films based on actual events Category:Films based on television plays Category:Films directed by Michael Curtiz Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Cultural depictions of pop musicians Category:1957 drama films ","title":"The Helen Morgan Story"},{"id":"15107093","text":"Loncopué is a department located in the west of Neuquén Province, Argentina.

A National Historic Landmark, it is the only Russian colonial commercial structure standing in Sitka, and one of only two Russian colonial buildings in the city (the other is the Russian Bishop's House, also a National Historic Landmark.) Description The original portion of the building is a square log structure, 2-1/2 stories tall, measuring about (four sazhen) square, and resting on a raised stone foundation. A two-story gallery, sheltered by a shed roof, extended to the east. The outside logs from which it is built were squared off to . The interior walls are built from dimensionally smaller logs, and the floors were made of half-logs secured into joists and sills by tenons. The structure is estimated to have been built in the 1840s, at a time when many buildings were built by Finnish laborers brought in by Russian administrators, and was first used as for residential purposes. The building has undergone a number of alterations in the intervening time, but these have managed to preserve much of its historic fabric. It is unknown if it was sided at the time of its construction, but early images depict it with the same type of shiplap siding it has today. Early images also show a two- story ell to its rear. The building was originally built with its back directly on the waterfront; infill has created new land in this area. In the 1880s the building underwent significant alterations. An addition extended the gallery area further to the east, and a new roof fully incorporated this space into the structure. Window spacing on this addition was made to match that of the main block, and the new roof was augmented by four equally-spaced gable- roof dormers. The building underwent further modernizing work in the 1960s, some of which was in response to deterioration of the log structure. It was the subject of a major rehabilitative effort in the mid-1980s.

Rather than trying to save himself by jumping overboard, Tatum remained in the carrier to aid and comfort the wounded. He apparently went down with the ship when she sank. For his \\"gallant and intrepid conduct,\\" Lt. Comdr. Tatum was awarded the Silver Star Medal posthumously. Namesake In 1943, the destroyer escort USS Tatum (DE-789) was named in his honor.

Filming had finally ended with a production inauguration on 24 May 2006.Fatal Contact Wraps; Wu Jing vs Xing Yu - Wu-Jing.org =Fight choreography= The fight sequences were choreographed by Nicky Li, a member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. Li had served as choreographer and stunt coordinator for Dennis Law's previous two films The Unusual Youth and Love @ First Note. In Beijing, China, Wu Jing prepared for his role by training in Sanshou martial arts. Wu admitted to receiving injuries on set, and described the film as his toughest work to date. His manager, Paco Wong, arranged for him to stay in a special hostel, as he would be staying in Hong Kong during the two-month shoot. During filming, Wu had to deal with different opponents each day, and had to use various techniques against them. He also worked very closely with Li, discussing and exploring various moves with him They would try out different moves before demonstrating to the rest of the cast. The major fight scene between Wu and Xing Yu required two rehearsals before proceeding to actual filming, which was done in two takes. The production crew also took extra precaution when filming action scenes involving Ronald Cheng as Cheng had not recovered from a previous waist injured. Prior to filming, Cheng had sought guidance from Wu, and discovered several fatal moves in the art of combat, one of which resulted in a thumb injury caused by Wu.

It contains the type and only species Razanandrongobe sakalavae, named in 2004 by Simone Maganuco and colleagues based on isolated bones found in 2003. The remains, which included a fragment of maxilla and teeth, originated from the Bathonian-aged Sakaraha Formation of Mahajanga, Madagascar. While they clearly belonged to a member of the Archosauria, Maganuco and colleagues refrained from assigning the genus to a specific group because the fragmentary remains resembled lineages among both the theropod dinosaurs and crocodylomorphs. Further remains (including a premaxilla and lower jawbone) had been discovered as early as 1972, but were not described until 2017 by Cristiano Dal Sasso and colleagues. These remains allowed them to confidently assign Razanandrongobe as the oldest-known member of the Notosuchia, a group of crocodylomorphs, which partially filled a gap of 74 million years in the group's evolutionary history. Razanandrongobe shows a number of adaptations to a diet containing bones and tendons, including teeth with large serrations and bony structures reinforcing its palate and teeth. Measuring long, it was the largest member of the Notosuchia and may have occupied a predatory ecological niche similar to theropods. Discovery and naming=Initial discovery= Map showing local geology around upright=1.25 All known remains of Razanandrongobe originate from strata belonging to the Sakaraha Formation in the badlands (locally called tanety) surrounding the town of Ambondromamy, Madagascar. In October 2001, Giovanni Pasini first verified the presence of fossil-bearing strata in this region. During an associated field survey of the locality, local collectors discovered two tooth-bearing skull fragments on the surface of the ground, which belonged to two different kinds of reptiles. These fragments were later acquired by Gilles Emringer and Francois Escuillié from Gannat, France, who intended to make them available for research. Based on the potential for further research, four temporary permits were obtained in the area for exploration from the Mining Cadastral Office of Madagascar. In April 2003, a joint team from the Milan Natural History Museum (MSNM) and Civic Museum of Fossils of Besano launched a privately-funded expedition to the region. Pasini collected a number of teeth during this expedition. In June 2003, he gained access to one of the two skull fragments, a maxilla, and recognized that the teeth were identical. The MSNM acquired this specimen; it is now catalogued as MSNM V5770, while the teeth are catalogued as MSNM V5771-5777. Simone Maganuco, Cristiano Dal Sasso, and Pasini described these specimens in 2006 as representing a new genus and species, Razanandrongobe sakalavae, with MSNM V5770 as the holotype. The genus name is a composite of the Malagasy words \\"razana-\\" (ancestor), \\"androngo-\\" (lizard), and \\"-be\\" (large), collectively meaning \\"ancestor of the large lizard\\". The species name is Latin for \\"of Sakalava\\", referring to the ethnic group which inhabits the region. =Additional specimens= Dentary and premaxilla, MHNT.PAL.2012.6.1–2, from the same individual of Razanandrongobe Between 1972 to 1974, the assistant director of technical services of the Sugar Company of Mahavavy had previously collected a dentary (lower jawbone) and a premaxilla from the area where the holotype of Razanandrongobe was discovered. Under the authorization of the Mines and Energy Directorate of Madagascar, these specimens were exported and stored in the collection of D. Descouens. After they were prepared, these fossils were discovered to pertain to Razanandrongobe; based on the fact that they fit together perfectly, they were further inferred to belong to the same individual. In April 2012, these specimens were acquired by Museum of Natural History of Toulouse (MHNT), where they are respectively catalogued as MHNT.PAL.2012.6.1 and MHNT.PAL.2012.6.2. The MHNT also acquired six skull fragments from Descouens, which are catalogued as MHNT.PAL.2012.6.3–8. The source locality of these specimens is unknown. Among these fragments, the larger ones are spongy with pieces of the surrounding rock (matrix) attached; the smaller ones are denser, whitish, and polished, suggesting prolonged exposure to air and sunlight. The MSNM acquired a further specimen, a tooth crown catalogued as MSNM V7144. This specimen had been collected by the Italian agronomist G. Cortenova, who gave the specimen to the amateur entomologist G. Colombo before his death. Colombo donated the specimen to the MSNM. All of these additional specimens were described in 2017 by Dal Sasso, Pasini, Maganuco, and Guillaume Fleury. Description Left to right: Skull of Razanandrongobe (viewed from below) compared to giant crocodyliforms Machimosaurus, Barinasuchus, Sarcosuchus, the saltwater crocodile Crocodylus porosus, and Purussaurus Based on available remains, Razanandrongobe is the largest known Jurassic non-marine member of the Mesoeucrocodylia, and the largest member of the Notosuchia overall. In life, the length of its skull likely surpassed that of Barinasuchus, which has been estimated at long. Dal Sasso and colleagues inferred a body shape similar to the Baurusuchidae, producing an overall length of , a height at the hip of , and a weight of . =Snout= upright=0.8 Razanandrongobe had a highly specialized skull, with a robust and rounded (U-shaped) snout that was taller than it was wide (oreinirostral), like Dakosaurus. At the front of the snout, the openings of the bony nostrils, the apertura nasi ossea, faced forward, and were fused at the midline. Smooth depressions known as the perinarial fossae extended down from the nostrils to the level of the teeth. The remainder of the premaxilla had a roughened surface, covered in crests, ridges, and pits. On the palate, two sub-circular depressions were situated near the front of the snout, where the first pair of teeth from the lower jaw would have been located when the mouth was closed. The palatal portion of the maxilla did not close off the bottom edge of the premaxillae, leaving a large opening —- the incisive foramen —- which was about half as long as the premaxilla was wide. Like its premaxilla, the maxilla of Razanandrongobe was tall and robust. The surface of the palate, which was thickest below the eye sockets, was placed unusually high above the tooth row, at about halfway up the depth of the tooth sockets. At this position, it met the portion of the palate formed by the palatine bones, and bordered the openings known as the suborbital fenestrae. In this way, the palate of Razanandrongobe resembled those of the Ziphosuchia, including Araripesuchus. On the interior of the maxilla, there was a smooth groove, which may have corresponded to a pneumatic opening in the skull that is also seen in the modern Alligator. The inside of the tooth row on the premaxilla and maxilla bore a paradental shelf covered in ridges and furrows. =Lower jaw= Dentary MHNT.PAL.2012.6.1 of Razanandrongobe; splenial attachment marked as asp The lower jaw of Razanandrongobe was also tall and robust. Uniquely, the tip of the lower jaw was devoid of teeth, for a section of the dentary corresponding to the diameter of more than one tooth. The front of the jaw would have been fused; on the inside of the bone, there was a scar running along the rear 20% of the fused portion, representing the attachment of the splenial bone. The tip of the lower jaw would have been strengthened by being upturned at an angle of about 50°. Like the premaxilla, the outer surface of the dentary was textured, bearing a dense network of zigzagging canals for blood vessels (i.e., vascular canals). On the interior surface, immediately adjacent to the tooth row, there was a row of pits, which were enclosed by a groove towards the back of the jaw. The top margin of the bone was convex at the front, followed by a concave region behind it. =Teeth= Razanandrongobe had five teeth in each premaxilla, at least ten in each maxilla, and eight in each half of the dentary. Most of the tooth sockets were sub-circular, although the inner half of the sockets in the maxilla and the front of the dentary were rectangular. All of them were wider than they were long, and were nearly vertical. Larger sockets were separated by narrower distances than smaller teeth, with the separating surfaces being ornamented like the paradental shelves. The teeth themselves are unusual; they bear large serrations on both the front and rear edges, which are proportionally even larger than those of dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus. They were also thick, non-constricted, and slightly recurved (pachydont). Several types of teeth are present, making Razanandrongobe heterodont: the teeth at the front of the jaw were U-shaped (or salinon-shaped) in cross-section, while those on the sides were incisiform (incisor-like) and sub-oval in cross-section, with the smallest teeth at the rear being globe-shaped. The smallest teeth were globe- shaped. None of the teeth were particularly hypertrophied like the canine teeth of mammals (i.e., caniniform), but the first three dentary teeth were larger than the rest. Classification=Archosaurian affinities= upright=1.25 In 2006, Maganuco and colleagues identified Razanandrongobe as a member of the Archosauriformes by its serrated teeth and the thecodont condition of its teeth (i.e. their deep implantation in tooth sockets). Both characteristics are widespread among archosauriforms, and Maganuco and colleagues suggested that the former is a synapomorphy (shared specialization) of the group. They also noted that Razanandrongobe possessed unfused interdental plates covering the inner (lingual) surface of its teeth; they are absent in the non-archosauriform archosauromorphs, present but unfused in several lineages among the Archosauriformes, and fused in some theropod dinosaurs. Maganuco and colleagues suggested that unfused interdental plates are either a synapomorphy of Archosauriformes, or a plesiomorphic (ancestrally present) characteristic of crocodyliforms, theropods, and poposaurids. Considering these characteristics, Maganuco and colleagues placed Razanandrongobe in the Archosauria, but not as part of any basal (early- diverging) lineages due to its heterodont teeth and tall maxilla. While it resembles the Prestosuchidae in the depth and shape of its maxilla, heterodont teeth, paradental shelves, and large size, Maganuco and colleagues considered these traits to have been convergently acquired. Within the Archosauria, they identified two possible positions for Razanandrongobe: Crocodylomorpha and Theropoda, the only lineages of large predatory archosaurs to have survived past the Triassic. However, the original material of Razanandrongobe, consisting of a maxilla and teeth, was too fragmentary to be included in a phylogenetic analysis of archosauriforms, since it lacks nearly all characteristics used in such analyses. Razanandrongobe had globe-shaped teeth like peirosaurids (Hamadasuchus shown), but they lacked \\"necks\\" Among crocodylomorphs, Maganuco and colleagues demonstrated that Razanandrongobe had characteristics intermediate between the basal evolutionary grade \\"Sphenosuchia\\" (which is not a proper clade) and the derived Mesoeucrocodylia: the maxilla would have bordered both the internal choanae (nostril openings, like \\"sphenosuchians\\") and the suborbital fenestrae (like mesoeucrocodylians); the antorbital fenestrae would have had a narrower front margin and were retracted further back on the skull than \\"sphenosuchians\\"; and the paradental shelf was more developed than \\"sphenosuchians\\". Its vertical tooth sockets resembled \\"sphenosuchians\\", baurusuchians, sebecosuchians, and peirosaurids, while the positioning of the palatal depressions and the globe-shaped teeth particularly resembled peirosaurids (though these teeth bear \\"necks\\" in peirosaurids). However, the height of the paradental shelf, the large tooth serrations, the width of the teeth from the side of the jaw, and the relatively flat interdental plates were found to be unusual for crocodylomorphs. Among theropods, Maganuco and colleagues likened the sub- rectangular tooth sockets, roughened interdental plates, low-crowned teeth, and possible broad contact between the maxilla and jugal in Razanandrongobe to the Abelisauridae; however, they noted that the innervated pits (foramina) on its maxilla were distributed more evenly, and that its teeth differed in their cross-sections and the size of their serrations. Meanwhile, the teeth at the front of its jaw resembled the Tyrannosauridae in its shape and cross-section, and the teeth at the sides of the jaw were thickened similarly (or even further), but the serrations on the teeth were larger and lacked a characteristic groove running across them, and its paradental shelf was larger than tyrannosaurids. Finally, while spinosaurids had a well-developed paradental shelf and thickened teeth, the known spinosaurids at the time were all highly specialized, with palatal shelves that formed the \\"roof\\" of the mouth at an acute angle, sub-circular tooth sockets, and teeth that were non- heterodont, high-crowned, and unserrated. The serrations on the teeth of Razanandrongobe have been compared to those of tyrannosaurids (Tyrannosaurus shown) =Resolution as a ziphosuchian= Given the incompleteness of Razanandrongobe, Maganuco and colleagues did not assign Razanandrongobe to a specific group in 2006. Subsequently, the discovery of additional specimens allowed Dal Sasso and colleagues to refine the phylogenetic placement of Razanandrongobe in 2017. The new specimens allowed them to unequivocally identify it as a crocodylomorph and not a theropod, with all similarities having been convergently acquired. Unlike theropods, it has forward-facing and fused bony nostrils that do not contact the maxilla anywhere and are not divided by any bony process; a dentary taller and more robust than any theropod; a splenial which would have been a conspicuous part of the lower jaw, being even visible from the side; a well-developed bony palate on the maxilla; and the previously-noted thickening of the tooth crowns. They also noted another difference from spinosaurids in that the bony nostrils were not retracted up the length of the snout. Within the Crocodylomorpha, Dal Sasso and colleagues confirmed previous observations that the palate of Razanandrongobe differed from \\"sphenosuchians\\", in addition to having a more robust dentary with a shorter toothless portion and a less conspicuous splenial. In particular, the extent of the splenial was probably similar to many other notosuchians, but was not as extreme as the Peirosauridae where the bone contributes to half of the jaw. The fused bony nostrils were most similar in morphology and orientation to the Sphagesauridae; they differed from the Peirosauridae in their complete fusion, and from the Sebecidae in their orientation forwards and not upwards. Its perinarial fossa was a common characteristic among mesoeucrocodylians, and it also lacked a notch in the upper jaw to receive an enlarged lower caniniform tooth; both characteristics were likely plesiomorphic for the group Notosuchia. Razanandrongobe had forward-facing bony nostrils like sphagesaurids (Caipirasuchus shown) In Razanandrongobe, the incisive foramen was larger than most mesoeucrocodylians, while the robust palate on the maxilla was more typical. The upturning of the dentary was most like Baurusuchidae and Kaprosuchus, but Uruguaysuchus and Peirosauridae also had dentaries that tapered upwards in an arch. Unlike Uruguaysuchus, the tooth sockets were not fused. Unlike Aplestosuchus and Sebecus, the teeth were not constricted at the base, nor did the first tooth project forwards. While some baurusuchids and sebecids had serrated teeth, their teeth were flattened, and the serrations were much smaller. No notosuchian had sub-oval teeth like Razanandrongobe, but some sphagesaurids had sub-conical teeth. A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Dal Sasso and colleagues, based on that of Lucas Fiorelli and colleagues in 2016, found that Razanandrongobe was a member of the Ziphosuchia, closely related to Sebecosuchia. The former relation was supported by the lack of constricted tooth crowns and the contact between the dentary and splenial, while the latter was supported by the deep dentary, the similarly-sized and symmetrical serrations, the concavity of the dentary, and a dip in the dentary below the level of the tooth sockets at the middle of the tooth row. Their resulting phylogenetic tree (the majority-rule consensus tree) is partially reproduced below. =Evolutionary context= Little is known about the origins and early evolution of notosuchians, but the fact that they are the sister group of the Neosuchia (which contains all living crocodilians) in the Mesoeucrocodylia implies that they must have first appeared during the Jurassic. Prior to the recognition of Razanandrongobe as a notosuchian, the oldest-known notosuchians were the Aptian-aged (Cretaceous) Anatosuchus, Candidodon, Malawisuchus, and Uruguaysuchus, leaving a ghost lineage of 74 million years between the group's presumed origin and its oldest members. The phylogenetic position of Razanandrongobe in the Notosuchia makes it the oldest-known representative of the group. Razanandrongobe predates all of these notosuchians by 42 million years, partially filling the ghost lineage. Its retention of plesiomorphic characteristics is consistent with its status as an early notosuchian; however, for this reason, Dal Sasso and colleagues noted that its close relation to Sebecosuchia — a much younger lineage, being known from the Santonian forward — must be treated as provisional. Dal Sasso and colleagues supported the notion that notosuchians primarily lived on the continent of Gondwana through their evolutionary history (although the remaining ghost lineage prior to Razanandrongobe precludes inferences about their origins). Palaeobiology Various teeth of Razanandrongobe; wear patterns marked as ws In 2006, Maganuco and colleagues analyzed wear patterns on the surface of Razanandrongobes teeth. For the teeth at the sides of the jaw, most of the wear is present on the outer (lingual) surface of the teeth, on which a U-shaped chip is present on the top third of the crown. There is also a thinner chip on the front (mesial) edge of the tooth, flattening some of the serrations. By contrast, for the teeth at the front of the jaw, the wear is more present on the inner (labial) surface. They inferred that these wear surfaces more strongly resemble those resulting from tooth-food contact than from tooth-tooth contact, with the enamel having flaked off as the animal bit into bones or other hard objects, based on similar observations for tyrannosaurids. Skull anatomy also supports a diet for Razanandrongobe that included hard tissues like bones and tendons. Like tyrannosaurids, the serrations on the teeth of Razanandrongobe were adapted to biting into bone in terms of their size, shape, and also the presence of a rounded depression at the base between neighbouring serrations. In tyrannosaurids, the latter was inferred to have distributed force over the serrations and prevented cracks from spreading, or possibly to have gripped meat fibres. The incisiform teeth of Razanandrongobe also resembles the bone-scraping teeth on the premaxillae of tyrannosaurids, and the teeth at the sides of the jaw were similarly reinforced through thickening (though to an even greater extent). The rest of the skull would have been strengthened by the expansion of the paradental shelves to form a \\"secondary palate\\", which would have greatly increased resistance to vertical bending and torsion, while the fused interdental plates would have protected the teeth from transverse forces. In 2017, Dal Sasso and colleagues suggested that these feeding adaptations — along with a large skull and body size — made Razanandrongobe a highly-specialized terrestrial predator. They inferred that it could have competed with and occupied the ecological niches of theropods in the local ecosystem. Palaeoecology Life reconstruction as a crocodyliform, feeding on upright=1.25 The strata from which Razanandrongobe fossils were recovered has been referred to as the \\"Facies Continental\\" or \\"Bathonien Facies Mixte Dinosauriens\\" (Bathonian mixed dinosaurian facies) of the Sakaraha Formation (or the Isalo IIIb Formation) in the Isalo Group. This geological formation consists of cross-bedded layers of sandstone and siltstone with \\"calcareous paves\\" and multi-coloured claystone banks. The sandstone surrounding the holotype of Razanandrongobe is fine- grained ( in diameter) and is mainly composed of quartz, with rarer grains of ilmenite, garnet, and zircon. The depositional environment has been inferred to be fluvial (river-based) or lacustrine (lake-based). Based on the sea urchins Nucleolites amplus and Acrosalenia colcanapi as index fossils, the Sakaraha Formation has been correlated to the Bathonian stage (167.7–164.7 million years ago) of the Middle Jurassic epoch. Middle Jurassic deposits in the Mahajanga Basin have produced an unusual but poorly-known assemblage of animals. In 2005, the other skull fragment found in the same locality as Razanandrongobe was named as the sauropod dinosaur Archaeodontosaurus. Teeth of pterosaurs were also found at the locality. Animals from other localities include the sauropods Lapparentosaurus and \\"Bothriospondylus\\" madagascariensis, and another sauropod based on teeth; theropods of the groups Abelisauridae, basal Ceratosauria, Coelurosauria, and possibly Tetanurae, along with tracks of the ichnogenus Kayentapus; thalattosuchian crocodyliforms; a mammal belonging to the Tribosphenida; plesiosaurs; and possibly ichthyosaurs. Silicified wood is also present in the strata.

He stayed with Radio 2 until 1970. His broadcasting career began in the late 1950s on the British Forces Network during his service in the Royal Air Force in Germany. He was stationed at RAF Wahn which was fairly close to the British Forces Network studios in Cologne.Alan Grace, THIS IS THE BRITISH FORCES NETWORK, pg. 112 Hollingdale had presented a show on CNBC in 1962, and may have been Britain's first ever pirate radio disc jockey. He joined the Presentation team at the BBC, on the BBC Light Programme in 1964, introducing concerts and gramophone record shows as well as reading news bulletins. Hollingdale announced the death of Sir Winston Churchill on 24 January 1965. Hollingdale was also the first presenter on Radio 210 in Reading, launching the station in 1976 with The Breakfast Show, which ran from 6.00 am to 10.00 am. For a spell, he also presented an evening show, between 9.00pm and midnight two days a week, giving him just six hours from the finish of one show to the start of the next. He returned to BBC Radio 2 for a special show to mark the 40th anniversary of the station on 30 September 2007. In 1979, he opened Blue Danube Radio, an English language station in Vienna, Austria, and contributed to the station until it closed in 2000.

These facilities, in particular the airfields and naval bases, played a key role in the defense of Alaska, and in military operations against Japanese forces which occupied Attu and Kiska, two remote islands in the Aleutian chain. The Sitka facilities were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. Description and history In consideration of the possibility of war in the Pacific Ocean, the United States War Department in 1937 established a small naval station near Sitka, Alaska as a base for a small fleet of PBY Catalina seaplanes. In 1939 Congress appropriate funds for the construction of naval air stations at Sitka and other sites in coastal Alaska. The Sitka station was built on Japonski Island, just west of Sitka Harbor, on land that had been under United States Navy jurisdiction since the Alaska Purchase in 1867. The Sitka Naval Air Station was formally commissioned on October 1, 1939. What was then not much more than a coal resupply station rapidly grew, with a radio station, barracks, and other facilities constructed, mainly on the north side of the island. In March 1941 United States Army forces arrived in Sitka, and began construction of a coastal defense battery on Makhnati Island, an islet at the western end of a chain of islets extending westward from Japonski Island. To facilitate this work, a causeway in length was constructed connecting Japonski to Mahknati via this island chain. These facilities were the only significant American military facilities in the North Pacific when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, even though they were still a work in progress. The naval facilities on Japonski Island eventually grew to include several hangars, ramps into the water to facilitate the movement of seaplanes onto land, a large concrete parking area, a control tower, two piers, and a number of ancillary support buildings. On the island the Navy also had a system for landing and launching aircraft similar to that used on aircraft carriers, but none of these facilities have survived. Along the causeway to Makhnati Island, a number of facilities were built for the Army coastal defense units. The major facility, Fort Rousseau, was on Makhnati, and housed two six-inch guns, two 155mm guns, magazines, and the army command post. A secondary battery was placed on Sasedni Island, where there were also barracks and a mess hall, and Virublennoi Island housed three ammunition bunkers. The batteries were not completed until after the Japanese had been driven from Attu and Kiska, and saw no action. The army closed its base at Sitka in spring 1944, and are now little more than foundations and concrete structures. The surviving elements of the Sitka Naval Operating Base, the causeway to Makhnati Island, and the coastal defense station were designated a National Historic Landmark on August 11, 1986. and See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Alaska *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sitka City and Borough, Alaska References Category:National Historic Landmarks in Alaska Category:Buildings and structures in Sitka, Alaska Category:Military facilities on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Category:World War II sites in the United States Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Sitka, Alaska Category:World War II on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska ","title":"Sitka Naval Operating Base and U.S. Army Coastal Defenses"},{"id":"15107340","text":"In Chinese astronomy, a guest star () is a star which has suddenly appeared in a place where no star had previously been observed and becomes invisible again after some time. The term is a literal translation from ancient Chinese astronomical records. Modern astronomy recognizes that guest stars are manifestations of cataclysmic variable stars: novae and supernovae. The term \\"guest star\\" is used in the context of ancient records, since the exact classification of an astronomical event in question is based on interpretations of old records, including inference, rather than on direct observations. In ancient Chinese astronomy, guest stars were one of the three types of highly transient objects (bright heavenly bodies). The other two were comets with tails () and comets without tails (), with the former term being used for all comets in modern astronomy. The earliest Chinese record of guest stars is contained in Han Shu (漢書), the history of Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), and all subsequent dynastic histories had such records.Zhentao Xu, David W. Pankenier (2000) \\"East-Asian Archaeoastronomy: Historical Records of Astronomical Observations of China, Japan, and Korea\\", , Chapter 6, \\"Guest Stars\\" These contain one of the clearest early descriptions consistent with a supernova, posited to be left over by object SN 185, thus identified as a supernova remnant of the exact year 185 CE. Chronicles of the contemporary Ancient Europeans are more vague when consulted for supernovae candidates. Whether due to weather or other reasons for lack of observation, astronomers have questioned why the notable remnant attributed to Chinese observations of a guest star in 1054 CE (see SN 1054), is missing from the European records.

Upon E.J.'s death in 1909, his daughter Anita closed the cottage and disposed of all furnishings. Some of the architectural elements of the cottage, such as the stained glass windows, black walnut doors, and marble fireplace mantels were stored in the coach barn. The stored items were reinstalled in the cottage during the 1951-1953 restoration. The cottage has been used for numerous films and television shows, most famously for the opening of Fantasy Island where the character of Tattoo can be seen ringing the bell in the cottage's tower and Mr. Roarke is seen exiting from it. thumb In 1993 the \\"X\\"-pattern fencing around the Queen Anne Cottage was refurbished and repaired as part of an Eagle Scout project by Erik Wanson, a member of Boy Scout Troop 351 in San Marino, California.

Plot Michiko Akiyama (Kinuyo Tanaka) is married to Tadao Akiyama (Masayuki Mori), a college professor but a vulgar man with a low-class background. Towards the end of World War II, they flee the Bombing of Tokyo to her parents' estate in the suburban Musashino. When her parents die, Michiko inherits the estate. Nearby is her cousin, Eiji Ono (So Yamamura), a wartime profiteer with loose morals, and his wife Tomiko (Yukiko Todoroki). After the end of the war, the extended family is joined by the young and handsome Tsutomu Miyaji (Akihito Katayama), another cousin of hers and former prisoner- of-war. In the immediate post-war era, Japanese traditions and morals decline. Tadao comes home drunk every night and has sexual relationships with students. He also propositions Tomiko. However, Tomiko, unhappy in her marriage, also lusts after Tsutomu. Michiko also has mutual feelings for Tsutomu but resists his advances because she is a married woman and because she does not want him to fall prey to permissiveness.

The only thing that remains constant is her enjoyment of a restaurant called the Girl on the Red Swing, where each menu item is served on a waffle. Restaurant owner Kate Bowzer takes Primrose under her wing. She teaches her how to cook (recipes are all cited in a notepad). She doesn't question or criticize her, even through her odd predicaments, such as accidentally setting the class guinea pig on fire. Primrose is taken from the custody of her uncle Jack after a series of accidents, including losing a toe and part of her finger. Uncle Jack is said to be fighting \\"tooth and nail\\" for custody of her. As a foster kid, she is put into the home of an older couple, Evie and Bert. Although, they are all fond of each other, Primrose does not seem able to develop an attachment to them, likely because of her history of unstable living. While in foster care, the mental state of Primrose's former guardian, Miss Perfidy, quickly deteriorates. While Primrose is visiting her in the hospital, Miss Perfidy dies, but Primrose does not exhibit much of a reaction. Through her oddities and accidents, Primrose becomes a town curiosity, with neighbors questioning her emotional state. But even through all of this, Primrose never gives up hope in finding her parents and being a normal family again. Primrose is eventually returned to her uncle, but remains in contact with Bert and Evie, as they see her as a granddaughter figure. Later on, her parents come back, which is a real shock to everyone in town. Uncle Jack faints upon seeing them alive, and Primrose embraces her parents. They reveal that the storm had washed them up on a shore, where they had survived until they flagged down a passing-by ship. Throughout her unstable life, Primrose remains rock solid in her belief that her parents will return. She gathers many stories from many people regarding times when they have \\"just known\\" something was true, even though they mightn't have had proof.

A six-wheeled tank / utility vehicle, it appears in the original Mass Effect as a drivable transport vehicle which is also capable of providing combat support. The Mako was originally intended for inclusion in Mass Effect: Andromeda, though a similar vehicle known as the ND-1 Nomad was featured instead. The Mako was widely criticized for being awkward to control in the game's vehicle sections, which was also described as lacking in meaningful content, leading to its removal as a drivable vehicle from later titles due to the substantial negative feedback. However, retrospective opinions of the vehicle have recognized it as an iconic aspect of the series in spite of its gameplay flaws.  Development  Multiple concepts were considered for the Mako early in development, including a rover, a tank, and a scout vehicle.A hovering feature was included in some concepts, which is later utilized for the M-44 Hammerhead, an optional purchased add-on for Mass Effect 2 which is only used for linear, specific missions. The Mako's final design references a modern armored personal carrier with a darkened, armored-glass front and six wheels. Casey Hudson, director of the original Mass Effect trilogy, acknowledged that the Mako was inspired by the BIG TRAK / bigtrak, a programmable electric toy vehicle envisioned for use on the moon or a planetoid style environment. Bioware announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2014 the Mako vehicle would return in the next installment in the series due to its exploration emphasis. The panel team indicated that the Mako would be customizable and that they wanted to make it fun to play: it will now be more agile and takes advantage of the newer open spaces, though it no longer have an attached cannon. BioWare's Mike Gamble explained that, \\"We're playing around with a bunch of different physics for the Mako. The thing that we have to do is make sure it is as responsive as possible. We've learned a thing or two over the years.\\" Aaron Flynn noted that the development team for the Need for Speed was consulted for guidance and advice to improve the vehicle's gameplay experience, and claimed that Andromeda's iteration of the Mako does not have the multiple edge cases from the first game \\"where you could do crazy stuff with it\\", and that it should be a high quality experience that compares well to any driving simulation video game. In an interview with Polygon, lead writer for Andromeda Mac Walters said that it was a non-controversial choice internally to bring back the Mako as Andromeda is heavy on planetary exploration which is appropriate for the vehicle's role, in spite of its notoriety with fans and critics. The ND-1 Nomad, considered to be the successor to the Mako, appears in Andromeda and is integrated with multiple quality of life features the Mako lacked. Depiction The Mako's compact size and light weight allow it to fit in the small cargo bays of scouting frigates commissioned by the Systems Alliance. It is equipped with micro- thrusters, and a small element zero core which can be used to reduce or increase mass, allowing the Mako to be safely air-dropped to virtually any world. This allows frigates to deploy their shore parties while limiting the ship's exposure to defensive anti-aircraft artillery. When used in conjunction with thrusters, mass reduction allows the Mako to extricate itself from difficult terrain. In low gravity environments, the core can be used to increase mass and provide greater traction. Several combat support vehicles using the Mako's basic chassis are also manufactured for Alliance surface garrisons. The Mako is environmentally sealed and powered by a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell to support Alliance military personnel who may find themselves fighting in a variety of planetary environments. The Mako possesses a ground- penetrating radar which allows detection of anti-vehicle mines and other subsurface anomalies, and its hull is covered with laser detection arrays which forewarn the crew of enemy laser-guided ordnance through the vehicle's micro-frame computer system. In Mass Effect 2, the Mako can be found largely intact at the crash site of the destroyed SSV Normandy on the surface of Alchera, which demonstrates the vehicle's resilience and prompts a flashback by Commander Shepard of it parked inside the Normandy's cargo bay. Numerous Mako vehicles are deployed during the final battle for Earth in Mass Effect 3, and form the bulk of the Alliance mobile armor under Hammer Team. Several Mako vehicles is seen attempting to outrun Harbinger's attacks at the push toward the London Conduit, though one directly sidelines Shepard's squadmates after tumbling on their path, forcing Shepard to proceed alone. =In other media= The Mako appears in the animated film Mass Effect: Paragon Lost. The interior of the vehicle is depicted for the first time in the Mass Effect media franchise, which is spacious enough to comfortably accommodate eight passengers. In 2013, a fan constructed a 19.5\\" long and 8\\" tall replica of the Mako out of craft foam, a wooden dowel, and superglue. The base was salvaged from a 6-wheel RC truck from Target, and the body is patterned after a papercraft model designed by another fan. Its attached turret rotates on command via a remote control. Reception Overall critical reception of the Mako has been mixed. Some critics appreciated its exploration aspects, particularly in retrospective reviews, and considered it an iconic part of the Mass Effect series others described driving the vehicle as a clunky and frustrating experience. Mike Hoffman from The Escapist considered the Mako to be \\"the most divisive vehicle in video game history\\". Marty Sliva from IGN observed that the Mako was \\"infamous\\", and a \\"source of contention amongst fans of the original Mass Effect, partially due to the vehicle's wonky physics\\". In his review of the PC version of Mass Effect Kieron Gillen from Eurogamer called the Mako \\"adorably rubbish\\" and made fun of its \\"attack truck\\" design. Dan Ryckert from Game Informer said that the Mako \\"handles like an ambulance with beach balls for wheels\\", and that the vehicle sections \\"stuck out like a sore thumb\\" in an otherwise highly regarded role-playing game. Besides her criticism of the Mako's control mechanics, Carolyn Gudmundson from GamesRadar also complained that the vehicle's shields took overly long to recharge, even with squadmates possessing high tech scores as its passengers. Brenna Hillier from VG247 commented that \\"ticking every side content box in Mass Effect required a lot of Mako time, and feedback was negative enough that BioWare mostly dropped ground vehicles for the two later games\\". In a 2010 article, IGN staff argued that BioWare's decision to remove the Mako and all vehicle exploratory elements from Mass Effect 2 was an overreaction, as they felt that the vehicle's technical issues could have been addressed and refined, noting that \\"vehicles are often a welcome feature in games that revolve around on-foot combat. They offer a variation in combat pacing and speed up exploration that would otherwise be impossible on foot\\" and that the Mako or a similar vehicle should return for Mass Effect 3. Matt Boyd from GamesRadar emphasized the Mako's significance as that \\"even the initial teaser trailer closed with Shepard dropping the Mako into Geth- infested territory\\"; he acknowledged that the Hammerhead's hovering capabilities as \\"merciful\\" compared to the Mako's flawed mechanics, but he disliked the lack of exploration the player can perform with the Hammerhead as well as its weak defenses. Rowan Kaiser from Kotaku praised the Mako sections for giving the story sections of Mass Effect a \\"sense of speed\\" that later games lacked, as well as illustrating the size of the universe. Hayley Williams, also from Kotaku, recalled that the Mako was an \\"awkward, necessary game feature that became part joke, part legend\\"; while she argued that \\"anyone who managed to complete the drive up to Peak 15 without driving off the edge multiple times deserves a medal\\" due to its controls and questionable physics, Williams noted that \\"a lot of players missed the freedom that it offered\\" and that it was at least situationally useful in open world combat situations. BioWare's announcement that an improved version of the Mako would return as a drivable vehicle in Andromeda was well received. Steve Hannley from Hardcore Gaming welcomed the announcement and called the Mako a \\"fan- favorite\\". After playing the demo for Andromeda where she took control of the Nomad within the time span of half an hour, Williams observed that the Mako and the Nomad are \\"fairly similar in both design and function\\", and that it was easier and more fun to drive.

Performance surfaces are normally laid on top of, or are part of, a sprung floor to produce a complete dance floor or sports floor. Dance performance surfaces made of sheet vinyl are also called dance floors and marley floors. They are called marley-type floors from a very popular reversible vinyl flooring manufactured for years until about 1978 by Marley Floors Ltd.Entertainment Flooring Systems Frequently Asked Questions Theatres often have a number of roll-out floors with different characteristics to satisfy the requirements of different forms of dance. This article deals mainly with the customization of a floor for different activities by the use of different surfaces. The sprung floor article deals with the basic requirements and construction of floors to make them suitable for dance and indoor sports.  Requirements  The sprung floor article outlines some of the different standards with regards to the performance surface of a sports floor. Below are some of the key factors that can influence the performance surface required within a sports facility.Dynamik Sports Academy Floor * Shock absorption: The amount of an impact that is absorbed by the floor (Usually measured in %) * Vertical deformation: The average distance the floor deforms under impact (Usually measured in mm) * Rolling load: If the floor can withstand a weighted trolley being wheeled across the surface (A set weight is defined and the outcome is usually yes/no or pass/fail) * Ball rebound: How much a ball bounces off the surface compared to what it would when being bounced on a concrete surface (Measured as a % against the bounce on a concrete surface) * Slip resistance: The level of grip the surface has (Measurements vary depending on standards) A sprung floor with a hard surface provides protection from serious injuries rather than minor injuries. A fall can still cause bruises. A soft performance surface on the other hand can provide protection from minor injuries but not serious injuries. Providing sufficient protection from serious injury for adults using a thick performance surface alone would render it unsuitable for most dance or sport. This is because a performance surface is point elastic whereas area elasticity as provided by a sprung floor is mainly preferred.  Traction  In general, dance requires less traction than gym. However a floor should not of itself be very slippery or sticky. DIN 18032 defines a range of traction which should suit most activities. These type of floors should also be smooth, and a slide should not cause carpet burn. This means it is difficult to stop them from becoming slippery when wet.UK Slip resistance group FAQ Most of the differences between the different disciplines can and should be catered for by the use of appropriate shoes. On the same surface, a dance shoe with a leather or suede sole will give much less traction than a gym shoe with a composite rubber sole. A sticky floor used for gym is very likely to cause twisted ankles, and a slippery floor used for dancing is liable to cause bad falls. Everyday footwear nowadays tends to have a higher traction. For occasions like weddings, where the dancers may not have proper footwear, a slightly slippier floor could compensate somewhat, but a highly polished floor can be very dangerous with leather soles. Both gyms and dance clubs are better off providing good safe floors and encouraging the use of proper footwear.  Performance surface construction  The performance surface is normally of vinyl or hardwood, engineered wood or laminate. For dance the surface may be replaceable so for instance a theatre can adapt easily to either ballet or tap dance, these are normally made of vinyl sheeting. Hardwood is however preferred for tap dance. Some sports have extra requirements like spike resistance or a standard ball bounce. Roll-up vinyl sheeting normally consists of: * A thin top wear layer that also has UV light protection. Ultraviolet light rapidly degrades vinyl. This layer has to provide the proper traction and tends to be matte rather than shiny as for domestic vinyl. * A layer of vinyl which supports the wear layer. This also provides the main colour. * A woven fibre interlayer. This stops the floor deforming and also provides some area elasticity. * A bottom layer of foamed vinyl which provides the softness. When rolled up the vinyl should not be bent sharply - it should be on rolls. When there are a number of different surfaces for a hall these can be kept on special storage carts which keep them separate rather than lying on each other.  What makes a good performance surface  A wood surface is ideal for social dancing if maintained properly and is also standard for many indoor sports. Engineered wood is normally used nowadays for wood flooring as it is less liable to warp or shrink and is more economic. Tap dance is especially punishing and a tough hardwood surface like oak or maple is preferred for any regular use. Vinyl is a better choice for other types of dance or more general community use. The requirements for different types of dance are different, but the differences can mostly be accommodated by changes in the dance surface. For instance Riverdance requires a harder surface that makes a sound, Ballet requires a softer surface because of the high jumps and possibility of falls. Ballroom dancing requires less traction than Scottish country dancing. It used to be difficult to maintain a wood floor properly. However, if the directions of the floor manufacturer are followed properly modern treatments will maintain a good surface.Bona Sportive System A wood floor maintenance system supporting DIN 18032:2 It is important not to just trust a commercial office cleaner to know how to do a good job, they should be instructed to follow the directions. There are no cheap and foolproof machines around for measuring traction which would enable cleaners to see their work conforms to dance or sports requirements.Assessing the slip resistance of flooring Ten Myths Concerning Slip-Resistance Measurement Thus there is a very strong inclination for managers or cleaners to go for other requirements e.g. a shiny surface or one that resists dirt better. If a floor is occasionally used for public events, e.g. a gym hall used for a graduation ceremony, then a gym floor cover can be used to protect the floor and ease the normal requirements. To maintain good traction it is important to stop the floor getting dirty or even slightly wet. A good floor cleaning regime and insisting on sports or dance shoes will help with this. The main protection though is to ensure the hall has industrial grade barrier matting at the entrance. The building should also have a floor grate at the entrance.

Over the succeeding four years, elements of the Berlin Brigade were either reassigned or deactivated. In the four years between the inactivation of the air group at Berlin Tempelhof Airport and fall 1994, 31 installations were closed, including the Andrews and McNair barracks, the American military hospital, and the General Lucius D.

Friedrich Wilhelm Weber (25 December 1813 - 5 April 1894) was a German doctor, politician of the Prussian House of Deputies, and poet. Weber was born in Alshausen, near Bad Driburg, in Westphalia. His father was forester for the Count of Asseburg. Weber first attended the village school, then when thirteen years old he went to the Gymnasium at Paderborn, and afterwards studied medicine at the University of Greifswald. His talent for poetry had been evidenced at the gymnasium; at university, it grew. After spending two years at Greifswald he went to Breslau, where he became acquainted with Gustav Freitag. After a year, however, he returned to Greifswald, where he obtained a doctorate; thence he went to Berlin, where he passed the state medical examination with great honour. After a brief journey for recreation to southern Germany he settled as a physician in Driburg, where he spent twenty-six years. His practice as a doctor did not keep him from writing poetry. In 1887 he settled permanently at Nieheim. In 1863 he was made Sanitätsrat (honorary title given to a distinguished doctor) in recognition of his medical services; he was made an honorary doctor of philosophy by the academy in Munich, and when he celebrated his semi-centennial as a physician he received the Order of the Red Eagle, fourth class, while three years before his death he received the further honour of the title of Geheimen Sanitätsrat. He was elected a member of the Prussian House of Deputies. He remained a member of the Centre Party until 1893, when he declined a re-election on account of his health. His poetry fell into the genres of epic, lyric, and didactic. His early poems were frequently imitations of foreign poets. He was also one of the translators who made Scandinavian and English poetry accessible to Germans, including Tennyson's Enoch Arden, Aylmers Field and Maud, and Esaias Tegnér's Axel. His reputation, however, was founded on his epic, Dreizehnlinden (1878). It enjoyed a wide circulation, and was arranged for the stage; he was nicknamed 'Dreizehnlinden-Weber' after it. His second work is his Goliath (1892). His Gedichte(1881) and Herbstblätter (1895) were published after his death. Other works include Marienblumen (1885), and two other religious poems written for special occasions, Vater unser and Das Leiden unseres Heilandes (1892).

The attack happened near Aleg, 250 km east of the capital Nouakchott. The victims, five French tourists on holiday, were attacked while they were having a picnic. Four of them were killed and the fifth was seriously injured. There was one survivor; the victims were his two adult sons, brother, and a friend. The 2008 Dakar Rally was moved to central Europe (known as the Central Europe Rally when held in April) because of this incident due to concerns of a possible terrorist attack. Mauritanian authorities arrested nine people on January 7, 2008. An assault rifle was recovered by police from a location close to the scene of the killings. The Mauritanian interior minister blamed a terrorist sleeper cell for the killings. Authorities say suspects are members of an extremist group linked to al-Qaida. One of the suspects arrested in January, Sidi Ould Sidna, escaped from the police in March but was arrested again in April. Sidna had trained with the group Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, which confirmed Sidna was affiliated with their organization. In 2010, three men who claimed to be \\"soldiers of Al-Qaeda\\", Sidi Ould Sidna, Mohamed Ould Chabarnou, and Maarouf Ould Haiba, were sentenced to death by a Mauritanian court for the attack. Since Mauritania has not used the death penalty since the 1980s, their death sentence will likely be commuted to an extended prison sentence on appeal.

S. Eliot, widely regarded as one of the most important poems of the 20th century and a central work of modernist poetry. Published in 1922, the 434-line poem first appeared in the United Kingdom in the October issue of Eliot's The Criterion and in the United States in the November issue of The Dial. It was published in book form in December 1922. Among its famous phrases are \\"April is the cruellest month\\", \\"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\\", and the mantra in the Sanskrit language \\"Shantih shantih shantih\\". Eliot's poem combines the legend of the Holy Grail and the Fisher King with vignettes of contemporary British society. Eliot employs many literary and cultural allusions from the Western canon, Buddhism and the Hindu Upanishads. The poem shifts between voices of satire and prophecy featuring abrupt and unannounced changes of speaker, location, and time and conjuring a vast and dissonant range of cultures and literatures. The poem is divided into five sections. The first, \\"The Burial of the Dead,\\" introduces the diverse themes of disillusionment and despair. The second, \\"A Game of Chess,\\" employs alternating narrations, in which vignettes of several characters address those themes experientially. \\"The Fire Sermon,\\" the third section, offers a philosophical meditation in relation to the imagery of death and views of self-denial in juxtaposition influenced by Augustine of Hippo and eastern religions. After a fourth section, \\"Death by Water,\\" which includes a brief lyrical petition, the culminating fifth section, \\"What the Thunder Said,\\" concludes with an image of judgment. Composition history=Writing= Eliot probably worked on the text that became The Waste Land for several years preceding its first publication in 1922. In a May 1921 letter to New York lawyer and patron of modernism John Quinn, Eliot wrote that he had \\"a long poem in mind and partly on paper which I am wishful to finish\\".Eliot 1988, p. 451 Richard Aldington, in his memoirs, relates that \\"a year or so\\" before Eliot read him the manuscript draft of The Waste Land in London, Eliot visited him in the country. While walking through a graveyard, they discussed Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard. Aldington writes: \\"I was surprised to find that Eliot admired something so popular, and then went on to say that if a contemporary poet, conscious of his limitations as Gray evidently was, would concentrate all his gifts on one such poem he might achieve a similar success.\\" Eliot, having been diagnosed with some form of nervous disorder, had been recommended rest, and applied for three months' leave from the bank where he was employed; the reason stated on his staff card was \\"nervous breakdown\\". He and his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, travelled to the coastal resort of Margate, Kent, for a period of convalescence. While there, Eliot worked on the poem, and possibly showed an early version to Ezra Pound when the Eliots travelled to Paris in November 1921 and stayed with him. Eliot was en route to Lausanne, Switzerland, for treatment by Doctor Roger Vittoz, who had been recommended to him by Ottoline Morrell; Vivienne was to stay at a sanatorium just outside Paris. In Hotel Ste. Luce (where Hotel Elite has stood since 1938) in Lausanne, Eliot produced a 19-page version of the poem. He returned from Lausanne in early January 1922. Pound then made detailed editorial comments and significant cuts to the manuscript. Eliot later dedicated the poem to Pound. =Manuscript drafts= Eliot sent the manuscript drafts of the poem to John Quinn in October 1922; they reached Quinn in New York in January 1923. Upon Quinn's death in 1924 they were inherited by his sister Julia Anderson. Years later, in the early 1950s, Mrs Anderson's daughter Mary Conroy found the documents in storage. In 1958 she sold them privately to the New York Public Library. It was not until April 1968, three years after Eliot's death, that the existence and whereabouts of the manuscript drafts were made known to Valerie Eliot, the poet's second wife and widow. In 1971, Faber and Faber published a \\"facsimile and transcript\\" of the original drafts, edited and annotated by Valerie Eliot. The full poem prior to the Pound editorial changes is contained in the facsimile. =Editing= The drafts of the poem reveal that it originally contained almost twice as much material as the final published version. The significant cuts are in part due to Ezra Pound's suggested changes, although Eliot himself also removed large sections. The now famous opening lines of the poem—\\"April is the cruellest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land\\"—did not originally appear until the top of the second page of the typescript. The first page of the typescript contained 54 lines in the sort of street voice that we hear again at the end of the second section, A Game of Chess. This page appears to have been lightly crossed out in pencil by Eliot himself. Although there are several signs of similar adjustments made by Eliot, and a number of significant comments by Vivienne, the most significant editorial input is clearly that of Pound, who recommended many cuts to the poem. 'The typist home at teatime' section was originally in entirely regular stanzas of iambic pentameter, with a rhyme scheme of abab—the same form as Gray's Elegy, which was in Eliot's thoughts around this time. Pound's note against this section of the draft is \\"verse not interesting enough as verse to warrant so much of it\\". In the end, the regularity of the four-line stanzas was abandoned. At the beginning of 'The Fire Sermon' in one version, there was a lengthy section in heroic couplets, in imitation of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. It described one lady Fresca (who appeared in the earlier poem \\"Gerontion\\"). Richard Ellmann said \\"Instead of making her toilet like Pope's Belinda, Fresca is going to it, like Joyce's Bloom.\\" The lines read: Ellmann notes: \\"Pound warned Eliot that since Pope had done the couplets better, and Joyce the defecation, there was no point in another round.\\" Pound also excised some shorter poems that Eliot wanted to insert between the five sections. One of these, that Eliot had entitled 'Dirge', begins At the request of Eliot's wife Vivienne, a line in the A Game of Chess section was removed from the poem: \\"And we shall play a game of chess/The ivory men make company between us / Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door\\". This section is apparently based on their marital life, and she may have felt these lines too revealing. However, the \\"ivory men\\" line may have meant something to Eliot: in 1960, thirteen years after Vivienne's death, he inserted the line in a copy made for sale to aid the London Library, of which he was President at the time; it fetched £2,800. Rupert Hart-Davis had requested the original manuscript for the auction, but Eliot had lost it long ago (though it was found in America years later). In a late December 1921 letter to Eliot to celebrate the \\"birth\\" of the poem, Pound wrote a bawdy poem of 48 lines entitled \\"Sage Homme\\" in which he identified Eliot as the mother of the poem but compared himself to the midwife.Eliot 1988, p. 498 The first lines are: Publishing history Before the editing had even begun, Eliot found a publisher. Horace Liveright of the New York publishing firm of Boni and Liveright was in Paris for a number of meetings with Ezra Pound. At a dinner on 3 January 1922 (see 1922 in poetry), he made offers for works by Pound, James Joyce (Ulysses) and Eliot. Eliot was to get a royalty of 15% for a book version of the poem planned for autumn publication.Book royalty deal: Rainey, p. 77 To maximise his income and reach a broader audience, Eliot also sought a deal with magazines. Being the London correspondent for The Dial magazineT. S. Eliot's \\"London Letters\\" to The Dial, viewed 28 February 2008. and a college friend of its co-owner and co-editor, Scofield Thayer, The Dial was an ideal choice. Even though The Dial offered $150 (£34)1922 US dollars per British pound exchange rate: Officer for the poem (25% more than its standard rate) Eliot was offended that a year's work would be valued so low, especially since another contributor was found to have been given exceptional compensation for a short story.The Dials initial offer: Rainey, p. 78. The deal with The Dial almost fell through (other magazines considered were the Little Review and Vanity Fair), but with Pound's efforts eventually a deal was worked out where, in addition to the $150, Eliot would be awarded The Dials second annual prize for outstanding service to letters. The prize carried an award of $2,000 (£450).The Dial magazine's announcement of award to Eliot, viewed 28 February 2008 In New York in the late summer (with John Quinn, a lawyer and literary patron, representing Eliot's interests) Boni and Liveright made an agreement with The Dial allowing the magazine to be the first to publish the poem in the US if they agreed to purchase 350 copies of the book at discount from Boni and Liveright.Dial purchasing books: Rainey, p. 86. Rainey adds that this increased the cost to The Dial by $315. Boni and Liveright would use the publicity of the award of The Dial's prize to Eliot to increase their initial sales. The poem was first published in the UK, without the author's notes, in the first issue (October 1922) of The Criterion, a literary magazine started and edited by Eliot. The first appearance of the poem in the US was in the November 1922 issue of The Dial magazine (actually published in late October). In December 1922, the poem was published in the US in book form by Boni and Liveright, the first publication to print the notes. In September 1923, the Hogarth Press, a private press run by Eliot's friends Leonard and Virginia Woolf, published the first UK book edition of The Waste Land in an edition of about 450 copies, the type handset by Virginia Woolf. The publication history of The Waste Land (as well as other pieces of Eliot's poetry and prose) has been documented by Donald Gallup. Eliot, whose 1922 annual salary at Lloyds Bank was £500 ($2,215)Eliot's 1922 salary: Gordon 2000 p. 165 made approximately £630 ($2,800) with The Dial, Boni and Liveright, and Hogarth Press publications.Total income from poem: Rainey, p. 100 Title Eliot originally considered entitling the poem He do the Police in Different Voices. In the version of the poem Eliot brought back from Switzerland, the first two sections of the poem—'The Burial of the Dead' and 'A Game of Chess'—appeared under this title. This strange phrase is taken from Charles Dickens' novel Our Mutual Friend, in which the widow Betty Higden says of her adopted foundling son Sloppy, \\"You mightn't think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper. He do the Police in different voices.\\" Some critics use this working title to support the theory that, while there are many different voices (speakers) in the poem, there is only one central consciousness. What was lost by the rejection of this title Eliot might have felt compelled to restore by commenting on the commonalities of his characters in his note about Tiresias, stating that 'What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem.' In the end, the title Eliot chose was The Waste Land. In his first note to the poem he attributes the title to Jessie L. Weston's book on the Grail legend, From Ritual to Romance. The allusion is to the wounding of the Fisher King and the subsequent sterility of his lands; to restore the King and make his lands fertile again, the Grail questor must ask, \\"What ails you?\\" A poem strikingly similar in theme and language called \\"Waste Land,\\" written by Madison Cawein, was published in 1913 in Poetry. The poem's title is often mistakenly given as \\"Waste Land\\" (as used by Weston) or \\"Wasteland\\", omitting the definite article. However, in a letter to Ezra Pound, Eliot politely insisted that the title was three words beginning with \\"The\\".Eliot 1988 p. 567. Structure The epigraph and dedication to The Waste Land showing some of the languages that Eliot used in the poem: Latin, Greek, English and Italian. The poem is preceded by a Latin and Greek epigraph from The Satyricon of Petronius: > 'Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et > cum illi pueri dicerent: Σίβυλλα τί ϴέλεις; respondebat illa: άπο ϴανεΐν > ϴέλω.' In English, it reads: \\"For once I myself saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a cage, and when the boys said, Sibyl, what do you want? she replied I want to die.\\" Following the epigraph is a dedication (added in a 1925 republication) that reads \\"For Ezra Pound: il miglior fabbro\\". Here Eliot is both quoting line 117 of Canto XXVI of Dante's Purgatorio, the second cantica of the Divine Comedy, where Dante defines the troubadour Arnaut Daniel as \\"the best smith of the mother tongue\\", and also Pound's title of chapter 2 of his The Spirit of Romance (1910) where he translated the phrase as \\"the better craftsman\\". This dedication was originally written in ink by Eliot in the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition of the poem presented to Pound; it was subsequently included in future editions.Wilhelm 1990 p. 309 The five parts of The Waste Land are entitled: #The Burial of the Dead #A Game of Chess #The Fire Sermon #Death by Water #What the Thunder Said The text of the poem is followed by several pages of notes, purporting to explain his metaphors, references, and allusions. Some of these notes are helpful in interpreting the poem, but some are arguably even more puzzling, and many of the most opaque passages are left unannotated. The notes were added after Eliot's publisher requested something longer to justify printing The Waste Land in a separate book. Thirty years after publishing the poem with these notes, Eliot expressed his regret at \\"having sent so many enquirers off on a wild goose chase after Tarot cards and the Holy Grail\\".Wild goose chase: There is some question as to whether Eliot originally intended The Waste Land to be a collection of individual poems (additional poems were supplied to Pound for his comments on including them) or to be considered one poem with five sections. The structure of the poem is also meant to loosely follow the vegetation myth and Holy Grail folklore surrounding the Fisher King story as outlined by Jessie Weston in her book From Ritual to Romance (1920). Weston's book was so central to the structure of the poem that it was the first text that Eliot cited in his \\"Notes on the Waste Land\\". Style The style of the poem is marked by the hundreds of allusions and quotations from other texts (classic and obscure; \\"highbrow\\" and \\"lowbrow\\") that Eliot peppered throughout the poem. In addition to the many \\"highbrow\\" references and quotes from poets like Baudelaire, Shakespeare, Ovid, and Homer, as well as Wagner's libretti, Eliot also included several references to \\"lowbrow\\" genres. A good example of this is Eliot's quote from the 1912 popular song \\"The Shakespearian Rag\\" by lyricists Herman Ruby and Gene Buck.North, Michael. The Waste Land: Authoritative Text, Contexts, Criticism. New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 2001, p. 51. There were also a number of lowbrow references in the opening section of Eliot's original manuscript (when the poem was entitled \\"He Do The Police in Different Voices\\"), but they were removed from the final draft after Eliot cut this original opening section. The style of the work in part grows out of Eliot's interest in exploring the possibilities of dramatic monologue. This interest dates back at least as far as \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\". The Waste Land is not a single monologue like \\"Prufrock\\". Instead, it is made up of a wide variety of voices (sometimes in monologue, dialogue, or with more than two characters speaking). The Waste Land is notable for its seemingly disjointed structure, indicative of the Modernist style of James Joyce's Ulysses (which Eliot cited as an influence and which he read the same year that he was writing The Waste Land).MacCabe, Colin. T. S. Eliot. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006. In the Modernist style, Eliot jumps from one voice or image to another without clearly delineating these shifts for the reader. He also includes phrases from multiple foreign languages (Latin, Greek, Italian, German, French and Sanskrit), indicative of Pound's influence. In 1936, E. M. Forster wrote about The Waste Land: Sources Sources from which Eliot quotes, or to which he alludes, include the works of Homer, Sophocles, Petronius, Virgil, Ovid,Dirk Weidmann: And I Tiresias have foresuffered all.... In: LITERATURA 51 (3), 2009, S. 98–108. Saint Augustine of Hippo, Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, Gérard de Nerval, Thomas Kyd, Geoffrey Chaucer, Thomas Middleton, John Webster, Joseph Conrad, John Milton, Andrew Marvell, Charles Baudelaire, Richard Wagner, Oliver Goldsmith, Hermann Hesse, Aldous Huxley, Paul Verlaine, Walt Whitman and Bram Stoker. Eliot also makes extensive use of Scriptural writings including the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer, the Hindu Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, and the Buddha's Fire Sermon, and of cultural and anthropological studies such as Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough and Jessie Weston's From Ritual to Romance (particularly its study of the Wasteland motif in Celtic mythology). Eliot wrote in the original head note that \\"Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L Weston\\". The symbols Eliot employs, in addition to the Waste Land, include the Fisher King, the Tarot Deck, the Chapel perilous, and the Grail Quest. According to Valerie Eliot, the character Marie in \\"The Burial of the Dead\\" is based on Marie Larisch, whom Eliot met at an indeterminate time and place.  Parodies  Parodies of this poem have also sprung up, most notably of which was by Eliot's contemporary, H. P. Lovecraft, a poem provocatively titled \\"Waste Paper: A Poem of Profound Insignificance\\". Written in 1923, it is regarded by scholars like S. T. Joshi as one of his best satires. Other recent parodies include \\"Not Wasted\\", in a BBC page reserved for parodies of Eliot's poetry. Wendy Cope published a parody of The Waste Land, condensing the poem into five limericks, Waste Land Limericks, in her 1986 collection Making Cocoa for Kingley Amis.Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis, Wendy Cope, Faber & Faber, 1986.

The school is located approximately 10 kilometres southeast of Asajaya. SMK Semera's students are mainly from Semera, Jemukan, Iboi, Sampun and a few more areas nearby, as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the SMK Asajaya. As of 30 June 2008, the school had an enrolment of 1,584 students.  Campus  SMK Semera consists of several parallel blocks of buildings and a corridor which connects them, and looks like extended \\"E\\" from above. Every block has windows on two sides, allowing light to pass through. This was done to save on energy costs, as the school was built during the prelude to the 1973 energy crisis. In 2007 a referendum was passed to add 8 new classrooms, an athletic training area and 2 toilets and to the original facility.  History  The establishment of SMK Semera was suggested by PIBG members, led by Mr. Haji Taha Salleh . Before the construction of the school, students in the community had to attend secondary school in Simunjan. Semera is a village that consists of approximately 400 students. In 1982, PIBG and the villagers built a seven-room school building, comprising two classrooms, two offices and three teacher's quarters. The school also had to borrow two classes from a primary school - SRK Haji Kelali, Semera. SMK Semera was called SMK Sadong Hilir at that time. In 1990 the school was moved to a new location behind the village. The name SMK Sadong Hilir was changed to SMK Semera. According to Mr. Zainuddin Kuan, Sarawak Educational Assistant Manager, the name “Semera” meant “at the same time”, for the cholera event that killed hundreds of villagers .

One of the qualifications the Board considered when assessing immigrants was \\"assimilability\\", a term not defined by the legislation and thus left to the board to interpret subjectively. \\"Unassimilability\\" was a criticism made of the Jews and thus its use as a criterion was seen as a pretext for excluding Jewish migrants. With the increase of Jewish immigration to South Africa in 1936, with the deterioration of the situation for Jews in Germany, so too increased political pressure within South Africa to curtail the migration. The United Party government led by Prime Minister Hertzog introduced the Bill in order to restrict and regulate immigration and exercise control over resident aliens. The National Party's Daniel Malan, leader of the opposition, unsuccessfully attempted to amend the bill to prohibit Jewish immigration explicitly, to end the further naturalization of Jewish permanent residents of South Africa and to close certain professions from Jews and \\"other non-assimilable races\\". Malan argued that Jews were getting the best jobs and that \\"the Afrikaner is suffering in consequence\\". Arguing for his amendment, Malan said of Jews, \\"Now the question arises with us, as a people, not only how we are going to keep them out in future, but how we are going to protect ourselves against those who are here.\\"Bunting, Brian, The Rise of the South African Reich (1969), chapter 4 The Jewish community within South Africa was divided on the bill. Jewish United Party MPs voted for it as it did not specifically mention Jews. Some members of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies supported the Bill as they feared Jewish immigration from Germany would intensify anti-Semitism within South Africa. The Aliens Act became law in February 1937 and put into place an Immigrants Selection Board which was given the power to issue or refuse to grant permits to any prospective immigrant who was not a citizen by birth or descent of the British Empire or Irish Free State. Jewish immigration from Germany fell as a result of the Act to a few thousand with approval for entry normally being given only to wives and young children of Jews already resident in South Africa or to their elderly parents or grandparents. In many cases, entry permits which had already been granted to relatives of South African Jews prior to the passage of the Act were cancelled and many German Jews who might otherwise had been able to find refuge in South Africa instead perished in the Holocaust.

It provides financial information, as well as investment tools. It is the UK's biggest flat-fee investment platform, with £36 billion of assets under administration, over 300,000 customers and more than one million users. The group is based in Manchester, with offices in London and Leeds.  History  Interactive Investor International was founded in 1994 by Sherry Coutu and funded by angel investors Richard Caruso and John Cooper, and the venture capital company, Arts Alliance. In 1995, Coutu hired Tomas Carruthers from ESI to bring trading capability and equities to supplement the company's fund-management information. Initially launched to provide front-end research to the investment community, it also provided a platform for investors to communicate through discussion boards. The name was changed to Interactive Investor following the company's withdrawal from the South African and Asian markets. The company has grown to be the UK's second-largest retail investment platform, with more than 300,000 customers and more than 7.4 million unique users per annum. It floated on the stock market in 2000 and was valued at £242 million. At the height of the dotcom boom it was valued at £684 million before it was bought by Australian financial services group AMP a year later. The investment platform briefly rebranded itself as Ample in 2002. The current interactive investor is a private limited company incorporated in 2003 and majority owned by funds advised by J.C. Flowers & Co, a leading private equity firm. ii first provided a dealing service in 2010, when it joined forces with Halifax Share Dealing, and went on to set up its own dealing function and customer service centre, based in Glasgow, in 2011. ii is 100% equity funded with no external debt and with corporate net assets of more than £100million.  Services and products  Through the company's direct-to- customer investing and trading service, investors can manage and trade shares, funds, investment trusts and bonds via trading accounts, ISAs and SIPPs. The platform also offers CFDs and spread betting accounts, as well as comprehensive (Level 2) market data.

In July 2020 the owners announced that the August 2020 editions of Moneywise and Money Observer would be the last and that the magazines would cease publication. On 8 January 2020, ii introduced free regular investing and became the first of the big investment platforms to scrap its fee for the service.  Acquisitions  ii bought personal finance magazine Moneywise from Reader's Digest in 2004. This was followed by the acquisition of investment magazine Money Observer from Guardian Media Group in 2008. The broker joined forces with Motley Fool Share Dealing in 2015, replacing Halifax Share Dealing as the brand's service provider. In October 2016, ii acquired the European business of TD Direct Investing (branded as TD Waterhouse) from its Canadian parent Toronto-Dominion Bank. With 300,000 UK customers, TD Direct was at the time larger than ii. The acquisition was completed in June 2017 and was financed by J.C. Flowers & Co, which became the majority shareholder in the group. In October 2018, ii announced a deal to buy Alliance Trust Savings, which was completed in July 2019 and brought together the two largest flat-fee online investment platforms.. In February 2020, ii announced its intention to acquire The Share Centre, an independent retail stockbroker. The acquisition was completed in July 2020.

Recyclebank claims to bring together people, businesses, and communities to achieve real world impact by participating in household recycling and teaching how to live more sustainable lifestyles. Over 2 million people have signed up through Recyclebank's rewards program, which offers magazine subscriptions and discounts among other goods. Recyclebank’s online shop, OneTwine.com claims to enable members to make more green choices when purchasing products. A Certified B Corporation, Recyclebank is headquartered in New York City. History In 2001, New York City was considering cancelling its recycling program. Then Fordham Law student Patrick FitzGerald drafted a business model to financially incentivize people to recycle and allow businesses to promote sustainability. This would show cities and municipalities the results of dramatically increased recycling rates. In 2003, he contacted high school friend Ron Gonen, who was pursuing an MBA at Columbia. They set out to build Recyclebank. A year later, they completed the business plan. By 2004, they rolled out a pilot recycling rewards program in Philadelphia. Since 2009, Recyclebank has been a certified B Corporation. Recyclebank also partners with NativeEnergy, a company that helps businesses reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, in order to offset its own carbon footprint. Between 2011 and 2012, Recyclebank reduced its carbon footprint by nearly 30% by making smarter travel decisions and being more conscious of its waste and recycling habits. Today, Recyclebank partners with communities all over the country and offers new ways to learn, earn points, and shop online. Program #For Members: Recyclebank claims to use education, rewards and impact metrics to help people live more sustainably. Through online engagement and a recycling incentives program, the company has helped increase recycling rates in some of its 300 member communities, has partnered to recycle nearly 3.8 billion pounds of waste, and helped move people toward a more sustainable future. On Recyclebank’s website, users earn points by working their way through a tiered series of questions and answers, learning about greener living practices and pledging to follow them, and exchanging points for rewards. #For Communities: In some communities, members can also earn points for recycling at home, as Recyclebank partners with municipalities and waste haulers in different cities around the country to track home recycling and reward it. These members who can earn this way are either part of the Collect and Click program, or the Curbside program. Collect and Click subscribers are awarded points based on how much they engage with Recyclebank's website. They can earn 10 additional points for reporting that they recycled each week. Curbside members that set out their recycling container are awarded points based on the average weight recycled by participating households on their collection route. By using RFID or GPS technology on recycling containers and the recycling truck, Recyclebank tracks which households are recycling. The collective weight is then converted to Recyclebank points and shared among all of the residents in the community that recycled. #For Brands: Recyclebank is also an advertising and sponsorship platform able to reach highly engaged consumers. Brands can sponsor content on Recyclebank and promote their own green strides, for example Ziploc, Domtar, and Johnson & Johnson have partnered with Recyclebank to educate enthusiastic green users on how to recycle the products they sell. Once members earn points, they can then redeem them for discounts and deals from community businesses and major national brands like SC Johnson, Unilever, Macy’s, as well as hundreds of community businesses, all found in Recyclebank’s Rewards Catalog. In this way it offers brands a unique opportunity to reach and engage millions of consumers by rewarding people through online and offline touch points. Gamification Recyclebank claims that it uses the idea of \\"gaming for good,\\" which combines game mechanics with environmental good, as they believe it can have a measurable impact on consumer behavior and the environment. Gamification can be used by brands to motivate employees, create healthy competition among teams, generate buzz or social proof, and encourage customer loyalty, among other benefits. When Recyclebank was founded in 2004, gamification was not a well-known term, but elements of gamification, such as points and rewards, were embedded in Recyclebank from the start. These gaming elements make recycling easy for people to relate to, it provides motivation and it helps put behavior in context of the larger community. Though Recyclebank started by focusing on curbside recycling, there are now many more ways to earn points. Members can earn by pledging to do various things: unplugging appliances, choosing greener products, taking shorter showers, and making green travel decisions (like carpooling and taking public transportation), or by taking quizzes to learn more about how to recycle certain things, or even by simply reading a slideshow for tips or more information about new advances in sustainability. Green Schools Program Each year, the Recyclebank Green Schools Program awards grants for unique environmental projects that positively affect students, schools and communities. Through the Green Schools Program, Recyclebank teaches children how to turn sustainable ideas into action and inspire them to make a real impact in their classrooms and communities. Recyclebank's partner Domtar Corporation, the sustainable paper company, helped make more green projects a reality by contributing additional donation dollars to participating schools. As part of its support for the Green Schools Program, in 2014 Domtar also planned to award a year's supply of Domtar EarthChoice® Office Paper to the school with the most innovative project. Since 2007, the Recyclebank Green Schools Program has awarded close to $500,000 to more than 150 schools for projects designed to creatively improve their schools. Each year participating schools, their students and their communities work to encourage residents to donate Recyclebank points that the company then transfers into real dollars for schools—turning a community's green actions into funds for a local school. Because of this year's impressive submissions, Recyclebank is also funding up to 50 percent of each proposal that did not meet its goal. In addition to providing a year's supply of paper to the C.W. Henry School, Domtar awarded $500 to each school that was able to reach 50 percent of its donation goal. More than half of the 29 participating schools reached 50 percent of their fundraising goals and will receive funds from Domtar. With the launch of the new online shop, One Twine, Recyclebank also announced that it will donate 5% of profits to the Green Schools Program. One Twine On Earth Day 2014 (April 22), Recyclebank launched One Twine, a new online shop to discover carefully vetted products that are better for your home, your wallet and the planet. In addition to discovering socially and environmentally conscious goods, customers will also find great deals on the products they love on OneTwine.com. To get even more value, Recyclebank members can apply the points they've earned for learning how to live more sustainably and taking actions toward purchases on One Twine. Building on Recyclebank's expertise in sustainability, every item on One Twine has been evaluated through their Impact Lens, a list of nine criteria that consider the product's total environmental impact. To help people make more informed choices, One Twine clearly displays icons next to each product that highlight which criteria it meets, and includes insightful content related to those principles. One Twine's Impact Lens considers the following criteria for each product: *  Renewable – Made from recycled materials or renewable resources *  Gentle Impact – Ingredients and by-products are free of harsh chemicals that may be bad for health or the environment *  Fair – Makers of this product were treated fairly *  Sustainably Made – Manufacturer has worked to minimize environmental impact *  Efficient – Product more efficiently uses resources and/or helps reduce pollution *  Promotes Sustainability – This product makes it easier and more convenient to lead a more eco-friendly life *  Reclaimable – This product itself is recyclable, reusable and/or biodegradable *  Smart Packaging – Packaging materials are minimal and/or made from recyclable, reusable or biodegradable materials *  Merchant Buy Back – This product can be re-sold or given back to the manufacturer The name One Twine is a nod to the traditional corner store, the community hub where shopkeepers connected individuals with high-quality, all- natural goods. Purchases at this store were often bound by brown paper and twine—a single thread woven from many fibers. Recyclebank feels this image ties into the online shop’s theme because just like those durable, interwoven threads of twine, they believe that through making small actions and buying great products, people and the brand can be collectively bound for a better future. At launch, One Twine featured more than 400 products from nearly 30 brands across household, health and beauty, children, pets, and gear and gadgets categories. Shoppers can find a mix of established brands as well as up-and-coming companies. One Twine now has 1,000 products on the site.

The next year the story was included in These 13, Faulkner's first collection of short stories. \\"Red Leaves\\" has been described as \\"a vision of the inexorable, brutal pattern of nature that decrees that every living thing must die\\". The title of the story symbolizes the American Indian, specifically the Chickasaw: Plot summary With the death of Chief Issetibbeha, custom demands that all the Chickasaw leader's prized possessions be buried alive in the earth along with him. This includes his black servant, a slave who has served the chief since boyhood. The unnamed slave makes a desperate bid for freedom, taking refuge in the swamps and reflecting on his past life. Meanwhile, the dead chief's son Moketubbe, who is grossly overweight and has no real interest in leadership, is forced to marshal his forces and begin a manhunt for the fugitive slave. The few Indians willing to accompany Moketubbe are equally corrupt, decadent, and full of despair. As they slowly close in on the missing slave, they too reflect on the past, discussing the ways in which slavery and the coming of the white man have doomed them to crime, violence, and slow extinction as a people.

At the age of 22, Galán embarked on her career in entertainment as the nation's youngest station manager for WNJU TV Channel 47 in New York. Owned by Jerry Perenchio and Norman Lear, the station became the launchpad for what is now the Telemundo Network. Galán created and produced the Telemundo reality television program La Cenicienta (Cinderella). Hosted by Eva Tamargo, the program broke ground for Telemundo’s reality television programming.

Richard John Stewart arrived in the Okanagan Valley from County Kildare, Ireland in 1908. He and his 2 brothers purchased several parcels of land and established nurseries. In 1956, his son Richard Stewart acquired the Allison Ranch on which the winery now sits and started planting vines along with fruit orchards. His son Ben, a banker by trade started working at Quails’ Gate in the 1980s. In 1989, the family abandoned the orchards and focused the properties on producing wine, relaunching the business as Quails’ Gate Estate Winery. In 1992, Richards' other son, Tony, left his career as a stockbroker to return to the family business.https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1552856038 John Schreiner p.268 Tony now runs the business still privately held by the Stewart family.

Originally they were bilingual (Russian/English), but were changed into Russian-only. The responses to the questionnaire in it may still be completed in English. The card is issued in two identical parts, of which part A is surrendered to the immigration officer upon entrance to Russia, while part B, stamped by the officer, must be kept with the passport to be presented to the Russian or Belarusian officials whenever the identity check is demanded. Upon each Union State border crossing the arrival/departure must be stamped on the migration card. Alternatively, the card may be surrendered upon the departure and a new one received upon subsequent arrival. A migration card must be produced along with passport in order to register a foreign citizen. Registration must be done within 7 business days since arrival to each place of stay in Russia, and 5 business days in Belarus (this term is prolonged for citizens of certain countries). The process is colloquially called \\"registering one's visa\\" though it applies to visa-exempt foreign nationals as well. Before the new law \\"About Migration Registration\\" of January 15, 2007, the registration procedure was done by the local Passport and Visa Department (Russian: ПВУ) or Visa and Registration Department (Russian: ОВИР) of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), typically at a local militsiya office. The residence registration could have been denied, but if approved, the migration card would be stamped. Since adoption of the new law it became sufficient to inform the Federal Migration service, either in person or through a post office using a special form.

This plant is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, but it is found throughout the temperate world, where it has naturalized. This is an erect mustard-like plant rarely reaching half a meter in height. It has lobed leaves and its stems are topped with dense inflorescences of yellow, or occasionally light purple, flowers with small oval petals and large anthers. The fruit is a podlike silique two to four centimeters long. Description It is an annual, but sometimes grows as a perennial, growing up to tall on unbranched stems. It has lobed leaves, which form a rosette at the base of the plant. They are long and wide. It blooms in summer, between May to September in the UK, and between April to August in China. The flowers are yellow, with oblong sepals and longer, obovate petals. Later, it produces a fruit capsule, long cylindrical with a short beak. It contains 2 rows of yellow brown seeds, which are ovoid or ellipsoid shaped. Taxonomy It was first published by Augustin Candolle in Syst. Nat. Vol.2 on page 634 in 1821, based on an earlier description by Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus had named it 'Sisymbrium murale' in his seminal publication 'Species Plantarum' in 1753. The Latin specific epithet muralis is derived from the Latin word meaning 'growing on the wall'Archibald William Smith It is commonly known as 'annual wall-rocket' or 'wall rocket', in the UK,F.H.Perring, P.D.Sell and S.M.Walters as it can be found growing on old walls, and is similar in form to wall rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia ), which is taller and bushier. It has 2 known subspecies; * Diplotaxis muralis subsp. ceratophylla (Batt.) Mart.-Laborde * Diplotaxis muralis subsp. simplex (Viv.) Jafri Several cytological and morphological studies have suggested that D. muralis originated from natural hybridization between D. tenuifolia and D. viminea. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate regions of North Africa, Europe and parts of western Asia. =Range= It is found in North Africa, within Algeria, Libya, Ethiopia, Morocco and Tunisia. Within Asia it is found in the Caucasus, Georgia (country) and Turkey. In middle Europe, it is in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland. In southeastern Europe, within Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Malta, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine. Also in southwestern Europe, it is found in France, Portugal and Spain. It has naturalised in the UK since 1778, when it was found in a field of oats raised from imported seeds from a ship wrecked on the Kent coast. =Habitat= It grows in waste and disturbed ground, such as beside railways, roads and on tips. Ecology It is pollinated by bees and other flying insects. It is occasionally cultivated and ploughed into fields as a 'green manure'.

The cake then rises through the liquid which settles at the bottom of the pan, mixing with the batter and creating a distinct layer at the bottom of the dish. The syrup or caramel can be made from brown sugar, white sugar, maple syrup or a combination of these. At the depth of the Depression, stale bread was also used in lieu of cake batter.

Clarke's Beach is a town on Conception Bay in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. In the 2016 census the town had a population of 1,558. It is the home of a number of well-known Newfoundland artists, and is a favourite place for retirement.  History  Clarke's Beach first appears in census records in 1857, with a population of 280. Many of the early settlers came from Bareneed and Port de Grave when these two settlements ran out of space for curing fish and when the Labrador fishery became prominent. The first settlers initially came to the area for timber, then for planting vegetables on the cleared land.  Sawmills  The earliest record of sawmilling activity in the area dates to circa 1611-1620, when the settlers of the John Guy colony in Cupids built a sawmill and pit saws in nearby South River. No further sawmills were built until 1885, when William and Reuben Horwood began a steam-operated sawmill at Clarke's Beach, a partnership which also had business dealings with Colin Campbell, a sawmill operator at Campbellton and Dog Bay, Notre Dame Bay. It employed 112 men in 1891, which, at the time, were nearly all the men in Clarke's Beach. W.J. Horwood announced in January of 1893 that he had sold his \\"Clarke's Beach Milling Plant\\" to George C. Jerrett. Jerrett took over the shingle and lumber mill business, producing shingles, laths, lobster cases, matched lumber, and clapboard. In 1895, it was reported that Jerrett's Mill was also producing spruce joisting and studding. From 1894-1899 (at least), Jerrett also operated another shingle mill in Shoal Bay, Trinity Bay. In the early 1900s, as the Horwoods moved their operations, at least two other mills opened. One mill was operated before 1909 by George Bussey. George Wilson established a sawmill in 1943. Another water-powered mill owned by Wilson, but operated by Horwood’s, was located on the main road in South River. By the 1920s, fish casks and drums were being made as a side industry: > \\"Merchants would have schooner loads and car loads of birch sent here each > spring from Bonavista Bay,\\" recalls Garfield Ralph. \\"Shopkeepers would buy > the material and give it out to people, stuff for heads, hoops, and staves. > You would get 1,000 staves, enough to make 100 drums, and you would probably > make 15 cents on each one. If you worked at it 10 hours a day you could make > a dollar. Everybody in Clarke's Beach made fish drums until the '30s, but > once the war started nobody would go at it.\\" In 1960, George Wilson was advertising as a \\"Lumber Manufacturer\\" and as a dealer in doors, window sashes, boxes, wallboard, and builder's hardware. By the 1970s it was the only sawmill in operation in the community.

This plant is native to Europe and Western Asia. It can be found throughout much of the temperate world where it has naturalized. This is an erect mustard-like plant with branching stems that may exceed half a meter in height. It grows in clumps on the ground in a variety of habitats and is a common weed of roadsides and disturbed areas. It has long leaves which may be lobed or not. The foliage is aromatic when crushed. Atop the branches of the stem are bright yellow flowers with four rounded petals each about a centimeter long. The fruit is a straight, flat silique up to five centimeters long. Common names Perennial wall rocket, wild rocket, sand rocket, Lincoln weed, white rocket; seeds sometimes marketed as \\"wild Italian arugula\\" or \\"sylvetta arugula\\". Nutrients Wild rocket is high in ascorbic acid, carotenoids, polyphenols and glucosinolates (above all glucosativin and glucoerucin, which are the cause of the pungent flavour). When the leaves are chewed glucosinolates, through the enzyme myrosinase, are metabolized in isothyocyanates and indoles. Commercial cultivation Baby leaf rocket is cultivated worldwide as a salad leaf. In addition to D. tenuifolia, the annual Eruca sativa is grown and marketed under the same common names. These leaves are usually mixed with other baby leaf crops to form a mesclun-style salad. These crops have become popular due to their distinctive taste and texture in salads. Leaves preserved at 5 °C show a loss of ascorbic acid and glucosinolates and an increase in polyphenols (then preservation after harvesting may be nutritionally good, since for example sinapic acid and ferulic acid have anti- cancer effects and umbelliferone is an anti-oxidant).

Operating from a studio at the rear of a shop belonging to Aberdeen Electrical Engineering at 17 Belmont Street and a transmitter located on the premises of the Aberdeen Steam Laundry Company, the station broadcast on a frequency of 606 kHz (495 m) medium wave.The History of Aberdeen Radio : article by Gordon Bathgate from the online edition of Leopard Magazine, February 2005. Retrieved on 8 January 2008. Planning After being appointed managing director of the BBC in 1922, John Reith instigated a programme of expansion of the radio network in the United Kingdom, increasing the number of local stations from three to twenty in a relatively short period of time. Aberdeen was one of the first new stations to be put on air. Inception The opening ceremony for the station was conducted by the Marquis of Aberdeen at 9pm on 10 October 1923, followed by a performance from the Band of the 2nd Gordon Highlanders. Those attending the launch included the Lord Provost of Aberdeen, BBC MD John Reith, station director R. E. Jeffery, and chief engineer Peter Eckersley. Technical data Inside the studio, broadcasters used a single microphone on a wheeled base, which severely restricted the number of users at any one time. Being transmitted from the Aberdeen Steam Laundry Company building, the signal then travelled to an aerial slung between two Marconi radio masts sited beside some nearby electrical generators (which frequently interfered with broadcasts). Although the transmitter was of low power, it was reported that the first programmes were heard in Norway and, similarly, subsequent broadcasts more than a year later could be heard in the United States during \\"International Radio Week\\". Format During a live six- hour transmission day, the station supplied a mix of light music, comedy, news, and sports reporting. A former Scottish football referee, Peter Craigmyle, broadcast a 15-minute programme once a week devoted to previewing sports events. The station had its own \\"2BD Repertory Company\\" with members including William Mair, Daisy Moncur, Grace Wilson and George Dewar. It had its own 12-piece orchestra, supplemented by harmonica player Donald Davidson, although they were reduced to eight members in 1926, and disbanded after the demise of the station. Comedy was supplied by entertainers such as Jessie R. F. Allan, and many other artistes appeared before the microphone, including local boy Harry Gordon and character actress Mabel Constanduris. Expansion and decline In May 1925, 2BD's premises were extended to take in number 15 Belmont Street; however, in 1926 the \\"Geneva Frequency Plan\\" cut the number of available wavelengths by 50%. 2BD's frequency was changed to 610 kHz (491.8 m) with effect from 14 November 1926 and then a month later – because of the interference caused by 2BD having to share a frequency with the BBC's Birmingham station, 5IT – to 600 kHz (500 m). In time, the Aberdeen station, along with other local Scottish transmitters, was replaced by a Scottish Regional Programme covering most of the country on a single high-power medium- wave frequency, while a long-wave transmitter (sited first at Chelmsford, then Daventry, and finally at Droitwich) was powerful enough to provide a National Programme audible throughout most of the United Kingdom,Change of transmission frequencies: Radio Rewind website.

McKinley was shot),\\" historical postcard. The Temple of Music was a concert hall and auditorium built for the Pan-American Exposition which was held in Buffalo, New York in 1901. United States President William McKinley was assassinated inside the building on September 6, 1901 by Leon Czolgosz. The structure, like most of the other buildings at the exposition, was demolished when the fair ended.  The building  The Temple of Music was designed by architects August Esenwein and James A. Johnson for the Pan-American Exhibition, to serve as a concert hall and ceremonial stage. It was built at a cost of $85,000 (well over $1,500,000 in 2008 dollars). It was an eclectic combination of various architectural elements. Its major influence was the Italian Renaissance style, and it complied with the Exposition's Board of Architects' overall plan for the exhibition, called the Free Renaissance style. Like most of the major structures at this World Fair, the Temple of Music was extensively electrified, both internally and externally.  The style  The Temple's dome rose 180 feet (54.86 m) above the ground floor and the hall itself had seating for over 2,000 people. According to Chuck LaChiusa, a Buffalo native and retired City Honors English teacher, \\"The building was colored in light yellows, with gold and red trimmings, and the panels in the dome were in light blue, producing an extremely beautiful effect.\\" Four ornate sculptures, representing sacred music, lyric music, music of the dance, and heroic music, executed by Isodore Konti, graced the four entrance portals into the building. The Temple's appeal lay in its spacious interior and new use of lighting. Although the exterior was a great sight, the interiorhttp://www.buffaloah.com/a/archs/ej/dem/tempmus2.jpg was also impressive. The Temple of Music had seating for over 2,000 people and possessed one of the largest pipe organs ever built in the United States. The organ is now at St. Louis Roman Catholic Church in Buffalo. A popular local legend holds that a stained glass dome in the now-vacant J.N. Adam Memorial Hospital in Perrysburg, New York, was salvaged from the Temple of Music. However, a visual comparison between the hospital's dome and this rendering of the Temple of Music shows no resemblance between the two.  The creator  August Esenwein was born in Esenwein-Virnsberg, in the Kingdom of Wuertemburg, South Germany in 1856. The family moved to the United States in 1861 and returned to Germany in 1871, where August went to private elementary schools. He attended the University of Stuttgart for five years, studying architecture and engineering. After graduation, Esenwein went to Paris, where he worked as a draughtsman. After two years in Paris, Esenwein emigrated to the United States and settled in Buffalo, where he worked as an architect. The Temple of Music was Esenwein's submission to an architectural competition for the Pan- American Exposition and it won first place. He went on to design three more buildings for the Exposition: the Administration Building, Alt Nurnberg, and the brick-art gallery. Esenwein also served on the Pan-American Board of Architects.  The assassination  assassination site as it appears today The Temple of Music is primarily remembered today as the site of the assassination of United States President William McKinley. On September 5, 1901, McKinley delivered a speech on tariffs and foreign trade at the exposition. The following day, designated as \\"President's Day\\" at the exposition, McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz while greeting the public at the Temple of Music. McKinley died one week later in Buffalo.  Location  After the Exposition closed, the Temple of Music and the other plaster buildings were torn down, and the area between Delaware Avenue and Elmwood Avenue was turned into a residential subdivision bisected by the Lincoln Parkway. The Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society placed a stone and marker on a traffic island dividing Fordham Drive, near that parkway, to mark the area where the Temple of Music was located. \\"But the spot where the assassination actually took place has been the subject of speculation for much of the century,\\" a reporter would write more than 87 years after the event, adding, \\"Some say it's a toss-up between 30 and 34 Fordham Drive, while others say it occurred across the street at 29 Fordham or at the end of the island.\\" \\"Quiet Street Enjoys a Place in History\\", by Anthony Cardinale, Buffalo News, March 12, 1989 pB-11  Footnotes  References  * Buffalo as an Architectural Museum: August Esenwein (1856–1926) * Buffalo as an Architectural Museum: Esenwein & Johnson in Buffalo, NY * Music and Musicians at the Pan-American Exposition: The Temple of Music Category:Concert halls in New York (state) Category:History of Buffalo, New York Category:1901 in the United States Category:World's fair architecture in New York (state) Category:Demolished buildings and structures in New York (state) Category:Assassination of William McKinley Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Buffalo, New York ","title":"Temple of Music"},{"id":"15108867","text":"John Alexander Macdonald Armstrong (November 19, 1877 in King Township, Ontario, Canada – February 2, 1926) was a Canadian politician, conveyancer and real estate agent.

Life The son of Ignaz Ferstel (17961866), a bank clerk and later director of the Austrian national bank in Prague, Heinrich Ferstel, after wavering for some time between the different arts, finally decided on architecture. From 1847 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Eduard van der Nüll and August Sicard von Sicardsburg. After several years during which he was in disrepute because of his part in the 1848 Revolution, he finished his studies in 1850 and entered the atelier of his uncle, Friedrich August von Stache, where he worked at the votive altar for the chapel of St. Barbara in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and co-operated in the restoration and construction of many castles, chiefly in Bohemia. Journeys of some length into Germany, Belgium, Holland, and England confirmed him in his tendency towards Romanticism. It was in Italy, however, where he was sent as a bursar in 1854, that he was converted to the Renaissance style of architecture, and his admiration for Bramante. He began to use of polychromy by means of Graffito decoration and terracotta. This device, adapted from the Early Renaissance and intended to convey a fuller sense of life, he employed later in the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts. Votivkirche, Vienna While still in Italy he was awarded the prize in the competition for the Votive Church (Votivkirche) in Vienna (1855) over 74 contestants. He built it between 1856-79. After his death it was proposed by Sir Tatton Sykes as a model for the new Westminster Cathedral in London. Another of Ferstel's monumental works belonging to the same period is the Austro-Hungarian bank in Vienna, in the style of the Early Renaissance (1856–60). Designing public buildings in the inner city and Ringstrasse area, the expansion of the city of Vienna enabled Ferstel, with Rudolf Eitelberger, to develop civic architecture along artistic lines (Burgomaster's residence, Stock Exchange 1859). At the same time he had also the opportunity of putting his ideas into practice in a number of private dwellings and villas in Brünn and Vienna. The more important buildings designed during his later years (passing over the churches at Schonau near Teplitz, really products of his earlier activity) are the palace of Archduke Ludwig Victor, his winter palace in Klessheim, the palace of Prince Johann II of Liechtenstein in the Rossau near Vienna, the palace of the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's, in Trieste, but above all the Austrian Museum for Applied Art (completed in 1871), with its imposing arcaded court. Next comes the University of Vienna (1871–84). He was also an author of the project of the reconstruction in the Neo-Gothic style the evangelical Church's of Saviour in Bielsko (1881–1882). Through a technical error his design for the Berlin Reichstag building received no award. In 1866 Ferstel was appointed professor at the Polytechnic School, in 1871 chief government inspector of public works and in 1879 was raised to the rank of Freiherr.

Early life John Martorano was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1940. He is the older brother of James \\"Jimmie\\" Martorano by eleven months. His father, Angelo \\"Andy\\" Martorano was an immigrant from Riesi, Sicily, and with his family he emigrated to the United States around 1915, to East Boston. His mother Elizabeth Mary \\"Bess\\" Hunt was an Irish descendant, who lived in Somerville.Carr, Howie (2011); HITMAN: The Untold Story of Johnny Martorano Martorano was raised Catholic and served as an altar boy. The Martorano family moved to the Irish enclave of East Milton. Martorano and his brother attended St Agatha's parochial grammar school in Milton through grade 8, where Martorano was a classmate of future congressman Bill Delahunt's. Martorano attended Mount Saint Charles Academy in Woonsocket, Rhode Island as a freshman while his brother remained in Milton, enrolling in Cunningham Junior High School. Later in his freshman year, Martorano dropped out of Mount Saint Charles and joined Jimmie at Cunningham. During high school, he and Jimmie were standout football players, and were elected co- captains of the team for their senior season in 1958. Although recruited by several college teams, Martorano did not continue his education beyond his graduation from Milton High. In a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft, Martorano claimed that when he was young his father told him, \\"You're the oldest son and this is your heritage\\" (referring to his father's connections to organized crime). \\"You've got to take care of your family and be a man.\\" Criminal career After graduating from high school, Martorano turned down seven football scholarships and instead stayed in Boston. Hanging out in the Combat Zone, Martorano fell under the guidance of Stephen Flemmi, and by the age of 25 had become a professional mobster. He committed his first murder at 24, when he allegedly killed Patriarca crime family made man Robert S. Palladino, who was going to testify in a case involving the murder of prostitute Barbara Sylvester in his father's restaurant. Ralph DeMasi, a Boston mobster incarcerated in White Deer, Pennsylvania, would later write to the courts that when he was driving down Morrissey Boulevard with fellow Irish mobster William (Billy) O'Brien in 1964, Martorano pulled up in a car alongside them and gunned down O'Brien, shooting him seventeen times with a machine gun and wounding DeMasi. In his letter about the events that almost led to his death he wrote, \\"I thought someone was taking target practice at us. It was my good friend John Martorano.\\" Martorano rapidly became one of the Winter Hill Gang's most prolific enforcers under the tenures of Howie Winter and Whitey Bulger. In January 1968, after Hubert \\"Smitty\\" Smith, an African- American man, helped mobsters Rocco Lammattina and John Cincotti beat up Flemmi in an after-hours saloon, Martorano confronted Smith at the saloon the night after the beating. Despite being ignorant of the circumstances behind Flemmi's beating, Martorano challenged Smith and questioned him about the altercation between Lammattina and Cincotti versus Flemmi. When recounting Smith's responses, Martorano said, \\"He (Smith) kept giving me the wrong answers. He didn't give me any respect. All he had to say was 'I didn't know he was your friend, I'm sorry.' That's all he needed to say.\\" After Smith failed to answer Martorano's challenge satisfactorily, Martorano tracked Smith to a car on Normandy Street in Dorchester. Smith was accompanied by a 19-year- old woman, Elizabeth Frances \\"Liz\\" Dickson, and a 17-year-old boy, Douglas Barrett. Martorano walked up to the car and killed all three occupants with his .38-caliber snubnosed revolver. In 1979, Flemmi and Bulger learned that Martorano and several other Winter Hill members, including James \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Mulvey, were about to be indicted for a horse race-fixing scheme involving Fat Tony Ciulla. They warned Martorano, who quickly fled to Florida. He spent the next 16 years as a fugitive, although he was frequently called on to take part in murders. Along with Winter Hill member Joe McDonald, he was the triggerman for the hits on Roger Wheeler and John Callahan. Arrested in 1995, Martorano was charged, along with Flemmi and two Boston mafiosi, on a massive racketeering indictment; however, he abruptly agreed to a plea bargain deal in 1999. He was angered that Bulger and Flemmi hadn't made any effort to keep him out of the 1979 race-fixing indictment, but had persuaded corrupt FBI agent John Connolly to ensure they wouldn't be indicted. More seriously, Bulger and Flemmi had been the ones to tip off authorities about Martorano's whereabouts. In return for confessing his murders, Martorano received a reduced prison sentence of 12 years. In 2007, he was released from prison and given $20,000 to start a new life. =Murder victims of John Martorano's= *Alfredo \\"Indian Al\\" Angeli *John Banno *Douglas Barrett *John Callahan *Richard Castucci *Elizabeth Frances \\"Liz\\" Dickson *Ronald Hicks *John Jackson *Thomas \\"Tommy\\" King *Michael Milano *Joseph J. \\"Indian Joe\\" Notarangeli *William L. \\"Billy\\" O'Brien *James \\"Spike\\" O'Toole *Robert Palladino *Albert Plummer *Herbert \\"Smitty\\" Smith *James Sousa *Anthony Veranis *Roger Wheeler 60 Minutes interview On January 15, 2008, Martorano was interviewed by Steve Kroft on the CBS News television program 60 Minutes. Initially, Martorano had agreed to have Ed Bradley interview him, but Bradley died before this could occur. During the interview, Martorano expressed remorse for killing Elizabeth Dickson, the woman in the car in Dorchester. Although his friends Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi are considered by many criminologists and investigators to be serial killers, Martorano told Kroft, \\"I might be a vigilante, but not a serial killer. Serial killers, you have to stop them. They'll never stop, they enjoy it. I never enjoyed it. I don't enjoy risking my life but if the cause was right, I would.\\" Whitey Bulger trial In June 2013, Martorano testified as a prosecution witness in Whitey Bulger's trial in Boston, Massachusetts, but James \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Mulvey refused to cooperate. Many believe that Mulvey's assistance would have implicated others. Mulvey has never been charged with any crimes in connection with Bulger or the Winter Hill Gang. Personal life Martorano was married to Carolyn Wood, an Irish- American, with whom he fathered 5 children, including Vincent, John Jr. and Jeannie Martorano. Carolyn divorced him in 1975, after twelve years of marriage In popular culture In the Whitey Bulger biopic Black Mass (2015), Martorano is portrayed by W. Earl Brown.

History  The town was named after Edward Hawke by James Cook in 1766. This was to commemorate Hawke's victory in the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759. Although Hawke's Bay was used as an enclave during the early struggle for North America by both the English and French navies, it was not until the early 20th century that Michael Walsh became the first permanent settler. In 1903, a whaling station was established on the north side of the bay, but it closed the following year. Sydney Cotton ran the first airmail service in Newfoundland to Hawke's Bay. In 1933, pulpwood harvesting was established in the area by the International Pulp and Paper Company. The first Postmistress was Miss Dorothea Desse Hoddinott who died in August 2003.  Climate  Hawke's Bay has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb). Summers are mild and rainy while winters are chilly and extremely snowy, with average annual snowfall totaling 142 inches (360.5 cm). Winter typically begins during November and can last well into April, and can see nightly lows dip well below zero.

It is located about a 10 minutes' drive from downtown St. John's and adjacent to the Town of Torbay on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula.  History  The area encompassing Logy Bay-Middle Cove-Outer Cove is within the boundaries of lands granted to the London and Bristol Company in 1610. In 1627, the company experienced financial difficulties and evidently made lands available to private groups. The name Logy Bay itself first appears on Southwood's map of = 1675, however, permanent settlement did not begin until the early 19th century. The earliest record of settlement in Logy Bay is from 1818 when Luke Ryan, a fisherman, sought permission to build a fishing room. The earliest records of settlement in Outer Cove and Middle Cove appear around 1827, but occupation here most likely predated this year. The early settlers of Logy Bay-Middle Cove-Outer Cove were immigrants predominantly from the Irish counties of Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford, and Cork. In particular, the town of Inistioge in Kilkenny was the origin of most of the pioneers of Logy Bay. These early settlers were attracted to the area by the easy access to the excellent fishing grounds that lay just offshore and by the good farmland that dotted the region. Between 1827 and 1830 there were 9 petitions for land in Logy Bay, 3 in Middle Cove and 30 in Outer Cove. By the 1850s, the Irish had established themselves and proceeded to shape the landscape. Irish heritage is still strong today and can be seen in such things as religion, folkways, music, and dialect.

Dywizja Piechoty Legionów) was a tactical unit of the Polish Army between the World Wars. Formed in 1919, as a third unit composed significantly of veterans of the Polish Legions in World War I (after Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division and Polish 2nd Legions Infantry Division), it saw extensive action during the Polish-Bolshevik War and the Invasion of Poland. In the interbellum period, the headquarters of the division was stationed in Zamość, while its regiments were garrisoned in Chelm, Lublin, Zamosc and other locations. The division was officially formed on April 9, 1919, in former Austrian Galicia, during the ongoing Polish- Ukrainian War. At the beginning it consisted of three regiments (7th Legions Infantry, 8th Legions Infantry and 3rd Legions Light Artillery), but was later reinforced with 9th Infantry Regiment.  The Division in September 1939  In accordance with Polish mobilization plan (see Plan West), the division, commanded by Colonel Marian Turkowski, was to form main force of southern group of Prusy Army. On September 3, 1939, its first battalions detrained in the area of Radom - Jedlnia. Since divisional headquarters was still on the way to the concentration point, these battalions were temporarily commanded by General Gustaw Paszkiewicz of the 12th Infantry Division. After concentration, the division was sent to defend the positions along the Krasna river, near Samsonow and Krasna. Several battalions were unable to reach their positions. In the morning of September 6, 1939, German 3rd Light Division attacked. The enemy was divided into two columns, advancing from Mniow towards Samsonow and Krasna. First German assault was repelled, but after a few hours, the enemy attacked again, supported by its artillery. At app. 2 pm, retreat was ordered, as Polish positions were exposed and there was a danger of encirclement. After the Germans had captured Krasna, Poles withdrew along forest roads towards Radom. During the morning battle, the Germans lost 103 KIA and app. 15 tanks and armoured carriers. Polish losses were 33 KIA. Since German armoured forces succeeded in breaking Polish positions and quickly advanced, General Stanislaw Skwarczynski ordered all units to withdraw behind the Vistula river. The crossing was to take place in several stages, with final stage taking place on the bridge at Solec nad Wisla, on September 10. In the night of September 7/8, the Third Legions Division, together with elements of the 12th Division, marched northwards, to Ilza. The defence of the town was given to the 7th Regiment, supported by light artillery. Other regiments were located in the nearby villages, while 12th Division took positions in the forests near Starachowice. Meanwhile, German 1st Light Division advanced along the road from Konskie to Radom and Kozienice. On September 9, the Germans captured river crossing at Maciejowice, and concentrated near Radom. South of Polish group, German divisions also advanced, hoping to encircle the Poles. These Wehrmacht units, however, consisted mostly of infantry, which was much slower than motorized regiments. On September 6, the Germans captured Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski, and two days later, Skarzysko-Kamienna, advancing then towards Szydlowiec in an attempt to divide the Poles into two groups. On September 9, a regiment of German tanks surprised the headquarters of the 3rd Legions Division, which at that time was located south of the village of Seredzice. After a bloody clash, the enemy was repelled. 7th Legions Infantry Regiment, stationed in Ilza, was attacked by tanks of the 3rd Light Division. After losing three tanks, the Germans regrouped and assaulted again, with artillery support. At app. 1700 Polish soldiers began to abandon their positions under heavy artillery fire. German infantry then entered the battle, in support of the tanks. Due to quick reaction of Polish officers, the crisis was overcome and Ilza remained in Polish hands. Following the plan, elements of Polish 3rd and 12th Infantry Divisions prepared for the march to the forests between Ilza and Lipsko. To disorient the enemy, 8th Legions Regiment carried out a successful attack on German positions at Trebowiec Duzy. In the evening of September 9, commandant of the 3rd Legions Division formed an assault group, tasked with opening the route for the retreating units. The group consisted of 1st Battalion of the 7th Regiment and 1st Battalion of the 9th Regiment, supported by two artillery batteries. Its task was to remove German elements from the road Lipsko - Ilza. The attack began at 2030, but Polish soldiers were immediately sprayed by machine gun fire from German positions on the local hills. Nevertheless, the Poles advanced, reaching the headquarters of German 9th Motorized Infantry Regiment, whose commandant was killed in battle. Soon afterwards, however, several Polish soldiers and officers were killed by German machine guns. Despite numerous attempts, Polish assault failed, and at app. 9 pm, soldiers of the 9th Legions Regiment returned to their starting positions. German losses amounted to 4 tanks, unknown number of vehicles and motorcycles, as well as several KIA and WIA. After the clash, elements of the 3rd Legions Division were ordered to try to break through German positions and reach Solec nad Wisla. Polish soldiers, in groups of app. 300, concentrated in local forests, but the division as such ceased to exist. Those who managed to cross the Vistula joined 1st Legions Infantry Division, and fought in the Battle of Tomaszow Lubelski. Other soldiers joined the unit of Colonel Stanislaw Gumowski, which was part of Polish Northern Front (1939), and fought near Krasnystaw. In mid-September 1939, some 500 reservists of the 3rd Division were sent to Kowel, where new units were formed. When news of the Soviet invasion of Poland reached the town, the soldiers were ordered to break to Hungary on their own.

The town's original European residents were mainly descendants of French and English fishermen who settled in the area after 1904 when France relinquished its rights to fish, and for the first time permanent settlement was allowed. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, the French were given exclusive rights to fish in an area known as The French Shore, which this area is part of. At Point Riche, The French Shore Treaty monument is erected to commemorate this historic event in Newfoundland history.  Modern town  Known as the \\"fishing capital\\" of Western Newfoundland, it boasts a large fishing fleet, a modern shrimp processing plant, Federal Fisheries Offices, Parks Canada Visitor Reception Centre, restaurants, motel, RV Park, modern sports complex, bank, as well as other financial institutions and government services. Port au Choix is an amalgamation of three once separate communities - Old Port au Choix, Gargamelle Cove and Port au Choix. Today's Port au Choix still retains its close association with the sea and its cultural history. There are other sightseeing attractions, including Pointe Riche Lighthouse, the Heritage Museum, the French Shore treaty site, Studio Gargamille, and the fish plant registered to Ocean Choice International. The nearest airport is Port au Choix Airport, 2.8 km to the southeast.  Population  The population was 505 in 1940 and 214 by 1956. The population increased to 1010 in 2001, then decreased to 893 in 2006.  National Historic Site  Port au Choix is a National Historic Site of Canada, and the community is regarded as one of the richest archeological finds in North America. Burial sites uncovered in the town in the 1960s & 70s provide evidence of its earliest settlers - from the Maritime Archaic Indians to the Groswater and Dorset Palaeoeskimos to the Recent Indians (ancestors of the Beothuks). While prehistoric coastlines elsewhere have long since slipped beneath the encroaching ocean, the raised shoreline and alkaline soil conditions at Port au Choix have combined to preserve a time capsule of great historical importance. Because of the cultural significance of this burial site, and a successful local lobby, the site was officially designated a National Historic Site in 1970. In 2001, Parks Canada constructed a new Visitor Centre and Museum dedicated to the rich history of these native people - the first ever to inhabit Newfoundland, dating back over 5000 years. = Basque chaloupe= The chaloupe at Port au Choix In 2004, through the effort of the 2004 Society, an association of Basque Maritime Heritage, Itsas Begia (The eye of the sea) from Ciboure (Northern Basque Country), came to Newfoundland and shared its ancestral knowledge with Newfoundlanders. Three chaloupes were built, here in Port au Choix, in Conche and in La Scie. The chaloupe is located on Forest Road, in the old Port au Choix cove.

Born to Dutch parents, jhr. Hendrik Barthout van Tets, heer van Goidschalxoord and Thérèse van Heukelom, in London on 19 January 1929, Van Tets spent his childhood in the Netherlands. Following World War II, he moved to England to complete his schooling at Hazelmere. He completed two years of national service with the Royal Engineers in England and Austria before emigrating to Canada where he studied at the University of Toronto (1952–54) and the University of British Columbia (1954-1963), obtaining his PhD in 1963. He became a member of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1958. In November 1963, he married Patricia Anne Johnston in Vancouver, British Columbia, moving shortly thereafter to Australia, where he joined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in the Division of Wildlife and Ecology, now the Division of Sustainable Ecosystems. Van Tets swam for the swimming teams of British Troops Austria, the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia. Van Tets received recognition for his studies on bird strike damage to aircraft, and later for his studies of the bird bones in the Australian National Wildlife Collection, including those of the extinct Tasman booby which he described scientifically in 1988, and became a specialist authority on the mutton bird and the cormorant family. Together with Michael Crowley, Chris Davey, Peter Fullagar, Ederic Slater, Petrus Heyligers and others, Van Tets helped to establish and maintain a long term ecological study on Montague Island, NSW. Van Tets served as compiler for the first four bird (Aves) volumes of the Zoological Catalogue of Australia and as a sub-editor for behaviour for the first three volumes of the Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds. On retirement in 1988, Van Tets continued to work as a research fellow and as curator of osteology for the Australian National Wildlife Collection and the Faunal Reference Collection of the Prehistory Department of the Australian National University. He died in Canberra, Australia on 14 January 1995. Van Tets was survived by his wife and three children, Janet Bradly, Ian van TetsUAA faculty staff Ian van Tets and Kit Cassidy. The extinct New Zealand stiff-tailed duck, Oxyura vantetsi, was named in his honour. The Gerard Frederick van Tets Field Research Station on Montague Island, NSW was named in recognition of Jerry's work there. Selected publications *Tets, G F van, 1994.

It is located on the northwest side of Conception Bay and consists of Vokey's Shore, Northern Cove, Mint Cove, Green Head, and Goddenville. The name Spaniard's Bay came from the Basque and Portuguese fishermen who frequented the port in the 16th century and 17th century, and were referred to by the English as ‘Spaniards’. Occupation of the area was seasonal at first, as with most of Newfoundland, but gradually English fishermen began to make permanent homes in Spaniard's Bay around 1776. American Traders were visiting Spaniard's Bay before 1776 and they exchanged salt, rum, and tobacco for cod. By 1805, there were 400 people living in the area and according to the 1871 Lovell's Directory, the population would rise to 1,182 in less than seventy years. The majority of the settlers were English and had Dorset origin, but there was a strong Irish population. By the end of 1991, the population would be close to 2,200. The initial settlement at Spaniard's Bay centred on Mint Cove and Northern Cove. Some of the people living in Mint Cove before 1800 were Jonathan Sheppard, John Warford, Timothy Collins, and William Chipman. William Gosse and Robert Gosse, Jr. had a dockyard in Northern Cove in 1790, while Thomas Noseworthy and William Porter were living at Green Head in 1796. The Smith and Barrett families occupied Bread and Cheese Cove (Bishop's Cove), with the Smiths claiming to have been in possession of the land since 1625. There were 400 people in 38 families occupying 36 registered properties in Spaniard's Bay. Some of the family names included Peddle, Kelly, Neil, Besom, Brown, Forter, Phelan, Seymour, Vokey, Butt, Baggs, Baker, and Menchions. Recently the new family name of Cutler has been added to the list of Spaniard's Bay settlers, originating from the Kleinburg region of Southern Ontario. There is a site at Spaniard's Bay listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places; the Mark Gosse Residence, number 6039.

The once predominantly rural area has developed into a suburban bedroom community in recent years as the city of Abilene has expanded southward. A significant portion of Wylie now lies within the city limits of Abilene, although a few areas often associated with the community are located outside of the city and remain unincorporated. Though much of Wylie is now located within the far southern portion of Abilene, the area has retained a distinct identity through its school system, the Wylie Independent School District. Geography Wylie is located about 5 miles southwest of downtown Abilene along FM 89 (Buffalo Gap Road) in the northeastern portion of Taylor County. Wylie is part of the Abilene, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Taylor, Jones, and Callahan Counties.  History Wylie was named after J. J. Wylie, an early settler, who moved Taylor County in 1880. The first settlers farmed in the Wylie area beginning 1881, Wylie as a community did not develop until 1902, when John H. Vance arrived from Austin, Texas. Vance purchased several acres of land southwest of Abilene, and built the first general store. Vance included a residence attached at the back for his family. The structure was located on the southwest corner of what is now the intersection of Buffalo Gap Road and Antilley Road. The store was known as Vances Corner. That same year with the population growing, residents went to Mary V. Wylie, widow of J. J. Wylie, for assistance with a school and church. Mary donated land across the road to the north of the Vance store. The Wylie school district was designated in 1888, but records indicate that the school did not operate until 1902. In 1902, three prominent citizens contributed $120 apiece for the purchase of materials, and several residents got together to build a building for use as both a school and a church. In 1904, John Vance installed a post office in his store and named it Sambo, for \\"Brother Sam\\", his good friend and neighbor Sam Little. The Sambo post office operated from December 1904 until February 1912, when Abilene began rural postal delivery. By 1915, the student population outgrew its current building. In her donation of land, Mrs. Wylie stipulated that the name of the school be changed to Wylie, in honor of her late husband. The citizens accepted her terms and voted for a $3,000 bond issue. A two-story plank building was constructed in 1916 and named Wylie School. Between 1950 and 1986, Wylie's population more than tripled due to the tremendous growth in southwest Abilene. In the 1980s, land development caused property valuations to increase more than ten-fold. This growth brought affluent subdivisions such as the Fairway Oaks Country Club and the Mall of Abilene to the area. Education Wylie is served by the Wylie Independent School District (ISD). The district also serves southern Abilene, the communities of Potosi, Caps, and View, and unincorporated areas in north- central Taylor County. Wylie ISD has six schools - Wylie Early Childhood Center (prekindergarten and kindergarten), Wylie Elementary School (grades 1-2), Wylie Intermediate School (grades 3-4), Wylie Middle School (grades 5-6), Wylie Junior High School (grades 7-8), and Wylie High School (grades 9-12). The district's mascot is the Bulldog.

Career Franken, the son of a Hollywood press agent, was born in Brooklyn, New York and graduated from Cornell University in 1953. His first screen role was in 1958 as \\"Willie\\" in the episode \\"The Time of Your Life\\" on the CBS anthology series, Playhouse 90. Another early role was as \\"Bully\\" in the 1961 episode \\"The Pit\\" of the ABC western series, The Rebel, starring Nick Adams. He played the lead guest-starring role in the 1961 episode \\"The Case of Willie Betterley\\" in the crime drama, Lock Up. In 1962, he was cast as Dunc Tomilson in \\"The Yacht-Club Gang\\" on the CBS crime drama, Checkmate. He appeared as Jerry Allen in two episodes of the NBC education drama, Mr. Novak. In 1964, he appeared the SciFi B movie, The Time Travelers. In 1965 he appeared in a McHale's Navy episode \\"Birth of a Salesman\\". Producer Rod Amateau saw him in a Los Angeles stage production of Say, Darling, and cast him as playboy dilettante Chatsworth Osborne Jr., on the CBS sitcom, The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, starring Dwayne Hickman. Franken appeared as a recurring guest in numerous episodes beginning midway through the first season and continuing through the fourth and final season, from 1960 to 1963. He attributed the character's look of pained condescension to an ulcer he himself had suffered since the age of fourteen, when his own mother had died. He appeared in 1963 on Petticoat Junction as the son of the villain, Homer Bedlow, played by Charles Lane. Feeling typecast, Franken sought out villainous roles, but played another rich wastrel on the short-lived sitcom Tom, Dick and Mary, and went on to a long career as a television and film character actor.

The series script was written by famed GO author Kazuki Kaneshiro and marks his first time writing for a television drama. The drama centers on a newly recruited SP officer named Kaoru Inoue, who is the only SP officer known in the force to have sharp senses that enables him to conduct his duties by using this ESP sense to take down the threat before it appears to threaten the VIP and the civilians who are caught in the middle. The franchise consists of the TV series, two film adaptations of the series released in 2010 and 2011 with a manga adaptation. Plot Kaoru Inoue had suffered a tragedy when his parents were killed by a knife-wielding man in the political rally of Assemblyman Yūzō Asada in Tokyo when he was 6. Because of this, all of his senses have been improved with the ability to detect anything in his surroundings ranging from telling who is an assassin and who is a civilian while being able to tell important details such as having photographic and tracking abilities. Veteran SP officer Sōichirō Ogata recruits him from SP training after being impressed with his training under Section 4 of the SP division. Inoue works with Eri Sasamoto, one of the few women serving in the division. Another officer is Takafumi Yamamoto, who is the only known SP officer to have MMA experience with a preference to use the 7:3 hairstyle ratio. Mitsuo Ishida is the only known SP officer in the section who had been previously married. Together, these men and women work in unison to protect the VIPs assigned to them from being killed by assassins. But when the team is assigned to protect Asada, now the Prime Minister of Japan, Inoue begins to have nightmares relating to the tragedy while Ogata strives to ensure his safety while having some secrets of his own aside from Inoue.

The name referred to an eight-sided polyhedral die common in such games. Unlike other gaming magazines, d8’s focus was not on gaming systems and rules, but rather the art of role playing and the cultural, pop-cultural, and subcultural interests of the people who played games. d8 styled itself “the magazine of role-playing culture”. This editorial mission was conceived of by Founder and Creative Director David DeCheser. The magazine was financed by Frank Slattery IV, an avid gamer who wanted to be involved in the field. Contributors Edited by Holly Black and Joe Cirillo, the magazine had a host of eclectic and regular contributors that included author Steve Berman, GWAR member Hunter Jackson, illustrators Joseph Hasenauer and Theo Black, Yamara creators Barbara Manui and Chris Adams, and former Shadis editor Jolly R. Blackburn. Articles on LARPs were placed side-by-side with interviews with comic book artists such as Dave McKean, reviews of authentic medieval restaurants, and caffeinated tips on how to game all night. One of d8’s stand-out regular features was its fashion spread which, coordinated by stylist Deanna Stull and photographed by Director of Photography Michael Amper, showcased shoots that included renaissance garb, neo-gothic vampires in latex, and leather plated armor. The magazine is credited as introducing Holly Black to artist Tony DiTerlizzi, who would later go on to co-author The Spiderwick Chronicles. Black’s first published work, \\"Ahremon/City of the Sun: Garden of Ghosts\\", appeared in the second issue of d8. At that time she was writing under the name Holly Riggenbach. Art direction and graphic style The magazine was both highly praised and criticized for its graphic design. The design was very influenced by then-famous Ray Gun designer David Carson, and the “grunge” style typefaces being produced by font foundries such as T26. Critics cited the grid-less expressive design as difficult to read. Conversely the design is what attracted the less traditional, more alternative artistic contributors that Creative Director David DeCheser sought, such as: Dave McKean, Eric Dinyer, and John K. Snyder III. Public Relations & Marketing Managed internally by Deanna Stull, quirky internal advertisements for subscriptions and a raw marketing style well suited the industry. Launched at a time when collectible card games such as Magic: The Gathering were infiltrating the gaming market, d8’s audience proved to be too niche to continue past its fourteen-month run. It was successful however in attracting a cross-over audience of fans of gothic subculture.

Plot Dermot O'Neill (Robert Mitchum) is recruited into the Irish Republican Army (IRA) when a unit is formed in his Northern Ireland town during the Second World War. Reaction to the news is mixed. His mother is strongly against it, while his father (Harry Brogan) is proud. His brother Ned (Niall MacGinnis) and sister Bella (Marianne Benet) are ambivalent. Dermot's girlfriend, Neeve Donnelly (Anne Heywood), breaks up with him, telling him the IRA will turn him into a murderer. Dermot and his friend Sean Reilly (Richard Harris) are chosen from their unit to participate in a raid on a British armoury to steal weapons and ammunition. Don McGinnis (Dan O'Herlihy) is frustrated because, as commandant of the unit, he is too important to risk. The theft goes off without a hitch. However, their next attack, to destroy a guarded power plant in concert with a planned German invasion, results in bloodshed. To get away, Dermot shoots a soldier blocking the way out. Sean is wounded in the foot and Johnny Corrigan is killed. Dermot and Sean evade their pursuers and manage to cross the border to safety in the Republic of Ireland. Dermot returns home, leaving his friend to recuperate. Despite Dermot's advice to stay away, Sean tries to sneak back across the border and is captured by the police. Dermot wants to stage a rescue, but McGinnis turns him down. Sean is sentenced to ten years imprisonment. McGinnis decides to get revenge by attacking a police barracks. Dermot opposes this plan, as a policeman's wife and children are living there, and warns that he will tell the authorities if McGinnis does not change his mind. When the commandant refuses to back down, Dermot tells McGinnis he is quitting the IRA. He is beaten up, but a police patrol comes upon the scene before the IRA members can do anything more drastic. Dermot carries through on his threat, telling Sergeant Crawley (Geoffrey Golden), though without naming names. He is abducted to stand trial as an informant. Bella becomes concerned when her brother does not come home. She goes to Neeve. The two then consult Dermot's good friend, cobbler Jimmy Hannafin (Cyril Cusack). Jimmy has a pretty good idea what has happened. He gets Ned to help in the rescue. Neeve refuses to be left behind, but Bella is sent home to reassure her parents. Once they find and free Dermot, guarded only by youngster Quinn (Wilfred Downing), Jimmy arranges for a friend to give Dermot a ride to Belfast, where he can leave the country. Neeve goes with him. Meanwhile, the IRA men start searching for him. McGinnis stations himself at the O'Neill home. In the darkness and driving rain, he mistakes the returning Bella (wearing Dermot's coat) for the fugitive and shoots her dead. He is horrified to discover that he has killed the woman he loves.

The Hamoodur Rahman Commission (otherwise known as War Enquiry Commission), was a judicial inquiry commission that assessed Pakistan's political–military involvement in East-Pakistan from 1947 to 1971. The commission was set up on 26 December 1971 by the Government of Pakistan and chaired under a Bengali Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman. Constituted \\"to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the atrocities and 1971 war\\", including the \\"circumstances in which the Commander of the Eastern Military Command, surrendered the Eastern contingent forces under his command laid down their arms.\\" The commission's final report was very lengthy and provided an analysis based extensive interviews and testimonies. Its primary conclusion was very critical of the role of Pakistan's military interference, the misconduct of politicians as well as the intelligence failures of the Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), which permitted the infiltration of Indian agents all along the borders of East Pakistan. Originally, there were 12 copies of the report. These were all destroyed; except the one that was handed over to Government who disallowed its publication at the time. In 2000, parts of the commission report were leaked to Indian and Pakistani newspapers. The full report was thought to be declassified by the government in 2000, along with other reports concerning the year of 1971. However, it was reported that the supplementary report based on testimonies of POWs was published, and the key portion of the report concerning the political and military issues remained classified and marked as \\"Top secret.\\" Historical background=Formation of Commissions= In 1971, the war between India and Pakistan witnessed the liberation of East- Pakistan, which ended with the signing of the Instrument of Surrender with the Indian Army in Dhaka. Upon consolidating the power, President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto announced to form the Commission under the Supreme Court's senior justices in December 1971. Constituted upon the request from the President, the Commission conducted evaluated and analytical studies to inquire into and find out \\"the circumstances in which the Commander, Eastern Command, surrendered and the members of the Armed Forces of Pakistan under his command laid down their arms and a ceasefire was ordered along the borders of West Pakistan and India and along the ceasefire line in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\\" Initially, the commission was known as War Enquiry Commission but gained notability as \\"Hamoodur Rehman Commission\\" across the country. The commission was led by its chairman, Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman (a Bengali jurist), aided with the senior justices of the Supreme Court, and military officials as its advisers.Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report , Pakistan Peoples Party The commission had consisted of both civilian and military officials that investigated the political and military failures based on the interviews and testimonies provided by the POWs, politicians, activists, military leaders, and journalists for two years. The Commission submitted its final report in 1974. =Commission members= * Supreme Court of Pakistan ** Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman (Chairman) ** Senior Justice Anwarul Haq (Vice Chairman) ** Senior Justice Tufail Rahman (Chief Justice of Sindh High Court) ** Two additional members from Baluchistan High Court ** Lieutenant-General (retired) Altaf Qadir was its military adviser. =Interviewees and testimonies (1972–74)= The Commission interviewed and stored testimonies in both first and supplementary reports. In 1972, it was reported that around 213 officials were interviewed and testified, including Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In 1974, the Commission again resumed its work and interviewed 300 freed POWs and recorded 73 more bureaucrats' testimonies that served on government assignments in East Pakistan. *Yahya Khan (1972) *Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1972) *Abdul Hamid Khan(1972) *Gul Hasan (1972) *A.O.

In July 1972, President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto reviewed the First report submitted by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman. The Commission interviewed 213 persons of interest that included former president Yahya Khan, Nurul Amin, Abdul Hamid Khan (Chief of Army), Abdul Rahim Khan (Chief of Air Force), Muzaffar Hassan (Chief of Navy), Bhutto, senior commanders, activists, journalists, and various political leaders. The Commission considered this initial report as \\"tentative\\" as it had not been able to interview many key people who were at that time POWs in India. The Commission stated: \\"our observations and conclusions regarding the surrender in East Pakistan and other allied matters should be regarded as provisional and subject to modification in the light of the evidence of the Commander, Eastern Command, and his senior officers as and when such evidence becomes available.\\" Initially, the commission interviewed 213 people and made 12 copies of the report. One of the copies was given to President Bhutto and the rest were either destroyed or were stolen. The first report recognized the atrocities and systematic massacre at the Dhaka University which eventually led to recommendations of holding public trials for civilian bureaucrats and field courts-martial for the senior staff officers. It is theorized that the first report is very critical of Pakistan military's interference in politics and misconduct of politicians in country's political atmosphere. The first report also made many insightful recommendations for reorganizing the military physicals, tradition, and their syllabus and training agenda as well as promoting the sense of democratization environment in the political system of the country. The first report is never published and kept as highly classified documents because of its potentially adverse effects on the military's (at that time) low-institutional morale and fear of a backlash. The Government and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto himself maintained that the first report was classified to \\"save its [the military's] honor\\". Supplementary report In 1974, the Commission reopened its enquiry offering an opportunity to the prisoners of war who had been freed by India and Bangladesh by then and others repatriated from East Pakistan to furnish such information as might be within their knowledge and relevant to the purposes of the commission. Commission held an informal meeting at Lahore on 3 June 1974 to consider various preliminary matters and then decided to resume proceedings at Abbottabad from 16 July 1974. After the investigation resumed in 1974 the commission interviewed with seventy–three more East Pakistani bureaucrats and high-ranked military personnel. The Commission examined nearly 300 witnesses in total, hundreds of classified documents and military signals between East and West Pakistan. The supplementary report is heavily based on testimonies provided by the returning POWs and their families but held the military responsible for the atrocities committed in East Pakistan in 1971. The Commission endorsed the Pakistan's claim that: Families of West Pakistani officials in East Pakistan were subjected to inhumane treatment by their Bengali colleagues. Returning Western Pakistanis and the Biharis told the Commission of awful tales of the atrocities committed at the hands of the Awami League militants– the Mukti Bahini. The final report, also called supplementary report, was submitted on 23 October 1974, showed how political, administrative, military and moral failings were responsible for the surrender of Pakistani forces in East Pakistan. It remained classified and it contents were guessed from the revealing of different military officers. The report was organized into Five Chapters and an annexure. # Chapter One – The Moral Aspect # Chapter Two – Alleged atrocities by the Pakistan Army # Chapter Three – Professional Responsibilities of Certain Senior Army Commanders # Chapter Four – Conclusions # Chapter Five – Recommendations =Findings= In 1971, Pakistan fought the war with India at two different fronts. China and Burma also visible. The commission challenged the claims by Bangladeshi authorities that 3,000,000 Bengalis had been killed by the Pakistani military and 200,000 women were raped. The commission put the casualty figure as low as 26,000 civilian casualties. Although these references were not verified thoroughly and more seems like a conspiracy and tales.Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report , chapter 2 , paragraph 33 The issue is controversial; the independent figures noted that around ~269,000 people (both Bengali and Western Pakistanis) perished prior to the military intervention by Pakistan. Volume I of the supplementary report dealt with the political background, international relations, and military aspects of the events in 1971. The supplementary report discussed its findings in the light of political events in 1971, military aspects, surrender in East Pakistan and the aspects in morality. The Commission found that when the tales of slaughtering of Western Pakistanis reached to Pakistani soldiers stationed in East, they reacted violently, and in the process of restoring the authority of the Government, committed severe excesses on the local Bengali population. Both the first and the supplementary report's findings accused the Pakistan Army of carrying out the senseless and wanton arson, killings in the countryside, killing of intellectuals and professionals and burying them in mass graves, killing of officers of East Pakistan Army and soldiers on the pretence of quelling their rebellion, killing East Pakistani civilian officers, businessmen and industrialists, raping a large number of East Pakistani women as a deliberate act of revenge, retaliation and torture, and deliberate killing of members of the Hindu minority. The report accused the army generals of what it called a \\"premature surrender\\" and said the military's continued involvement in running the government after 1958 was one reason for the corruption and ineffectiveness of senior officers. The report maintained that: \\"Even responsible service officers have asserted before us that because of corruption resulting from such involvement, the lust for wine and women and greed for lands and houses, a large number of senior army officers, particularly those occupying the highest positions, had lost not only their will to fight but also their professional competence.\\"Local Elections in Pakistan Are First Vote Since 1999 Coup, The New York Times, 2001-01-01 The report said Pakistan's military ruler at the time, General Yahya Khan, who stepped down after Pakistan's defeat in December 1971, \\"permitted and even instigated\\" the surrender, and it recommended that he be publicly tried along with other senior military colleagues. The report accused General Yahya Khan, of being a womanizer and an alcoholic. According to the report \\"Firm and proper action would not only satisfy the nation's demand for punishment where it is deserved, but would also ensure against any future recurrence of the kind of shameful conduct displayed during the 1971 war\\". =Recommendations= Many insightful recommendations were made by the commission as it recommends to hold the public trial for the President General Yahya Khan, also the Commander-in-Chief and the chief martial law administrator of both East and Pakistan in western side. The Commission found suitable for field Courts-martial for Lieutenant-General Abdul Hamid Khan, Lieutenant-General Gul Hasan, Lieutenant-General SSGM Prizada and Major- General Khudadad Khan, and Major-General A. O. Mitha should be publicly tried for being party to a criminal conspiracy to illegally usurp power from Mohammad Ayub Khan in power if necessary by the use of force. Five additional Lieutenant-Generals and three Brigadier-Generals were recommended to be tried for willful neglect of duty. These were Lieutenant-Generals included A.A.K. Nazi, Mohammad Jamshed, M. Rahim Khan, Irshad Ahmad Khan, B.M. Mustafa and Brigadier-Generals G.M. Baquir Siddiqui, Mohammad Hayat and Mohammad Aslam Niazi. According to the Commission General Mustafa's offensive plan aimed at the capture of the Indian position of Ramgarh in the Rajasthan area (Western Front) was militarily unsound and haphazardly planned, and its execution resulted in severe loss of vehicles and equipment in the desert. In the supplementary report section in \\"Higher Direction of War act\\" of the HRC report, it strongly called for the establishment of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) mechanism with headquartered in MoD. Per the act, the JCSC composed of a chairman, the Chief of Naval Staff, the Chief of Army Staff, and the Chief of Air Staff. It was mandate to have a collective responsibility of national defence and mechanism of plans based on a joint objectives. The chairmanship was to be rotated between each inter-services, irrespective of the personal ranks in each service. The commission also stressed for the need of stronger deterrence of the country against the foreign intrusions and makes more thoughtful recommendations about the defense of the country as a whole. The Commission called for restoring the rule of law according to the Constitution and establishing the writ of government through the Constitution. In the end, the commission opined in the report that the nation would learn the necessary lessons from these tragic events, and that effective and early action will be taken in the light of the conclusions reached. Aftermath The supplementary report was submitted by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman to Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on 23 October 1974. Bhutto classified the report because, according to journalist Salil Tripathi, he was concerned that it would demoralize the military and might trigger unrest therein. In 1976, Rahman asked Bhutto what was being done about the report. Bhutto replied that the report was missing; it was either lost, or stolen, and was nowhere to be found. Upon hearing the fate of the report, Chief Justice Rahman asked the Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq for the apprehension of the report who also commented that the original report is nowhere to be found, and nobody knows where the report actually went missing– either at the Army GHQ or the National Archives of Pakistan. In 1990s, the curiosity over the report grew with the News International revealing that the report was suppressed and was held secretly at the Joint Staff HQ in Rawalpindi. Contents of the report were published by the Dawn and the India Today and rumored to be the first report, in August 2000. However, it was revealed that this was the supplementary report that was presumably published.Behind Pakistan's Defeat, India Today, 2000-08-21Gen Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan - 4, Dawn, 2000-09-17 Soon after the revelation, the India Today willfully suppressed its own publications as if the surrender was its own scandal. No action was ever taken based on the report, the report was classified and its publication disallowed at the time. Yahya Khan died in 1980, but some of his key colleagues were living in retirement on pensions as of 2000. Tikka Khan, A.A.K. Niazi, and Rao Farman Ali all died in 2004. Trials of Gul Hassan, Abdul Rahim Khan, and Muzaffar Hassan were the only trials held by the Judge Advocate General in the light of the Hamoodur Rahman Commission in 1972. President Pervez Musharraf reportedly commented in October 2000 that the incidents in 1971 were a political as well as a military debacle, and that calls for the military generals to be tried were not fair. Subsequently, Bangladesh requested a copy of the report.Bangladesh requests war report, BBC News, 2000-08-30 In December 2000, 29 years after the inquiry was completed, the War Report was finally declassified in Pakistan by President Musharraf.Pakistan declassifies 1971 war report, BBC News, 2000-12-31 However, it was revealed to be an official supplementary report that was declassified, not the first report.

Because of its proximity to Devils Lake, it has been impacted with the lake's increasing elevation; portions in and along the lake have had to be raised at least once to get the road elevation above the lake level. Despite this, the route remains vulnerable to flooding. Route description ND 57 begins at an intersection with US 281 in Benson County and starts east toward Fort Totten along a two- lane road. A few miles east of this intersection, the route turns northeast and enters Fort Totten. After leaving Fort Totten, ND 57 crosses Devils Lake for the first time, entering the White Horse Hill National Game Preserve upon returning to land, but leaving the preserve shortly after. The route continues to travel east, curving along the shore of the lake until reaching a small island that is home to a casino.

Early life and career Born in Appenzell, Switzerland, Signer started his career as an artist later in life at the age of 28, after working as an architect’s draughtsman, a radio engineer apprentice, and a short stint in a pressure cooker factory. He holds degrees from arts institutions in Switzerland and Poland. He studied at the Schule für Gestaltung in Zurich and Lucerne between 1966 and 1971. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Poland from 1971-1972.https://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/2805-roman- signer Work \\"Boot Fountain\\" in Solothurn Der Tisch in Appenzell Signer's work has grown out of, and has affinities with both land art and performance art, but they are not typically representative of either category.Roman Signer: Works, 2 November 2007 – 27 January 2008 The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh. It is often being described as following the tradition of the Swiss engineer-artist, such as Jean Tinguely and Peter Fischli & David Weiss.Roman Signer Skulptur Projekte Münster. Signer’s \\"action sculptures\\" involve setting up, carrying out, and recording \\"experiments\\" or events that bear aesthetic results. Day-to-day objects such as umbrellas, tables, boots, containers, hats and bicycles are part of Signer’s working vocabulary. Following carefully planned and strictly executed and documented procedures, the artist enacts and records such acts as explosions, collisions, and the projection of objects through space. Signer advocates ‘controlled destruction, not destruction for its own sake’.Jakob Neulinger, (10 December 2008), Roman Signer at Galerie Martin Janda, Vienna, Austria Frieze Magazine. Action Kurhaus Weissbad (1992) saw chairs catapulted out of a hotel’s windows; Table (1994) launched a table into the sea on four buckets; Kayak (2000) featured the artist being towed down a road in a canoe. In documenta 8 (1987), he catapulted thousands of sheets of paper into the air to create an ephemeral wall in the room for a brief, but all the more intense moment. As the Swiss representative at the Venice Biennale in 1999, he made 117 steel balls fall from the ceiling on to lumps of clay lying on the ground. https://bombmagazine.org/articles/roman- signer/ Many of his happenings are not for public viewing, and are only documented in photos and film.Roman Signer – Four Rooms, One Artist Swiss Institute, New York. Video works like Stiefel mit Rakete (Boot with Rocket) are integral to Signer’s performances, capturing the original setup of materials that self-destruct in the process of creating an emotionally and visually compelling event. Signer gives a humorous twist to the concept of cause and effect and to the traditional scientific method of experimentation and discovery, taking on the self-evidence of scientific logic as an artistic challenge. As well as working in his studio, which he calls his lab, Signer often takes off to the Swiss mountains to conduct larger experiments.Roman Signer – Four Rooms, One Artist Swiss Institute, New York. A recent example of his installation work was \\"Accident as sculpture\\" (Unfall als Skulptur)(2008) in which Signer had a three-wheeled delivery car, loaded with water barrels, roll down an 11 m high ramp and up the other side. At the apex, the vehicle overturned and crashed to the ground. The resulting chaotic arrangement constituted the exhibition at :de:Kunstraum Dornbirn. \\"Accident as sculpture\\" (Unfall als Skulptur) at Kunstraum Dornbirn, Austria (2008) (German) Another example, the video 56 Small Helicopters (56 Kleine Helikopter) (2008) shows a squadron of 56 remote-controlled toy helicopters as they rise into the air, collide with each other, carom off the ceiling and walls, and finally die in mechanical spasms on the floor.Roman Signer: 56 Small Helicopters (56 Kleine Helikopter), September 2 – October 30, 2011 Smith Museum of Art, Smith College. In 2011, Signer showed Restenfilme or film leftovers, always presented in a darkened room furnished with several rows of wooden chairs, one of which rocks unassisted on its back legs. The projection gathers actions, which Signer never constituted as full artworks, as well as shots of locations that were possible staging grounds for potential works.Cinema - Roman Signer, March 25, 2011 - April 30, 2011 MERCER UNION - A Centre for Contemporary Art, Toronto.

Exhibitions  Signer's work has been shown at galleries and museums in Europe, North America and Asia over the last thirty years. It was featured in 37th Venice Biennale (1976), documenta 8, Kassel (1987), and Skulptur Projekte Münster (1997)Roman Signer Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh. In 2016 the Kunstmuseum Basel acquired 205 films of Roman Signer in Super 8 format. These films are among the most important works that make Signer's early performative work accessible. From April 1, 2017, 24 films from this collection will be presented to the public on 12 screens connecting the main building and the new building. The films shown were all produced between 1975 and 1989 and show the partial spectacular actions for which the artist has become known. No movie is longer than three minutes. Without sound, they show themes that are drawn by Signer's entire oeuvre: explosions and poetic moments, nature and its elements, staging and coincidence. Not infrequently the artist himself appears in it. They are sculptures on time, which sometimes offer a surprise effect and often reveal a humorous, almost slapsticky side. =Selected solo shows= * 2015 Barbican Centre London, 'Slow Movement' * 2012 Kunsthalle Mainz * 2009 Kunsthaus Zug, Roman Signer - Werke 1975-2007 * 2009 Hamburger Kunsthalle, Roman Signer - Projektionen.

He is also known for developing numerous buildings and transportation lines in Philadelphia and St. Petersburg, Florida. Philadelphia Gandy was born in the Tuckahoe section of Upper Township, New Jersey. His father was a ship captain.Hartzell 2002, p. 68. Gandy dropped out of grammar school and made money writing wedding invitations. The family moved to Philadelphia and, at age 16, Gandy earned $4 per week working as an office boy at Henry Disston & Sons. After 11 years, Gandy climbed to a top position with Disston launching his impressive career. He married Henry Disston's daughter, Mary, who died at the age of 26 in 1876. Disston Memorial Church, on Tyson Avenue, in Philadelphia's Tacony section, is named for Mary. In 1882, he became secretary and treasurer of Frankford and Southwark Railway Company.Grismer. At age 35, Gandy began suffering from a heart condition which lasted the rest of his life and was occasionally aggravated by his business dealings.Hartzell 2002, p. 69. He worked as an executive for several companies in Philadelphia, building more than 200 residences and the People's Theatre. Gandy's passion however was transportation and, by the end of the 19th century, he had built of trolley lines in Philadelphia. In the 1890s, he spearheaded efforts to connect Willow Grove Park to Philadelphia, making the park a popular attraction. St. Petersburg In 1903, Gandy followed fellow Philadelphian trolley entrepreneur, F. A. Davis, to St. Petersburg, Florida, leading several of Davis's companies including St. Petersburg's trolley system. Gandy and Davis eventually parted ways and Gandy settled permanently in St. Petersburg with his wife and five children in 1912. That year, he purchased land downtown and built La Plaza Theatre and office buildings. The plaza was criticized by many as \\"Gandy's White Elephant\\" but it soon made hefty profits and silenced the critics.Burnett, p. 6. The $150,000 theatre drew such attractions as John Philip Sousa's band and the controversial landmark film The Birth of a Nation. In 1910, Gandy began discussion with fellow entrepreneur H. Walter Fuller regarding the best route for a bridge across Old Tampa Bay. Gandy formed a company called the Gandy Bridge Company and, in 1915, decided on a final route. Gandy and Fuller were partners until Fuller sold his share for $500 after declaring bankruptcy in 1918.Hartzell 2006, p. 73. Within a few years, he had obtained right-of-way at either end of the bridge but needed to garner support for the rights over the bay itself.Burnett, pp. 6-7. After obtaining the backing of numerous local businessmen as well as both U.S. Senator Duncan U. Fletcher and U.S. Representative Herbert J. Drane, Gandy's plans were finally approved by the Department of War on February 11, 1918.Burnett, pp. 6-7. Financing for the bridge stalled, however, due in part to Gandy's refusal to spend his own considerable savings.Burnett, p. 7. In September 1922, Gandy hired a team to sell stock in the bridge and, after $2 million was raised in only 122 days, construction began in 1923.Burnett, p. 8. When Florida Governor Cary A. Hardee ceremonially opened the bridge on November 20, 1924, it was the longest over-water highway in the world. At the dedication, Gandy's entire speech was four words: \\"The bridge is built!\\"Gandy Bridge 1930 at the historic photos section of the Florida Department of Transportation web site. Late life and legacy Despite his heart condition, Gandy lived another 22 years after his bridge was completed. He lost his sight while in his 80s but continued being chauffeured to his office. Gandy died at age 95 and was interred at Royal Palm South Cemetery in St. Petersburg.George S Gandy at Find A Grave. Gandy's legacy was continued by his son, George S. Gandy, Jr., who founded the famous St. Petersburg-Habana Sailboat Race, which was discontinued in 1959 upon the rise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. The race will be revived in 2017 after the newly reunited Cuban-American relations. Gandy's La Plaza Theatre was acquired by Florida State Theaters in 1948 and demolished in 1957.Deese p. 87. The Gandy Bridge was replaced in 1956, expanded in 1976, and expanded again in 1996. A non-automobile section of the bridge has been left intact as \\"The Friendship Trail Bridge,\\" part of the Pinellas Trail. The area in Pinellas County where the Gandy Bridge connects is now a census-designated place called Gandy, Florida. The roads leading to either end of the bridge, including part of State Road 694 in Pinellas County, are called Gandy Boulevard.

He was elected as a member of the Queensland Parliament, and was later to become a judge and also the Chief Justice of Queensland. He was the son of a prominent Queensland politician, and he was elected as a member of parliament. He served as a judge from 1926, until his appointment as chief justice in 1940 and his death later that year. He is unique in Queensland history as the shortest serving chief justice, serving only one month, and one of only two chief justice to have a brother and nephew served as chief justice. Early years Macrossan was born at Lutwyche, now a suburb of Brisbane. His parents, John Murtagh Macrossan and Bridget Macrossan (née Queely), were both Irish émigrés to Australia who had married in Australia. Macrossan's father was a prominent member of the Queensland Parliament. Macrossan was educated at St. Joseph's Nudgee College in Brisbane. He later attended the University of Sydney and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1902. Before embarking on his career in politics and the law, he worked as a teacher in Nudgee for three years. Political career Macrossan obtained a taste for the law when he worked as an associate for Mr Justice Patrick Real of the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1904. He was admitted to the Queensland Bar on 22 October 1907 and practiced as a barrister thereafter. His first foray into politics occurred in 1910. He stood as a Liberal candidate for the Senate in the Australian Parliament in that year. He was not successful and he returned to practice in the law. On 12 June 1912, he married Lydia Cremin Hall Woodhouse at St Patrick's Church in Sydney. He tried again to enter into politics. He was nominated to stand as a Ministerial candidate for the seat of Windsor in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, the lower house of the Queensland Parliament.Serle, Percival, \\"Dictionary of Australian Biography\\" At that time, the parliament was bicameral. This time he was elected.Queensland Parliament History page During his time in politics, he became disillusioned with the parliamentary party system and he urged politicians not to vote along party lines. He had little success in doing this. In the 1915 election he refused to be nominated for his former party. Instead, he ran as an Independent Liberal candidate. He lost his seat in that election to the candidate for the Australian Labor Party. He returned to the Bar and became a leading member of it. He appeared in a number of leading Australian cases, including the constitutional case of Mooraberrie Cattle caseDuncan v Queensland (1916) 22 CLR 556 At the swearing in of Thomas William McCawley as a judge of the Supreme Court, Macrossan was one of the few judges to argue that McCawley's commission as a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland was valid. That issue went to the High Court of Australia and later to the Privy Council which determined that the appointment of McCawley was valid. It was during his time at the bar that his first wife Lydia died in 1922. Judicial career Macrossan was sworn in as a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland on 23 July 1926. He became senior puisne judge on 1 December 1926. The following day, he married Gladys Mildred Trenfield at Fortitude Valley. They separated 10 years later. In 1929, Pope Pius XI appointed Macrossan a Knight of St Gregory the Great. Macrossan had a \\"tongue of silver and steel\\" and was noted for his hard work and speedy judgments. Unfortunately, his wit was not always appreciated. In hearing a divorce suit between two unmarried people who were living together as a married couple, Macrossan remarked \\"I suppose they will go and get married and spoil it all\\". Unfortunately for Macrossan, two ministers heard his remark and wrote a letter of complaint to the local paper protesting at the judge's comments about the institution of marriage. Macrossan took the letter as being a contempt of court by the ministers as well as the newspaper, and he duly convicted each of them. An appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court overturned the convictions for contempt.14 University of Queensland Law Journal 147 (1985-1987) \\"Impartiality in the Judiciary\\"; Lee, Stephen J. Macrossan was appointed as Chief Justice of Queensland on 17 May 1940. He was unable to make any great changes as he died in office shortly thereafter. He was buried in Nudgee Cemetery.

Description of the book  Despite his widespread influence on the magician community, the author's identity remains an unsolved mystery. Many believe his real name was E.S. Andrews (S.W. Erdnase spelled backwards). (See Gardner's Foreword, pp. vii-ix.) Originally the author started selling the book for $2.00 in 1902 and the next year it dropped to $1.00 and he sold the rights. Although the author did not renew the copyright, the book has remained in print since 1902, albeit small private printings on occasion. The influence of this book is such that it has been issued in annotated form; translated into Japanese, German, Spanish, French, Italian and Russian; and issued as a series of DVDs by a professional magician, demonstrating and explaining Erdnase's techniques and methods. A featured show of the story of Expert of the Card Table is also performed regularly by UK magician Guy Hollingworth. Dai Vernon is credited with popularizing this influential text in the community of professional magicians. Well past ninety years of age, Vernon was fond of quoting from it, with page numbers, when discussing card techniques with his colleagues at the Magic Castle. In Expert Card Technique, Jean Hugard said of it, \\"... perhaps no other book in all the list of conjuring books has been so avidly read, so affectionately regarded.\\" Erdnase's glossary of terms was in itself extremely influential, and has been reproduced more or less directly by numerous authors, including Hugard, and Henry Hay.

The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 1962 Atlantic hurricane season, Daisy developed from a tropical disturbance located well east of the Leeward Islands on September 29\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, it headed west-northwestward and failed to strengthen significantly. While located a short distance from the Leeward Islands, the depression curved northwestward and began intensifying. On October 2, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Daisy. Around that time, the storm turned back to the west-northwest and continued to deepen. Daisy reached hurricane status late on October 3\\\\. Two days later, it became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, but briefly weakened back to a Category 1 on October 6\\\\. Daisy re-strengthened into a Category 2 later on October 6, and peaked with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). The outer bands of Daisy produced strong winds and heavy surf in Bermuda, but caused no damage. It weakened back to a Category 1 again on October 7\\\\. While passing offshore New England, the storm, combined with a nor'easter, produced flooding and strong winds. Two fatalities were directly related to the hurricane, and 24 other people died in traffic related deaths, that were caused by slick roads from the heavy rain. Total damage in New England was estimated to be over $1.1 million (1962 USD). Early on October 8, Daisy made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, several hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. In Atlantic Canada, the storm brought rough seas, causing coastal flooding and six fatalities in Nova Scotia. Meteorological history A Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) revealed the presence of a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September 28. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into a system on the following day indicated that a tropical depression developed near 14.5°N, 48.9°W. The depression initially moved west-northwestward and remained disorganized for several days. In the early stages of the depression, the system appeared to have been located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere, located within a strong east-to-west oriented trough. Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September 30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October 2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated on the following day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane later on October 3. Further deepening occurred, and by October 5, Daisy became a Category 2 hurricane. A nor'easter off the East Coast of the United States caused Daisy to curve northward on October 5\\\\. The storm briefly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane on October 6\\\\. Six hours later, it re-strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane; Daisy also attained its minimum barometric pressure of . Late on October 6, maximum sustained winds reached 110 mph (175 km/h), the highest in relation to the system. Daisy absorbed the nor'easter on October 6, after it weakened. Thereafter, Daisy began accelerating and cold sea surface temperatures weakened the storm back to a Category 1 hurricane on October 7.. It briefly curved north- northwestward, before sharply turning east-northeastward in the Gulf of Maine. Early on October 8, Daisy made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Several hours later, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Daisy re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and headed east-northeastward before dissipating south of Newfoundland on October 9\\\\. Preparations Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, hurricane watches and gale warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands. As Daisy intensified, moved northward, and threatened New England, gale warnings were issued for the coastal areas from Block Island, Rhode Island, to Eastport, Maine, while hurricane watches were issued for the east coast of Maine. Impact=United States= Rainfall from Daisy across the United States Damage totals from Daisy in the United States alone could surpass $10 million, including the passage of a nor'easter a day prior. Two fatalities were directly related to the storm, while 24 other people died from traffic related deaths due to flooded and slick roads. Rainfall from the two systems caused record rainfall in some areas of Massachusetts, with in Wakefield. Some areas of Boston were under of water. The subways associated with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority were flooded and could not be reopened until at least a day after the rain ceased. A total of 7.71 inches (196 mm) of precipitation fell in Portland, Maine within 24 hours, 3.13 inches (80 mm) of which fell in only 6 hours. Subsequently, Hurricane Daisy set a then-record the highest 24‑hour rainfall total for Portland; however, this recorded was broken during Hurricane Bob in 1991. The overall rainfall total for Portland was at the international jetport. In Auburn and Lewiston, a total of of rain fell. The Androscoggin River overflowed and flooded a road in the former. Two fatalities were reported in Maine. Throughout New England, thousands fled after homes, buildings, and school began to flood. It was considered the worst flood in the region since Hurricane Diane in 1955, and was caused partially because falling leaves clogged drains. Damages to boats were severe; hundreds of small boats were destroyed, while many larger boats were damaged. In addition, the lobster industry suffered heavy losses from the system. In the heavy surf that caused those damages to boats, three people were rescued in two different accidents, but they sustained injuries. Also, several small structures in Mount Desert Island, Maine were swept away by the high waves. In other areas of the New England coast, tides were above average; a person was swept away and drowned, and minor tidal flooding occurred in coastal areas. In addition, a pier was washed away in the high surf. Total damage from wave and tide was $600,000. Some roads were completely under water, with pumping operations continuing for four days in the hardest hit locations. Throughout Massachusetts, many roofs were blown off of houses. Strong winds were also reported in New England. The highest winds associated with Daisy were felt over coastal Maine, where winds of 70 mph (115 km/h) were commonly reported. Wind damage was severe and widespread; one person in Maine was killed when a fallen tree landed on, and crushed his car while he was in it. In the southeastern portion of the state, power outages were reported, due to fallen trees and tree limbs. In addition, some roof shingles blown off in Maine and Massachusetts, while other houses were completely unroofed. Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England. Total wind damage in New England was estimated to have reached $500,000. = Elsewhere = During Daisy's track northward, it passed within 200 miles (320 km/h) of Bermuda, causing heavy surf, and up to 65 mph (105 km/h) winds. Wind gusts up to disrupted telephone service in Nova Scotia. Waves of almost above normal in Shelburne smashed three fishing boats, causing 16,000 CAD ($14,866, 1962 USD) in damage. The government pier and building at Sandy Point were lost. Six people were swept into the ocean at Peggy's Cove and drowned. In Lockeport, waves washed sand across a highway. Rough seas in Newfoundland caused fishing boats to be crashed ashore in Seaforth. Strong winds were also reported in Prince Edward Island.

Background  British couple Adam Lloyd (age 25) and Vanessa Arscott (age 24) had been backpacking for two months in Thailand. They were near the end of their holiday and were planning to return home in a few days time. They traveled to the tourist town of Kanchanaburi and were staying at the Sugar Cane guesthouse.  The murder  On 9 September 2004, Lloyd and Arscott were eating a meal at the S & S Restaurant in Kanchanaburi, owned by Mr. Wisetsingh, an off duty policeman when a heated argument ensued. Lloyd and Arscott left the restaurant but were followed by Wisetsingh who shot Mr. Lloyd then chased Ms. Ascot in his car for before running her down and shooting her. Lloyd was shot three times and Arscott twice and both were declared dead at the hospital. Wisetsingh disappeared immediately after the incident, fleeing from a police manhunt over the border to Burma. He was returned to Thailand on 7 October 2004 by officers of the Karen National Liberation Army. He confessed but later said at trial that he was forced into confessing by police.  Trial  During the trial, Wisetsingh changed his plea to not guilty, and denied the murders, blaming them on a mysterious Mr. Ya, a drug informant who he claimed shot the couple while trying to protect his handler. Wisetsingh indicated he was coerced into previous confessions. He was convicted of both murders and was sentenced to serve two life sentences of 50 years, only escaping the death sentence because of his record as a decorated police officer (he had been Outstanding Policeman of the Year for his district on several occasions) and his initial confession to police. The judge then changed his ruling to one life sentence and one sentence of 33 years and four months.  Future  Lloyds parents have expressed concern that Wisetsingh may not serve his full sentence. They have been advised that prisoners may have their sentences reduced for a variety of reasons, including: * Good behaviour * Birthdays of the king and queen * When the King dies (the elderly King Bhumipo) life sentences are halved * When a prince is crowned king life sentences are halved * When an heir is born life sentences are halved The Bangkok Post reported in 2015 that Wisetsingh has been, \\"transferred from top security in Bangkok to his hometown prison in Kanchanaburi.\\"  References  Category:Murder in Thailand Category:2004 crimes in Thailand Category:2004 murders in Asia Category:2000s murders in Thailand ","title":"Murders of Adam Lloyd and Vanessa Arscott"},{"id":"15109772","text":"The Essentials was a Canadian a cappella group founded in London, Ontario, Canada in 1993, that were based out of Toronto from 2000 onward. Band co- founders Joon Nah and Joe Oliva attended London Central Secondary School where they co-founded a predecessor a cappella group to The Essentials, called The Humdingers. Biography The Essentials' first gig was singing a cappella doo-wop songs, weekly during the summer months, in the parking lot of an ice cream parlor called Merla-Mae Ice Cream in London, Ontario. In 1996, Dan Speck joined the band. Speck had been introduced to the band through The Essentials' then-manager Terry McManus via Emm Gryner. Dan Speck's younger brother Thom, formerly of Streetnix, then joined the band in 2005. Both Speck brothers and Gryner have known each other since their youth in the small town of Forest, Ontario. Janet Turner completed the quartet in 2009. Since their inception, The Essentials have focused mostly on performances in Canada and the United States, but have also ventured into Europe. They have performed thousands of shows including the national anthems for the Toronto Blue Jays, Toronto Raptors and Toronto Maple Leafs which has garnered them more national television exposure in Canada. They also appeared in nationally televised ads for Bell ExpressVu in Canada. In 1999, The Essentials played a singing and speaking role in a CBS movie entitled A Holiday Romance along with Paula MacNeill (who would later become a part of the house band on the U.S. nationally televised game show The Singing Bee). The movie stars Andy Griffith, Naomi Judd and Gerald McRaney. Their first two albums, Oh What A Night! and ...And Then Some were produced by highly regarded record producer Jack Richardson, and their 2007 Christmas recording was certified gold in December of that year. The Essentials' latest release, Nothing But Blue, was produced by Darryl Neudorf, charted nationally in Canada, and tied Eminem for No. 1 on the Toronto charts for the week ending 9 September 2010. Since its release in June 2010, Nothing But Blue received positive reviews in regional newspapers as well as by Canada's highest-circulation newspaper The Toronto Star which gave the album 3.5 stars out of 4. Once in 2008, and again in 2010, The Essentials have made special event \\"one-time only\\" return performances to the parking lot of the Merla-Mae Ice Cream parlour where they had not performed since 1996. In 2010, the ice cream parlor added individual sundaes to their menu in honor of the current band line-up as well as former member Nah.

It had its beginnings with the establishment of the Melbourne District Nursing Society in 1885, which later became known as the Royal District Nursing Service (RDNS). RDNS merged with RSL Care in 2015, and in 2017 the organisation adopted its current name to honour two pioneers of Australian healthcare, William Kinsey Bolton and Janet Clarke. History The Melbourne District Nursing Society began in 1885 with a single nurse visiting the homes of the sick and poor to provide compassionate nursing care. With no other nursing service of its kind, support for the newfound form of healthcare grew. As a result, by 1892, more staff were employed to cope with demands and the organisation implemented its own midwifery service. In 1898, a meeting was held in the local town hall and it was decided to start a Collingwood branch of the Melbourne District Nursing Society. First District Nurses in Melbourne By 1906, the organisation had extended its healthcare service to the outer suburbs of Melbourne and employed the use of bicycles to efficiently travel around the city. This form of transportation enabled district nurses to reach more clients, more quickly over a wider geographical area. The Great War saw the onset of 1919 influenza epidemic and placed increasing pressure on the organisation to service more and more clientele. To expedite the number of clients treated, the organisation invested in its first motor car, which would later become an integral identifier of the modern-day home care services. Following the opening of an aftercare hospital in 1926, the organisation extended its care to mothers and infants by opening Melbourne's first \\"Well baby clinic\\", which later became a motivating factor in the development of Victoria's first family planning clinic. Like the Great War, World War II increased the demand for services and the organisation's type of clientele soon became anyone who had a genuine nursing need regardless of age, condition or circumstance. With the expanded need for services, the organisation decentralised its business by opening its first suburban centre in Camberwell.RDNS Annual Report 2005, p. 8. In the 1980s, RDNS began to provide post-acute care treatments for HIV/AIDS, cystic fibrosis and other chronic treatments, care which had previously been confined to hospitals but could now be administered in the home. The HIV Program became integrated with the Victorian AIDS Council's (VAC) HIV Services in the early 1990s, and this relationship has endured for 25 years. Volunteers and paid workers through VAC provide practical assistance and social support and the RDNS nurses provide care coordination and professional nursing care for people living with HIV in the community. The RDNS HIV Program joined with the RDNS Homeless Person's Program in 2015. RSL Care grew from Queensland War Veterans Homes, which opened its first home for veterans in Brisbane, Queensland in 1938. It brought with it a strong asset base in Queensland and New South Wales and significant experience in the operation of residential communities. Experienced health and aged care CEO Stephen Muggleton had begun developing a proposal to merge RSL Care and RDNS in 2012, during a four-year term as CEO of RDNS. When he took on the leadership role at RSL Care in 2015 he put the merger proposal to both boards. In 2015, the two boards independently concluded there were significant benefits in coming together to deliver more health and wellbeing solutions across a broader area. The decision came during a period of major legislative changes in Australia's aged care sector in line with Australia's Aged Care Roadmap and the shift to consumer-directed care. The merged organisation came together under the new brand name, Bolton Clarke, in August 2017. The RSL Care, RDNS, RDNS HomeCare and Rally HomeCare (South Australia) entities were brought under the Bolton Clarke brand, in a move designed to unite the broader service offerings of the combined group of companies under one brand name and resolve the geographical limitations that had restricted use of the original brand names outside their home states. The name pays tribute to two key pioneers whose values helped shape the organisation: • Lady Janet Clarke (1851-1909), a well-known philanthropist, became president of the Melbourne District Nursing Society (later RDNS) in 1889 and remained a driving force in the organisation for more than 20 years. • Lieutenant Colonel William Kinsey Bolton (1860-1941) was a returned serviceman and Gallipoli veteran who in 1916 became the first President of the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' League (forerunner of the Returned and Services League of Australia), Australia's major organisation supporting current and former members of the Defence Forces. Service today Since joining together, Bolton Clarke has expanded its service offering and its footprint. The organisation provides a 24-hour home nursing and home care service to people throughout Australia and New Zealand. It manages 4,400 residential aged care beds and independent living units. The Bolton Clarke Research Institute has a reputation for high impact community health and aged care research. The group works with 19 national and international corporate and research partnerships with a focus on improving knowledge around health and ageing. Its diversified service offerings include provision of the early intervention mental health service NewAccess, developed by beyondblue, which it delivers in South Australia and areas of New South Wales. Bolton Clarke also owns the Aged Care Channel, which operates independently and delivers training for industry members in Australia, the UK, South Africa and New Zealand.

City nicknames can help in establishing a civic identity, helping outsiders recognize a community or attracting people to a community because of its nickname; promote civic pride; and build community unity. Nicknames and slogans that successfully create a new community \\"ideology or myth\\" are also believed to have economic value. Their economic value is difficult to measure, but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by \\"branding\\" themselves by adopting new slogans.Alfredo Andia, Branding the Generic City :) , MU.DOT magazine, September 10, 2007 Some unofficial nicknames are positive, while others are derisive.

Trans-Canada Highway passes a short distance to the south. It was formed in 1929 with the completion of the Ghost Dam, and was developed on land leased from the Nakoda first nations by Calgary Power Ltd. The lake and dam are primarily used for power generation. The Ghost plant generates an average of 173,000 megawatt hours each year. Calgary Power changed its name to TransAlta Utilities in 1981. The lake freezes in December until approximately mid-May. Sport fish include lake trout, mountain whitefish, lake whitefish and brown trout. Large fluctuations in water level due to power generation affect the recreational opportunities and biological productivity of the lake. The volume of water being released from the lake and the variance thereof also affect the Bow River downstream of the dam. The location brings consistent, strong winds, which make the lake suitable for sailing and iceboating. The Ghost Lake Iceboat Club is located at Ghost Lake. Ghost Lake was also selected as the swimming venue for the inaugural Ironman Calgary 70.3. The summer village of Ghost Lake is located on the northern shore of the lake, about upstream from the dam. Only the Ghost Reservoir Provincial Recreation Area between the mouth of the Ghost River and the northeastern end of the lake, right next to the dam, provides public access to the lake.

The film's costumes feature enormous versions of the familiar hats of Robin and his merry men, and uses the unusual effect of momentarily superimposing images of different animals over each character to emphasize their good or evil qualities. The film was directed by Étienne Arnaud and Herbert Blaché, and written by Eustace Hale Ball.

Believed to have been established in 1009 AD by King Stephen I of Hungary, as the Diocese of Veszprém, the diocese was originally a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Esztergom. In 1992, the Diocese was elevated to an Archdiocese. The Archdiocese is the Metropolitan of the Diocese of Kaposvár and the Diocese of Szombathely. The Cathedral of Veszprém is dedicated to Saint Michael. The current archbishop-designate is György Udvardy, formerly Bishop of Pecs, who was appointed by Pope Francis on July 12, 2019, to succeed the retiring Gyula Márfi. Establishment of the Diocese The circumstances of the establishment of the episcopal see in Veszprém are still under debate. It is probable that Veszprém was the habitual residence of Bishop Bruno, who had been sent to evangelise the Magyars in 972; but it was probably only in 1009 when King Stephen I of Hungary issued the Deed of Foundation of the Diocese of Veszprém.However, it is not clear whether it was really a Deed of Foundation or it only served to determine the frontiers of the diocese and the estates of the bishopric. Based on the Deed of Foundation, the territory of the Diocese of Veszprém extended over the territories of the Counties of Veszprém, Fejér, Visegrád and Kolon.\\"Therefore, let the Holy Church of God and all our present and future adherents know that we place four castles (by name Veszprém, where the episcopal see is found, Fehérvár, Kolon and Visegrád) under Saint Michael's Church in Veszprém, together with all their churches, chapels, altars, frontiers and lands\\". The Diocese of Veszprém was suffragan to the Archdiocese of Esztergom. When the Abbey of Pannonhalma was established in 1001, King Stephen I granted the tithes of the County of Somogy to the Abbey, but the county itself still belonged to the Diocese of Veszprém. The diocese was linked traditionally to the queen consort. Thus, the ius patronatus of the Cathedral in Veszprém was due to not only the king of Hungary but also his wife. 11th–14th centuries Based on the tradition, the bishop of Veszprém was entitled to crown queens of Hungary, and this tradition was confirmed by an agreement between Bishop Robert of Veszprém and Archbishop János of Esztergom in April 1216. The bishop of Veszprém became also the queen's chancellor . The first bishop of Veszprém who used the title was Bertalan, Bishop of Veszprém, and in 1269 King Béla IV confirmed that the title was connected to the bishopric. In the year 1294, Queen Fenenna confirmed that, at that time, Dowager Queen Elizabeth had the privilege to collect the donations of the church in the Veszprém County, despite being a former queen. On 26 October 1313, King Charles I and Bishop Stephen Kéki concluded an agreement under which the Bishop ceded the tithe of Csepel Island to the King in exchange for the County of Veszprém. The agreement was confirmed, in 1392, by King Sigismund; therefore the bishops of Veszprém became also the perpetual ispáns of Veszprém.

NekoVM's native language is the bytecode for a high-level dynamically typed programming language called Neko. This pairing allows Neko to be used directly as an embedded scripting language or to target NekoVM by compiling some other language (such as Haxe) to NekoVM bytecode. Concept Neko has a compiler and a virtual machine (VM) with garbage collection. The compiler converts a source .neko file into a bytecode .n file that can be executed with the VM. Since Neko is dynamically typed with no fixed classes, a developer only needs to find the proper runtime mapping (in contrast to type mapping) so that code executes correctly. As the Neko FAQ puts it: \\"...it is easier to write a new or existing language on the NekoVM than it is for the CLR / JVM, since you don’t have to deal with a highlevel type system. Also, this means that languages can interoperate more easily since they only need to share the same data structures and not always the same types.\\" Neko requires compiling before executing, like other scripting languages such as Apache Groovy. Since Neko need not be interpreted at runtime, it executes faster. The Haxe programming language can compile to Neko code, among other targets. Virtual machine The Neko virtual machine is used to execute a Neko bytecode file, the VM also has the option to convert a bytecode file into an executable file (output changes depending on the target operating system).

It is the sole species in the monotypic genus Shiraia. It is widely distributed in many provinces of Southern China and also in Japan. The genus Shiraia, named after Dr. Mitsutaro Shirai, was first established and proposed as a member of the family Nectriaceae by P. Hennings in 1900. Although the familial placement is somewhat uncertain, molecular phylogenetic evidence based on the sequences of ribosomal DNA supports its positioning in the Phaeosphaeriaceae. The extracts from its stromata contain hypocrellins and shiraiachromes, members of perylenequinone class of natural products, which are photoactivated therapeutic agents. Hypocrellins were firstly found in another filamentous fungus Hypocrella bambuase, which is also parasitic on bamboos.

Membership is a condition of admission to practice law in Georgia. The State Bar was established in 1964 as the successor of the prior voluntary Georgia Bar Association which was founded in 1884. The stated purpose of the State Bar of Georgia is to foster among the members of the Bar of this state the principles of duty and service to the public; to improve the administration of justice; and to advance the science of law. The Bar has strict codes of ethics and discipline that are enforced by the Supreme Court of Georgia through the State Bar's Office of the General Counsel. Membership dues and other contributions help the Bar provide programs that are mutually beneficial to its members and the general public. Membership By order of the Supreme Court of Georgia (219 GA 873 and subsequent amendments), one is required before engaging in the practice of law to register with the State Bar and to pay the prescribed dues. Following are statistics regarding State Bar of Georgia members as of March 2, 2015: * Active members in good standing: 37,031 * Inactive members in good standing: 8,562 * Emeritus members: 1,645 * Affiliate members: 20 * Student members: 148 * Foreign law consultants: 7 * Overall Membership: 47,143 Programs The Bar offers a variety of programs: * BASICS * Committee to Promote Inclusion in the Profession * Consumer Assistance Program * Continuing Legal Education * Cornerstones of Freedom Program * Fee Arbitration * Georgia Diversity Program * Judicial District Professionalism Program * Law-Related Education * Law Practice Management Program * Lawyer Assistance Program * Legislative Program * Military Legal Assistance Program * Pro Bono Resource Center * SOLACE Program * Transition Into Law Practice Program * Unlicensed Practice of Law * Young Lawyers Division Ethics Georgia lawyers are bound by strict rules of ethics in all of their professional dealings. The Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct help define a lawyer's obligations to clients, to the judicial system, and to the public. Although the Supreme Court of Georgia retains ultimate authority to regulate the legal profession, the State Bar of Georgia's Office of the General Counsel serves as the Court's arm to investigate and prosecute claims that a lawyer has violated the ethics rules. The Rules of Professional Conduct are found at Part IV, Chapter 1 of the Bar Rules. Part IV, Chapter 2 contains the procedural rules for disciplinary actions against lawyers. In addition to the Rules, the Bar and the Supreme Court periodically have issued Formal Advisory Opinions that clarify a lawyer's obligations in certain situations. A complete list of Formal Advisory Opinions follows Part IV, Chapter 3 of the Bar Rules. Lawyers who would like to discuss an ethics dilemma with a member of the Office of the General Counsel staff should contact the Lawyer Helpline at 404-527-8720 or 800-334-6865. Members of the public who believe that a Georgia lawyer has violated the rules of ethics should contact the Bar's Consumer Assistance Program at 800-334-6865.

The Board of Governors is the 160-member policymaking authority of the State Bar, with representation from each of Georgia's judicial circuits. The board holds regular meetings five times per year. It elects six of its members to serving on the Executive Committee with the organization's officers. The Executive Committee meets monthly and exercises the power of the Board of Governors when the board is not in session. Offices The State Bar of Georgia has three offices: in Atlanta, Savannah and Tifton. The headquarters of State Bar of Georgia, known as the Bar Center, is located at 104 Marietta Street NW, Atlanta, GA 30303. Phone 404-527-8700. The South Georgia Office is located at 244 E. Second Street, Tifton, GA 31793. Phone 229-387-0446. The Coastal Georgia Office is located at 18 E. Bay Street, Savannah, GA 31401.

Young Lawyers Division All newly admitted members of the State Bar automatically become members of the Young Lawyers Division (YLD). Membership in the YLD terminates at the end of the fiscal year after (1) the lawyer's 36th birthday or (2) the fifth anniversary of the lawyer's first admission to practice, whichever is later. It has been strengthened over the years through guidance by the State Bar of Georgia, its Executive Committee and Board of Directors, the Supreme Court, and through dedicated service rendered by its members. In keeping with its motto of \\"working for the profession and the public,\\" the YLD has 27 hard-working committees that provide service to the public, the profession, and the Bar through an array of projects and programs. Through the years, the YLD has also gained national recognition by winning several American Bar Association awards for its projects and publications. History In 1878, the American Bar Association was founded at Saratoga Springs, NY. It soon began to encourage its members to form organizations of the legal profession in their respective states. Five years later, in 1883, coincidental events occurred that would be entwined in history. In June, a frail, lonely and dyslexic Woodrow Wilson gave up on his failing law practice on Spring Street in Atlanta, which he described as \\"dreadful drudgery.\\" Few noticed or cared when he boarded a northbound train bound for graduate school at Johns Hopkins. There was scarcely a less likely prospect to become, 30 years later, President of the United States. In September, the General Assembly, meeting at a building that combined the Atlanta city hall and Fulton County courthouse, appropriated one million dollars to build a new state capitol building on the same site. And in Macon, five Georgia members of the American Bar Association had a conversation about forming a Georgia Bar Association. The next year, 1884, there was a meeting in Atlanta to form the Georgia Bar Association. The initial members of the Georgia Bar Association were all the Georgia members of the ABA. They chose as the first state bar president L. N. Whittle, who was commander of the Macon Militia during the Civil War. Anyone experienced in the ways of voluntary organizations may appreciate the fact that Col. Whittle was detained at a college trustees meeting in Tennessee, so he was unable to attend the meeting at which he was elected president. His service as the first president of the Georgia Bar was a point too insignificant to be mentioned in his obituary two years later. =Macon headquarters= In the late 19th century, Macon was not only in the middle of the state geographically speaking; it was essentially the population center of Georgia and was easily accessible to the rest of the state. All roads and rail lines seemingly led to Macon. While neighboring Milledgeville had lost its status as state capital to Atlanta in the aftermath of a Civil War ransacking, Macon had been bypassed on Sherman's march to the sea, and the city by the Ocmulgee River prospered through the Reconstruction era. When the state's legal community formed the Georgia Bar Association in 1883, Macon was chosen as its headquarters location, and it remained so for the next 90 years. L.N. Whittle was the first of 10 Macon lawyers to serve as president of the Georgia Bar Association during its eight decades of existence. He and Walter B. Hill, also of Macon, who served as the first secretary/treasurer, were among 11 petitioners from around the state listed on the association's corporate charter when it was granted by the Superior Court of Bibb County on July 19, 1884. Although membership remained strictly voluntary, the Georgia Bar Association gradually expanded its activities and organizational efforts throughout the state. In 1942, the association set up an office in downtown Macon, utilizing space in the Persons Building offered by the law firm of John B. Harris, who was then the secretary of the Georgia Bar and later served as its president. Beginning a practice in the same building in 1950, one floor above the Harris Firm, was a new lawyer named Frank C. Jones, who would later become president of the State Bar of Georgia. \\"During those years, I had frequent contact with Mr. Harris and his firm's personnel, including Madrid Williams, a remarkably able and talented individual,\\" Jones said in a recent interview. \\"I was president of the Younger Lawyers Section in 1956-57 and worked closely with Mrs. Williams in that respect. John D. Comer, who was then practicing with the Harris Firm, and I served for several years as associate editors of the Georgia Bar Journal. We would review proposed articles and meet on a regular basis with Mr. Harris and Madrid to discuss the acceptability of these articles and other matters.\\" =Unified Bar= Efforts to bring about a unified bar in Georgia began in the late 1920s and continued almost without interruption. In 1963, soon after his inauguration, Governor Carl Sanders was visited by Atlanta lawyers Gus Cleveland and Harry Baxter, who had been delegated by the voluntary Georgia Bar Association to approach the Governor about supporting legislation to create a unified State Bar. It turned out to be an easier task than they expected, as the 37-year-old new lawyer-Governor immediately saw the advantages of an organized Bar capable of enforcing academic and professional standards for would-be lawyers along with a disciplinary process to protect the public from lawyer misconduct. Sanders later recalled that, \\"Up until that time, while a fairly rigorous written Bar exam was required of every applicant, it was not nearly as comprehensive and onerous as the one we have today, and there was no multistate component. Also, the Bar association at the time was a toothless tiger, unorganized, with no right to discipline its members.\\" The governor told Baxter and Cleveland (who later served as State Bar president in 1971-72) that his administration would indeed support the unified Bar proposal. He directed his House of Representatives floor leader, future Attorney General Arthur Bolton, and the lieutenant governor, future Supreme Court Justice George T. Smith, to head up the legislative effort. The harder task was actually passing the bill. \\"Any time you seek to change something that has been in existence for that many years, it's going to be difficult,\\" Sanders said. \\"Like many other lawyers, I knew there were going to be some who would not be able to meet the requirements.\\" He recalls there was vigorous opposition to the proposal under the Gold Dome. \\"I remember Johnnie Caldwell (who later served as the state's insurance commissioner) making a long speech in the House about Abraham Lincoln having read the law by candlelight in a log cabin in Illinois,\\" Sanders said. \\"He said if that was good enough for Abe Lincoln, it was good enough for Georgia.\\" In 1963 the General Assembly passed an Act (Ga. L. 1963, p. 70) stating that \\". . . the Supreme Court of this State shall be authorized, upon a petition presented by the Georgia Bar Association, to establish, as an administrative arm of the court, a unified self-governing bar association to be known as the 'State Bar of Georgia' composed of all persons now or hereafter licensed to practice law in this State.\\" This Act recited that it gave the Supreme Court authority, upon recommendation of the Georgia Bar Association, to adopt rules and regulations for the organization of a unified bar and to define the rights, duties and obligations of members, including payment of a reasonable license fee, and to otherwise regulate and govern the practice of law in Georgia. A committee of 22 lawyers was charged with taking the next steps, which included the preparation and filing of a petition with the Supreme Court of Georgia, asking for the Court's approval. Although some opposition was voiced at a hearing in October, the Court issued an order on Dec. 6, 1963, establishing the State Bar of Georgia.Pursuant to this grant of authority, the Supreme Court of Georgia created and established the State Bar of Georgia by court order on December 6, 1963.Minutes of the Supreme Court at Volume 34, page 107 Thus, the State Bar of Georgia was created pursuant to the authority of the Supreme Court of Georgia and the Act of the Georgia General Assembly approved by the Governor on March 11, 1963 (Georgia Laws 1963, page 70). The initial draft of the proposed rules for the new State Bar was discussed and agreed upon in an all-day meeting in the conference room of Frank Jones' law firm in Macon, under the leadership of Newell Edenfield of Atlanta, who chaired the organizational committee, and Holcombe Perry of Albany, who was president of the Georgia Bar Association in 1962-63. Attributing the successful incorporation of the Bar in large part to Perry's leadership as president, Jones said, \\"Holcombe worked hundreds of hours on this undertaking, and few, if any, other lawyers in Georgia could have achieved the success that he did.\\" In 1968, Jones was elected as the unified Bar's sixth president and the first of three from Macon. He says a highlight of his term was the Supreme Court of Georgia issuing resounding opinions in Wallace v. Wallace and Sams v. Olah, rejecting constitutional challenges to the State Bar of Georgia's existence. Creation of the unified Bar was not without controversy. The only member of the Board of Governors ever \\"impeached\\" by the lawyers in his circuit was due to his support of bar unification. Irwin Stolz was informally impeached—as there was no procedure for that—at a meeting of the Lookout Mountain Circuit Bar Association in 1963. He later served as State Bar president and on the Georgia Court of Appeals, and his law partner, Norman Fletcher, became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In their post-judicial careers, Stolz practices law in Athens and practices law and mediates in Rome. =Move of headquarters to Atlanta= During Frank Jones' presidency of the State Bar, the potential benefits of moving the Bar headquarters from Macon to Atlanta started to become obvious to him. In addition to quarterly meetings of the Board of Governors that were held around the state and the annual meeting that was almost always in Savannah, there were meetings of the Executive Committee and various general and special committees and other meetings that Jones sought to attend. \\"The great majority of these meetings were held in Atlanta, with virtually none in Macon, because Atlanta was more convenient to a majority of attendees and the facilities were limited in Macon,\\" Jones said. \\"Madrid Williams or Judge Mallory C. Atkinson, our first general counsel, and sometimes both, usually accompanied me in traveling to Atlanta for such meetings and we would talk from time to time about the probable need someday to move the office to Atlanta.\\" Jones also noted that Atlanta was shedding its reputation as what he called \\"kind of a sleepy metropolis.\\" Starting in the 1960s, there was an explosive growth in the number of lawyers practicing in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and many law firms greatly increased in size. In 1971-72, Jones served on the Governor's Commission on Judicial Processes, chaired by Hon. Bob Hall. The panel's recommendations resulted in the establishment of the Judicial Qualifications Commission (JQC) as a constitutional body and the Judicial Nominating Commission (JNC) by executive order of each of Georgia's governors. \\"The meetings of the JQC were invariably held in the Judicial Building because we reported our findings and recommendations to the Supreme Court of Georgia, and the meetings of the JNC were normally held in Atlanta as well,\\" Jones said. \\"This is another illustration of how Atlanta increasingly became the focus of the activities of the State Bar and related organizations.\\" A Special Committee on State Bar Headquarters was appointed in 1970, with Jones as chairman and Ben L. Weinberg Jr. as vice chairman. Also serving were B. Carl Buice, Wilton D. Harrington, G. Conley Ingram, H.H. Perry Jr., Hon. Paul W. Painter and Frank W. \\"Sonny\\" Seiler, with then- Bar President Irwin W. Stolz Jr., A.G. Cleveland Jr. and Thomas E. Dennard Jr. as ex-officio members. In November 1971, the committee submitted its final report during a meeting of the Board of Governors, officially recommending that the State Bar headquarters be moved from Macon to downtown Atlanta because, in part, \\"Ideally, the headquarters should be reasonably close to the State Capitol area, as accessible as possible to those lawyers throughout the state who would enter Atlanta on the interstate and other highways, and at the same time not inconvenient to the large number of State Bar of Georgia members who have their offices in the business and financial district in Atlanta.\\" The fact that the State Bar had been authorized by the Supreme Court of Georgia, and its rules had to be approved by the Supreme Court, was another persuasive reason why the headquarters should be in downtown Atlanta and within reasonable proximity to the Supreme Court. The report acknowledged that the anticipated doubling of office space, addition of at least one more staff member, higher rental rates and salary scales prevailing in Atlanta and various other factors would result in a substantial increase in operating expenses. A dues increase would undoubtedly be required. One of the committee's recommendations specified: \\"The State Bar of Georgia should not give any further consideration at this time to building its own headquarters building (as some other state bars have done).\\" Jones said, \\"That was a wise decision at the time, I believe. We needed to walk before we could run.\\" After the committee's recommendations were unanimously approved by the Board of Governors, the wheels were set in motion for the move from Macon to Atlanta. F. Jack Adams joined committee members Seiler and Cleveland in submitting a detailed report concerning costs and a proposed dues increase, which was approved by the board in July 1972. Increased expenditures were estimated at just over $75,000, necessitating a dues increase of $20 per year. The target date for opening the new headquarters in the Fulton National Bank building was July 1, 1973. By Feb. 9, the contract had already been signed, construction of the offices was underway and moving vans were packed and ready to leave Macon for Atlanta. Seiler, who was the State Bar president that year, recounted, in his end-of-year report for the 1973 annual meeting, what happened next. \\"I'll never forget that day,\\" Seiler said of the planned moving day of Feb. 9. \\"Gus Cleveland, Jack Adams and I were in Cleveland, Ohio, attending the ABA National Conference of Bar Presidents. It was extremely cold in Cleveland, but the skies were clear. We knew that winter storms were harassing the South, and Gus and I had speculated as to whether or not the move could be accomplished. On the day of the intended move, I picked up a Cleveland paper and the headlines read 'Heavy Snow Hits Macon, Georgia,' and I knew darn well they weren't talking about Cubbege Jr. or Sr.!\\" (Cubbege Snow was the name of a father-son legal duo in Macon, with a third generation having since joined the practice.) The snow melted a few days later, and the new office was fully occupied on Law Day, May 1, 1973, two months ahead of schedule. Performing an integral role in the move was Madrid Williams, who had originally informed the officers of her intention to retire as executive secretary on Jan. 1, 1973, rather than make the move to Atlanta. \\"But she got caught up in the excitement,\\" Jones said, and instead of retiring, Williams wound up personally supervising the entire project, coordinating the moving and purchase of equipment, furniture and decorations, as well as interviewing and hiring new staff members. \\"Her help was invaluable during those first years after the move,\\" Jones said of Williams, who in 1970 became one of the first women to serve as president of the National Association of Bar Executives. She did retire in 1976, a full 34 years after opening the first Georgia Bar Association office. f According to Jones, opposition to the move from Macon to Atlanta was virtually non-existent, and the only backlash he received from below Georgia's fall line for having spearheaded the effort was some good-natured ribbing from his hometown colleagues. \\"When I accepted an invitation to become a partner in the firm of King & Spalding LLP in Atlanta as of July 1, 1977, several of my friends jokingly remarked that I was being run out of Macon because I had been instrumental in the move,\\" Jones said. \\"But I had realized it would be an easier pill to swallow if a past president from Macon was the one making the recommendation.\\" Jones concluded, \\"In my judgment both then and now, it was essential that the State Bar have its headquarters conveniently located in downtown Atlanta in order to maximize its service to the lawyers of Georgia, the judiciary and the general public. Such a location provides ready access to the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Governor's Office, the General Assembly and other governmental agencies with which the State Bar has dealings from time to time. It is also consistent with the extraordinary growth in the number of practicing lawyers residing in the greater Atlanta area.\\" =Georgia Bar Center= In 1995, the State Bar began an effort to establish a Bar Center that would be a professional gathering place for members of the profession from around the state. After an exhaustive search and a struggle with financing, the State Bar purchased the former home of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The Georgia Bar Center is reputedly the finest state bar headquarters in the United States, in the assessment of delegates to the ABA midyear meeting in 2011. It includes a conference center used for continuing legal education seminars and professional meetings almost daily, a law related education program that hosts over 10,000 school children each year, the offices of the State Bar and a number of other law related organizations. In addition, visiting bar members enjoy free parking when attending events in downtown Atlanta. And adjoining the lobby is a small museum depicting a nineteenth-century law office near the site of the Bar Center, where Woodrow Wilson labored until he gave up the \\"dreadful drudgery\\" of law practice and boarded a northbound train in 1883. =Past Presidents= Past presidents of the former Georgia Bar Association and the State Bar of Georgia include the following.

The du Bousquet locomotive was an unusual design of articulated steam locomotive invented by French locomotive designer Gaston du Bousquet. The design was a tank locomotive, carrying all its fuel and water on board the locomotive proper, and a compound locomotive. The boiler and superstructure were supported upon two swivelling trucks, in a manner similar to a Meyer locomotive. Design Line drawing of the locomotive design. The design largely overcame the problems the Meyer design had with poor sealing on the steam-pipe flexible joints by having the rear truck, bearing the high-pressure cylinders, mounted on a bearing that permitted only rotation and not any other axes of flexibility. The steam connection, mounted in the center of this, could seal much more easily since it did not have to allow so much freedom of movement. The front truck, with the low-pressure cylinders, allowed some degree of tilt as well as rotation, and had steam connections from the rear truck with swivelling and telescoping joints to allow freedom of movement. Also unlike the Meyer, the front set of water tanks were mounted to the moving truck and moved relative to the boiler, somewhat reminiscent of a Garratt locomotive. The tanks above the rear truck, and the rear-mounted fuel bunker, were attached to the boiler and superstructure. The du Bousquet design had an unusual wheel arrangement; both trucks had six driving wheels and two carrying wheels supporting the cylinders. Unlike many other articulated designs, these carrying wheels were toward the center of the locomotive, as were the cylinders. This arrangement is expressed in the French classification as 031+130, in the Whyte notation as 0-6-2+2-6-0T, or in the UIC classification as (C1′)+(1′C) n4tv. French use The du Bousquet design of locomotive saw most success in France, with three railway systems ordering the type; the Chemins de Fer du Nord, the Chemins de fer de l'Est, and the Syndicat des Ceinture (the Outer (Grande Ceinture) and Inner Circle (Petite Ceinture) lines of Paris). =Nord= The Nord was the first to own the type, appropriately since du Bousquet was their Chief of Motive Power. They constructed 48 units, numbered 6.121 to 6.168, which were painted chocolate brown like all the Nord's compounds and assigned to the Le Bourget and Hirson depots. They worked heavy coal trains. In 1921, however, 34 of the 48 locomotives were transferred to the Grande Ceinture, where they worked until 1935, when the closure of many of the Ceinture lines rendered them surplus. All but one passed to the SNCF in 1938 wo renumbered them 2-031+130.TA.1 to 47. They were slowly replaced by the SNCF 151.TQ class, but the last du Bousquet was not withdrawn until 1952. =Est= The Est built 13 du Bousquet locomotives at their Épernay Works between 1910 and 1911. Numbered 6101 to 6113, these were identical to the Nord locomotives, being constructed from the same plans. All of them were transferred to the Syndicat des Ceinture in 1921, and when the Syndicat was dissolved in 1934 they were leased to the Nord. Eventually they became SNCF 2-031+132.TB.1 to 12. =Ceintures= In addition to the Nord and Est locomotives reassigned to the Ceintures, that system also acquired 38 du Bousquet locomotives directly, 32 of them from the Société des Batignolles and six constructed by Société anonyme John Cockerill. These locomotives were somewhat more powerful than those of the Nord and the Est, especially after they were upgraded to superheat in the 1920s. These locomotives were transferred to the Chemin de fer de l'État in 1934, and to the SNCF in 1938. The SNCF renumbered them 3-031+130.TA.1 to 36; all withdrawn by 1949. Outside France The type saw limited success outside France, being confined to China and Spain. =China= A batch were built for the Peking–Hankow Railway in China; they were almost identical to the French locomotives, and were built by the Belgian company . =Spain= Ten locomotives were built for the to the Spanish gauge by SA Usines Métallurgiques du Hainaut. Six survived after the founding of RENFE, but were withdrawn by 1947.

He joined the Communist Party of China in 1928, and rose to the position of director of the Xinhua News Agency; after 1949, he worked in various positions related to foreign affairs, most prominently president of the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, president of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Society, and Minister of the Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs. Early life Liao Chengzhi in 1909, held by his mother He Xiangning Liao Chengzhi, He Xiangning, and Liao Mengxing at Liao Zhongkai's side after his death Liao was born in the Ōkubo neighbourhood of Tokyo in 1908 to father Liao Zhongkai and mother He Xiangning. His father had wanted to study abroad ever since he was a student at Hong Kong's Queen's College; he left his wife behind in Hong Kong to pursue his studies in Tokyo in January 1903, but she joined him there just three months later. She pursued education there as well, taking time off after young Liao was born, but returning to school just six months later. Based on the excerpt reprinted in Liao was overweight as a child; even his own parents referred to him as \\"fatty\\" (). His parents became members of the Kuomintang very early on; Sun Yat-sen was a frequent visitor to their household, sparking the young Liao's interest in politics. He and his sister Liao Mengxing also studied wushu with one of Sun's bodyguards. His family moved frequently; the young Liao attended school in Tokyo, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Liao returned to his parents' home of Guangdong in 1923, where he entered the middle school attached to Lingnan University. He first met Zhou Enlai, who was then an instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou, the following year. Under Zhou's influence, Liao became further interested in politics, and joined the Kuomintang. In June 1925, he was one of the leaders of a protest march in Guangzhou which was fired upon by British and French troops, in what became known as the Shaji Incident; Liao himself had his hat shot off, and barely escaped with his life. His father was assassinated two months later by a member of a rival faction in the Kuomintang. In 1927, fearing for her family's lives, his mother took Liao and his siblings back into exile in Tokyo. The following year, he not only entered Waseda University, but also joined the Tokyo branch of the Chinese Communist Party, which provoked the university to expel him. His political activities also attracted unfavourable attention from the Japanese government, which deported him in the summer of that year; he then proceeded to Shanghai. In November 1928, Liao went to Berlin, Germany, where he both studied and continued his political activities. His mother, who had returned to China from Japan, soon left the country again in disgust with Chiang Kai-shek's government; she first went to Paris where she made a living selling paintings before joining her son in Berlin. His mother would return to Shanghai with Soong Ching-ling in September 1931, just after the Mukden Incident, to join the anti-Japanese resistance movement. Around the same time, Liao was arrested by German police and deported again; he followed his mother to Shanghai in 1932. He then became secretary of the Communist Party Group of the National Seamen's Union. His political activities again brought him trouble, leading to his arrest in March 1933; however, he was released due to the efforts of Soong Ching-ling. Back in Shanghai, Liao struck up a relationship with Jing Puchun (); her father , a painter, was Liao's mother's friend, former classmate in Japan, and neighbour. Jing Puchun had come from Zhejiang to Shanghai with her elder brother to visit him. She was just 16 at the time. Her elder brother objected strenuously to their relationship, due to Liao's CPC membership; he feared his sister would get mixed up in political conflicts. In mid-July, her elder brother took her back to Zhejiang. The two kept in touch by letters; in August 1933, when Liao received CPC orders sending him to the Sichuan–Shaanxi area, he asked Jing in a letter to \\"wait for me for two years, if you truly love me\\". Fighting the Nationalists and Japan In August 1933, Liao bid farewell to his mother and, under the orders of the Party, proceeded to the Sichuan-Shaanxi area carrying Kuomintang codes which would allow the Communists to decrypt their telegraph messages. After his arrival there, he became Secretary of the Politburo of the Chinese Red Army's Fourth Front Army. However, he offended his superior Zhang Guotao by pointing out some of his ideological errors; Zhang Guotao criticised Liao as a \\"member of a Kuomintang family\\" and had him arrested. He spent two more years in a CPC prison, and thus ended the Long March as a criminal, but was restored to good standing in the Party in late 1936 while in northern Shaanxi by Mao Zedong and his old friend Zhou Enlai. He then began his work with the Red China News Agency, Xinhua's forerunner, where he put his international experience to good use, translating news into English, French, German, and Japanese. In December 1937, as the Second Sino-Japanese War intensified, he was sent to Hong Kong, where he ran the Eighth Route Army's office. Among other matters, he was responsible for arms purchases for the CPC's Southern Bureau. His work there formed the foundation of what would become the CPC's united front strategy in the territory, aimed at using Hong Kong's economic resources and connections to overseas Chinese communities to fund CPC aims; indeed, while in Hong Kong, Liao cultivated relations and alliances with the territory's \\"big capitalists\\". His mother arranged for Jing Puchun to be sent there as well, as a surprise for her son; the two had a joyous reunion at the docks as Liao stepped off his ship, and married soon after, on 11 January 1938. Liao left Hong Kong in January 1941, but after the Imperial Japanese Army invaded and occupied the city, he was chosen for his fluency in Japanese along with Lian Guan to sneak back in and establish contact with fellow revolutionaries who had been trapped there; by May, he had helped over 500 people escape from Hong Kong, including his mother, Soong Ching-ling, Mao Dun, Xia Yan, Liang Shuming, Cai Chusheng, Liu Yazi, Hu Feng, Hu Sheng, and Zou Taofen (邹韬奋). However, Liao's work was interrupted on 30 May 1942, when he was arrested in Guangdong's Lechang, Shaoguan area. His captors transported him to southern Jiangxi and held in the Majiazhou Prison Camp in Taihe. His arrest was the result of a long investigation by the KMT, and would prove the undoing of the CPC's organisation in southern China; in the following months, the KMT arrested hundreds of other CPC members. His mother, Dong Biwu, and Zhou Enlai all wrote letters to KMT authorities pleading for Liao's life, in which they stressed the need for unity against the Japanese and the common revolutionary origin of the KMT and the CPC, reflected in Liao's father's relationship with Sun Yat-sen; in the end, Chiang Kai-shek was moved to spare Liao's life. Chiang's son Chiang Ching-kuo was assigned to supervise Liao's captivity. His personal connections notwithstanding, Liao was subject to poor conditions and various tortures during his imprisonment, and developed lung disease as a result. However, such was the respect of his fellow revolutionaries for him that even while in prison, he was elected as an alternate member of the CPC's Politburo by the representatives of the 7th National Congress in Yan'an in April 1945. In January 1946, Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to the prison camp in Ganzhou where the young Liao was being held, directing that he be flown to the KMT's seat of government, then still located in Chongqing. Liao's treatment improved markedly upon his arrival; he was given a new suit of clothes and better food to eat. Chiang tried to pressure Liao into renouncing his affiliation with the CPC, but Liao refused. Soon after, on 22 January, in accordance with the terms of the Double Tenth Agreement between the KMT and the CPC, Liao was released and returned to Yan'an, where his wife was waiting for him. Upon his return, he was named head of the Xinhua News Agency. However, again his reunion with his wife was brief; the CPC soon dispatched Liao to the Taihang Mountains on Xinhua-related work. After 1949 In the 1960s, Liao led Chinese delegations in a number of negotiations with Japanese counterparts, including in discussions which led to the Sino-Japanese Journalist Exchange Agreements. Even as he turned 70, Liao remained active and busy in politics, in 1978 heading up the newly established Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the newly revived Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, of whose predecessor he had been the head up until 1970. He also continued to play an important role in Sino-Japanese relations, accompanying Deng Xiaoping on his visit to Japan, meeting with Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda. In March 1980, with his health worsening, Liao flew to the United States to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery at the Stanford University's Medical Center. He remained overweight even in his twilight years; after his surgery, his wife tried to manage his diet more closely, but he continued to eat fatty foods and smoke the occasional cigarette. In 1982, he received an honorary doctorate from his alma mater of Waseda. On 25 July of the same year, the People's Daily published Liao's open letter to his old jailer Chiang Ching-kuo, who by then had risen to the position of President of the Republic of China. Addressing Chiang as \\"my brother\\", he again touched upon the theme of the common origin of the two parties, and urged Chiang to take proactive steps towards the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan. Liao died of a heart attack at 5:22 AM on 10 June 1983 in Beijing. His death came at an untimely juncture for China, as he was nominated for the position of Vice President of the People's Republic of China only four days earlier. Chinese President Li Xiannian gave memorial speech at his funeral.Ceremony honours Liao Chengzhi  chinadaily.com.cn ReferencesFurther reading  * * Category:1908 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Chinese expatriates in Japan Category:Diplomats of the People's Republic of China Category:Chinese politicians of Hakka descent Category:Chinese people of American descent Category:People from Huiyang Category:Politicians from Tokyo Category:Politicians of the People's Republic of China Category:Beijing Foreign Studies University faculty Category:Members of the Kuomintang Category:Politicians of the Republic of China Category:Moscow Sun Yat-sen University alumni Category:Waseda University alumni Category:Delegates to the 3rd National People's Congress Category:Members of the 12th Politburo of the Communist Party of China Category:Alumni of Queen's College, Hong Kong Category:Vice Chairpersons of the National People's Congress Category:Burials at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery ","title":"Liao Chengzhi"},{"id":"15110558","title":"U.S. Route 89 in Utah"},{"id":"15110565","text":"U.S. Route 191 (US-191) is a major north-south state highway through the eastern part of the U.S. state of Utah. The present alignment of US-191, which stretches from Mexico to Canada, was created in 1981 through Utah. Previously the route had entered northern Utah, ending at US-91 in Brigham City, but with the completion of I-15 it was truncated to Yellowstone National Park and re- extended on a completely different alignment. In addition to a large portion of US-163, this extension absorbed several state routes: SR-33, most of SR-44, and SR-260. Route description Wilson Arch alongside US-191 near La Sal Junction US 191 & Utah Route 211 Markers US-191 enters Utah on Navajo Nation land and crosses mostly desolate parts of the state. The largest cities served by US-191 are Moab, Price and Vernal. The highway nears the level in 2 places in Utah, over Indian Summit near Price and again while crossing the Uintah Mountains near Vernal. It leaves Utah at Flaming Gorge Reservoir. US-191 directly or indirectly serves a number of parks in eastern Utah: Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Hovenweep National Monument, Natural Bridges National Monument, Capitol Reef National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Arches National Park, Dead Horse Point State Park, Dinosaur National Monument, and Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area. Church Rock, a landmark at the junction of US-191 with SR-211 Three portions of US-191 in Utah have been designated National Scenic Byways. Between U.S. Route 163 and State Route 95, US-191 forms part of the Trail of the Ancients. From Moab to Vernal, US-191 is a portion of the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway. The Flaming Gorge-Uintas Scenic Byway begins at Vernal and follows US-191 to Flaming Gorge. The state has designated the portion from Helper to Duchesne as the Indian Canyon Scenic Byway, a Utah Scenic Byway. US-191 crossing the Flaming Gorge Dam Three portions of US-191 in Utah have restrictions on trucks and other large vehicles. Between the junctions with State Routes 46 and 279, vehicles wider than are required to have two police escorts. Between Vernal and the Wyoming State line, vehicles longer than are required to have two certified pilot escorts. Vehicles heavier than per axle are prohibited on Flaming Gorge Dam. The independent portions of US 191 south of Interstate 70, as well as the concurrencies with I-70, US-6, and US-40, are included as part of the National Highway System. History When US-191 was created in 1926, it did not enter Utah, only running from Idaho Falls northeast to Yellowstone National Park. An extension in the late 1930s brought US-191 south to Brigham City, Utah, following what was then SR-41 and is now mostly SR-13.Rand McNally & Company, Texaco Road Map: Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, 1937 With the construction of I-15 parallel to US-191, the latter route was removed from Utah in the early 1970s, and by 1980 it only existed north of Yellowstone. In cooperation with Montana, Wyoming, and Arizona, the Utah Department of Transportation submitted an application to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for an extension of US-191. In Wyoming, it would replace US 187 - a single-state route, which was against current AASHTO policy — and then follow Wyoming Highway 373 to the state line. The portion in Utah replaced several state routes — State Route 260 from Wyoming to Greendale Junction, the majority of SR-44 to US-40 in Vernal, and SR-33 from US-40 in Duchesne to US-6 near Price. After overlapping US-6 past Green River, the routing followed and replaced a large portion of US-163 to a junction southwest of Bluff. Between Bluff and Mexican Water, Arizona, US-191 followed a newly constructed road across the Navajo Nation, and then replaced State Route 63, still mostly inside the reservation, to I-40 at Chambers. (It has since been continued along former US 666 to Douglas on the Mexican border.) =Arizona to US-6= The road from Bluff north via Monticello, Moab, and Valley City to Thompson (a station on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad) became a state highway in 1910.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated September 2007, accessed May 2008 To connect this road with the rest of the state highway system, a road from Valley City northwest via Floy to Green River was added in 1912, as was a connection from Thompson to via Cisco to Colorado.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated September 2007, accessed May 2008 An extension from Monticello southeast to Colorado was added in 1913, and in the 1920s most of these roadways were assigned numbers: State Route 8 went from Green River via Floy, Valley City, Thompson, and Cisco to Colorado, and State Route 9 began at Valley City and extended south via Moab to Monticello and east to Colorado.Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas, 1926 Blanding US-191 north of Moab With the creation of the U.S. Highway system in 1926, SR-8 and SR-9 each received a second designation, US-50 and U.S. Route 450 respectively.American Association of State Highway Officials, United States Numbered Highways, American Highways, April 1927 The state legislature redefined all the state routes in 1927, and moved SR-8 to a direct Floy- Thompson cutoff, with both roads from Valley City to Floy and Thompson becoming SR-9. The Monticello-Bluff road was assigned State Route 47 and extended to Mexican Hat at that time and to the Arizona state line in 1931. The State Road Commission designated a new alignment of SR-9 to Crescent Junction on SR-8 in 1934, replacing both branches to Floy and Thompsons, and the legislature updated the description in 1935; at that time, US-450 was extended from Valley City to Crescent Junction on the new SR-8 (US-50) cutoff.H.M. Gousha Company, Utah, c. 1934 Although no significant changes were made to SR-9 or SR-47 after 1935, the signed U.S. Highway numbers changed several times. First, in the late 1930s, U.S. Route 160 replaced US-450, continuing to enter the state east of Monticello and end at Crescent Junction. Then in about 1970, US-163 was designated along the entire length of SR-47 from Arizona to Monticello, and replaced US-160 north to Crescent Junction; at the same time, US-666 was extended from Cortez, Colorado over US-160 to a new terminus at US-163 in Monticello. The 1977 renumbering saw the elimination of SR-9 and SR-47, by then no longer signed due to the concurrent U.S. Highway designations. The final change (except for the 2003 renumbering of US-666 to US-491) came in 1981, when US-191 replaced US-163 north of a junction near Bluff. South of this intersection, US-191 followed a route that not formerly existed as a state highway. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) completed this road across the Navajo Nation, and San Juan County built the short piece north of the San Juan River, in time for the extension of US-191. After the BIA granted an easement to Utah for the road, formerly BIA Route N12 (23) 2&3, in 1988, it was added to the state highway system the next year. =US-6 to US-40= US-191 replaced SR-33. The road connecting Colton on SR-8 (US-50, now US-6) with SR-6 (US-40) in Duchesne became a state highway in 1910. The southwest end was moved from Colton to Castle Gate in 1912,Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated October 2007, accessed May 2008 and in 1927 it was numbered State Route 33. Few changes were made to the roadway, and in 1981 it became part of US-191. =US-40 to Wyoming= The road from SR-6 (US-40) in Vernal north to SR-43 in Manila, where one could continue to Wyoming, was added to the state highway system in about 1918 as a forest highway project,Fifth Biennial Report, State Road Commission, 1917-1918, pp. 24-25 completed in 1926,Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated October 2007, accessed May 2008 and numbered SR-44 in 1927. It was the only state road connecting Daggett County's seat, Manila, with the rest of the state, yet parts remained in an unimproved condition through the 1950s.Utah State Road Commission (Rand McNally), Utah Official Highway Map, 1956 Several routes have been designated over the years to connect SR-44 to Flaming Gorge, a canyon on the Green River that lends its name to the Flaming Gorge Dam that US-191 now crosses the river on. The first was State Route 165, which would have begun at SR-44 south of Manila and headed east to the gorge. The state legislature added the proposed road to the state highway system in 1933, but in 1935 it was deleted, and the number was reused to the west on a portion of Birch Creek Road. Later, in 1941, the planned connection was redesignated as a state highway, this time State Route 220, but in 1945 it was moved north, closer to the state line. It was this alignment that was actually built, beginning at Linwood on SR-43 and proceeding east-southeasterly through a valley that is now flooded by the Flaming Gorge Reservoir's Linwood Bay.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated October 2007, accessed May 2008, p. 5 SR-220 was deleted in 1957, but in its place was a new State Route 260 that began at Greendale Junction on SR-44 and headed northeast over the dam (then under construction) and to the state line. The legislature did not specify where it would intersect the border, and the State Road Commission initially routed it along former SR-220 to Linwood.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated September 2007, accessed May 2008, p. 31 However, the law was amended in 1963 to define the north end to be east of the reservoir, and soon the lake began to fill, cutting off the road to Linwood (and inundating that settlement).Jack Goodman, New York Times, Canyon-Country Waterway; Flaming Gorge Dam Is Forming 90-Mile Lake In Utah, Wyoming, June 27, 1965, p. XX1 By 1981 the new road was completed, and most of SR-44 and all of SR-260 were absorbed by US-191.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 US 191 from the access road at Arches National Park.

His best known work is probably Ellenpont, which translates as Counterpoint. The book explores the attempts of artificial intelligences abandoned by Man to uncover their origins and, ultimately, to rediscover mankind.  Biography  Influenced by Aldous Huxley and Aleksey Tolstoy, his ambition had been to become a writer since the age of fifteen. He was interested in astronomy, geography, geology and later in archeology. Despite all these interests he obtained a degree in music education and choir leading in 1956. Subsequently, he became a music editor and reporter at Radio Budapest from 1963 to 1967. His career in science fiction literature started in 1963. The majority of his works are science fiction novels, but he also published articles in music. In his works he examines the progression of human relations in conditions different to today's circumstances. He freely travels among the possible ways of future seeking human-like intelligence and the contact with it. This contact can lead to successful co-operation (Distant Fire), but also to involuntary tragedy (Counterpoint). In his first book, The Viking Returns, the first part of the later \\"Viking Trilogy\\", he tells the story of astronauts landing on an extrasolar planet and making contact with the inhabitants of the planet, similar to humans of the early Bronze Age. In The Mission, he describes an even closer contact: the dead astronauts' personalities revive in the brains of inhabitants of the distant planet, thus creating an exciting coexistence of differently evolved intellects sharing one body. Later, Counterpoint leads to an age after the annihilation of human civilization where self-developing robots attempt to find their origins, relying on faint memories and doubtful speculations.

By 1975, five years after its founding, the Basel show reached almost 300 exhibitors. The participating galleries came from 21 countries, attracting 37,000 visitors. Under the stewardship of Marc Spiegler, the 2019 show in Basel attracted 93,000 visitors over six days. It presented 290 galleries from 35 countries, exhibiting the work of over 4,000 artists. A total of 19 galleries showed in Basel for the very first time. Alongside private collectors from Europe, America, and Asia, representatives and groups from over 400 museums and institutions from across the world were in attendance. In 2020, the 50th edition of the fair in Basel was at first postponed to September, but later canceled after many dealers cited concerns about travel and safety. =Miami Beach, Florida= Art Basel Miami Beach was first introduced in 2002 under the direction of Sam Keller.

MCH bought it out in 2013 to create Art Basel Hong Kong, held at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.Anny Shaw (July 13, 2018), Art Basel owner to launch contemporary art fair ART SG in Singapore next year The Art Newspaper. The 2019 Hong Kong Exhibition, directed by Adeline Ooi, attracted a record attendance of 88,000 visitors, among them directors, curators, trustees, and patrons from over 130 leading international museums and institutions. On display were 242 galleries from 35 countries and territories. The 2020 edition of the fair was cancelled due to the spread of coronavirus.Scott Reyburn (February 6, 2020), Art Basel Cancels Hong Kong Fair The New York Times Initiatives Art Basel's initiatives concentrate on the broader art world. Art Basel has three main initiatives: Art Basel Cities, BMW Art Journey, Crowdfunding and The Art Market. Art Basel Cities is a project between Art Basel and cities worldwide to create cultural events and programming throughout the year. Art Basel, the city's local art stakeholders and the city's officials will sit together and develop a program in line with the city's mid- and long-term cultural development goals. This initiative was launched during the 2016 Hong Kong edition of Art Basel. Cities interested in the collaboration have to apply via an online questionnaire. The first partner city is Buenos Aires. BMW Art Journey Award is a grant that supports emerging creatives and enables them to go on an artistic journey of their own definition. In 2015, it was established by BMW and Art Basel to reward promising artists from the Discoveries sector in Hong Kong and the Positions sector in Miami Beach. The chosen artist can select the destination and go almost anywhere in the world to explore new ideas, discover new themes, and create new works. A winner is selected twice a year from a shortlist of three finalists during the Art Basel shows in Hong Kong and Miami Beach. The Crowdfunding Initiative is a partnership between Kickstarter and Art Basel to provide visibility and generate support for projects from non-profit organizations around the world. The projects include artist residencies, education programs, public installations and other innovative artistic projects. They are selected by an independent jury made up of three non-profit art world specialists. The Art Market is an annual global art market analysis. It covers all aspects of the international market and highlights the most important developments in the previous year. The first report was published in 2017. Also, the executive-education program Collecting Contemporary Art in Hong Kong was launched by Art Basel, HKU SPACE Centre for Degree Programmes (CDP) and Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design (CSM).

It is usually available in densities between 50–90 g/m2. It is translucent unless dyes are added to color it or make it opaque. It is manufactured by supercalendering: after pressing and drying, the paper web is passed through a stack of alternating steel- and fiber-covered rolls called a supercalender at the end of the paper machine such that the paper fibers flatten facing in the same direction. Usage Glassine is most commonly used as a base for further silicone coating for manufacture of release liner. Glassine is also employed as an interleaving paper in bookbinding, especially to protect fine illustrations from contact with facing pages; the paper can be manufactured with a neutral pH, and can prevent damage from spilling, exposure, or rubbing. Glassine adhesive tape has been used in book repair. In chemistry, glassine is used as an inexpensive weighing paper. It is used in foodservice as a barrier between strips of products (for example: meat, baked goods). Glassine is resistant to grease and facilitates separation of individual foodstuffs. Glassine has been recommended for protecting the surface of stored acrylic paintings.The Acrylic book - A comprehensive resource for Artists © Liquitex Artist Materials 2007 However, glassine will adhere to soft (not completely cured) and medium-rich paint, especially when stored for an extended period of time, and it may cause permanent damage to the painted surface. Therefore, art conservators do not recommend that it be used to wrap paintings. Philatelists use glassine envelopes to store stamps, and stamp hinges are made of glassine.Stamp hinges aren't perfect, but they do help Michael Baadke Amateur insect collectors use glassine envelopes to store specimens temporarily in the field before they are mounted in a collection. Entomologists collecting for research may likewise use such envelopes to store whole specimens in the field. Glassine envelopes are used to carry pharmacy reformulated drugs and illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin. In the mid-20th century, potato chips were packaged in glassine bags.Burhans, Dirk E. (2008). Crunch: A History of the Great American Potato Chip, p.33. Terrace Books, Madison Wi. . Glassine is also used to pack firecrackers, as it is moisture resistant. It is used for its transparent qualities to fold origami tessellations. Glassine is an outer covering on paperboard tubes, particularly those used in model rocketry, for water protection.

pads or patches that manufacturers claim can dramatically improve health when placed under the feet during sleep. Some of these pads may contain ingredients such as \\"distilled bamboo vinegar\\" that allegedly pull toxins from the body, but critics have shown that the process is not scientifically viable.Ridding Yourself of Toxins, or Money?, ABC News 11 April 2008, retrieved 17 July 2014 On January 3, 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an urgent warningFDA warning, January 3, 2008 regarding the potential dangers of many imported pharmaceutical substances including several brands of detox foot patches. In April 2008, in response to questions from the Associated Press, an FDA spokeswoman said regarding the agency's investigation of the claims made for Kinoki foot pads that \\"basically, when we open up a case it means that the violation might be in terms of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, such as when (product makers) make false, misleading claims.\\" FDA launches Kinoki Foot Pad inquiry, Associated Press, 14 April 2008, retrieved 16 July 2014 In August 2008, National Public Radio commissioned a laboratory test to look for heavy metals in used pads, which Kinoki claims are extracted from the body. The test found none. NPR also discovered that the pads change from white to grey when they are exposed to moisture, including sweat, and not necessarily because they are absorbing other substances.Japanese Foot Pad Is Latest Health Fad by Sarah Varney. NPR, All Things Considered, 18 August 2008.

Kenrico Research & Peer Review Studies. Retrieved 13 June 2014. There is no evidence that these products work and although the skin is one of the bodies largest organs of detoxification, there is no proposed mechanism as to why these patches would increase the detoxification rate above baseline. Skeptics While the detoxification foot pads seem to be popular among young populations in some regions, the effect of the pads remains unclear. \\"Removing heavy metals from the body\\" seems to be good for health, however, human body needs certain amount of heavy metals such as zinc, iron, copper, etc. Excessive amount of heavy metal can cause disease. Although absorption through skin is one of the ways for human body to take in heavy metals, it is not clear if the heavy metal molecules can be pulled out of the body through skin. The circadian rhythm is not proven to be related to the heavy metal detox, either. There is no evidence proving that bamboo vinegar has the function of attracting heavy metals. On the other hand, detoxification foot pads can not accurately control how much heavy metal to be “detoxicated” from the body. The pads have no evidence of identifying what they claim to remove, or the way of measuring its level in body. https://quackwatch.org/device/reports/kinoki/ No studies have been done to measure the amount of accumulated heavy metal on the pad after it’s been left overnight. The Japanese company Kinoki claimed their foot pad to be able to cause weight loss by removing toxins, metabolic wastes, heavy metals and chemical from the body. Kinoki also claimed that the pads can treat varies kinds of disease including headaches, depression, even a weakened immune system. It was proven by the U.S District Court for the District of New Jersey that those claims were unsupported.https://www.ftc.gov/news- events/press-releases/2010/11/ftcs-request-judge-imposes-ban-marketers-detox- foot-pads See alsoReferences Category:Alternative detoxification Category:Pseudoscience ","title":"Detoxification foot pads"},{"id":"15110710","text":"U.S. Route 6 (US 6) is a transcontinental highway in the United States, stretching from Bishop, California, in the west to Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the east coast. The Nevada portion crosses the center of the state, serving the cities of Tonopah and Ely, en route to Utah and points further east. Like US 50, to the north, large desolate areas are traversed by the route, with few or no signs of civilization, and the highway crosses several large desert valleys separated by numerous mountain ranges towering over the valley floors, in what is known as the Basin and Range Province of the Great Basin. US 6 has a diverse route through the state, traversing desert, desert mountain ranges and valleys, ghost towns and Great Basin National Park. The entire highway in Nevada is designated as part of the Grand Army of the Republic Highway, and has also been named the Theodore Roosevelt Highway. Although US 50 to the north is known as The Loneliest Road in America, US 6 can be considered as equally deserving of that title due to it serving equally desolate areas. The route was routed entirely over existing state highways when it was extended into Nevada in 1937; however, all of the concurrent state routes were eventually removed. The route has remained largely unchanged, except where it was realigned to enter Utah north of Baker instead of passing through the town. Route description From the California border, US 6 heads northeast through semidesert Queen Valley with Boundary Peak (Nevada), Nevada's highest summit, and Montgomery Peak in California on the right. These twin peaks are the northernmost high summits of the White Mountains, both over . The highway then climbs into the Pinyon–Juniper zone and crosses Montgomery Pass . US 6 & US 95 in Tonopah, Nevada From the pass, US 6 descends into barren shadscale desert, passing Columbus Salt Marsh on the left, then merging with US 95 from Coaldale to Tonopah. Nevada Test and Training Range begins about southeast of Tonopah. Just east of Tonopah, US 6 continues east across a series of desert mountain ranges and valleys, including the Monitor Range. At Warm Springs, State Route 375, also known as the \\"Extraterrestrial Highway\\", departs to the southeast and US 6 assumes a northeasterly alignment across the Reveille, Pancake, Grant and White Pine Ranges. Rainfall increases eastward, so valleys become less barren and peaks over add scenic interest. Ely is the largest town on U.S. Route 6 in Nevada. US 50 joins U.S. Route 6 at Ely. East of Ely, U.S. Routes 6 and 50 cross the Schell Creek Range, known for verdant forests and meadows, and for a large deer and elk population. The highway descends to Spring Valley, then crosses the Snake Range at Sacramento Pass, north of Nevada's second-highest mountain, Wheeler Peak, where a branch road accesses Great Basin National Park. Beyond the pass, US 6 passes just north of Baker, a Mormon farming community and reaches the Utah state line. U.S. Route 6, 50 and 93 concurrency in Ely There are no services anywhere between Tonopah and Ely (a distance of about 168 miles). Although US 50 has the nickname \\"The Loneliest Road in America\\", US 6 has a solid case for the title; as Tonopah and Ely are the only cities it goes through in the it traverses in Nevada, with a combined population of just over 6,500, while US 50 boasts Carson City with over 50,000 and even Fallon alone out populates US 6, with over 8,000. In addition, there is not much traffic for US 6, as it ends south of the California and Nevada state line in the small town of Bishop, California at US 395 (with connections to the former western terminus of US 6 in Long Beach). The most heavily traveled portion of US 6 is the portion that is concurrent with US 95, as the latter route connects Las Vegas and Reno, the two largest metropolitan areas in Nevada. History US 6 was one of the original U.S. highways in the 1925 Bureau of Public Roads plan. It was commissioned in 1926, but was not extended west into Nevada until 1937. The alignment of US 6 in Nevada has remained largely unchanged since then. US 6 was routed entirely over existing state highways in Nevada. Between the California state line west of Montgomery Pass to Basalt, the highway was concurrently routed with State Route 10. From Basalt to Coaldale, the highway was concurrently routed with State Route 15. From Coaldale to Tonopah, the highway was concurrently routed with State Route 3. From Tonopah to Ely, the highway was concurrently routed with State Route 4 (also called the Midland Trail). From Ely to present-day Majors Place, the highway was concurrently routed with US 93 and State Route 7. From Major's Place to the Utah state line southeast of Baker, the highway was concurrently routed with State Route 14. All of the concurrent state routes were removed from US 6 by 1939 except for SR 3 between Coaldale and Tonopah. Also, US 6 was realigned to enter Utah north of Baker instead of passing through the town. In 1940, SR 3 was replaced by US 95 between Coaldale and Tonopah. In 1954, US 50 was realigned between Ely and the Utah border and was concurrently routed over US 6.

The company was founded on August 30, 1897 by William Alden Smith, a Republican politician and former general counsel of both the Chicago and West Michigan Railway and the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad. The GRK&S; constructed a line from northern Missaukee County through Kalkaska (crossing the Grand Rapids & Indiana) to Rapid City, where it met the C&WM;'s main line. The C&WM; undertook to supply rolling stock and oversee construction in exchange for a 10-year lease of the line.The only reported end point is Stratford, which does not appear on modern maps. Given the length of the line, and sources concerning the abandoned grade and line crossings, the most likely location is Norwich. See Ivey (1919), 246; Livingstone (1900), 361-362; Interstate Commerce Commission (1917), 35-37; and The C&WM;'s lease of the GRK&S; was continued by the Pere Marquette Railway following the consolidation of 1899. In 1903, however, the PM bought the capital stock of the GRK&S.;Michigan Tax Commission (1903), 59; Interstate Commerce Commission (1917), 37; Meints (1992), 185. See however Michigan Railroad Commission (1906), 27, which discusses a possible grade crossing east of Rapid City of the GRK&S;, and not the Pere Marquette. The line does not appear to have been particularly profitable; it mainly transported lumber, the quantity of which declined over the next decade. In 1915 a Pere Marquette official lamented the poor state of the line: > It is bad. There are 14 miles of the track from Eastman Junction to the end > at Stratford that is so bad that we operate it under caution and I am about > to ask the railroad commission for the authority to take it up. There is no > business on the branch to warrant our continuing in operation and we are now > going up there twice a week to bring out what little business there > is.Interstate Commerce Commission (1917), 37. Abandonment followed swiftly. In 1916 the Pere Marquette cut the line back to Spencer, eliminating the which had so concerned it. In 1918 it pulled back to Kalkaska, another . Finally, in 1921, it abandoned the stretch between Kalkaska and Rapid City, removing the last vestige of the Grand Rapids, Kalkaska and Southeastern.

His great-uncle was Meyer Schapiro.David Yezzi, 'An interview with Jacob Collins', in The New Criterion, December 2011 As a child, he started copying works by Old Masters in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. From a young age, Collins knew that he wanted to be an artist, although his interest and skill lay in a classical style that was out of favor in the late 20th century. Moving away from Modernism, he identified instead with works of 15th-19th century masters and their techniques and aesthetics. Red Head, Oil on Canvas, 30 × 40 inches, 2004, by Jacob Collins He studied in Europe and at the New York Studio School following his graduation from The Dalton School.

US 95 is cosigned with Interstate 80 for between a junction in Trinity and Winnemucca before heading north into Oregon at McDermitt. At 646 miles, it is the longest highway in Nevada. Along much of its course through Nevada, US 95 has signs designating it as the Veterans Memorial Highway. A portion of the route in Las Vegas northwest of downtown is also called the Oran K. Gragson Freeway, named for the Las Vegas mayor who advocated for construction of that portion of freeway in the 1960s. Route description U.S. Route 95 enters Nevada near Cal-Nev-Ari in Clark County and heads north towards Railroad Pass, where it meets Interstate 11 and US 93. The three routes are then co-signed in the Las Vegas Valley and east of Henderson, I-11 and I-515 are co-signed with US 93/95 for its entire route around the eastern Las Vegas Valley. I-11 ends at the Henderson Spaghetti Bowl (also known as the Hender-Bender) interchange of Interstate 215 and SR 564 and Interstate 515 begins. The freeway then heads west into Downtown Las Vegas, where it intersects Interstate 15. At the Spaghetti Bowl interchange, US 93 follows I-15 northbound and I-515 ends. US 95 heads west, then north at the Rainbow Curve. The freeway portion then ends at Corn Creek Road northwest of the Las Vegas Valley and then it becomes a brief four-lane divided highway. US 95 exits Clark County and heads into eastern Nye County for 107 miles. The four-lane divided highway ends past the Mercury interchange. It then enters Esmeralda and continues for 44 miles before meeting US 6 in Tonopah, back in Nye County. US 6/95 leave Tonopah, after two miles, enters Esmeralda County again and heads west for until Coaldale, where US 6 splits west towards California and its western terminus at US 395 in Bishop, California. US 95 then heads northwest towards Hawthorne and Schurz, where US 95 Alternate splits west towards US 50, providing an alternate route towards Carson City and Reno. US 95 itself goes north towards Fallon, where it intersects US 50. US 95 meets Interstate 80 and US 95 Alternate about halfway between Lovelock and Fernley. The two routes then run concurrently for until reaching Winnemucca, where US 95 splits from I-80 and follows Interstate 80 Business into downtown Winnemucca. In downtown Winnemucca, US 95 turns north in the general direction of Paradise Valley, leaving Interstate 80 Business to follow SR 289 east. North of Winnemucca, US 95 meets the eastern terminus of SR 140, which connects to Lakeview (U.S. Route 395) and Klamath Falls, Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. US 95 finally exits Nevada at McDermitt and heads into Oregon.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed December 2007 via ACME Mapper History I-80/US 95 concurrency near Winnemucca =Extension into Nevada= When the original plan for the U.S. highway system was adopted by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) in 1926, US 95 was one of the routes created. At that time, however, the route only existed in Idaho from the Canada–United States border near Eastport to Weiser near the Oregon state line. A proposal to extend US 95 south to Winnemucca was considered by AASHO in 1937; however, action was deferred due to incomplete sections in Oregon. AASHO reconsidered the idea at its meeting on June 28, 1939, as part of a larger plan to extend the highway south to Blythe, California. This plan was adopted, officially establishing US 95 throughout Nevada effective January 1, 1940. The route was marked along several preexisting state highways as follows: *From the Oregon state line at McDermitt, US 95 followed State Route 8 for to Winnemucca. *At Winnemucca, the route joined U.S. Route 40 (State Route 1), traveling southwest via Lovelock to Fernley. *In Fernley, US 95 followed State Route 2 for to Fallon (with a short overlap on U.S. Route 50 west of Fallon). *The highway turned south at Fallon, running concurrently with the southern segment of State Route 1A to Schurz. *At Schurz, US 95 was routed along State Route 3, zigzagging south and east through Hawthorne, Luning, Coaldale, Tonopah and Goldfield (including an overlap with U.S. Route 6 between Coaldale and Tonopah). *South of Goldfield, the highway overlapped the entire of State Route 5, traveling southeast through Beatty and Indian Springs to Las Vegas, joining U.S. Route 93/U.S. Route 466 through Henderson to Boulder City, then splitting from US 93/466 heading south through Searchlight towards the California state line en route to Needles. The Nevada portion of US 95 covered a distance of approximately . The entire route was on paved roads, except for a small portion of SR 5 between the California state line and Searchlight. I-80 Bus./US 95 concurrency in downtown Winnemucca =Fallon to Winnemucca realignment= When U.S. Route 95 was designated through Nevada, it avoided using a shorter alignment between Winnemucca and Fallon. The northern segment of State Route 1A had been previously established running north from Fallon to connect with US 40 southwest of Lovelock. At the time, however, this portion of SR 1A was mostly an unimproved road. State Route 1A had been completely paved by 1959, and the US 95 designation was moved over it by 1960. This new alignment eliminated the need to drive west to Fernley and then double back eastward, shortening the highway's length by about . When US 95 was realigned, the former route via Fernley was redesignated as alternate route. This would be the second highway to bear this designation, as another U.S. Route 95 Alternate had been created between Schurz and Fernley years earlier. The two separate alternate routes would continue to meet in Fernley until circa 1978, when U.S. Route 50 Alternate replaced the section of US 95 Alternate (original US 95) heading east towards Fallon. View from US 95 near Tonopah, Nevada =Improvements in the Las Vegas metro area= When US 95 was extended through the Las Vegas Valley around 1940, it used the existing roadways traversed by State Route 5. Crossing the valley from the southeast, the U.S. highway traveled along Boulder Highway (now SR 582) through Henderson and the town of Whitney. Reaching the city limits of Las Vegas, the road changed names to Fremont Street as it headed into downtown. The route followed Las Vegas Boulevard northward briefly before going west on Bonanza Road (now SR 579). US 95 finally turned northwest on Rancho Drive (now SR 599), which became the Tonopah Highway as it traveled northwest out of the Vegas valley. (\\"Clark County 1952 004\\" ZIP file contains map image.) Over the years, this routing of US 95 along city streets would slowly be replaced with newer, high-speed facilities. US 95 in Beatty, Nevada Las Vegas Expressway Elected in 1959, Las Vegas mayor Oran K. Gragson began advocating for regional street and planning initiatives in the growing Las Vegas Valley. In the early 1960s, Gragson had become instrumentally involved in planning what was then referred to as the \\"West Fremont Expressway\\". By 1968, the expressway was beginning to take shape, beginning at Las Vegas Boulevard downtown, interchanging with Interstate 15 and spurring west towards Rancho Drive. Northbound US 95 between Beatty and Scotty's Junction The Las Vegas Expressway was slowly constructed over the next decade, reaching west to Rainbow Boulevard by 1978. A northward extension, linking the expressway to the Tonopah Highway northwest of downtown was completed around 1980. By 1982, US 95 was moved from Rancho Drive to the completed expressway alignment. Also in 1982, as the result of a petition drive, the new US 95 expressway was renamed to the \\"Oran K. Gragson Expressway\\" in honor of the four-term mayor. The Nevada Department of Transportation now recognizes this portion of US 95 as the \\"Oran K. Gragson Freeway\\". I-15, I-515 and US 93 in Las Vegas in 2015 Henderson spur The first section of the future I-515 freeway in Las Vegas opened from the east end of the 1968-era Las Vegas Expressway at Las Vegas Boulevard to Charleston Boulevard in 1984. It was extended south to Boulder Highway (at current exit 70) by 1986. US 95 was moved from Las Vegas Boulevard, Fremont Street, and Boulder Highway onto the new freeway at that time. As additional sections of freeway were completed, both US 95 and the concurrently routed US 93 were moved to the new facility. The I-515 designation was added in 1990, but not widely signed until the completion of the entire freeway to just north of Railroad Pass in 1994. The former alignment on Fremont Street and Boulder Highway is now SR 582, though some portions of that route are now being decommissioned by the state and turned over to local entities for maintenance. In May 2006, the (freeway-to- freeway) interchange was completed to replace the former diamond junction at Lake Mead Parkway/SR 564 (formerly known as Lake Mead Drive) and the I-215/Bruce Woodbury Beltway. The interchange at Galleria Drive (exit 64B) was opened on November 4, 2009, resulting in the renumbering of the existing junction at Sunset Road (from exit 64 to exit 64A). In May 2020, an earthquake damaged the highway. Future US 95 is part of a proposed northwestward extension of Interstate 11 (I-11) from Las Vegas. The interstate highway would primarily follow the US 95 corridor through central and northwestern Nevada, extending to I-80 near Reno and Sparks via Tonopah. In 2018, the Nevada Department of Transportation had initiated public outreach regarding its long- range planning efforts to narrow down options for the future I-11 corridor. Future I-11 corridor signs were installed in both directions from CC 215 to Kyle Canyon Road in 2019. Major intersections Note: Mileposts in Nevada reset at county lines.

He was born in Bavaria, Germany, and immigrated to the United States in 1938. He is best known for his large canvas paintings and highly detailed lithographs that were inspired by calligraphic writing. Wilke was deeply intrigued by the written language, and much of his work was derived from his abstract interpretation of the shapes, colors and meanings of writing that he found in all languages and forms, including the poetry and ancient engravings of Asia and the Middle East. He was an avid art collector, particularly of tribal art, and was the founding director of the University of Iowa Museum of Art. Wilke studied art at Harvard on a Carnegie scholarship before being drafted into the US Army in 1942. In 1947, he completed his master's degree in Art at the University of Iowa. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Wilke was an art teacher and director at several universities and museums. He received the Guggenheim Fellowship twice (in 1959 and 1960), which he used to travel to work and study first in Munich and Rome, and later Kyoto, Japan where he lived in monastery and studied Japanese Zen calligraphy under the monks. Wilke returned to the US in the 1960s. He lived in New York City at this time and worked as a professor at Rutgers University. This period defined Wilke as an artist, and it was during this time that he became connected to the great New York school of artists of the 1950s and 1960s. He maintained close relationships with many famed artist colleagues including Ad Reinhardt, Julius Bissier, George Rickey, Mark Rothko, Lyonel Feininger, Max Beckmann, Mark Tobey, Kenzo Okada, Robert Motherwell and David Smith. In 1968, Wilke's reputation as an art collector earned him a position as founding director of the University of Iowa Art Museum. He served as museum director there until relocating to Hawaii in 1978. Wilke had many solo exhibitions throughout the United States and internationally, and was awarded many honors, including an exhibition and award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. A few of the museums holding Wilke’s work in their collections today include the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Chicago Art Institute, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Columbus Museum of Art, Dayton Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum, New York University Art Center, Philadelphia Museum, Museum of Tel Aviv, Honolulu Academy of Arts, University of Iowa Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Milwaukee Art Museum, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and the Stanford University Museum of Art.

The diocese is the metropolitan of the Diocese of Pécs and the Diocese of Szeged–Csanád. Its patron saint is Saint Paul. The current archbishop is Balázs Bábel, who was appointed in 1999. History=Establishment= In his monography about the early history of the Archbishopric of Kalocsa, the Hungarian historian László Koszta concludes that the \\"establishment of the Diocese of Kalocsa is one of the most debated issues of our ecclesiastic history in the Age of the Árpáds\\". Indeed, several important details of the early history of the episcopal see are uncertain. The date of its establishment is unknown; its early statusa bishopric, a metropolitan archdiocese or an archbishopric without suffragan bishopsis obscure; its first (arch)bishop is uncertain; and its connection with the see of Bács (now Bač, Serbia) is debated. According to Hartvik, an early-12th-century biographer of the first king of Hungary, Stephen I, the king \\"divided his territories into ten bishoprics\\", making the archbishopric of Esztergom \\"the metropolitan and master of the others\\", and bestowed \\"the dignity of the bishop of Kalocsa\\" on Abbot Astrik. Astrik, continued Hartvik, was appointed to the see of Esztergom to substitute Archbishop Sebastian who had gone blind, but Asterik \\"returned to Kalocsa with the pallium\\" (the archbishops' specific vestment) when Sebastian received back his sight three years later. Stephen's earlier hagiography, the longer version of the Life of Saint Stephen, King of Hungary, did not mention this episode and exclusively referred to Astrik as archbishop of Esztergom. The cathedral church at Kalocsa was dedicated to Paul the Apostle who was renowned especially for his missionary activities. The patron saint implies that the see was established as a missionary bishopric, possibly aimed at the conversion of the so-called Black Hungarians (as it is proposed by historian Gábor Thoroczkay). Most historians developed their views about the establishment of the see on Hartvic's report. They accept that the see of Kalocsa was set up as a bishopric shortly after Stephen I's coronation in the first decade of the 11th century. According to a scholarly hypothesis, not only the lands between the rivers Danube and Tisza, but also the southern region of Transdanubia (the future Diocese of Pécs), and the Banat (which later developed into the Diocese of Csanád) were included in the new bishopric. One George was the first archbishop mentioned in a contemporaneous source: in 1050 or 1051 he was one of the prelates who assisted Pope Leo IX to celebrate a mass in Lotharingia. The Archdiocese of Kalocsa was probably originally set up as a Bishopric by King Stephen I of Hungary, but it became the second Archbishopric in 1009. Its original suffragans were the bishops of Bihar () and Transylvania. Around 1028 the bishop of the newly established Diocese of Csanád also became a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Kalocsa. Secular offices connected to the archbishopric The Archbishops of Kalocsa were, from the 15th century to 1776, the perpetual counts (, Latin: Bacsiensis perpetuus supremus comes).

The majority of the route was located in the Regional Municipality of Peel; however, the section in Orangeville was in Dufferin County. The route of Highway 136 was originally part of Highway 24; it was created in 1962 when Highway 24 was rerouted along Highway 51\\\\. The highway remained unchanged until 1997, when it was transferred to the Regional Municipality of Peel and the Town of Orangeville. The majority of the former highway is rural in nature, passing through farmland on the highlands of the Niagara Escarpment, located a short distance south of the southern terminus of the route. Near its northern terminus, the surrounds are suburban as the highway enters Orangeville. The only notable community on the route other than Orangeville is Alton.  Route description  Highway 136 was a short route through the northern section of Caledon. The former route is mostly rural, surrounded by the expanse of farmland that sits atop the Niagara Escarpment. The route follows several concession roads along its length, and is known locally by the names of those roads today. It begins at a junction with former Highway 24 (Charleston Sideroad) immediately north of Forks of the Credit Provincial Park, which straddles the escarpment northwest of Brampton. The route proceeds northwest alongside the Charles Sauriol Conservation Area for approximately before entering the community of Alton. Within Alton, the route follows Main Street until a broad 90° curve directs traffic northeast onto Queen Street. It follows this road out of the community, encountering a railway crossing and the Credit River at the town limits. The route takes another 90° curve to the northwest, intersecting Porterfield Road, after which the route takes that name. It crosses the same railway line and proceeds north for between farm fields. South of Orangeville, the route intersects the Orangeville Bypass (Riddell Road), after which the farmland transitions to suburbs. It takes a broad curves to the northeast and becomes Townline Road, which acts as the boundary between Peel Region and Dufferin County as well as the town limits of Orangeville. After following this road for a kilometre, it intersects John Street. The final section of the route follows John Street northwest to end at former Highway 9 (Broadway).  History  While the route dates back to 1962 as Highway 136, it is a former alignment of Highway 24, which was re-routed along Highway 51 towards Highway 10 that year. The road was first designated on February 10, 1937 as part of an extension of Highway 24 north from Guelph to Collingwood via Orangeville. Highway 136 was a gravel road at the time of the renumbering. The section between Cataract and Alton was paved first, in 1965; this was followed by the section between Alton and Orangeville in 1966. The primary purpose of Highway 136 as a provincial highway was to maintain the former routing of Highway 24. However, as the route served a generally local and regional need, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario transferred responsibility for signage and maintenance of the highway to the Regional Municipality of Peel and Town of Orangeville on April 1, 1997, at which point the majority of it was designated Peel Regional Road 25.PW-A3 To avoid confusing motorists and to make the regional route numbers consistent with former provincial route numbers, Peel redesignated several roads on March 26, 1998.

It describes the struggles endured by the son of a wealthy land-owner, Fugui, while historical events caused and extended by the Chinese Revolution are fundamentally altering the nature of Chinese society. The contrast between his pre-revolutionary status as a selfish rich idler who (literally) travels on the shoulders of the downtrodden and his post-revolutionary status as a persecuted peasant are stark. Described by one scholar as a “revisionist retelling of the history of modern China” with a “sense of the malign unpredictability of history”, To Live is one of the most representative works by Yu Hua. The story begins with the narrator traveling through the countryside to collect folk songs and local legends and hears an old peasant's life story, which encompass many significant historical events in China including the Land Reform, Great Leap Forward, Great Chinese Famine, Three- anti and Five-anti Campaigns and the Cultural Revolution. Over the course of the story, the main character, Xu Fugui, witnesses the death of his family members and loved ones. The book was originally published in the Shanghai literary journal Harvest. A film rendition, directed by Zhang Yimou, was released in 1994. The novel has also been adapted into a television series and stage play. The novel has been translated into traditional Chinese, French, Dutch, Italian, Korean, German, Japanese, English, Swedish, Romanian and Malayalam.  Writing Background  Yu Hua was inspired and deeply moved by the American folk song ‘Old Black Joe’. Despite experiencing hardships in life and the passing of his family, the elderly black slave still looked upon the world with eyes of kindness, offering not the slightest complaint. This American slave song with the simplest lyrics formed the story of Fugui's life - a life imbued with upheavals and suffering, but also tranquillity and happiness. It was after listening to this song that Yu Hua decided to write his next novel To Live.  Synopsis  Going to the countryside to collect popular folk songs, the narrator “I” meets an old man named Xu Fugui, who begins to recount his story. Fugui is the son of a landlord. After squandering his family’s fortune in gambling dens and brothels and the sudden death of his father, Fugui settles down to do the honest work of a farmer. Soon his mother becomes ill, and going into town to purchase medicine, he finds himself forcibly conscripted into the Nationalist Army. Leaving behind his family, he witnesses the horrors and privations of the Chinese Civil War. Upon returning home years later, Fugui learns that his mother has died and a high fever has left his daughter Fengxia deaf and mute. He begins to face a string of hardships as he witnesses one after another the death of his family members. His only son, Youqing dies due to medical negligence while donating blood to save the magistrate’s wife. Years later, Fengxia finds a suitable husband Erxi, who too has a disability--a crooked head. Their happy life ends when Fengxia dies from giving birth to their son Kugen. Soon, Fugui’s wife Jiazhen dies of osteomalacia and Erxi dies in a construction accident. Finally, even Fugui’s remaining family member, Kugen dies as he chokes to death while eating beans. Having saved up enough money, Fugui buys an old ox, who serves as his companion during his final years.

So there is really no place for ideas like \\"resistance\\" in Fugui's mind—he lives simply to live. In this world I have never met anyone who has as much respect for life as Fugui.

Awards  *Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2004) *Grinzane Cavour Prize (1998)  Adaptations  Film A film adaption (To Live) of this book starring well-known actors such as Gong Li and Ge You was released in 1994, premiering at the New York Film Festival, after numerous discussions between film director Zhang Yimou and the novelist author Yu Hua upon the proper film adaptation, keeping the plot within the frame of Yu Hua's artistic vision. Yu Hua has previously stated that he prefers his own novel to the film. The film changes the setting from rural southern China to a small city in northern China and added the element of shadow puppetry. The second narrator and the ox are not present in the film.[1] Michael Berry, the translator of the English edition of the novel To Live, said that the novel has a \\"darker and more existential\\" message and a \\"much more brutal\\" reality and social critique, while the film renders the failure of Communist ideals and capitalist China as a more optimistic future.[1] Berry says that the film \\"allows more room for the hand of fate to hold sway.\\"[1] Just like the novel, the movie was first banned in China, and was not theatrically released because it was viewed by the government to be an anti-Communist campaign. Television Series On December 16, 2005, the 33-episode television series adaptation, Fugui 富贵 was broadcast on Chinese television. Directed by Zhu Zheng, the TV series features lesser known actors and actresses such as Chen Chuang (陈创) as Fugui and Liu Mintao (刘敏涛) as Jiazhen. Stage Play Two decades after the novel's release, it was adapted into a stage play titled To Live 活着 directed by influential contemporary drama director, Meng Jinghui (孟京辉) and starring actors Huang Bo (黄渤) as Fugui and Yuan Quan (袁泉) as Jiazhen. The play premiered at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing between September 4, 2012 to September 9, 2012, and later made its way to cities such as Hangzhou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Taipei.  Critical Reviews  “A work of astounding emotional power.” —Dai Sijie, author of Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress “A Chinese Book of Job, To Live is a heart-wrenching saga, written with beauty, defiance, and hope. Yu Hua’s books deserve a place on the highest shelf.” —Wang Ping, author of Aching for Beauty and Foreign Devil “A major contemporary novelist, Yu Hua writes with a cold eye but a warm heart. His novels are ingeniously structured and exude a mythical aura. Though unmistakably Chinese, they are universally resonant.” —Ha Jin, author of Waiting “A book of subtle power and poignant drama. You love Yu Hua’s characters because they are flawed, vibrant, soulful, and real: you celebrate with them the small wonders of life, and feel their pain as they overcome tragedy. Ultimately, To Live is a redemptive story of the human spirit, one that is universal in its emotional depth.” –Terrence Cheng, author of Sons of Heaven “Yu Hua is the most profound voice coming out of China today. To Live reaches not only into the very essence of the Chinese people but into the blood and bones core of what it means to be a human being.” Lisa See, author of On Gold Mountain  See also  Translations In 1994, Scmp Book Publishing Ltd and Rye Field Publishing Co. published the traditional Chinese version.

The Yeoman was available in two models, a two-door and a four- door, both with six-passenger seating capacity. Based on the Delray passenger car series, the Yeoman represented the entry-level selections in the 1958 Chevrolet station wagon lineup, which also included the Brookwood and the Nomad. Design For 1958, Chevrolet models were redesigned longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors. The first ever production Chevrolet big block V8, the , was now an option. Chevrolet's design for the year fared better than its other GM offerings, and lacked the overabundance of chrome found on Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs. Complementing Chevrolet's front design was a broad grille and quad headlights that helped simulate a 'Baby Cadillac'; the wagon's tail received a fan-shaped alcove on both side panels, similar to the sedan's, but wagon's housed single tail lights instead of dual (triple on Impala) to accommodate the tailgate. Despite being a recession year, sales increased and overtook Ford, which held the top position in 1957) and the Bel Air the most popular Chevrolet model. The Nomad station wagon name also reappeared in 1958 when the vehicle became as the premium four-door Chevrolet station wagon, rather than the two-door designs of the 1955-57 Nomads. Most Chevrolet station wagon models had two tail lights housed in abbreviated alcoves, which were made smaller to accommodate the rear gate. A new dash was used. The value of a drag coefficient for 1958 Chevy wagons is estimated by a-c, is Cd = 0.6. The Delray-based Yeoman was the lowest version and featured minimal interior and exterior trim and limited options. Safety 1958 Chevrolet brochure wagon body cutaway The Yeoman featured Chevrolet's new \\"Safety-Girder\\" cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these \\"x-frames\\" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member. This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.

The Yeoman was dropped (along with the Delray) at the end of 1958. For 1959, Chevrolet's Brookwood would now offer a 2-door wagon and become the lowest priced station wagon.

It is a heterocyclic compound, the smallest cyclic organic peroxide. The compound itself is highly unstable and has never been observed at room temperature. Derivatives in which the hydrogens are replaced by other functional groups are called dioxiranes, and may be more stable. Some of them, such as dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) and the more reactive methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane, are used in organic synthesis as oxidizing reagents, most notably as the key catalytic intermediate in the Shi epoxidation reaction. Difluorodioxirane, which boils at about –80 to –90 °C, is one of the very few dioxirane derivatives that is stable in pure form at room temperature. Synthesis Dioxirane is highly unstable and the majority of studies of it have been computational; it has been detected during the low temperature (-196 °C) reaction of ethylene and ozone, although even at these temperatures such a mixture can be explosive. Its formation is thought to be radical in nature, preceding via a Criegee intermediate. Microwave analysis has indicated C-H, C-O and O-O bond lengths of 1.090, 1.388 and 1.516 Å respectively. The very long and weak O-O bond (c.f. hydrogen peroxide O-O = 1.47 Å) is the origin of its instability.

The length of the event can be as short as 2–3 days for a cross-country baja to as long as 15 days with marathon rallies like the Dakar Rally; with other cross-country rally events lasting 4–5 days. With skill in navigation being key, the driving skill and endurance of riders, drivers, co-drivers, and machines are put to the test. The total distance covered can be anywhere between 600 km to over 5,000 km with terrain ranging from sandy dunes, forest roads, mountain roads, and dry river beds; among others. The most well known rally raid is the Dakar Rally; a marathon rally which can last anywhere from 10–15 days. Other prominent marathon rallies include the Africa Eco Race and Silk Way Rally. Well known examples of cross-country rallies include the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge and Rallye du Maroc. The Baja Aragón is an example of a cross-country baja with the Baja Russia Northern Forest taking place entirely in snow. Other examples of rally raid races include the TransAnatolia Rally Raid, Hellas Rally Raid, Borneo Rally Raid, and Raid De Himalaya. The first African rally raid run was the Côte-Côte Rally, first held in December 1976. While the sport is most known for the Dakar Rally, a number of international and national series are also run. Internationally the FIA World Cup for Cross-Country Rallies and FIA World Cup for Cross-Country Bajas is held for cars, buggies, SSVs, & trucks while the FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship and FIM Bajas World Cup exists for motorbikes & quads. National cross-country rally championships are held in Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, and South Africa, among others. For amateurs the Budapest-Bamako has been considered the world's largest amateur rally raid spanning two continents and 9,000 km.Race Dezert http://www.race- dezert.com/home/the-trans-saharan-budapest-bamako-rally-49536.html Navigation Navigation is primarily accomplished using a paper roadbook in conjunction with a digital odometer to measure distance. The use of GPS or GPS-enabled devices, in contrast with desert racing, is not allowed. Competitors have no knowledge of the course until they receive the roadbook and any sort of pre-running is prohibited; which highlights the adventure aspect of rally raid. This is in stark contrast to rallying and desert racing where pre-running or reconnaissance is required or recommended for optimal performance on the course. The roadbook that is used is not as precise as the pacenotes used in stage rally, making navigation just as important as the driving. Bike and quad riders also have to navigate on their own while riding their vehicle; making concentration key during a rally raid event. Vehicles and classes The three major competitive groups in rally raid are the motorcycle (moto) class, including quads; the car class, ranging from 4x4 desert-racing prototypes to buggies and SxS vehicles; and the T4 & T5 truck class. Some events likes the ASO-sanctioned Dakar Rally separate the quads and SxSs into their own classes while the FIA and FIM-sanctioned events keep them as sub-classes. = Moto class = The Moto class is divided between three groups. Group 1 is Marathon bikes, which are mildly modified production motorcycles, subdivided between engines of greater and less than . Group 2 is Super-Production bikes, which are more substantially modified than Marathon bikes, subdivided between engines of greater and less than 451 cc. Group 3 is reserved for quads, and is subdivided between engines of greater and less than 500 cc. Popular motorcycles include those made by KTM, Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki, and Husqvarna because many of their bikes have finished in top positions. BMW motorcycles and Triumph have also been successful in the Dakar. = Car class—T1, T2, T3 and Open = Bowler Wildcat rally-raid vehicle The car class is made up of vehicles weighing less than and subdivided into several categories. The T1 Group is made up of Improved Cross Country Vehicles, such as the Mitsubishi MRX09 Racing Lancer, Toyota Hilux overdrive, Mini X-raid buggy, and the T2 Group is made up of Cross Country Series Production vehicles such as Toyota Land Cruiser, Nissan Patrol and Mercedes- Benz GLE-Class. The Open class accepts weight-qualifying vehicles, such as SCORE International trucks, while the T3 category refers to Side by Side (UTV) vehicles made by Polaris, Kawasaki Yamaha, and Can-Am. Originally, European utility vehicles like the Renault 4, Land Rover, Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz G, Volkswagen Iltis and the Pinzgauer, as well the Japanese Toyota Land Cruiser, dominated the sport. Other prominent examples in the Car Class included the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero, the Volkswagen Race Touareg, the Bowler Wildcat 200 and the Nissan Navara. Recent race winners include the Peugeot 3008 DKR and the Mini All4 Racing. =Truck class—T4 and T5= Kamaz 4326 modified for Dakar Rally The Truck class, also known as \\"Camions\\" or \\"Lorries\\" is made up of vehicles weighing more than . They are divided into two groups, Group T4 and T5. The T4 Group is made up of trucks that actually participate in the competition, while the T5 Group is reserved for rally support trucks, which means they travel from bivouac to bivouac to support other competition vehicles. The T4 Group is further divided into two subgroups: the T4.1 class for production trucks, and the T4.2 class for modified trucks. T4 trucks may provide assistance during the special stages, but must be homologated vehicles. T5 trucks do not have to be homologated. The T4 Group has been composed of vehicles manufactured by Tatra, LIAZ, Volkswagen, Kamaz, Hino, UD Trucks, MAN, DAF, MAZ, ZiL, Mercedes-Benz Unimog, Renault Kerax, Scania, Iveco and GINAF. In the 1980s, a strong rivalry between DAF and Mercedes-Benz led to vehicles which had twin engines and more than 1000 hp (750 kW). Later, Tatra and Kamaz took the race up. After 2000, renewed competition started in the truck class between DAF, Tatra, Mercedes-Benz, Iveco and Kamaz.

She was a daughter of Gyula of Transylvania and was probably educated in the Eastern Orthodox faith while her son was a Roman Catholic. She was married to Géza, the son of Taksony, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, who succeeded his father before 972. Sarolt exerted a powerful influence on her husband which allowed her to also influence his government.\\"In these days, he [Saint Adalbert] sent [a letter] to the High Prince of the Magyars, or rather to his wife who had been holding the whole country in her power with a hand of a man, and who had been governing everything owned by her husband\\" (Bruno of Querfurt: Sancti Adalberti Pragensis episcopi et martyris vita altera).

The main purpose of the dam is for supply of potable water for the Scenic Rim region. The impounded reservoir is also called Wyaralong Dam. The dam was initiated by the Queensland Government in 2006 as a result of a prolonged drought which saw the catchment areas of South East Queensland's dams receive record low rain. Location and features The dam is located approximately north-west of . The dam wall itself is split between the localities of Wyaralong and Allenview, but the bulk of impounded water is within Wyaralong. The Wyaralong Dam was completed prior to the 2010–2011 Queensland floods. On January 11, during the flood period, the Mayors of both Logan City and Scenic Rim said they believed that Logan had been spared a great deal of flood damage because of the dam. The concrete dam structure is high and long. The dam wall is constructed from a medium cementitious mix roller compacted concrete, which is a zero-slump concrete that is placed in 300mm thick lifts and compacted with vibratory compactors. The foundation is a sub horizontal dipping blocky sandstone. The dam is built with a wide uncontrolled central primary spillway and an uncontrolled left bank secondary spillway which commences discharging at the 1:100 year flood level. The dam cross section is rather squat in order to provide sufficient resistance against potential sliding along foundation bedding planes. The dam wall holds back the reservoir when at full capacity. From a catchment area of that includes much of the western portion of the McPherson Range, the dam creates an unnamed reservoir with a surface area of . Teviot Brook and the surrounding land is a recognised Aboriginal Pathway with significant cultural heritage values. The dam is managed by SEQ Water as part of a water security project in the South East Queensland region, known as the South East Queensland Water Grid. The outlet is on the right bank and is capable of abstracting water from any level of the reservoir by the use of baulks. The outlet includes an innovative and operationally complex bidirectional fish lift, which uses a single hopper to transport fish in both upstream and downstream directions. =Conception= The site was identified in a 1990 study, Water Supply Sources in South-East Queensland, as a future source of water supply for the South East Queensland region. In this report, the site of Wyaralong Dam was ranked 13th out of 15 studied possible dam locations in the region. A location on the Albert River at Glendower, also near Beaudesert, was the preferred location and the government subsequently bought back all the land required for the Glendower Dam. A new dam was not expected to be required until 2060 or later and Glendower Dam remained the preferred dam site, the land already fully government owned. Properties previously acquired by the government are progressively being sold to private buyers (2018). In October 2005, in advance of the state election, the Queensland government announced Wyaralong Dam as the new preferred option, even after recent studies into possible dam locations found a location upstream on the Logan River to be a more reliable option. After a series of studies, a Senate Inquiry and much contested information, Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett granted approval for the dam in November 2008. The dam is a storage and regulation facility. It does not discharge directly into the piped reticulation network, but rather discharges back into the natural drainage network of creeks and brooks. Water released from the dam flows downstream along Teviot Brook to Cedar Grove Weir, where it is diverted for treatment and use in the piped network. =Construction= Picnic area and boat ramp The construction was tendered under an alliance contract. In this type of contract risks and rewards are shared by all the proponents including designers constructors and the owner. Queensland Dam Consortium won the tender for the dam's construction, and the Alliance was formed from their members which included Macmahon Construction as the lead contractor, Hydro Tasmania, Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, Paul Rizzo and Associates (USA), ASI Contractors (USA) and Queensland Water Infrastructure the special purpose vehicle created by the Queensland Government owner to deliver the project. The Alliance contract for dam construction was for a little over 100 million. However it was widely reported that the building costs for the dam would total 333 million. The latter figure includes the cost of the Bromelton Offpeak Storage Project, Cedar Grove Weir and the reconstruction of a length of the Boonah to Beaudesert Road. Work on access roads began in early 2009 and construction of the dam wall began in early 2010. The diversion channel was plugged on 17 December 2010, allowing the dam to begin to fill. The dam site was opened to the public on 3 June 2011. The of new road between Boonah and Beaudesert were constructed under a separate contract by Fulton Hogan. The dam cost 380 million to construct, including purchasing farmland flooded by the dam reservoir. =Treatment= By late 2012 the dam still had not been connected to the SEQ Water Grid because it contains water so mineralised it is cheaper to produce desalinated water than to treat it. The Wyaralong water treatment plant is expected to cost 235 million to construct. Funding for the plant is planned for the 2014/15 financial year. January 2011 floods As a result of rainfall during the 2010–2011 Queensland floods the dam filled to 100% capacity, just 25 days after the wall was plugged to hold water, but before its completion. By 10 January during the flood period, the dam held , 80.7 per cent of its capacity. Parts of the dam were still under construction, but its wall was plugged to hold water on 17 December 2010. On 11 January the dam filled and began to overtop at 9:27am, Following the overtopping, in the first 24 hours over of water flowed over the primary spillway and entered the Logan River at Cedar Grove.

In normal conditions the lake surface area covers 230 hectares to an average depth of 2.5 metres. It is the terminus for water flowing from the Richardson River via Souths Creek and three smaller reservoirs to its southwest.  History  The lake was constructed in 1961 as an irrigation reservoir for dairying and for cereal crops. Water was diverted from the Richardson River during high-flow periods to create a reservoir holding an average of 1,130 ML and a maximum of 2,250 ML. More recently, the lake has been used for waterskiing and other recreational and tourist activities based in the nearby town of Donald and St. Arnaud.  Fauna  The lake is home to communities of Murray cod, golden perch and redfin perch, though fish habitat can be affected by drought conditions.  Flora  Native flora include species common to grassy wetlands. The shoreline is dominated by River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) associated with Canegrass (Eragrostis infecunda) Tangled Lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta) and spiny sedge (Cyperus gymnocaulus). The southern and southwestern shore is also home to stands of Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) Three threatened species are present: the Pale Spike sedge (Eleocharis pallens), Chariot Wheels (Maireana cheeli) and Turnip Copperbur (Sclerolaena napiformis). Upstream land clearing in the 1960s has increased salinity levels in the lake, but a 2006 water quality study indicated sufficient fresh water to maintain existing vegetation.

She is known for her work on the genetic and neural circuit mechanisms of behavior using C. elegans, particularly the mechanisms of olfaction in the worm. She has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and had been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at UCSF and then Rockefeller University from 1995 to 2016. It was announced on September 21, 2016 that she had been named the incoming president of science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, effective October 1, 2016. In 2012 she was awarded the $1 million Kavli Prize, and in 2013 the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. Early Life and Education Bargmann was born in Virginia and grew up in Athens, Georgia. Her parents are European immigrants. She is one of four sisters, and the daughter of Rolf Bargmann, a statistician and computer scientist at the University of Georgia.Crevar. She grew up playing the piano and was exposed to literature and education from a very young age. She described her family as “frighteningly well educated”. She was inspired to study science because her older sister attended medical school. She also says that growing up in the space era fostered her love for science. She completed undergraduate studies at the University of Georgia in 1981, with a degree in biochemistry. While at UGA she grew her lab experience by working in Wyatt Anderson's biology lab and then in Sidney Kushner's genetics lab. She completed graduate school from MIT with a Ph.D in the department of Biology in 1987 in the lab of Robert Weinberg. She examined the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis, and helped identify the role of Ras in bladder cancer. She wrote her thesis on neu, a non-Ras oncogene. Although the relevance of her research was doubted at the time, it later led to significant treatments in breast cancer.  Career and Research  Bargmann completed a postdoc with H. Robert Horvitz at MIT, working on molecular biology mechanisms of neuroscience. She began working on chemosensory behavior in C. elegans, and achieved several breakthroughs, demonstrating, among other things, that nematodes have a sense of smell. Bargmann accepted a faculty position at UCSF in the department of Anatomy in 1995. She was ultimately promoted from assistance professor to professor in 1998, and served as vice chair of the department from 1999–2000. At UCSF, she started her own lab with collaborator Marc Tessier-Lavigne. She continued her studies of worm behavior and neural control, focusing on olfaction at the molecular level. She looked for genes similar to those found by Richard Axel and Linda Buck to be the basis of smell and taste, and found those genes in the recently sequenced genome of C elegans. Her work led to discoveries of the mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, such as feeding behaviors. The work has continued to lead to a deeper understanding of the brain, sensory abilities, and neuronal development. Bargmann also identified SYG-1, a \\"matchmaker\\" molecule—a molecule that directs neurons to form connections with each other during development.Rockefeller, Jan. 5, 2004. In 2004, Bargmann moved to Rockefeller University. She says that the reason for the move is that she wanted more flexibility to focus on research. She served as an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute until 2016 before she took the President of CZI. Bargmann's lab uses a relatively simple organism, the nematode C. elegans, and its extremely sensitive sense of smell to study how genes regulate neuronal development, function, and behavior. Her work has been recognized with numerous awards including election to the National Academy of Sciences. Bargmann was the co-chair of the BRAIN initiative and is the Head of Science for the Chan Zuckerberg initiative. She won the Breakthrough prize in Life Sciences in 2013. Bargmann is married to fellow olfactory scientist Richard Axel, a Nobel laureate. Previously, she had been married to Michael J. Finney, who also completed graduate studies at MIT and is now a Director at Sage Science, Inc.

It is based on the novel Le Colonel Chabert by Honoré de Balzac. Another film adaptation of the novel starring Raimu had been released 50 years earlier, during the German occupation of France.  Synopsis  In Paris, in February 1817, three years after the fall of the Empire, the lawyer Derville receives a visit from a shabbily dressed man. He claims to be Colonel Chabert, believed dead at the Battle of Eylau in 1807. He had contributed to the victory by leading a famous cavalry charge against the Russians. The man tells how, waking in a mass grave surrounded by corpses, he survived his wounds. He has returned ten years later and wishes to claim his title, to assert his rights and to live again with his wife, who has greatly increased the fortune she inherited from him. She, during his absence, has married Count Ferraud and had children. She refuses to recognise her first husband. Derville agrees to help the colonel by proposing a settlement in which she will make a lage settlement on Chabert if he agrees to divorce her and give up his claims. She refuses the proposed terms and tries to manipulate her ex-husband, asking him to declare his claim is fraudulent. Chabert, disgusted by her deceitfulness and the idea of him renouncing his name, abandons his claim. Colonel Chabert finishes his life penniless and in an asylum, reminiscing on his last battle.

As a founding member of Positive Black Soul (PBS) with Duggy Tee, Awadi toured around the world contributing to the international popularity of Hip Hop Galsen. Awadi works as a solo artist, accompanied by his crew PBS Radikal. He participates in the Senegalese music industry through his label, recording studio, and rehearsal space, Studio Sankara. Awadi offers a conscious and revolutionary style of music strengthened by articulated and rooted messages. His motivation and inspiration is grounded in the Burkinabé revolutionary Thomas Sankara's phrase: \\"Let's dare to invent our future!\\" Biography Didier Awadi (Photo by Seneweb).Born on August 11, 1969 in Dakar, Senegal, Awadi is of Beninese and Cape Verdean descent. In 1984, while hip hop was slowly emerging on the Dakar scene, Awadi created the group Syndikat. In 1989, he formed Positive Black Soul with fellow hip hop musician Duggy Tee with the desire of promoting a positive image of Africa. In 1992, PBS was chosen by the French rapper with Senegalese origins, MC Solaar, to be the first part of his show touring throughout France. With a growing popularity, they recorded in 1994 their first track \\"Boul Faale,\\" (\\"Don't worry\\") in which they denounced the corruption of the local political system. This track became part of their first album, \\"Salaam\\" released in 1995 after a European tour and signed under the label, Island Records. Over the next fourteen years, PBS had multiple international collaborations (KRS-One, Mc Solaar, Princess Erika, K-Mel, Kimani Marley, etc.) and toured worldwide while releasing K7 and CD in Senegal and internationally. Throughout his career, as member of PBS and later as a solo artist, Awadi articulated a militant and critical discourse in favour of a brighter pan-African future. In 2001, the two members of PBS decided to start a solo careers. A year later, Awadi released his first solo album, “Kaddu Gor” (\\"Word of Honour\\") which received the Radio France Internationale (RFI) World Music Award in 2003. After announcing the formation of his new crew, PBS-Radikal with Baay Sooley, Carlou D, and Noumounda Cissoko, Awadi signed with Sony Music. In 2005, he released his second solo album, “Un Autre Monde est Possible” (“Another World is Possible”) in which he called for the emergence of a better society based on equity, fairness, justice, and freedom. In 2006, he released “Sunugaal”, a plea for the development of Senegal and against illegal immigration. In October 2007, Awadi presented his upcoming project, “Presidents of Africa” on the Bataclan (theatre) stage in Paris, with artists from all over the continent. This fourth album was released in April 2010. In 1998, Awadi began contributing to Dakar's musical industry with the creation of his first home studio, \\"Taf-Taf Production\\" (\\"quickly\\" in Wolof - but \\"well-done\\" as Awadi stresses) and the first rental of his PA system. In 2001, he produced a one- hour TV show mirroring the local hip hop culture, \\"Senerap\\". In 2003, he created a festival dedicated to the hip hop culture, \\"Senerap International\\". That same year, \\"Taf-Taf Production\\" became \\"Studio Sankara\\", a more formal and professional music production structure actively producing advertising spots. In 2009, as a joint initiative with music professionals and hip hop artists, Awadi organized the first edition of \\"72H Hip Hop\\", a three-day event celebrating Hip Hop Galsen through workshops, conferences, performances, and exhibitions.

He studied medicine in Lyon, and later worked in the hospitals of Hôtel Dieu, Croix-Rousse and Charité in Lyon. In addition to his work in medicine, he was an accomplished sculptor. Destot was a pioneer in the field of radiology.

He made thousands of radiographies, many of which were of patients supplied by surgeon Louis Léopold Ollier (1830–1900). In 1913, due to severe radiation damage to his hands, he was forced to relinquish his position as radiologist.

The series starred Malcolm Stoddard as James Campbell, a Scottish doctor living in 1830s Upper Canada with his three children, Neil (John Wildman), Emma (Amber-Lea Weston) and John (Eric Richards). Premise Dr. James Campbell tries to serve his patients in the face of local opposition from the Laird, and after several discouraging political events, as well as some unfortunate events regarding his practice, he desires a chance to start over. His sons, Neil and John, dissatisfied with their current, mundane lives, decide to emigrate from Scotland to Canada on hearing of the opportunity to own land in Canada and persuade him to make the move. Emma, James' daughter, is equally dissatisfied and likes the idea as well. The series is set in the vicinity of Cambridge, Upper Canada (now Ontario) in the 1830s. This is known because of the clothing, weaponry, and the constant references to the past war against \\"the Yankees\\" (War of 1812).

Barnesville is an unincorporated community in Ryan. Township, Schuylkill County . Originally built to support nearby rust belt industries, the hamlet is between the center and eastern thirds of the Southern Anthracite Coal Region. The community is part of a wide-ranging township and is situated atop a summit and drainage divide flanked by two long climbs that are traversed by local transport infrastructure, railways with an important switching junction within the village, and Pennsylvania Route 54, which collects towns like beads on a string along a particular combination of connected valleys in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. John Faust, in 1806, first settled in Barnesville, followed by Abram L. Boughner who located near the same place in 1815.Munsell, W.W., History of Schuylkill County, McNamara, NY (1881), p. 344 This village owes its origin to the building of the Little Schuylkill and Susquehanna - Catawissa Railroad, which was completed in 1854. Shortly thereafter, the first hotel was built by Jacob Faust and opened in 1854. The Little Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad, predecessor of the Catawissa Railroad, connected to the branch of the Little Schuylkill Railroad. This drove the development and growth of the village.Munsell, 1881, p. 344 Lakeside ParkBarnesville is quite unique in that it was the home to two swimming lake/amusement parks. In 1880, Lakeside Park opened with two dams and a picnic ground. With easy access by train it became a entertainment center with a large hotel on the grounds, bathing houses bordering the lake, and cottages on the water. A roller-coaster was erected on the site in 1923 and other amusement rides were added. Finally a large ballroom was constructed. In 1916, competition came in the form of a new park a mile away—Lakewood. That park, too, incorporated swimming, rides, a playhouse and, a Crystal Ballroom, opened in 1925, one year after Lakeside's. These ballrooms became Big Band-era entertainment meccas. Eventually, Lakeside became a venue from 1964 to 1970 for popular dances hosted by The Jordan Brothers. Lakewood (which also hosted the Jordan Brothers dances for one year in 1964) later hosted The Bavarian Summer Festival beginning in 1969 which became one of the biggest draws in the coal region for 15 years. Lakeside Ballroom today is still used for entertainment. The (historical designated) building is roughly 28,000 SF with a 10,000 SF maple wooden dance floor that can host several thousand people. The village located in the northeastern part of the state amidst gentle summit terrain after the long east–west climb up the Nesquehoning Creek valley, Barnesville was founded primarily as a railroad town with a watering depot for the Nesquehoning Railroad (and later the Nesquehoning and Mahanoy Railroad and Lehigh & Susquehanna Railroad) after its climb via the Pine Creek valley from Hometown, Nesquehoning, and Tamaqua to the east. These communities lie within the Southeastern Anthracite Coal Region. Residents who live in Rush Township may attend either Tamaqua Area School District or Mahanoy Area School District, while Ryan Township residents attend Mahanoy Area School District. Barnesville includes Hosensock, Grier City, and Locust Valley.

Tarchaneiotes's segment of the army was detached to take nearby Khliat before the main battle took place. It is not clear what happened then, though in any case Khliat was not taken by the Byzantines. Tarchaneiotes's lack of participation in the campaign, whether due to treachery, dissatisfaction, or a defeat in battle, seriously undermined Romanos IV's (r. 1068 – 1071) ability to fight at Manzikert. Even though his detachment was either defeated (according to Seljuk sources) or eliminated by causes unknown (Byzantine sources do not mention it at all), Tarchaneiotes survived.

History After World War I, it became apparent to military planners that air power, especially naval air power, constituted a serious threat to the safety of the Panama Canal. The one existing airfield (France Field) was too small, had a poor landing surface, offered no room for expansion, and provided little defense for the Pacific entrance to the canal. Construction for an air base at Albrook Field was authorized by Congress in 1928, and $1.9 million was appropriated. Actual construction began in 1930 and most works were completed in 1932. Albrook Army Airfield was commissioned in April 1932 as an active air field. The original construction program at Albrook left out several buildings necessary for efficient flight operations, including a headquarters building. As money could be secured throughout the 1930s, seven buildings were added to the base. In addition, the runways were unsuitable for all-weather flying and had to be improved. By the mid-1930s, advances in naval aviation (primarily aircraft carriers) and increasingly long-range bombers had again made plain the inadequacies of air defense of the canal. Plans to significantly expand Air Corps strength had been around since 1934, essentially proposing a system of outlying bases supported by pursuit and bombardment aircraft. It was 1939, however, before these plans began to be realized. Congressional authorization and $50 million in funding were forthcoming that year for improving the canal defenses. Since a large part of the expansion program was a vast increase in manpower, much of the new construction involved housing at existing bases. In addition, a new airfield (Howard Field) was authorized for the west bank of the Pacific entrance to the canal. The majority of the expansion program construction was completed by early 1942. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the number of troops in Panama was sharply increased. The newly established Caribbean Defense Command carried out its mission of canal defense through a widespread net of naval and air reconnaissance, with the greatest threat coming from German U-boats. By April 1943, the threat to the canal was diminishing, defense status was downgraded, and a reduction in troop strength began. Albrook Field became Albrook Air Force Base on March 26, 1948, by the Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10. AAFES operated an \\"Albrook Mall\\" in various buildings, that was one of the primary shopping areas available to US troops stationed there (not just Air Force). In 1966, elements of the USAF's 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing flew Lockheed U-2 aircraft from the base to perform atmospheric sampling as the French detonated a nuclear device in the South Pacific. In 1975 the facility was downgraded to Albrook Air Force Station when the control tower was closed and Air Force aircraft and units moved to Howard Air Force Base. The airstrip and adjacent hangars and buildings (Albrook Army Airfield) was transferred to the government of Panama on October 1, 1979, along with the adjacent the PAD (Panama Air Depot) Area. The base saw action again during the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, including an extended firefight at its front gate. The station was turned over to the Government of Panama on 30 September 1997 as a result of the Torrijos- Carter Treaties and was subsequently vacated by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Famous for his love songs in his own day, his contemporaries gave him the nickname dieu d'amor (god of love). He wrote two ensenhamens (didactic poems) and two saluts d'amor (love letters) that survive. The uncertainty about his origins stems from the fact that his poems refer extensively to Catalan people and places, but a singer of the same name is found signing a Gascon document of 1253. Whether the signatory of 1253 and the troubadour are one and the same is left open to doubt, but it is possible that Amanieu was a Catalan who was either born in or lived in Gascony, which was not uncommon at the time. His earliest datable work is also his shortest, the salut \\"A vos, que ieu am deszamatz\\", which was written 24 August 1278. His first ensenhamen was the \\"Ensenhamen del scudier\\" about a squire (scudier) who observes his noble master in love, in leisure, and preparing for war and can thus describe the ideal nobleman. It was addressed al comte gent apres En B. d'Astarac (to Bernard IV of Astarac) and must therefore have been written before the count's death in 1291. Also in that period was written his second and longer salut, which refers to James the Just as \\"reys ... de cecilias\\", which puts it between 1285, when James inherited Sicily, and 1291, when he inherited Aragon. Amanieu's second didactic work, the \\"Ensenhamen de la donsela\\" can be dated between 1291 and 1295 by a reference to James as King of Aragon and to the ongoing War of the Sicilian Vespers. It is addressed to an unnamed donsela (young woman) and is designed to teach her how to behave in courtly society and how to be respected. Amanieu's poetry is definitely influenced by Peire Vidal and also possibly by Arnaut de Maruelh. The later troubadour Peire Lunel de Montech wrote, in a letter of 1320, \\"I have heard it said that you [unknown] have [the book, i.e. the ensenhamens] of Sir Amanieu, who is called the god of love, where he teaches about the young woman and the squire.\\" Sources *Riquer, Martín de.

He was a major figure in Jugendstil, the German form of Art Nouveau, and a founder of architecture in the style. A founder member of both the Vereinigte Werkstätte für Kunst im Handwerk (United Workshops for Art in Handcrafts) and the Deutscher Werkbund and the director of art and design institutions in Munich and Cologne, he prized craftsmanship but also pioneered machine production of artistically designed objects. Life and career Riemerschmid was born in Munich, the sixth of nine children of Eduard Riemerschmid, who headed the Munich distillery founded by his father Anton Riemerschmid,Winfried Nerdinger, Richard Riemerschmid, vom Jugendstil zum Werkbund: Werke und Dokumente.

After completing his Abitur at the Wilhelmsgymnasium in 1886 and military service in the army, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich under Gabriel Hackl and Ludwig von Löfftz from 1888 to 1890 and then worked as an independent artist and architect. He began as an Impressionist and Symbolist painter.Lesley Jackson, Twentieth Century Pattern Design: Textile and Wallpaper Pioneers, London: Beazley, 2002, , p. 30.Antonia Gruhn-Zimmermann, \\"Riemerschmid, Richard\\", Neue Deutsche Biographie He produced advertising of various kinds on commission, including series of pictures for albums for the Stollwerck chocolate company of Cologne, one called \\"The Seasons\\" (Jahreszeiten) for Album No. 4 of 1899.

He played an important role in the 1922 German Handcrafts Exhibition in Munich. He published books on art education. Riemerschmid paved the way for the modern artistic handcrafts movement. Influenced by the English Arts and Crafts movement,The name and concept of the Vereinigte Werkstätten both derived from William Morris; Nerdinger, p. 16 he created furniture, carpets, fabric and wallpaper designs and glass and porcelain pieces. In all of these his guiding principles were \\"objective clarity and purpose, solid craftsmanship and the use of simple, inexpensive materials\\".Johannes Just, Meissen Porcelain of the Art Nouveau Period, London: Orbis, 1985, , p. 128.Kathryn B Hiesinger, Art Nouveau in Munich: Masters of Jugendstil from the Stadtmuseum, Munich, and other public and private collections, Münchner Stadtmuseum, Munich: Prestel/Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1988, , p. 110: \\"Riemerschmid's endeavor to harmonize form and function results in a simplicity that was much acclaimed by his contemporaries.\\" He created several interior designs, including for the Munich Kammerspiele (1900/01). With Joseph Maria Olbrich and his friend and colleague Bruno Paul, he designed the 30 luxury cabins of the fast ocean liner SS Kronprinzessin Cecilie, launched in 1906, at the time one of the most ambitious and successful German passenger vessels,Nerdinger, p. 214.According to Anne Wealleans, Designing Liners: A History of Interior Design Afloat, Abingdon, Oxfordshire/New York: Routledge, 2006, repr. 2008, , p. 58, Runge and Scotland of Bremen, plus Riemerschmid, Olbrich and Paul designed 40 of the first class cabins. and he, Paul, and Johann Poppe, house designer for the North German Lloyd Line, were to have co- designed the interiors of the never finished SS Columbus of 1914.\\"The Sumptuousness of Modern Travel\\", Current Opinion 56 (1914) pp. 478-84, p. 480. The furniture in his 1899 show interiors was praised for its style, for varying the repetitive verticals by adding a diagonal note to the framing of a glass-fronted cabinet and having chairs taper upwards from a broad base, and above all for remaining true to simplicity.A.L. Plehn, \\"Die Zimmerausstattung auf den Ausstellungen in Berlin, München und Dresden im Sommer 1899\\", Kunstgewerbeblatt 11 (1900) pp. 19-33, p. 30 ; picture of a mahogany corner seat by Riemerschmid p. 16. He began designing furniture because he could not find what he wanted for his flat after his marriage.Like William Morris: Nerdinger, p. 13. In 1903-04 he designed a dinner and coffee service for Meissen porcelain, part of their attempt to incorporate art nouveau designs; it was well received by the critics but did not sell well,Robert E.

Staircase in Fischel villa Workers' houses in Walddorfstraße, Hagen Riemerschmid designed the site plan, the factory and some of the housing for Hellerau (now part of Dresden), which was the first garden city of the English type to be built in Germany.John V. Maciuika, Before the Bauhaus: Architecture, Politics, and the German State, 1890-1920, Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University, 2005, , p. 233. As an architect, he is known particularly for his houses: his own house in Munich, the Villa Fischel in Kiel, the Fieser villa in Baden-Baden, and the Frank villa in Göttingen and country house in Witzenhausen, and for the uncompleted \\"Walddorfstraße\\" workers' housing complex in Hagen, Westphalia, although his major contribution to Jugendstil architecture was his interior for the Munich Schauspielhaus (playhouse; later the Kammerspiele).Frank Russell, Art Nouveau Architecture, New York: Rizzoli, 1979, p. 180. At the United Workshops in Hellerau, Riemerschmid developed a programme of machine production of art furniture. For example, a chair in his \\"music room\\" exhibit at the German Art Exhibition in Dresden in 1899 was so popular, the Workshops immediately placed it in production, it was also being manufactured and sold by Liberty's the next year, and it was widely copied.Otakar Máčel, Sander Woertman and Charlotte van Wijk, Chairs: Catalogue of the Delft Faculty of Architecture Collection, Rotterdam: 010, 2008, , p. 202. He subsequently expanded this to the production of house kits. One such house, ordered in 1922 at an exhibition and erected in 1923 in Rodenkirchen near Cologne from 4,000 parts, mostly wood but including tiles and heating stoves, was disassembled and stored in Leverkusen in 1978. In 1984 the State of North Rhine-Westphalia declared it a landmark, and research revealed that it was the only example of the model ever built. A grandchild of the original purchaser had the pieces moved in 2004 to Simbach am Inn, Bavaria and reassembled there at considerable cost, assisted by the Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz (German Foundation for Landmark Protection).Carola Nathan, Zerlegt und auf die Reise geschickt: Riemerschmids Fertighaus in Simbach, Monumente Online, April 2008 In 1895, Riemerschmid married the actress Ida Hofmann. They had four children. In 1910, his sister Frieda became the second wife of Karl Schmidt-Hellerau, the founder of the United Workshops.Klaus-Peter Arnold, \\"Schmidt (seit 1938 Ehrenname Schmidt- Hellerau), Karl\\", Neue Deutsche Biographie After the Nazi regime came to power in 1933, Riemerschmid was forced out of the Werkbund,1933/34: 3.

Named after noted free soloist John Bachar, Bachar ladders typically consist of PVC rungs joined by webbing or cord to create an unstable structure similar to the ratlines of a sailing ship. However, unlike ascending ratlines leaning inward using one's legs for upward progress and arms for steadying, the Bachar Ladder is typically hung at an overhanging angle of 20-45° and climbed from below using only the arms. Whereas the campus board focuses more on powerful, sometimes far reaching movements, the Bachar ladder differs in that it swings slightly when it is being climbed, requiring the climber to use more core tension to maintain stability. For athletes who have practiced pulling movements using only fixed or stable points, the Bachar ladder can improve strength and efficiency of climbing/pulling movements. It produces greater engagement of core musculature, benefiting shoulder stability, improving motor unit recruitment when pulling and proprioception. It could present an increased risk of elbow and shoulder joint tendon/ligament injury for users who are inexperienced or lack proper pulling mechanics such as poor shoulder range of motion.

It was the 13th Alamo Bowl. The Nebraska Cornhuskers, second-place finishers in the Big 12 Conference's North Division, defeated the Michigan Wolverines, third-placed finishers in the Big Ten Conference. This matchup was notable in that it featured the two schools that shared the 1997 national championship. At the time, Michigan and Nebraska were two of only five schools in NCAA Division I history with 800 or more victories. Game summary Nebraska started the scoring with a 52-yard touchdown pass from Zac Taylor to wide receiver Terrence Nunn. Michigan tied it at 7–7 on a 13-yard pass from Chad Henne to tight end Tyler Ecker. In the second quarter, Henne hooked up with Mike Massey for a 16-yard touchdown pass, giving Michigan a 14–7 lead. Taylor found wide receiver Nate Swift for a 14-yard touchdown pass late in the second quarter, knotting the score at 14–14 going into the half. In the third quarter, kicker Jordan Congdon gave Nebraska a 17–14 lead with a 20-yard field goal. Henne later found wide receiver Mario Manningham for a 21-yard touchdown and Michigan reclaimed the lead, 21–17. Henne led off the scoring in the fourth quarter with a rushing touchdown, extending Michigan's lead to 28–17. Running back Cory Ross then scored on a 31-yard touchdown scamper for Nebraska. Taylor found Todd Peterson for the ensuing two-point conversion, narrowing Michigan's lead to 28–25. With 4:29 left in the game, Taylor and Nunn hooked up again for a 13-yard go-ahead touchdown to give Nebraska a 32–28 lead. =Final Play= Michigan's last- ditch attempt to win the game came on a seven-lateral scramble somewhat reminiscent of the famous Cal-Stanford band play. Henne completed a pass across the middle of the field to Jason Avant, who caught the ball at midfield and immediately lateraled to Steve Breaston. Breaston threw the ball backwards to Mike Hart, who lateraled back to Avant. Avant then threw the ball across the entire width of the field, where it was caught by Manningham as he was being tackled. Manningham attempted another backward pass, which hit the ground and bounced two or three times off the hands of two Nebraska defenders, before being picked up by another Michigan player, who lateraled to Ecker. Because the ball had hit the ground, several members of both teams and the media, believing the play was dead, rushed onto the field while Ecker ran downfield. Nebraska players also gave their coach the Gatorade dunk before the play was over, reminiscent of the Bluegrass Miracle. Ecker dodged several players and coaches and returned the ball approximately 60 yards to the Nebraska 16-yard line, at which point Cornhusker cornerback Zackary Bowman knocked him out of bounds after time had expired ending the game. No flags were thrown on the play despite the entrance of Nebraska coaches onto the field. =Scoring summary=First quarter * Nebraska - Terrence Nunn, 52-yard pass from Zac Taylor (Jordan Condon kick) * Michigan - Tyler Ecker, 13-yard pass from Chad Henne (Garrett Rivas kick) Second quarter * Michigan - Mike Massey, 16-yard pass from Chad Henne (Garrett Rivas kick) * Nebraska - Nate Swift, 14-yard pass from Zac Taylor (Jordan Condon kick) Third quarter * Nebraska - Jordan Condon, 20-yard field goal * Michigan - Mario Manningham, 21-yard pass from Chad Henne (Garrett Rivas kick) Fourth quarter * Michigan - Chad Henne, 7-yard run (Garrett Rivas kick) * Nebraska - Cory Ross, 31-yard run (Todd Peterson pass from Zac Taylor) * Nebraska - Terrence Nunn, 13-yard pass from Zac Taylor (Jordan Condon kick) ReferencesExternal links * ESPN game summary * Review of game by USA Today * Summary at Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan Athletics History Alamo Bowl Category:Alamo Bowl Category:Michigan Wolverines football bowl games Category:Nebraska Cornhuskers football bowl games ","title":"2005 Alamo Bowl"},{"id":"15112007","text":"Gagnier is a surname shared by several notable people: * Ed Gagnier (1882–1946), French-American baseball player * Ed Gagnier (born 1936), American gymnast and coach * Holly Gagnier (born 1962), American actress * Laurent Gagnier (born 1979), French footballer ","title":"Gagnier"},{"id":"15112016","text":"Gmina Bartoszyce is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Bartoszyce County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland, on the border with Russia.

California background Theodore Winters was one of the foremost horsemen who founded Thoroughbred racing and breeding in California. Winters had gone west because of the California Gold Rush. Once there, he made his money as a businessman and by dealing in gold mining stock. Besides owning a huge spread near the present town of Winters in Yolo County, California, called Rancho del Arroyo, he owned another California farm on the banks of the Sacramento River near Sacramento called Rancho del Rio. On Rancho del Rio, he kept his best stallion, Norfolk, by the great stallion Lexington. Meanwhile, in the 1870s, the founder of California's first sporting paper, the \\"Breeder and Sportsman\\" Joseph Cairn Simpson, had also come west, bringing a few horses. The best one was his homebred Illinois mare called Marian. To help finance his newspaper venture, Simpson sold Marian to \\"Black T\\" Winters. (Simpson eventually organized the Pacific Coast Blood Horse Association as well as becoming a founding member of the National Trotting Association.) For years, Winters bred Norfolk to Marian, and almost every one of their ten foals proved exceptional, two among them in particular: Emperor of Norfolk and El Rio Rey. When Norfolk grew too old, Winters put Marian to a California-bred horse he owned called Joe Hooker, also a tail-line descendant of Lexington. Joe Hooker had, as well, the distinction of being a half-brother to the racing mare Mollie McCarty. Marian and Joe Hooker Joe Hooker had had a brief and difficult racing career, but many turfmen believed him the fastest race horse California had ever seen. When Winters bought him, already owning Norfolk, he gave him little thought. He bred him to a few Rancho del Arroyo mares, and then sent him on to this third ranch, the Rancho del Sierra in Washoe Valley, Nevada, to run in a pasture with a few lesser mares for company. When the Rancho del Arroyo mares started dropping Joe Hooker foals who were winners, Winters brought Joe Hooker back to the main breeding barn near Sacramento. The first mare he bred him to was his best mare, Marian. The result of the 1888 match between Marian and Joe Hooker was Yo Tambien. Yo Tambien (Spanish for Me Too) was, like her father, a bright chestnut. Joe Hooker was a showy horse, and passed that showiness on to his daughter who turned out to be his best offspring. Yo Tambien won the most and raced the longest. In the Gay Nineties, she was called \\"Queen of the Turf.\\" Racing days Winters began racing Yo Tambien at the San Francisco Bay District Course as a two-year-old. She easily won her first race and then took the Youthful Stakes. Winters immediately sent her east to compete against the best fillies of her day. By the end of her first season, she'd started 14 times and won eight races, four in succession. Her losses were said by Winters to be due to her high strung nature. Before she reached the starting line, she was often exhausted. Before her second season, \\"Black T\\" Winters decided to withdraw from the actual racing of his horses and to concentrate on breeding them. To this end, he shipped his juveniles, including Yo Tambien, to the Crescent City Jockey Club in Chicago to sell. Gambler and horseman Chris Smith bought them all. Yo Tambien alone cost him $17,000. For the rest of her career, she raced for Smith's Kendall Stables. At the age of three, Yo Tambien ran sixteen times and won fourteen times. In newspaper articles of the day, she was called \\"Queen of the Turf.\\" She made the greatest impact in the Garfield Park Derby, in which she carried 127 pounds and was the sole filly against the best colts in the west. One was that year's winner of the Kentucky Derby, Azra. In the Great Western Handicap, carrying much more weight than rivals, Yo Tambien clocked the mile and a half race at 2 minutes 33 and ¾ seconds. After the Great Western, Smith was offered $35,000 for her, at the time a huge sum. In her third season at four, Yo Tambien made 17 starts, winning 11 and placing in four. She came in third in the remaining two races. In her best race of 1893, she beat the very good mare Racine and went on an eight-race winning streak. In 1894, she won ten of 18 starts. At the age of six, Yo Tambien won only one of her nine starts, and the decision was made to retire her. Her earnings were the third highest for a mare in US history at the time. Only Miss Woodford and Firenze won more. Ending Yo Tambien was sent to the McGrathiana Stud in Kentucky to begin her career as a broodmare. She was successfully bred to the great Hanover (enjoying one of his best years at stud), but one day, pregnant and in turn- out in her paddock, she became so seriously impaled on a loose board she had to be destroyed. Yo Tambien died in 1896 at age seven.

Maria Moninckx (22 April 1673 (baptised) - 26 February 1757 (buried)) was a Dutch botanical artist and painter, best known for the colour plates she and her father, Jan Moninckx, created and which make up the nine-volume Moninckx Atlas. This was published in the period 1686-1709 and depicted 420 plants from the Hortus Medicus of Amsterdam. She was born in The Hague and died in Amsterdam. Hortus Medicus In 1682 Joan Huydecoper II and Jan Commelin took the initiative in establishing a new Hortus Medicus in Amsterdam. It differed from the herb garden at the Binnengasthuis insofar as it also grew ornamental plants and would function as a Hortus Botanicus. Huydecoper was mayor of Amsterdam and had great influence with the Dutch East India Company, while Commelin was a merchant in herbs and pharmaceuticals. Both men were well known as enthusiastic and knowledgeable gardeners. Because of their contacts in the business world and their practical horticultural experience, they received a constant stream of plants, seeds, bulbs and cuttings to be cultivated far from their original habitat. This led to the creation of one of the richest plant collections in Europe. Plants of commercial value, also potherbs, edible crop plants and medicinal plants, were propagated in the garden for planting elsewhere. An example of this was the coffee plant, which oddly, was not illustrated in the Moninckx Atlas, but became the backbone of the Brazilian coffee industry. In addition many ornamental plants, especially strange and exotic plants, were cultivated. These plants were grown for pure interest, curiosity value and often for further research. Moninckx Atlas Between 1686 and 1709, Huydecoper and Commelin commissioned 420 large parchment aquarels of plants growing in the Amsterdam garden. The garden did not have a herbarium, and a pictorial record in the form of paintings, would create something of permanent value. Four very accomplished artists were employed to tackle this extensive project. The lion's share of work was done by Jan Moninckx: 273 sheets bear his signature. Maria Moninckx, his daughter, produced 101 paintings. The other artists were Alida Withoos (13 aquarels) and Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff (daughter of Maria Sibylla Merian) with 2 sheets; 31 aquarels were unsigned. The heraldic arms of Huydecoper and Commelin, painted by Jan Moninckx, were used to decorate volume 1 of the Atlas. In 1749 there was an attempt to expand the collection. This 9th volume consisted of a mere five aquarels, one by Dorothea Storm-Kreps and four by Jan Matthias Cock. The illustrated plants in the first five volumes and part of the sixth, had their names printed in both Latin and Dutch. The Latin names in bold Roman type, and the Dutch names in elegant Gothic calligraphy. This monumental work is still of great taxonomic, historic, and artistic interest. The aquarels have served as the basis for engravings in the Horti Medici Amstelodamensis rariorum plantarum historia, part 1, by Jan Commelin, appearing in 1697 and part 2, by his cousin Caspar Commelin, in 1701. The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus based the taxonomy for his Species plantarum of 1753 on no fewer than 259 species from the Moninckx Atlas. A recent scanning of the complete work has made the plates and text available on the University of Amsterdam website. Moninckx family The Moninckx family had a long tradition of being painters and were researched in a book titled De Schildersfamilie Moninckx, published by Abraham Bredius in 1889. Well-known was Gijsbert Moninckx, a member of the Guild of St Lucas in The Hague in 1605. Bredius' book confuses Maria Moninckx with Machteld Moninckx, the widow of Paulus Dinant. Maria's father was Jan Moninckx, her collaborator on the Moninckx Atlas, and her mother was Ariaentje Pieters. On 18 April 1723 Maria signed a betrothal register in Amsterdam, avowing her intention to marry Martinus de la Ruel. Maria's age was given as 47 years and her place of residence as The Hague, while Martinus was 46 years old and from Amsterdam. Maria's signature in the betrothal register corresponds with her signature on the aquarels of the Moninckx Atlas. See also *List of florilegia and botanical codices References *Wijnands, D. O.

His work was heavily influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, of which he was a noted architectural historian. Life and career Brandon-Jones was born in Hendon into a family with a strong Unitarian tradition, and was christened by the Rev Charles Voysey (with whose grandson Brandon-Jones would later enter into an architectural partnership). Brandon-Jones' father was an art teacher, while his mother studied dress at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and wrote books on embroidery. The family moved to Harpenden and Brandon-Jones' father was engaged as an art teacher at Berkhamsted School, and where Brandon-Jones was enrolled in 1919. However, after contracting tuberculosis in 1921, he was sent to Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight, which most likely influenced his decision to become an architect. While at Bembridge he learned his skills in wood working, engraving and printing, as well as becoming passionate about building and sailing boats. At the age of 18, he was apprenticed to the architect, Oswald Milne (former assistant to Edwin Lutyens), and in 1929 attended the Architectural Association School of Architecture. However, he found the new Le Corbusier style of Modern Architecture unappealing, preferring to honour continuity with the past in his designs. Before adopting the Arts and Craft idiom he designed a small development of Moderne houses for Charles Wicksteed who had also created Wicksteed Park on the same plot of land. In 1933, he joined the partnership of Charles Cowles-Voysey as an assistant, later a partner. Voysey and Brandon- Jones won a competition for the design of Watford Town Hall, and later designed the town halls in Worthing and Bromley, as well as the Guildhall in Cambridge and the Hull Festival House. In 1937 he was appointed a lecturer in architecture at Liverpool University's School of Architecture \\"where he reinstated measured drawing and the study of the classical orders, the latter as a way of learning construction, weathering and colour.\\",Alan Powers, \\"Obituary: John Brandon-Jones\\", The Independent, 11 May 1999. Retrieved 6 October 2014. but with the start of World War II he joined the Navy as part of the Admiralty Works Department. Posted to Scapa Flow, Orkney and placed in charge of the engineers' drawing office, he designed a temporary cinema. While on Orkney he met (and later married in 1944), Helen, a cipher clerk from Glasgow.\\"Obituary: John Brandon-Jones.\\" The Guardian, 19 May 1999. It was also on Orkney that he encountered three rare houses on Hoy designed by William Lethaby, and his interest in and study of these led him to become one of the most respected authorities in arts and crafts domestic architecture. By pure chance, this interest was encouraged by the gift from his good friend, Dorothy Walker (the daughter of Emery Walker), of a bundle of original designs and sketches by Philip Webb. In 1955 Brandon-Jones purchased one of a pair of houses designed by Webb in Redington Road, Hampstead, in which house Brandon- Jones lived with his family until his death in 1999. His championship of Webb's reputation helped persuade the National Trust to take the Webb designed Standen into their collection. When the war ended, he taught at the Architectural Association but resigned when the director objected to him telling the students about Webb and Lethaby \\"because you will undermine their confidence in the Modern Movement.\\"Obituary: John Brandon-Jones. The Daily Telegraph, 20 May 1999. He rejoined Cowles-Voysey's office in 1949 as a full partner, continuing to design civic offices. In 1955 Cowles-Voysey retired and Brandon-Jones and the other partners inherited the firm. By this time, he was in partnership with Robert Ashton and John Broadbent. With them he designed the Civic Offices in Brentwood, and rebuilt the bomb-damaged Morley College in South London. In 1960, the Hampshire County Offices in Winchester, considered to be his masterpiece, were completed. His last large civic commission was for the Surrey County buildings in Staines. He was president of the Architectural Association School from 1957-8, and on the Royal Institute of British Architects board of architectural education. With his good friend, John Betjeman, he helped found the Victorian Society in 1958. He was a member of the William Morris Society, the Society of Antiquaries of London, the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and the Art Workers Guild, and sat on the Architects Registration Council. John Brandon-Jones died in London on 1 May 1999 after a brief illness. He was survived by his wife, four daughters (two of whom followed him into architecture) and a son.

Its common names include southern wax myrtle, southern bayberry, candleberry, bayberry tree, and tallow shrub. It sees uses both in the garden and for candlemaking, as well as a medicinal plant.  Taxonomy  This plant is one of several Myrica species that are sometimes split into the genus Morella, e.g. in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System. This species also has several synonyms aside from the Myrica/Morella split: Cerothamnus pumilus, C. ceriferus, Myrica cerifera var. pumila, and Myrica pusilla. Myrica cerifera is similar to M. pensylvanica and M. caroliniensis. These plants' scent or fruits can distinguish them. The generic name Myrica comes from a Greek word myrike, which refers to some fragrant plant (possibly tamarisk). The specific name means \\"wax-bearing\\". Description Myrica cerifera is a small tree or large shrub. It is adaptable to many habitats, growing naturally in wetlands, near rivers and streams, sand dunes, fields, hillsides, pine barrens, and in both coniferous and mixed-broadleaf forests. In nature, it ranges from Central America, northward into the southeastern and south-central United States. Wax Myrtle can be successfully cultivated as far north as the New York City area and southern Ohio Valley. It also grows in Bermuda and the Caribbean. In terms of succession, M. cerifera is often one of the first plants to colonize an area. The male and female flowers M. cerifera is an evergreen. The glandular leaves are long, have a leathery texture and serrated edges, and contain aromatic compounds. The plant is dioecious, with male and female flowers borne in catkins on separate plants. Male flowers have three or four stamens, and are surrounded by short bracts. The female flowers develop into fruit, which are globular and surrounded by a natural wax-like coating. The species flowers from late winter to spring, and bear fruit in late summer or fall. No endosperm is present on the seeds. M. cerifera can also reproduce clonally through runners. This species occurs in two forms, but there is no clear dividing line between them, many intermediate forms occurring. Specimens in drier and sandier areas are shrub-like, have rhizomes and smaller leaves. Those growing in damper situations with richer soil are more tree-like with bigger leaves. The fruit is a source of food for many bird species, including the northern bobwhite quail and the wild turkey. In winter, the seeds are important foods for the Carolina wren and species of tree sparrow. To a point, M. cerifera will also provide habitat for the northern bobwhite quail. Birds' digestive systems remove the wax from the fruit, a prerequisite for germination. This plant's roots possess root nodules, which harbor a symbiotic species of actinomycotal fungus, which fixes nitrogen at a faster rate than do the legumes. The above-ground growth of M. cerifera is often killed by wildfires unless the fire is very small or transient. In the latter situation, only the most recent primary growth may be incinerated. Because the leaves, stem, and branches contain flammable aromatic compounds, a specimen of M. cerifera is in fact a fire hazard. In contrast to the flammability of its top growth, M. cerifera's root system is fire-resistant. By 1991, no known fire had killed this plant's roots. However, this plant will not survive repeated destruction of its top growth indefinitely. Three consecutive years of burning may kill all plants affected. After less damaging fires, new shoots will regrow from below ground. This regrowth is most rapid in the first season after a fire. Uses=Ornamental= Myrica cerifera finds use in gardening and horticulture. It has been commonly grown in American hardiness zones of 11 to 7. M. pensylvanica substitutes for M. cerifera in areas colder than zone 6. Since the species is adaptable, it will tolerate many conditions, although it has a need for frequent pruning. It can handle abuse from bad pruning, however. The species has at least four cultivars. Those dubbed Fairfax, Jamaica Road, and Don's Dwarf differ from the \\"typical\\" specimen in habit and form. The latter two are also resistant to leaf spot. Var. pumila is a dwarf cultivar. =Herbalism= Bayberry root bark has a history of use in herbalism. The plant contains several organic compounds, including: triterpenes such as myricadiol, taraxerol, and taraxerone, as well as chemicals such as different flavonoids, tannins, resins, gums, and phenols. Myricadiol has a slight impact on levels of potassium and sodium, while a substance called myricitrin has antibiotic properties. The Choctaw boiled bayberry and used the result as a treatment for fevers. In 1722, it was reported that colonists in Louisiana drank a mixture of wax and hot water to treat severe dysentery. Bayberry was reported in an account from 1737 as being used to treat convulsions, colic, palsy, and seizures. Starting in the early 19th century, the herbalist Samuel Thomson recommended this plant for producing \\"heat\\" within the body and as a treatment for infectious diseases and diarrhea. That use of bayberry waned later in the 19th century, in favor of using it for a variety of ailments, including a topical use for bleeding gums. For twenty years starting in 1916, bayberry root bark was listed in the American National Formulary. Use of bayberry in herbalism has declined since its peak in popularity in the 19th century. The plant is still used today in the treatment of fever, diarrhea, and a few other ailments. The chemical myricitrin has anti-fever properties. In addition, that chemical, along with the tannins, has anti-diarrheal properties. Myricitrin works as an antibiotic, while the tannins have astringent properties. In general, either a decoction or a tincture is used. Infusions and a topical paste have also been used. Pregnant women should not use bayberry. In addition, tannin action relating to cancer is unclear, with studies indicating both pro and anti-cancer effects. bayberry, just like any other medicinal plant, should only be used under the supervision of a physician. =Candles= Southern bayberry's fruits are a traditional source of the wax for old-fashioned Christmas decorations called bayberry candles. The wax was extracted by boiling the berries, and skimming off the floating hydrocarbons. The fats were then boiled again and then strained. After that the liquid was usable in candle making, whether through dipping or molding. Southern bayberry is not the only plant usable for making bayberry candles, however. Its close relatives are also usable. Southern bayberry and its relatives have largely been supplanted in candlemaking by substitutes made from paraffin. The substitute candles have artificial colors and scents that create candles that look and smell similar to natural ones.

It is part of the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan. About the village Tain lies 15 km to the north of Mandawa town in the Jhunjhunu district, bounded by the districts of Sikar and Churu. It is a former estate of 12 villages founded in 1761 by Thakur Sahib Salem Singhji the grandson of Maharao Sardul Singh, a ruler of Jhunjhunu. Tain estate has a very turbulent history going back more than 250 years. There have been many upheavals, as is evident from the state of its historical monuments. The Shekhawati Brigade, a cavalry regiment under the command of Major Henry Forster, inflicted major damage on Tain's fort in the 1830s. The regiment was formed and raised to specifically target and bring to book the so-called \\"Rogue\\" rulers, chieftains and Thikanas of Shekhawati, who refused to pay allegiance to the Jaipur State and its British overlords. The majority of the Shekhawat rulers were opposed to their cousins, the larger Jaipur State and the British. Demographics Tain village has a population of around 5,000. It is primarily divided into three parts, according to an old custom of social hierarchy: Tain Garh is home mainly to Rajputs; Tain Johad is home to Jats and other peasant farming communities; and Tain Baas has a mainly Qaimkhani population. Many of the villagers are serving or have served in the armed or paramilitary forces and engineering services. Most of the people are dependent on agriculture, dairy, poultry farming and related activities for their livelihood. Tain is well connected to all major district roads (metalled). There is better open spaces and greenery is far better than other near location to the TAIN, and it has a BSNL telephone exchange and an electric sub-station. It is administered by a Gram Panchayat, which is democratically elected every 5 years.

This link allows the risk of the schemes to remain with the insurer, and thereby can enable greater sustainability and long-term viability. The Microinsurance Centre works on two fronts, helping to establish proper dialogue on micro-insurance policies and helping to set up proper microinsurance schemes.

History Jude's debut album, 430 N. Harper Ave, was released independently by the Fish of Death label in 1997. This caught the attention of Madonna's record label, Maverick, who signed Jude and released his second album, No One Is Really Beautiful — which contained several re-recordings of some of the debut album's tracks. Jude enjoyed a short-lived radio term on select stations throughout the US, featuring two tracks from No One Is Really Beautiful, \\"I'm Sorry Now\\" (#33 Billboard Adult Top 40 Chart) and \\"Rick James\\" (#29 Billboard Adult Top 40 Chart, #28 Billboard Modern Rock Chart). Jude first brushed with wide acclaim when his song \\"I Know\\" was featured on the multi-platinum City of Angels soundtrack, which hit #1 on the U.S. Billboard Chart, selling over five million copies in the U.S. alone. The song \\"I Do\\" from No One Is Really Beautiful was used in several television shows and is a fan favorite (and features on the first three of Jude's albums in various incarnations). During this time, Jude also toured with Alanis Morissette, Ben Folds Five, The Cranberries, Dido, Tori Amos, Better Than Ezra, Train, and Chris Isaak. His follow-up album, King of Yesterday, seems to have been a classic struggle between artist and label, and was unceremoniously released on September 11, 2001. The album featured a cover of Bread's \\"Everything I Own\\". Jude soon parted ways with Maverick and produced his subsequent albums independently (Sarah in 2004 and Redemption in 2006). When Sarah was issued via CD Baby, it hit #1 on their charts for over a month and is still one of the highest selling CDs in their history. Currently, Jude is signed with Naive records in Paris, France (where Jude toured several times and has attracted a loyal fanbase). Naive released Redemption in Europe in September 2006, and released the single \\"Save Me\\" via iTunes in October. The whole album was released stateside in November 2006, and it became available for download via iTunes in December. In 2006, Jude, Chris Seefried, Jeff Russo and Dave Gibbs formed the band Low Stars. They released an eponymous CD through the Starbucks Hear music label in 2007. The song \\"Calling All Friends\\", which appears on the album and was penned by Jude, is the theme for the ABC drama What About Brian. In August 2007, Jude left the Low Stars after deciding to focus on his own career. He is currently based in Los Angeles, writing songs for film and television. In 2015, he launched a PledgeMusic campaign to record a new EP, \\"Me and My Monster\\", published in 2016.

Sultan Ahmed was related to Sir Ali Imam and Syed Hasan Imam and like them were from bihar. While he was the first Indian Vice-Chancellor of Patna University (1923–30) he was included as a delegate from British India, to the Round Table Conference (1930–31) in London which was attended by Mahatama Gandhi. He was Member of the Bihar Legislative Council in 1937 but resigned on the grounds of not getting enough time for politics. He joined the Viceroy’s Executive Council (1941–43) and was made the Member for Information and Broadcasting. Later he was also Advisor to the Chamber of Princes (1945–47) in India. In the 1945 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI). Syed Sultan Ahmed backed M. C. Davar in his opposition to the partition of India, joining the United Party of India which aimed at bridging the gap between the Indian National Congress and All India Muslim League. Although Jinnah offered him a cabinet position in Pakistan, he stated that he could not leave India as it contained the graves of his forefathers. Sir Sultan Ahmed had previously also refused the Nizam of Hyderabad's offer of being his Prime minister as his father who was himself a lawyer reminded him of the bad experiences of his relative Sir Ali Imam in that role. After Indian Independence, Sir Sultan turned to his law practice. In 1950 he became the President of the All India Shia Conference. Sir Sultan’s grandson, Syed Tanvirul Hasan’s ‘Freedom and Partition and Seasons Changed’ records the ‘Life and Times of Sir Sultan Ahmed’. Sir Sultan edited the most popular book on Muslim Law \\"Mohammedan Law\\" for several years.

She is a young female soldier in Marlo Stanfield's drug dealing organization and Chris Partlow's earliest protégé. As one of the experienced leaders of Stanfield's crew, she commits many ruthless murders on their behalf. Character storyline=Season 3= Snoop is a gangster who first appears midway through the escalating war between the Barksdale Organization and the Stanfield Organization, as one of the new recruits in training under Chris Partlow's wing. She is often seen hanging out with Chris and other Stanfield peers before eventually being assigned her first hit by Chris, who deems her ready to kill. She is responsible for killing the Barksdale soldier Rico, in a drive-by shooting on Poot Carr's corner. She also takes part in Chris' efforts to foil an assassination attempt against Marlo Stanfield. After Omar Little and Brother Mouzone kill Stringer Bell, Snoop boasts that she and Chris Partlow had murdered him. =Season 4= Snoop is shown a year later as an adept enforcer recognized as part of Marlo's trusted inner circle. She and Chris are assigned most of the hits that Marlo initiates, with Snoop assisting Chris in many murders by way of luring the victim to a secluded area and by helping to organize the method of concealment. She is never shown as the actual murderer. The pair disposes of the bodies by depositing them in abandoned buildings, covering them with quicklime and tarps, and boarding up the buildings again. When they re-board the doors, they use the Hilti DX 460 MX powder-actuated nail gun that Snoop purchased in the first scene of the season. Later, the nail gun's distinctive nails become key clues: every house boarded up with those nails contains at least one body. Before the police discover this, however, Sergeant Hauk had pulled them over and spotted the nail gun, so Chris discarded it, to Snoop's chagrin. Among the people Chris and Snoop murder are \\"Lex\\" Anderson, Little Kevin, Old Face Andre, several New York drug dealers, and a security guard who talked back to Marlo. Tired of always concealing her crimes, Snoop tries to keep the guard's badge as a souvenir, but Chris throws the badge away. The pair were also responsible for intimidating Bodie Broadus into accepting Marlo's drug supply and for recruiting middle schooler Michael Lee into their organization. They also train the next generation of soldiers for Stanfield's organization, including O-Dog. In \\"Final Grades\\", the last episode of season 4, Snoop alludes to being a lesbian while talking to Bunk during a routine police search. =Season 5= In season 5, Snoop continues to act as muscle for Marlo, alongside Chris Partlow. Tension between her and Michael becomes a recurring theme. Snoop carries out orders from her superiors without question, but Michael tends to voice his opinion about certain situations. This occurs when Chris, Snoop, and Michael are about to make a hit on Junebug (a rival drug dealer spreading malicious but trivial words about Marlo's sexuality) and after Omar kills Savino Bratton. Snoop is murdered by Michael when he rightly suspects that she is about to kill him, due to Marlo's suspicion that he had been talking to the police about the Stanfield organization. When Michael draws his gun, Snoop compliments him on his intelligence and asks him how he knew that she was going to kill him. She accepts her fate and nonchalantly looks into the car's wing mirror. Her final words are, \\"How my hair look, Mike?\\" Michael answers, \\"You look good, girl\\", then shoots her in the head. Production=Origins= Snoop's name is seen for the first time, very briefly, in a season 3 episode, written on a Post-it Note and being pinned up to the board in the Major Crimes Unit. Her name is also pinned on the board in \\"Boys of Summer\\" (season 4, episode 1). She can be seen for the first time in the widescreen version of \\"Hamsterdam\\" (season 3, episode 4), sitting with Justin and Fruit in the gymnasium during Colvin's speech, although in that episode's original broadcast release she is cropped from the shot. Her name and picture are up on the details board under Chris Partlow as \\"Felicia Pearson AKA 'Snoop'\\". Her name can once again be seen briefly early in the season 5 episode \\"Transitions\\", as well as in Randy Wagstaff's police file in \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\". \\"Snoop\\" is the actress' nickname in real life. Reception Several critics have praised Pearson's performance as especially frightening. Writer Stephen King called the character \\"perhaps the most terrifying female villain to ever appear in a television series\\".

Technology Supermono tail section This lightweight, compact racer was built with many technical innovations that strongly influenced the design of the 916. The single cylinder Ducati racer was built with power to weight in mind. Carbon fiber pieces included bodywork, sub frame, fuel tank, rear sets, airbox and instrument housing. Magnesium was used for case covers, chain adjustment covers and triple clamps. The front suspension used an Öhlins 42 mm inverted telescopic forks, similar to those used on the Ducati 888 Corsa, and the rear used a cantilevered Ohlins DU2041 shock. It had a Termignoni exhaust and 3 spoke Marchesini magnesium wheels. The front brakes were Brembo 280 mm fully floating iron front discs and Brembo P4 30-34 racing calipers. The Supermono inherited many of its features from 888 Racing. Liquid cooled double overhead cam shaft with four valve desmodromic cylinder head. A horizontally placed 550 cc cylinder used a dummy connecting rod that acted like a second piston in terms of making the dynamic balance equivalent to a ninety degree Vee twin. This engineering was the key to overcoming vibration problems typically handled with either balance shafts or the incomplete solution of a crank counterweight. Design Supermono motor Pierre Terblanche designed the look of the Supermono and Claudio Domenicali and Massimo Bordi designed the frame, power plant and other unique parts of the motorcycle. =Fuel and spark plugs= In the mid-1990s, 100 octane aviation gas was the fuel of choice for many Supermono race teams. Spark plugs with a 54 to 55 heat index were required. Several teams used Champion spark plug QA55V.

She serves as the primary love interest to Tsukune Aono, who is the only human enrolled in a school of monsters. She has a rosary that gives her a split personality; her outer persona is kind and sweet, but her inner persona, which manifests when her rosary is removed, is a cold and serious martial artist who mainly uses powerful kicks. In the Japanese version of the anime, her voice actress is Nana Mizuki, who is also responsible for performing the theme songs for both anime seasons. In the English version, Moka's outer personality is voiced by Alexis Tipton, while her inner personality is voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard. Conception Ikeda drew inspirations from Kaibutsu-kun and has incorporated some references later into the first serialization of the Rosario+Vampire manga. In an interview at Lucca Comics 2012, Ikeda said he is a big fan of Tim Burton and was inspired by his works, including The Nightmare Before Christmas, and particularly Edward Scissorhands because the monster has a sensitive soul. He had also researched various monsters from encyclopedias and the Internet. He started with his passion for vampires, and the concept of a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix around her neck. He credits her and the other female characters for the series' popularity. Moka's name is based on the word \\"mocha\\", which is a mixed coffee drink with cocoa. Her family name (Akashiya) may be an anagram for ayakashi, which is a Japanese term for demon, spirit, or monster. Her sisters have similar drink-based names. Character outline=Background and personality= Moka is described as having two distinct personalities. The outer one manifests when she is wearing her rosary, while her inner one comes out when the rosary is removed. Some exceptions are made when she employs various magic canceling objects such as Lilith's mirror which reveals a monster's true nature, and the Belmont Whip, which when wrapped around part of her body, cancels out the rosary's power. =Outer Moka= Cheerful and positive, Moka is introduced in the series as a teenage vampire girl with long pink hair. At her debut in Yokai Academy's high school, she is immediately revered for her natural good looks and her academic ability, having placed in the teens (out of several hundred students) on one of their exams. Although she is good natured and kind, she possesses some naivety that draws her into problematic situations. Prior to the series, she is distrustful of humans, having spent much of her life in the human world, including middle school where she is shunned by her fellow students. After meeting Tsukune Aono, however, she begins to trust them. In the manga's second serialization, Tsukune and the gang learn that Moka's appearance is that of her mother Akasha Bloodriver. When Tsukune and his friends look into Moka's past, they discover that the outer Moka is a pseudo-personality that Akasha creates using the rosario, with the purpose of preserving the blood seal on Alucard, and protecting Moka's inner personality while the latter is asleep. All of her memories pertaining to Alucard are wiped. In the final chapter, Akasha reveals that Outer Moka is a clone of herself but with her memories wiped so she can protect her daughter. After Akasha disappears, Moka's father later reveals that her personality is still with Moka as long as they have memories of her. =Inner Moka= Inner Moka, Moka's true vampiric form When the rosary around Moka's neck is removed, her inner vampiric personality emerges as a deeply aristocratic, aggressive and arrogant vampire woman. Her catchphrase at the end of a fight is . Moka's inner personality is shown to have a more feminine side when she spent a day with Tsukune, similar to the outer half. It is later revealed that Inner Moka is actually Moka's true personality. As a newborn, she is injected with blood from Akasha in order to save her life. The \\"First Ancestor\\" blood that she acquires enables her to have tremendous strength and regeneration, but can only be acquired by transfusion and not by heredity. When Akasha is attacked and seemingly killed by her stepsister Aqua, Moka snaps where her First Ancestor blood is awaken, which inadvertently awakens the Vampire Lord Alucard as their blood is synchronized with him. To prevent her daughter from being eaten by Alucard so that she can have a normal life, Akasha uses a rosary to seal Moka's First Ancestor blood, and creates a pseudo-personality, \\"Outer\\" Moka, so that her inner personality can sleep. Akasha designs for Moka's inner personality to occasionally awaken when her rosario is removed by a person who truly cares about her. =Moka's Rosario= Only Tsukune can remove the rosario safely, but Moka is also able, albeit with potentially fatal side-effects. Moka's rosary was the only thing that her mother left behind after she disappeared. It was originally believed that Moka's rosary sealed her true vampiric powers. However, when Moka and her friends went to Hong Kong to see Tohofuhai, the Second Dark Lord, about fixing the rosary, Tohofuhai discovered that the rosary does not actually seal Moka's powers. Much to his surprise, it seals away Moka's memories. The whole point of sealing Inner Moka is to seal away her First Ancestor Blood, which is linked to Alucard's powers, and can only be removed by a person who truly cares for her, in other words, Tsukune. In the anime adaptation, Moka manages to bypass her rosary seal after Ruby mortally wounds Tsukune during the Witch's Knoll arc, the emotional trauma causing her Inner personality to emerge without having Tsukune remove the seal. Also, if willed on by Moka, it can hold back the awakening of Alucard. She was also able to bypass the seal on her Rosario when witnessing what she thought to be Kurumu and Mizore slain by Aqua's Dimension Sword technique. That was what caused the seal to break, and gave Gyokuro the ability to forcefully remove her cross, when normally only Tsukune could. Appearances=Manga= Ikeda draws Moka with long, pink hair and green eyes. Her inner personality, when manifested, is drawn with silver hair and red eyes. At the beginning of the series, Moka's inner personality mocks Tsukune for his personality, but as the series progresses, she shows an interest in Tsukune by letting him hold her hand in the manga, although this was done so he could learn how to sense when monsters such as her jealous classmates and friends attack. This is shown more in the anime when Moka's inner personality is left outside after her rosario is used to hold the barrier; she tries to act the same as her outer personality. Inner Moka has no experience in cooking: her attempts to cook a pumpkin pie prove disastrous, although when Tsukune tastes it he tells her he likes it, which makes her very happy. At the end of chapter 26 of the second serialization, the seal was broken sufficiently enough that Inner Moka has taken over the body and Outer Moka was forced into being the Inner personality, however the two can still converse via the rosario almost normally with each other. The seal was fixed in later chapters prior to Moka's captivity by Aqua as an emergency measure. =Anime= In each of the episodes in the anime series, when Moka's rosario is removed, there is a transformation sequence where she becomes a \\"super-vampire\\". She still has silver hair and red eyes with slit pupils, but undergoes physical changes to her body such as slightly larger hips and bust size. Her transformation is likened to those of magical girls. Her voice is deeper and more serious, and in the English version, she is voiced by a different voice actor. Following her fights as Inner Moka, the bat character announces the duration of Moka's fight. Her appearance resembles that of her father, Issa Shuzen. Character songs Moka's first character single, sung by Nana Mizuki and containing songs and , debuted at number 42 on the Oricon weekly chart. and remained on the chart for four weeks. Her character single for the second anime series, containing songs and reached number 40, and remained for a total of three weeks. Reception In reviewing the first anime series, Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews criticized Outer Moka to be ditzy and a \\"pink-haired dolt\\", with no attention to the usual vampire tropes such as exposure to sunlight, garlic and water, the last of which was explained that Moka is only vulnerable to pure water. However, he found her alternate personality to be \\"pretty damn badass\\" and \\"a great addition to the show\\", opining that he wished her backstory was explained better. Moka was elected by UGO Networks as the fortieth \\"sexiest vampire\\" of all media, with the staff commenting on her relationship with Tsukune. Lynzee Loveridge of Anime News Network listed Moka among her list of 7 Vampires That Don't Suck. References=Rosario+Vampire manga=Entire series * Ikeda, Akihisa ロザリオとバンパイア. (in Japanese) 10 vols.

The provider of food in the association is referred to as a trophobiont. The name is derived from the Greek τροφή trophē, meaning \\"nourishment\\" and -βίωσις -biosis which is short for the English symbiosis. Among the more noted trophobiotic groups are ants and members of a number of hemipteran families. A number of ant genera are recorded as tending groups of hemipterans to varying degrees. In most cases the ants collect and transport the honeydew secretions from the hemipterans back to the nest for consumption. Not all examples of ant trophobiotic interactions are mutualistic, with instances such as ants attracted to Cacopsylla pyricola feeding on both the honeydew and the C. pyricola individuals. This interaction has been recorded in Ancient Chinese writings and is noted as one of the oldest instances of biological pest control. In mutualistic relationships, the production of honeydew by trophobionts is rewarded by removal of dead hemipterans and protection from a variety of predators by the attendant ants. In some relationships the ants will build shelters for the farmed trophobionts, either to protect them or keep them from leaving the area. Some species of ants construct underground rooms to house the trophobionts and carry them between the host plant and housing area daily. In more complex obligate relationships (where both symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival) the ants will nest with the partner trophobionts in silk constructed leaf shelters or in underground colonies. Several species of migratory ants are noted to bring the trophobiont species with them when they move, transporting the trophobionts to new feeding areas and acting as a quick escape method if danger arises. While aphids, mealybugs and other more sedentary hemipterans are most often used as trophobionts, occasional instances of more active hemipterans such as leafhoppers have been recorded. In such instances in southern Africa, larger ant genera such as Camponotus are more successful at herding and containment of the leafhoppers. Smaller ant genera have been observed to tend younger or smaller leafhoppers for short periods, and in some cases, small ant genera were observed visiting herds tended by large ant genera. In these cases it is suggested the small ant genera may have been stealing honeydew droplets from the herd. Ants of the entirely subterranean genus Acropyga have a noted trophobiotic relationship with mealybugs, being considered obligate coccidophiles and living in the same nests with their trophobionts. Queens of at least eleven living Acropyga species have been observed carrying a \\"seed\\" trophobiont in their mandibles during the mating flight, and it is suggested the seed is then used to start the mealybug colony in the queen's new nest. The level of dependency between Acrophyga and their trophobiont is suggested to be such that neither can survive without the other. An experiment using a captive colony of A. epedana showed that even when the colony was starved the ant refused offered food alternatives. This specific behavior has also been documented in Dominican amber fossils dating back , with queens of the fossil species Acropyga glaesaria being found preserved with species of the extinct mealybug genus Electromyrmococcus. Older trophobiotic associations have been suggested for the Eocene fossil ant species Ctenobethylus goepperti based on a Baltic amber fossil entombing thirteen C. goepperti workers intermingled with a number of aphids. Convergent behavior to that of Acropyga is displayed by the arboreal ant Tetraponera binghami. This species lives in hollow internodes of giant bamboos and new queens will also carry a seed mealybug during the mating flight.

It was developed in the early 1970s by Computer Information Management Company and was subsequently owned by Insyte, Applied Data Research, Ameritech, and Computer Associates International, Inc.. Datacom is now owned by CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates), which renamed it to CA-Datacom/DB and later to CA Datacom/DB.  Origin  The genesis of modern DBMS technology occurred in the 1970s with the advent of huge databases that were cumbersome to manage and maintain. As long as most mainframe processing was done in batch mode, the rapidity of maintenance operations was not a key ingredient to success. During the 1970s however, the introduction of online systems required that information become quickly available and dynamically maintained. Some of the most dramatic changes occurred in the banking and credit industry: * Large banks needed to manage tens of millions of banking account records in real- time rather than utilizing off-shift batch processing as they had done historically * Credit bureaus needed to maintain and dynamically update massive customer credit files for millions of citizens and businesses. Datacom was initially designed to rapidly retrieve data from massive files using Inverted List technology. Although very well suited for rapid retrieval, it was less effective when handling large amounts of data maintenance. To solve this problem, Datacom/DB transitioned to relational technology utilizing special index-driven capabilities that radically improved maintenance with no loss in retrieval speed. This relational version of Datacom served as the foundation for a continuing stream of industry-leading enhancements that have preserved its position as an extremely cost-effective and high-performing DBMS for the IBM mainframe.  History = Credit Bureau industry = In the 1950s and 1960s, credit bureaus were local organizations that maintained paper records about local borrowers and retail customers, usually storing these records in small envelopes filed in literally hundreds of file cabinets. In fact, one major credit bureau attempted to speed up its transaction rate by having its employees wear roller skates to move rapidly from file cabinet to file cabinet! In 1965, a project was initiated by IBM to use its new System/360 mainframe computers to automate the two largest credit bureaus - Chilton Corporation of Dallas and the Credit Bureau of Greater Houston - and the national association of credit bureaus. Three IBM veterans were selected to head up the development team. At the successful conclusion of this project, the three men agreed that their credit industry automation experience could equip them to build systems for other credit bureaus, so they collaborated to start Computer Information Management Company in Dallas in 1968. = Computer Information Management Co. = right The team’s specialty with IBM had been the development of telecommunication-based applications. Building on this expertise, one of CIM’s first contracts was with First National Bank of Fort Worth, for which CIM designed an online teller system. At this time CICS was not functioning well, so CIM wrote a general purpose telecommunications monitor system which was later packaged and named Generalized Multi-Tasking Monitor (GMT). Many of the subsequent consulting jobs undertaken by CIM were in the finance industry. At that time, savings and loan institutions were characterized by having huge collections of data but very few daily transactions. Because there were serious performance problems with ISAM, CIM designed a key-driven adjunct to GMT to manage the data for a large West Coast savings bank. This implementation became the foundation of Datacom/DB. CIM continued to procure heavily-technical programming and consulting jobs and to sell GMT as a product. However, GMT was a tough product to sell to most executives because it was a very technical sale. Top management in many prospective companies usually did not have the technical knowledge to understand the requirements of a teleprocessing monitor. Consequently, CIM needed to find prospective sites with technically knowledgeable data processing (DP) managers or sites that gave significant executive power to their lead technicians. = Insyte = right In the early 1970s a Houston- based venture capitalist acquired a small group of companies which he named Information System Technologies (known as Insyte and pronounced “insight”). In 1974 Insyte acquired CIM’s promissory notes to gain control of CIM. Insyte replaced top management and made the decision to split the teleprocessing monitor from its key-driven access method and rename the two parts as Datacom/DC (for data communications) and Datacom/DB (for database). To emphasize the products’ relationship with Insyte, the company was renamed Insyte Datacom. Datacom/DB’s primary competitors at this time were IDMS, IMS, DL/1, ADABAS, DBOMP, and Cincom Systems' TOTAL. Although still a very small company, Insyte Datacom became well known throughout the marketplace for the outstanding speed and efficiency of its Datacom/DB and Datacom/DC applications. = Applied Data Research = right In 1978 Insyte sold Insyte Datacom to Applied Data Research, which was based in Princeton, New Jersey. This sale came about as a result of a business relationship that had been created between Insyte and ADR by which Datacom/DC was provided to ADR/Vollie clients as an online programmer’s workstation. In the late 1970s ADR recognized that DBMS products were going to become increasingly important – and set out to acquire one. After a 2-year search ADR acquired the assets and people of Insyte Datacom in November 1978. ADR began aggressively marketing Datacom in the United States and worldwide.  IDEAL  The ADR sales force concentrated on Datacom/DB and enjoyed remarkable success worldwide with several thousand clients in dozens of industries. As an offshoot of this success ADR recognized the need for a highly efficient and sophisticated application development language for Datacom/DB. This development language would need to offset the normal difficulties of writing telecommunication- based application programs. ADR’s Princeton-based application language development team had developed MetaCOBOL, which generated detailed and accurate COBOL statements from a high-level logical language set. Soon after the purchase of Datacom the team designed IDEAL. “Interactive Development Environment for an Application Lifecycle” was a watershed achievement in database application language development. Combining IDEAL and its highly- productive programming environment with Datacom/DB’s ease-of-use and Datacom/DC’s high performance gave ADR a very potent product combination which dominated industry performance throughout the 1980s.  Datacom/DC vs. IBM's CICS and VTAM  Datacom/DC was designed as a solution to CICS’ difficult- to-use and poorly performing characteristics. Although Datacom/DC solved virtually all of CICS’s shortcomings and provided high performance, IBM continued to pour massive resources into CICS. VTAM’s introduction in the late 1980s meant that much of Datacom/DC would have to be gutted and rewritten. Rather than pursue this tack, ADR chose to back out of that marketplace and replaced Datacom/DC with CICS Services as the interface between CICS, Datacom and later, IDEAL. Even though IDEAL was originally designed to work only with Datacom/DB, IDEAL was subsequently developed as a service for DB2.  DATACOM/DB for Edos  ADR licensed DATACOM/DB to TCSC, a firm which sold modified versions of IBM's DOS/360 and DOS/VS operating systems, known as Edos (later also known as Edos/VS and Edos/VSE). When, in 1980, Nixdorf Computer bought TCSC, Nixdorf sought to continue the licensing arrangement; ADR and NCSC went to court in a dispute over whether the licensing arrangement was terminated by the acquisition. ADR and Nixdorf settled out of court in 1981, with an agreement that Nixdorf could continue to resell ADR's products. = Ameritech = right In 1986 ADR was acquired by Chicago-based Ameritech. Ameritech’s primary motivation was a belief that communications and software would eventually become intertwined and Ameritech wanted to be in the game at the outset. = Computer Associates = x100px Although Ameritech’s original motivation would prove accurate in later years, Ameritech sold ADR to Computer Associates in 1988. The acquisition by CA incorporated Datacom/DB and IDEAL into CA’s already large family of mainframe products. One of the hallmarks of Datacom/DB has been its ability to provide major new enhancements to existing application programs without requiring any recoding. Datacom/DB and IDEAL remain major CA products today and are the data processing backbones of many Fortune 500 companies as well as many U.S. federal agencies.  CA, Inc. v ISI Pty Limited  In 2012, CA was successful in a lawsuit against an Australian software company, ISI Pty Limited, which offered a software product \\"2BDB2\\" designed to simplify migration from Datacom to IBM's DB2 relational database. 2BDB2 contained macros designed to interoperate with those CA macros used by software to access Datacom, but which instead connected to DB2. The Federal Court of Australia found that 2BDB2's macros were based on those included in CA Datacom, and thus infringed on CA's copyright; while there is an interoperability exception under Australian copyright law, the Federal Court adopted a narrow reading of that exception, rendering it largely unavailable to ISVs such as ISI. The Federal Court also found that ISI had illegally relied on CA's confidential information in developing the 2BDB2 product.  CADRE  right The first Datacom user conference was held in Dallas in 1974. Every year since then an annual user conference has been held. When Insyte Datacom was sold to ADR in 1978, the conferences continued and they were renamed CADRE. So CADRE or its logical predecessor has been in existence since 1974.

In 892/893 together with Arnulf of Carinthia he attacked Great Moravia to secure the eastern borders of the Frankish Empire. Arnulf gave him all the captured lands in Moravia. Kurszán also occupied the southern part of Hungary that had belonged to the Bulgarian Kingdom. He entered into an alliance with the Byzantine emperor Leo VI after realizing the country's vulnerability from the south. Together they surprisingly defeated the army of Simeon I of Bulgaria. In the summer of 904 Louis the Child invited Kurszán and his entourage to negotiate at the river Fischa. All were murdered there. From this point Árpád became the only ruler and occupied some of the territory of his former partner. The Kurszán family settled near Óbuda where they built Kurszánvára (meaning Castle of Kurszán). After Kurszán's death, they lived under the name Kartal. There are toponymic traces of Kurszán on the right side of the Danube.

It has been a National Park Service site since 1966.Harmony Hall , PackYourGear.com website Harmony Hall is a -story Georgian country house built of red brick during the eighteenth century. It is surrounded by of land on Broad Creek, a Potomac River tributary.Harmony Hall, National Park Service official website The house was built circa 1769 by Enoch Magruder. After his death, the estate was given to his daughter, Sarah and her husband, Col. William Lyles. The estate was originally called Battersea, but came to be called Harmony Hall some time after 1792, when it was rented to brothers John and Walter Dulaney Addison and their wives. The name \\"Harmony Hall\\" commemorates the two couples' harmonious coexistence. Harmony Hall was sold by the Lyles family in 1850. After passing through other owners, the manor was purchased in about 1892 by Robert Stein, his brother Richard, and brother-in- law Joseph Adler. The three had immigrated from Silesia, and engaged in truck farming nearby. They lost control of the manor house in 1929, selling it to Charles Collins, but continued to farm and operate a general store in the area. The home was extensively restored beginning in 1927 by Charles Wallace Collins (1879–1964), a lawyer, writer, and librarian who made his home in Harmony Hall and devoted himself to its restoration after he retired.Papers of Charles Wallace Collins, University of Maryland Libraries website Collins bequeathed the house to the National Park Service. Beginning in 1985, Frank Calhoun leased the mansion and lived there, investing more than $1 million into the house and its upkeep. After he fell behind on renovations in his early 60s, the Park Service asked Calhoun to leave in 1999. The property has been empty and in accelerating decline since then. Though the Park Service periodically sends in staff and enlists students to clean up the grounds, Harmony Hall competes with many other historic properties for attention and funding. The home has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980, at which time its condition was described as \\"excellent\\". , Harmony Hall is closed to the public.Harmony Hall Directions, National Park Service official website Harmony Hall is also the name given to a community center building, on adjacent property, owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and used as their southern area headquarters office. The center includes a fitness center and hosts concerts, stage plays, art exhibits, arts classes, scout meetings, and other cultural programs. The building was originally an elementary school.

Derek Fox started the scoring for Penn State, with a 34-yard interception return for a touchdown. In the second quarter, quarterback Rashard Casey threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eddie Drummond. After a scoreless third quarter, Rashard Casey scored on a 4-yard run, to put Penn State up 21–0. Travis Forney then capped the game with a 39-yard field goal.

Ranked #3 in the preseason polls, the team won their first nine games, including victories at #8 Miami and when hosting #4 Arizona. However, the Nittany Lions then lost their last three games by a combined 12 points, dropping them to fourth place in the Big Ten Conference. This was the only shutout bowl victory during Joe Paterno's tenure as head coach of Penn State. The only other bowl shutout for Penn State was a 7–0 defeat of Alabama in the 1959 Liberty Bowl. The game was Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky's last. It is also alleged that Sandusky engaged in sexual misconduct with a minor during the trip to the 1999 Alamo Bowl.

C. Speir Johnson recorded 29 songs for the American Record Company (ARC). His complete canon of recordings includes these 29 masters, plus 13 surviving alternate takes, all recorded at two ARC sessions held in San Antonio and Dallas, Texas. The Mississippi Delta—two hundred miles of fertile lowlands stretching from Memphis, Tennessee, in the north to Vicksburg, Mississippi, in the south—was one of the primary locales in which the blues originated and developed.Random House: Vicksburg to Memphis He is said to have been heavily influenced by early blues artists like Skip James,Dicaire, David. Blues Singers: Biographies of 50 Legendary Artists of the Early 20th, McFarland & Company (1999), page 20 – who was recorded in 1931, around the same time that Johnson amazed his elders with his mastery of the guitar. James's eerie, distinctive style is reflected throughout Johnson's recordings, most notably in \\"32-20 Blues,\\" which he adapted from James's \\"22-20 Blues.\\" Johnson's first session in San Antonio took place over three days – November 23 26, and 27, 1936. Sixteen songs were recorded in the Gunter Hotel, where ARC had set up equipment to record several musical artists. \\"Kind Hearted Woman Blues\\" was the first song recorded. Also captured in San Antonio were \\"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\\" and \\"Sweet Home Chicago,\\" both of which became post-war blues standards. \\"Terraplane Blues,\\" known for its metaphoric lyrics, became a regional hit and Johnson's signature song. Most of the selections were released on Vocalion 78 rpm records, but three songs and several interesting alternate takes remained unissued until they appeared on the Columbia albums. Six months later, on June 19 and 20, 1937, other recording sessions took place in a Dallas warehouse where, once again, ARC had set up its recording equipment to capture many different musicians. This time 13 songs were recorded and 10 were released during the following year. Reception and influence While Robert Johnson's professional recording career can be measured in months, his musical legacy has survived more than 70 years. Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, two prominent Chicago bluesmen, have their roots in the Delta: both knew Robert Johnson, and were heavily influenced by him. Johnson's emotive vocals, combined with his varied and masterful guitar playing, continue to influence blues and popular music performers to this day. In 2004, Eric Clapton recorded Me and Mr. Johnson as a tribute to the legendary bluesman; the album reached number six on the Billboard 200 and has sold more than 563,000 copies in the United States.Billboard: Eric Clapton The Chicago Tribunes Greg Kot wrote that The Complete Recordings, along with Clapton's The Layla Sessions (1990), survive as \\"monuments of 20th Century music that will rarely, if ever, be equaled\\".Kot, Greg. \\"A Blue Rendezvous: Johnson and Clapton Speak the Same Language\\".

It addresses a common problem known as head-of-line blocking.  Description  In VOQ, the physical buffer of each input port maintains a separate virtual queue for each output port. Therefore congestion on an egress port will block only the virtual queue for this particular egress port. Other packets in the same physical buffer destined to different (non-congested) output ports are in separate virtual queues and can therefore still be processed. In a traditional setup, the blocked packet for the congested egress port would have blocked the whole physical buffer, resulting in head-of-line blocking. It has been shown that VOQ can achieve 100% throughput performance with an effective scheduling algorithm. This scheduling algorithm should be able to provide a high speed mapping of packets from inputs to outputs on a cycle-to-cycle basis. The VOQ mechanism provides throughput at a much higher rate than the crossbar switches without it. There are many algorithms for design and implementation of fast VOQ. For example, Nick McKeown and a group at Stanford University published a design in 1997. Quality of service and priority are extensions found in literature of the same time. VOQ scheduling is often referred to as \\"arbitration\\" (resolving the concurrent access wishes), whereas the ordering of packets (\\"packet scheduling\\") is an additional task following the VOQ arbitration.

Instead, he traveled throughout the country and devoted himself to studies. Biography Statue of Gu Yanwu in Tinglin Park, Kunshan Gu, a native of Jiangsu, was born as Gu Jiang (). Gu began his schooling at the age of 14. In the spring of 1645, Gu was recommended to be the position of Bingbu Siwu in the royal court at Nanjing. There he proposed many ideas. Unsatisfied with the royal court's organization, Gu resigned and returned to his hometown. In 1655, local officials laid charges against him and threw him into prison. He was released from prison with the help of a friend. Inspired by Chen Di, who had demonstrated that the Old Chinese has its own phonological system, Gu divided the words of Old Chinese into 10 rhyme groups, the first one to do so. His positivist approach to a variety of disciplines, and his criticism of Neo-Confucianism had a huge influence on later scholars. His works include Yinxue Wushu (), Ri Zhi Lu () and Zhao Yu Zhi (). Along with Wang Fuzhi and Huang Zongxi, Gu was named as one of the most outstanding Confucian scholars of the late Ming and early Qing Dynasty.

It is based on the fictional world of Dinotopia, a utopia in which sentient dinosaurs and humans coexist, created by American author James Gurney. The miniseries uses plot details from Gurney's first two Dinotopia books, Dinotopia (1992) and Dinotopia: The World Beneath (1995), although it takes place in a time farther into the future. The main characters are two American teenage boys from a contemporary time frame (unlike the 19th century castaways in the books—the film thus loses some of the classicism of the original books).. Moria.co.nz, article, \\"Dinotopia\\" ?, 2002. The boys crash their father's plane into the sea and get stranded on Dinotopia, where they must adjust to a new society. The story in the film contains references to many of the characters in the book series, with some of their descendants occupying key roles in the plot. The original score was composed by Trevor Jones. This score is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Geoffrey Alexander. The miniseries premiered as installments of The Wonderful World of Disney from May 12–14, 2002 on ABC. It received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. It was soon followed by a television series which only lasted for one season. Plot A pair of teenage half-brothers, Karl and David Scott, are on a flight with their father Frank on his private plane when Karl takes over the controls, so his father can fall asleep. After flying into a storm, Karl struggles, causing Frank to retake control before it crashes into the ocean. Frank saves his sons, but has trouble escaping the crashed plane as his seatbelt fails to release. Karl and David wash up on the shore of a large uncharted island. Looking for help, Karl and David meet a man named Cyrus Crabb who informs them that they are in Dinotopia, a hidden civilization where human beings and dinosaurs co-exist peacefully. Crabb leads the boys to a village, where the boys are surprised to see that they are wearing clothes from different cultures in different time periods. There, they witness a young Dinotopian woman, Marion Waldo, pacify a Ankylsaurus with a toothache. The two boys befriend her and hitch a Brachiasaur \\"bus\\" ride to Waterfall City. During the journey, the \\"Brachs\\" become distressed by an unseen presence. Marion, David, Karl and the Brach bus conductor investigate the forest nearby and find Tyrannosaurus Rex footprints. Marion is unsettled by this, as Tyrannosauruses do not usually hunt in packs and that they are \\"not evil, just hungry by nature\\". She begins to sense a strange unbalance, after discovering the destroyed remains of a Dinotopian village. For the Brachs's safety, the group spends the night in the village. Later in the night, the group is attacked by the raiding T-Rex pack. Karl, David and Marion run for their lives, as the Tyrannosaurus hunt them down. Marion trips and falls, and is nearly killed by a T-Rex when a group of Skybax Riders, humans riding on Pterodactyl-like dinosaurs, distract and scare away the Tyrannosauruses. The Skybax squadron leader, Oonu, offers to escort the Brachs to Waterfall. In fact, some of the dinosaurs, notably a neurotic but friendly Stenonychosaurus named Zippo, possess human intelligence and speak perfect English. Among the many rules in Dinotopia is the edict that, once an outsider arrives, he or she is never allowed to leave. As Karl and David prepare to take their places in their new surroundings, both boys develop a strong bond with young Marion, who is on the verge of becoming a \\"matriarch\\" of the Dinotopian society. Legend has it that their ancestors lived in an underworld that was lit by sunstones. Cyrus has been stealing artifacts and books to try and find a way off the island. Zippo discovers all the stolen items, but Cyrus knocks him out and throws him in a water canal. Meanwhile, Karl finds a Dino egg and gets sent on a mission by himself. The sun-stones keep mysteriously breaking which causes the dinos to attack. David needs to learn to conquer his fears. Unfortunately, the incursion of vicious carnivores, not to mention an unanticipated human villain, threaten to destroy Dinotopia and everyone living there. Cast * Wentworth Miller as David Scott; a dolphinback newly arrived to Dinotopia and Karl's half-brother. He becomes the first human to partner with a Pteranodon (\\"Freefall\\"). Bookish, practical yet kind, David is the brother who wants to stay in Dinotopia. He learns about reconciling differences with his brother and facing his fears (most notably his fear of heights) during his time in Dinotopia. He plays a heroic role in saving Waterfall City from a Pteranodon attack. * Tyron Leitso as Karl Scott; a dolphinback newly arrived to Dinotopia and David's half-brother. He is partnered with a baby Chasmosaur he dubs 26. Reckless, rebellious, yet charming, Karl initially doesn't want to stay in Dinotopia and find the boys' father. He learns about responsibility during his time in Dinotopia. He plays a heroic role in opening the Dinotopians' eyes of the danger the failing sunstones and how their seeming arrogance has led them astray from the real issue of the imbalance. * David Thewlis as Cyrus Crabb; the son of the books' villain Lee Crabb, and the main antagonist of the miniseries. Deceitful and underhanded, Cyrus Crabb has a derisive view towards Dinotopian Society. * Katie Carr as Marion Waldo; a beautiful, young Dinotopian woman who is the granddaughter of the books' protagonist Oriana Nascava and the daughter of Mayor Waldo of Waterfall City. Level-headed, yet spunky and idealistic, she serves as David and Karl's guide in Dinotopia. She has a rebellious streak, but uses her rebelliousness for the greater good and believes in doing for what is right. Both Karl and David develop a crush on her. She and Zippo share a platonic friendship and in the end, they become \\"Life Partners\\". * Jim Carter as Lord Mayor Waldo Seville; the Mayor of Waterfall City, Rosemary's estranged husband, and Marion's father. At first appearing joyous over the Scott Brothers' arrival, he shows a dark side to his personality as an arrogant ruler who is oblivious of how urgency of the failing sunstones and the imminent dangers of the sunstones' failing. In spite of his arrogance, Mayor Waldo deeply cares for his daughter, Marion, and wants the best for her. Eventually, he does realize the error of his ways and comes to fully understand the danger of Dinotopia's fall. Following David's heroic actions in saving Dinotopia, he pardons the Scott brothers and awards David for his bravery. * Alice Krige as Rosemary Waldo; the Matriarch of the Earth Farm, Waldo's estranged wife, and Marion's mother. A Level-headed, spiritually- centered pacifist, Rosemary has faith in Marion, even believing her claims that there is an imbalance, something her estranged husband has failed to notice. In the end, she gets back together with a reformed Mayor Waldo. * Colin Salmon as Capt. Oonu; the stoic leader of the Skybax corps and the grandson of Oolu, who held the same position in the books. Strict and no- nonsense, he has high ambitions for his cadets, especially in David, whom he sees potential, in spite of the latter's fear of heights. * Hannah Yelland as Cadet Romana Denison; a Skybax rider, the daughter of the books' protagonist Will Denison and presumably of Sylvia. * Lee Evans as Zippo (formally, Prof. Zippo Steneosaurus); a Stenonychosaurus scholar and the former partner of Sylvia of the Hatchery, a supporting protagonist in the books. Neurotic, yet mild-mannered and highly intelligent, he is very loyal to the Scott boys and has a platonic fondness for Marion. He speaks with an English accent. * Terry Jones as Messenger Bird (voice). A Prehistoric parrot-like bird who acts as a long distance mailman and telegram deliverer. In a running gag, he says \\"End of Message.\\" whenever he completes finishing a message. * Stuart Wilson as Frank Scott; the father of David and Karl, believed killed in the storm that brought his sons to Dinotopia. * Anna Maguire as Samantha, daughter of Waldo and Rosemary Seville and sister of Marion Waldo. * Geraldine Chaplin as Grandmother Oriana; the only character from the books to appear in person in the series. Production Plans for a Dinotopia film were previously rejected due to the expense of creating a world populated by both humans and dinosaurs. Both Columbia Pictures and Disney at one time made the attempt, but both studios abandoned the idea, with Disney opting to make their own homegrown film, Dinosaur in 2000. Hallmark Entertainment chief Robert Halmi Sr. then purchased the rights after having seen Gurney's book. Halmi was willing to spend $80 million on the film, despite the performance of his previous fantasy miniseries, The Tenth Kingdom.. Entertainment Weekly, On the Air, \\"Dinotopia\\" October 13, 2000. ABC had so much confidence in the miniseries that they began shooting episodes of the spin-off television series before the miniseries had aired. More than 75% of the scenes in the miniseries required visual effects, many of which required interaction between the live-action human actors and the animatronic or computer-animated dinosaurs. The computer-animated dinosaurs were created by a London-based company, Framestore CFC, who also did the CGI work for the Walking with Dinosaurs series. The series also used other visual effects techniques such as digital set extensions. Many of the sets were only partially built, the rest being done digitally, in order to create the enormous buildings used by both dinosaurs and humans in the film. Even so, the actual set for Waterfall City, Dinotopia's capital, took up five-and-a- half acres of the back lot of England's Pinewood Studios. Jim Henson's Creature Shop provided the animatronic dinosaurs. Although Dinotopia started out as a TV miniseries, later all the parts were combined and put on DVD as one film, except in the UK, where the mini-series was put onto discs as separate episodes.

It was constructed to explain the observation of the u=1/3 fractional quantum Hall effect, and predicted the existence of additional u = 1/n states as well as quasiparticle excitations with fractional electric charge e/n, both of which were later experimentally observed. Laughlin received one third of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1998 for this discovery. Being a trial wavefunction, it is not exact, but qualitatively, it reproduces many features of the exact solution and quantitatively, it has very high overlaps with the exact ground state for small systems. If we ignore the jellium and mutual Coulomb repulsion between the electrons as a zeroth order approximation, we have an infinitely degenerate lowest Landau level (LLL) and with a filling factor of 1/n, we'd expect that all of the electrons would lie in the LLL. Turning on the interactions, we can make the approximation that all of the electrons lie in the LLL. If \\\\psi_0 is the single particle wavefunction of the LLL state with the lowest orbital angular momenta, then the Laughlin ansatz for the multiparticle wavefunction is : \\\\langle z_1,z_2,z_3,\\\\ldots , z_N \\\\mid n,N\\\\rangle = \\\\psi_{n,N}(z_1,z_2, z_3, \\\\ldots, z_N ) = D \\\\left[ \\\\prod_{N \\\\geqslant i > j \\\\geqslant 1}\\\\left( z_i-z_j \\\\right)^n \\\\right] \\\\prod^N_{k=1}\\\\exp\\\\left( - \\\\mid z_k \\\\mid^2 \\\\right) where position is denoted by :z={1 \\\\over 2 \\\\mathit l_B} \\\\left( x + iy\\\\right) in (Gaussian units) : \\\\mathit l_B = \\\\sqrt{\\\\hbar c\\\\over e B} and x and y are coordinates in the xy plane. Here \\\\hbar is Planck's constant, e is the electron charge, N is the total number of particles, and B is the magnetic field, which is perpendicular to the xy plane. The subscripts on z identify the particle. In order for the wavefunction to describe fermions, n must be an odd integer. This forces the wavefunction to be antisymmetric under particle interchange. The angular momentum for this state is n\\\\hbar . Energy of interaction for two particles Figure 1. Interaction energy vs. {\\\\mathit l} for n=7 and k_Br_B=20. The energy is in units of {e^2 \\\\over L_B}. Note that the minima occur for {\\\\mathit l} =3 and {\\\\mathit l} =4. In general the minima occur at {\\\\mathit l \\\\over n} = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pm {1\\\\over 2n}. The Laughlin wavefunction is the multiparticle wavefunction for quasiparticles. The expectation value of the interaction energy for a pair of quasiparticles is : \\\\langle V \\\\rangle = \\\\langle n, N \\\\mid V \\\\mid n, N\\\\rangle, \\\\; \\\\; \\\\; N=2 where the screened potential is (see Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field) : V\\\\left( r_{12}\\\\right) = \\\\left( { 2 e^2 \\\\over L_B}\\\\right) \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} {{k\\\\;dk \\\\;} \\\\over k^2 + k_B^2 r_{B}^2 } \\\\; M \\\\left ( \\\\mathit l + 1, 1, -{k^2 \\\\over 4} \\\\right) \\\\;M \\\\left ( \\\\mathit l^{\\\\prime} + 1, 1, -{k^2 \\\\over 4} \\\\right) \\\\;\\\\mathcal J_0 \\\\left ( k{r_{12}\\\\over r_{B}} \\\\right) where M is a confluent hypergeometric function and \\\\mathcal J_0 is a Bessel function of the first kind.
