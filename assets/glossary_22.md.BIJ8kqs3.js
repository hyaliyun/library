She danced for many prominent companies, including the American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet, and later started her own school, the New York School of Ballet, with husband Richard Thomas. Early life Barbara Fallis was born in 1924 in Denver, Colorado. Shortly after, her family moved from the United States to London, England for her father's work. The Fallis family remained in London for 12 years until WWII. Her love and pursuit of dance began during this time. She and her mother attended many performances by notable dance companies of the time, including Ballet Russe, which spurred Barbara's interest in dance at a young age. Fallis began her more serious study of dance at the age of 12 with Joan Lawson. Shortly after, she auditioned to train under Ninette De Valois for the Vic-Wells Ballet. Fallis studied at the Sadler's Wells Ballet School, directly tied to the Vic-Wells Ballet, which would later become the Royal Ballet. Ninette De Valois only allowed dancers into the school that she believed were worthy of also being in the company, which gave Barbara many opportunities to begin performing in the corps de ballet. However, her time at the Vic-Wells was short lived, as the Fallis family was forced to move back to the United States because of the war. Life and career Upon relocation to America, the Fallis family settled in New York City. Here Barbara was able to audition for Ballet Theatre with Lucia Chase. She began dancing with Ballet Theatre, later know as American Ballet Theatre, in 1941 at the age of 16. Her first performance with the company was in Les Sylphides in Mexico. During her eight years with Ballet Theatre, Fallis worked with many prominent choreographers, including Michel Fokine, Anthony Tudor, Bronislava Nijinska, and George Balanchine in many original works for the company. For example, she was in the corps de ballet of Anthony Tudor's Pillar of Fire, which premiered for the first time in 1942. In 1948, she had a leading role in Les Patineurs, alongside John Kriza and Cynthia Risely. Fallis said she preferred roles in the company, over soloist parts, as it enabled her to perform as much as possible. In 1948, Barbara Fallis left Ballet Theatre to join Company Alicia Alonso (now the Cuban National Ballet) in Cuba. It was in Cuba that she met fellow dancer and husband Richard Thomas. The couple married in Cuba in 1950 and had their first child, Richard Thomas, in 1951, before returning to New York in 1953. Upon their return to New York City, both Barbara and Richard secured positions in the New York City Ballet dancing with Balanchine. Fallis remained with New York City Ballet until 1958. During that time, she danced in such performances as Western Symphony and Balanchine's first Nutcracker. In 1958, she left New York City Ballet and began a short period of performances at Jacob's Pillow. In 1963, Barbara and Richard founded The New York School of Ballet where they began to train young dancers. During the early days of the school's founding, the couple also alternated teaching at the Pennsylvania Ballet in Philadelphia which helped fund their school. In 1969, the school relocated to the former studios of the School of American Ballet after being offered the space by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kerstein. Here, they trained noteworthy students of the school such as Eliot Feld, Twyla Tharp, Sean Lavery, Debbie Allen, Cynthia Gregory, and Christine Sarry. Later in 1975, subsequent to Feld's departure from the school, Barbara and Richard founded the company U.S. Terpsichore to provide their students with performance opportunities. The couple's second child, Bronwyn Thomas, as well as their son, Richard Thomas, were among the performing members of the company. Her son, Richard, was also a well-known child actor, who performed on the television series The Waltons. The company toured a wide variety of repertory including over 30 ballets in both contemporary and classical styles. U.S. Terpsichore was very successful, and the funds raised from the touring performances continually funded the New York School of Ballet. Barbara Fallis taught at the school alongside her husband until her death on September 5, 1980. She died at New York Hospital, where she was being treated for cancer, at age 56.

Cameron was shot at eleven times by a member of the Salt Lake City Police Department after Cameron ran from his house during a mental breakdown. Shooting On September 4, Linden Cameron's mother, Golda Barton had made a 9-1-1 call asking for a crisis intervention team because Cameron was having a mental breakdown, and said that she feared Cameron could become violent. Barton said on body camera footage from the incident released by authorities, ‚ÄúI need him to go to a hospital. I cannot get him there on my own and I cannot do this every night.‚Äù Barton said law enforcement were a trigger for Cameron. Barton‚Äôs father, Owen Barton, had been killed in a confrontation with Lyon County sheriff's deputies earlier in the year. Golda Barton said in the body camera video, ‚ÄúHe sees the badge and he automatically thinks like, you‚Äôre going to kill him, or he has to defend himself in some way. He freaks out. And he‚Äôs got a sensory disorder.‚Äù Two officers stayed near the home of Linden Cameron and Golda Barton, while an officer in the driveway spotted Cameron running. Officers gave chase to Cameron, and broke through the fence which he jumped over. An officer yelled, \\"Get on the ground!\\" moments before firing eleven shots at Cameron.

Tell my mom I love her.\\" According to Barton, one officer said to the one who shot Cameron, \\"He's just a child, what are you doing?\\" Salt Lake City police later stated that there was no indication or evidence to suggest that Cameron had a weapon. Response from family and local officials After the shooting, Cameron's mother, Golda Barton told KUTV, \\"I said, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs unarmed, he doesn‚Äôt have anything, he just gets mad and he starts yelling and screaming,‚Äô He's a kid, he's trying to get attention, he doesn't know how to regulate. They're supposed to come out and be able to de-escalate a situation using the most minimal force possible... He's a small child. Why didn't you just tackle him? He's a baby. He has mental issues.\\" Barton set up a fundraiser on GoFundMe for Cameron's medical expenses, which has raised $105,844 as of September 27, 2020. Linden Cameron's 17-year old brother, Wesley Barton said of the shooting, \\"It‚Äôs horrible. To see your little brother bleeding out, saying his last words. It plays in my head over and over.\\" Wesley Barton also said that he had been told that Linden Cameron will probably not be able to walk again. Salt Lake City mayor Erin Mendenhall said of the incident, \\"As a member of this community and as the mother of a 14-year old boy, I am profoundly heartbroken and I am frustrated. This shooting is another tragedy. It‚Äôs a tragedy for this young boy, for his mother, and for families and individuals who have acute mental health needs. I think the community will look at this situation and they will see themselves or their loved ones reflected in it.\\" Salt Lake City police chief Mike Brown stated, \\"A 13-year old boy was shot and as a father of three sons, this has had an impact on me personally. I know that this has made an impression on the women and men of the Salt Lake City Police Department and of course you, the community we serve.

In 2014, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Early life and education Hirschl was born on September 23, 1963. He studied political science at Tel Aviv University in Israel and, upon receiving a Fulbright scholarship, he received his doctorate from Yale University in 1999.

Prior to his appointment, Hirschl published his first book titled Towards Juristocracy in 2004 through the Harvard University Press. His book argued that constitutional reform understood as the transfer of power from representative institutions to judiciaries is often the product of a strategic move he termed \\"hegemonic preservation\\" lead by challenged political elites who aspire to entrench their worldviews and policy preferences against the vicissitudes of democratic politics. The following year, Hirschl and his wife Ayelet Shachar were awarded Canada Research Chairs (CRC) positions, with him being appointed a Tier 1 CRC in Constitutionalism, Democracy, and Development. As a Canada Research Chair, Hirschl published his second book on the topic of Constitutional theocracy which received the 2011 Mahoney Prize in Legal Theory from the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence in the Faculty of Law at the University of Sydney.

Shirelijan played with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers for 11 years and was an important part of their three consecutive Grand Finals from 2009 to 2011 and their first championship in the 2016‚Äì17 season. He is widely regarded as the most iconic player of the Xinjiang Flying Tigers and a popular contender for the all-time greatest Flying Tiger.  Career  Shirelijan Muxtar was promoted to the first team of Xinjiang Flying Tigers and debuted in Chinese Basketball Association in the 2008‚Äì09 season. He was an important part of the team's three consecutive trips to the Grand Finals in the 2008-09, 2009‚Äì10, and 2010‚Äì11 seasons, serving as an elite perimeter defender for the team. Through the seasons, he also became an elite three point shooter, and is currently the 10th all-time CBA three-point leader. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, Shirelijan started 30 of the 45 regular season games he played, averaging 30.0 minutes per game. He also averaged 8.5 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.2 three pointers, 1.8 steals, and 1.7 assists per game. He played an important role in the first CBA championship for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers franchise. Before the 2018‚Äì19 season, Shirelijan was rented to Guangzhou Loong Lions for one year in a blockbuster trade. In the same trade, Xinjiang traded Yao Tianyi and rented Sun Mingyang for three years to Guangzhou, and Guangzhou rented Fan Ziming for two years to Xinjiang. Shirelijan returned to Xinjiang Flying Tigers after the one-year rental terminated. After the 2019‚Äì20 season, Shirelijan's contract with Xinjiang Flying Tigers terminated, and he became a free agent. He signed a three-year max (type-D) contract with Nanjing Monkey Kings, averaging 8 million CNY (US$1.2 million) a year. He is the most notable free-agent pick for Nanjing Monkey Kings in their first year of rebuild.  Name  There are several alternative spellings to his name. Shirelijan, or alternatively Xirelijan, is the direct transliteration of his first name from his naitve Uyghur language. Alternatively, some sources indirectly transliterated his name via Mandarin Chinese (Ë•øÁÉ≠ÂäõÊ±ü) as Xirelijiang. His patronym's direct translation from Uyghur is Muxtar, or alternatively, Muhtar. The indirect transliteration via Mandarin (Êú®ÂêàÂ°îÂ∞î) is Muhetaer. Therefore, alternative spellings of his full name include * Shirelijan Muxtar, * Xirelijan Muxtar, * Shirelijan Muhtar, * Xirelijan Muhtar, and * Xirelijiang Muhetaer. Some sources mistake his patronym's indirect transliteration via Mandarin as Mugedaer. Some sources also mistake his name as a Chinese name, thus treating his first name as the surname or applying the Eastern name order. As a Uyghur name, Shirelijan Muxtar uses the patronymic system and consists of the given (first) name Shirelijan and the patronym (father's name) Muxtar. Therefore, Muxtar is the name of Shirelijan's father. In general, it is not acceptable to refer to him using only Muxtar, even in a context which usually requires a surname (last name). One should always refer to him using the full name Shirelijan Muxtar or simply his first name Shirelijan.

She is best known for her work with the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican community activist group in the United States.  Early life and education  Iris Morales was born in New York in 1948 to Puerto Rican migrant parents. Her father worked as a hotel elevator operator, and her mother worked as a sewing machine operator. She went to Julia Richman High School, where she attended meetings of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the NAACP. As a teenager, she became a tenant rights organizer in her East Harlem neighborhood and protested the Vietnam War. She studied political science at City College, where she joined the Black student organization. She also co-founded Puerto Ricans Involved in Student Action (PRISA), the school's first Puerto Rican student organization.  The Young Lords  The Young Lords logo. The Chicago-based Young Lords, a leftist group of Puerto Rican youth activists inspired by the Black Panthers, established a branch in New York in 1969. Morales joined the group that year, after meeting Young Lords founder Jos√© Cha Cha Jim√©nez at a conference in Denver. Her work as a leader in the Young Lords spanned five years in the 1960s and 1970s. She served as deputy minister of education and co-founder of its Women's Caucus. She also served as minister of information for a period. Morales worked on political education and literacy efforts, as well as attempting to change the machista culture of the organization. She advocated for women's inclusion in leadership and helped co-found the Women's Union and its corresponding publication, La Luchadora. Her work on women's representation in the Young Lords paved the way for the organization's pioneering lesbian and gay caucus. In addition to her fight for the feminist cause within the Young Lords, she also used her position in the organization to advocate for abortion access and against forced sterilizations. Among the causes that the organization undertook during this period included establishing a free breakfast program for New York's youth, creating a lead poisoning prevention program, founding a daycare so Latina women could seek employment, and advocating for decolonization of Puerto Rico. Morales resigned from the Young Lords, which was struggling with infighting and targeted by the FBI's COINTELPRO program, in 1975. The party effectively disbanded the following year.  Further education and career  After the dissolution of the Young Lords, Morales continued her Latina feminist activism and pursued a law degree from New York University School of Law. At NYU, she became the first Puerto Rican to receive the highly competitive Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship, a full-tuition public service scholarship. As a lawyer, she worked as an attorney and director of education at the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. She was also a co-founder and the executive director of the New Educational Opportunities Network, a media nonprofit serving young people of color. She later worked with Manhattan Neighborhood Network's community media center in Spanish Harlem and served as director of the Union Square Awards, a city government project recognizing grassroots activists. Morales returned to school again and earned an MFA in Integrated Media Arts from Hunter College. She subsequently founded Latino Education Network Services, a documentary filmmaking nonprofit. In 2020, she was honored as a Latina Trailblazer by LatinoJustice PRLDEF. The cover of Through the Eyes of Rebel Women. = Writing and documentary film = With the founding of Latino Education Network Services, Morales created her first film, the 1996 documentary ¬°Palante Siempre Palante! The Young Lords. The documentary aired as part of the PBS series POV. Morales has contributed to recent scholarship on the history of the Young Lords, writing forwards for The Young Lords: A Reader in 2010 and Palante: Young Lords Party in 2011. In 2012, Morales founded her own small publishing house, Red Sugarcane Press. In 2016, the press published her history of women in the Young Lords, Through the Eyes of Rebel Women: The Young Lords 1969-1976. Red Sugarcane subsequently published the anthology Latinas: Struggles and Protests in 21st Century USA, edited by Morales, in 2018. She also edited the 2019 bilingual anthology Voices from Puerto Rico: Post-Hurricane Maria, in which Puerto Rican activists discuss the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

He served as president of the Hatters' Association for eight years. He later established a liquor saloon on 74 Stanton Street. During the Lexow Committee, it was revealed that a brothel keeper was renting the building from him and he had corrupt ties with the police. In 1887, Wissig was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Democrat, representing the New York County 8th District. He served in the Assembly in 1888, 1890, and 1892. In the 1892 session, when the Assembly was voting for women's suffrage, Wissig spoke against it so vehemently and vulgarly, the Assembly quickly voted to expunge all record of the speech. The suffrage bill passed the Assembly 69-34, partially as a reaction to Wissig's speech. In response to the speech, Tammany Hall forced him to retire from his Tammany leadership position.

He has held a number of artist in residence positions and his work can be seen in public spaces throughout New Zealand. His artworks are often constructed from recycled or repurposed items such as gorse bushes and road safety barriers.  Education  Gentry graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Otago Polytechnic School of Art in 2000 although some sources state that his degree was from Otago University.  Career highlights  An early career piece was Foot in the Door, which has become an ongoing project to document the installation of a foot long ruler into the door of galleries across New Zealand. As the number of galleries that have allowed the artist to put ‚Äòa foot in the door‚Äô increases, so has the artist's reputation. As the William Hodges Fellowship artist in residence in 2006 he produced a major body of work, Of gorse of course consisting of a series of artefacts constructed from wood obtained from gorse which has become a major invasive plant species in New Zealand. By crafting articles from gorse, the artist's intention was to draw a contrast with the poor reputation enjoyed by gorse. This work was subsequently exhibited at the Dowse Art Museum and is now owned by Connells Bay Sculpture Trust. Gentry was the inaugural winner of Wellington Sculpture Trust's 4 Plinths Award. His installation Green Islands consisted of four trees constructed from No. 8 fencing wire. These stark leafless representations of the natural world provided an ironic commentary on the urban environment in which they were placed. In January 2010, the installation was relocated to the Wellington Botanic Garden.

Opened in 1847, it was a stop for Providence‚ÄìWorcester service until 1960, and Boston commuter service until 1966. History The Providence and Worcester Railroad (P&W;) opened on the alignment of the former Blackstone Canal in October 1847. The Norfolk County Railroad opened from Blackstone to (with a connection to Boston via the Dedham Branch) on April 23, 1849. In 1850, the Boston and New York Central Railroad (B&NYC;) completed the Southbridge and Blackstone Railroad between Blackstone and Mechanicsville, Connecticut on the Norwich and Worcester Railroad. That line was infrequently operated until 1867, when the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad (BH&E;) consolidated the Norfolk County and B&NYC; into a single through line. The BH&E; built the Blackstone Viaduct just to the east in 1872, replacing a wooden trestle and an embankment, as part of an improvement program. The railroad completed the Air Line in 1873, placing Blackstone on a New York‚ÄìBoston through route. The extension was costly, and the BH&E; came out of bankruptcy in 1875 as the New York and New England Railroad (NY&NE;). The P&W; was leased by the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad in 1892, and in turn by the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad in 1895. The NY&NE; was under control of the New Haven by 1895, and was leased in 1899 as its Midland Division. alt=A stone embankment with a boarded-up staircase in the middle Except for a short period in the 1870s, Blackstone generally did not have schedules suitable for Boston commuting. By the turn of the century, it was served by three daily Boston‚ÄìHartford round trips and 7‚Äì8 Providence‚ÄìWorcester round trips. Some commuter service was extended to Blackstone in the 1930s, but this was reduced to two Blackstone‚ÄìBoston round trips plus a Boston‚ÄìHartford round trip in 1940. A second long-distance train on the route stopping at Blackstone was added during World War II. Providence‚ÄìWorcester service via Blackstone was reduced to one daily round trip by 1935, briefly increased to four in 1953, then reverted to one until discontinued in 1960. Boston commuter service was increased to six daily round trips in 1952, but service west of Blackstone ended in 1955 after rains from Hurricane Diane washed out a bridge near Putnam, Connecticut. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was formed in August 1964 to subsidize Boston commuter service. The MBTA began subsidizing service as far as on April 24, 1966. Franklin agreed to subsidize its service, but Blackstone did not, so service was cut back to Franklin. After the collapse of the Blackstone River bridge to the east in 1968, New Haven successor Penn Central was allowed to abandon the Midland Division between Putnam, Connecticut and Franklin in 1969. Most of that section, except the Blackstone Viaduct, has been converted to the Southern New England Trunkline Trail, with the former Blackstone station site as a parking lot. The P&W; became independent from Penn Central in 1973 and continues to operate freight service.

History The house was completed in 1860 for wealthy cotton planter and slave owner John Williams Boddie who died at the end of the American Civil War. In 1869 the 500-acre former plantation, including the house, was bought for $10,500 by the Freedmen's Bureau and the American Missionary Association to become the campus of a school for Black students who were recently freed from slavery. NRIS Initially the building was used for a day school and then for housing female students in the upstairs bedrooms. Later it was used as a faculty dorm and for the college president's office. The building was renamed after college trustee Robert O. Wilder to better reflect the school's mission as a historically black college by distancing itself from a slave owner. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and later became a contributing property to the Tougaloo College Historic District in 1998.NRIS The building underwent structural renovations in 2003 and the exterior was refinished in 2012. The interior was renovated in 2020. The rebuilding project funds came from a combination of state and federal grants.

History The creation of General Sarmiento Partido was promulgated on 18 October 1889 by Provincial Law No. 2,198, comprising the towns of San Miguel, Bella Vista and territories of the partidos of Pilar and Las Conchas (now Tigre). In 1994 Provincial Law No. 11,551 / 94.4 was enacted, through which it was decided to legally dissolve the General Sarmiento Partido and create the Jos√© C. Paz, Malvinas Argentinas and San Miguel Partidos in its territory until then. As the second of the new administrative jurisdictions also received a small portion (of only 3 km2) from the partido of Pilar, as compensation for this loss, the entire town of Del Viso was incorporated into the jurisdiction of the latter. General Sarmiento officially ceased to exist on 10 December 1995, the day the municipal activities of the three new parties began to function. However, the National University of General Sarmiento (UNGS), which for its part was founded in 1992 and whose main headquarters became located in the Malvinas Argentinas Partido, continues to maintain its old name. =Population= Its population, which was already 502,926 inhabitants according to the census at the end of 1980 (having at that time implied a density of 2,566 inhabitants/km2), in 1991 (the last in which the party still existed) was 652,969 hab. (3,331 inhab./km2). Then this last figure would be finally lowered to 638,486 inhabitants, due to the post-census territorial readjustment. For their part, the three partidos into which it was divided had a combined population of 743,585 inhabitants. (3,853 inhabitants/km2) according to the 2001 census and 864,546 inhabitants.

Mar√≠a Trinidad del Cid (May 20, 1899 ‚Äì November 19, 1966) was a Honduran writer, journalist, and feminist activist. She is considered a foundational figure in the fight for women's rights in Honduras.  Biography  Mar√≠a Trinidad del Cid was born in Magdalena, Intibuc√°, Honduras, in 1899. She completed her primary studies in both Honduras and El Salvador, due to Magdalena's proximity to the border. At age 16, in 1915, she began studying to be a schoolteacher at the Girls' Normal School of Comayag√ºela. After graduating in 1922, she began contributing to various publications as a journalist, including La Tribuna, El Amigo del Hogar, Vida, Regeneraci√≥n, Antorcha, Vida Rotaria, and Revista del Archivo y Biblioteca Nacionales. She also continued her involvement in education, representing Honduras in the First Central American Education Conference, held in Costa Rica in 1928. Trinidad del Cid served as spokesperson for the Society of Geography and History of Honduras, which was founded in 1934. She was also a member of the Honduran Institute of Inter-American Culture, the Pan-American Roundtable, the Zelaya Sierra Group, the National Magesterium, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. A proponent of pan-Americanism, she also represented Honduras at the Inter-American History Congress in New Orleans in 1947 and at the Pan-American Union. She fought for Honduran and Latin American women's political rights, founding the Honduran Women's Committee in 1947 and serving as the organization's first president. The committee swiftly affiliated with the Inter-American Commission of Women, which Trinidad del Cid participated in as a representative of Honduras. That same year, in 1947, Trinidad del Cid founded the magazine Mujer Americana, which was affiliated with the Honduran Women's Committee and promoted women's suffrage among other causes. In 1949, she led the committee in launching \\"The Women's Hour\\" on the radio station HRN La Voz de Honduras, the country's major radio station at the time. In addition to her journalistic work and feminist essays, Trinidad del Cid also wrote poetry, including an ode to the former Honduran political leader Francisco Moraz√°n. In 1944 she published her first book, La vida ejemplar de do√±a Guadalupe Reyes de Car√≠as. The work discusses the Car√≠as Reyes family and contains other essays. She also wrote the novel Los H√©roes in 1955. Trinidad del Cid continued to be involved in teaching civics and moral education into her final years. She died in Tegucigalpa in 1966.

DeFi is promoted as offering high interest rates, with some providers offering triple-digit interest rates, but is subject to high risk. Inexperienced investors are at particular risk. History In July 2020, The Washington Post did a primer on decentralized finance (DeFi) including details on what yield farming is, returns on investments, and risks involved. In September 2020, Bloomberg said that DeFi made up two-thirds of the cryptocurrency market in terms of price changes and that DeFi collateral levels reached $9 billion. How DeFi works Rather than trading being done at a centralised cryptocurrency exchange, trades are directly between participants, mediated by smart contract programs. The \\"decentralization\\" is the lack of a central exchange ‚Äì the smart contract programs for the DeFi protocols themselves are run using open source software by a community of developers and programmers. Stablecoin holders commit assets to a liquidity pool. Borrowers can lend from this, by putting up more collateral than the amount of the loan. Interest depends on the moment-to-moment demand for the asset. As of August 2020, $3.7 billion of crypto-assets were committed in this manner; as of September 2020, the total was $7.8 billion. DeFi has attracted large cryptocurrency venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures and Michael Novogratz. Risks of DeFi Transactions are irreversible. Coding errors, and hacks, are common. Smart contract programs are easily copied. The entity running a DeFi protocol may be unknown, and may disappear with investors' money. Novogratz has described some DeFi protocols as \\"ponzi-like.\\" DeFi is largely non-compliant with Know Your Customer and other anti-money laundering rules.

The company was founded in 1725 in Udine, a small town in northern Italy. Initially, the company specialized in clocks for towers. It began working with designer Gino Valle after World War II, and developed signs with four flaps, each with ten digits, to display the time. The company eventually designed displays with 40 flaps, with the help of Belgian inventor John Myer. The new displays could include numbers and letters, allowing for a much wider use. The company's split-flap displays, commonly with white numbers on black flaps, won the Compasso d'Oro award in 1956. In this year, Solari sold its first moving sign to Liege railway station in Belgium. It subsequently sold thousands to airports and train stations. There is no known record of surviving Solari split-flap displays, though hundreds have been replaced with more modern displays across the world.

Congdon was a native of Onondaga County, New York, and lived for most of her life in the town of Amber. One of five siblings, early in her childhood her father died, and the family was left with little money. Caroline was educated at home and in the local district school, and early displayed a taste for intellectual pursuits, but she suffered from chronic poor health, including a fever and paralysis which left her bedridden at the age of fourteen. Left only with the use of her hand, she began to write poetry, using a pencil and a specially-made upside- down table which held the paper in place over her head and chest. In this manner she produced enough poems to fill a volume, The Guardian Angel, which was published in 1856 and which featured as a frontspiece a portrait of Congdon in her bed. The poems range from shorter works on a variety of topics to long, narrative pieces on romantic subjects; the book also contains a poem on an abolitionist subject. In the preface she asked \\"the Critic to spare my little book, and the tender-hearted Reader to drop a tear of sympathy for its afflicted Authoress\\"; she died four years after the book's publication.

By the turn of the twentieth century, another economic boom brought a large retail district to downtown Peoria; many of the department stores from this period still stand in the district. An urban renewal project in the mid-twentieth century brought several Modernist skyscrapers to downtown Peoria as well, including the Caterpillar administration building, the DeKroff Metz and Company Building, and the First Federal Savings Tower. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 2018.

S√¶ther was born in B√¶rums Verk, Norway. In 1944 he married Ellen Ekelund, with whom he had three daughters. S√¶ther studied violin with √òivin Fjeldstad. He played as a violinist with the Oslo Philharmonic from 1945 to 1985. S√¶ther debuted as a soloist at the University Hall () in Oslo in 1946 accompanied by Robert Levin. Kaare S√¶ther died in Harestua, Norway. He and his wife Ellen S√¶ther are buried at Grua Church. Orchestral career As a student of √òivin Fjeldstad, S√¶ther played in Fjeldstad's chamber orchestra, later the Youth Chamber Orchestra (), and he began to play early in his career with the Philharmonic Society Orchestra, as the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra was then called. After he married, to support his family he became involved in the orchestra at the German Theater () at Stortingsgata 16. In the summer of 1945, he auditioned for a vacant position in the philharmonic, where he was placed in first chair in the second violin group next to the German violinist Walter Werner. S√¶ther led the second violin group for over 35 years, sharing first chair in alternation with Walter Werner, Bj√∏rn Woll, Borghild Nygaard, Peter Hindar, Noralf Glein, and K√•re Fuglesang. For the last three seasons, from 1982 to 1985, he occupied second chair in the group and performed together with four former students in the first chair in both violin groups: Terje T√∏nnesen, John Arne Hirding, J√∏rn Halbakken, and Frode Hoff. S√¶ther was a talented orchestral musician that could play everything placed on the music stand in front of him prima vista, regardless of difficulty. His musical memory was remarkable, and he was able to explain in detail the interpretations and technical solutions of both conductors and guest soloists during the forty years he worked in the orchestra. As the \\"orchestra's memory,\\" he was a valuable source of knowledge about the philharmonic's inner workings and staff history. Via his teacher √òivin Fjeldstad‚Äîand his teacher Gustav Fredrik Lange‚Äîhe could trace the Norwegian orchestral tradition back to the time of Iver Holter, Johan Halvorsen, and Johan Svendsen. Little of S√¶ther's knowledge about this tradition was written down or preserved for posterity. As soloist Over the years, S√¶ther played many solo programs on NRK, where he premiered new Norwegian music and gave first-time performances in Norway of music by many foreign composers. He was the first Norwegian to played Alban Berg's Violin Concerto with the philharmonic, and as a soloist with the philharmonic in the Oslo Concert Hall he performed Klaus Egge's Concerto for Violin and Orchestra, which was also broadcast on radio. S√¶ther also played Igor Stravinsky's Violin Concerto in D with the philharmonic on NRK. S√¶ther and Bjarne Larsen received good reviews for a sweepingly beautiful performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra in D Minor. He also performed the great classical violin concertos by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Bruch, Brahms, and Tchaikovsky. He performed these enthusiastically together with good amateur orchestras in Eastern Norway. Among Norwegian works, he premiered Leif Solberg's violin sonata on NRK Radio with Ebba Isene at the piano. Violin teacher In 1959, the Veitvet Music School was established at Olav Selvaag's initiative and financed by him. The music school quickly developed into a vocational music school and conservatory, and Kaare S√¶ther was engaged by the conservatory as a violin teacher. For 28 years until his sudden death in February 1987, he was a valued educator first at Veitvet, and later at the school's locations in the Godlia neighborhood in Oslo's √òstensj√∏ borough. For a number of years, he and his colleague Leif J√∏rgensen contributed to making the Eastern Norway Conservatory of Music a vital and competitive supplement to the Norwegian Academy of Music for string instruments. S√¶ther taught solo performance and also conducted the conservatory's orchestra for many years with enthusiasm and extensive knowledge of the repertoire. Among his hundreds of students, many have had a strong presence in Norwegian music life. The philharmonic's first concertmaster Terje T√∏nnesen, second concertmaster John Arne Hirding, and violinists J√∏rn Halbakken, Frode Hoff, Tove Halbakken Resell, Lise Strandli, Hans Morten Stensland, and Vegard Johnsen all studied under S√¶ther. The Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, Trondheim Symphony Orchestra, Stavanger Symphony Orchestra, Norwegian Radio Orchestra, and Norwegian National Opera and Ballet Orchestra also have musicians that studied under S√¶ther in their string sections. The composer and violinist Ole Henrik Moe studied violin with S√¶ther. Other prominent students of S√¶ther include Erik Fossum Svendsen, John Westbye, and √òivind Nussle. The violinist and ensemble leader Olaf Aasen is also a S√¶ther student.

The museum is devoted to the exhibition and preservation of the Armenian poet Hovhannes Shiraz's personal belongings, manuscripts and works. The building was built in 1886, with red tuff stone of the Shirak province, and was the home of a wealthy merchant named Qeshishyan. During most of the Soviet period, it was used as a storehouse. In July 1983, not wanting to wait until Shiraz's death to honour him, government officials offered Shiraz a home to live in. However, the poet only lived in this house for a year, as he soon passed away in March 1984. In order to preserve his legacy, the building later became a house- museum by the resolution of the Government of Armenia. Due to the 1988 Armenian earthquake, the museum‚Äôs refurbishment was interrupted, and 8 homeless families found shelter in the house. The USAID Housing Purchase Certificate Program assisted to relocate displaced families living in the house after the earthquake to permanent housing. This permitted the museum, in collaboration with the Government of Armenia and the City Hall of Gyumri, to restore the public space as a house-museum. Today, the western facade has a luxurious gate that leads to a large courtyard. The museum consists of six rooms. The first presents information about the poet's childhood. The second room is furnished as it was during Shiraz's lifetime. The other four rooms house the author's creative works, paintings, sculptures, etc. On display is a painting by the American author, John Steinbeck, thanking Shiraz for his hospitality in Yerevan. The House-Museum is located on 101 Varpetats Street, Gyumri 3104, Armenia.

The case is an important decision in Australian refugee law. According to LawCite, Chen has been cited the third most times of any High Court decision.Note: LawCite citation statistics track the written judgements of courts, journal articles, and tribunals.

His parents were in breach of China's 'one child policy', as they had already had two other children, Chen's siblings; on the mainland. Chen's brother was with him in the centre, but his sister was in China at the time. The parents had been refused protection in Australia by the Department of Immigration. Chen's father sought a refugee visa on his behalf, arguing that as he was a 'black child' under the one child policy, he would suffer persecution if returned to China. The application for a protection visa was refused. This decision was affirmed by the RRT. The Tribunal found that: > (the appellant) 'faces a real chance of persecution ... because of (in a > strict causative sense) his membership of a particular social group' but not > for reasons of his membership of [that] group'. That was because the > consequences which the appellant would be likely to suffer in China would > not 'result from any malignity, enmity or other adverse intention towards > him on the part of the [Chinese] authorities'. Rather, in the Tribunal's > view, it would result from their intention 'to penalize those who have > children outside the approved guidelines' 201 CLR 293, at [7] Chen's father then sought judicial review on his behalf. At first instance, French J found that Chen was entitled to refugee protection, and on that basis remitted the decision to the Tribunal. The Minister appealed, and won at the Full Federal Court. The majority (O'Loughlin and Carr JJ, R D Nicholson J dissenting) found that the adverse treatment likely to befall Chen was not by reason of him being a member of a social group of 'black children'. Rather, they held; it was because of his parents conduct in contravening the relevant laws of China'.201 CLR 293, at [10] They further found that more generally, 'black children' as a group were not a relevant social group capable of securing protection under the Refugee convention. Chen's father then arranged an appeal to the High Court.  Judgement  The High Court upheld Chen's appeal, finding that he was entitled to refugee protection. They found that he was a 'black child' under China's one child policy, and as such; was a member of a 'particular social group' for the purposes of the Refugee Convention. They adopted the Tribunal's finding that persecution would be suffered by Chen upon return; and that a 'well founded fear' existed, as his parent's held those fears on his behalf. In making its decision, the court distinguished Chen from the case Applicant A v MIEA; a case which had found persons who feared enforced sterilization for opposing China's one-child policy, did not constitute a 'particular social group' under the convention.201 CLR 293, at [20] The distinction drawn by the High Court derived from an observation that Chen did not contravene the policy, rather, he was born in contravention of it. The High Court then discussed the meaning of 'persecution' under the convention, saying:201 CLR 293, at [28] - [30] > ... the question whether the different treatment of persons of a particular > race, religion, nationality or political persuasion or who are members of a > particular social group constitutes persecution for that reason ultimately > depends on whether that treatment is \\"appropriate and adapted to achieving > some legitimate object of the country [concerned]\\". Moreover, it is \\"[o]nly > in exceptional cases ... that a sanction aimed at persons for reasons of > race, religion or nationality will be an appropriate means for achieving > [some] legitimate government object and not amount to persecution Whether > the different treatment of different individuals or groups is appropriate > and adapted to achieving some legitimate government object depends on the > different treatment involved and, ultimately, whether it offends the > standards of civil societies which seek to meet the calls of common > humanity. Ordinarily, denial of access to food, shelter, medical treatment > and, in the case of children, denial of an opportunity to obtain an > education involve such a significant departure from the standards of the > civilized world as to constitute persecution. And that is so even if the > different treatment involved is undertaken for the purpose of achieving some > legitimate national objective. The fact that \\"black children\\" are treated > differently in China in consequence of the \\"one-child policy\\", which is a > policy of general application, is relevant to the question whether that > treatment amounts to persecution. But if the conduct in question does amount > to persecution, that consideration cannot then result in the conclusion that > that persecution is not for the reason that they are \\"black children\\". The High Court therefore overturned the lower court, making a finding that Chen was a member of a 'particular social group', in the convention sense.  Legal Significance  Chen is one of the High Court's most cited cases, particularly for its discussion of when laws of a general application might give rise to a refugee protection claim.https://jade.io/citation/2464108 It has also been cited for the proposition that 'motivation in the sense of intention to inflict harm, is not necessarily an element of the concept of persecution', and for its general comments about what the act requires.AATA 2915, Member Hawkins at Citation #2 It developed the jurisprudence of the meaning of the terms 'particular social group', and 'persecution' as relevant to refugee protection claims. As it is often included in the written reasons of Tribunal and Court decisions for refugee visa matters; it is one of the most cited High Court cases in Australia, ranking number three on LawCite.  Aftermath  Little public information is available about how Chen and his family fared after the High Court's decision. According to Dr Tania Penovic; Chen Shi Hai was detained from birth until he was five and a half; 28 days after his family members were issued with visas. As of 2003, Chen had been detained by the Australian government for a longer period of time than any other child. His total length of detention was 1,998 days.

The Treaty Oak was a 350-400 year old oak tree that once stood on the Oak Lawn estate in Washington, D.C. The estate, previously called Widow's Mite, was originally owned by the Holmead and Nourse families. It included a large four- story Second Empire house that had been expanded by owner Thomas P. Morgan. The estate was bounded by 19th Street, Columbia Road, Connecticut Avenue, and Florida Avenue, on the edge of today's Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan neighborhoods. The oak tree earned its nickname due to local legends that a treaty was signed there between early settlers and Native Americans. Despite massive development in the surrounding neighborhoods during the late 19th century and early 20th century, the estate remained a wooded area and was sought after by local developers. In 1922 a Masonic group purchased the estate for what was then a significant amount of money to build a massive complex that would include temples. The plans were never carried out and in 1940 the site was chosen for the large Crystal Heights mixed development designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. That plan was also abandoned. The tree remained until 1953 when it was felled for a planned parking lot. The land where the tree and house once stood is the site of the Washington Hilton, an apartment building, and two office buildings. At the time of its destruction, the Treat Oak was reportedly the largest oak tree in the Washington, D.C. area. Legends and history =Legends= The Treaty Oak was estimated to date from the mid-1600s to early-1700s. There are three unproven legends about the tree, two of which involve white settlers and members of the local Nacotchtank tribe. The area where the Treaty Oak once stood was originally part of a 600 acre (243 ha) tract of land known as Widow's Mite. The local legend behind the name Widow's Mite involves Manacasset, chief of the local Nacotchtank tribe, who allegedly lived beneath the tree due to its strategic view of the surrounding area. During a raid against local white settlers, Manacasset is said to have captured a woman named Magdalena Noyes and her infant daughter. After Magdalena refused his advances Manacasset sentenced her to live underneath the tree, never stepping outside of its shadow, or she would be killed. Magdalena named her daughter Gwawa, which meant \\"hope\\", and she lived underneath the tree for the rest of her life. As a child, Gwawa is said to have been mocked by other Nacotchtank children due to her pale complexion. There was one child though, a biracial Native American boy named Tschagarag, who befriended her. He taught Gwawa his native language and together they explored the local area. The two would eventually fall in love and marry. After Manacasset was killed in battle, Magdalena died soon thereafter. Although she was originally a prisoner confined to live by the tree, during her later years it was said Magdalena had grown to love the mighty oak. In her will she allegedly wrote: \\"I, Magdalena Noyes, bequeath to my daughter, Gwawa, and her husband Tschagarag, all my property, consisting of the 17.5 acres [7.1 ha] of land, the hut I live in and all therein. And if contentment the germ of happiness be transferable, may you receive it and enjoy it all through life. I also have a request which I beg of you fulfill: Regard the Oak that overspreads our dwelling as an ancient relic. Cherish it through life as the talisman of a resigned sufferer. Should you be blessed with offspring, instill them with reverence for the tree such as will transmit from generation to generation.\\" The second legend involves members of the Nacotchtank tribe and white settlers signing a treaty beneath the tree. One version of this story involves Magdalena acting as the interpreter between the two parties. The third legend is that George Washington wanted the Captiol erected on the site, but Magdalena would not agree to the idea. =Recorded history= Frank Lloyd Wright with his plans for Crystal Heights in 1940. When the City of Washington was laid out the land where the Treaty Oak stood was part of a 16 acre (6.5 ha) farm owned by settler Anthony Holmead. He sold the land in 1809 to Colonel Michael Nourse, who was chief clerk at the Treasury Department. Nourse built a Federal style house on the land, next to the oak tree. He later sold the property because at the time it was too far from downtown, resulting in a long commute to work. The property, which was then 10 acres (4 ha), was purchased in 1866 by politician Thomas P. Morgan. He renovated and expanded the home into a large Second Empire style house. He named his estate Oak Lawn due to the large oak tree on his property. As the years progressed the area around Oak Lawn developed into bustling residential and commercial neighborhoods, and due to the impressive views of the city from the estate, it was sought after by local developers. The following owner, the Dean family, sold Oak Lawn in 1922 to the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons for $900,000, a significant amount at the time. The Masons planned to build a large $3,000,000 complex on the site, which they renamed Temple Heights, that would include temples, an auditorium for 3,000 people, and a large tower. The multiyear fundraising campaign ended in 1929 when the stock market crashed. The tree and house remained untouched through the Great Depression. In 1940 developer Roy S. Thurman chose the site for his $12,000,000 mixed-use development that would include a large parking deck and 14 towers composed of a 2,500-room hotel, theater, apartments, and retail shops. Frank Lloyd Wright was selected to design the massive project, which he called Crystal Heights (later Crystal City). Due to lack of funding, local zoning laws including the Height of Buildings Act of 1899, and the outbreak of World War II, the project was cancelled. During the following years there were several plans for the site, including a park, war memorial, apartments and hotels, and large parking lot. The house was demolished in 1948 after plans were made to build a shopping center on the site. That plan was also abandoned and the Treaty Oak remained until March 13, 1953, when the property was cleared for yet another planned commercial development. At the time it was felled, a government expert estimated the tree was around 350 years old, but it was most often described as 400 years old. It was reportedly the largest oak tree in the Washington, D.C. area. Following numerous abandoned plans for the former Oak Lawn property, in the 1960s the Washington Hilton and two office buildings were built on the site. A luxury apartment building was also built there in 2016.

She is best known for her work illustrating the original The Joy of Cooking, which she co- authored with her mother, Irma von Starkloff Rombauer and continued to update after her mother's death.  Life  Marion Rombauer was born in St. Louis in 1903. She attended Vassar College, graduating in 1925 with degrees in art history and French. She was interested in art, and served as the art director at John Burroughs School from 1928 to 1932. Following the death of her father by suicide in 1930, she moved into an apartment with her mother, where they personally tested out the recipes for the cookbook. Marion designed the book, cover art, and illustrations for the first edition of The Joy of Cooking. In 1932, Marion married an architect named John William Becker and began working as art director at the Hillsdale School in Cincinnati. She went on to serve as the first professional director of the Modern Art Society of Cincinnati (now known as Contemporary Arts Center) from 1942 to 1947. In 1955 Becker was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. Becker was passionate about gardening and botany, and co-authored a book about wild plants and flowers called Wild Wealth with ecologist Paul Sears and Frances Jones Poetker in 1971.

History  The automotive company Bollinger Motors was founded as a startup in 2014 in New York City by the American entrepreneur Robert Bollinger, taking its name from his name. The aim was to develop a full-size electric off-road vehicle. The first result of the work of Bollinger's designers was a prototype of a three-door car called the B1, which was presented in June 2017. The car has a characteristic, austere design distinguished by an angular body covered with matt varnish and the possibility of disassembling the rear part of the roof. The market launch of the model was then scheduled for 2019. By August 2017, the manufacturer managed to collect 6,000 orders for the Bollinger B1. In March 2018, the Bollinger decided to move the headquarters from New York City to Ferndale, Michigan. Two years after the presentation of the B1 prototype, in September, Bollinger presented its first two cars ready for production - the production variant of the B1 model underwent cosmetic changes in the exterior and became longer with an additional rear door and a large 4-door B2 pickup. In April 2020, Bollinger announced that serial production and sales of both B1 and B2 models presented in the fall of the previous year will start in 2021.

Diana Raznovich (born 1945) in an Argentine playwright and cartoonist. Her work in both mediums is comedic in tone and deals with feminism, sexuality, and Argentina's military dictatorship.  Early life and education  Diana Raznovich was born in Buenos Aires in 1945, the oldest of three children. Her grandparents were European Jewish immigrants to the country from the Russian Empire and Vienna. She studied literature at the University of Buenos Aires, where she was chosen as one of the students who would read to professor Jorge Luis Borges, who had gone blind by that time.  Career  = Theater = Raznovich's first play, Buscapi√©s, won a theater contest in 1967, jumpstarting her career when she was only 22 years old. After she wrote several more plays in the late 1960s and early 1970s, her career was disrupted by political violence and repression. Her husband Ernesto Clusellas was disappeared in 1974 during the escalating political persecution ahead of Argentina's Dirty War. He had been actively involved in the resistance movement and, unbeknownst to Raznovich, had stored an armory of weapons in their apartment. Raznovich self-exiled the following year amid threats from the armed forces. She settled in Spain, where she taught playwriting at the Centro de Estudios Teatrales in Madrid and continued to write her own plays. In 1981, she visited Argentina from exile to participate in the Teatro Abierto festival, a grouping of one-act plays in defiance of the military dictatorship's restrictions on expression. The military burned down the theater hosting the festival the night her play, Desconcierto, was presented. She returned to Argentina after the fall of the dictatorship in 1983, but she moved back to Spain from 1988 until 1993. She then settled again in Argentina until 2000, when she returned once again to Spain. Her plays were performed in various languages on both sides of the Atlantic throughout this period, notably Jardin de oto√±o (1983), Casa Matriz (1991), De atr√°s para adelante (1993), and De la cintura para abajo (1999). In 1992, Raznovich received a Guggenheim Fellowship to continue her work as a playwright.\\"Archived copy\\". Archived from the original on 2011-06-22. Retrieved 2010-04-27. In 2002, she published a bilingual collection of four of her plays, titled Defiant Acts/Actos Desafiantes. = Cartoons = Raznovich is also a cartoonist. Her early humorous illustrations were tied to her involvement in the Argentine feminist movement, as she contributed cartoons to the women's and LGBT rights-centered magazine Alfonsina in the 1980s. Her cartooning is based in the concept that women's humor is inherently political, as explained in her \\"Manifesto 2000 of Feminine Humor,\\" and she has tackled such serious subjects as gender-based violence. Since 2012 she has published the cartoon Donatela on the back page of the Argentine newspaper Clar√≠n. She has also published collections of her cartoons, including Mujeres pluscuamperfectas in 2010 and Divinas y Chamuscadas in 2011. = Other work = Raznovich has also written poetry and novels, including Para que se cumplan todos tus deseos in 1989, though she primarily works in plays. She also worked as a screenwriter for the telenovela B√°rbara Narv√°ez in the 1980s.  Personal life  Raznovich's first husband, Ernesto Clusellas, disappeared like so many others during the Dirty War. She later learned that he had been assassinated in 1978. She subsequently married the theater director Hugo Urquijo, who directed her plays Desconcierto and Jard√≠n de oto√±o, but the couple divorced in 1983. Raznovich is bisexual, and much of her work deals with gender and sexuality. Some of her work is also informed by her Jewish heritage, and she has studied Kabbalah as an adult.

The Marxist analysis and takes as an area of discourse it has commonly considered the industrialization and mass-production of culture by 'the Culture Industry' as having an overall negative effect on society, an effect which reifies the audience away from developing a more authentic sense of human values. The original theory behind this from of analysis is commonly associated with the Frankfurt School, and specifically the works of Marcuse, and with Gramsci. In terms of positive engagement of Marxist dialect to driving change in cultural norms, which is to say Marxism applied to cultural goals, cultural engagement is seen as applying Marx's concept of class war to the field of alleged power relationships between cultural groups in society in a struggle for cultural hegemony, known as social conflict theory. Development of theory =Gramsci= Antonio Gramsci was an Italian Marxist philosopher, primarily writing in the lead up to and after the First World War. He attempted to break from the economic determinism of traditional Marxist thought and so is considered a key neo-Marxist. Gramsci is best known for his theory of cultural hegemony, which describes how the state and ruling capitalist class ‚Äî the bourgeoisie ‚Äî use cultural institutions to maintain power in capitalist societies. The bourgeoisie, in Gramsci's view, develops a hegemonic culture using ideology rather than violence, economic force, or coercion. Hegemonic culture propagates its own values and norms so that they become the ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù values of all and thus maintain the status quo. Hegemonic power, he asserted, is used to maintain consent to the capitalist order, rather than coercive power using force to maintain order, and that this cultural hegemony is produced and reproduced by the dominant class through the institutions that form the superstructure. =The Birmingham School= E.P. Thompson's Marxist humanism as well as the individual philosophies of the founders of The Birmingham School (Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall) provide the influences for their \\"British Cultural Marxism\\" (also known as British Cultural Studies) as housed at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham. The Birmingham School of Cultural Studies developed later than the Frankfurt School and are seen as providing a parallel response. Accordingly \\"British Cultural Marxism\\" focuses on later issues such as Globalization, Americanization, Censorship, and Multiculturalism. Richard Hoggart's The Uses of Literacy (1957), Raymond William's Culture and Society (1958) and E.P. Thompson's The Making of the English Working class (1964) form the foundational texts for the school, with Stuart Hall's Encoding/decoding model of communication as well as his writings on multiculturalism in Britain arriving later but carrying equal gravitas. The Birmingham School greatly valued and contributed to class consciousness within the structure of British society. Due to their positions as literary experts, Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams were called as witnesses during The Lady Chatterley Affair, a court case concerning censorship in publishing, the outcome of which is widely regarded as defining Britain in the 1960s as a \\"Permissive society\\". They argued on the side of freedom of language, and against censorship. Within Hoggart's major work, The Uses of Literacy, he laments the loss of an authentic working class popular culture in Britain, and denounces the imposition of a mass culture by means of advertising, media and Americanisation. He argues against the concept of 'the masses' which he claims is both condescending and elitist. Later referring to this change in cultural production as \\"massification\\" and saying it 'colonized local communities and robbed them of their distinctive features' Whereas the Frankfurt School exhorted the values of high culture, The Birmingham School have attempted to bring high culture back down to real life whilst avoiding moral relativism. Cultural Marxism The application of Marxist ideas in the cultural field is characterised as Cultural Marxism, which has become a disputed term. The concept of Cultural Marxism has been used with two contrasting meanings: *The redirection of Marx's concept of permanent class war into a struggle between identity groups in accordance with Marxist cultural analysis;'Cultural Marxism and Its Conspirators': Paul Pengor in American Spectator 3 April 2019 or *A conspiracy theory alleging ongoing influence of the Frankfurt School. =Marxism applied to cultural goals= The term \\"Cultural Marxism\\" first appeared in Trent Schroyer's 1973 book The Critique of Domination, and has most commonly been applied to trends in analysis developed in the Frankfurt and Birmingham schools of Cultural studies. Rather than being its own category of Soviet or Orthodox Marxism;- \\"Cultural Marxism\\", within Cultural Studies, is seen as an attempt at finding a form of Post-marxist Cultural Analysis which extends beyond the traditional base and superstructure model. It has been suggested by Frederic Jameson that Cultural Studies be redefined as Cultural Marxism as both seek to interrogate the unexamined ideological constraints placed on Cultural Production under capitalism, and to question their implications for society as a whole. In this sense, Cultural Marxism views The Culture Industry as creating a type of false consciousness. As a form of media literacy \\"Cultural Marxism\\" seeks to critique ideology itself. Within more recent history Cultural Marxists have critiqued post modernism and identity politics (also known as recognition politics), claiming that redistributive politics should retain prominence within their discourse.Zubatov, Alexander: 'Just Because Anti-Semites Talk About ‚ÄòCultural Marxism‚Äô Doesn‚Äôt Mean It Isn‚Äôt Real': in Tablet Magazine November 29, 2018 Prominent in the construction of a oppressor-oppressed narrative analysis of culture is the concept of intersectionality, drawing various aspects of perceived identity in terms of modes of discrimination and privilege. In modern political parlance, Cultural Conservatives have identified Cultural Marxism as the theoretical basis for aspects of cultural liberalism. The hyperbole and misinterpretation involved in this 'Culture War' has led to Cultural Marxism given rise, outside philosophical circles, to a conspiracy theory.Cudlipp Lecture, 22 January 2007: Paul Dacre =Conspiracy theory= As the theme of a conspiracy theory, Cultural Marxism is alleged to be a conspiracy in which the Frankfurt School is part of a continual academic and intellectual culture war systematically to undermine and destroy Western culture and social traditions. As articulated in the 1990s, the conspiracy means to replace traditionalist conservatism and Christianity with the counterculture of the 1960s to promote social changes such as racial multiculturalism, multi-party progressive politics and political correctness in language.Stuart Jeffries, Grand Hotel Abyss, pp.6-11 , Verso 2016 In Norway, Anders Behring Breivik quoted Lind's usages of Cultural Marxism in his political manifesto 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, which he emailed to 77 people just 90 minutes before killing 77 people in his bomb and gun attacks in Oslo and on Ut√∏ya.

The unusual circumstances of Italy‚Äôs entry into the war meant that the government played no active role in propaganda work during the early years of the war. Public opinion was served by a pro-war nationalist press that avoided the unpleasant details of life in the front, while the army regarded discipline as more important than morale, leaving soldiers‚Äô welfare to the Church. The momentous Italian defeat at Caporetto saw an end to this laissez- faire approach and the beginnings of a more centralised and managed effort to motivate the public and the army to the national cause. Pro-war propaganda to May 1915 1917 poster promoting war loans, Banca Italiana di Sconto In the UK, France, Germany and Austria-Hungary, propaganda was mainly a centrally- managed effort by the government and the armed forces from the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914. Italy did not enter the war until May 1915, and before this there was no organised state propaganda relating to the war. Instead, business interests and the press themselves took the lead. Between the end of 1914 and 1915 there was a sustained campaign in the Italian press for the country to enter the war. There were strong views in favour of intervention among the leading economic, industrial and financial interests, particularly those linked to heavy industry and war production, such as Ansaldo and Fiat, who financed Benito Mussolini‚Äôs pro-war paper Avanti! and the Banca Italiana di Sconto. These financed the press to urge the government to enter the war alongside the Entente. Most intellectuals were in favor of entering the war and many actively argued for it. The culmination of this campaign was Radiosomaggismo. In fact the majority of the Italian people did not support entering the war, but the government of Antonio Salandra made little attempt to involve parliament in the decision. It was widely expected that the war would be short and produce substantial territorial gains for Italy, so there appeared to be little need for an organised propaganda effort. Government and private initiatives after May 1915 Once war was declared, it was considered unnecessary to make the case for war beyond irredentism and \\" sacred selfishness‚Äù. It was generally believed that the conflict would be short, and the conservative leaders Antonio Salandra and Sidney Sonnino did not consider public opinion or support for the war to be essential. For these reasons government involvement in propaganda activities remained sporadic. It was not until the government of Paolo Boselli in 1916 that some form of ministerial responsibility for propaganda was first established. Two ministries without portfolio were created; one was for propaganda under :it:Vittorio Scialoja who in 1915 had founded the Unione Generale degli Insegnanti d‚ÄôItalia (\\"General Union of Italian Teachers\\") aimed at involving teachers in promoting the mobilisation of society on the home front. The other was for civil assistance, under :it:Ubaldo Comandini. From July 1917 Comandini was in charge of internal propaganda, and from February 1918, of the new Commissariato Generale per l'Assistenza Civile e la Propaganda Interna (General Commission for Civil Assistance and Internal Propaganda). An album of patriotic songs for the piano, July 1915 Numerous private associations made up for the lack of state-directed propaganda and took on the burden of civil assistance; some of them arose in the early months of 1915 with the aim of national education and assistance to the working classes most affected by the mobilization. As the war went on they became more numerous, and many of these were brought together in the summer of 1917 in the Opere Federate di Assistenza e Propaganda Nazionale (Federation of National Assistance and Propaganda Organizations), directed by Comandini himself. This was a single private body, made up of 80 provincial secretaries and 4,500 commissioners, and it became the main organization used by the government for assistance and patriotic propaganda directed at the civilian population. Subsequently, the Federation provided the \\"P officers\\" with material for the troops at the front and supported the soldiers on leave. Both the Opere Federate and :it:Servizio P collaborated with a wide range of partners, printed internal bulletins, and organised conferences to mobilise support for the war. They published talking points for conversations with soldiers and while the Opere Federate put on propaganda plays for the popular theatre, Servizio P staged them for the troops. Press censorship 1918 poster showing a woman in red (alt=Leopoldo Metlicovitz WWI poster.jpg Although slow to mobilise public opinion through active propaganda, the government did act to censor the press. War correspondents were aware of the reality of the front and sent detailed reports to their editors. Nevertheless the reading public saw only articles that hid, and in some cases falsified, much of the truth, in a conscious process of disinformation in which much of the public did not seek objective information. Towards the end of 1915 Giovanni Papini wrote in Il Resto del Carlino that people limited themselves to looking at the official headlines and press releases and that soon, perhaps, they would not even read these anymore. This was probably due to the fact that readers, despite having the vague feeling of being deceived, sought in the newspapers only the confirmation of their illusions. Those lucky enough to escape the horrors of war preferred not to see them described in detail in the newspapers. As the historian Antonio Monti wrote in 1922, with the passage of time this conduct meant that the press had served to deepen and widen the fatal division of the country into the two camps - the troops in the trenches on one hand and \\"imboscati\\" (draft-dodgers) on the other. This division greatly embittered the feelings of the soldiers towards \\"imboscati\\" and towards the journalists themselves. In the writings of officers and soldiers, it was common to find harsh and contemptuous judgments on the press, who were regarded as guilty of distorting the reality of battle by reducing the struggle of millions of men to mere spectacle, falsifying the soldiers' feelings and state of mind. Restrictions on soldiers The army censored the post of soldiers writing to their families, and only rarely granted home leave. The winter of 1915 saw a number of soldiers allowed to return home for the first time, with the intention that this would raise morale. In fact it had the opposite effect. The soldiers realized that the country was unaware of the realities of the war that the newspapers and the military were trying to hide. Hoping for a short war, the Salandra government did not want it to become unpopular so they took no measures to limit general consumption or impose austerity. The soldiers did not find their home towns proud of their sacrifices, ready to welcome them as heroes. The High Command not only forbade them from revealing anything about what was happening at the front, but they also made sure the carabinieri stopped the soldiers from entering cafes or from walking with a girl on their arm. :it:Corrado De Vita wrote \\"I saw so many of those young people enjoying themselves in theaters and cafes that I felt like punching them and hating them more than the Austrians.\\" Propaganda at the front before Caporetto Casa del Soldato (Soldiers‚Äô House), Bologna 1916 Before 1917 propaganda, recreational and welfare initiatives for soldiers were scarce and poorly managed. Propaganda was understood in traditional forms, such as speeches given by officers and invited speakers. As these speakers were exempted from military service, they appeared \\"privileged\\" in the eyes of the infantry. These proclamations about the reasons for the war were entirely alien to the language and mentality of the soldiers, who regarded the requirement to stand and listen to them as a waste of time, which lowered their morale. Giuseppe Prezzolini wrote in his essay Vittorio Veneto: \\"It was called propaganda to order soldiers to attention in a courtyard, after eight hours on duty, and there, taking away an hour of freedom, forcing them to listen to the chatter of a lawyer unused to the fatigue of war.\\" For the vast majority of soldiers, their willingness to fight was not secured through effective propaganda or strong patriotic motivations, but despite this the Italian army gave proof of its reliability, commitment and obedience throughout the three and a half years of war. Only a few Italian soldiers fought with clear ideas and personal conviction, while most did so without understanding the reasons for the war. This was partly due to a very low level of education, and partly due to how the High Command managed the troops. From Luigi Cadorna downwards, commanders were less concerned about motivation and more interested in maintaining discipline through corporal punishment. Up to 1917 troop welfare activities were left to priests who operated with the permission of the High Command but without their involvement. Parish priests had always been important and trusted cultural mediators in peasant communities. One of them, Don :it:Giovanni Minozzi established a network of ‚ÄúCase del Soldato‚Äù, rest houses behind the front where infantrymen could relax, read, listen to music, attend theatrical performances, and obtain help writing letters home. Minozzi sensed that morale and willingness to fight required more subtle methods than lectures imposed by officers, and had to be based on the creation of welcoming and reassuring environments for the soldiers. To convince, it was first necessary to assist and instill trust. Patriotic and ideological discourse was not completely ignored in the Case del Soldato, but it was not imposed. Before Caporetto organised propaganda initiatives took place only in the 2nd Army under Luigi Capello. Army documents from June 1917 show that there was an internal propaganda office, while material and moral assistance was generally left to priests, as for the rest of the army. Capello intended to use propaganda to raise the morale of his troops, which had been undermined by the battles of the Isonzo and established a Propaganda and Education Office. Its first major change was to replace the figures invited to address the men at patriotic meetings. Until then, these had been lawyers, politicians, or senior officers; now they invited with lower officers \\"since the soldier prefers to listen to his officer with whom he is in daily contact, tied by the esteem and affection that arise from the community of deprivation and risks\\" and even with ordinary soldiers. To do this, Capello and his collaborator in the Office, Alessandro Casati, chose eighty men, half of whom were officers, explaining to them the themes and techniques to be adopted. With these men, the soldiers had the impression of actively participating in a discussion rather than passively attending a meeting. On 24 July Capello confirmed the usefulness of these new meetings, which resumed on 11 September after being interrupted by the eleventh battle of the Isonzo. Capello then decided to employ the interventionist artist Ardengo Soffici to support propaganda work by illustrating brochures and magazines aimed at the soldier. The experiment was not followed up due to the breakthrough of Caporetto, but Capello's experiments were subsequently used in a decisive way by the new Servizio P (P Service). Propaganda at the front after Caporetto Propaganda postcard depicting Italia marshalling Italian soldiers to drive back the Austrians on the Piave The defeat at Caporetto marked a turning point in army practice. A new Propaganda Office (Servizio P) was set up with the task of actively persuading men of the need to fight. The main activities of the P service at the front were preparing conversational talking points, which reached the soldiers through new trench newspapers, which described life at the front, without denying its hardship, in a playful, moving and reassuring tone, with new visual and verbal communication techniques. This was the first large-scale operation to condition and form popular opinion in a national-patriotic direction, and it drew on scholars, writers, designers, graphic designers and pedagogues who were effectively the mass media experts of the time, headed by :it:Giuseppe Lombardo Radice. Radice had aimed at modernizing the authoritarian methods used in schools, and in the same way he considered the soldiers as children to be taught, enjoying themselves as they learned the Italian language and national ideology. Shaping public opinion after Caporetto Poster for war bonds depicting Italia fighting off a German attacker ‚ÄúFor you, for you born to live in an Italy stronger, happier and more respected‚Äù Defeat at the battle of Caporetto in October 1917 brought about a revolution in Italian wartime propaganda under a new prime minister, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando and a new commander more sensitive to the morale of his men, Armando Diaz, who replaced Cadorna. The country's citizens and industries had to be mobilized in the face of Austrian invasion and the government realized that a major propaganda effort was now needed both on the home front and on the battlefield. The country and the army began to feel greater solidarity. As enemy soldiers entered Italian territory for the first time, the war took on the character of defense of homeland and family. It seemed to many that the defeat had worked a real \\"miracle\\" both among the troops and in public opinion. Before these initiatives began to take effect, many gloomy forecasts circulated around the country. In the months after Caporetto there was speculation about a further retreat beyond Piave to the Mincio or even beyong the Po, and the possibility of concluding a separate peace with Austria- Hungary was discussed. To try to raise the morale of the country, the editor of Corriere della Sera, Luigi Albertini, published several long articles on how and why Italy should not withdraw from the war. Luigi Einaudi contributed articles demonstrating the impossibility of a separate peace since Italy depended economically on its allies. The most ardent interventionists, led by the Comandini, formed the \\"fascia for national defense\\", in order to fight what they called the \\"parliamentary defeatism\\" of the new Orlando government. Throughout the country, groups and action committees multiplied with the aim of mobilizing citizens against defeatists, traitors and spies. In the wake of this crisis, in November 1917 many of the most notable Italian intellectuals joined in the \\"Committee for National Self-Examination‚Äù in order to rewrite the whole history of Italy, from the Renaissance to the Great War, in the light of Caporetto. This committee, joined by the philosophers Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile, embarked on a wholesale critical review of Italian history, highlighting how Caporetto was a moral defeat to which an educational and ideological explanation was required. However it was very difficult to define what the Italian people really thought or expected. Censorship did not allow the press to expose the events around the defeat freely, or to share its readers‚Äô opinions about them, concerning the war with a certain freedom, nor the opinion that readers had about it. While reports on the mood of the population generally indicated good levels of national cohesion, there were some instances of discontent. Ferdinando Martini, a member of the \\"National Defence Group\\", said that in Valdinievole the peasants were shouting \\"Long live the Germans!\\", While on December 15 Croce wrote a letter to Orlando, warning him that the \\"Neapolitan populace was spreading plans for revolt\\". Many factors contributed to popular attitudes towards the war. Public assemblies were forbidden during the war; workers could be moved to where they were needed for war production and many women had taken up waged work for the first time; long working hours, food shortages and inflation led to sporadic strikes and occasional riots. After Caporetto the government took new steps to try and keep the public onside with the war, promising that after the war there would be land for the peasants and the right to vote. Italian propaganda in Allied countries Before the Orlando government to took office, the efforts of Italian government propaganda in other countries were as limited as they were at home. In the main, advocacy for Italy was led by local associations of expatriate Italians. In Britain, these included the \\"Pro Italia\\" committee set up in London in June 1915, who organised fundraising charity sales and similar events. There was also a British Italian League and a Society of the Friends of Italy. At a more official level, there was also the Italian Chamber of Commerce and the Dante Alighieri Society with offices in London, Glasgow and Cardiff. In addition, a group of correspondents from major Italian newspapers based in Britain had established a press office, the Italian Information Bureau, that worked closely with the Italian embassy and disseminated news from the Italian front in war bulletins. On 1 November 1917 Orlando established an Undersecretariat for Propaganda under :it:Romeo Gallenga Stuart with a particular focus on overseas work. Its main purpose was to build public support for Italian territorial claims at the end of the war, and securing British public support was seen as critically important. Within days, the Soviet Union published all the secret treaties to which Tsarist Russia had been party, exposing to the world for the first time the provisions of the 1915 Treaty of London including Italy's territorial demands in the Balkans. In January 1918 US President Wilson published his Fourteen Points, emphasising the national rights of what was later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which were at odds with Italy's demands. A series of informal contacts began in London which gave rise to the idea of drafting an informal agreement on which any official negotiations could be based. The goal was achieved, during the meetings held on 14 and 18 December 1917 at the home of Wickham Steed, where the Yugoslav Committee met the men responsible for Italian propaganda in England: the Corriere della Sera journalist :it:Guglielmo Emanuel and Colonel Filippo De Filippi. These meetings eventually led to the Torre-Trumbiƒá agreement (7 March 1918), an important step towards the convening of the congress of oppressed nationalities in Rome in April 1918. Title page of ‚ÄúLetters and Drawings of Enzo Valentini‚Äù The Italian Foreign Action Bureau still faced difficulties. A lot of the material sent to it in London was not suitable for use; sometimes pamphlets were delivered translated into Spanish, or things just arrived too late to be used as planned. One of the materials it published was a translation of a soldier‚Äôs letters to his family, Letters and Drawings of Enzo Valentini. Distributed to schools and universities, it was intended to evoke sympathy among the British public. A large number of general interest materials were issued - posters, photographs and postcards - which appeared in clubs, hospitals, and theatres. Supporting a drive to create general positive views about Italy, there were film and theatrical performances, while De Filippi continued to organize meetings and conferences. From 13 to 23 January 1918 he was in Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester explaining Italy‚Äôs war aims, and the essential nature of continued Allied support so that Italy could continue in the common task. Between 300 and 500 people attended each meeting. Meanwhile the British Italian League and the Royal Society of Literature organised a visit by a group of Italian scholars to the main English and Scottish universities. In May 1918 the \\"Italian university mission\\" of important Italian academics, visited the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The British-Italian League also hosted a charity exhibition at the Mendoza Galleries of London featuring the art of the Cascella brothers, who had served in Albania and in Trentino. Italy still held the initiative on territorial claims when it convened The congress of the oppressed nationalities of Austria-Hungary in Rome from 8 to 10 April. At the end of this the parties agreed the right of the Italian, Yugoslav, Polish, Czech and Romanian peoples to freedom in the ‚ÄúPact of Rome‚Äù. The commitments in the Torre-Trumbiƒá agreement were restated, while the areas of disagreement were left unresolved. The Congress was attended by figures from across the range of Italian politics, but their failure to do anything after the Congress to back up their declarations in support of other nationalities meant that nothing substantive was gained by holding it. As the ambiguities of Italy‚Äôs stance towards its neighbours remained unresolved, Britain, France and the United States grew stronger and clearer in their support for the creation of a Yugoslav state. A conference of the Allies was held in London 14 to 17 August 1918, in London, under Lord Northcliffe. This meeting put pressure on Italy to make a clear declaration in favour of Yugoslav independence and unity. Foreign Minister Sonnino was not willing to be pushed into this. He was already encouraging much more nationalist propaganda overseas, through the Dante Alighieri Society. Thus while much of the quasi-official Italian propaganda in Britain aimed to build sympathy and support, government channels took a different and much harder line. After the London meeting Sonnino demanded that all propaganda activities abroad should immediately be placed in the charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Italian victory at Vittorio Veneto only hardened attitudes further, with Italy‚Äôs territorial demands being asserted more clearly, and obviously at odds with the wishes of the other Allies. Ambassador Imperiali reported from London that ‚Äúwe are undoubtedly losing ground here\\". The Observer, which had always been friendly, now criticized Italian politics. Steed's magazine, The New Europe, was openly against Italy. By the time the armistice was signed therefore, Italy‚Äôs propaganda efforts had gained her nothing because of the ambiguity of her positions and lack of trust in her statements. Italian propaganda in Austria-Hungary D‚ÄôAnnunzio‚Äôs leaflets falling over Vienna Before 1918 Italy had made attempts to spread propaganda through Austria-Hungary, but these efforts had been fairly ineffective.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 202 In 1918 representatives from other Allies of World War I met with Italy to help it come up with propaganda techniques against Austria-Hungary. This resulted in the Padua Commission, a military-civilian agency led mostly by Italians, formed to co-ordinate a propaganda offensive.\\"The Nationality Problem in the Habsburg Monarchy in the Nineteenth Century: a Critical Appraisal.\\" Austrian History Yearbook Vol. XXXIII. pg. 284 One of the commission's leaders was :it:Ugo Ojetti who worked together with the Yugoslav Committee and came up with a plan to appeal to the minority groups within Austria-Hungary. The plan included the spread of pamphlets, manifestos and flyers to promote an independent Yugoslavia. The intention as to weaken the loyalty of troops from Slavic ethnic groups, encouraging them to surrender to Italy or turn on Austria-Hungary from within its borders.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria- Hungary, pg. 204 Between May 15 and early November 1918, around 60 million copies of 643 different manifestos and almost 2 million copies of 80 news sheets were spread over Austria-Hungary; three times more than the volume of propaganda spread over Germany by the British during the entire war.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 209 Soon, pro-independence leaflets were finding their way to the front lines. Soldiers then took the leaflets home and shared them with their household or community. Austria-Hungary immediately grew concerned over the disturbances that might be caused on the front lines and domestically, and was forced to divert some of its attention from active propaganda directed at Italy to establishing defensive anti- propaganda campaigns. Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 267 The majority of the leaflets were aimed at Croats, Slovenes and Serbs to rise against the Habsburg monarchy and to establish their own independent nation.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 211 One leaflet, targeting Slovenes and Croats, stated, \\"The decisive battle has begun. Either justice will conquer and the sun of freedom for all nations will shine, or the coarse, brutal force of German militaristic barbarism will conquer, which would signify: further slavery. At this greatest moment it is the duty of every Serb, Croat and Slovene not only not to fight on the Austrian side, but to thrust their bayonets into Magyar and German chests\\".Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 342 The Yugoslav Committee praised the way the Italians treated their prisoners-of-war and affirmed Italy's support for an independent Yugoslavia. On the battlefield, Austro-Hungarian soldiers began surrendering to the Italian military, carrying the pamphlets with them in the hope of better treatment.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 300 Most soldiers said they were surrendering because of hunger and the lack of supplies, but the propaganda was an prompt for them to abscond.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 301 The Austro-Hungary military pursued a tough campaign of investigations into any propaganda it discovered.Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria-Hungary, pg. 268 German military support to Austria-Hungary had made a decisive difference on the Italian front at Caporetto. When Germany pulled back its troops in 1918 to move them to the Western Front, Austria-Hungary was left more exposed. To demoralise its troops, Italy spread news from the Western Front describing the Germans as being obliterated by the British, French, and Americans. Italian propaganda stating that 'an awful abyss yawns under the feet of the German people', and that Habsburg soldiers ought to break their own chains immediately if they were not to suffer the same dismal fate\\".Cornwall, The Undermining of Austria- Hungary, pg. 344 In the summer of 1918 Gabriele D'Annunzio‚Äôs flight over Vienna to drop propaganda leaflets was a high profile exercise to demoralise Austria-Hungary's civilian population.

After receiving his Abitur, his father sent him to the Technical University of Munich, where it was intended that he would become an architect, because, for reasons that are not clear, his father did not want him to become an artist. He did well with the art-related subjects, but The technical subjects proved to be too difficult for him, so he and his father came to an understanding. First, he finished learning the basics of painting at home, then went to study with Joseph Wenglein. He decided to work as a landscape painter, so his father's influence was significant, although he gave more attention to staffage. He also practiced more plein aire painting. Toward the end of his short life, he turned to Impressionism. In the fall of 1891, he developed an unspecified mental illness, and died two years later in a psychiatric hospital.

Life and career Armstrong was born in Edinburgh and studied music at Edinburgh University, but after teaching for some years he chose a theatrical career in preference to a musical one. He made his professional stage debut with Sir Frank Benson's company at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon in 1908. He made his first London appearance the following year in Julius Caesar. Subsequently he toured in Germany with Meta Illing's English company, and from 1910 to 1912 he was a member of the Glasgow Repertory Theatre Company.Parker, p. 20 In 1912‚Äì13 he toured the US in Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblock's play Milestones. In September 1914, he joined the Liverpool Repertory Company. He moved on to the Birmingham Repertory Company in 1916, and from 1917 to 1919 toured army camp theatres. In September 1920, he was with the Everyman Theatre repertory company, and in 1922 he toured with Mrs Patrick Campbell in Hedda Gabbler. Armstrong had made a strong impression in Liverpool, and when, in 1922, the company was in financial trouble and in need of an effective young director he was invited to take the post.

Built by Charles IV, it was bought by an Italian count, then owned by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta before being broken into flats during communism. It was then squatted in 1993, becoming an internationally famous anarchist, self-managed social centre which was evicted in 2000. After several years of renovation, Ladronka was re-opened as an activities centre in 2005, to serve the park it sits within. There are facilities for dining, cycling, rollerskating, beach volleyball and football.  History  Ladronka was built as a homestead by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in 1340. It was a vineyard and stopping point on the road to Karl≈°tejn castle. An Italian nobleman, the Count Filip Ferdinand de la Crone (or Lacrone), bought the farm in 1688 and it came to be known as Ladronka in a Czech mispronunciation of his name. Ladronka was subsequently owned by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, then divided into flats under communism. After the Velvet Revolution it stood derelict and was squatted.  Self-managed social centre  Ladronka was occupied by anarchists in 1993 and became a self-managed social centre. Among the people living there was rapper Vladim√≠r 518. The squatters organised events such as gigs, exhibitions, readings and theatre, also publishing the magazine Autonomie. The first police raid came in February 1994 and the squatters mustered support with demonstrations and petitions. A year later in January 1995, a large police raid searched the entire building and arrested eight squatters. The squat was not evicted but there were plans to turn the building into a hotel, so the squatters mobilised support again. At a public meeting, local people voiced their opposition to the development plans. An eviction date had been set and on the day the squatters symbolically handed over a paper model of the building to the municipality and continued the occupation. The social centre became internationally famous as a hub for counter-cultural activities and anarchist organisation. The squatters formed the Ladronka Foundation and successfully negotiated with the city of Prague to legalise the occupation. By the late 1990s, the focus of the centre was shifting from politics to cultural activities, as part of a general downturn in anarchist activity in the Czech Republic. By this time, the city had signed a contract with the Sant√© group which planned to develop Ladronka into a luxury medical centre. The social centre was evicted on 9 November 2000 by private security and police as part of a moral panic following the anti-globalization protests in Prague. The eviction was not mandated by any juridical decision.  Activities centre  After Ladronka was evicted, it was used as a training facility for police dog handlers. Reconstruction plans were delayed by various factors such as the floods in 2002 and the discovery of archaeological remains on the site. Since the park surrounding the building, now known as Ladronka Park, was used for recreation, a plan was devised to use the Ladronka homestead as an activities centre. At a cost of 80 million crowns, born by Prague 6 and the city of Prague, Ladronka was renovated. It now houses facilities for cycling, rollerskating and other sports. Equipment can be hired and there is a restaurant. Later, beach volleyball and football courts were added. It was opened in September 2005, marking the 85th anniversary of Prague 6. The following year, the centre was nominated for Building of the Year, as decided by the ABF foundation. The leisure centre is rented from Prague 6 by Ladronka s.r.o. and is located at Tomanova 1028/1 in the B≈ôevnov district of Prague 6.

They speak the Bakairi language, one of the Cariban languages. They call themselves Kur√¢, Bakairi being a Portuguese term of unknown origin. They currently live in the Santana and Bakairi Indigenous Territories of northern Mato Grosso, in the northern cerrado south of the Amazon rain forest. Like most native peoples, they were more numerous before European contact. In 1999 there were about 950 Bakairi, of whom 898 lived in the two Indigenous Territories. In 1965 only 261 were recorded. History According to the Bakairi, they first lived in the rainforest on the Teles Pires (a branch of the Tapajos) below its confluence with the Verde, a large left tributary which comes in west of Sinop, Mato Grosso about 1000 km south of the Amazon, 400 km north of Cuiaba and 200 km west of the Xingu. Due to internal quarrels and conflict with their neighbors, mainly Kayab√≠, they moved south in three groups. The small western group went south to 'Santana‚Äô on the upper Arinos River, about 250 km north of Cuiaba. They were first contacted in the early 18th century and began to work in mineral extraction. From 1847 they were involved with the General Directorate of Indians in Cuiaba and later began to work in rubber extraction where they seem to have been abused. In the 1920s and 1960s many moved east to the central group. In 1965 an Indigenous Post was established and is now the Santana Indigenous Territory or Territorio Kur√¢ Bakairi. They resisted assimilation. The first school was established in 1975. The central group moved south to the headwaters of the Teles Pires about 150 km east of Santana. They were first contacted by the Portuguese in the early 19th century and began working in agriculture and cattle raising. In 1889 a Captain Telles Pires took many Bakairi as paddlers to explore the river that now bears his name, but all of them died. The Bakairi Indigenous Territory was established here in 1920. It is about twice the size of the western Territory. Some Chavante moved from the Xingu to the Territory, outnumbering the Bakairi, but in 1974 they moved back to the Coluene River, branch of the Xingu. The eastern and largest group moved to the upper Xingu northeast of the central group, an area almost unknown to Europeans. Here they lost contact with the other two groups. In 1884 Karl von den Steinen had some central Bakairi lead him to the eastern group on the Batavi River. Fifteen years later another German explorer, Hermann Meyer, found them on the Coliseu River (another branch of the Xingu) and judged them depopulated and corroded by the western Bakairi's ‚Äòcivilization‚Äô. In 1923 they seem to have moved to the central Bakairi.

History and mission  The National Food Institute (NFI) was established on October 15, 1996 by the Ministry of Thailand via cabinet resolution, order No. 440/2539 dated November 28, 1996. The NFI was founded to be an independent organization to promote and facilitate the development of Thailand's food industry. NFI's stated mission is, \\"To provide academic and technical knowledge and updated information that can enhance food research and development within the government and the private sectors so as to boost the competitiveness of the food sector.\\" They further state that they are \\"a core agency that provides both academic and technological services to create value of Thai food for the benefit for the country‚Äôs food industry development at the international level.\\" It was reported on November 8, 2016 that NFI, along with the 10 other independent organizations under the Ministry of Industry, were to be tasked to develop key Thai industries. This was part of the Ministry of Industry's proposed plan for a new venture capital fund to support startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in gaining access to funding. In 2016, the NFI was also very active in promoting halal food certification to help the Thai food industry move into the Islamic food industry. The NFI president at the time, Yongvut Saovapruk, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with officials from Japan Halal Development and Promotion, a government agency for boosting halal food standards in Japan and promoting Japanese food products in Muslim countries. Under the MOU, the NFI would assist Japanese investors to gain the official halal trademark from the Central Islamic Council of Thailand. On August 8, 2019, the NFI signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) to conduct joint research and development and create a network of food researchers. The NFI also said that it would offer internship opportunities to AIT students and participate in the AIT Entrepreneurship Centre that would work with Thai small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). In November 2019, it was reported that scientists from the NFI were working with scientists from the Technical University of Denmark's (DTU) and Aarhus University in Denmark and that they had developed a method to distill protein powder from grass matter, particularly ryegrass. The resulting human digestible powder has a similar amino acid profile to soy, eggs, and whey and can be used in a variety of food applications. As of August 15, 2020, the NFI president was Mrs. Anong Paijiprapapon.  Services and Programs  As of December, 2017, the NFI has services based on around three main missions: #To enhance competitive-edge and flexibility among Thai food entrepreneurs and to create a network of ‚ÄòFood Warriors‚Äô‚Äînew-generation of food entrepreneurs who will serve the industry in the future.

Its best-known unit was Handy Dan Improvement Centers, which prefigured The Home Depot; the company also briefly owned London Drugs as well as Great Eastern, which gave rise to Linens 'n Things. Amnon Barness, an Israeli immigrant, co-founded the company in 1960 with an investment of $10,000. The company grew aggressively over the next two decades by acquiring retail operations around the United States, notably drugstores, home improvement centers, and discount stores. By 1969, Daylin had 50 corporate divisions and subsidiaries employing around 13,000 employees. In 1973 it was reported to operate 700 stores. Handy Dan In 1968, Daylin acquired El Monte, California-based chain Angels Home Improvement Centers to add to its Handy Dan unit. Angels' founder, Sidney Kline, was hired as Daylin's chief of mergers and acquisitions. By 1973, when Kline left the firm, Handy Dan had grown to 43 stores with annual sales of $52 million in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and California. By mid-1974, Daylin's aggressive expansion, intense local competition, and high indebtedness in a high-interest rate economic environment had led to significant financial problems, and the company began to sell off underperforming assets, including its drugstore operations. Arthur Blank, who had joined the company when Daylin acquired his family's pharmacy and risen to president of the Elliott's Drug Stores/Stripe Discount Stores unit, was invited to join Handy Dan by Bernard Marcus. Sanford C. Sigoloff, who had previously rescued Republic Corp, was brought in as president in January 1975 to oversee a turnaround. Daylin filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on February 26, 1975, the second largest retail bankruptcy within a year. Daylin was accordingly delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Sigoloff became known for his \\"slash-and-burn\\" strategy of appeasing investors at the expense of employees during restructuring, for which he was dubbed \\"Ming the Merciless\\" and \\"Mr. Chapter 11.\\" Following his 260-page plan, which employees called the I.B.B. (\\"Infamous Black Book\\"), Sigoloff fired more than half the firm's 16,000 employees, but brought Daylin out of bankruptcy in 18 months. The Handy Dan and London Drugs operations were not included in the filing; women's clothing chain Diana, Handy Dan, and a line of hospital pharmacies would form the core of the surviving business. Sigoloff came into conflict with Marcus and Blank over the structure and control of the Handy Dan division. In 1978 he fired them, ostensibly for allowing an employee to set up a fund to improperly fight a unionization effort in San Jose, California stores. Marcus and Blank founded The Home Depot the same year. On January 5, 1979, W. R. Grace and Company made an unsolicited offer to acquire Daylin. It completed the acquisition on March 19. Operations Brands owned by Daylin include the following: * Angels Home Improvement Centers * Diana * Disco Department Stores * Elliot's Drug Stores * Great Eastern * Gulf Mart * Handy Dan Home Improvement Centers * H.C. Enterprises * King Clothing * London Drugs * Miller's Discount Department Stores * Shoppers World * Stripe Discount Health and Beauty Aid References Category:American companies established in 1960 Category:American companies disestablished in 1979 Category:Retail companies established in 1960 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 1979 Category:Companies based in Los Angeles ","title":"Daylin"},{"id":"65439907","text":"General Population (or Population G√©n√©rale) on the island of Mauritius refers to the community of inhabitants who belong to the ethnic groups Mauritian Creoles, Franco-Mauritians and Tamil Mauritians. Within the General Population there is further division based on skin colour and social status. It also includes most of the inhabitants of Rodrigues as well as Chagossians who usually identify as Mauritian Creoles. According to the Constitution of Mauritius there are 4 distinct communities on the island for the purposes of representation in the National Assembly. Schedule I, Paragraph 3(4) of the Constitution states that The population of Mauritius shall be regarded as including a Hindu community, a Muslim community, and a Sino-Mauritian community,and every person who does not appear, from his way of life, to belong to one or other of those three communities shall be regarded as belonging to the General Population, which shall itself be regarded as a fourth community. Thus each ethnic group in Mauritius falls within one of the four main communities known as Hindus, General Population, Muslims and Sino- Mauritians. Origins In 1829 an Ordinance in Council abolished racial discrimination for free subjects of all ethnic groups on the island. This new law was in preparation for the Abolition of Slavery by the British rulers. As a result the inhabitants could no longer be officially described as \\"blacks\\" or \\"whites\\". Thus all blacks, coloured and white were grouped as General Population. During the census of 1846 the distinct groups were defined as \\"General Population\\", \\"Ex-apprentices (freed slaves)\\", and \\"Indian and other immigrant labourers\\". People of Indian origins who embraced Christianity became classified as General Population by 1931. By 1944 the island's population was further divided on religious grounds: Christians in the General Population and Indians into Hindus and Muslims. The People Representation Ordinance of 1958 was introduced by the Secretary of State to ensure representation of the 3 main sections of the population (Hindus, General Population and Muslims) in the legislature in numbers that were proportional to the population as a whole.

This became a political phenomenon after the Velvet Revolution in 1989. Squats in Prague included Sochora (an infoshop), Stary St≈ôe≈°ovice (a cultural project) and Ladronka (an anarchist self-managed social centre). Milada was occupied in 1998 and following its final eviction in 2009, there was a lull in squatting actions. In the 2010s a new movement (Obsaƒè a ≈Ωij) squatted houses to protest emptiness and the social centre Klinika was founded in 2014. History After World War II, Czechoslovakia became a communist state. There was no organised squatting movement, only people occupying derelict spaces as a place to live in times of desperation. Private property was protected by article 249a of the Czech Criminal Code, established in 1961.  Post-communism  alt=Exterior of renovated Ladronka Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, squats appeared in cities across Czechoslovakia. In Prague, anarchist and punk activists inspired by squatting movements in Amsterdam and Berlin occupied derelict houses. In the Hole≈°ovice district anarchists squatted a building at Pplk. Sochora street, setting up an infoshop. The squat was attacked several times by neo-Nazis and was evicted by police in December 1992, then re-squatted. By 1997, the squatters had achieved legalisation, albeit being settled in a different, smaller building. Other occupations included Zlat√° loƒè (1990-1994) and Buƒè√°nka (1991-1992). The early 1990s were a golden age for squatting in the Czech Republic, since following the breakdown of state communism there was a period of fluidity before the state reasserted itself. Ladronka was occupied in 1993 and became a self- managed social centre. It was evicted in the furore following the 2000 anti- globalization protests in Prague. In St≈ôe≈°ovice in Prague 6, artists occupied three houses in 1998 and reinstituted the Med√°k association, putting on cultural events. The district council offered them a lease on one of the houses but the association refused, saying it needed more space. The association was later evicted in 2003. Papirna in Hole≈°ovice existed from 1997 until 2004. alt=Exterior of building On May Day 1998, anarchist activists from Ladronka occupied Milada, a derelict villa in Libe≈à. A Food Not Bombs collective cooked there and the space was used for meetings and punk gigs. As with Ladronka, the aims of the original collective faded, then in 2007 Milada was reinvigorated by new, younger participants, before being evicted in 2009. In the summer of 2002, activists occupied ≈†afr√°nka in Prague 6. This homestead had been proposed as a replacement for Ladronka in 1997 and then stayed empty. Upon being threatened with eviction the squatters moved to the roof for two weeks.  2010s  alt=Exterior of building In the 2010s, most squatting actions continued to be in Prague, although there were also squatted projects in for example Olomouc. Cibulka is a derelict homestead constructed in the 14th century which has been occupied several times since the 1990s. In 2007 the villa was reoccupied and then evicted after a fight in which three police officers and four squatters were injured. It was reoccupied again in 2012 and the owner granted permission for the squatters to live there, only to withdraw the licence in 2015, when the building was again evicted. To mark the twentieth anniversary of the eviction of Ladronka, the group Vzpominky na budoucnost (Memories of the Future) occupied empty houses in 2013. The buildings were all quickly evicted and this gave rise to the movement Obsaƒè a ≈Ωij (Occupy and Live) which for the next two years occupied long-term empty houses in order to provoke a discussion on dereliction in Prague. For the first time since the early 1990s, the mainstream media reacted positively to the spectacular actions, in particular supporting a day-long occupation of an empty building owned by billionaire real estate investor Radovan V√≠tek. Klinika, a former medical centre in ≈Ωi≈ækov, Prague, was occupied in November 2014. It was quickly evicted, but after demonstrations were held in support and celebrities backed the project, it was granted a one year contract by the Finance Minister, Andrej Babi≈°. After the contract expired, Klinika was not given up and thus became squatted again. The centre organised a community laundry, a kindergarden, an infoshop, migrant support and benefit gigs. It was finally evicted in 2019. Ladronka, Milada and Klinika are the longest lasting and most influential squats in the Czech Republic.

She is behind the project Beyond Curie. Phingbodhipakkiya is a neuroscientist-turned-artist and an advocate of STEM. She is known for conveying complex scientific ideas via art. Phingbodhipakkiya was born and raised in the outskirts of Atlanta to Thai and Indonesia immigrant parents. Education and Career Phingbodhipakkiya earned a bachelor's degree in neuroscience from Columbia University. She then worked as a researcher at Columbia Medical Center and conducted a study regarding Alzheimer's disease. Phingbodhipakkiya later obtained a master's degree in Communication Design from Pratt Institute. She worked as a creative for several companies until she established her own career and went full-time as a multidisiciplinary artist. Phingbodhipakkiya had written content about neuroscience for Inc. and TED. She also writes occasionally at Medium. Phingbodhipakkiya works as an artist-in-residence for NYC Commission of Human Rights. From a Scientist to an Artist At a young age, Phingbodhipakkiya associated and questioned the relationship between science and art. As a child, she was fascinated by the aesthetic appeal of the wings of a butterfly, and her mother decided to buy a microscope so she could better observe them. Phingbodhipakkiya then pondered how art, design, and science are interconnected and wondered how they are seen as completely separate and different fields in education. As an adult, from a neuroscientist, Phingbodhipakkiya eventually became an artist. When asked how she made the jump, Phingbodhipakkiya recalled an incident when she used to work for Columbia Medical Center: A patient once asked her what is her contribution to science. She gave the research paper in response and later regretted it because the average person would not be interested in reading very dense scientific papers and therefore would not understand. She then pondered how to become a better storyteller and how to better express complex ideas in a digestible way to a wider and broader audience and found herself delving into design. As an Artist Phingbodhipakkiya is a multidisciplinary artist and has utilized augmented reality, interactive installation and biodesign on her projects and exhibits. Phingbodhipakkiya's art is usually colorful and she considers space to be a vital aspect in her craft. She cites artist Bruno Munari as her inspiration as she is fascinated by how he pairs colors and shapes.

Preparations of the twigs and leaves are said to have analgesic effects upon body (muscular ?) pains and intestinal pain and to be beneficial in cases of colitis and dysentery. The root decoction or infusion is considered to be effective as an aphrodisiac, an anthelmintic, an analgesic and a treatment for colds, yellow fever and kidney disease. The roots are chewed to treat stomach pain, the crushed roots are applied topically to treat wounds and snake bites and the root bark is used as an ingredient in arrow poisons. *Mostuea batesii (syn. M. stimulans): the root bark is considered a powerful stimulant and aphrodisiac, antimalarial and antileishmanial, while a decoction of the root bark is administered to children as an anthelmintic. Both the roots and stem bark are considered psychoactive (stimulant and hallucinogenic), aphrodisiac and antipyretic. Also used in magic and ritual, including initiation rites. Hallucinogen Father Andr√© Raponda-Walker,the scholar who first drew the attention of the scientific community to the use of Mostuea spp. as entheogens. De Smet (1996) provides a short, but nonetheless informative overview of the (almost exclusively French) accounts of the use of Mostuea as a ceremonial entheogen with iboga-like aphrodisiac effects. He notes that the first accounts of the psychoactive properties of Mostuea in the scientific literature are to be found in two papers by French botanist, taxonomist and explorer Auguste Chevalier (1873-1956) published in 1946 and 1947.Chevalier, A., 1946, Le Sata Mbwanda racine stimulante et aphrodisiaque employ√©e par les Noirs du Gabon et son identification botanique, Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences 223, pps. 767-769Chevalier, A., 1947, Les Mostuea africains et leurs propri√©t√©s stimulantes, Revue de Botanique Appliqu√© 27, pps. 104-109. Chevalier's informant was the Catholic priest and renowned authority on Gabonese language and culture, Father Andr√© Raponda-Walker (1871-1968), who later included information on Mostuea in his own collaborative work of 1961 (with Roger Sillans) on the ethnobotany of Gabon.Les Plantes Utiles du Gabon (with Roger Sillans), Paris, Le Chevalier, 1961, 614 p. (Coll. Encyclop√©die biologique, 56). Chevalier reported that the inhabitants of the Gabonese region in the vicinity of the Fernan Vaz Lagoon (Ogoou√©-Maritime Province) made ceremonial use of a certain root known as Sata mbwanda in Nkomi (one of the Myene languages) and S√©t√© mbwund√® in Bakole. > \\"This root\\" (writes Father Walker) \\"is considered to possess an action > comparable to those of Tabernanthe iboga and Schumanniophyton. It is a > potent aphrodisiac and also a stimulant. During nights set aside for > dancing,the Blacks chew the roots, whole or grated, to drive away sleep. But > the majority consume them during their dances - either on their own or mixed > with Iboga - for the sexual excitement which they cause. Excessive use of > this drug can lead to cerebral troubles\\". [translated from the French of > Auguste Chevalier] Chevalier notes that two species of Mostuea were used in the practices described above: M. stimulans ( - Latin stimulans = \\"stimulating\\" - now known correctly as M. batesii) and M. gabonica (now M. hirsuta), but that the former was used more frequently. He then proceeds to describe in detail roots of M. batesii which he had received and which, it is apparent from his description, were dried, unlike the fresh ones referenced by Raponda-Walker. > They are straight or zigzag in form, sometimes even corkscrew-shaped, of a > brown colour, 15 to 25cm long, more or less branched and ending in slender > rootlets; the biggest have about the thickness of a pencil (5mm in diameter) > in the upper part, but very thin at the tip. The root bark is thin (1 to 1.5 > mm thick) and difficult to peel off. The outer root bark is greyish-brown > and wrinkled longitudinally while the inner bark...is of a whiteish grey. > When wetted, it takes on a shade of white tinged with ochre or pink. Chewed > whole, or reduced to powder before being placed in the mouth, the flavour of > the root is very bitter at first but, after causing some salivation, becomes > reminiscent of chewed kola nut. Thereafter, it causes a certain euphoria > and, if the dose taken be rather strong, a sort of inebriation. =Parallels with hallucinogen-like effects of Gelsemium= In the second edition of their classic work on plant-derived psychotropic drugs The Botany and Chemistry of Hallucinogens Richard Evans Schultes and Albert Hofmann place Gelsemium sempervirens in a short appendix consisting simply of a list of the names of plants of dubious hallucinogenic use (the third and lowest level of confidence in their system of classification). The basis for such a placement rests on occasional references in the literature to instances of the use of Gelsemium sempervirens in contexts reminiscent of the use of a psychotropic drug. One such example ( - that invites comparison with Raponda-Walker's comments on Gabonese use of the related Mostuea - ) is to be found in Louis Lewin's early 20th century classic Phantastica: > during a severe attack of rheumatism a man took a large quantity of an > alcoholic tincture of Gelsemium sempervirens a plant which is liable to act > on the brain and the medulla oblongata. Noticing an appreciable result he > continued to take it, and finally became a slave to the drug. He gradually > augmented the quantity, and reached 30 gr. of the tincture in one dose. > Slowly he became pale, agitated, and discontented. He wasted away. > Hallucination set in, and his state grew worse until disorders of the > intelligence appeared. As he continued to increase the doses he fell into > idiocy and died in a state of mental confusion.Lewin L. Phantastica. Die > bet√§ubenden und erregenden Genussmittel. F√ºr √Ñrzte und Nicht√§rzte (trans. > Phantastica: Narcotic and Stimulating Drugs. For Doctors and Non-doctors) > Berlin: Verlag von Georg Stilke, 1924. Lewin's \\"disorders of the intelligence\\" manifested in the later stages of the victim's Gelsemium addiction recall immediately Raponda-Walker's \\"Excessive use of this drug [Mostuea] can lead to cerebral troubles\\". Furthermore, while there is no mention in Lewin's account of Mostuea-like sexual excitation, there is mention of \\"agitation\\" recalling wakefulness / stimulation, and \\"hallucination\\". The full-blown addiction, [\\"became a slave to the drug\\"] suggests not merely the victim's relief from his rheumatic pain, but some pleasurable effect [compare Raponda-Walker's \\"euphoria\\" induced by a moderate dose of Mostuea root]. =In the wider context of entheogens used in indigenous Gabonese religions= Like several other hallucinogenic plants used in the spiritual practices of Gabon Emboden, William, 1979, Narcotic Plants, pub. Studio Vista, New York: MacMillan., such as Bwiti, Mostuea has languished in the shadow of the more celebrated drug Iboga, derived from the Apocynaceous shrub Tabernanthe iboga (as late as the 1960s, itself an obscure psychotropic Chapter beginning page 171. \\\\- although now enjoying a new-found celebrity as a treatment for a variety of addictions - notably addiction to heroin).Mash, D.C., Kovera, C.A., Pablo, J. et al. Ibogaine in the treatment of heroin withdrawal Alkaloids Chem Biol. 2001; 56: pps. 155-171. 11705106 Raponda- Walker's account reveals certain problems inherent in the study of Mostuea: not only are the reported effects similar to those of Iboga, but the drug is (or was) often consumed with Iboga, such that a measure of confusion could easily arise as to which drug were responsible for the wakefulness and sexual arousal observed in the participants in Gabonese dance rites. It is also unclear if Mostuea is a true hallucinogen: in contrast to Iboga - which can evoke strong and colourful visions - there is no overt mention in the literature of such visual phenomena in Mostuea intoxication. Raponda-Walker likens the effects of Mostuea to those of Iboga which might - or might not - be understood to mean that it can cause visual hallucinations in addition to acting as a sleep-dispelling stimulant and aphrodisiac (in lower doses Iboga is used as stimulant - e.g. by lion-hunters who must remain alert and immobile for days on end - and also as a powerful aphrodisiac). Chevalier speaks only of \\"euphoria\\" and \\"a sort of inebriation\\" inviting comparison to opiate or alcohol intoxication rather than any visionary state. Chemistry As of 1996 the only chemical and pharmacological evaluation of the genus Mostuea which had been undertaken was that of Paris and Moyse-Mignan, carried out upon M. batesii (as M. stimulans) in 1949. Paris, R. and Moyse-Mignan, H., √âtude chimique et pharmacodynamique pr√©liminaire d'une Loganiac√©e du Gabon: Mostuea stimulans A. Chev., Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences 229, pps. 86-88 These researchers found the alkaloid content of the leafy twigs to be a meagre 0.06% - compared with 0.15% in the entire roots and a more substantial 0.33% in the root bark (in keeping with reports that it was the roots and not the aerial parts of the plant that featured in Gabonese ritual use). Two of the alkaloids present in the root bark bore some resemblance to Gelsemium alkaloids: one showed similarities to sempervirine, while the other exhibited certain properties similar to those of gelsemine. In neither case, however, was a definitive identification made. Quattrocchi noted in 2012 that the terpenoid indole alkaloid camptothecin (better known as an active constituent of Camptotheca acuminata, Nyssaceae) had been isolated from the widespread species Mostuea brunonis, which shares at least the aphrodisiac properties attributed in folk medicine to M. batesii.A recent study found Mostuea brunonis to contain several indole alkaloids. The stems and leaves yielded gelsemicine, mostueine and some related compounds and the roots sempervirine and (as noted above by Quattrocchi) the quinoline-based alkaloid camptothecin.Prota4u website https://www.prota4u.org/database/protav8.asp?g=pe&p;=Mostuea+brunonis+Didr.

Background In the late 1980s, the country was under a tense situation with two insurgencies ravaging northern and southern parts of Sri Lanka. The first insurgency was initiated by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and several Tamil militant groups in 1983, seeking to create an independent Tamil state in the northern and eastern parts of the country. In 1987, neighboring India intervened in the conflict to bring an end to the fighting between the insurgents and the Sri Lankan armed forces. That year, the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed between the two countries and Indian Peace Keeping Force was deployed in northern Sri Lanka to enforce disarmament of militant organizations and to watch over the regional council. JVP and other radical groups viewed this as a proliferation of Indian expansionism. This suspicion was fuelled by the perceived threat of northeastern autonomy, due to the presence of Indian Army in Sri Lankan soil. By this time, JVP was equipped with experiences of a failed insurrection in 1971, against the government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Under these circumstances, the party launched a second insurrection in 1987, seeking to overthrow the then United National Party government. Prison break JVP attacked the prison in December 1988 seeking to free prisoners and increase the hostility within the country to \\"heat up\\" the rebellion. This was one of the notable attacks carried out by the DJV led by Saman Piyasiri Fernando. After the insurgency the JVP was criticized for this attack alongside many others.Missed opportunities, War on terror revisited JVP was mostly based in Kandy where they conducted more attacks such as the attack on the Temple of Tooth. JVP was attacking the Bogambara prison to free Premakumar Gunaratnam who was imprisoned the same year for his affliation with the DJV and with Tamil Militant groups of Marxist orientation. Aftermath In 2001 the attack was a allegation by opposing parties to the JVP while they denied active involvement. They claimed the Deshpremi Janatha Viyaparaya was a independent group - operated separately. Some of its major leaders like Kosala claimed direct reponsability on the attacks including the 1987 Bogambara prison attack.

The term Gebildbrot (from the German word for \\"shaped bread\\") was used first by the German historian and folklorist Ernst Ludwig Rochholz (1809-1892). The German Folklore Dictionary, published in 1974, is already critical of such opinions of the ‚Äúpopular mythologists of the 19th century‚Äù, although it gives a detailed account of them. Rather, one should reckon with the \\"personal drive to sculpt the manufacturer and with baker's whims\\" or the requirements of the baking process (perforation, splitting). Most common pastries are made from yeast dough, which has been traceable since the 15th century. Around 1700 there were yeast cultivations, which were primarily aimed at the needs of beer brewers and schnapps distillers and were not very suitable for bakers. It was not until the 19th century that new brewery technologies made sufficient baker's yeast available. From this alone, the pre-Christian cultic theories lead ad absurdum.

The phone was officially announced on September 30, 2020, alongside the Pixel 4a (5G), and will be released in the United States on October 29, 2020. This is the first flagship smartphone in the Pixel lineup not to feature an XL version.  Specifications  = Design and hardware = The Pixel 5 is constructed using a \\"100% recycled aluminum enclosure\\" and Gorilla Glass 6 for the screen. The device is available in Just Black and Sorta Sage colors, both of which have a matte finish. The housing has a thin coating of plastic, while the power button is anodized with a metallic finish. The bottom of the device has a USB-C connector which is used for charging and audio output. It has stereo speakers, one of which is an under display unit with the other speaker located to the right of the USB-C port. The back houses a capacitive fingerprint reader, which was removed on the Pixel 4. The Pixel 5 uses the mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G system- on-chip (consisting of eight Kryo 475 cores, an Adreno 620 GPU and a Hexagon 696 DSP), with 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128 GB of non-expandable UFS 2.1 internal storage. Also used on the Pixel 4a (5G), the Snapdragon 765G allows for standard 5G connectivity; both \\"sub-6\\" and millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks are supported. The Pixel 5's has a 4080 mAh battery, a significant increase over its predecessor's 2800 mAh battery. It is capable of fast- charging at up to 18 W, and supports Qi wireless charging as well as reverse wireless charging. This is enabled through a cutout in the back panel for the wireless charging coil, covered by bio-resin. It retains the water protection rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529. The Pixel 4's Motion Sense capabilities and facial recognition have been omitted, as well as Active Edge and Pixel Neural Core. The Pixel 5 features a 6-inch (152mm) 1080p OLED display with HDR10+ support, that operates at a refresh rate of up to 90 Hz; it dynamically adjusts depending on content to preserve battery life. The display has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and adopts a design aesthetic similar to the Pixel 4a, with slim uniform bezels and a circular cutout in the upper left hand corner for the front-facing camera. The Pixel 5 includes dual rear-facing cameras located within a raised square module. While the wide camera is unchanged, it includes an ultrawide lens replacing the Pixel 4's telephoto lens. The wide 28 mm 77¬∞ f/1.7 lens has the Sony Exmor IMX363 12.2-megapixel sensor, while the ultrawide 107¬∞ f/2.2 lens has a 16-megapixel sensor; both sensors are shared with the Pixel 4a (5G).

Background  Boroli refugee settlement was first opened on 1 January 2014 to host South Sudanese that fled insecurity in their country of origin due to the 2013 civil war. Boroli refugee settlement also hosts a minority of refugees from Ethiopian and Somalian countries.  Education  Access to quality education is restricted by a high student to staff ratio which often affects effective teaching and limited facilities such as classrooms, desks and teaching materials. High tuition fees of 10,000 shillings per term for primary and 400,000 shillings for secondary school have inhibited enrolment and parents often are forced to sell food to pay for the tuition fees of their children to help them realize their educational pursuit for a better way of living being educated. Sudanese and South Sudanese refugees at Boroli refugee camp in Northern Uganda have complained about lack of basic services such as health and education in the area. This has come to a point where the basic education service is very important to the refugees. At Boroli Primary School, the Lutheran World Federation - LWF has created and facilitated the running of the Child Rights Club of which young girls are given the privilege to express themselves through the leadership and space sharing for the youth.  Social Services  Women that give birth to their newborn babies are given healthcare tool kits that help support them raise their babies with health facilities to take care of their admissions for giving birth, a services funded and supported by UNFPA in the nearby Biira Health centre. Save The Children - STC has a Child Development Centre located in Boroli refugee settlement and aims at helping the young children cope with their infant development by providing them different learning kits that support them with the basic development stages. VFH - Voice For Humanity, is a Non-Profit Organization that specializes in women's empowerment through skills training and microloans, with plans to implement women's health programs in the different camps of which Boroli refugee settlement is a direct beneficiary.  Healthcare  There is a UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund provided and facilitated an ambulance that supports the refugees of the Boroli camp to be transferred in case of emergencies to the health facility of Biira Health Care for some immediate help and service. The Ambulance also gives support to the nearby camps bordering Boroli camp. This helps them to be in constant reminder of being taken care of. Teenage and young mothers are given proper health and fitness and advice on the matters related to their menstrual circles and personal hygiene and this has encouraged them to be aware and fight the claims that comes with the cultural biases due to the same. The health experts and the young women as well as the girls fight the myths regarding menstruation in the Boroli refugee settlement due to the facility put in place.

It is the first and oldest newspaper in East Timor. The current publication is the continuation of Suara Timor Timur, which ceased publication in 1999.  History  Suara Timor Lorosae was first published as Suara Timor Timur (an Indonesian name with the same translation as above), a daily newspaper in the former Indonesian province of East Timor. It was first published on 1 February 1993, at the same date of Xanana Gusm√£o first day of trial in Dili district court.

The original motto was Persatuan dan Pembangunan (Unity and Development), later changed to Menyuarakan Kebenaran dan Keadilan (Voicing the Truth and Justice). Suara Timor Timur published its last edition on 3 September 1999 and fully stopped its publication a day later due to the massive looting, destruction and burning by the Indonesian military-backed militias following the independence referendum. Consequently, all facilities of the newspaper such as building, printing machines and thousands of tons of newsprint were totally destroyed and burnt down. The newspaper was revived on 25 May 2000, this time as Suara Timor Lorosae. It was decided to keep the word Suara, which is the Indonesian word for \\"voice\\", as Suara Timor Timur was well known and part of history of the rebirth paper. The main name differences is the word Timur (in Indonesian) is changed to Lorosae (in Tetum), both means \\"east\\", and the words A Voz de (Portuguese for \\"voice\\") above the word Suara, thus the name can also be read as A Voz de Timor Lorosae with the same meaning.

It was also the site of the Legislature's election of William Lunalilo and David KalƒÅkaua as king in 1873 and 1874, respectively. A riot that broke out following the election of KalƒÅkaua caused significant damage to the building and its contents. The Legislature and Judiciary moved out of the Honolulu Courthouse in 1874 and the building was subsequently sold to H. Hackfeld and Company, which used the building for office and warehouse space until it was demolished in 1968 to make room for a new office complex.  Background  King Kamehameha III and his Kuhina Nui, KekƒÅuluohi, promulgated the Hawaiian Kingdom's first written constitution in 1840, which formally established the Kingdom's Supreme Court and Legislature.Kuykendall, The Hawaiian Kingdom, 1778-1854, pp. 167-169 In September 1847, the legislature passed a law formally organizing the Kingdom's Judiciary Department.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 77. Prior to the construction of the Courthouse, the kingdom's highest court, known at that time as the \\"Superior Court\\", met in a government building located between Fort Street and Garden Lane in downtown Honolulu, near the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. The newspaper The Polynesian commented that this building was inadequate for the court, being \\"intolerably stuffy\\" and having conditions that made it difficult to find people willing to server as jurors. The newspaper also noted that the court building's wood construction did not provide adequate protection for the court's important records and documents. The Privy Council examined the possible relocation of the court between 1845 through 1851, looking at various locations in Honolulu. On May 20, 1850, a committee of privy councilors tasked with examining the issue recommended the construction of a new building that included both a courthouse and a new jail.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" pp. 77-78. However, due to difficulties in finding a suitable site, the Privy Council ultimately recommended to build the courthouse and jail separately, and proceeded with the construction of a new courthouse that could also provide a meeting location for the kingdom's legislature.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 79.  Design and construction  Watercolor painting of Queen Street, Honolulu in 1856. The Honolulu Courthouse is the white two-story building at right. Fort Kekuanohu is within the walled-off grounds in front of the courthouse. The site selected for the courthouse was along Queen Street near that road's intersection with Fort Street. The site was just south of Fort Kekuanohu (also known as Fort Honolulu), which at the time also served as the city's jailhouse and police headquarters.HHF Planners, \\"Walker Park Cultural Landscape Report,\\" p. 2-4. Construction commenced sometime in 1851. The construction utilized prison laborers, which brought about challenges. In October 1851, a group of about forty prisoners working on the project overpowered the guards who were supervising them, seized gun batteries overlooking the city, and attempted to open fire on nearby buildings.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 80. However, the prisoners lacked fire to set off the guns, and police officers were able to subdue the disturbance. The use of prison laborers also apparently led to delays and cost overruns. On April 14, 1852, the Minister of the Interior reported to the legislature that although the courthouse was \\"nearly completed,\\" the project was facing a delay due to the \\"miserable quality of the laborers employed, who have been, principally, the prisoners.\\" The minister noted that due to these delays, an additional appropriation would be required to complete the building. In a review of the kingdom's financial records, historian Richard Greer estimated that the cost of the courthouse was $34,229.50, which he described as a \\"very considerable sum for that time, and one which apparently justified the minister of the interior's strictures.\\" According to state statistician Robert C. Schmitt, the Courthouse probably had the first flush toilets in the Hawaiian Kingdom.  Government building: 1852-1874  The Superior Court held its first session at the new courthouse on July 5, 1852. Before beginning the session, Chief Justice William Little Lee dedicated the new building, the modern nature of which he contrasted with the thatched huts that the judiciary had used for hearings just a few years prior:Frost & Frost, Ali ªiolani Hale: A Century of Growth and Change, p. 6. Photograph of the northwest front of the Honolulu Courthouse, circa 1872. As completed, the courthouse was two stories tall, with dimensions of by , with a one-story classical-style portico at the building's entrance. The second story of the building did not extend through the entire building as the Superior Court's courtroom was a full two stories tall, measuring from floor to ceiling.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 81. This changed in 1853, when $1,200 was appropriated to extend the second story of the building over the courtroom to provide additional accommodations for the Legislature, though the space ended up being used by the Supreme Court, which superseded the Superior Court as the highest court in the kingdom.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 82. During the same decade, additional space was set aside to safeguard the records of the registrar of conveyances and a portion of the basement was converted into storage space for the collector of customs. Because the building also served as a meeting location for the kingdom's legislature, it was also called \\"Parliament House\\" and acted as the kingdom's capitol building. The hall in which the legislature met included a throne, overlain with an  ªahu  ªula, from which the king would open each legislative session. In addition to these government functions, the building also served as a gathering space for a variety of private and community activities, including meetings, concerts, plain and fancy dress balls, and church services.Frost & Frost, Ali ªiolani Hale: A Century of Growth and Change, p. 7. Notably, the courthouse hosted a ball to celebrate the wedding of King Kamehameha IV to Emma Rooke, who became Queen Emma. The courthouse was also the location where Queen's Hospital, named after Queen Emma, was formally established on May 25, 1859 during a meeting of its subscribers, presided over by King Kamehameha IV.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 83. = 1873 and 1874 elections and the 1874 courthouse riot = Gatling guns and soldiers in front of the Honolulu Courthouse during the riot that followed the election of David KalƒÅkaua as king in 1874. When King Kamehameha V died on December 11, 1872 without naming an heir, the kingdom's constitution provided that the selection of a new monarch fell to the kingdom's legislature. As the meeting location of the legislature, the legislature convened on January 8, 1873 at the courthouse to elect William Charles Lunalilo as the new king.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 84. Following Lunalilo's death on February 3, 1874, the legislature convened again at the courthouse on February 12, 1874, to elect a new monarch. Two candidates stood in the election: David KalƒÅkaua, who had also stood in the 1873 election, and Queen Emma, the widow of King Kamehameha IV.Frost & Frost, Ali ªiolani Hale: A Century of Growth and Change, p. 7. After the legislature elected KalƒÅkaua by a vote of 39 to 6, an angry mob of Queen Emma's supporters forced their way into the courthouse, attacked members of the legislature, and ransacked the building and its furnishings.Kneubuhl, Ali ªi≈çlani Hale: A Sentinel in Time, p. 33. Many books in the judiciary's law library and many valuable government records were lost in the riot. The riot badly damaged the courthouse, and while some sources report that the building was at least partially repaired, other sources state that the government chose to sell the building in lieu of repairing the damage. = Government functions move to Ali ªi≈çlani Hale = By the 1860s, the growing size of the kingdom's government caused a growing demand for office space. Government offices were spread out across a number of government-owned buildings, including the courthouse, as well as a number of rented offices throughout Honolulu.Kneubuhl, Ali ªi≈çlani Hale: A Sentinel in Time, p. 18. As the amount of money being spent on rent increased, the Privy Council began to again discuss the construction of a new government building to consolidate the kingdom's offices.Frost & Frost, Ali ªiolani Hale: A Century of Growth and Change, p. 7. In 1872, the kingdom laid the cornerstone of what would eventually become Ali ªi≈çlani Hale. Construction of the building was completed in 1874. The legislature moved out of the Honolulu Courthouse and into Ali ªi≈çlani Hale on April 30, 1874 and the Supreme Court followed on May 27 of the same year.Kneubuhl, Ali ªi≈çlani Hale: A Sentinel in Time, pp. 112-114.  Ownership by H. Hackfeld and Company and its successors: 1874-1968  Northwest front of the Old Courthouse as renovated by H. Hackfeld and Company. Note the removal of the portico and the addition of a cast- and wrought-iron gateway. A portion of the company's headquarters is visible to the right of the gate. After the legislature and judiciary moved out of the Old Courthouse, the Hawaiian Kingdom put the building up for sale. On September 19, 1874, the building was purchased at auction by H. Hackfeld and Company for $20,000, the auction's upset price.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 85. Upon taking possession of the building, H. Hackfeld and Company gutted and rebuilt the building's interior to serve as the company's headquarters. The company also used the building as a warehouse for groceries and feed and as a steamship agent's office. Between 1885 and 1891, a new addition was added to the rear of the building.Greer, \\"The Old Court House on Queen Street,\\" p. 85-87. In 1899, H. Hackfeld and Company constructed a new building next door to the Old Courthouse to serve as its new headquarters and erected a cast- and wrought-iron gateway between the Old two buildings.HHF Planners, \\"Walker Park Cultural Landscape Report,\\" p. 2-8. Each half of the gate bore medallions with the left gate baring the number \\"49,\\" representing the year the company was founded (1849), and the right gate bearing the number \\"99,\\" representing the year the company celebrated its fiftieth anniversary (1899). At around the same time the gate was erected, the company removed the building's front portico. Although H. Hackfeld and Company moved into the new headquarters next door in 1903, the company, and its successors, continued to use the Old Courthouse for office and warehouse space until 1968.  Demolition  The cast- and wrought-iron gateway and coral blocks from the Old Courthouse on display at Walker Park in Honolulu. In February 1968, Amfac announced plans to demolish the Old Courthouse to make way for a new high-rise office complex. Although Amfac indicated the building could not stay at its current location, it stated it would be willing to donate the Old Courthouse and provide up to $25,000 to dismantle and reconstruct it at another location. After the announcement, there was movement among preservationists to try to preserve the building. In March 1968, the State of Hawaii's Historic Buildings Task Force proposed that Amfac swap the 25,000 square foot parcel on which the courthouse stood with an adjacent 21,000 square foot parcel, which was owned by the City and County of Honolulu and used as a park. Under this proposed deal, the courthouse would be preserved at its existing location. The deal also gave Amfac the right to develop the area above Fort Street Mall, a pedestrian mall that separated the city park from the land on which the company's 1903 headquarters stood. However, Amfac stated that it had previously considered such a land swap and decided not to pursue it because it would \\"destroy the effectiveness of the Fort Street Mall.\\" In addition to the proposal from the task force, the state government also studied the feasibility of moving the Old Courthouse building to the Honolulu Civic Center. The State's comptroller noted that  ªIolani Barracks had been moved, brick by brick, in a similar fashion to the grounds of  ªIolani Palace at a cost of $250,000. Despite the interest in saving the building, Amfac announced in December 1968 that no organization had submitted a plan to take possession of the Old Courthouse and the company commenced with the demolition of the building on December 28, 1968. However, Amfac also announced that it would preserve some of the coral blocks that made up the building's structure and would donate the blocks to the state's Historic Buildings Task Force. Amfac also preserved stone blocks that made up the sidewalk adjacent to the courthouse, which had been constructed from ballast brought to Hawaii on sailing ships. At the time of the Old Courthouse's demolition, it was the oldest government building standing in Honolulu.Old Honolulu: A Guide to Oahu's Historic Buildings, entry no. 48 Several artifacts from the Old Courthouse are displayed at Walker Park, a small park next to the office complex that was constructed at the site of the courthouse, including two coral blocks used in the building's construction and the cast- and wrought- iron gateway that stood next to the courthouse.HHF Planners, \\"Walker Park Cultural Landscape Report,\\" pp. 2-36 and 2-37.

It offers courses on pilot training, aircraft maintenance, and cabin crew management, among others. It is one of the oldest aviation academies in the country. Location Originally based in Chennai, the Madras Flying Club is based at Gate No. 1 at Tiruchirappalli International Airport in Tiruchi since 2019. History The Madras Flying Club was established in Madras in October 1929 by a pilot named G. Vlasto. It commenced on 19 November 1929 with a meeting at the Madras Guards Institute on Poonamallee High Road. In the meeting, which was presided over by Chitty, W/Cdr. A. Cooper, the then Secretary of the Aero Club of India, addressed the gathering announcing the formation of a new flying club at Madras with the financial grant from the Director of Civil Aviation. The flying club was incorporated on 4 March 1930, and, with the subsidy for commencing flying programs granted in April 1930, the flying club was formally inaugurated on 20 August 1930 by Sir George Frederick Stanley, the then Governor of Madras, who was also the first patron of the flying club. With F/Lt. H. N. Hawker as the first pilot instructor and M. W. Hulcoop as the first flight engineer, the first instructional flight took place on 21 July 1930. The first two aircraft, VCT-ABH and VT-ABI, were named by Lady Beatrix Stanley as \\"Garuda\\" and \\"Pushpak\\", respectively. After Independence, under the president-ship of Jawaharlal Nehru, the flying club celebrated its silver jubilee in October 1955. On 12 September 2009, the flying club celebrated its 80th anniversary. In November 2018, the flying club announced shifting its operations from the Chennai International Airport to the Tiruchi International Airport. The flying club Beginning with the initial fleet of the Puss Moths, Tiger Moths, and Chipmunks, and then to Pushpak, the modern fleet of the flying club include the glass-cockpit Cessna 172 R.

In its first 90 years of operations, the flying club has produced more than 1,500 pilots. The Tamil Nadu government has allotted two acres of land adjoining the Tiruchi airport for the development of the flying club's infrastructure. In 2020, the flying club collaborated with Bishop Heber College in Tiruchi to offer aviation-related degree and diploma courses to be awarded by the Bharathidasan University.

Family Stephen was born into the so-called Ders branch of the gens (clan) B≈ë, which originated from Somogy County, and was one of the ancient ethnic Hungarian kindreds which had participated in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in late 9th century. His father was a certain Ders, whose parentage is unknown. Stephen had an unidentified sister. Although Stephen originated from a relatively less significant branch of the B≈ë clan, his sister married Gregory II Monoszl√≥, a prominent landowner in Southern Transdanubia and Slavonia. The marriage resulted the rapid political and social grow of Stephen's two sons Michael and Peter \\"the Toothed\\" by the end of the 14th century, as their cousins were the influential barons Egyed, Gregory III and prelate Peter Monoszl√≥. When the latter became Bishop of Transylvania, Michael B≈ë was made as his grand provost. Subsequently, he served as Bishop of Zagreb, then Archbishop of Esztergom. Peter functioned as Count of the Sz√©kelys. Career Stephen was referred to as curialis comes of Somogy County in 1266, a precursor office of the position vice-isp√°n (de facto administrator of the county). He served in this capacity, when Mojs held the dignity of isp√°n. Considering Stephen acted as his familiaris, historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs argued Stephen was curialis comes until 1267, when Mojs was replaced by Lawrence, son of Kem√©ny. Sz≈±cs also argued Stephen was one of the four noble judges () in Somogy County since the early 1260s. Following King B√©la IV and his son Duke Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the \\"royal servants\\", from then on known as noblemen in their Decree of 1267, the isp√°n (head) of Somogy County, Lawrence was commissioned to review the ownership of several possessions in the county, as one of the articles of the Decree of 1267 ordained that \\"the lands of the nobles, which thou art ours, the peoples of the queen's free villages, or the courtiers, or the castle folks, are occupied or kept occupied under any pretext, must be returned to these nobles\\". The assembly of Somogy County delegated five local nobles to the ad-litem court chaired by Lawrence, including Stephen B≈ë, along with, for instance, his distant relative John B≈ë. Throughout the year 1268, the six-member commission performed the task. Stephen died shortly thereafter.

South Korea became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to recognize independence of Uzbekistan on December 1991. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on January 1992. Bilateral relations have grown steadily since that time. Cooperation between the two nations has grown in political, economic, and educational spheres. History Uzbek President Islam Karimov, Karimov's wife (right) and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, 11 February 2010 South Korea and Uzbekistan formally established diplomatic relations in January 1992. Soon thereafter South Korea opened its embassy in Tashkent, and Uzbekistan opened its embassy in Seoul. Uzbek president Islam Karimov has made eight official visits to South Korea, in 1992, 1995, 1999, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2015. During his visit to South Korea in 2006, Karimov was awarded the title of 'Honorary Citizen of Seoul' by then mayor of Seoul Lee Myung-bak. In 1992, South Korean president Kim Young-sam visited Uzbekistan. In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun visted Uzbekistan. His successor, Lee Myung-bak, visited Uzbekistan twice in 2009 and 2011. President Park Geun-hye visited Uzbekistan in 2014 where she and President Karimov signed several agreements to strengthen economic and investment cooperation and technology exchange between the two countries. In 2017, Karimov's successor Shavkat Mirziyoyev visited South Korea for a four- day visit, where he met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. At a ceremony of a South Korea-Uzbekistan business forum, a wide range of issues on bilateral agenda were discussed including the prospects for further development of interstate relations in political, trade-economic, financial- investment, scientific-technical, cultural-humanitarian and other spheres, exchange views on regional and international issues. During his visit, Mirziyoyev was also awarded the title of 'Honorary Citizen of Seoul' by mayor Park Won-soon. In 2019, President Moon Jae-in visited Uzbekistan on a four-day state visit, where he met with President Miriziyoyev. Including discussions on advancing bilateral ties, President Moon addressed the joint session of Oliy Majlis and attended the opening ceremony of the House of Korean Culture and Art in Tashkent. Economic relations Uzbekistan is South Korea's largest trading partner in Central Asia. Following the 2005 Andijan unrest, which led to United States and European Union placing trade and economic sanctions against Uzbekistan, South Korea along with China, Japan and Russia continued economic and trade relations with Uzbekistan, with no demands on human rights. In 2006, South Korea and Uzbekistan signed a declaration on strategic partnership, which they agreed to develop and deepen further in a new Joint Declaration signed during President Park Geun-hye‚Äôs visit to Tashkent in 2014. During President Karimov's visit to South Korea in 2015, 60 documents relating to trade, investment, economic and technical cooperation and other spheres were signed, at a total worth of US$ 7.7 billion. In 2015, bilateral trade turnover between the countries exceeded US$ 1.7 billion, corresponding to 50 percent of South Korea‚Äôs trade with Central Asian republics. In 2009, Korean Air Cargo took over the management of Navoi International Airport and, under the 10-year development plan, further accelerated the modernization program. Construction of the largest air cargo terminal in Central Asia that can handle 100,000 tonnes of cargo annually using latest equipment. In August 2010, Hanjin Group, the parent of Korean Air, inaugurated the cargo terminal at Navoi, which now serves as the intercontinental logistics center from Central Asia. South Korea has been active in numerous projects and programs in different regions of Uzbekistan, including the free economic zones at Navoi and Angren. On 2016, South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn visited Uzbekistan, where he joined then Prime Minister of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev in the inauguration of the largest bilateral cooperation project, the Ustyurt Gas Chemical Complex in Karakalpakstan. The cost of the project was US$ 4 billon. South Korea and Uzbekistan also founded the joint venture LG CNS Uzbekistan on 2015, to support the implementation of information systems and databases for E-Government in order to facilitate the mobility of people, business and government system in Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan and South Korea have also agreed on training programs, under which thousands of representatives of Uzbek small and medium-size businesses annually work and receive training in Korean enterprises and companies. Cultural/educational relations Uzbekistan has invited South Korean experts to take positions as deputy minister in the ministry for development of information technologies and communications, as well vice rectors at several universities. In 2014, South Korea‚Äôs Inha University opened a branch in Tashkent, which focuses on computer sciences and high-tech engineering and gives all courses in English. Yeoju Institute of Technology opened the Yeoju Technical Institute in Tashkent, which became the first private university in Uzbekistan. Courses include areas as architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, alternative energy, business management, tourism, international marketing, international economic relations, primary education, Korean language philology, and aesthetics and dresses‚Äô design. In 2019, during President Moon Jae-in's visit to Uzbekistan, the Korean Culture and Art House was opened in Tashkent. There are Korean Cultural Centers in Uzbek cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and Nukus. Koryo- saram In the late 1930s thousands of Koreans in the Soviet Union were deported to Central Asia, supposedly to prevent further Japanese espionage. These people are now known as Koryo-sarams. It is estimated that 177,270 ethnic Koreans still live in the territory of Uzbekistan, making it largest in Central Asia and the fifth largest in the world, after Canada, Japan, China, and the U.S. The presence of these ethnic Koreans helps to strengthen ties between the two countries. A monument honoring the Koryo-saram on the 80th anniversary of their deportation from the Soviet Far East to Uzbek SSR was unveiled at Seoul Park in Tashkent. The monument was established by the Korea Culture Association and the Overseas Koreans Foundation in Uzbekistan. The unveiling ceremony of the monument was attended by mayor of Seoul Park Won- soon and mayor of Tashkent Rakhmonbek Usmanov.

Seafaring is especially important in the Caribbean as it represents the only possibility in reaching the Caribbean Islands. Current research has discovered that numerous Pre- Columbian colonisation events occurred in the Caribbean and that an important initial incentive to visit the Caribbean Islands may have been the search for high quality materials, such as flint, clams and oysters and other resources. Although only a limited amount of Pre-Columbian watercraft have been uncovered it has been possible to deduce the appearance and design of some Caribbean canoes. Historical sources offer a plethora of descriptions regarding the appearance and use of Amerindian canoes, however, it is difficult to assess to what extent the Caribbean canoes from the 15th century AD are similar to their counterparts around 5000 years earlier.  Difficulties of prehistoric seafaring  Islands in and near the Caribbean The sea has enabled increased human mobility and interaction over the past thousands of years. This is especially true in the Caribbean, where seafaring represents the only possibility to reach the Caribbean Islands from the mainland. The Caribbean Islands are commonly grouped into the Greater Antilles and Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. Geographically, the Caribbean Sea is bounded by two archipelagoes ‚Äì the Greater Antilles to the north and the Lesser Antilles to the east ‚Äì and by northern South America to the south and the North American continent to the west. Prehistoric seafaring is a difficult topic to understand, regardless of the geographic region, because of the lack of ethnographic or ethnohistoric records, and the lack of archaeological sources. Prehistoric seafaring artefacts, such as canoes and canoe paddles were constructed of wood and thus often degraded over time, leaving no evidence of their original appearance, design and construction method. However, the presence of similar archaeological artefacts in different regions, separated by bodies of water, proves that contact through seafaring existed.  Pre- colonial human dispersal models in the Caribbean  The geographic formation of the Caribbean Islands resembles an arc of scattered stepping stones with end points close to North, Central and South America. This has inevitably raised questions regarding timing, pattern and tempo of human dispersal in the Caribbean, which has been a topic of debate for more than a century. Due to the close proximity of numerous Caribbean Islands to each other, first interpretations of Pre-Columbian seafaring and migration were based on a stepping-stone model. This model stated that human groups entered the islands close to the mainland, after which people moved to other islands increasingly distant from the continental landmasses. Current research tends to move away from the stepping-stone model in favour of the southward route hypothesis. The southward route hypothesis proposes that the northern Antilles were settled directly from South America followed by progressively southward movements into the Lesser Antilles. This hypothesis has been supported by both radiocarbon dates and seafaring simulations.  Earliest settled islands  The first Caribbean island to have been settled was Trinidad, where the earliest archaeological finds date from 8000 BCE. Given the lower sea levels in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene it is likely that Trinidad was close enough to the South American mainland to allow settlement that would not have necessarily required a watercraft. Thus the early migration of Trinidad should be considered differently when compared to the migration of other Caribbean Islands. With the help of radiocarbon dating Napolitano and colleagues (2019) have discovered two distinct clusters of Caribbean colonisation, from ca. 3850-550 BCE and 150-1450 AD. The first cluster represents two distinct population dispersals between 3850 and 550 BCE. Within this time frame the earliest settled islands are Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico in the Greater Antilles; Guadeloupe, Sint Maarten, Vieques, Saint Thomas, Barbuda, Antigua and Montserrat in the northern Lesser Antilles; Barbados and Grenada in the southern Lesser Antilles; and Aruba, Bonaire, Cura√ßao and Tobago, which are located in close proximity to the South American mainland. Further radiocarbon dates that were not used in the study by Napolitano and colleagues suggest that Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Mona Island in the Greater Antilles; Anguila, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Marie-Galante and Martinique in the northern Lesser Antilles; and Margarita, Coche Island and Cubagua in the southern Lesser Antilles were also colonised in the time period from ca. 3850-550 BCE. Early paleoenvironmental evidence including evidence of man-made fires from numerous Caribbean Islands has shown that by approximately 3190 BCE many if not all islands in the Lesser Antilles up to Antigua were being visited, if not settled.  Second cluster of colonisation  The second cluster of colonisation occurred between 150 and 1450 AD and represents a period in which Jamaica in the Greater Antilles and several islands in the northern Lesser Antilles, namely Saint John, Saint Eustatius, and Saint Lucia and Carriacou in the southern Lesser Antilles were colonised. This time frame also reflects multiple groups moving in various directions simultaneously, which is an expected outcome considering a logical increase in trade and exchange relationships. The available data suggests that, especially during the first colonisation cluster, communities managed extensive subsistence and resource systems, likely guided by seasonality and intensive voyaging systems between islands and the mainland. Sea-based connection emerged between communities, which resulted in the development of social networks. In recent years experimental canoe voyages, network analysis of interactions between island communities and global seafaring modeling have been used to shed new light on this topic.  Incentives for travelling  One initial incentive to travel from the mainland to the islands may have been the search for high quality materials. For example, Flinty Bay on Antigua is one of the best known sources of high quality flint in the Lesser Antilles. Flint from Antigua has been discovered on many other Caribbean Islands, which highlights the importance of this material during the Pre-Columbian period but also shows that many islands were connected to each other, at least through trade. A Flint tool from around 5000 BCE found in Pl√∂√ünitz, Germany. Pre-Columbian flint tools will have looked similar. Plum Piece on Saba is an example of an archaeological site that was visited seasonally in order to make use of local resources. At Plum Piece abundant remains of black crab (Gecarciunus ruricola) and Audubon's shearwater (Pfuffinus pfuffinus) were found in midden deposits. Three radiocarbon dates from the midden deposits have placed the site between 1875 and 1520 BCE. The breeding season of the Audubon's shearwater coincides with the spawning period of the black crab, between February and July. Furthermore, the tropical soils near the site provide good conditions for growing roots and crops, while numerous plants make the area well-suited for gathering nuts and seeds. It is possible that Plum Piece was visited in alternation with comparable campsites on nearby islands in a yearly mobility cycle determined by the seasonality and availability of resources. Pre-worked flint cores from Antigua have also been found on Saba, furthermore confirming the importance of this resource for the Caribbean Islands. 278x278px A similar archaeological site has been uncovered at Spanish Water, Cura√ßao. At Spanish Water 14 shell deposits have been found in three different locations. Twelve shell and four radiocarbon samples point to an occupation and/or use of the site between 2900 BCE to 1650 AD. The numerous shell deposits have been interpreted as collecting and processing camps of various mangrove clams and oysters species. Investigations at Spanish Water have discovered that the meat recovered from the clams and oysters was not consumed directly but conserved to be exported. Combining voyaging models with the aforementioned archaeological data has resulted in a better understanding of seafaring routes. For example, with the aid of voyaging models, it was determined that the quickest and safest period to travel from Plum Piece to Long Island was in July. For the return voyage from Long Island to Plum Piece it was determined that during January it would take the least amount of time. However, these models have also uncovered that a combination of pathways rather than direct island-to-island travel initially defined Pre-Columbian seafaring.  Pre-Columbian canoes  The main evidence of Pre-Columbian seafaring is the presence of ceramics and other artefacts such as flint tools on Caribbean Islands. Very few archaeological examples of prehistoric Caribbean watercraft have been uncovered. The few cases of watercraft that have been found are dugouts constructed from a single log. There are several families of trees that could have been used to construct Caribbean canoes. These include woods of the mahogany family (Meliaceae) such as the Cuban mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), that can reach heights of 30-35 m, the ceiba family (Malvacae) such as Ceiba pentandra, than can grow up to 60-70 m tall and the cedar family such as the Red Cedar (Cedrela odorata) that can grow up to 60 m in height. It is likely that these canoes were built in a variety of sizes. Ranging from fishing canoes, holding one or a few individuals, to larger ones able to carry as many as a few dozen people that could have been used to reach the Caribbean Islands from the mainland. Reports by historical chroniclers claim to have witnessed a canoe \\"containing 40 to 50 Caribs [...] when it came out to trade with a visiting English ship\\". During Columbus' first voyage he summarised the appearance and use of canoes: > \\"They have in all these islands very many canoes like our row-boats; some > larger, some smaller, but most of them larger than a barge of eighteen > seats. They are not so wide, because they are made of one simple piece of > timber, but a barge could not keep up with them in rowing because they go > with incredible speed, and with these canoes they navigate among these > islands, which are innumerable, and carry on their traffic. I have seen in > some of these canoes seventy and eighty men, each with his oar\\". Even if Columbus' descriptions are accurate they represent Caribbean canoes during the 15th century AD. It is difficult to assess to what extent Caribbean canoes from this period were comparable to their counterparts 5000 years earlier. Similar to canoes, only limited archaeological evidence exists concerning paddles. McKusick provides a basic description of Caribbean paddles: > \\"Their paddles have a handle like a spade, with a small crosspiece of wood > across the top. This is held with one hand while the other hand grasps the > paddle near the blade, the latter being 2.5 feet long. They paddle very > differently than we row for they face the bow, pushing the water behind to > drive the pirogue ahead\\". An early 20th century canoe from South America. Although not identical to Pre- Columbian Caribbean canoes they will have shared similarities. Due to the small number of recovered precolonial Caribbean paddles it cannot be stated with certainty how they were used. However, a repeated use of different paddles has been observed amongst Pacific Islanders, which may have been similar in the Caribbean. In general, paddles used in still water or less turbid rivers were typically shorter, while paddles used in open water were of a sharp bladed pattern, allowing rapid strokes to achieve maximum speed. These is still much dispute regarding the use of sails in Caribbean canoes. Some archaeologists doubt that oceanic transportation would have been possible without the use of sails as winds and currents would have carried the canoes off course. However, no evidence of a sail or a Caribbean canoe that could have made use of a sail has been found. Furthermore, no historical sources mention Caribbean canoes with sails. One possibility could be that canoes with sails were initially used in the Caribbean but later abandoned before European contact. This, however, seems unlikely, as long-distance trade continued in the Caribbean even after the European colonisation of the islands. Hence, it is likely that early Caribbean colonists made use of canoes without sails.

Al-Muhannad 'ala al-Mufannad (), also known as al-Tasdiqat li-Daf' al-Talbisat (), was subsequently published in Urdu as 'Aqa'id 'Ulama' Ahl al-Sunna Deoband (The Beliefs of the Sunni Scholars of Deoband) is a book that expresses some of the beliefs held by the Sunni Hanafi Deobandis. It was authored by the Indian Hanafi-Maturidi hadith scholar and Sufi master Khalil Ahmad al-Saharanpuri (d. 1346/1927), who wrote a commentary on Sunan Abi Dawud, entitled Badhl al-Majhud. The book is not an independent book on creed, but rather a compilation of questions and answers which were asked by the Arab scholars at that time. These questions were sent to the Deobandi scholars by Husain Ahmad al-Madani, who was living in Medina, so Saharanpuri responded and answered them, and then these questions and answers were compiled into a book and were printed under the name of al-Muhannad 'ala al-Mufannad. Since most of these questions were related to beliefs, and in the correct jargon, were related to the branches which pertain to beliefs and the science of Kalam, it became published under the title of Mabahith fi 'Aqa'id Ahl al-Sunna ().  Summary  The text succinctly summarizes Deobandi perspectives on a range of controversial issues, such as: the ruling on Wahhabis, the ruling on celebrating Prophet Muhammad's birth (al-Mawlid al- Nabawi), whether the Deobandis believe it commendable to visit the Prophet Muhammad's grave (they do, according to Saharanpuri), whether intercession (tawassul) through the Prophet or saints is permissible (it is, so long as one understands the power to intercede comes from God), whether the Prophet is living in his grave (he is), whether it is permissible to send salutations to the Prophet (it is), whether any part of creation is better than the Prophet (it is not), whether the Prophet is the seal of the Prophets (he is), and the possibility of the occurrence of lying or reneging on a promise, among other topics and issues that were raised by various sects of Islam towards Deobandi scholars.

Based on a passage in front of its host star (transit) the radius is 1.6 times the radius of Jupiter. The light curve during the transit revealed that the star itself is larger and cooler at its equator than at the poles, making the poles of the star appear brighter. Adding to this asymmetry is the fact that the orbit of WASP-189 b is highly inclined; it passes close to the star's poles.

History The area occupied by the street lay outside the walls of Roman Eboracum, but evidence of occupation in this period has been found, and it is possible that a minor Roman road ran along it route. During the Anglo-Saxon and Viking Jorvik period, the area appears to have been abandoned. Gillygate was first recorded in the 12th- century, at which time the church of St Giles, Gillygate, which gives the street its name, lay on the north-west side. The south-east side was largely gardens owned by St Leonard's Hospital, but was gradually becoming built up with houses. In 1354, the street was placed under the jurisdiction of the city of York. By 1401, a chapel dedicated to St Antony existed on the street, but this was replaced by St Antony's Hospital by 1420 and became a private house in 1558. St Giles Church was demolished in the 16th-century, although burials in its graveyard continued into the following century, and the north-west side of the street remained large open fields in the 17th-century. Some small-scale industry existed in this period, including stone and coal yards, a smithy, and a clay pipe manufacturer. While Gillygate lies just north-west of the York city walls, unlike elsewhere on their circuit, the buildings screening the wall have not been cleared, and so can only be occasionally glimpsed from the street. In 1972, Nikolaus Pevsner described the street as \\"a run-down Georgian Street with two interesting houses\\", these being 3-5 and 26-28 Gillygate. It is now a street with predominately independent shops. In 2013, the City of York Council claimed that \\"over the last 30 years, the quality of shops and businesses here has risen generally\\". However, it forms part of the city's inner ring road, and has heavy traffic. Layout and architecture View north-west along Gillygate Gillygate starts at a junction with Bootham, opposite Queen Margaret's Arch, through which Exhibition Square can be accessed. The junction is close to Bootham Bar and St Leonard's Place. The street runs north-east, with several junctions on its north-west side, leading to Millers Yard, St Giles Yard, St Giles Gate and Portland Street, before ending at a junction with Lord Mayor's Walk, Clarence Street and Claremont Terrace. Notable buildings on the north-west side of the street include 3-5 Gillygate, built in 1797 by Thomas Wolstenholme; early 19th-century buildings at 9, 11, 13, 19 and 21 Gillygate; 18th-century houses at 23 and 25 Gillygate; more early-19th century buildings at 59, 61, 65, 67, 69, 71 and 73 Gillygate; and the Salvation Army Citadel. On the south-east side lie early 18th-century houses at 12 and 16-20 Gillygate; 26-28 Gillygate, built in 1769 by Robert Clough; the late 18th-century 38-40 Gillygate; 42-44 Gillygate, of the early 19th-century; 50‚Äì52, 58 and 62, all of the 18th-century; 64 Gillygate, the oldest building on the street, with 17th-century origins; then more late 18th- century houses at 66, 68 and 68a, 70, and 82 Gillygate; and the early-19th century 84 and 86 Gillygate.

He was a lawyer of the workers and peasants of the CNT, later becoming part of the trentista current - first joining the Federal Democratic Republican Party and later the Syndicalist Party. Biography Benito Pab√≥n y Su√°rez de Urbina was born in Seville, on March 25, 1895, into a wealthy family. His father, Benito Pab√≥n y Galindo, was an Integrist, and his mother, Teresa Su√°rez de Urbina y Ca√±averal, was a Carlist. His uncle Jos√© Ignacio Su√°rez de Urbina was a prominent Catholic publicist and leader of the Traditionalist Communion in C√≥rdoba. In his youth, Benito was also a member of the Carlist cause and was part of the Jaimista Youth of Villanueva del R√≠o. Benito later studied with the Jesuits and at the Law Institute of Seville, then went on to work as a labor lawyer in Granada, Zaragoza and Madrid. =Second Republic= During the time of the Second Spanish Republic, he led the defense of various cases related to workers' causes. As a lawyer, Pab√≥n defended the farmers implicated in the Casas Viejas incident, as well as those jailed after the anarchist insurrection of January 1933. In the 1936 Spanish general election he was elected deputy of Zaragoza, with 44,545 votes out of the 85,178 cast, running as an independent.

History The street has the main route leading south and west from York from the Roman Eboracum era onwards; the Roman roads to Calcaria and Isurium ran parallel to the modern road, to the rear of the buildings on its north-western side. While the area was initially agricultural, it was later used as a rubbish dump, and then as a cemetery. Remains of several tombs have been found. By the 5th-century, it appears to have been used as agricultural land once more. The street was first recorded in the early-13th century, as Ploxswaingate, named for the ploughswains living in the area, and by 1282, 29 plots along the street had already been built upon. Unlike other streets in Mediaeval York, it was extremely wide, and as a result, a horse and cattle market was held on it. By 1639, there were 68 houses on the street, and although there was some damage during the 1644 Siege of York, the presence of a nearby Royalist camp meant it was the only suburb of the city to escape complete destruction. From the Mediaeval period, the street was known for its inns, mixed with smaller merchants' houses and farmhouses belonging to people who put cows out to pasture on the Knavesmire. Barstow's Hospital was built in the 17th-century, and from the 1820s, it became built up with larger houses and shops. The last horse fair on the street was held in about 1906, by which time it had become an important tram and bus route. It is now a mixed commercial area, with shops, restaurants, hotels and some housing, although it is dominated by traffic. Layout and architecture Looking north-east on Blossom Street The street is the continuation of Micklegate. It runs south-west from Micklegate Bar, through a major crossroads with Queen Street and Nunnery Lane. On its south-east side are several terraced streets: St Mary's Court, South Parade, Moss Street and Shaw's Terrace; while only The Crescent leads off its north- west side. Past its junction with Holgate Road and East Mount Road, it continues as The Mount. Notable buildings on the north-east side include the Windmill Hotel, with 17th-century origins; 22-26 Blossom Street, built in 1789 by John Horner, which served for much of the 20th-century as the York Railwaymen's Club; and the Everyman Cinema, designed by Harry Weedon in 1936. On the south-west side lie the Bar Convent, the oldest Catholic convent in England; 19 Blossom Street, dating from 1760, but with some earlier material; and the Bay Horse Inn, dating back to at least the 17th-century.

Traveset is a Research Professor at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies ‚Äì IMEDEA (CSIC-UIB) (Catalan: Institut Mediterrani d'Estudis Avan√ßats; Spanish: Instituto Mediterr√°neo de Estudios Avanzados) based in Mallorca, and Collaborating Professor at the University of the Balearic Islands (Catalan: Universitat de les Illes Balears, UIB; Spanish: Universidad de las Islas Baleares). In 2017, she received the Rey Jaime I Award for Environmental Protection (Rey Jaime I Awards Foundation). Furthermore, she currently holds the position of Institutional Representative of the CSIC in the Balearic Islands. Her research focuses on the study of ecological and evolutionary interactions between species, specifically on how these are altered by different drivers of global change. She has also carried out many studies on the reproductive biology of vulnerable or threatened plant species. She stands out for the significant contributions she has made in the knowledge and understanding of biodiversity in insular ecosystems. Her fieldwork is mainly focused on the Balearic Islands, although she also coordinates projects in the Canary Islands, Berlengas, Galapagos, and Seychelles and participates in others in the Ogasawara Archipelago (Japan), and in mainland Europe (Sweden, Germany, Belgium), and North America (Mexico).  Education  Traveset received her Bachelor of Biology from the University of Barcelona (UB). She did her Master's thesis at UB, under the direction of Professor Ram√≥n Margalef, on the taxonomy and ecology of freshwater sponges. She obtained her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (USA), where she began working on the subject of plant-animal interactions, doing field work in Guanacaste National Park (Costa Rica). After returning to Spain, she did postdoctoral work at the Estaci√≥n Biol√≥gica de Do√±ana (Do√±ana Biological Station) from 1990 to 1991, before moving to IMEDEA in Mallorca in 1992.  Professional appointments  She began her professional career in the Spanish National Research Council (Spanish: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, CSIC) in 1995 as an Associate Researcher. In 2001 she was promoted to the position of Scientific Researcher, a position she held until 2006, when she became a Research Professor at the Institution. She has led the laboratory of Terrestrial Ecology at IMEDEA since 2000. From 2002 to 2004 she was the Spanish representative of the LINKECOLhttp://archives.esf.org/coordinating-research/research-networking- programmes/life-earth-and-environmental-sciences-lee/completed-esf-research- networking-programmes-in-life-earth-and-environmental-sciences/linking- community-and-ecosystem-ecology-linkecol/science-meetings/linkecol-final- conference.html (Linking Community and Ecosystem Ecology) Program of the European Science Foundation (ESF). From 2006 to 2014 she belonged to the International Committee for Science (IUBS). In the period 2010‚Äì2014 she was a member of the Panel \\"Evolutionary, Population and Environmental Biology\\" of the Advanced Research Grants of the European Research Council (ERC). In 2012‚Äì2013 she belonged to the Evaluation Committee of the Research Activity (CNEAI), and from 2014 to 2018 she was appointed National Research Panel officer, Biodiversity, Ecology and Global Change Program of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science. Since 2017 she has belonged to the Committee of the Life Area of CSIC. In 2019 she entered the Advisory Committee of the NGO Initiative pour les Petites √éles de M√©diterran√©e.  Research  Her main line of research is the ecology and evolution of ecological interactions between plants and animals on islands, although many of her works are relevant also for the understanding of continental ecosystems. She also participates in mainland projects, both in Europe and America. Her research focuses mainly on the Balearic Islands, but she has also coordinated projects in other archipelagos such as the Canary Islands, Berlengas, Galapagos or Seychelles, oceanic islands that are important hotspots of biodiversity. Her most significant contributions have been in the field of pollination and seed dispersal, and she has also worked with plant-herbivore antagonistic interactions, with the ultimate interest of understanding how these interactions help maintain community biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. By using the network theory approach, her work has contributed to unveil the impact of global change -specifically biological invasions, habitat loss, and climate change- on native communities. She collaborates in various projects with researchers from different Spanish and foreign institutions and has published c. 300 papers and book chapters with researchers from more than 30 countries. Together with her colleague David Mark Richardson from Stellenbosch University (South Africa), she has edited the book Plant Invasions: The Role of Biotic Interactions, published by CABI in 2020.

The artwork, which depicts a skeletal police officer, sold for $35 million at Christie's in May 2017. It is currently Basquiat's sixth highest auction record, and his seventh most expensive painting.  History  Jean-Michel Basquiat painted La Hara in 1981, a pivotal moment when he transitioned from street artist to an art world sensation. He began working in the basement of Annina Nosei's gallery in SoHo where La Hara was executed. Basquiat's paintings from 1981 and 1982 are his most valuable. His top ten auction prices for paintings are from those two years. La Hara is one of the few works of white men painted by Basquiat. The artwork depicts a menacing white skeletal figure wearing a peaked cap against a red background. Basquiat incorporates vivid colors and diagrams throughout the painting. The word \\"LA HARA\\" is written multiple times on the left side of the figure. Drawing from his Puerto Rican culture, la hara derives from the Nuyorican term la jara, slang for police, which is a play on the Irish surname O'Hara. O'Hara was considered a common surname for New York police officers during the 1940s and 1950s. The bottom of the painting is gray with steel jail cell bars. The painting first appeared at auction when it sold at Sotheby's for $341,000 in 1989. It was later sold privately to American businessman and art collector Steve Cohen. The artwork sold for $35 million at Christie's post-war and contemporary art auction in May 2017, which exceeded the pre-sale estimate of $28 million.  Exhibitions  La Hara has been exhibited at major galleries and art institutions around the world, which include: * Avanguadria Transavanguardia on the Aurelian Walls (from Porta Metronia to Porta Latina) in Rome, Italy, April‚ÄìJuly 1982. * Jean-Michel Basquiat: Peinture, dessin, √©criture at Mus√©e-Galerie de la Seita in Paris, France, 1993. * Summer Exhibition at Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York, June‚ÄìAugust 1996. * The Jean- Michel Basquiat Show at Fondazione La Triennale di Milano in Italy, September 2006‚ÄìJanuary 2007. * Basquiat at Fondation Beyeler in Switzerland, May‚ÄìSeptember 2010; Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, October 2010‚ÄìJanuary 2011. * Jean-Michel Basquiat at Gagosian Gallery in New York, February‚ÄìApril 2013. * Jean-Michel Basquiat: Now's the Time at Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, Canada, February‚ÄìApril 2015. * Basquiat's 'Defacement': The Untold Story at Guggenheim Museum in New York, June‚ÄìNovember 2019.

The studio albums are the US release versions, as \\"Tears of a Clown\\", \\"Ranking Full Stop\\", \\"Too Nice to Talk To\\" and \\"Hit It\\" weren't included on the original UK releases of their respective albums.

Ray Sidman for Goldmine gave it a 4/5, saying that \\"there are a few songs in the bunch that are subpar or worse, as would be expected of any performer, but overall, The English Beat built a solid New Wave oeuvre\\". \\"The set‚Äôs packaging is simple but attractive and sturdy\\" with a \\"well-written, 24-page booklet by Alex Ogg that provides a history of band\\"and \\"though there are no previously unreleased songs here, many of the rarities are receiving a CD release for the first time with this set\\". Reviewing for Rolling Stone magazine, Jody Rosen gave the box set 4.5/5 and said that it \\"features the band's three great studio albums, plus terrific bonus tracks and dub versions, and a slew of live recordings in which the Beat unleash their dance-floor fury and their Thatcher-era protest politics.\\" Stephen Deusner for Paste magazine gave the box set 9.1/10 and concluded that the live tracks are the \\"most compelling, if only because it takes them out of the relatively hermetic environment of the studio and puts them in front of an audience.

She is currently Assistant Programme Officer at RTHK and currently co-hosts the RTHK talk show This Week. She is the first Chinese-language news reporter of non-ethnic Chinese descent in Hong Kong. She attracted media attention in 2019 following her outspoken questioning of government officials. Biography Qoser was born in Hong Kong to Pakistani immigrant parents. She attributed her fluency in Cantonese to her education in mainstream schools and watching Cantonese-language television programmes daily. She achieved a grade of A in Chinese Language in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE), and graduated from the Hong Kong Baptist University's Department of Broadcast Journalism in 2008. Qoser is a member of the Society for Cultural Integration, an organisation which advocates for multiculturalism in Hong Kong. Career Following graduation, Qoser joined Now TV as a news reporter. She became Hong Kong's first Chinese-language news reporter of non-ethnic Chinese descent. Qoser later joined TVB News as a reporter, sometimes presenting News at 6:30. She left TVB in 2015 and joined Ming Pao as a journalist. =RTHK= Qoser joined RTHK as Assistant Programme Officer on 3 October 2017. As of September 2020, she hosts the current affairs talk show ' on RTHK TV 31. Qoser attracted media attention following her questioning of government officials over the 2019 Yuen Long attack. Chief Executive Carrie Lam and several government officials organised a press conference on 22 July 2020, more than ten hours after the mob attack, to respond to media enquiries. During the press conference, Qoser confronted Lam and Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo over the government's delayed response to the attack. She compared the late government press conference to the one held at 4 am soon after the storming of the Legislative Council Complex on 1 July. She further pressed the government on whether the attack was an act of cooperation between the government, the police, and triad groups. When Lam refused to respond directly, Qoser told her to \\"answer like a human being\\" (); Qoser also questioned government officials whether they were able to sleep well at night following the attack. Her sharp questioning of government officials was praised in the media and on Internet forums, with netizens calling her a \\"reporter with conscience\\" (). During the police press conference on 6 August 2019, Qoser asked police officers why they did not immediately arrest the mob attackers on 21 July, unlike their swift arrests on more recent days. She followed up with questions regarding the police's lack of warning to the public, and on CCTV footage that showed police presence that night; she persisted when the police spokesman answered her question indirectly. She was rumoured to have been banned from participating in police press conferences due to her being too direct in her questions, though the RTHK Programme Staff Union clarified that she did not receive pressure from RTHK or the police force. During a police press conference regarding the death of Chow Tsz-lok in November 2019, she repeatedly asked the police on their potential involvement of Chow's death. Other journalists participating in the conference asked Qoser to continue her question when police attempted to proceed to the next question. In January 2020, Qoser interviewed pro-Beijing politician Junius Ho on an episode of This Week. The episode, which Qoser hosted, originally involved a debate between Ho and actor Anthony Wong, though Wong quit last- minute due to an accident and the death of his father-in-law; in response, Qoser interviewed Ho directly. The combative interview involved discussion over the Yuen Long attack. Ho insisted that the attack was triggered by Lam Cheuk-ting bringing people to Yuen Long to provoke locals. Qoser rebuked Ho by pointing out that the first attack in Yuen Long that night occurred at 9:50 pm, before Lam's first appearance inside Yuen Long station at 10:50 pm. Following the interview, some followers of pro-Ho group \\"Silent Majority\\" directed racially charged comments at Qoser. In September 2020, RTHK informed Qoser that they would \\"reopen\\" their investigation into complaints regarding Qoser received between July and November 2019, including her performance during government press conferences, and asked to extend her probation period for another 120 days. Previously, her probation period would have lasted three years and would have ended in October 2020. Her colleagues, who entered the same time as she did, were able to complete the probation period successfully. The RTHK Program Staff Union strongly opposed the extension to Qoser's probation period, considering it to be \\"very unfair\\" and \\"unjustified suppression\\". Union leader Gladys Chiu said Qoser had completed six reviews within her probation period, where any issues with her professional work would have been raised already. According to information obtained by Ming Pao, the decision was made following pressure from executive organs external to RTHK. =Online harassment= Qoser had been subject to attacks by the pro-Beijing camp since the start of the 2019 protests, with users leaving comments on pro- Beijing social media pages targeting her skin colour and ethnicity. On 21 January 2020, the Equal Opportunities Commission issued a statement, which expressed \\"grave concern\\" over the social media comments and reiterated the commission's stance against verbal abuse. The statement, which did not directly mention Qoser by name, made reference to the , which prohibits discrimination and harassment based on a person's race.

In 1963 while the 37 year old Anthony exhibited some of his books at a Guild exposition, he met a visitor from the US, John F. Cuneo, owner of Chicago‚Äôs Cuneo Press, and avid fan of fine books. Career in the United States The Cuneo Press was a major publishing company in Chicago specializing in the printing of various magazines. In addition, John F. Cuneo‚Äôs love for books led him to create a small fine bookbinding department that was used to help promote the printing department operation. At the time that Cuneo met William Anthony in England, the master binder in charge of the fine bookbinding department, George A. Baer was seriously ill with hepatitis, and it was not clear if, or when Baer would return to work. Cuneo was so impressed with Anthony‚Äôs leather bindings, that he offered him the job in Cuneo Press‚Äôs fine binding department. Anthony, attracted by this ‚Äúhead of department‚Äù position, accepted the job and moved with his wife, Bernadette and their three children to Chicago. However, by the time the Anthony‚Äôs arrived in Chicago, George Baer had recovered and resumed his duties as ‚Äúhead of the department‚Äù, and William Anthony was given the position of ‚Äúhead of the Art Department‚Äù which permitted him to work occasionally on binding books until George Baer‚Äôs retirement in 1970. By 1973 it became clear that the Cuneo Press could no longer support the luxury of its fine binding department so Anthony began his transition to private practice, first via a partnership with an established Chicago bookbinder, Elisabeth Kner, followed in 1980 by his own company, Anthony and Associates. During this time, William Anthony was busy promoting the art and craft of bookbinding in the Chicago area and became a founding member of the Chicago Hand Bookbinders which remained a vital force until 2009, well past Anthony‚Äôs time. In 1984, William Anthony was appointed University Conservator at the University of Iowa library, a position he held until his death in 1989. During his five years at Iowa he was active in establishing the conservation department as well as setting up a world class bookbinding studio. Among the many students who studied with Anthony are: William Minter, Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler, Pamela Spitzmueller, David Brock, Mark Esser, Lawrence Yerkes William Anthony as an artist As is the case with most fine bookbinders, work that produces an income is not necessarily of the most artistic type. However, William Anthony seamlessly managed to combine his business activities, much of which was in book or document restoration with fine bindings through which he expressed his artistic visions. William Anthony was one of the last bookbinders who was thoroughly trained from a young age in the art of bookbinding through year- long apprenticeships and journeymen status.

The super wood is stronger than steel but six times lighter, opening up endless applications. History Super wood was invented in 2018 through a new densification process. The new densification technique involves two steps: step 1, chemical treatment to partially remove lignin and hemicellulose; and step 2, mechanical hot-pressing at 100 ¬∞C, which leads to a reduction in thickness of about 80%. The process enables complete collapse of the voids and pits, in natural wood, thus substantially reduces the defects in the wood, leading to a significantly higher strength of the processed wood. The material and technology are patented. The super wood demonstrates a record high tensile strength of ~ 600 MPa, which is higher than all reported densified wood materials before 2018. The high strength of the super wood results from the enhanced interaction (e.g., hydrogen bonding], Van der Waals forces and physical entangles) among the alignment of cellulose nanofibrils and effective reduction of intrinsic defects in natural wood. The intrinsic light weight of the super wood (with a density of ~1.3 g/cm2) delivers a specific strength higher than almost all structural metals and alloys. This strategy is shown to be universally effective for various species of woods. The super wood with high strength and toughness along with its low cost, abundant resource, light weight, and zero greenhouse gas emission can be potentially used as a sustainable structural material in lightweight vehicles, energy-efficient buildings, advanced furniture, etc.  References  Category:Engineered wood Category:Building materials ","title":"Super Wood"},{"id":"65442028","text":"The Jacques Lemans Arena is a football stadium in Sankt Veit an der Glan, in the southern Austrian state of Carinthia.

The Storm extended their lead via a big second quarter, which they won by fifteen points. Seattle took an eighteen point lead into halftime. The Aces came out of halftime strong, winning the third quarter by fifteen points and cut the overall lead to three. However, the Storm won the fourth quarter by eleven points to take the game by thirteen overall. They take a one game lead in the best-of-five series. The Storm were lead by Breanna Stewart who recorded thirty seven points and fifteen rebounds. Jewell Loyd also contributed 28 points. Sue Bird set a WNBA Finals single game record for assists in a game with sixteen. The Storm's bench contributed fifteen total points. The Aces were lead by Angel McCoughtry with twenty points. A'ja Wilson added nineteen and three other players scored in double digits. The Aces' bench scored sixteen points. =Game 2= Game two started with the Storm winning the first quarter by seven points. The Aces made a small comeback and won the second quarter by one point. Therefore, the Storm took a lead of six points into half time. The Storm won the third quarter by a point and the fourth quarter by six points to win the game by thirteen points overall. The Storm won the first two games by the same thirteen point margin to take a 2‚Äì0 lead in the series. Five Storm players scored in double digits, including three who scored at least twenty points. Breanna Stewart was the leading scorer with twenty-two points, and she was closely followed by Alysha Clark and Natasha Howard, who both scored twenty-one.

However, the Storm dominated the rest of the way, outscoring the Aces 69-38 through the remaining 30 minutes. The 33 point margin of victory was by far the most lopsided of the series after Seattle had won the first two games by 13 points each. WNBA Finals MVP Breanna Stewart fittingly lead the Storm in points once again with 26. Jewell Loyd added 19 points and a team-high 9 rebounds while Jordin Canada managed 15 points off the bench.

Background The Sri Lankan Civil War began in 1983 following years of racial and political tensions between the Majority Sinhalese and the Minority Tamil people in Sri Lanka. The Indian Peacekeeping Force arrived in 1987 following the Indo-Lanka accord. The JVP opposed the arrival of the IPKF and revolted against the pro-Western J. R. Jayawardene led government. They named the UNP government as traitors and created the \\"Patriotic People's Movement\\" (DJV) which carried out the attack. Piyasiri later would operate as the leader of the JVP. Attack On 15 April 1987, DJV attacked the Pallekele Army Camp in Kandy. Led by a former soldier, Mahinda, under the directions of Shantha Bandara, the JVP seized 12 Type 56 assault rifles, seven sub-machine guns and ammunition. The attack is reported as \\"did not cause any deaths\\" but it's highly alleged that the JVP killed a certain amount of Military personnel. The armed wing was operated by Saman Piyasiri Fernando and Adhikari aka Kosala. Prelude As claimed by Kosala, The JVP used to train with machetes and swords but sometimes they would get guns which a mostly T-56 rifles and repeaters. JVP trained members in a rural village and gave them military costumes to enter the Pallekele base. Then they would take the weapons out and start shooting the guards. =Collecting minor weapons= He claims that the JVP forced local gun owners to hand over their weapons and \\"make a patriotic donation\\" and if not they will die. The name Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna was never revealed during war but instead used the name Patriotic People Movement. They also attacked the Digana bank where they stole a shotgun that was held by the security guard. Investigation and Aftermath Months later 7 June 1987, Sri Lanka Air Force Base, SLAF Katunayake and the Kotelawala Defence Academy were attacked and weapons and ammunition were stolen while only four of the attackers were killed in the entire series of attacks. DJV claimed responsibility and the Criminal Investigation Department investigation resulted in 13 JVP members arrested. Kosala stated that these weren't against the Sri Lankan army but attempts made to collect weapons and arm themselves for the conflict. He further stated that they also collected weapons using Premakumar Gunaratnam's Tamil faction who attacked the IPKF military base base in Kallar. =Weaponry Usage= Kosala claims that JVP used to abduct members of the elite social class by force, killed political opposition members or rivals of the party. This attack helped the JVP to be well armed for certain assassinations made the same year. The Army was deployed on the North to fight against the LTTE, this made the Sri Lankan army a vulnerable target of the JVP. The JVP claimed to use the weapons to further attack the deployed India Army. Over 200 trained military personnel was killed and over 400 police officers were killed as many conservative reports say while the death toll is placed at 66,000.Sri Lanka in 1987: Indian Intervention and Resurgence of the JVP.

She came to notice in London in 1712 and was last recorded in Potsdam in 1736. Life Her place and date of birth are unknown and although her sister is known to be the very successful singer Margherita de l'Epine, their parents are also unknown. Her sister, Margherita, began her career in 1703 and it is thought that Maria was working in the same company at the Queen's Theatre, Haymarket for some time before she was named. In 1712 she was first named when she sang in John Hughes' Calypso and Telemachus on 17 May 1712. She had been reputably paid ¬£100 to sing the role by Heidegger. She appeared as Eucharis singing, Gay, Young, and Fair. In 1713 confusion arose after she appeared as Clitia in Handel's Teseo, being named as 'La Sorella della Sig. Margarita'. Charles Burney confused her with Maria Gallia and he recorded that Gallia sang the role and that Gallin was L'Epine's sister. This mistake has been repeated elsewhere. Manina continued to get smaller roles at the Queen's Theatre until 1715 when she appeared elsewhere. She sang at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre on 6 October 1715 and on 2 January 1717 she was given the title role of Giovanni Bononcini's Camilla which was presented in English. She was working until 1721 when a benefit concert took place. Nothing is heard of her until 1826 when her role as Camilla is revived and it went for 20 more performances at the Lincoln's Inn Fields. She appeared in male parts in Johann Christoph Pepusch‚Äôs \\"Venus and Adonis\\" and \\"Myrtillo\\" in 1730 and in pantomime afterpieces there in 1831. The following year she sang Charles John Frederick Lampe‚Äôs \\"Britannia\\" at the New Haymarket. She was at that theatre until 1832 although she had changed her name to Sydow or Seedo due to her marriage in 1827 to Seedo. In May 1836 she is last mentioned where she was in Potsdam in Prussia. Her husband had been appointed as the musical director for Friedrich Wilhelm I. When her husband had been put forward for the job it had been recorded that his wife could sing well.

It is also a contributor to the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Equitable Building was envisioned as part of The Five-Finger Plan, an infrastructure plan that made use of both public and private funds to \\"metropolitanize\\" Hollywood as an urban core. It was designed by architect Alex Curlett and built in two phases. The first phase was undertaken in 1929, which created of office space above the ground floor, which housed retail businesses and the Bank of Hollywood. The second phase of construction took place in 1931, at which point Myron Selznick, brother of David O. Selznick, moved his agency into the building. Kenneth P.

In April 1931, the Jassby Drug Company entered a long-term lease for space on the building's ground floor. The first floor at one time housed Bernard Luggage, Oshkosh Luggage, and other businesses. From the 1950s through the 1970s, storefronts and interior public spaces were modernized, including a front entrance redesign, while between 1999 and 2001, exterior and main lobby alterations were remediated and original features were reconstructed. As of 2004, the building's upper stories have been converted to residential use, with 60 units' worth of condos designed by Kenneth Brown and Pamela Shamshiri. Circa 2011, the architectural M2A held office space in the lower retail space.

It was found by Pan- STARRS on 20 November 2014 and was announced later in July 2016 after additional observations and precovery identifications. It is in the Kuiper belt, a region of icy objects orbiting beyond Neptune in the outer Solar System. It is classified as a plutino, a dynamical class of objects in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. On 1 December 2018, a team of astronomers observed a stellar occultation by the object, which revealed that it is a compact binary system consisting of two separate components in close orbit around each other. The primary and secondary components are estimated to have diameters of around and , respectively.  Observations  = Discovery = Before the announcement of its discovery, had been observed by the Pan-STARRS survey from 2011 to 2015. All of these observations were made with the Pan- STARRS1 1.8-meter Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien telescope, located at the HaleakalƒÅ Observatory atop the Hawaiian island of Maui. The accredited observers using the telescope were B. Gibson, T. Goggia, N. Primak, A. Schultz, and M. Willman. The object was first identified on 20 November 2014, though it was announced later in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular published on 17 July 2016, after additional observations by Pan-STARRS had been found, preceding the team's original observation from 2014. While is the object's first and only provisional designation assigned by the Minor Planet Center, the date of discovery is considered to be on 8 September 2011, which was the earliest known observation of the object before it was assigned a minor planet number. = Occultation = On 1 December 2018, occulted a 15th-magnitude double star, blocking out its starlight for a maximal duration of approximately 11 seconds. The stellar occultation was observed by astronomers and citizen scientists across the West Coast of the United States and Canada. Of the 41 participating sites, six of them reported dimmings in the star's brightness, signifying likely positive detections of the occultation. Five of these sites reported two consecutive dimmings due to the occulted star's double nature; occulted one of the two stars being observed. These observations were part of a campaign coordinated by the Research and Education Collaborative Occultation Network (RECON), a citizen science project dedicated to observing occultations by trans-Neptunian objects. Prior to the occultation, had only been observed by Pan-STARRS over an observation arc of 3 years. The calculated orbit from these Pan-STARRS observations had significant uncertainty, which would have been unreliable for predicting occultations. In an effort to reduce the orbital uncertainty, the RECON project collaborated with the Pan-STARRS project to do a precovery search of archival Pan-STARRS images to gather extensive astrometric positions of . Follow-up observations by Pan-STARRS were also conducted through 2016‚Äì2018 and helped extend 's observation arc to 6.3 years. Although an observation arc of this length is generally unreliable for predicting occultations especially by distant objects, this was compensated by Pan-STARRS's highly accurate astrometric system, allowing for 's orbital uncertainty to be significantly reduced.  Binary system  Observations of the December 2018 occultation revealed that is a compact binary system consisting of two separate components in close orbit around each other. Of the six sites that reported positive detections of the occultation, one site located in Bishop, California, detected a shorter dimming event separate from the main detections by the other five sites located south of it. A 2020 study led by Rodrigo Leiva and Marc Buie analyzed the occultation data and determined that the detection from Bishop was most likely an occultation by a secondary component of . Since the two components were only observed for a short period of time during the occultation, the binary system's orbital parameters have not been determined. The projected separation distance between the primary and secondary is , derived from an angular separation of milliarcseconds. Assuming a density of for both components, their mutual orbital period would likely be under one day. has the smallest observed component separation of all known binary TNOs , followed by (~420 km) and 47171 Lempo (~870 km). Such close binary TNOs would be difficult to resolve in direct imaging due to their characteristic small separation distances between their components. Most models of the formation of the Solar System indicate that most TNOs have formed as binaries, hence they are expected to be common especially in the Kuiper belt population. While most known binary TNOs appear to have wide mutual orbits, close binary TNOs similar to are thought to have a higher chance of survival after their formation. belongs to the population of smaller TNOs, which are expected to have a primordial origin similar to the classical Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth.  Physical characteristics  Assuming a circular projected shape for the components' occultation profiles, the diameters of the primary and secondary are estimated to be and , respectively. The diameter ratio of the secondary to the primary is 0.76:1.00‚Äîthe secondary component is approximately 75% as large as the primary. Since the mutual orbit of the components is undetermined, the mass and density of the system cannot be derived. The individual components of the system are among the smallest trans-Neptunian objects with sizes measured with stellar occultations, following the sednoid 541132 LeleƒÅk≈´honua (~) and the Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (~). Given the components' estimated diameters and their combined absolute magnitude of 7.2, their calculated geometric albedos indicate that they have dark surfaces, reflecting about 5% of incident visible light. However, the estimated geometric albedo may be subject to a systematic error depending on the true shapes and photometric properties of the components, resulting in a significant uncertainty of ¬±2%. Nonetheless, is one of the darkest objects measured with stellar occultations, being darker than 486958 Arrokoth.  Orbit and classification  is classified as a plutino, a subgroup of the resonant trans-Neptunian objects located in the inner region of Kuiper belt. Named after the group's largest member, Pluto, the plutinos are in a 2:3 mean-motion orbital resonance with Neptune. That is, they complete two orbits around the Sun for every three orbits that Neptune takes. orbits the Sun at an average distance of , taking 245.8 years to complete a full orbit. This is characteristic of all plutinos, which have orbital periods around 250 years and semi-major axes around 39 AU. Like Pluto, 's orbit is elongated and inclined to the ecliptic. has an orbital eccentricity of 0.25 and an orbital inclination of 19.5 degrees with respect to the ecliptic. Over the course of its orbit, 's distance from the Sun varies from 29.5 AU at perihelion (closest distance) to 48.9 AU at aphelion (farthest distance). has last passed aphelion in the early 20th century, and is now moving closer to the Sun, approaching perihelion by 2032. Simulations by the Deep Ecliptic Survey show that can acquire a perihelion distance (qmin) as small as 28.7 AU over the next 10 million years.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 25 September 2018 and received the number in the minor planet catalog. As of 2020, it has not been named.

The gas station was built by Frank Fiene in 1912 at the corner of 7th Avenue and 19th Street. It was moved to its present 4th Avenue location in 1921 to take advantage of the traffic off of the Lincoln Highway when it was rerouted through Belle Plaine. George W. Preston bought the station two years later for $100. The gas station is a single-story wood-frame structure. It had a canopy that extended over the gas pumps, but it was removed before 1965. A single- story concrete block garage was built next to the station in 1943. It features a sliding barn door on its main facade. Automobile repairs were performed in the garage before it housed Preston's memorabilia collection, which is now located in the former gas station as well.

Often described as a blend of R&B; and dance, their music spans a wide variety of genres including pop, hip hop, jazz, bossa nova, and electronic. Though currently signed to independent label Ghostly International, the band is known for their DIY approach to creating and releasing their music. Their debut album Dance Without Me was released in February 2020. History =Origins and Formation= Before meeting in 2013, Shehade and Rosa had individual careers in the music industry. Born in Austin, Texas and raised on an Indian reservation in northern California, Rosa grew up touring with her parents who played in a reggae band. Rosa developed an interest in poetry while attending charter school, which she began combining with beats she wrote in her late teenage years. After attending a culinary school in Hollywood, Rosa moved to Chicago in 2010 to be with her grandmother who was battling cancer. There, she joined hip hop collective THEMPeople and released her own musical projects between 2010 and 2014. Shehade, who was born and raised in Chicago, spent his teenage years DJing at clothing shops and record stores, and enjoying the city's house and electronic music scenes. He began making his own music in high school (which led to Bravo licensing his music), and although he eventually attended business school to study arts management, he ultimately began collaborating with other artists as a producer. Before forming Drama, Shehade worked on projects with Chance The Rapper (Acid Rap), Kanye West (G.O.O.D. Music's Cruel Summer compilation), Chief Keef, and Vic Mensa among others. Shehade was encouraged to start releasing his own music by artist Nicolas Jaar. Shehade and Rosa were introduced in 2013 by vocalist Jean Deaux, who at the time was collaborating with Shehade and friends with Rosa. Originally the project was informal, but eventually solidified into a fully formed duo with Shehade producing and Rosa singing and writing. =2015‚Äì2016: Gallows EP= In September 2015, Drama released their debut single \\"Hopes Up\\". The song was one of the first they wrote, later accompanied by a video in January 2016 directed by fellow Chicago native Christopher Kostrzak. Following the release of an additional single \\"Forever's Gone\\" in May, the duo released their debut Gallows EP in November 2016. Named for gallows humor, the release reflects on painful experiences with levity. The band would later release a collection of remixes from the EP in January 2018. =2018: Lies After Love EP= After releasing its first single \\"Majid\\" in April, the duo independently released their sophomore EP Lies After Love in May 2018. The EP's title summarizes the lyrical content of its songs, which are about \\"affirmations and lies one tells themselves to get over a heartbreak\\" as Rosa explained. The band supported the release with a series of U.S. tour dates on the US West Coast and a performance at Mamby on the Beach festival in June, followed by the Middle East and Europe in the fall. Over the course of the next year, the duo released singles \\"Ready for Love\\" in October 2018, \\"Dead and Gone\\" in January 2019, and \\"Give No Fucks\\" in June 2019. The band also toured with French artist Jain in fall 2018, and completed their own 15-date North American headline tour in February 2019 including a sold-out show at the Echo in Los Angeles. =2019‚ÄìPresent: Ghostly International and Dance Without Me= In 2019 Drama signed with independent label Ghostly International, releasing their first single \\"Hold On\\" with the label in September followed by a tour with SG Lewis that fall. In November, Drama announced their debut album Dance Without Me as well as their 2020 North American, UK, and European headline tour dates alongside their single release \\"Gimme Gimme.\\" The band released two additional singles before the album: \\"Nine One One\\" in December, and \\"Years\\" in January 2020 with a video directed by Adam Chitayat. The latter track track was named \\"Today's Top Tune\\" by LA radio station KCRW in February. Drama released Dance Without Me on February 14, 2020 via Ghostly International. The album, hailed as a \\"powerful ode to heartbreak and the metamorphosis that comes from the spiritual journey to total self-love and acceptance\\" continues exploring the themes of love and loss that have pervaded the bands career. The band promoted the album with a series of headline U.S. tour dates, including sold-out shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Brooklyn, and more, though some dates were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, Drama teamed up with UK electronic duo Gorgon City to release \\"Nobody\\", a single which came to fruition in the studio while Kye Gibbon was spending time in Chicago. The single was accompanied by a video shot in Chicago featuring a street dance interpretation of West Side Story as a tribute to their collaboration. In September, Drama revisited Dance Without Me by releasing a remix EP also released by Ghostly International, featuring Poolside (band), Pional, Rezident, and Moglii. Musical Style Drama's music has been described as \\"happy sad\\", characterized by Rosa's poignant lyrics about love and heartbreak designed for healing and catharsis, balanced out by Shehade's production featuring \\"throbbing synths and R&B.;\\" Rosa has cited Sade, Drake, Stevie Nicks, and Kurt Cobain among her lyrical influences, and Billie Holiday and Toni Braxton as vocal influences. Shehade, who was influenced by Chicago house scene growing up, counts Jon Brion and Pharrell among his production influences. As they describe it, the duo's writing process involves Shehade accenting emotions evoked by Rosa's lyrics, which consist of revisiting past experiences to find new perspective.

It is a field of white and yellow separated by a two blue curved lines with a white line between them and a red six-pointed star in the upper left corner. History = 1965 flag = On May 23, 1965, the 100th anniversary of the city charter, South Bend first raised their flag, which featured a blue version of the city seal on a field of yellow. The seal reads \\"THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA\\" and the year of the city's founding, 1865. The seal also shows the word \\"PEACE,\\" a 35-star American flag (which was in use at the time of the city's founding), and a sunrise. The city seal itself dates back to at least 1949. = 2016 flag = In October 2015, in celebration of the city's 150 anniversary, a competition was announced for residents to submit their own designs for a new flag. Color use was limited to blue, red, yellow, and white; and designs had to include symbols for the St. Joseph River, connectivity, diversity, and innovation. Submissions were also asked to adhere to the North American Vexillological Association's five basic principles of flag design. Over 200 submissions were received from residents of all ages and narrowed down to three from residents and professional graphic designers Garrett Gingerich, Jeffrey Koenig, and Indiana University South Bend student Jesse Villagrana. Community input was collected with over 1,000 online and in-person comments from residents. Gingerich was ultimately commissioned to make the final design, wherein he had to integrate elements from all three of the finalist designs as well as public feedback. The final design was unveiled on March 9, 2016 at an event with Koenig and Villagrana; the flag was officially adopted several weeks later on April 25. Symbolism The red six-pointed star represents the city's six council districts. The color red symbolizes passion and was chosen due to its common use in local logos and for its national patriotism It also evokes the stars of the flag of the nearby city of Chicago, although that flag uses a lighter shade of red. The blue lines represent the St. Joseph River, which runs through South Bend. According to designer Garret Gingerich, the S-shape of the blue lines is meant to invoke the city's name while the strip of white in between serves as a bridge to the future. The white on the left symbolizes peace; the yellow on the right symbolizes friendship and was the field color of South Bend's original flag.

Life Frances MacCurtain was born Frances Foad in Belfast on 12 October 1936. Her parents were Roland, a chartered accountant and Betty Foad. She had one brother. Her father was employed as a financial director over a number of government bodies relating to the steel industry. In the 1960s, he was involved in the fixing of steel prices. The Foad family left Belfast when MacCurtain was young, moving to Surrey, where she grew up. In 1959, she qualified as a speech therapist, with her first appointment being in Manchester. She would go on to focus on clinical research relating to phonetics and voice quality. In 1961, she married the poet Tony Connor, with whom she had three children, 2 sons and a daughter, Rebecca. MacCurtain continued her clinical work, and did some lecturing in Manchester Polytechnic. She divorced Connor in 1979, and remarried to Austin MacCurtain. She later divorced MacCurtain. In 1979, MacCurtain was awarded an M.Sc. in phonetics from University College, London, and in the same year was appointed had of a research team at Middlesex Hospital investigating laryngectomy measurement. The work of this team resulted in numerous publications on the anatomical and pharyngeal effects of singing and laughter. She completed a PhD concurrently with this work, and in 1982 she became the first person to receive a PhD in speech science in Britain with the thesis entitled Pharyngeal factors influencing voice quality. She went on to make appearances on the BBC television show, Tomorrow's World, and lectured at the Royal College of Surgeons, London and in the United States. Her work imaging and measuring voice function using techniques such as xeroradiography was noticed by the commercial sector, and in collaboration with IBM, MacCurtain developed the IBM Speech Viewer computer which was used in speech clinics. She left research in 1988, and founded VoicePower (later renamed Zarbo), training business executives techniques to control their voices during high pressure presentations.

The settlement was founded during the 13th century by the Mortimer family in order to strengthen their hold on land in the vicinity of the Cefnllys Castle, with which the town was closely associated. The town was probably intended to become the primary settlement of the lordship and cantref of Maelienydd, but was unsuccessful and declined during the 14th century as a result of bubonic plague outbreaks, economic isolation and military insecurity. Despite this, Cefnllys retained its borough status until the 19th century. History View of the church and surrounding earthworks The date of the town's founding is unrecorded. It may have been established concurrently with the first stone castle at Cefnllys in the 1240s, but a later date is more likely, particularly after the creation of royally-sponsored English towns at Flint, Aberystwyth, and Rhuddlan in the aftermath of Edward I's conquest of Wales. The settlement was extant in 1297, when it was documented as being granted a market charter. It had gained borough status by 1304, when it was recorded as having a population of 25 residents, as well as a church and a town mill on the River Ithon. Records of pontage indicate the existence of a toll bridge, probably at the site of the current-day footbridge. A deer park, probably located north of the castle, was also recorded in 1360. The presence of a manor at Cefnllys was highly unusual given the upland terrain, and reflect the efforts of the Mortimer lords to establish manorialism in Maelienydd in order to consolidate their rule in Maelienydd and increase the region's revenue. The rule of English barons was resented by the region's Welsh population, and in 1297 a group of aggrieved locals travelled to London to present their complaints to King Edward I, who granted them an audience in front of the English Parliament. Subsequent letters from the king to Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer forced Edmund to restore the traditional Welsh court at Cymaron, undermining attempts to strengthen the castle's manorial court. The authority of the Mortimer lords within Maelienydd was limited to the district surrounding the town and castle. In the place of rent, small amounts of tribute were taken from the Welsh community, as evidenced by accounts from 1356-7 which show that out of the cantref's gross income of ¬£215, only ¬£15 was extracted from the Welshry outside the shire of Dinieithon. The town was ultimately short-lived: by 1332 the population had decreased to 20 citizens and it had further shrunk by 1383, when it is recorded as having only 10 burgesses. Its failure was probably due to a combination of factors, including recurrent outbreaks of plague across Britain in 1349, 1361‚Äì62 and 1369. The town's isolated position in the hilly, sparsely populated region of Mid Wales weakened its economic appeal, and Robert Rees Davies comments that the militarily advantageous location of the borough undermined its feasibility as a settlement: \\"the artificiality of [its] commercial setting was too obvious once the military opportunities... had been removed\\". The constant threat of war within the Welsh Marches would have also contributed its decline. Cefnllys remained a borough after the decline of the medieval settlement, although the borough eventually encompassed one-fifth of the parish. From the Laws in Wales Act 1542 until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, it was a classed as a contributory borough, jointly electing an MP to the Radnor Boroughs constituency in the English and British parliament with four other Radnorshire boroughs. In 1742, the landscape painter Thomas Jones was born at Cefnllys. In 1831, the population of the borough was 16 residents, in \\"three Farm Houses and one small Cottage\\". Location The lack of visible remains has meant the town's location has not been conclusively proven. The population may have been small enough to fit within the enclosure of Castle Bank, a large ridge on which the Mortimer family built two 13th century castles. Supporters of this interpretation emphasise the settlement's military role as a garrison town, and suggest that the stone wall surrounding the ridge enclosure would have formed part of the town defences. The more frequent explanation is that the settlement was concentrated around St Michael's Church, on low land next to the river, where there would have been easy access to the mill and a nearby spring. A series of earthworks surrounding the church represent raised causeways above boggy land, sunken roads in the direction of the toll bridge and probable medieval house platforms, as well as ridge and furrow patterns from open-field system agriculture. Archaeological finds surrounding the church have been mostly from the Tudor period or later, however. The church's structure is of 13th century origin, although the date of its founding is unknown and it was heavily restored in 1895.

Centered in the coastal town of Ipswich, Massachusetts north of Boston, a community of lacemaking arose in the 18th century. Earliest known records indicate that lace produced by local women was used to barter for goods in the 1760s, as denoted by ledger account books belonging to local merchants. These laces were sold in the region from Boston to Maine. It is surmised that Ipswich Lace represents an offshoot of the style of lace known today as Bucks point lace, but developed characteristics and patterns of its own over the production period. Ipswich bobbin lace is similar to European bobbin laces of the 18th century such as Mechlin and Valenciennes. They were made as borders and insertions to be added to clothing or household items. It is a continuous lace, meaning that the threads continue from the beginning to the end of the pattern, as opposed to non-continuous laces, where the threads that are used for the motifs (dense, decorative parts) are not the same threads as those used to make the fillings and grounds (the open parts connecting the motifs). The motifs in Ipswich lace are mostly surrounded with a thick gimp (outline) thread. Most of the motifs are constructed with the half stitch (Cross-Twist), and the ground of small meshes connecting the motifs consists of either some variation on the Torchon ground or the Kat-stitch, also called Paris ground. A decorative edge of two-threaded picots (loops) are very common. The Point ground (cross, twist, twist, twist) as used in Bucks point and other similar laces were not used as a ground in the Ipswich laces, only as a decorative filling.  History  Typically the lace was produced from \\"prickings\\" or patterns created on parchment or pasteboard that were attached to a round bolster-style lace pillow. Bobbins whittled from local wood or reeds were used to provide the thread repository and the appropriate tension for constructing the lace. Linen or silk thread was the material commonly used in the early period with cotton employed only later after the development of mercerised cotton improved thread characteristics. Imported and individually handmade pins provided the structural support for the patterns, until pin-making machines became available in the 1840s. Known lace examples are largely white linen or black silk threads. Dana Report of Ipswich Lace Production By the 1790s, over 600 women in the Ipswich area were producing significant quantities of lace for sale. Stored in the Library of Congress with the papers of Alexander Hamilton, a report of this activity was submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury with actual samples of Ipswich lace. Reverend Joseph Dana, author of the report, provided: Rev. Dana reported 13483 yards of edgings and 28496 yards of lace, for a total of 41979 yards of Ipswich lace made by local women in that time frame. Section of a shopkeeper's advertisement from Newburyport MA in 1797, highlighting Ipswich lace. Courtesy of the Newburyport Public Library Lace making continued through the end of the century and into the early 1800s as a hand-made activity, and period advertisements for ‚ÄúAmerican Laces‚Äù and ‚ÄúIpswich Lace‚Äù indicate that the lace was available from local merchants, on par with competing European laces. Extant samples of Ipswich lace on garments can be found in various archives. For example, a silk hood and a cloak featuring Ipswich lace are found in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Martha Washington possessed a shawl made with Ipswich lace which is preserved in the Mount Vernon collection. Lace adorning a man's Masonic \\"Memento mori\\" apron is also an Ipswich lace. The Ipswich Historical Society and Ipswich MuseumIpswich Museum have conserved artifacts of the lace-making activities. In the 1820s, attempts to mechanize lace production in Ipswich shifted activity away from hand made pillow laces to embroidery on lace bobbinet that was produced by machine. Although some lace makers continued to produce pillow lace, and samples of Ipswich lace were cherished and stored by traditional lace makers like Sarah Lakeman, hand-made lace making was no longer a widespread commercial practice. By the 21st century, revived interest in this historical lace was supported by new scholarship. In addition, archived lace samples that are stored in the Library of Congress have been re-created by Karen Thompson, and pattern working diagrams have been published that enable lace makers to accurately reproduce this lace today.

The Periodical aims to discuss liberal arts, the studies of natural sciences, philosophy and theology. However, it places special emphasis on the discussions and studies based on inter-disciplinary dialogue. The Periodical draws inspiration from Franciscan Intellectual Heritage, and thus it offers a unique identity from which its very own nature brings forth a multidisciplinary interest and an integrative viewpoint.

The district contains many neighborhoods in Chicago, including portions of the Loop, Near West Side, Near South Side, North Lawndale, Englewood, and Washington Park community areas. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Early life and career Deer was born and raised in the North Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago. He attended Collins High School in Chicago. After high school, he left the Chicago area to attend Jackson State University and obtained his Bachelor of Science in elementary/special education and Master of Science in rehabilitation psychology. He later obtained his Ph.D. in christian psychology from Agape Theological Institute. Deer became interested in studying behavioral health after witnessing a murder at the age of 10 and suffering from PTSD. He has also earned certifications as a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor, forensic counselor, rehabilitation counselor, corrective thinking therapist, and Illinois law enforcement standards and training instructor. Deer returned to Chicago after university and founded Deer Rehabilitation Services, a therapy services provider in North Lawndale with a specialty in rehabilitating ex-offenders. He also founded and served on the executive committee of the North Lawndale Community Coordinating Council, a group of community stakeholders working to guide comprehensive planning and implementation in North Lawndale. In his capacity as president of Deer Rehabilitation Services, Deer graduated from the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses program and the Chicago Urban League nextONE business acceleration program. In 2018, Deer became the Vice President of Organizational Health and Management for the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, a nonprofit provider of holistic legal services to people 24 years or younger that utilizes restorative justice. As of 2020, Deer was also a landlord. Political career =Early political involvement= In 2003, Deer ran for 24th ward Alderman in Chicago against two-term incumbent, Michael Chandler. After failing to challenge the nomination papers of Chandler, Deer went on to come in third place behind Alderman Chandler and Joe Ann Bradley, a co-founder of Citizen's Action Group which worked towards eliminating prostitution in North Lawndale. In 2007, Deer filed to run for 24th ward Democratic Committeeman in the 2008 primary, but withdrew as a candidate after facing a challenge to his nominating papers. Deer served as the president of County Commissioner Robert Steele's fundraising committee until Steele's death in 2017 and considered Steele to be a mentor. He was also the chairman of an anti-violence task force that Steele's 2nd County District Community Advisory Council created with U.S. Representative Danny K. Davis. =2017 appointment= 2nd district Cook County Commissioner Robert Steele died on June 19, 2017, due to complications related to diabetes. On July 13th, 2017, a committee chaired by 24th ward Alderman and Democratic Committeeman, Michael Scott Jr., and made up of the Chicago Democratic ward committeepeople for all wards that made up the 2nd district was convened to select Steele's replacement to fill the rest of his term. Votes for the successor were weighted based on how many constituents of each ward committeeperson were also a constituent of the 2nd district. Deer and 12 other candidates applied, including 20th ward Democratic Committeeman Kevin Bailey (a member of the selection committee), Reyahd Kazmi (the husband of City Clerk Anna M. Valencia), and State Representative and future City Treasurer Melissa Conyears. Conyears was also the wife of a selection committee member, 28th ward Alderman and Democratic Committeeman Jason Ervin. After appearing as a candidate, Conyears ultimately left prior to interviewing. Deer received endorsements from the chairman of the replacement committee, Alderman Scott Jr., and from the Steele family. The Steele family endorsement carried weight as Robert Steele had held the seat since 2006 and before that his mother, Bobbie L. Steele, held the seat from 1986-2006. Deer won over the committee as a life-long community member who could build on the work of Robert Steele. As the former president of Steele's fundraising committee, he said \\"We already know how to raise money. We know how to win elections and we're ready to hit ground running.\\" After three rounds of voting, Deer won the fourth and final round unanimously. =2018 campaign= In 2018, Deer ran to be elected to his first full term as 2nd district Cook County Commissioner. Deer won the Democratic nomination in the March 20th Democratic primary, in which he faced four opponents. Deer stated that his priorities were \\"Fiscal Responsibility, Economic Development, Healthcare, and Public Safety.\\" His opponents included Eddie Johnson III, a Chicago Public Schools educator, Paul J. Montes II, attorney and entrepreneur, Lupe Aguirre, a Chicago police officer and attorney, and Darryl D. Smith, community volunteer. During the primary campaign, Deer was endorsed by U.S. Representative Danny Davis, Alderman Michael Scott Jr., Alderman David Moore, former Cook County Board President and 2nd district Commissioner Bobbie Steele, the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune. After winning the primary, Deer won the November 6th, 2018 general election unopposed. He was sworn in for his first full term on December 3, 2018. Cook County Commissioner =Tenure= 2017 sweetened beverage tax repeal Shortly after taking office, the Board of Commissioners was considering the repeal of the controversial penny-an-ounce tax on sugar- and artificially sweetened beverages that was supported by President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners Toni Preckwinkle. After initially supporting the tax at the time of his appointment, Deer ultimately voted for the successful repeal of the tax on October 11th, 2017. Racial justice On July 25, 2019, the Board of Commissioners passed Deer's resolution declaring a racism and racial inequalities a public health crisis in Cook County. The resolution was intended to encourage growth in public health support networks to work towards decreases in racial disparities in health outcomes. Supporters of the bill believed it was important since communities of color are disproportionately impacted by things such as exposure to lead, poor air quality, a lack of safe spaces, and inadequate health education. On July 7th, 2020, Deer along with fellow Commissioners Deborah Sims, Stanley Moore, Brandon Johnson, Bill Lowry and Donna Miller released a statement calling for passage of the Justice for Black Lives resolution. In referring to the changes demanded by recent Black Lives Matter protests the statement said, \\"As Black members of the Cook County Board we are determined to be the catalyst for that transformation in our county and beyond. The first step in that process is passage of the Justice for Black Lives Resolution, which would seek to redirect funds from our criminal justice system into systems and programs that support human needs and promote the health and welfare of the Black community.\\" The non-binding resolution passed in a 15-1 vote on July 30th, 2020. 2020 census Deer served as one of the Vice-Chairs of the Cook County Complete Count Census Commission for the 2020 United States Census. In this capacity, he worked to help ensure everyone in Cook County was properly counted to make sure Cook County receives proper legislative representation and government funding in areas such as social services and infrastructure. On August 18th, 2020, Deer co-hosted an event in Englewood giving out prizes to those who filled out the census with Alderman Stephanie Coleman and various local organizations. Housing Deer supported the Just Housing Amendment that was passed by the Board of Commissioners on April 25, 2019 and went into effect January 1, 2020. The amendment prohibited landlords from denying housing applications based on arrest records or convictions that are more than 3 years old and required an individualized assessment of convictions less than 3 years old for otherwise qualified applicants. Deer decided he wanted to champion this issue as someone who is both a landlord and works with ex-incarcerated men and women. He stated, \\"There's no room for double jeopardy. People should not be required to pay over and over and over again for a crime they committed when they were 19.\\" =Committee assignments= As a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Deer serves on multiple committees of both the Board of Commissioners and the Forest Preserve District Board.

The goal of \\"Smart Voting\\" is to consolidate the votes of those who oppose United Russia. History On November 28, 2018, Alexey Navalny announced the launch of the Smart Voting project. Initially, the system was mainly aimed at depriving the nominees from the United Russia party of their victory in the elections to the post of governor of St. Petersburg and the Moscow City Duma on September 8, 2019 . ‚ÄúThe parties themselves cannot agree and nominate a single candidate against United Russia. But we can agree on this. We are different, but we have one policy - we are against the monopoly of United Russia. Everything else is mathematics. If we all act smartly and vote for the strongest candidate, he will win, and United Russia will lose, ‚Äù said Navalny. On December 7, 2018, Roskomnadzor blocked the 2019.vote website for violating the rights of subjects of personal data. Vadim Ampelonsky, a spokesman for the supervisory service, said that the site lacked a proper privacy policy. On September 3, 2019, Aleksey Navalny named candidates for Smart Voting. The system was used in 31 regions and 39 election campaigns. Results In the 2019 Moscow City Duma elections, \\"Smart voting\\"-backed candidates won more votes in total than those of United Russia: 586,286 versus 555,063. Of the 45 seats in the Duma, United Russia won 25, none of which with more than 50% of the vote. According to Alexei Navalny, ‚Äúnow several hundred thousand people have taken part in this. If in the next cycle there will be a couple of million, and in the next - ten million, there will be no ‚ÄúUnited Russia‚Äù. \\" The next single voting day was held on September 13, 2020. During it, 17 heads of constituent entities of Russia were elected as well as deputies of legislative bodies of state power in 11 constituent entities of Russia. In the elections to the Legislative Assembly of the Khabarovsk Krai and the Khabarovsk City Duma, possibly thanks to, among other things, \\"Smart Vote\\", the Liberal Democratic Party won the majority, leaving United Russia with two mandates in the Legislative Assembly. Moreover, in the last elections, United Russia won a majority with 30 mandates. As a result of the Smart Voting in the Tomsk City Duma, United Russia lost its majority and received only 11 seats. During the regional elections in September 2020 due to Smart Voting, United Russia has lost its majority in the city councils of Tomsk, Novosibirsk and Tambov.

Funded primarily by its readers, the magazine emphasizes investigative journalism, reader- journalist interaction, and long format journalism. The magazine editors and founders have also created Project R, an effort to promote the long-term sustainability of high quality journalism in Switzerland. Founding Republik was first established in January 2018, after a record-breaking crowdfunding effort in 2017. The magazine raised 750,0000 Swiss francs and attracted 3,000 new subscribers in the first seven hours following its launch. It raised an additional 3.4 million francs in the next five weeks, and according to the Associated Press, 7.7 million francs by mid-January 2018. Republik is independent and is funded by readers, not advertisement, and accrued over 15,000 subscribers within the first months of opening. The magazine's German-language motto is \\"We can do it together, or not at all.\\" Republik's manifesto states that it is \\"financed without advertising: Our readers are the only customers. And consequently our bosses.\\" The magazine modeled itself after De Correspondent, a Dutch news site. Organization Republik's CEO is Susanne Sugimoto, and its community relations director is Richard Hoechner. The magazine was joined by Swiss journalists Constantin Seibt, Olivia K√ºhni, and Christof Moser, who is also a professor and has served as the magazine's de facto publisher. Sylke Gruhnwald is one of the magazine's editors. In its first year of publication, Republik's staff increased from 10 to 50 empoyees. Journalism Republik publishes between one and three articles every day, focusing on the quality of news rather than quantity. One journalist for the magazine has stated that it tries to emphasize intersectionality in its coverage: viewing a story from a diversity of perspectives or disciplines. After Republik publishes news stories, it hosts live discussion and debate fora with its readers. The magazine's creators and journalists state that critical reader feedback and community is a defining characteristic of their project. The magazine has tended to focus on political and international topics, but has also published an expos√© on construction fraud in a small Swiss town, a report on a controversial Swiss mosque, and tax evasion by the rich in Europe. Republik also published an interview with UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer, discussing the case of Julian Assange. According to the Columbia Journalism Review, Republik has sought to write stories less dominated by US President Donald Trump, and instead focus on Swiss politics. Republik has created a podcast, Klang, that covers opera and classical music. Project R Prior to Republik's launch, its founding team created \\"Project R,\\" a cooperative nonprofit meant to promote the long-term viability of journalism in Switzerland through organization and education. The project remains an important part of the magazine's work. Reception Christine Schmidt at Harvard's Nieman Foundation for Journalism has written that \\"Republik is living up to the hype\\" through investigative journalism, and an online community that allows readers to interact with journalists. According to the Columbia Journalism Review, the magazine's investigative work \\"have given Republik a burgeoning reputation in Switzerland,\\" and earned it praise in Switzerland's Tages-Anzeiger newspaper.

However, his younger brother Mudaffar Sjah, born from a more high-ranking consort, was generally accepted as the heir; he was formally installed in 1986, though unofficially from Jakarta's point of view.Kal Muller (1997), Maluku: Indonesian Spice Islands. Singapore: Periplus, p. 108. The sultanate gained leverage after the end of Suharto's New Order, with a revival of old traditions. However, after Mudaffar Sjah's dead in 2015 a conflict emerged within the sultan's family as to who was the right successor.https://suaramalukudotcom.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/istri-sultan- ternate-tak-ditahan-lagi-pihak-kesultanan-geram/ The late sultan had several sons with different wives, complicating the issue. Eventually Mudaffar's brother Ir. H. Sjarifuddin was enthroned on 4 September 2016 by the dignitaries Kimelaha Tamadi and Kimelaha Marsaoly. The ceremony took place in the Kadato Ico palace in Soa Sio, northern Ternate. It was understood to be a pragmatic agreement in order to put an end to the contest between three sons of Mudaffar.https://suaramalukudotcom.wordpress.com/2016/09/05/sultan-ternate- yang-baru-sudah-dilantik/ Sjarifuddin's role was that of executive sultan (pelaksana sultan) and he did not officiate over some of the ceremonies traditionally associated with Ternatan kingship.https://www.cnnindonesia.com/hiburan/20190512143257-241-394139/ternate- tanpa-sultan-dan-ritual-kolano-uci-sabea-saat-ramadan His time was short since he passed away in Jakarta in 2019, leaving the succession in doubt.

History  The first branch of Comikaza opened on September 15th 2003 in Ramat Aviv in Tel-Aviv by Yossi and Ofra Konijn, a married couple. Prior to the establishment of a brick and mortar store, they operated an online forum and retailer under the domain name comics-net.com. When they realized their was demand, the idea of opening a physical store started taking shape. In 2005 the store relocated from Ramat Aviv to the Dizengoff Center mall in the center of Tel-Aviv. Shortly thereafter, an additional store was opened in the mall named \\"Otaku\\" specializing in the sale of Japanese Manga, Anime and related paraphernalia. In 2013 the store temporarily shut down and was acquired by Jackob Sareli and Ori Ayalon, former customers, who have operated the store ever since under the branding Comikaza 2.0. In 2016 the store was nominated for the Will Eisner Spirit of Comics Retailer Award. The store holds regular signing events by comics creators (such as Neil Gaiman in 2006 or Chip Zdarsky in 2016). Every May it celebrates Free Comic Book Day (FCBD), giving away free comic books for a period of six hours. FCBD is usually held on Fridays in Israel rather than the usual Saturday due to the Shabbath. In 2014 and 2019 the store was nominated for The Diamond Retailer Best Practices Awards for its work on FCBD. On August 5th, 2004, the store announced the release of the official Marvel-sanctioned Hebrew translation of Ultimate Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley, translated by David Chanoch published under the label \\"Comikaza Press\\". Comikaza released a total of 7 issues in Hebrew, collecting the first story arc of the title. The purpose of producing a Hebrew translation for Spider-Man was: \\"...To promote the Israeli comics industry. Our intention is to ensure that many children, who to this day have been reluctant to read comics due to language barriers, will be able to access the book without fear and as a result will begin to express interest in other comics as well.

However, the lack of automation, repeatability and dynamic range of detection in conventional platforms such as FTIR, have been major limitations which have been addressed with the development of microfluidic modulation spectroscopy.  Biophysical characterization analytical techniques  Circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) is a technique for the characterization of secondary structure. CD is useful for Œ±-helical protein analysis due to the intense signal Œ±-helix structures provide in the CD region. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) secondary structure deconvolution is also used for multivariate analysis techniques including singular value decomposition, partial least squares, soft independent modeling of class analogy, and neural networks.S. Vonhoff, J. Condliffe, H. Schiffter J Pharm Biomed Anal, 51 (1) (2010), pp. 39-45 CD, like conventional FTIR, also has major drawbacks. Measurement needs to be carried out at low concentrations, typically at 0.5 mg/mL but down to as low as 0.1 mg/mL, which can undermine the resulting data. The presence of some excipients in the formulation buffer can also interfere with the measurements. CD and conventional FTIR also lack sensitivity in the characterization of biopharmaceuticals proteins such as immunoglobulins IgG1 and IgG2.J. Wen, et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 109 (1) 247‚Äì 253 (2020) Microfluidic modulation spectroscopy is an automated technique that overcomes these challenges of both FTIR and CD for use in biopharmaceutical product characterization.E. Ma, L. Wang, and B. Kendrick, Spectroscopy 33 (7) 46‚Äì52 (2018)  Applications  = Higher order structure assessment = Characterization of protein higher order structures is routinely performed during the biologic product development life cycle.Brent S.Kendrick, John P.Gabrielson, Caroline Warly Solsberg, Eugene Ma, Libo Wang J of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 109 (1), 2020, 933-936 Because biological function is related to structure, it is important to establish that the biologic is manufactured with the expected structure (a monoclonal antibody is created with the expected Œ≤-sheet, Œ±-helix, for example). It is also important to demonstrate that the structure is not significantly impacted by drug substance or drug product manufacturing changes that arise during product development. Microfluidic modulation spectroscopy‚Äôs sensitivity and accuracy, detects higher order structure change in the formulation and at the concentration of interest, without the need for dilution or deuteration. The technique provides information on which structural motifs in the protein molecule are changing, providing more guidance when developing stable protein molecules and formulations. = Biosimilarity = Biosimilar drug development is an important application for higher order structure comparisons. In analytical similarity studies, the higher order structure of the innovator product is compared to the biosimilar to establish similarity in the structures. Comparability and biosimilarity studies often use microfluidic modulation spectroscopy to assess the products for structural differences. The technique reveals very small conformational differences between different proteins, and provides information on where those differences occur. These capabilities make microfluidic modulation spectroscopy a powerful tool in the analysis and development of biosimilars. = Aggregation = Protein aggregation is the process by which proteins start to bind together under different conditions and formulations. If therapeutic proteins are to be safe and efficacious, their misfolding and aggregation behaviors must be well understoodRoberts, CJ. Trends Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 372‚Äì380. Both upstream and downstream processing can cause aggregation, a common indicator of protein instability, which can result in a therapeutic product being unfit for launch. Microfluidic modulation spectroscopy can measure previously undetectable changes in protein structural attributes, changes that are critical to drug efficacy and qualityMa E, Wang L & Kendrick B.

It is one of the only techniques which can directly monitor the formation of aggregates due to its ability to measure intermolecular beta sheet structures. = Formulation development = A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of aggregation is essential to control stability and ensure a safe, effective drug product. A primary motivation in formulation is to understand these mechanisms, which is driven by high throughput analysis and intense information gathering. Formulation scientists use a core set of analytical techniques to quantify the colloidal, chemical and conformational stability parameters that define the stability of a biotherapeutic. However, this is a toolset with widely recognized gaps, notably an inability to measure conformational difference with high reproducibility in clinically representative formulations. For reasons mentioned previously, microfluidic modulation spectroscopy provides the sample capacity through 96 well plate operation and technical capabilities to elucidate colloidal and chemical stability, lacking in existing techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC), mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis. = Quality assurance (GMP/CFR compliant laboratories) = Effective quality testing acts as a safeguard of product quality, controlling critical changes in the structure of drug substances, drug products, raw materials, or excipients. Quality assurance (QA) is a systematic approach that establishes a set of guidelines for all facets of the manufacturing process that could affect product quality. Biologic drugs are complex molecules that exhibit microheterogeneity, minor chemical variances such as glycan structural differences, deamidation, oxidation and glycation. Casting a wide analytical net helps establish the robust structure-function relationships that define the boundaries of unacceptable risk. The identification of all possible critical quality attributes (CQAs) underpin effective QA. Microfluidic modulation spectroscopy facilitates the measurement of secondary structure attributes of biopharmaceuticals in all stages of the manufacturing process. This helps establish quality parameters at stages not possible with traditional techniques. = Quantitation= The structure of proteins and how they behave in solution are affected by concentration. Accurate concentration quantitation yields better analysis and comparison of results between different proteins and formulations. There is no common analytical approach for quantitation due to the constraints of traditional techniques (e.g. the limited dynamic range of traditional spectroscopic tools (for example limited resolution and detector linearity). Because the sample absorbance is targeted to a very limited dynamic range, this forces scientists to make extra steps to adjust either the sample concentration or the cell path length to achieve accurate protein quantitation. Microfluidic modulation spectroscopy provides direct, label free protein quantitation over a wide concentration range and is more selective than traditional spectroscopy instrumentation, with less susceptibility to interferences. Microfluidic modulation spectroscopy increases sensitivity and significantly reduces the errors common with conventional spectroscopy.  Components  Microfluidic modulation spectroscopy features a tunable mid-infrared quantum cascade laser to generate an optical beam that is 1000 times brighter than those used in conventional FTIR. This enables the measurement of samples that are substantially more concentrated than possible with other techniques, and the use of simpler detectors with no requirement for nitrogen cooling. The laser is run in continuous wave mode to generate a very high resolution (< 0.001 cm-1 linewidth), low noise beam with minimal stray light that is focused through a microfluidic transmission cell with a short (25 ¬µm) optical path length onto a thermo-electrically cooled mercury cadmium tellurium (MCT) detector. This optical configuration delivers high sensitivity measurement over a concentration range of 0.1 ‚Äì 200 mg/mL for structural characterization and down to 0.01 mg/mL for protein quantitation giving microfluidic modulation spectroscopy a far wider dynamic range than alternative protein characterization techniques. In microfluidic modulation spectroscopy, the sample (protein-in-buffer) solution and a matching buffer reference stream are introduced into the transmission cell under continuous flow and then rapidly modulated (1-10 Hz) across the laser beam path to produce nearly drift-free, background compensated, differential scans of the Amide I band. The complete optical system is sealed and purged with dry air to minimize any interference from atmospheric water vapor which absorbs across the 2000 ‚Äì 1300 cm-1 wavenumber range and can therefore compromise the use of IR spectroscopy for protein characterization. Advanced signal processing technology is the third key element of the instrument and converts the raw spectra into fractional contribution data for specific motifs of secondary structure, providing a structural fingerprint of the protein.

She and her older sister Kate initially studied singing with Lucy Fosbroke (1836-1870), making their concert d√©but in January 1869 with Fosbroke at Myddelton Hall; in May of that year they again appeared in Lucy Fosbroke‚Äôs own concert where Alice Barth sang Ganz‚Äôs ‚ÄòSince Yesterday‚Äô and with her sister sang the duet ‚ÄòThe Fan‚Äô. Later she studied singing with the tenor Charles Manvers and following the death of her parents within a year of each other she decided to pursue a career as an operatic soprano. In 1871 she was listed as a 'Teacher of Music'.1871 England Census for Alice M Barth, London, Lambeth, Brixton: Ancestry.com After taking lessons from Alberto Randegger among others she launched her career, appearing in burlesques, the concert platform, in operetta and oratorio. In May 1871 at the Royal Polytechnic Institution she sang Irish ballads in John Henry Pepper's production A Trip to the West Highlands of Ireland. She was to return to the Royal Polytechnic Institution frequently over the next 18 months where she became a popular favourite, on another occasion appearing there on the same bill as Pepper himself and George Grossmith. She made her d√©but in English opera at The Crystal Palace in 1873, singing Sally Silver in Satanella and as Donna Elvira in Mozart's Don Giovanni,The Rosa Troupe: Alice Mary Barth, The Carl Rosa Trust Ltd website returning there in September 1874 when she sang in an Offenbach double-bill of Vent du soir, ou L'horrible festin and Rouge et Noir.Crystal Palace Calendar for the Week Ending 26 September 1874, Illustrated London News, 19 September 1874, p. 262: Ancestry.com On 8 October 1874 she married civil engineer Frederick William Usher (1843-1889) at the Old Church in Saint Pancras.Alice Mary Barth, London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754‚Äì1932: Ancestry.com Her marriage resulted in a two- year break in her theatrical career during which she had their son Frank Usher (1876-1912), but by 1876 as 'Madam Barth' she returned to singing, firstly at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the operetta Courtship Under Difficulties before appearing on the concert platform at the Royal Aquarium Theatre, at Freemasons' Hall, St James's Hall and the Brighton Aquarium among others, later returning to The Crystal Palace in August 1877 where she sang Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni. She was in Guy Mannering and was Adina in L'elisir d'amore before taking part in the first English-language performance of Mozart‚Äôs Der Schauspieldirektor in September 1877 which had been adapted into English as The Manager. In the Autumn of 1877 she toured with the Crystal Palace Company before returning to London with them in December that year to appear in Il matrimonio segreto. She next appeared in an English-language opera season at Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre where she appeared as Anne Chute in The Lily of Killarney before playing Arline in The Bohemian Girl. Alice Barth Opera Company Alice Mary Barth After singing engagements in Brighton, Blackpool, Margate and Windsor among other towns, in April 1879 Barth managed a small tour of drawing room operettas including Virginia Gabriel‚Äôs Widows Bewitched, which would become a popular favourite in her repertoire, and Forty Winks, an English-language adaptation of Offenbach's Une nuit blanche. In 1880 she was performing with Sims Reeves in ballad opera and during the early 1880s she was managing her own touring troupe, the Alice Barth Opera Company, which included Richard Temple and Eric Lewis among the cast.Biography of Eric Lewis, Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company Over the next few years Barth's troupe would become well-known on the southern touring circuits while also making regular appearances at The Crystal Palace and Alexandra Palace. In 1880 she added The Sleeping Queen to her Company's repertoire in addition to the Garden Scene from Faust, Mass√©‚Äôs Les noces de Jeannette (adapted as Haste to the Wedding) and Offenbach's The Rose of Auvergne.Michael Musgrave, The Musical Life of the Crystal Palace, Cambridge University Press (1995), p. 178 Between engagements with her own Company Barth joined other small touring companies including that of Traverner and Walsham for whom she appeared at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden and at Hengler's promenade concerts. She sang in Elijah at Lancaster (1880) while in August 1881 she returned to her own Company in the new musical sketch Cross Purposes. When the Royal Polytechnic Institution announced it was closing Barth's Company, they played Widows Bewitched as the venue's final performances in September 1881; she was Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore at the Alexandra Palace in November 1881. In February 1882 at Brighton Barth produced a new work for her Company, Frederick Corder's A Storm in a Teacup.Shun-Liang Chao and John Michael (eds), Romantic Legacies: Transnational and Transdisciplinary Contexts, Routledge (2019) Such was her fame as a drawing room entertainer that Barth was booked by Alfred Reed and Corney Grain to appear as Arabella Upshott in the German Reed Entertainments production of The Head of the Poll at St. George's Hall. During 1882 and 1883 the Alice Barth Opera Company toured Britain playing in such works as Quid pro Quo, The Chalet, Dr Miracle, A Fair Encounter, The Loan of a Lover, The Captain of the Guard and at times a shortened version of Il trovatore. Barth temporarily left her Company to play ‚ÄòMirth, a good fairy‚Äô in the pantomime Beauty and the Beast at the Theatre Royal in Sheffield (1883). She sang in whatever work interested her, irrespective of genre. In 1884 she sang again in the promenade concerts at the Royal Aquarium Theatre, was Wilhelmina in Dibdin's The Waterman in a benefit performance, and with her own Company produced a new operetta, This House to Let at Brighton in June 1884. September of that year saw Barth as co-prima donna opposite Blanche Cole with the Royal English Opera Company, singing Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro, the title role in Maritana, Arline in The Bohemian Girl and Diana in The Crown Diamonds. From May 1885 Barth undertook another tour with her own Company which performed Corder's The Nabob‚Äôs Pickle (1883), Ganymede and Galatea, The Waterman and Corder's The Noble Savage (1885) before she appeared in the pantomime Dick Whittington at Worcester following which she rejoined the Royal English Opera Company for whom she sang Amina in La Sonnambula. In 1887 the Alice Barth Opera Company was touring once again with Gounod‚Äôs La colombe (as The Pet Dove) and Don Pasquale added to the repertoire, but following the sudden death of the Company's principal tenor the tour was forced to close. Alice Barth then joined the English Opera Company for whom she appeared as Arline, Maritana and Susanna. Carl Rosa Opera Company Alice in Wonderland at the Prince of Wales's Theatre (1906) In March 1885 Barth joined the Carl Rosa Opera Company, singing the Countess in Mozart‚Äôs The Marriage of Figaro at the Theatre Royal, Manchester. She was Donna Anna in Don Giovanni in Glasgow and Eily O‚ÄôConnor in The Lily of Killarney at Bradford before joining another Carl Rosa touring company in 1891 as Paquita in Carmen, the Countess in The Daughter of the Regiment and the title role in Maritana before briefly returning to the main Carl Rosa company. In early 1892 she left to appear with the Burns-Crotty Opera Company for whom she sang Clorinda, daughter of Don Magnifico in La Cenerentola under the baton of Henry Wood.Cenerentola (1892), Opera Scotland: Listings & Performance History In August 1894 she returned to the Carl Rosa Opera Company at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool where she played the Nurse in Rom√©o et Juliette by Gounod and created the role of Janet Raistrick in the world premiere of the opera Jeanie Deans by Hamish MacCunn.Tour of Jeanie Deans (1894), Opera Scotland: Listings & Performance History She toured in Hansel and Gretel by Humperdinck in which she variously played Gertrude, the children's mother and the Witch.Tour of Hansel and Gretel (1895), Opera Scotland: Listings & Performance History By the time she left the company in June 1895 she had played 11 roles in 150 performances. She returned to Carl Rosa briefly in October 1895 to sing Lola in Cavalleria Rusticana at the Theatre Royal, Hanley. In 1895 she is said to have married the actor and vocalist Francis William Campbell Bishop (1853-1929), but no trace of a record for the marriage can be found, and in her Probate documents she is named as 'Usher'.1901 England Census for Alice M Bishop, London, St Pancras, Kentish Town: Ancestry.com Later life Following the rise of musical comedy in the 1890s, Barth's career took a new turn in the new genre when in 1895 she accepted the role of Mrs Honeycombe in a lengthy tour of The Gay Parisienne. She made such a success in the character that she was soon offered a similar role, that of Lady Hawser in The French Maid at Terry's Theatre in London. In 1898 Barth played the Duchess and the Red Queen opposite Rose Hersee as Alice in the musical Alice in Wonderland at the Opera Comique in London.Alice in Wonderland (1898), Savile Clarke Alice Productions - Lewis Carroll Resources database In the 1901 census Barth was listed as a 'Teacher of Music', and from about this time she also worked in and around London as a soloist and as the manager of small concert and opera companies, giving up her management role in 1906. During this period she played Mrs Dingle in Skipped by the Light of the Moon (1899); was the Royal Governess in Little Hans Andersen (1903) at the Adelphi Theatre opposite Walter Passmore and Henry Lytton;Wearing, J.
