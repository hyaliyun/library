Any cut determines a cut-set, the set of edges that have one endpoint in each subset of the partition. These edges are said to cross the cut. In a connected graph, each cut-set determines a unique cut, and in some cases cuts are identified with their cut-sets rather than with their vertex partitions. In a flow network, an s‚Äìt cut is a cut that requires the source and the sink to be in different subsets, and its cut-set only consists of edges going from the source's side to the sink's side. The capacity of an s‚Äìt cut is defined as the sum of the capacity of each edge in the cut-set. Definition A cut C=(S,T) is a partition of V of a graph G=(V,E) into two subsets S and T. The cut-set of a cut C=(S,T) is the set \\\\\\\\{(u,v)\\\\in E \\\\mid u\\\\in S, v \\\\in T\\\\\\\\} of edges that have one endpoint in S and the other endpoint in T. If s and t are specified vertices of the graph G, then an s‚Äìt cut is a cut in which s belongs to the set S and t belongs to the set T. In an unweighted undirected graph, the size or weight of a cut is the number of edges crossing the cut. In a weighted graph, the value or weight is defined by the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut. A bond is a cut-set that does not have any other cut-set as a proper subset. Minimum cut A minimum cut. A cut is minimum if the size or weight of the cut is not larger than the size of any other cut. The illustration on the right shows a minimum cut: the size of this cut is 2, and there is no cut of size 1 because the graph is bridgeless. The max-flow min-cut theorem proves that the maximum network flow and the sum of the cut-edge weights of any minimum cut that separates the source and the sink are equal. There are polynomial-time methods to solve the min-cut problem, notably the Edmonds‚ÄìKarp algorithm.. Maximum cut A maximum cut. A cut is maximum if the size of the cut is not smaller than the size of any other cut. The illustration on the right shows a maximum cut: the size of the cut is equal to 5, and there is no cut of size 6, or E (the number of edges), because the graph is not bipartite (there is an odd cycle). In general, finding a maximum cut is computationally hard.. The max-cut problem is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems.. The max-cut problem is also APX-hard, meaning that there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme for it unless P = NP.. However, it can be approximated to within a constant approximation ratio using semidefinite programming.. Note that min-cut and max-cut are not dual problems in the linear programming sense, even though one gets from one problem to other by changing min to max in the objective function. The max-flow problem is the dual of the min-cut problem..  Sparsest cut  The sparsest cut problem is to bipartition the vertices so as to minimize the ratio of the number of edges across the cut divided by the number of vertices in the smaller half of the partition. This objective function favors solutions that are both sparse (few edges crossing the cut) and balanced (close to a bisection). The problem is known to be NP-hard, and the best known approximation algorithm is an O(\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}) approximation due to ..  Cut space The family of all cut sets of an undirected graph is known as the cut space of the graph. It forms a vector space over the two- element finite field of arithmetic modulo two, with the symmetric difference of two cut sets as the vector addition operation, and is the orthogonal complement of the cycle space... If the edges of the graph are given positive weights, the minimum weight basis of the cut space can be described by a tree on the same vertex set as the graph, called the Gomory‚ÄìHu tree.. Each edge of this tree is associated with a bond in the original graph, and the minimum cut between two nodes s and t is the minimum weight bond among the ones associated with the path from s to t in the tree.

It was formerly known as the X3 and NCITS. INCITS is the central U.S. forum dedicated to creating technology standards. INCITS is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and is affiliated with the Information Technology Industry Council, a global policy advocacy organization that represents U.S. and global innovation companies. INCITS coordinates technical standards activity between ANSI in the US and joint ISO/IEC committees worldwide. This provides a mechanism to create standards that will be implemented in many nations. As such, INCITS' executive board also serves as ANSI's Technical Advisory Group for ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1. JTC 1 is responsible for International standardization in the field of information technology. INCITS operates through consensus. Many times, the U.S. standard that INCITS members develop then will become the baseline standard for the international community. Governance INCITS is guided by its executive board. The INCITS executive board established more than 50 Technical Committees, Task Groups and Study Groups that are constantly developing standards for new technologies and updating standards for older products. Standards development More than 750 standards have been created and approved through the INCITS process, with another 800 in development. American National Standards are voluntary and serve U.S. interests well because all materially affected stakeholders have the opportunity to work together to create them. INCITS-approved standards only become mandatory when, and if, they are adopted or referenced by the government or when market forces make them imperative. Given the responsibilities and the expenditures associated with U.S. participation in international standards activities, INCITS considers participation as a \\"P\\" member of ISO/IEC JTC 1, as a declaration of support for the international committee's technical work. INCITS policy is to adopt as \\"Identical\\" American National Standards all ISO/IEC or ISO standards that fall within its program of work, with exceptions as outlined in our procedures. Accordingly, INCITS will adopt as \\"Identical\\" American National Standards all ISO/IEC or ISO standards that fall within its program of work. Similarly, INCITS will withdraw any such adopted American National Standard that has been withdrawn as an ISO/IEC or ISO International Standards. History INCITS was established in 1961 as the Accredited Standards Committee X3, Information Technology'and is sponsored by Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), a trade association representing providers of information technology products and services then known as the Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (BEMA) and later renamed the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association (CBEMA). The first organizational meeting was in February 1961 with ITI (CBEMA then) taking Secretariat responsibility. X3 was established under American National Standards Institute (ANSI) procedures. The forum was renamed Accredited Standards Committee NCITS, National Committee for Information Technology Standards in 1997, and the current name was approved in 2001.

The area was first developed between the mid-1980s and early 1990s as an expansion of the Darnytsia neighborhood of the city. The name is rather symbolic than historic: it simply indicates that the area lies en route to the city of Kharkiv. Formal subordination The neighborhood was a part of the Kharkivskyi Raion (administrative district) of the city until 2004, along with the neighboring areas Osokorky, Poznyaky, Bortnychi and Chervonyi Hutir - which was and still is a little ambiguous. In 2004 all these neighborhoods were included in the Darnytsia Raion. Architecture and infrastructure Kharkivska Square Located on the south end of the Dnieper river's left bank, the Kharkivskyi was constructed following similar apartment block plans as the Obolon district. The very same method of sand-depositing was used to level and elevate the low-land meadows. The neighborhood has many lakes and the beaches are a popular attraction. However, the trees are rare and weak (because of the sand soil) despite intensive efforts of the residents. Originally located relatively far from the metro, the neighborhood was not seen as prestigious, but the long waiting list for apartments caused quick settlement. At the time of initial development, the area contained relatively tall buildings, anywhere from nine to sixteen stories. In the early to mid-1990s, the metro was extended to better cover the neighbourhood. Osokorky () station was opened in 1992 and Kharkivska () station was opened in 1994 . Like in other areas of Kyiv, additional development began in Kharkivskyi in 2000. Modern, Western-style apartment buildings were built around the lakes, usually further towards the south and east ends of the neighborhood. The prestige of the area was also increased with the opening of shops, restaurants and cafes on and around the lakes as well as on the ground floors of apartment buildings. The metro is being extended deeper into the neighborhood, with new Boryspilska station opened in 2005, and a few more stations which were added subsequently. Economy Kharkivskyi is a 'dormitory' area specially designed as such. The only businesses found there are retail and entertainment, with no industry present.

Life =Revolution= Born at Messancy in Luxembourg on 3 July 1805, he was educated at the Ath√©n√©e de Luxembourg and the University of Li√®ge, and was in Luxemburg when the Revolution of August broke out, but was nominated a member of the commission appointed to draw up the Constitution. Nothomb became a member of the national congress, and became secretary-general of the ministry of foreign affairs under √ârasme-Louis Surlet de Chokier. He supported the candidature of the Orl√©anist Louis, Duke of Nemours, and joined in the proposal to offer the crown to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, being one of the delegates sent to London. When the Eighteen Articles of the Treaty of London were replaced by the Twenty-four less favorable to Belgium, he insisted on the necessity of compliance, and in 1839 he faced violent opposition to support the territorial cessions in Limburg and Luxemburg, which had remained an open question so long as the Netherlands refused to acknowledge the Twenty-four Articles. =Later life= His Essai historique et politique sur la r√©volution belge (1838) won for him the praise of Palmerston and the cross of the Legion of Honor from French king Louis Philippe. In 1837 he became minister of public works, and to him was largely due the rapid development of the Belgian railway system, and the increase in the mining industry. In 1840 he was sent as Belgian envoy to the German Confederation, and in 1841, on the fall of the Lebeau ministry, he organized the new cabinet, reserving for himself the portfolio of minister of the interior. In 1845 he was defeated, and retired from the Belgian Parliament, but he held a number of diplomatic appointments before his death in Berlin.

It was first published by Time magazine on May 6, 1991, as an eight-page cover story, and was later published in Reader's Digest in October 1991. Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in Forbes magazine. He stated that he was investigated by attorneys and private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology while researching the Time article, and that investigators contacted his friends and family as well. Behar's article covers topics including L. Ron Hubbard and the development of Scientology, its controversies over the years and history of litigation, conflict with psychiatry and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the suicide of Noah Lottick, its status as a religion, and its business dealings. After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology mounted a public relations campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he considered to be an objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001. Behar received awards in honor of his work on the article, including the Gerald Loeb Award, the Worth Bingham Prize, and the Conscience-in-Media Award. The article has had ramifications in the current treatment of Scientology in the media, with some publications theorizing that journalists are wary of the litigation that Time Warner went through. The article has been cited by Anderson Cooper on CNN, in a story on Panorama 2007 program \\"Scientology and Me\\" on the BBC, and has been used as a reference for background on the history of Scientology, in books from both the cult and new religious movement perspectives. Research for the article U.S. President George H. W. Bush congratulates Richard Behar upon his receiving the Worth Bingham Prize for writing the Time article (1992). Before penning \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\", Behar had written a 1986 article in Forbes magazine, \\"The Prophet and Profits of Scientology\\", which reported on the Church of Scientology's business dealings and L. Ron Hubbard's financial success. Behar wrote that during research for \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\", he and a Time contributing editor were themselves investigated by ten attorneys and six private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology. According to Behar, investigators contacted his friends and previous coworkers to ask them if he had a history of tax or drug problems, and obtained a copy of his personal credit report that had been obtained illegally from a national credit bureau. Behar conducted 150 interviews in the course of his research for the article. Behar wrote that the motive of these operatives was to \\"threaten, harass and discredit him\\". He later learned that the Church of Scientology had assigned its head private investigator to direct the Church's investigation into Behar. Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ reported that Behar had been contacted by Church of Scientology attorneys numerous times while doing research on the article. The parents of Noah Lottick, a Scientologist who had committed suicide, cooperated with Time and Reader's Digest. Synopsis The full title of the article is \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power: Ruined lives. Lost fortunes. Federal crimes. Scientology poses as a religion but is really a ruthless global scam ‚Äî and aiming for the mainstream\\". The article reported on the founding of the Church of Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard and controversies involving the Church and its affiliated business operations, as well as the suicide of a Scientologist. The article related the May 11, 1990, suicide of Dr. Edward Lottick's son Noah Antrim Lottick. Lottick was a Russian studies student who had taken a series of Scientology courses; he died after jumping from a hotel tenth floor window. The Church of Scientology and Lottick's family have differing positions on the effect Scientology coursework had on him. While none of the parties assigned blame, they expressed misgivings about his death. Initially, his father had thought that Scientology was similar to Dale Carnegie's self-improvement techniques; however, after his ordeal, the elder Lottick came to believe that the organization is a \\"school for psychopaths\\". Mike Rinder, the head of the Church of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs and a Church spokesman, stated \\"I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror ... I think Ed Lottick made his son's life intolerable\\". The article outlined a brief history of Scientology, discussing Hubbard's initial background as a science fiction writer, and cited a California judge who had deemed Hubbard a \\"pathological liar\\". The Church of Scientology's litigation history was described, in addition to its conflicts with the Internal Revenue Service, with countries regarding whether or not to accept it as a religion, and its position against psychiatry. Behar wrote of the high costs involved in participation in the Church of Scientology, what he referred to as \\"front groups and financial scams\\", and harassment of critics. He estimated that the Church of Scientology paid US$20 million annually to over one hundred attorneys. Behar maintained that though the Church of Scientology portrays itself as a religion, it was actually a \\"hugely profitable global racket\\" which intimidated members and critics in a Mafia-like manner. Cynthia Kisser, then director of the Cult Awareness Network, was quoted: \\"Scientology is quite likely the most ruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most litigious and the most lucrative cult the country has ever seen. No cult extracts more money from its members\\". Post-publication =Church of Scientology's response= The Church of Scientology responded to the publication of \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\" by taking out color full-page ads in USA Today in May and June 1991, on every weekday for twelve weeks, denouncing the Time magazine cover article. Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled \\"Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991, Issues of Time Magazine\\", and \\"The Story That Time Couldn't Tell\\". Prior to the advertising campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article. The \\"Fact vs. Fiction\\" piece was a booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted \\"Behar's article omits the information on the dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists ... which have been acknowledged by community officials\\". One of the advertisements in USA Today accused Time of promoting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and featured a 1936 issue of Time which had Hitler's picture on the front cover. The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning Time \\"horrible history of supporting fascism\\", and said that the article was written because Time had been pressured by \\"vested interests\\". When asked by the St. Petersburg Times whether this was the case, Time Executive Editor Richard Duncan responded \\"Good Lord, no\\". Heber Jentzsch, at the time president of Church of Scientology International, issued a four-page news release which stated \\"Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of getting its message and its side of the story out to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it\\". After the advertising run critiquing Time magazine in USA Today had completed, the Church of Scientology mounted a $3 million public relations campaign about Scientology in USA Today, in June 1991. The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8 million copies of USA Today. In a statement to the St. Petersburg Times, Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained \\"What we are trying to do is put the actual facts of Dianetics and Scientology out there\\". In response to the Church of Scientology's claims of inaccuracies in the article, a lawyer for Time responded \\"We've reviewed all of their allegations, and find nothing wrong with the Time story.\\" In June 1991, Newsweek reported that staffers for Time said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a paralegal for Time, who asked them if they had signed a confidentiality form about the article. Time editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers told Newsweek that \\"sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time\\". A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims \\"scurrilous\\". On February 14, 1992, Scientology leader David Miscavige gave Ted Koppel his first interview on Scientology on the ABC News program Nightline. The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar appeared on the program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the organization's \\"ulterior motive\\" is really to get people to take high-priced audit counseling. Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records. Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the Time magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in USA Today. Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the Time article, and the rest of the twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the Time article, and Miscavige called Behar \\"a hater\\". Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the Time piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to \\"kidnap Scientologists out\\". Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was \\"missing the issue\\", and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece. Miscavige alleged on Nightline that the article itself was published as a result of a request by Eli Lilly and Company, because of \\"the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac\\". When Koppel asked Miscavige if he had affidavits or evidence to this effect, Miscavige responded \\"You think they'd admit it?\\" Miscavige stated that \\"Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000 copies of Time magazine before it came out\\", and that his attempts to investigate the matter with Eli Lilly and associated advertising companies were not successful. =Litigation= Docket of Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner, Inc., Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States denied. The Church brought a libel lawsuit against Time Warner and Behar, seeking damages of $416 million. The Church alleged false and defamatory statements were made concerning the Church of Scientology International in the Time article. More specifically, the Church of Scientology's court statements claimed that Behar had been refining an anti-Scientology focus since his 1986 article in Forbes, which included gathering negative materials about Scientology, and \\"never accepting anything a Scientologist said and uniformly ignoring anything positive he learned about the Church\\". In its initial complaint filing, the Church quoted portions of the Behar article that it alleged were false and defamatory, including the quote from Cynthia Kisser, and Behar's own assertion that Scientology was a \\"global racket\\" that intimidated individuals in a \\"Mafia-like manner\\". U.S. federal court proceedings, in case Church of Scientology International vs. Time Warner Inc. and Richard Behar Noah Lottick's parents submitted affidavits in the case, in which they \\"affirmed the accuracy of each statement in the article\\"; Edward Lottick \\"concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations, and that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral\\" of their son. During the litigation, the Church of Scientology attempted to subpoena Behar in a separate ongoing lawsuit with the Internal Revenue Service, and accused a federal magistrate of leaking information to him. Behar was questioned for over 190 hours during 30 days of depositions with Scientology attorneys in the libel case. One question was about Behar's life in his parents' home while he was still inside the womb. St. Petersburg Times explained that this question was prompted by Scientology teachings that certain problems come from prenatal memories. Behar told the St. Petersburg Times he \\"felt it was extremely excessive\\". In a countersuit, Behar brought up the issues of Church of Scientology private investigators and what he viewed as harassment. By July 1996, all counts of the libel suit had been dismissed. In the course of the litigation through 1996, Time Warner had spent $7.3 million in legal defense costs. The Church of Scientology also sued several individuals quoted in the Time article. The Church of Scientology sued Reader's Digest in Switzerland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany for publishing a condensed version of the Time story. The only court to provide a temporary injunction was in Lausanne, Switzerland. In France, Italy, and the Netherlands, the courts either dismissed the Church of Scientology's motions, or set injunction hearings far beyond the date of actual publication. The company defied the injunction and mailed copies of the article, \\"Scientology: A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream\\", to their . Worldwide editor- in-chief of Reader's Digest, Kenneth Tomlinson, told The New York Times that \\"a publisher cannot accept a court prohibiting distribution of a serious journalistic piece. ... The court order violates freedom of speech and freedom of the press\\". The Church of Scientology subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the Digest in Lausanne, and Mike Rinder stated it was in blatant violation of the law. By defying the Swiss court ban, the Reader's Digest risked a fine of about $3,400, as well as a potential three months' jail time for the Swiss Digest editor-in-chief. A hearing on the injunction was set for November 11, 1991, and the injunction was later lifted by the Swiss court. Certiorari record in United States Reports In January 2001, a United States federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\" with an actual intent of malice, a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups. On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc., 00-1683. Time Warner said it refused to be \\"intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources.\\" In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had \\"committed improper acts\\" in the past, but also claimed that: \\"allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, the result of the misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion\\". Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they \\"provide a safe harbor for biased journalism\\". Behar commented on the Church of Scientology's legal defeat, and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect: \\"It's a tremendous defeat for Scientology ... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from that perspective they hurt us all. They've had a real chilling effect on journalism, both before and after my piece\\". =Awards= As a result of writing the piece, Behar was presented with the 1992 Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished business and financial journalism, the Worth Bingham Prize, the Conscience-in-Media Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors, awarded to \\"those who have demonstrated singular commitment to the highest principles of journalism at notable personal cost or sacrifice,\\" and the Cult Awareness Network's Leo J. Ryan Award, in honor of Congressman Leo J. Ryan. Paulette Cooper was also awarded the 1992 Conscience-in-Media Award by the American Society of Journalists and Authors, for her book The Scandal of Scientology. This was the only time in the history of the American Society of Journalists and Authors that the award was presented to more than one journalist in the same year. In a February 1992 issue of Time, editor Elizabeth Valk congratulated Behar on his Conscience-in- Media Award, stating \\"Needless to say, we are delighted and proud\\". Valk noted that the honor had only been awarded seven times in the previous seventeen years of its existence. Managing editor Henry Muller also congratulated Behar in an April 1992 issue of Time. Analysis Insane Therapy noted that Scientology \\"achieved more notoriety ... with the publication of the journalist Richard Behar's highly critical article\\". Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality described the cover design of the article as it appeared in Time, writing that it \\"shouted\\" the headline from the magazine cover. In a 2005 piece, Salon.com magazine noted that for those interested in the Church of Scientology, the Time article still remains a \\"milestone in news coverage\\", and that those who back the Church believe it was \\"an outrageously biased account\\". Legacy The Church of Scientology's use of private investigators was cited in a 1998 article in the Boston Herald, and compared to Behar's experiences when researching \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\". After the paper ran a five-part series of critical articles in 1998, Church of Scientology President Heber Jentzsch confirmed that a private investigative firm was hired to look into the personal life of Joseph Mallia, the reporter who wrote the articles. In a later piece titled \\"Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter‚ÄîInvestigation follows pattern of harassment\\" this investigation was likened to Behar's assertions of harassment, as well as other reporters' experiences from 1974, 1988, and 1997. Because of the history of conflict between Reader's Digest and Scientology, the writer of a 2005 cover story on Tom Cruise agreed to certain demands, including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer's profile of Cruise, submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers, and sending the writer of the article to a one-day Church immersion course. Also in 2005, an article in Salon questioned whether the tactics of the Church's litigation and private investigations of Time Warner and other media sources had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press. A 2005 article in The Sunday Times cited the article, and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology's lawsuit against Time Warner \\"served to warn off other potential investigations\\", and that \\"The chill evidently lingers still\\". \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\" continues to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology. In April 2007, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper interviewed former Office of Special Affairs director Mike Rinder, in a live piece on Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ titled \\"Inside Scientology\\". The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a BBC Panorama investigative program, \\"Scientology and Me\\". In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\" article, when asking Rinder about the history of Operation Snow White, and if those tactics were currently used by the Church. Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was \\"ancient history\\". Cooper then again referenced the Time magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article. Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against Time Warner, and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually rejected. The article has been cited as a reference used for background on Scientology in books which take a critical look at cults such as Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality and Insane Therapy: Portrait of a Psychotherapy Cult, those that analyze new religious movements including Understanding New Religious Movements and The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements, and in a work that includes researchers from both schools of thought, Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field.

It was originally formulated as a conjecture in 1908 by Ernst Steinitz and Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze, but it is now known to be wrong. The non-manifold version was disproved by John Milnor in 1961 using Reidemeister torsion. History The manifold version is true in dimensions m\\\\le 3. The cases m = 2 and 3 were proved by Tibor Rad√≥ and Edwin E. Moise in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively. An obstruction to the manifold version was formulated by Andrew Casson and Dennis Sullivan in 1967‚Äì69 (originally in the simply-connected case), using the Rochlin invariant and the cohomology group H^3(M;\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}). A homeomorphism f \\\\colon N \\\\to M of m-dimensional piecewise linear manifolds has an invariant \\\\kappa(f) \\\\in H^3(M;\\\\Z/2\\\\Z) such that for m \\\\ge 5, f is isotopic to a piecewise linear (PL) homeomorphism if and only if \\\\kappa(f) = 0. In the simply-connected case and with m \\\\ge 5, f is homotopic to a PL homeomorphism if and only if [\\\\kappa(f)] = 0 \\\\in [M,G/{\\\\rm PL}]. The obstruction to the manifold Hauptvermutung is now seen as a relative version of the triangulation obstruction of Robion Kirby and Laurent C. Siebenmann, obtained in 1970. The Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann obstruction is defined for any compact m-dimensional topological manifold M :\\\\kappa(M)\\\\in H^4(M;\\\\Z/2\\\\Z) again using the Rochlin invariant. For m\\\\ge 5, the manifold M has a PL structure (i.e., it can be triangulated by a PL manifold) if and only if \\\\kappa(M) = 0, and if this obstruction is 0, the PL structures are parametrized by H^3(M;\\\\Z/2\\\\Z). In particular there are only a finite number of essentially distinct PL structures on M. For compact simply-connected manifolds of dimension 4, Simon Donaldson found examples with an infinite number of inequivalent PL structures, and Michael Freedman found the E8 manifold which not only has no PL structure, but (by work of Casson) is not even homeomorphic to a simplicial complex. In 2013, Ciprian Manolescu proved that there exist compact topological manifolds of dimension 5 (and hence of any dimension greater than 5) that are not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex. Thus Casson's example illustrates a more general phenomenon that is not merely limited to dimension 4.

According to comics historian Jerry Bails, Sprang worked throughout the 1930s for Standard Magazines, \\"screening scripts\\" as an editor, as well as contributing artwork to Standard, Columbia Publications and Street and Smith, while still in high school. He joined the staff of \\"the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain in Toledo, Ohio\\" shortly after graduating (circa 1934), continuing to produce magazine work concurrently. Sprang described his early career and work ethic, in 1987: He left the newspaper in 1936 to move to New York City,Desris, Joe. Biography in Batman Archives, Volume 3 (DC Comics, 1994), p. 223 where he began \\"illustrating for the pulp magazines‚Äîthe Western, detective, and adventure magazines in the era of the late 1930s\\". From the late 1930s to the early 1940s, Sprang continued to work as a freelance illustrator, primarily for such pulp magazines as Popular Detective, Popular Western, Phantom Detective, G-Men, Detective Novels Magazine, Crack Detective and Black Hood Detective/Hooded Detective, for which last he also wrote some stories. Between 1937 and 1938, Sprang provided assistance on the King Features Syndicate comic strips Secret Agent X-9 (layouts) and The Lone Ranger (pencil assists). In 1938, he also wrote briefly for the Lone Ranger radio series. Late in the decade, with the pulp magazines in decline,*Dick Sprang at the Lambiek Comiclopedia. Accessed May 9, 2008 Sprang gravitated toward comic-book illustration. With Norman Fallon and Ed Kressey, he co-founded the studio Fallon-Sprang at \\"a little studio loft on 42nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Grand Central\\" Terminal and with a contact address of 230 West 101st Street in Manhattan.\\"Spotlight on Dick Sprang, Part One: An Interview with One of the Greatest of Golden Age 'Batman' Illustrators\\" Alter Ego #19 (Dec. 2002), p. 5 A promotional flier advertises the studio as comics packagers for such \\"supermen\\" features as \\"Power Nelson\\" (introduced in Prize Comics #1, March 1940) and \\"Shock Gibson\\"; \\"human interest\\" features such as \\"Speed Martin\\"; and the \\"interplanetary\\" feature \\"Sky Wizard\\" and detective feature \\"K-7\\" (both introduced in Hillman Periodicals' Miracle Comics #1, Feb. 1940, and attributed to Emile Schurmacher).Miracle Comics #1 (Feb. 1940) at the Grand Comics Database =DC Comics and Batman= Continuing to seek comic-book work, Sprang submitted art samples to DC Comics editor Whitney Ellsworth, who assigned him a Batman story in 1941. Anticipating that Batman creator Bob Kane would be drafted to serve in World War II, DC inventoried Sprang's work to safeguard against delays. Sprang's first published Batman work was the Batman and Robin figures on the cover of Batman #18 (Aug.-Sept. 1943), reproduced from the art for page 13 of the later-published Detective Comics #84 (Feb. 1944).Verified by Sprang at Batman #18 (Aug.-Sept. 1943) and Detective Comics #84 (Feb. 1944) at the Grand Comics Database Sprang's first original published Batman work, and first interior-story work, appeared in Batman #19 (Oct.-Nov. 1943), for which he penciled and inked the cover and the first three Batman stories, and penciled the fourth Batman story, inked by Norm Fallon.Verified by Sprang at Batman #19 (Oct.-Nov. 1943) at the Grand Comics Database Like all Batman artists of the time, Sprang went uncredited as a ghost artist for Kane. In May of 1944, Sprang married commercial artist and photographer Lora Ann Neusiis in New York City.\\"Fremont Society Events,\\" The Fremont News-Messenger, May 10, 1944 The couple moved west to Sedona, Arizona, in 1946. They were divorced in 1951 and Lora returned to New York City.http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/nau/Sprang_Richard.xml Sprang thereafter worked almost entirely on Batman comics and covers and on the Batman newspaper strip, becoming one of the primary Batman artists in the character's first 20 years. In 1955, Sprang got the chance to draw Superman, when he replaced Curt Swan as the primary artist for the Superman/Batman team- up stories in World's Finest Comics, on which he worked until his retirement in 1963. Sprang also worked on a couple of stories for the main Superman comic, \\"including the tale that introduced the first, prototype Supergirl\\". Sprang's work was first reprinted in 1961, and \\"nearly all subsequent Batman collections have contained at least one of his efforts.\\" However, his name never appeared on his Batman work during his career, due to stipulations in Bob Kane's contract. These stated that Kane's name would remain on the strip, regardless of whether he drew any particular story, and this restriction remained in place until the mid-1960s. It was subsequently revealed, however, that Sprang was Kane's favorite \\"ghost\\". Comics historian Les Daniels wrote that Sprang's \\"clean line and bold sense of design\\" set him apart as \\"the supreme stylist\\" of the early Batman artists. Sprang used to study the way children read comics in order to experiment with page layouts and panel to panel transitions, hoping to create \\"the most suspense and the most fluidity to keep the pages turning\\".Daniels, p. 50 Daniels singles out Sprang's work on the 1948 debut of the Riddler as \\"a superb example of story breakdown and page design\\".Daniels, p. 56. The tardiness of Sprang's friend and frequent collaborator Bill Finger sometimes produced situations in which he would have to send in pencils for a story before the ending had been written, actions that \\"required some careful figuring\\".Daniels, p. 69. In Batman #34, \\"Sprang drew Batman and Robin capering across....Mount Rushmore\\", over a decade before Alfred Hitchcock filmed a similar scene in North by Northwest.Daniels, p. 65. One story drawn by Sprang, \\"Joker's Millions\\", was adapted into an episode of Batman: The Animated Series. =Lora Sprang= During the time that Dick Sprang began illustrating Batman, he taught his wife, Lora A. Sprang, to letter, and she subsequently lettered most (and colored some) of his subsequent work under the pen name \\"Pat Gordon\\".Desris, p. 222 In addition to lettering (and coloring) her husband's artwork, Lora Sprang also worked freelance as a photographer for Film Fun magazine, \\"hand-lettered titles for industrial films,\\" worked on the titles of Navy training films during World War II, and produced theatrical posters for 20th Century Fox. During the 1950s, \\"Gordon\\" continued to letter for DC on stories featuring Superman, Batman, Superboy and others, before leaving the company circa 1961. =Later life and recognition= The Sprangs moved to Sedona, Arizona in 1946, where he became interested in western pioneer trails. He spent much of his spare time between 1946 and 1963 surveying the northern Arizona and southern Utah area, especially Glen Canyon (before it was flooded). Sprang's first river trip in Glen was in 1950, and he and Lora divorced in 1951. Also in 1951, Dick made a two week river trip and a five week river trip, both in Glen Canyon. In 1952 on a six week Glen Canyon river trip along with Harry Aleson and Dudy Thomas, Sprang discovered the \\"Defiance House\\", an ancestral Puebloan structure believed to have been previously unseen by non-Natives. Dudy Thomas had explored the western United States extensively and accompanied Sprang and Aleson on multiple trips through Glen Canyon by raft in the early-mid 1950s. Thomas and Sprang were married in 1956. In 1956, he and Dudy moved to Torrey, Utah, and the next spring moved to nearby Fish Creek Ranch on where they ran cattle. Dudy passed away in January of 1958 and Sprang remarried that year to Elizabeth Lewis. In 1959, the two made a six week river run of Glen Canyon. They ran Glen one more time in 1961 before Glen was flooded by the reservoir named Lake Powell, created by Glen Canyon Dam. Sprang was also interested in photography and became a noted expert in the field of western pioneer trails; Sprang's voice can be heard on several National Park Service oral history tapes. \\"History Over The Dam,\\" Arizona Republic, September 2, 1956\\"Sedona News,\\" Arizona Daily Sun, January 9, 1958 In 1963, Sprang retired from full- time comics illustrating. He and Elizabeth were divorced in 1972 and Sprang relocated from Utah to Prescott, Arizona that year. Sprang married Marion Lyday in 1973 and the two remained in Prescott until his death in 2000. Marion Sprang died in 2001.http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/nau/Sprang_Richard.xml Mostly unknown to comics readers during his career‚Äîuncredited on Batman and Superman, Sprang placed his name only on a handful of other stories that he drew, such as in Real Fact Comics‚ÄîSprang began to receive notice from comics fandom in the 1970s, when he became a regular attendee at comic conventions and later began drawing and selling reproductions of his Golden Age comics covers.CFA-APA #13, reprinted in Alter Ego #19, p. 12 During the 1980s (c. 1984‚Äì87) he devoted some of his time to recreating comic book material for the burgeoning collector's market, before returning to comics in 1987 for \\"occasional assignments\\".

Sometimes called \\"the twin caves\\" because they are within of each other, the two caves maintain a year-round temperature of 58 ¬∞F, contain more formations per foot than any other caves in Arkansas, and are open for public tours year-round except during the January flooding season. A third cave on the site, Not Much Sink cavern, has been deemed too dangerous to allow public tours. Mystic Caverns, which has operated commercially since the late 1920s, is older than any other commercially operated cave in Arkansas, with the exception of Onyx Cave in Eureka Springs, and perhaps nearby Diamond Cave in Jasper, which has been toured since 1925. Crystal Dome was discovered in the mid-1960s during landscaping operations at Dogpatch USA. Great care was taken to preserve this pristine cave, and as a result 90% of it is still being formed. Tours began in the Crystal Dome in 1981.  History  The area was settled in the 1830s and named \\"Wilcockson\\". At that time the entrance to the as-yet-unnamed Mystic Caverns was a sinkhole which led to a drop into the cave itself. It is likely that settlers became aware of the cave and visited it prior to the 1850s. However, the first known visitor to the cave carved his name and the date on one of the formations: > Adam Kolbe > Wilcockson > April 16, 1919 The cave was first given the name \\"Mansion Cave\\", date unknown, for its huge open chambers, and around 1928 the first commercial tours were offered to the public. Owned by Jim and Bob Gurley, who constructed a wooden ladder down into the sinkhole and leveled the floor for trails, the tours were guided by the use of kerosene lanterns for illumination. They renamed the cave \\"Wild Horse Cavern\\" and stationed a hand carved horse next to the ticket booth. In 1930 the cave was purchased by a man named Singer who continued to operate it commercially, and issued each visitor a pair of coveralls and a kerosene lantern. Most of the soot damage to the cave was caused during this period. From 1937 to 1938 the cave was owned by Jerry Cannon and managed by Mose Arnold, who replaced the ladder with concrete steps and hung a rope next to the steps to aid visitors as they descended into the cave. In 1938 commercial visitation to the cave was halted by an unidentified Arkansas state official; the dangerous condition of the steps and the probability of rock slides near the entrance to the cave were the likely reasons. From 1938 until 1949 the cave was unsupervised and frequently visited by the local residents. During this period the cave was damaged to a great extent by vandals who carried away pieces of the formations and sold them to commercial rock dealers. In 1949 the cave was bought by Albert Raney Sr., who owned a nearby trout farm. The local highway was being paved for the first time, and Raney, who saw great potential for the cave as a tourist attraction, removed all the accumulated debris that had gathered over the years, created a safer spiral path down the sinkhole entrance to the cave and added steps where the path became too steep. He also added hand rails, leveled the trails and covered them with lime which hardened to provide better footing, installed the first electric lighting system inside the cave, and built a new ticket booth (which was eventually destroyed in a fire in 1984). The cave was renamed \\"Mystic Caverns\\" and reopened for public tours in 1950. In 1959 Albert Raney Sr. handed the responsibility of the enterprise to his son Albert Raney Jr. He would continue to manage the cave's operations with the help of his family and friends until 1984. In 1966, the cave was purchased, along with the Raney's trout pond, by the developers of Dogpatch USA, a theme park based on Al Capp's Li'l Abner comic strip, and was intended to be incorporated into the park's attractions. Development of the area began around and within the cave. Jim Schermerhorn, an experienced caver, and original shareholder of Dogpatch, supervised the work. Originally, the cave had some potentially dangerous problems. The first visitors had to hike up and down Mill Creek canyon to reach the entrance. Later, a rickety swinging bridge had been constructed over the canyon eliminating the exhausting hike, but creating a new danger. Also, the sinkhole entrance was still quite dangerous. Schermerhorn would have a safer road across the canyon built and a new man-made entrance to the cave constructed. Other improvements included a new parking lot, landscaping around the cave, and a new ticket office and gift shop. The trails within the cave were slightly altered and replaced with stone. Also, pipe welded hand rails, and a new indirect lighting system was added. During construction of the new parking lot, while Jim Schermerhorn was operating a bulldozer, a new sinkhole opened up leading to an enormous previously unknown cavern. The cave was named \\"Old Man Moses Cave\\" after a Li'l Abner cartoon character. Being an experienced caver, Schermerhorn realized the importance of preserving the pristine cave never before seen or touched by human hands. He camped out at the entrance of the cave until it could be blocked off from visitors. In 1968, Mystic Caverns reopened under the name \\"Dogpatch Caverns\\". \\"Old Man Moses Cave\\" was supposed to open eventually as well as a part of Dogpatch, but like many planned projects of the park, it would never happen. In 1981, Dogpatch sold the caves and they continued to be managed by Bruce Raney, son of Albert Raney Jr. During this time, the Old Man Moses Cave project was completed. It has since been renamed Crystal Dome and opened to the public. Omni Projects bought the two caves in 1984 and hired Burt Allen to manage the property. In 1988, Steve Rush purchased the property and it was managed by Jennifer Updegraff, Steven Rush and Marcia Johnson. Mystic Caverns, Inc bought the property in 1997 and owns it currently. Present day Today Mystic Caverns and Crystal Dome are managed by Steve Rush, and guided tours, which include both caves, are conducted every 35 to 45 minutes and last about an hour and twenty minutes. In late 2008, Rush put the caverns up for auction on eBay. The minimum bid was first set at $1.2 million, but later reduced to $899,900. Rush said he is selling the attraction because he has \\"tired of trying to entertain people\\" in his role as tour guide. Once a buyer is found for the caverns, Rush plans to become involved in Christian ministries. Mystic Caverns averages about 15,000 visitors each year, Rush told an Associated Press reporter.

Biography  He was born at Granada on 6 July 1814, the son of Colonel Pav√≠a, and after a few years at the Jesuit school in Valencia he entered the Royal Artillery Academy at Segovia. In 1833 he became a lieutenant in the guards of Queen Isabella II, and during the Carlist War from 1833 to 1840 he became general of division in the latter year at the early age of twenty-six. The Moderate party made him war minister in 1847 and sent him to Catalonia, where his efforts to put down a Carlist rising were not attended with success. He had been made a senator in 1845, and marquis in 1848. He was sent out to Manila in 1852 as governor-general of the Philippine Islands. In April 1854 he crushed with much sternness a formidable insurrection and carried out many useful reforms. On his return to Spain he married the Countess of Santa Isabel, and commanded the reserves in the Peninsula during the war with Morocco. He refused the war portfolio twice offered him by Marshals O'Donnell and Narvaez and in 1864 was briefly president of government (prime minister) at the head of a cabinet of conservative-liberal Moderates; his government lasted but a few days. He volunteered to crush the insurrection in Madrid on 22 June 1866, and when the revolution broke out in September 1868 accepted the command of Queen Isabella's troops. He was defeated by Marshal Serrano at the bridge of Alcolea on 28 September 1868, and was so badly wounded in the face that he was disfigured for life. He kept apart during the revolution of 1868, but instead was instrumental in installing the conservative military dictatorship of 1873 that ended the First Republic. It was Pav√≠a who, after 3 January 1874, summoned Marshal Serrano back from France as dictator to the military republic. After the coup of December 1874 restored the liberal monarchy, Pav√≠a went to meet King Alfonso XII of Spain when he landed at Valencia in January 1875. The Restoration made the Marquis de Novaliches a senator, and the new king gave him the Golden Fleece. He died in Madrid on 22 October 1896.

It is a vigorous, spreading, evergreen heather reaching tall and wide, with pink flowers borne in racemes long in summer and autumn. The Latin specific epithet vagans literally means \\"wandering\\"; in this context it means \\"widely distributed\\". Description Cornish heath is an evergreen subshrub, growing to a height of . The small linear leaves with pale undersides and down-rolled margins grow in whorls of four or five on the wiry stems. The inflorescence is a fat, leafy spike with a few long-stalked, globular flowers; these are pink or lilac and have brown stamens that protrude from the open mouths. The flowering period is from July to September. Cornish population In Great Britain it is only found on the Lizard peninsula in southern Cornwall, where the unusual geology gives rise to the acid soils that it favours. It was voted the County flower of Cornwall in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.Plantlife website County Flowers page It is often considered the Cornish floral emblem.James Minahan, The complete guide to national symbols and emblems , Volume 1, 2009 According to one story this is because when Joseph of Arimathea first arrived in Cornwall looking for tin he had nowhere to stay, so he spent his first night on a bed of Cornish heather. In thankfulness, he blessed the plant and it has been a blessed plant ever since. Cultivation Like almost all plants in the heath family (Ericaceae), E. vagans requires an acidic or, at the very least, neutral soil to thrive. In areas with alkaline (basic) soil, this can be achieved by planting E. vagans in containers with ericaceous compost. Numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of flower colours in white, pink, mauve and purple.

The plant provides a great deal of nectar for pollinators. It was rated in the top 5 for most nectar production (nectar per unit cover per year) in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative. Description It is a low, spreading shrub growing to tall, with fine needle-like leaves long arranged in whorls of three. The flowers are bell-shaped, purple (rarely white), long, produced in mid- to late summer. The flowers are dry, similar in texture to the strawflower. The Latin specific epithet cinerea means \\"ash coloured\\". Distribution Erica cinerea is native to the west of Europe, where it is most abundant in Britain and Ireland, France, northern Spain and southern Norway. It also occurs in the Faroe Islands, Belgium, Germany, north-western Italy, and the Netherlands. It mostly occurs on moors and heathland with relatively dry, acidic, nutrient poor soils. It occurs in coastal dune heath and dune slack and occasionally in woodland. It is described as \\"of least concern\\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Uses Bell heather is a source of heather honey. It is grown as an ornamental plant, cultivated in a wider range of colors. It is drought-tolerant and grows well in full sun with well-drained soil. Like most heathers, it is a calcifuge and dislikes alkaline soils (e.g. calcareous) which cause the symptoms of iron deficiency. Like other cultivated heathers, it is often seen as groundcover among plantings of dwarf conifers. These cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: * 'C.D.

Band members are American Jimmy Helms (who also had a successful solo career and sang radio jingles for Radio Hallam and Hereward Radio in the UK); Jimmy Chambers (born 29 January 1946), from Trinidad, and Charles Pierre. Former members include multi-instrumentalist William Henshall (credited as Willy M); George Chandler (formerly a founding member and frontman of Olympic Runners); Marc Goldschmitz (subsequently a member of the band Leash) and Myles Kayne. History Londonbeat's career started in the Netherlands where \\"There's a Beat Going On\\" reached the top 10, and then \\"9 A.M (The Comfort Zone)\\" which subsequently became a modest success in the United Kingdom. They are best known for their song \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\", which hit Number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in 1991, and for their close harmonies. Their follow-up single, \\"A Better Love\\", became a Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 hit, and they returned to Number 1 on the dance chart with \\"Come Back\\" (Hot 100 number 62). Demos A demo of \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" surfaced on audio cassettes and circulated amongst record companies around the time Londonbeat released their d√©but in 1988. \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" was originally intended for release on Speak. However, record labels advised the band to hold off releasing the song on their debut LP so that the band could, as labels said, \\"...find its footing; develop an audience\\". The demo recording, originally completed in late 1987, is currently circulating on the Internet, and originally brought to public attention in a link on a German message board in 2006. German magazines, however, reported on the song just as Speak was being released in 1988. Comeback In 1995, Londonbeat entered the UK heats of the Eurovision Song Contest with \\"I'm Just Your Puppet on a ... (String)\\". However, they were not selected to enter the main contest (losing out to rap group Love City Groove) and the single stalled at Number 55 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2003, Londonbeat re-grouped with a new lineup and signed to German record label Coconut. An album called Back in the Hi-Life featured re- recordings of \\"A Better Love\\" and \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" among the new tracks. Marc Goldschmitz left the band in 2004. Currently living in Berlin, he now plays guitar in the band Leash. In 2011, Londonbeat were featured on two tracks on The Crossing (Expansion Records) by Brazilian pianist Eumir Deodato, the title track (with guest percussionist Paco Sery) and \\"No Getting Over You\\". In 2019, Londonbeat collaborated with German DJ Klaas, who remixed the number one hit \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\". The remix reached the top 10 on the Billboard Dance chart. Other information Chambers and Chandler were backing vocalists for Paul Young's 1985 album The Secret Of Association. Jimmy Helms, George Chandler & Jimmy Chambers were also backing vocals on the Deacon Blue single \\"When Will You Make My Telephone Ring\\" and Fine Young Cannibals album The Raw and the Cooked on three songs: \\"Good Thing\\", \\"Tell Me What\\" and \\"It's OK (It's Alright)\\".

It lies along the B3306 road which connects St Ives to the A30 road. It is situated 7 miles from Land's End and 7 miles from Penzance. It is in the civil parish of St Just. Trewellard lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. History and geography The village is in an area of outstanding natural beauty and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the ancient tin workings and the penultimate working tin mine in Cornwall, Geevor, that closed finally in 1990. Geevor is now a museum and forms part of the World Heritage Site of Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape. Down the lane from Trewellard is Levant Tin Mine which was the site of a terrible accident in 1919 where 31 men were killed. It has been long since closed and is owned by the National Trust which operates it as a museum. Trewellard in recent times The village has undergone some development in the last 20 years much of which is of late 20th century style and as such differs from the early granite dwellings in the village. In 2004 Penwith District Council designated the centre of the village as a Conservation area. This means that planning permission can be more difficult to obtain and has increased the value of land within the village. The Methodist Chapel finally closed in 2005 due to declining attendance and an ageing congregation. House prices are now higher than the national average (as at 2006). It currently boasts two restaurants (one a Meadery), a pub and a garage. There is also a small rural industrial estate.

The median cricothyroid ligament is a flat band of white connective tissue that connects the front parts of the contiguous margins of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. It is a thick and strong ligament, narrow above and broad below. Each lateral ligament is known as the conus elasticus. The lateral cricothyroid ligament is overlapped on either side by laryngeal muscles. The conus elasticus (which means elastic cone in Latin) is the lateral portion of the cricothyroid ligament. The lateral portions are thinner and lie close under the mucous membrane of the larynx; they extend from the upper border of the cricoid cartilage to the lower margin of the vocal ligaments, with which they are continuous. The vocal ligaments may therefore be regarded as the free borders of each conus elasticus, and extend from the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages to the angle of the thyroid cartilage about midway between its upper and lower borders.

Background He was born James McLaren Ross in South Norwood, London, in 1912, the youngest of three children. His middle name, 'McLaren', was a tribute to the family's landlady Mrs McLaren, who had helped his mother during his birth.Selected Letters, Julian Maclaren-Ross, 2004, p. ix His mother, Gertrude, was once described as being from an Anglo-Indian family of English blood, was described as 'a magnificent Indian lady and the obvious source of his male beauty'. His father, John Lambden Ross, came from a prosperous part Scottish, part Cuban family which owned a shipping company called the Thistle Line. Although this family money enabled John Lambden Ross to survive without working, it never afforded his family a high standard of living. Together with their two children, they lived in a series of rented houses and flats in South London, Bognor Regis, the Southbourne district of Bournemouth.http://www.julianmaclaren-ross.co.uk/chronology.html Their time in Bournemouth is described in Maclaren-Ross's lyrical and evocative memoir, The Weeping and the Laughter (1953). Lured by the cheaper cost of living, the family moved to the South of France in August 1921. There, Maclaren-Ross received his only formal education. At the age of twenty-one, he drifted back to England, determined to make a career as a writer. With the help of a modest allowance from his grandfather, he initially lived in London, where he first sampled the bohemian world of Soho and Fitzrovia. In 1936 he married a young actress and moved down to rented accommodation in Bognor Regis, but the marriage didn't last long. When his allowance was cut off in 1938, he earned a living as a door-to-door vacuum-cleaner salesman. He continued to write in his spare-time. At that time he concentrated on writing radio plays, one of which was broadcast by the BBC. His breakthrough came in 1940 when Horizon agreed to publish his short story, ‚ÄúA Bit of a Smash in Madras.‚Äù Shortly after its publication, he was conscripted into the army. While stationed in a series of English coastal garrisons, he produced a string of satirical short stories about the army. These appear in Horizon, Penguin New Writing, English Story and the other leading literary magazines of the period, earning him a reputation as one of the rising stars of English writing. During January 1943, he deserted from the army. On being gaoled, he suffered a breakdown. He was then sent to a military psychiatric hospital in the Northfield district of Birmingham. After a brief period of imprisonment, he settled in London where he soon found a job as a scriptwriter on government propaganda documentaries, working alongside the poet Dylan Thomas. Meanwhile, in July 1944 Jonathan Cape published his first book‚Äîa collection of short stories entitled The Stuff To Give The Troops. These stories prompted the novelist Evelyn Waugh to declare, ‚ÄúMr Maclaren-Ross's work‚Ä¶ shows accomplishment of a rare kind.‚ÄùLetter from Evelyn Waugh to the Royal Literary Fund, 4 July 1950. Through the post-war 1940s, by which time he had become a ubiquitous and flamboyant presence in the pubs of Fitzrovia and Soho, he established himself as a respected literary critic, writing for The Times Literary Supplement. He also published two more short story collections, not to mention the novel, Of Love and Hunger (1947), which Anthony Powell rated as highly as the work of Patrick Hamilton and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Powell was not alone in admiring Maclaren-Ross's fiction. Other prominent fans included Graham Greene, Elizabeth Bowen, John Lehmann, V.S Pritchett, Olivia Manning, and John Betjeman, the latter of whom described him as 'one the most gifted writers of his generation.‚Äù Maclaren-Ross's career was, however, undermined by his boozy, amphetamine-fuelled, spendthrift way of life. In search of rapid financial rewards, he devoted more and more time to journalism, screenwriting, and French-into-English translation work. The mid-1950s represented the low point of his life. Obsessed by George Orwell's glamorous widow, Sonia, he ended up homeless, sleeping in the waiting-room at Euston Station, on underground trains, and on friends' settees. He also had a brief spell in prison for non-payment of debts. Yet his resilience and determination enabled him to rebuild his life over the next few years. In 1958 he married Diana Bromley, Leonard Woolf's rackety bohemian niece. She gave birth to his only child, Alex. Maclaren-Ross had by then reinvented himself as a writer of popular BBC radio drama, notably the thriller series, Until the Day She Dies, which was broadcast on the Light Programme. He also began writing a series of reminiscences for the London Magazine. These were conceived as part of what he called his Memoirs of the Forties. Only part of this had been completed when he suffered a fatal heart attack in November 1964, his demise probably hastened by years of alcoholism, amphetamine-taking, and stress. In his Times obituary on 6 November 1964 the paper said MacLaren- Ross 'was a dedicated and highly professional writer who never quite found the right vein for his talents.' It added that his short stories: > 'took him into the wartime literary world, where he became a conspicuous > figure in Soho and Fitzrovia, blossoming out after his demobilization as a > tall, slightly theatrical-looking gentleman with a silver-knobbed stick. > This appearance, and the formal manners that went with it, were somewhat > misleading. His stories of Soho, though aimed at a less important target > than their predecessors, were still ironic, often tightly compressed and > usually very funny. At the same time he was starting to work as a script- > writer in films, a subject which always passionately interested him. Then he > turned his attention further back: first to his unhappy prewar period as a > salesman, which became the subject of his one really serious novel Of Love > and Hunger (1947) then to his childhood as son of a none too prosperous > Scottish father, dividing his retirement between France and a melancholy- > refined English seaside. The Weeping and the Laughter, the first volume of > this autobiography, appeared in 1953 and only took him up to the age of 11; > unfortunately it was never followed by others, and from then on he was > driven to do a great deal too much occasional work to fulfil his very real > potentialities. Unfortunately for him perhaps, he was an admirable > contributor of occasional articles and parodies to Punch and a valued > reviewer for The Times Literary Supplement, The Sunday Times, and, more > recently, The London Magazine. He also did occasional film work and at least > two thriller-serials for the Light Programme of the B.B.C. But in spite of > his interest in, and encyclopaedic knowledge of, the thriller form in both > novel and film his own incursions into the medium were never really > successful, either in the artistic or in the commercial sense.

Ironic, self-controlled, slightly stilted, yet > giving nothing away, they were very like the man himself.'Times. November 6 > 1964 In the wake of Maclaren-Ross's death, his uncompleted Memoirs of the Forties was published by Alan Ross under the London Magazine Editions banner. The book was a critical and commercial success. The reviewer for The Times stated, 'He wrote with economy and a formal elegance that marvellously suited his detached attitude to whatever in his surroundings seemed odd, ridiculous or wild; down it all went in curt graphic dialogue and deadpan description. There is nothing else that so conveys the atmosphere of bohemian and fringe-literary London under the impact of war and its immediate hangover. The book is comic, nostalgic and at times even moving, all without the least sense of strain.'The Times, 23 September 1965 Over subsequent years he went on to enjoy a strange, posthumous career as the model for characters in other people's books. The best-known of these are the bohemian novelist X. Trapnel in Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time and as Prince Yakimov in Olivia Manning's The Balkan Trilogy. Prompted by the publication of Fear and Loathing in Fitzrovia, Paul Willetts's much-praised biography, all of his finest work came back into print, attracting praise from the likes of D.J. Taylor, Lucian Freud, Philip French, Virginia Ironside, Sarah Waters, and Harold Pinter, who dramatised a couple of his short stories for BBC radio. ‚ÄúIt was a great treat to discover the writing of Julian Maclaren-Ross. Witty, smart, eccentric‚Äîhe never ceases to entertain,‚Äù wrote Sarah Waters.Dustjacket quote on Julian Maclaren-Ross's Selected Letters (Black Spring Press, 2008) With comparable enthusiasm, the critic and novelist, D.J. Taylor hailed Maclaren-Ross as ‚Äúone of the great unsung heroes of the literary 1940s and at his best a figure to rank with Orwell, Connolly and Waugh.‚ÄùDustjacket quote from Julian Maclaren-Ross: Collected Memoirs (Black Spring Press, 2004) > Works * The Stuff to Give the Troops, Jonathan Cape (1944) * Better than > a Kick in the Pants, Lawson & Dunn, jointly with Hyperion Press (1945) * > Bitten by the Tarantula, Allan Wingate (1946), * The Nine Men of Soho, Allan > Wingate (1946) * Of Love and Hunger, Allan Wingate (1947) * The Weeping and > the Laughter, Rupert Hart-Davis (1953) * The Funny Bone, Elek Books (1956) * > Until the Day She Dies, Hamish Hamilton (1960) * The Doomsday Book, Hamish > Hamilton (1961) * My Name is Love, Times Press (1964) * Memoirs of the > Forties, Alan Ross (1965) * Julian Maclaren-Ross: Collected Memoirs, Black > Spring Press (2004) * Julian Maclaren-Ross: Selected Stories, Dewi Lewis > (2004) * Bitten by the Tarantula and other writing, Black Spring Press > (2005) * Selected Letters, Black Spring Press (2008) Further reading * > Closing Times, Dan Davin (1975) * Dead as Doornails, Anthony Cronin (1976) * > Fear and Loathing in Fitzrovia, Paul Willetts, (Dewi Lewis Publishing, 2003, > revised 2005) * Waterstone's Guide to London Writing (1999) * London's > Bohemia, Michael Bakewell (1999) References External links * Morning > Star profile * Guardian review of biography * Guardian review of short story > collections * Julian Maclaren-Ross website including extracts and interviews > *\\"An unpublished story by Julian Maclaren-Ross\\": an unpublished story by > Julian Maclaren-Ross from TLS, 25 June 2008. * BBC Radio 4 programme about > Maclaren-Ross Category:1912 births Category:1964 deaths Category:English > people of Scottish descent Category:People from South Norwood Category:20th- > century English novelists ","title":"Julian MacLaren-Ross"},{"id":"2180625","text":"Berle is a village on the west coast of Norway. It is located on the eastern coast of Bremangerlandet island in the municipality of Bremanger in Vestland county. The village lies along the Berlepollen fjord, a small inlet off the Fr√∏ysj√∏en strait which separates it from the mainland. The village of Berle lies about west of the Hornelen cliff and about a drive west from the village of Bremanger. Berle Church is located in the village, serving the people in this part of the municipality. The population (2001) of the village is 135. Name The name of the village comes from the name of the small river nearby (). The small Berlepollen fjord nearby is similarly named. The name Ber√∞la comes from the Old Norse word bar√∞, meaning \\"edge\\", possibly since it is on the edge of the island. The village's name is mentioned as early as in the Egils saga. History The history of Berle goes back to the 8th century. The best known Viking who lived there at the time was Berle K√•re. Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic historian, writes about Berle K√•re, and his sons were a central subject in the histories of Harald Fairhair.

Laid down in 1941, launched in 1942 and commissioned in 1943 it was decommissioned in 1986 and finally sold for scrap. Ajax received four battle stars for Korean War service and five campaign stars for service in Vietnam. 1941‚Äì1945 Ajax was laid down on 7 May 1941 at Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, San Pedro, California, launched on 22 August 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Isaac C. Johnson commissioned on 30 October 1943, Comdr. John L. Brown in command. The repair ship departed San Pedro on 9 December, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 16 December, and began preparing small craft to be used as control vessels in the Marshall Islands campaign by installing radar, sound detection equipment, and antiaircraft guns. The ship was part of the clean up of the Pearl Harbor attack. On 8 January 1944, an oil fire in her blacksmith shop threatened the entire ship, but was extinguished. Nevertheless, Ajax spent part of January repairing her own damage. On 25 January, Ajax was ordered to proceed in company with to the Ellice Islands; but, two days after reaching Funafuti, she moved to Makin Atoll, Gilbert Islands, to work on the ships that would occupy Majuro in the Marshall Islands. Upon completing that mission, the ship returned to Funafuti on 26 February, only to sail three days later for Majuro. While she was serving there, Service Squadron (ServRon) 4 was absorbed by ServRon 10. There, she and repaired combatant ships through the Hollandia strikes and during preparations for the Marianas campaign. On 13 June, she sailed for Eniwetok to help set up an advance repair base where she labored through August, at one time working extensive jobs on 19 cruisers and nine battleships. Late in August, bacillary dysentery broke out among the crew and soon reached epidemic proportions. The ship was quarantined on 1 September and detached on 9 September to proceed to Kwajalein to combat the epidemic. Quarantine ended on 10 October, and Ajax steamed to Ulithi to resume repair work and to handle her first major battle damage job. Severely damaged during a torpedo attack off Formosa, received sufficient temporary repairs alongside Ajax to enable the cruiser to continue on to Manus. The repair ship continued her work at Ulithi in support of operations in the Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. On 25 May 1945, Ajax headed for San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, to help prepare for the final assault on Japan, spending July repairing typhoon- battered . The job consisted of rebuilding the forward section of her flight deck and required assistance from , , and . Upon learning of Japan's capitulation on 15 August, Ajax began readying amphibious and transport ships to carry occupation forces to the Japanese home islands. On 20 September, she sailed for Guiuan, Samar; embarked troops for passage to Okinawa; and once there, repaired other typhoon-damaged ships. Ironically, while she was carrying out this task, typhoons forced her to go to sea herself on 28 September and on 7 October. But for these two incidents, her work at Okinawa was uninterrupted until 28 November, when she sailed for the United States with 800 passengers. She arrived at San Diego on 18 December and, three days later, entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for a six-week overhaul. 1946‚Äì1953 The yard work ended on 23 February 1946, and Ajax sailed via Pearl Harbor for the Bikini Atoll to participate in the atomic bomb tests to be held there in July. The first bomb was dropped 8 miles away from the ship, the second only 6 miles away. The crew men were instructed to stand on the deck. It was reported that each man saw the skeleton of the man in front of him. Following the tests, she returned to San Diego on 8 October. For the next few years, she tended ships primarily at San Diego. The repair ship got underway on 2 April 1951 for the first of many postwar cruises to Japan and arrived at Yokosuka on the 18th. She headed for Sasebo on 1 May and spent the rest of the year and early 1952 engaged in repair services in those two ports. Ajax returned to San Diego on 26 April and devoted the next four and one-half months to operations in various shipyards and ports along the coast of California. She made five more cruises to Japan before 1960, each time operating out of Sasebo and Yokosuka and in every instance returning to San Diego. While in Sasebo on November 30, 1952 the ship that the Ajax was moored next to, the USS Ashtabula ( AO -51) exploded! The resulting casualties for the Ajax were two dead and three wounded.[1] On her 1953-1954 cruise to the Far East, Ajax, in addition to her operations out of Sasebo and Yokosuka, participated in the two-month operation \\"Passage to Freedom\\", providing support for a group of U.S. Navy ships sent to carry refugees from the Hanoi/Haiphong area of Communist North Vietnam, down to Saigon. During this operation Ajax was stationed at Touraine Indochina, a French port that later became DaNang, South Vietnam. She returned to San Diego on 21 November 1954, along with several attack transports.Associated Press, ‚ÄúParade of Navy Ships to Bring Thousands Home From Pacific,‚Äù San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 19 November 1954, Volume LXI, Number 69, page 4. 1960‚Äì1964 Ajax returned from the United States to Japan in February 1960 and in June received orders changing her home port from San Diego to Sasebo. She then became the permanent flagship of ServRon 3 in the Far East. She moved to Yokosuka in August to begin her first yard overhaul in the Orient. Among her alterations was the installation of flag office spaces for ServRon 3 staff. Following refresher training, underway replenishment, and towing exercises with , Ajax returned to Sasebo on 17 December. Early in 1961, she became an ambassador of goodwill on a cruise in which she entertained local dignitaries as well as the local populace during visits to Kure, Beppu, Kagoshima, Iwakuni, and Kobe, Japan; Hong Kong; Keelung and Kaoshiung, Taiwan; Subic Bay; and Buckner Bay, Okinawa. A scheduled two-day visit to the last port became a three-week stay in March and April when Ajax remained there as backup repair ship in the event that President John F. Kennedy's strong diplomatic resistance to communist aggression in Laos would involve the American Navy in hostilities. When , the first nuclear submarine to put into a Japanese port, arrived at Sasebo on 12 November 1964, Ajax served as a press platform for radio and television reporters who came to report the event. 1968‚Äì1976 On 10 January 1968, Ajax sailed for Subic Bay where she remained until mid-March, before returning to her home port. On 3 June, the repair ship headed for South Vietnam and arrived at Vung Tau on 9 June. Although that port was a rest and recreation center for the allied forces, Ajax worked without break for 13 days making badly needed repairs and providing services to ships and small craft operating in the Mekong Delta, as well as to various Army and Air Force equipment ashore. The ship got underway for Subic Bay on 22 June, arrived on 25 June, and undertook a repair job of considerable significance‚Äîthe regunning of 4 √ó mounts on . The repair ship's technicians worked around the clock for seven days to complete the job and return Boston to her ready status. After her arrival in Sasebo on 23 July, Ajax provided routine repairs and service support for ships there and in Yokosuka for the remainder of the year and the beginning of 1969. Ajax continued her usual routine of servicing ships in Sasebo, Yokosuka, and Subic Bay during 1969, including a two-week stay in Vung Tau from 27 September to 10 October. As 1970 began, she received word that her home port would revert to San Diego effective 1 June. Prior to that date, Ajax continued servicing Vung Tau from 18 April to 11 May in support of the Cambodian Campaign. relieved Ajax as flagship on 10 July; and, on the 15th, the latter headed for San Diego where she arrived on 6 August. On 14 June 1971, following a year's service on the California coast, the ship once again steamed toward Japan and arrived in Sasebo on 5 July. Commander, Service Group (ComServGru) 3, embarked; and Ajax commenced business as usual. The ship spent September in Vung Tau, but her month of hard work there was followed by five days of rest and relaxation in Hong Kong before she returned to Sasebo on 1 October. However, the vessel soon again proceeded to Vung Tau and worked diligently for the first three weeks in November. Next came a three-day rest in Keelung and Taipei, Taiwan, before a run back to Sasebo to prepare for the voyage home. On 27 January 1972, ComServGru 3 shifted his flag to Hector; and Ajax steamed via Pearl Harbor to San Diego where she arrived on 16 February and served for the remainder of the year. Ajax again got underway westward on 16 January 1973 and stopped at Pearl Harbor before arriving in Sasebo on 6 February to relieve Jason as flagship. The ship made two rest and relaxation cruises, one in April to Keelung and the other in July to Hong Kong. Typhoon Dot complicated the second cruise by closing Hong Kong harbor and causing Ajax to circle in rough waters for two extra days before pulling into port. Her return to Sasebo on 25 July was uneventful; and, after being relieved by Hector on 7 August, the ship headed home, arrived at San Diego on 29 August, and remained in California for the rest of the year and the first six months of 1974. On 6 July of that year, she got underway in company with and steamed for Yokosuka which she reached on 27 July. She operated there until 8 November when she headed for Subic Bay to provide fleet repair services. She labored in the Philippines for a month before proceeding to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where she ended the year. Ajax returned to San Diego on 15 February 1975. On 5 October, she got underway for a two-month visit to Pearl Harbor to provide repair support in the middle Pacific. She departed Hawaii on 8 December and arrived in her home port on the 15th in time for a holiday in a leave and upkeep period. Ajax remained in or near San Diego for the entire year 1976. 1977‚Äì1986 During the first half of 1977, Ajax made ready for another deployment. The ship departed San Diego with on 24 August and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 August. The following morning, Ajax got underway for Japan and six months in Yokosuka. A series of labor strikes by Japanese employees gave the repair ship's crew members the opportunity to prove their expertise and capabilities. Besides carrying out their normal duties, they helped run the base utilities and acted as firemen, bus drivers, and skilled practitioners of many other occupations to aid the naval activity. She visited Taipei, Taiwan, in December and spent four days in January 1978 in Pusan, Korea. On 5 February, she headed via Pearl Harbor for San Diego, where she arrived on 24 February. Except for two days of sea trials in April, Ajax remained at San Diego until mid-1980. During this period she received an overhaul there by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company which lasted from 21 September 1978 to 21 July 1979. On 20 May, she sailed for the Orient and reached Subic Bay on 17 June. Three days later, the ship got underway and steamed via Sri Lanka to Diego Garcia where she arrived and relieved on 6 July. During her busy three months in the Indian Ocean servicing 31 ships, Ajax made a brief visit to Port Louis, Mauritius, for recreation. On 12 October, after being relieved by , Ajax sailed eastward; stopped in Bunbury and Sydney, Australia; Pearl Harbor; and finally reached San Diego on 20 November. With the exception of two three-day visits to San Francisco and two days of training in the local operating area, Ajax remained in San Diego throughout 1981. One notable occurrence during the year was the reporting on board for duty of the ship's first 30 enlisted women. While the women became accustomed to shipboard routine, Ajax underwent inspections and training. On 16 October, the ship reached another milestone in the Women at Sea program when Ens. Dale Norris became the first woman officer on board Ajax to become surface warfare qualified. On 22 January 1982, Ajax got underway for training and a brief port visit to Mazatlan, Mexico, and arrived back home on the last day of the month. Pre-overseas movement preparations throughout the next few months ensured that the repair ship was ready for her 2 April departure for the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. After a four-day stopover in Pearl Harbor, the ship headed for Subic Bay, where she arrived on 1 May and spent three weeks providing fleet repair services before continuing on to Diego Garcia where she arrived on 1 June. During that deployment, Ajax visited Berbera in Somalia, Singapore, and Pattaya in Thailand, before she returned‚Äîvia Pearl Harbor‚Äîto San Diego. The repair ship entered San Diego on 21 October and commenced post-deployment standdown. Her leave and upkeep period came to an end in November, and Ajax set about her repair work once again. Over the next seven months, the ship provided repair services for units of the Pacific Fleet at San Diego, served as a training facility for naval reserve detachments undergoing their annual two weeks of active duty, and made preparations for a regular overhaul. She also put to sea infrequently for trials and, on one occasion in May and June 1983, to carry her repair services to Bremerton, Wash. Ajax returned to San Diego from that mission on 10 June 1983 and, the next day, began a month of final preparations for overhaul. On 11 July, her crew moved to living spaces on board a non-self-propelled barracks ship, and the overhaul began in earnest. Receiving repair services, rather than extending them to others, occupied her time for the rest of 1983 and during the first two months of 1984. On 1 and 2 March, she put to sea to conduct post-overhaul trials and, on the 3d, resumed repair services to other units of the Pacific Fleet. During the last week in March, she was frequently at sea in the local operating area carrying out independent ship's exercises. From the beginning of April to late June, Ajax performed repair missions at San Diego. On 27 June, the repair ship stood out of San Diego and, after a day of independent ship's exercises in the local operating area, shaped a course for the Naval Air Station, Alameda, where she moored on 29 June. Ajax carried out repair assignments at Alameda until the third week in September. On 16 September, she got underway to conduct exercises and then head back to San Diego. The repair ship tied up at pierside at the Naval Station, San Diego, on 19 September. Except for two periods at sea in October for refresher training, Ajax spent the rest of 1984 in port repairing ships of the Pacific Fleet. She continued so engaged into January 1985, though she interrupted those efforts from the 19th to the 21st to carry out sea trials in the southern California operating area. The first three weeks of February brought more repair work; however, on the 22nd, she put to sea again bound for Long Beach. Ajax reached her destination on 27 February and set about her work almost immediately. She spent the next five months‚Äîsave for five days underway locally in May‚Äîperforming repairs at Long Beach. On 31 July, the repair ship embarked upon the final overseas assignment of her Navy career. Her last deployment afforded Ajax a real opportunity to carry out the function for which she had been designed and built. Continually moving, she performed repairs at widely separated locations. Steaming by way of Hawaii and Guam, she arrived in the Philippines at Subic Bay on 31 August. From Subic Bay, she voyaged to Singapore where she stopped between 24 September and 3 October. Leaving Singapore, Ajax headed through the Malacca Strait into the Indian Ocean. She arrived at isolated Diego Garcia Island on 11 October but resumed her voyage again on the 13th. The repair ship dropped anchor at Al Masirah, an island in the Arabian Sea just off the east coast of Oman, on the 19th and carried out repair work there until the beginning of November. On the 2d, she headed back to Diego Garcia where she arrived on the 9th. Her crew performed repairs on and before Ajax put to sea to return to Al Masirah. After conducting availabilities for ships of the Middle East Force at Al Masirah from 22 November to 5 December, she put to sea to avoid a large dust storm. While still underway, she laid in a course for Singapore on 7 December. The ship reached her destination on 20 December. Following repairs on , Ajax set sail once again on 31 December bound for Diego Garcia Island. She arrived at Diego Garcia on 7 January 1986 and provided repair services there for a fortnight. On 22 January, the ship left Diego Garcia in her wake and set course for Pattaya, Thailand, where she spent most of the first week in February. On 12 February, Ajax stood into Subic Bay where she was relieved by Hector. USS Ajax at Bremerton in 1989. The repair ship embarked upon the long voyage across the Pacific Ocean on 21 February. She stopped at Pearl Harbor between 8 and 10 March and arrived back in San Diego on the 18th. Following the usual leave and upkeep period, Ajax resumed her repair services. That activity lasted until the second week in September when she began preparations to go out of service. Ajax was decommissioned at San Diego on 31 December 1986. Struck from the Navy list on 16 May 1989, Ajax was finally sold for scrapping by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service on 23 May 1997.

It was named for Captain James Gascoigne of the sloop-of-war, HMS Hawk, which led some of the first British settlers to the coast of Georgia. Timber harvested from 2,000 Southern live oak trees from Gascoigne Bluff was used to build the USS Constitution and the five other original US Navy frigates, under the Naval Act of 1794. The Constitution is known as \\"Old Ironsides\\" for the way the cannonballs bounced off the hard oak planking. This area was one of several St. Simons Island plantations owned by John Couper (father of James Hamilton Couper, see below) who lived at Cannon Point, St. Simons Island, and who donated his library of 20,000 volumes to the Library of Congress.

Among the better examples of surviving slave cabins in the South, they are composed of tabby, a cement consisting of lime, water, and crushed oyster shells. The cabins have built-in windows and a central chimney. James Hamilton Couper, namesake of the owner and manager of the plantation, was an architect and a builder. He designed and built the cabins to house the slaves who served in the plantation's main house. Utilizing a duplex plan to house more than one family, the cabins were originally part of a planned community of slave dwellings. The Hamilton Plantation and Gasciogne Bluff were sold after the Civil War to Anson Dodge and the Georgia Land and Lumber Company of New York in 1874 to erect lumber mills.[http://www.glynncounty.com/History_and_Lore/Ed_Green/old_mill_days.shtml St. Simons History VI.

It is dedicated to Our Lady of Kazan, one of the most venerated icons in Russia. Background Construction of the cathedral started in 1801 and continued for ten years under the supervision of Alexander Sergeyevich Stroganov. Upon its completion in 1811, the new temple replaced the Church of Nativity of the Theotokos, which was disassembled when the Kazan Cathedral was consecrated. The architect Andrey Voronikhin modelled the building on St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Some art historians assert that Emperor Paul (reigned 1796-1801) intended to build a similar church on the other side of Nevsky Prospect that would mirror the Kazan Cathedral, but such plans failed to materialize. Although the Russian Orthodox Church strongly disapproved of the plans to create a replica of a Catholic basilica in Russia's then capital, several courtiers supported Voronikhin's Empire Style design. After Napoleon invaded Russia (1812) and the commander-in-chief General Mikhail Kutuzov asked Our Lady of Kazan for help, the church's purpose altered. The Patriotic War over, Russians saw the cathedral primarily as a memorial to their victory over Napoleon. Kutuzov himself was interred in the cathedral in 1813; and Alexander Pushkin wrote celebrated lines meditating over his sepulchre. In 1815 keys to seventeen cities and eight fortresses were brought by the victorious Russian army from Europe and placed in the cathedral's sacristy. In 1837, Boris Orlovsky designed two bronze statues of Kutuzov and of Barclay de Tolly which stand in front of the cathedral. 1896 Photochrom print In 1876 the Kazan demonstration, the first political demonstration in Russia, took place in front of the church. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the authorities closed the cathedral (January 1932). In November 1932 it reopened as the pro-Marxist \\"Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism\\".For a perspicacious account of the \\"Museum\\" written a few years before the fall of Soviet communism, see https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D9163BF930A1575BC0A961948260 (retrieved 2008 January 28) or, as one contemporary writer put it more baldly, \\"Leningrad's largest antireligious museum\\", complete with Spanish Inquisition waxworks . Services resumed in 1992, and four years later the cathedral was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. it functions as the mother cathedral of the metropolis of St. Petersburg. The cathedral's interior, with its numerous columns, echoes the exterior colonnade and is reminiscent of a palatial hall, being 69 metres in length and 62 metres in height. The interior features numerous sculptures and icons created by the best Russian artists of the day. A wrought-iron grille separating the cathedral from a small square behind it is sometimes cited as one of the finest ever constructed. The cathedral's huge bronze doors are one of four copies of the original doors of the Baptistery in Florence, Italy (the other three are at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, United States, at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, United States, and at the Florence Baptistery itself).

Description Instead of pentameter, the lines were written in iambic tetrameter.

Example The first fourteen lines of Hudibras illustrate the verse form: :When civil dudgeon first grew high, :And men fell out they knew not why; :When hard words, jealousies, and fears, :Set folks together by the ears, :And made them fight, like mad or drunk, :For Dame Religion, as for punk; :Whose honesty they all durst swear for, :Though not a man of them knew wherefore: :When Gospel-Trumpeter, surrounded :With long-ear'd rout, to battle sounded, :And pulpit, drum ecclesiastick, :Was beat with fist, instead of a stick; :Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling, :And out he rode a colonelling. Further description The rhyme of \\"swear for\\" with \\"wherefore\\" and \\"ecclesiastic\\" with \\"(in)stead of a stick\\" are surprising, unnatural, and humorous. Additionally, the rhyme of \\"-don dwelling\\" with \\"a colonelling\\" is strained to the point of breaking, again for humorous effect. Further, the rhyme scheme in a Hudibrastic will imply inappropriate comparisons. For example, the rhyme of \\"drunk\\" and \\"punk\\" (meaning \\"a prostitute\\") implies that the religious ecstasies of the Puritans were the same as that of sexual intercourse and inebriation. The hudibrastic has been traditionally used for satire. Jonathan Swift, for example, wrote nearly all of his poetry in hudibrastics.

It lies on the coast by the Bay of Bengal, 60 kilometres from the capital of the state, Bhubaneswar. It is the site of the 13th-century Sun Temple, also known as the Black Pagoda, built in black granite during the reign of Narasimhadeva-I. The temple is a World Heritage Site. The temple is now mostly in ruins, and a collection of its sculptures is housed in the Sun Temple Museum, which is run by the Archaeological Survey of India. Konark is also home to an annual dance festival called Konark Dance Festival, devoted to classical Indian dance forms, including the traditional classical dance of Odisha, Odissi. In February 2019, the Konark Dance Festival (now called Konark Music and Dance Festival) will be hosting its 33rd edition. The state government is also organising annual Konark Festival and International Sand Art Festival at Chandrabhaga Beach of Konark. On 16 February 1980, Konark lay directly on the path of a total solar eclipse. Etymology The name Kon√¢rka is derived from the Sanskrit word Kona (meaning angle) and word Arka (meaning sun) in reference to the temple which was dedicated to the Sun god Surya.Kon√¢rka is a combination of two words, kona (corner) and arka (Sun).  The Sun Temple Konark Sun Temple The Sun Temple was built in the 13th century and designed as a gigantic chariot of the Sun God, Surya, with twelve pairs of ornamented wheels pulled by seven horses. Some of the wheels are 3 metres wide. Only six of the seven horse still stand today.It is a monumental representation of the chariot of Surya pulled by a team of seven horses (six of which still exist and are placed on either side of the stairway leading to the sanctuary). The temple fell into disuse after an envoy of Jahangir desecrated the temple in the early 17th century.The temple fell into disuse in the early 17th century after it was desecrated by an envoy of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. According to folklore, there was a diamond in the centre of the idol which reflected the sun rays that passed. In 1627, the then Raja of Khurda took the Sun idol from Konark to the Jagannath temple in Puri. The Sun temple belongs to the Kalingan school of Indian temple architecture. The alignment of the Sun Temple is along the east‚Äìwest direction. The inner sanctum or vimana used to be surmounted by a tower or shikara but it was razed in the 19th century. The audience hall or jagamohana still stands and comprises majority of the ruins. The roof of the dance hall or natmandir has fallen off. It stands at the eastern end of the ruins on a raised platform.Further to the east, the natmandir (dance hall), today unroofed, rises on a high platform. History In 1559, Mukunda Gajapati came to throne in Cuttack. He aligned himself as an ally of Akbar and an enemy of the Sultan of Bengal, Sulaiman Khan Karrani. After a few battles, Odisha finally fell. The fall was also aided by the internal turmoil of the state. In 1568, the Konark temple was damaged by the army of Kalapahad, a general of the Sultan. Kalapahad is also said to be responsible for damages to several other temples during the conquest. Demographics As of 2011 India census, Konark had a population of 16,779. Males constitute 8,654 (52%) of the population and females 8,125 (48%).As of 2001 Census Konark has an average literacy rate of 57%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 64%, and female literacy is 49%.

It ceased to be struck after 1956 and was demonetised from 1 January 1961.The Farthing's Last Day The British farthing is a continuation of the English farthing, struck by English monarchs prior to the Act of Union 1707 which unified the crowns of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. Only pattern farthings were struck under Queen Anne as there was a glut of farthings from previous reigns. The coin was struck intermittently under George I and George II, but by the reign of George III, counterfeits were so prevalent the Royal Mint ceased striking copper coinage after 1775. The next farthings were the first struck by steam power, in 1799 by Matthew Boulton at his Soho Mint under licence. Boulton coined more in 1806, and the Royal Mint resumed production in 1821. The farthing was struck fairly regularly under George IV and William IV. By then it carried a scaled-down version of the penny's design, and would continue to mirror the penny and halfpenny until after 1936. Farthings were struck in most years of Queen Victoria's long reign. The coin continued to be issued in most years of the first half of the 20th century, and in 1937 it finally received its own reverse design, a wren. By the time the coin bore the portrait of Elizabeth II from 1953 to 1956, inflation had eroded its value. A fall in commercial demand also contributed to its demise.  Early issues (1714‚Äì1775)  1714 Anne farthing The British farthing is a continuation of the farthing series begun in silver under the English king Henry III in the 13th century and first struck in copper in the early 17th century under James I of England. Britannia first appeared on the coin in 1672, under Charles II. Issuance of farthings had not been necessary during most of the reign of Queen Anne (1701‚Äì1714) due to a surplus of English farthings, which continued in circulation. But beginning in 1713, there was a shortage of copper coin (the halfpenny and farthing). The Royal Mint planned to issue farthings in 1714, but this was thwarted by the death of the Queen that year. The 1714 farthing, weighing 4.8‚Äì5.8 grams and of 21‚Äì22 millimetres diameter, is deemed a pattern. It contained about a farthing's worth of copper, as Sir Isaac Newton was Master of the Mint, and he believed coins should contain their value in metal. Some Anne farthings escaped into circulation, and there was a persistent and incorrect legend that they were of immensely high value. Britannia is said to bear the likeness of Queen Anne, and according to the numismatic writer Kerry Rodgers, \\"it was at this point that the blending of the female personification of Britain with the image of the reigning Queen takes firm hold.\\" Newton had strong views about the quality of the coinage, and the Anne farthing displays advances, such as greater consistency in striking, over that of William III. The need for a copper coinage was no less after the accession of King George I (1714‚Äì1727), but the Anne halfpennies and farthings (made with metal prepared at the Royal Mint) had failed tests for purity, and it was not until 1717 that Newton tried to coin those two denominations again, this time from copper strip purchased from a contractor. The price of metal had risen, so the new farthings were lighter than the Anne coins, at 4.5‚Äì5.3 grams. The farthings struck in 1717 were smaller and thicker than the 1714 coins, with a diameter of 20‚Äì21 millimetres, and they are known as \\"dump\\" farthings. Farthings of 1719‚Äì1724 are slightly larger, at 22‚Äì23 millimetres, but are of the same weight. The coins were in high relief, and the Royal Mint had trouble transferring the design to the blanks, resulting in myriad flaws. The coin features the right-facing head of King George and the inscription GEORGIVS REX on the obverse, and for the reverse a design identical to that of the Anne farthings: Britannia with the inscription BRITANNIA and the date in the exergue below. Farthings were for sale at the Mint's premises at the Tower of London in packets of five and ten shillings; the Treasury refused to allocate funds for provincial distribution. The farthing's designs were by John Croker, possibly assisted by Johann Rudolph Ochs Sr, and were struck in every year from 1717‚Äì1724. The Mint had contracted for strip for seven years; when the contract ended, the coinage stopped. 1719 George I farthing George I died in 1727, the same year as Newton, and the king's son King George II succeeded to the throne, reigning until 1760. Croker engraved the new king's head for the coinage; the Britannia design was not changed. Farthings with Croker's design for George's head were minted in 1730‚Äì1737 and 1739. A bust showing an older king by John Sigismund Tanner was used on the farthing in 1741, 1744, 1746, 1749, 1750, and 1754, though the 1754 coin was probably minted at least until 1763. All George II farthings weighed 4.5‚Äì5.3 grams and had a diameter of 22‚Äì23 millimetres. Both obverses showed left-facing heads of King George and the inscription GEORGIVS II REX, and on the reverse, Britannia with the inscription BRITANNIA and the date in the exergue. The farthing was made in relatively small number compared to the halfpenny (struck every year from 1730‚Äì1754); in no year were even half as many farthings coined, and in most years, far fewer. The 1754 stoppage was due to a glut of coppers, and was done at the urgent request of merchants. Even then, a different problem‚Äîcounterfeiting‚Äîhad emerged. Lightweight counterfeit halfpennies and farthings (the penny was then made of silver) had been seen as early as 1725, and in the following decades, they became a flood. The laws at the time made counterfeiting copper coin merely a misdemeanour, punishable by a fine or a short term in gaol, while counterfeiting of gold and silver was dealt with severely. The counterfeits were especially prevalent in rural areas where regal issues, with no organised plan of distribution, were rarely seen. No farthings were coined after 1754, with the exception of 1754-dated later issues which may have been due to the Royal Mint using up stocks of copper. To make the counterfeiting uneconomical, in 1755 the Mint Board proposed reducing the value of the farthing to pence and the halfpenny to , but the Government refused. The first halfpennies and farthings with the head of George II's grandson and successor, King George III (1760‚Äì1820), were issued in 1771, the year Parliament made it a felony to counterfeit copper coin. This had little effect; large quantities were melted down for lightweight imitations, though the farthing was less counterfeited than the halfpenny. This first series of George III farthings, struck in 1771 and 1773‚Äì1775, had a weight of 4.3‚Äì5.3 grams, with diameter 23‚Äì24 millimetres. The obverse, designed by Richard Yeo or Thomas Pingo depicts a right-facing bust of the king, with the inscription GEORGIVS III REX, while no significant change was made to the reverse. Despite the counterfeiting, the Mint ceased striking coppers in 1775 on the ground that there were sufficient legal farthings and halfpennies in commerce. The farthing would not be struck again by the Royal Mint until 1821.  Soho and renewed regal issues (1799‚Äì1837)  Reverse of an 1807 Boulton-struck farthing From 1775, most copper coins in circulation were counterfeit. The private sector eventually reacted, filling the gap with private tokens starting in 1787, and the Treasury awarded a contract to Matthew Boulton to strike copper coins in 1797. At his Soho Mint near Birmingham, Boulton produced the well- known Cartwheel pennies and twopences, so named for their appearance, the first official British coins struck by steam. The contract did not include producing farthings, though Boulton prepared several patterns. In 1799, Boulton was given a licence to produce halfpennies and farthings. In the meantime the price of copper had risen, and a more conventional coin was struck. The 1799 farthing broke new ground in two areas: the reverse was inscribed , the first time the name of a denomination had ever appeared on an English or British coin, and it was also the first British coin to have the date on the same side as the monarch's head. The inscription on the obverse became , and the reverse depicts a redesigned left-facing seated Britannia holding a spray and spear, with the inscription . In 1806‚Äì1807 a further 22.5 tons (23 tonnes) of copper was struck into farthings by Boulton, but the price of copper had risen again and the weight was less than the 1799 issue. Farthings of the 1799 issue weigh , with a diameter , while the later Boulton issue weighs 4.7‚Äì4.8 grammes (0.17 oz) with a diameter . For the 1806‚Äì1807 issues, the denomination was removed from the coin, was abbreviated as , and the image of Britannia was slightly modified. Copper farthings and halfpennies from before 1797 were called in by proclamation dated 5 December 1817, and were redeemed by weight. Obverse of the 1822 farthing, by Benedetto Pistrucci The currency was reformed in the 1810s with the Great Recoinage of 1816. The production of copper coins did not resume until after George III's death in 1820 and the accession of King George IV (1820‚Äì1830). Farthings were produced in 1821, Britannia maintaining her place on the reverse. These pieces were made current by a proclamation of 14 November of that year, that made them legal tender to sixpence. The original coinage portrait of the King, by Benedetto Pistrucci, attracted strong royal dislike, but was used on the farthing in 1821 and in 1823‚Äì26. By then, Pistrucci had been barred from work on the coinage for refusing to copy the work of another artist. William Wyon was given the task of engraving what became the more flattering \\"bare head\\" type of 1826. The issue of coppers in 1826 was because of the withdrawal of separate issues for Ireland; the Irish penny had been valued at of its British equivalent. The reverse was redesigned slightly, but remained more or less the same. The Pistrucci-designed farthings weighed , with a diameter of ; the later ones by Wyon (issued each year from 1826‚Äì1830) weighed with a diameter of 22 millimetres. Both Pistrucci's and Wyon's designs were produced in 1826. The Pistrucci obverse shows a left-facing bust of King George IV with the inscription GEORGIUS IIII DEI GRATIA, while the reverse shows a right-facing helmeted Britannia seated to the left of the coin, holding a shield and trident, with the inscription and the date in the exergue under Britannia. The Wyon obverse shows a laureate bust of King George IV, facing left, with the inscription GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA, while the reverse inscription is unchanged. The death of King George in 1830 brought his brother, King William IV (1830‚Äì1837) to the throne. Wyon, by then Chief Engraver, left the reverse of the farthing unchanged, and for the obverse engraved a portrait of King William by Sir Francis Chantrey. The inscriptions were unchanged, except that (William IV) was substituted for on the obverse. The farthing was produced in 1831, and 1834‚Äì1837, the final issue being struck during the year of King William's death. Victorian farthings Farthings bearing the portrait of Queen Victoria, by Wyon, were struck beginning in 1838; no change was made to the reverse other than substituting the abbreviation (Regina, or Queen) for (King), indicating there was now a reigning Queen. The farthing remained the same size it had been since 1826. From 1838, the farthing was struck every year of Victoria's long reign except 1870, 1871 and 1889 (the 1877 issue was only in proof and may have been made at a later date). The same obverse dies were used for the copper farthing and the sovereign and most likely were used for the gold coin first. This contributed to a high level of defects in the farthing series, but ensured that they were struck every year, as was the popular gold coin. In Victorian times, a farthing could buy three oysters, with bread and butter, from an oyster-seller walking the streets of London. The coin would be enough to purchase a sparrow at a market in London's East End. In 1859, the Government decided the poor state of the copper coinage demanded its withdrawal. Bronze was deemed a suitable replacement. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny, halfpenny and farthing to be struck from an alloy of metals. Large quantity of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings were struck beginning in 1860 not only by the Royal Mint but by two Birmingham firms under contract. Although the weight of the penny was halved, the farthing was lightened by a bit less than that lest it be too small. The farthing was virtually identical to the penny and halfpenny but for minor details. The new bronze coinage went into circulation in December 1860; the old copper pieces were demonetised after 31 December 1869 in Britain (though the Mint would still accept them until 1873) and at the end of 1877 for the colonies. Reverse of an 1885 farthing The new bronze farthings weighed 2.8‚Äì3.0 grams, were 20 millimetres in diameter, and were made of an alloy of 95% copper, 4% tin and 1% zinc. Disregarding minor changes in alloy, these would remain the farthing's specifications until abolition after 1956. They read on the reverse, with the date in the exergue beneath Britannia. The obverse features the \\"Bun head\\" or \\"Young head\\" of Victoria; both sides of the coin were designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, William's son. The inscription on the obverse was . An \\"H\\" mintmark underneath the date can be seen on some 1874‚Äì1876 and 1881‚Äì1882 farthings; they were struck at the Heaton Mint in Birmingham. Although the Bun farthing series produced several varieties, they are not as extensive as for the penny and halfpenny. The farthing tended to have the lowest mintages of the three bronze coins, between 1 and 6 million being struck in most years in the late Victorian era; more halfpennies were struck than farthings, and mintages of the penny were regularly exceeding 10 million by the 1890s. Although fewer farthings were struck, a larger percentage has survived due to the sentimental attachment of the British people to the coin lowest in denomination. In 1896, a new obverse was introduced to the bronze coinage showing Victoria as an elderly woman. The obverse was designed by Thomas Brock and engraved by George William de Saulles. The farthing continued to display it until the year of the Queen's death, 1901. De Saulles also revised the reverse; the most significant change was the deletion of the lighthouse and ship on either side of Britannia; they would never return to the farthing. The inscription on the Old Head farthing was . Beginning in 1897, farthings were issued artificially darkened; this was to avoid confusion of bright new farthings with the half sovereign; the bronze farthing and the gold piece were the same size.  Twentieth century and abolition (1902‚Äì1956)  The farthing of King Edward VII (1901‚Äì1910), Victoria's son and successor, was struck in every year from 1902 to 1910; it was still artificially darkened. Mintages ranged from 2.6 million (1910) to 8.9 million (1908) at a time when the penny's mintage never dropped below 12 million and rose to 47 million in 1907. A total of ¬£1,021,013 in pennies were struck bearing Edward's portrait, and ¬£222,790 in halfpennies, but only ¬£45,429 in farthings. But for the statement of the coin's value, the designs on the penny, halfpenny and farthing are effectively identical as De Saulles used a Janvier reducing lathe to convert models to dies. The new obverse was his work, showing the king's right-facing bust, with the inscription EDWARDVS VII DEI GRA BRITT OMN REX FID DEF IND IMP. The farthings of Edward's son and successor, King George V, resulted in a new left-facing portrait by Sir Bertram Mackennal and the continuation of the Britannia design. Farthings bearing King George's portrait were produced every year of his reign but 1910 and 1936. Other than substituting (George V) for , no change was made to the inscription. In 1917, the Mint ceased to darken farthings as the half sovereign was no longer being minted. In common with the penny and halfpenny, the King's head was made slightly smaller in 1926. The depiction of Britannia was also slightly adjusted in that year. A total of ¬£5,710,748 in pennies, ¬£1,039,704 in halfpennies and ¬£222,643 in farthings were struck for the reign. The Edward VIII farthing is a pattern which was awaiting royal approval at the time of the abdication in December 1936. There was a movement afoot for more modern coinage designs; the Irish Free State had in 1927 adopted a series of coins depicting animals and some of the colonies had redesigned their coinages. King Edward was also interested in a move away from the heraldry that marked British coinage, showing foreign coins on his watch chain to the Deputy Master of the Mint, Robert Johnson, and asking for more like those. King Edward eventually gave in on the question, fearing that such designs would be unacceptable to the British people, but non-heraldic themes for the halfpenny (a sailing ship) and farthing survived. The selected design for the farthing, a wren, placed the smallest British bird on the British coin smallest in value. In an attempt to break the deadlock between King and Mint, artist Wilson Parker had prepared a series of coinage designs based on what were loosely deemed royal animals: eagle, dove, stag, sturgeon, swan and wren, which though liked by the Advisory Committee (including a young Kenneth Clark) did not receive their endorsement due to the committee's preference for heraldry. Another reason for the change was that the Britannia design, reduced from a model, was difficult to appreciate given the coin's small size. The obverse was designed by Humphrey Paget. King Edward got his way on one matter; his portrait faced left on the patterns, whereas by tradition a monarch faces in the opposite direction from the last reign, and George V had faced left. Edward insisted as he considered his left profile his better side. The only change to the inscription was the substitution of (Edward VIII) for . King George VI wren farthing The wren design was approved for the coinage of Edward's brother and successor, King George VI (1936‚Äì1952); it would stay on the coin for its remaining twenty years. Paget redesigned his obverse to include the new king's left-facing bust, and the wording was adjusted to include . The coin was struck each year from 1937. In 1949, following the independence of India, was removed from the obverse. The accession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 brought a new portrait to the farthing the following year, designed by Mary Gillick. The obverse inscription was in 1953, and thereafter. This change was a recognition that some of the nations of the British Commonwealth were republics. In the years after the Second World War, the farthing had seen more use, as the standard one-pound (454 g) bread loaf had its price set by government, and the price included an odd halfpenny; thus a cash transaction for the purchase of a half-pound loaf by itself required a farthing, either with the payment or change. By the 1950s, due to inflation, the purchasing power of the farthing had dropped, as had commercial demand. Letters to The Times reflected this reality: one correspondent reported being refused when offering eight farthings to a bus conductor for a twopenny fare, and a vendor becoming abusive when offered six farthings for a newspaper. This occurred even though, as a later letter noted, the coin was still legal tender to a shilling. Demand continued to dwindle, and production of the farthing was discontinued after 1956. Eliminating the farthing from commerce also made way for a possible smaller penny and halfpenny that Royal Mint officials contemplated proposing. The farthing ceased to be legal tender after 31 December 1960.

Diesel helped Michaels win the Intercontinental Championship from Marty Jannetty on June 6, 1993. In mid-1994, Michaels acted as Diesel's manager, leading him to winning the Intercontinental Championship from Razor Ramon. The duo transformed into a tag team on Michaels and Diesel defeated The Headshrinkers at a house show to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on August 28, 1994 in Indianapolis, Indiana, days before interference by Michael backfired and cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam on August 29, 1994. At Survivor Series on November 23, 1994, Michaels once again accidentally hit Diesel with a superkick. The team subsequently split, vacating the WWF Tag Team Championship. Three days later, Diesel squashed Bob Backlund at a house show to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. = Second run (1995) = In early 1995, Michaels and Diesel feuded over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Michaels won the Royal Rumble and unsuccessfully challenged Diesel in a title match at WrestleMania XI on April 2, 1995. On the April 3, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw, Diesel came to rescue Michaels from an attack by his replacement bodyguard, Sid. Michaels and Diesel reformed as a team in mid-1995, adopting the moniker \\"Two Dudes with Attitudes\\". At In Your House 3 on September 24, 1995, they challenged WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart and Yokozuna in a match in which the WWF Tag Team Championship, Diesel's WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Michaels' Intercontinental Championship were all on the line. Diesel and Michaels won the match and the Tag Team title but had to return it to Hart and Yokozuna the next day on a technicality following lobbying from Hart's and Yokozuna's lawyer, Clarence Mason. Two Dudes with Attitudes disbanded for a second time after Diesel lost the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Bret Hart at Survivor Series on November 19, 1995. On January 21, 1996, Michaels won the Royal Rumble for a second consecutive year, eliminating Diesel in the process. After Michaels won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hart at WrestleMania XII on March 31, 1996, Diesel unsuccessfully challenged him at In Your House 7: Good Friends, Better Enemies on April 28, 1996. Diesel and Michaels continued to feud until Diesel's departure from the WWF in May 1996. = Reunions (2002, 2003) = Michaels and Nash did not reunite until June 3, 2002, when Kevin Nash named Shawn Michaels as the newest member of the New World Order (nWo). On the June 10 episode of Raw, Michaels explained that his best friend, Kevin Nash, was always there for him, which was why he returned to WWE to become a member of the nWo. He then shocked the audience by hitting Booker T with a superkick to remove him from the nWo. A month later, Nash tore his quadriceps, which broke up the nWo. When Nash returned from his injury in 2003, the duo teamed with Booker T to face Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair, and Randy Orton) in an effort to have Nash win the World Heavyweight Championship from Triple H. At Judgment Day, Nash came close to winning the title until Triple H got himself disqualified when he hit referee Earl Hebner with the sledgehammer in the chest.

Zar-baqsh was a descendant of the prophet Muhammad through his daughter, Fatimah and her husband, Ali, and thus was of the Rizvi family, in the 14th generation from Muhammad. Zar-baqsh's father was Yaqoob and his grandfather was Ahmad (924‚Äì969 AD), a naqib (official investigator) of Qom.

Saiyeds of Zaidpur Shajraat-Taiyyabaat (1916). Anwaar-e-Qom (1953). = Zar-baqsh = Zar-baqsh was born and raised in Qom. He later moved to Jajarm, now in current day North Khurasan, Iran. He was a scholar and a spiritual figure with miracles attributed to him. For example, under his spiritual power, gold fell from the sky, leading to his name \\"Zar-baqsh\\", the \\"one who gives gold\\". Due to persecution of the Saiyeds, (descendants of Muhammad), Zar-baqsh went to Lahore, Hindustan and from there, he travelled east, reaching a place in a forest, with a well, where he founded Zaidpur. This location was from the fort of Dawood Ghazi of Satrikh, an earlier immigrant, regional Muslim ruler, and a general of the sultan, Mahmood Ghaznavi. Zar-baqsh married Bibi Yadgaar Bano, daughter of Dawood Ghazi. Dawood Ghazi's Mazaar (mausoleum), the Budhe Baba Ki Mazaar is in Satrikh, Barabanki district. Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud (1015‚Äì1032CE), the son of Dawood Ghazi and Sitr-e-Mu‚Äôalla (the sister of the Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi ), is entombed in Bahraich. Zar-basqh retired to a quiet spiritual life at the Dada Abdullah Ka Talaab well (known locally as the \\"Dada Dullan Ka Talab\\"). Later, a nearby village was founded and named Abdallahpur after Zar-baqsh. In 1089CE, Zar-baqsh set out on a three-year- long, holy pilgrimage to Mecca. In 493 Hijri (1099CE), he left again. In 493 Hijri (1100CE), in Jajarm, in North Khorasan Province, Iran. Zar-baqsh died of an illness and is buried there. = Zaid = Zaid, the son of Zar-baqsh, was a saintly scholar to whom miracles have been attributed. At eighteen, he married Bibi Kaneez Bano, the daughter of Sulaiman of Satrikh for whom the town, Sulaimanabad is named. Sulaiman was the nephew of Dawood Ghazi. Before Zar- baqsh left on his pilgrimage, he gave to his son, Zaid, the hereditary and traditional family lore. He also asked that his first born grandson be named Mahmood. The child was born in 1100 AD and a village near Zaidpur was named Mahmoodpur after the boy. After the death of Zar-baqsh, Zaid retired to a life of solitude and devotion in the mohalla Gadhi-Qadeem in Zaidpur. Zaid died on 16th Rabi-us-Sani, 526 Hijri, 6 March 1132 AD at age 64 and was buried by his mother's side, near the Dada Abdullah Ka Talaab well on the outskirts of Zaidpur.

John Keats dedicated this poem to the late poet Thomas Chatterton. The poem begins with the line \\"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever\\". Endymion is written in rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter (also known as heroic couplets). Keats based the poem on the Greek myth of Endymion, the shepherd beloved of the moon goddess Selene. The poem elaborates on the original story and renames Selene \\"Cynthia\\" (an alternative name for Artemis). Narrative It starts by painting a rustic scene of trees, rivers, shepherds, and sheep. The shepherds gather around an altar and pray to Pan, god of shepherds and flocks. As the youths sing and dance, the elder men sit and talk about what life would be like in the shades of Elysium. However, Endymion, the \\"brain-sick shepherd- prince\\" of Mt. Latmos, is in a trancelike state, and not participating in their discourse. His sister, Peona, takes him away and brings him to her resting place where he sleeps. After he wakes, he tells Peona of his encounter with Cynthia, and how much he loved her. The poem is divided into four books, each approximately 1,000 lines long. Book I gives Endymion's account of his dreams and experiences, as related to Peona, which provides the background for the rest of the poem. In Book II, Endymion ventures into the underworld in search of his love. He encounters Adonis and Venus--a pairing of mortal and immortal--apparently foreshadowing a similar destiny for the mortal Endymion and his immortal paramour. Book III reveals Endymion's enduring love, and he begs the Moon not to torment him any longer as he journeys through a watery void on the sea floor. There he meets Glaucus, freeing the god from a thousand years of imprisonment by the witch Circe. Book IV, \\"And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain.\\" Endymion falls in love with a beautiful Indian maiden. Both ride winged black steeds to Mount Olympus where Cynthia awaits, only for Endymion to forsake the goddess for his new, mortal, love. Endymion and the Indian girl return to earth, the latter saying she cannot be his love. He is miserable, 'til quite suddenly he comes upon the Indian maiden again and she reveals that she is in fact Cynthia. She then tells him of how she tried to forget him, to move on, but that in the end, \\"'There is not one,/ No, no, not one/ But thee.'\\" Critical reception Endymion received scathing criticism after its release,The Quarterly Review April 1818 pp. 204‚Äì208; John Gibson Lockhart, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine August 1818 and Keats himself noted its diffuse and unappealing style. Keats did not regret writing it, as he likened the process to leaping into the ocean to become more acquainted with his surroundings; in a poem to J. A. Hessey, he expressed that \\"I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest.\\" However, he did express regret in its publishing, saying \\"it is not without a feeling of regret that I make [Endymion] public.\\" Not all critics disliked the work. The poet Thomas Hood wrote 'Written in Keats' Endymion', in which the \\"Muse... charming the air to music... gave back Endymion in a dreamlike tale\\". Henry Morley said, \\"The song of Endymion throbs throughout with a noble poet's sense of all that his art means for him. What mechanical defects there are in it may even serve to quicken our sense of the youth and freshness of this voice of aspiration.\\" In popular culture This poem is quoted by Monsieur Verdoux in Charlie Chaplin's homonymous film, before committing a moonlit murder. \\"Our feet were soft in flowers...\\". The first line (\\"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever\\") is quoted by Mary Poppins in the 1964 Disney movie, while she pulls out a potted plant from her bag. It is also referenced by Willy Wonka in the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory upon introducing the Wonkamobile, and in the 1992 American sports comedy film White Men Can't Jump, written and directed by Ron Shelton.

E. Lloyd, O. M. Edwards, T. E. Ellis (leader, MP for Merioneth, 1886‚Äì1899), Beriah Gwynfe Evans and Alfred Thomas. Initially it was a purely London-based society, later expanding to cities in England with a large Welsh population. The founders of Cymru Fydd were influenced by the nationalist movement in Ireland, although the movement also drew upon other ideas, including a sense of imperial mission as preached by John Ruskin and a programme of social and political reform promoted by Arnold Toynbee and the Fabian Society. This was therefore in stark contrast to Irish Nationalism, under Charles Stewart Parnell and others, which sought separation from British political structures. The movement resembled the cultural nationalism found in parts of continental Europe, and heavily influenced by members of the intelligentsia such as O. M. Edwards and J. E. Lloyd. From 1892 branches were organised in Wales itself, the first being formed at Barry by W. Llewelyn Williams. Its main objective was to gain self-government for Wales. The movement lost some of its impetus following the withdrawal of T. E. Ellis to join the Government in 1892, after which the leadership of Cymru Fydd was taken over by David Lloyd George and Herbert Lewis (MP for Flint Boroughs). Cymru Fydd was re-launched on a narrower, more political basis. \\"Disestablishment, Cymru Fydd and Plaid Cymru\\", accessed June 22, 2020 After an initial period of success in 1894‚Äì95, in which time it merged with the North Wales Liberal Federation (18 April 1895) to form the Welsh National Federation, it met with fierce opposition from the South Wales Liberal Federation, led by the Federation President, David Alfred Thomas (MP for Merthyr Tydfil 1889‚Äì1910). On 16 January 1896, the proposal to merge the South Wales Liberal Federation with the Welsh National Federation was put to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the South Wales Liberal Federation, held at Newport, Monmouthshire. Lloyd George was howled down and refused permission to speak. After Robert Bird, a senior Cardiff alderman, declared his determination to resist \\"the domination of Welsh ideas\\", the merger proposal was defeated. Cymru Fydd collapsed soon afterwards. The effect of this collapse was particularly severe on the Women's Liberal Associations, all but 15 of which collapsed. Lloyd George switched his attention to British matters, next coming to prominence as an opponent of the Boer War. The movement was supported by the magazine Young Wales, edited by John Hugh Edwards between 1895 and its collapse in 1896. An earlier magazine, Cymru Fydd, ceased publication in 1891.

If the intersection form is positive (negative) definite, it can be diagonalized to the identity matrix (negative identity matrix) over the . History The theorem was proved by Simon Donaldson. This was a contribution cited for his Fields medal in 1986. Idea of proof Donaldson's proof utilizes the moduli space \\\\mathcal{M}_P of solutions to the anti-self-duality equations on a principal \\\\operatorname{SU}(2)-bundle P over the four-manifold. By the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem, the dimension of the moduli space is given by :\\\\dim \\\\mathcal{M} = 8k - 3(1-b_1(X) + b_+(X)), where c_2(P)=k, b_1(X) is the first Betti number of X and b_+(X) is the dimension of the positive-definite subspace of H_2(X,\\\\mathbb{R}) with respect to the intersection form. When X is simply- connected with definite intersection form, possibly after changing orientation, one always has b_1(X) = 0 and b_+(X)=0. Thus taking any principal \\\\operatorname{SU}(2)-bundle with k=1, one obtains a moduli space \\\\mathcal{M} of dimension five. Cobordism given by Yang‚ÄìMills moduli space in Donaldson's theorem This moduli space is non-compact and generically smooth, with singularities occurring only at the points corresponding to reducible connections, of which there are exactly b_2(X) many.Donaldson, S. K. (1983). An application of gauge theory to four-dimensional topology. Journal of Differential Geometry, 18(2), 279-315. Results of Clifford Taubes and Karen Uhlenbeck show that whilst \\\\mathcal{M} is non-compact, its structure at infinity can be readily described.Taubes, C. H. (1982). Self-dual Yang‚ÄìMills connections on non-self-dual 4-manifolds. Journal of Differential Geometry, 17(1), 139-170.Uhlenbeck, K. K. (1982). Connections with L p bounds on curvature. Communications in Mathematical Physics, 83(1), 31-42.Uhlenbeck, K. K. (1982). Removable singularities in Yang‚ÄìMills fields. Communications in Mathematical Physics, 83(1), 11-29. Namely, there is an open subset of \\\\mathcal{M}, say \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\varepsilon}, such that for sufficiently small choices of parameter \\\\varepsilon, there is a diffeomorphism :\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\quad \\\\cong\\\\quad} X\\\\times (0,\\\\varepsilon). The work of Taubes and Uhlenbeck essentially concerns constructing sequences of ASD connections on the four-manifold X with curvature becoming infinitely concentrated at any given single point x\\\\in X. For each such point, in the limit one obtains a unique singular ASD connection, which becomes a well-defined smooth ASD connection at that point using Uhlenbeck's removable singularity theorem. Donaldson observed that the singular points in the interior of \\\\mathcal{M} corresponding to reducible connections could also be described: they looked like cones over the complex projective plane \\\\mathbb{CP}^2, with its orientation reversed. It is thus possible to compactify the moduli space as follows: First, cut off each cone at a reducible singularity and glue in a copy of \\\\mathbb{CP}^2. Secondly, glue in a copy of X itself at infinity. The resulting space is a cobordism between X and a disjoint union of b_2(X) copies of \\\\mathbb{CP}^2 with its orientation reversed. The intersection form of a four-manifold is a cobordism invariant up to isomorphism of quadratic forms, from which one concludes the intersection form of X is diagonalisable. Extensions Michael Freedman had previously shown that any unimodular symmetric bilinear form is realized as the intersection form of some closed, oriented four-manifold. Combining this result with the Serre classification theorem and Donaldson's theorem, several interesting results can be seen: 1) Any non-diagonalizable intersection form gives rise to a four-dimensional topological manifold with no differentiable structure (so cannot be smoothed). 2) Two smooth simply-connected 4-manifolds are homeomorphic, if and only if, their intersection forms have the same rank, signature, and parity.

It was first presented to the press at a Paris restaurant named \\"Les Ambassadeurs\\" on 17 June 1953 and went into production the following year. In 1959 it was replaced by the Panhard PL 17. Background Panhard was one of the world's oldest auto manufacturers and since 1945 had become known for producing economical cars. Panhard, like Citro√´n, considered itself a leader, not a follower of automotive trends, and the Dyna Z featured an impressive array of unusual engineering choices. In 1955 Citro√´n had taken a 25% holding in Panhard's automobile business and during the next two years the national dealership networks of the two businesses were integrated. This gave Citroen and Panhard dealers an expanded market coverage, incorporating now a small car, a medium-sized saloon and a large car range. It gave the Panhard Dyna Z, during its final years in production, a level of market access that its predecessor had never enjoyed. Sales benefited. Model development The Dyna X was replaced by the more streamlined Dyna Z in 1954. This was later developed into the similar PL 17, launched in 1959, in an attempt to conform to the styles of the time. Like its predecessor the Dyna X and the Panhard Dynavia concept that influenced its design, the Dyna Z's body was originally aluminium with steel tube subframes front and rear joined by steel plate reinforcements in the sills. The decision to use aluminium sheeting for car bodies had been taken at a time when a sudden drop off in demand for fighter planes had left the producers with a glut of the metal, but in subsequent years the relative cost advantage of sheet steel had increased steadily. Other sources emphasize an underlying error with the original costings for the model which had taken no account of the off-cuts from the aluminium coils after the blanks for the body panels had been cut from them. Jean Panhard's explanation to a sympathetic interviewer concludes with the observation that \\"nobody wanted to buy offcuts except at a ridiculously low price, this difference was our profit margin.\\" In Summer 1954 the cost penalty of persisting with aluminium bodywork had become financially unsustainable, and from September 1955 the Dynas Type \\"Z1\\" switched to steel bodywork, even though the door shells, trunk/boot and hood/bonnet were at this stage still made of aluminium. The switch to a sheet-steel body shell, attributed to \\"various setbacks\\" (\\"nombreuses d√©boires\\") with the aluminium body of the earlier Type Z1, imposed an instant weight penalty of 123 Kg. and had to be accompanied by a substantial redesign of the front suspension and a change to the shock absorbers, though cost savings were too late to avoid the need for Panhard to sign their ultimately suicidal refinancing \\"agreement\\" with Citro√´n in April 1955. By 1958, only the bumpers, the fuel tank, the engine cooling shroud and most of the engine and transaxle cases were aluminium, but the weight was still quite low for a relatively comfortable six-seater saloon, when compared with narrower competitor models from Peugeot and Simca. Its unusual and very modern design gave it a unique combination of space, ride comfort, performance and fuel economy at a very competitive price. But reliability suffered and fuel prices were not high enough, even in France, for people to put energy efficiency first. The car also suffered from some engine and wind noise. The Tiger version had a racing inspired engine and a full cooling shroud. { Panhard Dyna Z 4-door saloon Panhard Dyna Z 2-door cabriolet Panhard Dyna Z 2-door pickup 1000 Lakes Rally-winning Panhard Dyna Z }  Specifications of 1958 Panhard Dyna Z Tiger bicolor Dyna Z Œïnhanced specification/performance version as sold in the US: *Price (USD): $2000 (comparable to a basic United States car, and midway between prices of a Volkswagen Beetle and a Peugeot 403) *Engine: 851 cc Flat-twin :-- Four- stroke, air-cooled, concentric torsion bar valve springs on roller bearings, hollow aluminum push rods with hardened steel tips, roller main bearings and big end rod bearings of \\"Panhard Patent\\" design with an additional set of smaller rollers carrying the roller cage (separator); non-removable cylinder heads, removable steel cylinder liners.

He was the older brother of wrestlers Paul and Vivian Vachon, and the uncle of wrestler Luna Vachon. Vachon started his career as an amateur wrestler, participating in the 1948 Summer Olympics and winning a gold medal at the 1950 British Empire Games. He made the switch to professional wrestling and spent time in various promotions in the United States while occasionally teaming with his brother Paul. In Portland, Oregon, he received the name \\"Mad Dog\\" Vachon. In the early 1960s, Vachon became a main eventer in the American Wrestling Association. He was one of the promotion's all-time great heels, known for his wild style and intense interviews. He was a five-time AWA World Heavyweight Champion. Starting in the 1970s, Vachon became a fan favourite, particularly in his home province of Quebec. After a stint in the World Wrestling Federation, Vachon retired from the business in 1986. The following year, he was struck by a hit-and-run driver, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. Vachon was highly influential, especially in Canada, and was inducted into numerous professional wrestling halls of fame. Early life Joseph Maurice R√©gis Vachon was born on September 14, 1929. The godfather was Maurice Picard, his uncle and the godmother was Victoria Ouellet, his maternal grandmother; he was the second of 13 children of Montreal policeman Ferdinand Vachon and Marguerite Picard. He grew up in the district of Ville-√âmard, a working-class borough southwest of Montreal, Quebec. As a child, he regularly attended wrestling shows at the nearby Montreal Forum, where he grew up idolizing local ring legend Yvon Robert; and at just 12 years old, he had already begun grappling at the area's YMCA. At the YMCA he was coached by Frank Saxton, a former coach of the Canadian amateur team. Vachon entered a wrestling course advertised at the back of a comic book, and he began training under Chief Jim Crowley. He trained hard and even worked in the docks and on the canal to build up his muscle. By age 14, Vachon had established himself among Canada's premier amateur grapplers. At the age of 18, he competed in the 1948 Olympic Games in London, where he pinned the Indian champion in 54 seconds. Vachon ultimately finished in seventh place at 174 pounds after losing to eventual silver medalist Adil Candemir of Turkey. Moreover, it was at the 1948 Olympics where Vachon first encountered an American Greco-Roman competitor named Verne Gagne. He rebounded to win the gold medal at the 1950 British Empire Games in New Zealand. He then spent several years working as a bouncer at a Montreal nightclub, where he gained a reputation of being willing to fight anyone, before he was encouraged to join the pro wrestling circuit in 1951. Professional wrestling career =Wrestling debut= Vachon initially debuted as a junior heavyweight for Ontario booker Larry Kasaboski; and during his first year as a pro, he won a tournament in Sudbury to claim the North American Junior Heavyweight Title. However, Vachon soon encountered a roadblock when powerful Montreal promoter Eddie Quinn was hesitant to use him for fear that Vachon would dethrone Yvon Robert, who was still his top drawing card. Consequently, Vachon then took to the road; and in April 1955, he teamed with Pierre LaSalle to capture the NWA Texas Tag Team Titles. =\\"Mad Dog\\" Vachon= Despite his exceptional grappling ability, Vachon nonetheless struggled to distinguish himself from the myriad of image-less grapplers during his early years. As a result, he soon took radical measures to differentiate his persona, bulking up to a more plausible 225 pounds while also shaving his head bald and growing a long goatee. In addition, Vachon would frequently buy local TV time prior to a weekend event, which he then used to boldly proclaim his supremacy while also deprecating his opponent. Such acts of bravado were considered revolutionary at the time, though it was successful in that it attracted attention to Vachon's new character as well as drawing additional fans to the arena. As a result, Vachon subsequently established himself as a major heel while also portraying a wrestling beast inside the ring who would freely stomp, bite, and pound his opponent into submission. According to Vachon, the name \\"Mad Dog\\" was given to him in 1962 by Portland promoter Don Owen after a particularly violent match. \\"During the match I went outside the ring and started to turn everything upside down. A policeman tried to stop me and I hit him too,\\" said Vachon. Afterwards Owen told him, \\"You just looked like a real mad dog out there.\\" Before long, \\"Mad Dog\\" Vachon consequently developed a reputation as perhaps the most feared rulebreaker in all of wrestling. Furthermore, Maurice's younger brother Paul - ultimately known as \\"The Butcher\\" - soon also made his debut and on February 17, 1959 the Vachon brothers teamed to defeat Chico Garcia and Chet Wallick for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Titles. Vachon's tendency to hurt his opponents with foreign objects, filed fingernails and teeth, and the multiple use of his signature finishing move, the piledriver, to end matches made him notorious in the business and caused him to be banned in three U.S. states. But it also made his popularity soar among the fans. He also met his future wife Kathie Joe at a wrestling event, after spitting a shoe string he had used for choking his opponent at her, as she was sitting in the audience. =AWA World Heavyweight Champion= In the early 1960s, Mad Dog Vachon was then recruited to the Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association by his old Olympics acquaintance, Verne Gagne, who had replaced Tony Stecher as the region's chief promoter in 1960 and who also served as its centerpiece champion. Upon debuting, Vachon immediately established himself among the promotion's top box-office draws as fans despised his vicious, mauling tactics; and he thus made the perfect opponent for the All-American Gagne, as the two rivals soon commenced an ongoing battle that would persist on for nearly 20 years. On May 2, 1964, Vachon stunned audiences when he upset Gagne for the AWA World Heavyweight Title, and although Gagne regained the belt just two weeks later, Mad Dog again recaptured the title when he defeated Gagne on October 20 in Minneapolis. Between 1964‚Äì67, Mad Dog Vachon would ultimately hold five reigns as the AWA World champion while taking on all comers within the promotion's massive territory, including Gagne, Mighty Igor Vodic, as well as the legendary powerhouse duo of Crusher Lisowski and Dick the Bruiser. Mad Dog Vachon's final AWA title reign came to an end on February 26, 1967, at the hands of his nemesis Verne Gagne; and he then briefly left the promotion in order to return to his native Montreal territory, where he captured two reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight champion while feuding against Johnny Rougeau and Hans Schmidt. Moreover, Vachon would also leverage his close friendship with Montreal Canadiens legend Jean Beliveau to convince the authorities of the Montreal Forum to grant him a promoting license (despite the protests of Johnny Rougeau and Bob Langevin, who had taken over the region from Eddie Quinn during the mid-1960s). Nevertheless, Vachon would soon return to the AWA, where he resumed his fierce battles with The Crusher and Dick the Bruiser, regarded by some as the greatest tag team of all-time, while forming a highly successful and dangerous tandem with his brother Paul \\"Butcher\\" Vachon. On August 30, 1969, the Vachons defeated Crusher and Bruiser for the AWA World Tag Team Titles; and the following year, the two battled again in a famous steel cage match at Chicago's Comiskey Park (where the Vachons again emerged victorious), as their violent fights ultimately served as the precursor for a new brand of sadistic and vicious brawling that would spawn future stars like Abdullah the Butcher, Bruiser Brody, Stan Hansen, and others. On July 14, 1973, Vachon had a match with Killer Kowalski for Grand Prix Wrestling at Montreal's Jarry Park. The match drew a crowd of 29,127, which is the largest wrestling crowd in Quebec history. Prior to the match, Vachon had vowed to commit suicide if he did not win. Following Vachon's victory, the headline of a Montreal newspaper read \\"Vachon triumphs in front of 30,000 people and gives up on suicide!\\"Laprade, pp. 60‚Äì67 =Later career= The Vachon family became prominent in the AWA with sister Vivian dominating the women's scene, while Maurice and Paul ruled the men's division. In the early 1970s he even appeared alongside Vivian in the motion picture Wrestling Queen. After two decades as one the wrestling's most evil characters, the fans began to rally behind the \\"Mad Dog\\" in the late 1970s when he formed an unexpected and odd friendship with ex-archrival Verne Gagne. The unlikely partners made for an impressive tag team, and on June 6, 1979, they beat Pat Patterson & Ray Stevens to capture the AWA tag titles, which they held for over a year before losing to Jesse Ventura & Adrian Adonis. When the AWA began looking to younger stars like Rick Martel and Curt Hennig, Vachon jumped to the World Wrestling Federation in 1983. While his age and lack of size did not make for a good mix in the emerging \\"Hulkamania\\" era, the now-face (fan favorite) Vachon was usually included at WWF house shows (wrestling cards) in the Midwest and Quebec. He wrestled for the WWF in Canada regularly until 1986, and even contributed to the WWF's French programming by doing a weekly interview segment in French titled Le Brunch a Mad Dog. While contracted with the WWF, Vachon was allowed to participate in events not featuring the WWF while in Canada. In 1985, he appeared as cornerman for AWA World Champion Rick Martel when Martel was challenged by Boris Zhukov in several title bouts in Canada, getting involved in one match on September 19, 1985 in Winnipeg and fighting off Zhukov and his manager, Chris Markoff, after Markoff interfered and helped Zhukov attack Martel,Rick Martel vs. Boris Zhukov - September 19, 1985, Winnipeg at YouTube while in a later rematch between Martel and Zhukov held in a steel cage on November 14, 1985 in the same city, Markoff was neutralized by being handcuffed to Vachon.Rick Martel vs. Boris Zhukov Cage Match Part 1 - November 14, 1985, Winnipeg at YouTubeRick Martel vs. Boris Zhukov Cage Match Part 2 - November 14, 1985, Winnipeg at YouTube Vachon received a retirement show in his native Montreal in September 1986, and he left the sport as one its most beloved fan favorites after spending almost his entire career as a sadistic villain. His innovative portrayal of a snarling, bloodthirsty monster would inspire a myriad of future \\"psychotic\\" wrestlers. According to the WWE, \\"In later years, Mad Dog's legacy was carried on by his niece, the memorably twisted Luna Vachon, and notable brawlers who adopted Vachon's wild ring style like Bruiser Brody and George \\"The Animal\\" Steele.\\" Influence Vachon was known for his wild personality and uncontrollable character, as well as his unique interview style. \\"He was the first wrestler to understand the power of television. He was the first wrestler to speak to the camera. That was never done before.\\" said Yves Theriault, who directed a documentary on Vachon in 2009. Vachon was also very influential in his home province of Quebec. Pat LaPrade, author of the Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs, a book on Quebec wrestling history, considers Vachon one of the two most important Quebec wrestlers along with Yvon Robert. He added, \\"[Vachon is] the best-known Quebec wrestler outside of Quebec. A legend.\\" In the book The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Canadians, author Greg Oliver ranks Vachon fourth amongst Canadian wrestlers, behind Whipper Billy Watson, Yvon Robert and Killer Kowalski.Oliver, 2003, pp. 16‚Äì21 Vachon was also included in Oliver's book on villainous wrestlers and was ranked fourth.Oliver, 2007, pp. 33‚Äì36 Retirement and personal life Upon retiring, Vachon settled in Carter Lake, Iowa with his third wife Kathy Joe. Tragedy struck in 1987 when Vachon was struck by a hit-and-run driver, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. It was later revealed that he had been struck by a developmentally challenged male driving the country roads looking for cans to recycle while Vachon was out for a morning jog. The man apparently had no insurance and was never charged. The Vachons moved to Omaha shortly thereafter. He later turned to acting in beer commercials and was a restaurant critic for a Quebec City television station. He appeared at the WWF pay-per- view In Your House 7, that was held in Omaha. He was sitting in the front row near ringside, when his artificial leg was ripped off by wrestler Diesel and used as a weapon by Shawn Michaels. In addition, he and longtime rival The Crusher made an appearance at the 1998 Over the Edge pay-per-view, in a segment where the two legends were mocked by Jerry Lawler, including Lawler trying to steal the artificial leg. Crusher and Mad Dog then punched Lawler out of the ring. He had knee surgery in 2008. On March 27, 2010, he was inducted into the 2010 WWE Hall of Fame. Vachon, who in his last years suffered from diabetes and was confined to a wheelchair, died in his sleep on November 21, 2013, at the age of 84.http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radio- canada.ca%2Fsports%2FPlusSports%2F2013%2F11%2F21%2F001-mad-dog-vachon- deces.shtml%2F He had six children, seven grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren.

The Austen (from \\"Australian Sten\\") was a 9√ó19mm Australian submachine gun derived from the British Sten gun developed during the Second World War. In total 19,914 Austens were produced during the war by Diecasters Ltd of Melbourne and W. T. Carmichael Ltd of Sydney.  Design and development  With the war in Europe demanding most of the available material for the British, Australia was not in a position to purchase weapons from the United Kingdom or the United States, and so they had to develop their own submachine guns. The British Sten submachine gun was taken as the basis for the Austen.McNab 2001, p. 86. The barrel, body (receiver) and trigger mechanism of the Mark II Sten were copied, while the folding stock and bolt, with separate firing pin and telescopic cover over the return spring, were copied from the German MP40. The folding stock also included a screwdriver and a cleaning rod which both unscrewed from the tubes of the stock. The weapon also featured twin pistol-style grips; the latter containing a small spare parts container inside. The weapon had a selective- fire feature permitting the firer to fire single shots or fully automatic at 500 rounds per minute. An interesting production feature of the Austen was that some parts were manufactured by the diecasting process. These parts were the magazine housing, part of the mechanism for the stock and the forward half of the magazine. The magazine loader was also diecast. The two firms manufacturing the Austen were specialist diecasting companies. There was a suppressed version made for use by Z Special Force. An improved version, the Mark II Austen, was introduced but was not ready until 1946, after the end of the Second World War. This model made even more extensive use of diecasting; the large grip assemblies at both the front and back of the gun were produced in this way. 200 examples were built, and these were both adopted and declared obsolete in August 1946. The Austen never achieved the level of popularity that the Owen gun achieved. This was largely because the Owen was a very reliable weapon and although the Austen was an improvement on the basic Sten, it was never able to achieve the Owen's reliability. Additionally, it has been asserted that the Owen was much more suited to jungle warfare. No doubt the Austen's side-mounted magazine and bolt proved a hindrance to soldiers in the jungle, as this aspect necessarily meant that the working parts were more exposed to dirt and therefore prone to fouling due to the cocking slot's position on the right-hand side of the body. Regarded as obsolete by 1945, the Austen was rarely used in subsequent decades. In contrast, the Owen was widely used by the Australian Army until the 1960s.McNab 2001, p. 87.

Plot Ella is a lonely and misunderstood young woman who lives in a European duchy who has become a lowly servant to her stepmother, the Widow Sonder, and stepsisters, Birdena and Serafina. She is shunned by the townspeople because of her anti-social behavior and nicknamed \\"Cinderella\\". In the face of ridicule, Ella boasts that she will live in the palace one day (as a fortune-teller once told her late mother). Prince Charles, son of the Duke who rules the principality, has been studying abroad for years; his return being celebrated by three days of festivities and a ball on the final day. He starts to recall old memories he had of growing up there, including a small girl with unbearably sad eyes whom he saw when he was just a boy. After getting into a spat with her stepfamily, Ella runs away to her favorite place, a small secluded pool on the Palace grounds. There she meets the eccentric town vagrant Mrs. Toquet who becomes her first friend. The next day she returns to the spot, hoping to meet Mrs. Toquet, but instead finds Charles and his friend Kovin. Ella asks them where they are from and they tell her that they come from the Palace and that Charles is the son of the Chief Cook. Charles then recognizes Ella's eyes as those belonging to the girl he saw years ago. Ella thinks that he is making fun of her and pushes him into the pool. The Sonder home is visited by their wealthy Cousin Loulou. Ella is supposed to be cleaned up to receive their guest, but her stepfamily is scandalized when they discover that she is barefoot. Ella remembers that she left her shoes at the pond and runs off to collect them, where she finds Charles waiting for her. Ella apologizes for pushing him into the water and he apologizes for hurting her feelings. Charles gives her an invitation to the Ball and a quick dancing lesson. After a waltz Charles steals a kiss and Ella runs away. After the Widow Sonder, Birdena, and Serafina leave for the ball, Mrs. Toquet arrives, bringing a pair of glass slippers and one of Cousin Loulou's fancy ballgowns, claiming she has \\"borrowed\\" it for Ella's use. She has also arranged for a coach to take Ella to the palace and warns her to leave by midnight so as not to inconvenience the coachman's other clients. At the Ball, Ella is besieged by young men wanting to dance with her, but she refuses to speak to anyone, trying to reach the Palace kitchens to find Charles. Charles learns of her presence and waltzes with her, revealing his true identity. The other guests note the unknown newcomer's exotic appearance and surmise (because of her short hair) that she is an Egyptian princess. As the clock strikes midnight, Ella runs off to escape her suspicious stepfamily, leaving one of her glass slippers behind, which is then picked up by Charles. While fleeing the palace, Ella's coach overturns and she is knocked unconscious; lying next to her on the ground are a pumpkin and several mice. Ella wakes up back home and is greeted by Mrs. Toquet, who informs Ella that everything she borrowed is back where it belongs. Prince Charles informs his father that he has met the woman he wants to marry. Kovin, picking up on what he's overheard at the ball, hurriedly \\"explains\\" that Ella is an Egyptian princess. By the next morning, everyone has heard that the Prince has chosen an Egyptian Princess to be his bride. When Ella hears this news, she is devastated and decides to run away, first stopping at her favorite place to see Mrs. Toquet, to whom she bids farewell. Ella throws herself on the ground sobbing, until she looks up and sees the Prince, holding her lost glass slipper, which he declares will fit the foot of the princess he intends to marry. A crowd of gatherers, including Ella's stepmother and stepsisters, bow to Ella as she and the Prince ride off to the palace together. Mrs. Toquet, revealed to be Ella's fairy godmother, vanishes, returning to where she came from.

MGM bought the film rights in 1953 as a vehicle for Leslie Caron. Caron had just had a big hit at the studio in Lili so MGM reunited her with that film's producer and director for Glass Slipper. Anatole de Grunwald was assigned to write the script. However eventually script duties went to Helen Deutsch, who wrote Lilli. The Farjeons are not credited on the final film. Deutsch claimed her script was basically an original work: > MGM gave me one word, 'Cinderella'. That's how it started. I read > practically everything written about this famous waif, rejection most > conceptions of the character. Actually my Cinderella of the 18th century is > not based definitely on anyone's ideas but my own. Waifs have intrigued the > reading public for generations; they were popular characters in the early > movies - the Gish era - then gave way to more worldly females. I first > revived the waif successfully in Lili. Lili had a hit song \\"Hi Lili Hi Lo\\", lyrics by Helen Deutsch; the same team wrote one for Glass Slipper, \\"Take My Love\\". Deutsch also wrote the libretto for the ballet scenes. The male lead was given to Michael Wilding, who was then married to MGM contract star Elizabeth Taylor and was under contract to the studio himself. Taina Elg was to have made her dramatic debut in the film but in the end MGM decided to only use her as a dancer. Eventually it was decided that Elg would debut in The Prodigal and not appear in Glass Slipper at all. She was replaced by Liliane Montevecchi. The Ballet de Paris appeared in some scenes. Keenan Wynn was withdrawn from Deep in My Heart to appear in the film. Music The score was composed by Bronislau Kaper and conducted by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, with orchestrations by Robert Franklyn. Additional recording sessions were conducted by Johnny Green. Helen Deutsch wrote lyrics for the song \\"Take My Love\\" to music by Kaper. Vocals for actor Michael Wilding were performed by Gilbert Russell. The complete score, including alternate versions of the three ballets by Kaper, was released in 2005 on compact disc on the Film Score Monthly label. The choreography was by Roland Petit.British Film Institute Archive: Roland Petit, accessed 3 April 2013. Reception According to MGM records the film earned $1,363,000 in the US and Canada and $1,589,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $387,000.

The film is based on the life of rebetiko singer Marika Ninou and gained cult status in Greece.\\".:BiblioNet : Rebetika / F√©rris, K√≥stas\\". Plot This musical drama sweeps through a turbulent 40 years in popular singer Marika's (Sotiria Leonardou) life ‚Äì and in the history of Greece ‚Äì starting with the singer's birth in Smyrna, Turkey in 1917. Marika was deported to Greece along with all the other Greeks in Smyrna when she was seven years old, and a few years later, her parents started a career as a musician and a singer in a nightclub/bar. In the short space of one decade, Marika witnesses her father murder her mother, runs away from home, has a baby, and comes back to the nightclub to sing in an act with a childhood friend, Yorgos and a bouzouki player, Babis. Success finally comes at the expense of the suicide of another female singer at the club (named Rosa), but then Yorgos is exiled for political reasons, and she and Babis leave for other venues. Although Marika carries a torch for Babis, their relationship never seems to work out, and after many years and World War II go by, she sends her daughter away to a convent school (to later become a dancer in a cabaret, much to Marika's chagrin) and goes on a tour in America. She then returns to Greece to find herself supplanted by a younger singer named Matina who has caught the attention of Babis. Near the end of the movie, she is stabbed in the stomach the night of her reunion concert. Marika dies of her wounds and is buried by the people she sang with as they sing in her memory at the cemetery. There have been hypotheses that the story is based on the life of Marika Ninou with Babis playing the part of Vasilis Tsitsanis. However, there are glaring differences between the film and the real life of Marika Ninou. Marika Ninou only began singing after World War II. While she went to America, she never went with Vasilis Tsitsanis but in fact went with Kostas Kaplanis. She then returned to Greece and died of cancer. The film mentions a conflict with a singer named Rosa (Roza Eskenazi?) but no such incident has ever been documented. Awards Rembetiko was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival in 1984, and won the Silver Bear. Sotiria Leonardou won the prize for \\"Best Actress\\" at the 1983 Thessaloniki Film Festival for her portrayal of Ninou and the film itself tied for \\"Best Picture\\", and won three other awards as well (two \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" prizes, and one for music).

He is best known as the co-creator of Robin and the Joker and for his work on behalf of creators' rights. He was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2004. Early life Jerry Robinson was born in Trenton, New Jersey, the son of Mae and Benjamin Robinson. He was of Russian Jewish descent.Jewish Journal: \\"Jews Get Geek on at Comic-Con\\" by Adam Wills July 22, 2009 He attended Columbia University, but did not graduate.Dueben, Alex. \\"JERRY ROBINSON: \\"AMBASSADOR OF COMICS\\"\\". Comic Book Resources. October 5, 2010 Career =1939‚Äì1943= Robinson was a 17-year-old journalism student at Columbia University in 1939 when he was discovered by Batman creator Bob Kane, who hired him to work on that fledgling comic as an inker and letterer.Sacks, Ethan. \\"Jerry Robinson, comic book legend and creator of Batman nemesis, the Joker, dead at 89\\". Daily News. December 8, 2011 Kane, with writer Bill Finger, had shortly before created the character Batman for National Comics, the future DC Comics. Robinson rented a room from a family in The Bronx near Kane's family's Grand Concourse apartment, where Kane used his bedroom as an art studio. He started as a letterer and a background inker, shortly graduating to inking secondary figures. Within a year, he became Batman's primary inker, with George Roussos inking backgrounds. Batman quickly became a hit character, and Kane rented space for Robinson and Roussos in Times Square's Times Tower.Groth, Gary. \\"Jerry Robinson: Been There, Done That\\". The Comics Journal #271 & 272\\\\. February 5, 2011 In addition to Batman, Robinson and Roussos did inks and backgrounds on Target and the Targeteers for Novelty Press. Roussos recounted of his collaboration with Robinson: > It was hard to make the deadlines, because Jerry was a heavy sleeper. I used > to have to go to the Bronx to get him to come to work. I'd go and wake him > up 2 o'clock in the afternoon so we could work all night. ... We were > committed to do about 13 pages a week. Jerry was always behind - he was > always whiting out things and re-inking them. Bob's stuff was so sketchy, > Jerry had to do a lot of work. Approximately a year and a half after Robinson, Roussos, and Finger were hired by Kane, National Comics lured them away, making them company staffers. Roussos has claimed that their work on Target and the Targeteers made the series look \\"almost identical to Kane's Batman\\", and National hired them as staffers because they saw that it had become a significant competition for Batman. Robinson recalled working in the bullpen at the company's 480 Lexington Avenue office, alongside Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, as well as Jack Kirby, Fred Ray, and Mort Meskin, \\"one of my best friends, who[m] I brought up from MLJ\\". By early 1940, Kane and Finger discussed adding a sidekick. Robinson suggested the name \\"Robin\\" after Robin Hood books he had read during boyhood, saying (in a 2005 interview) that he was inspired by one book's N.C. Wyeth illustrations. The new character, orphaned circus performer Dick Grayson, came to live with Bruce Wayne (Batman) as his young ward in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940). Robin would inspire many similar sidekicks throughout the remainder of the Golden Age of Comic Books. Detective Comics #38 (May 1940), the debut of Robin. Art by Bob Kane and Robinson Batman's nemesis, the Joker, was introduced around the same time, in Batman #1 (Spring 1940). Though Kane claimed he and writer Bill Finger came up with the idea for the Joker, most comic historians credit Robinson for the iconic villain, modeled after Conrad Veidt in the 1928 film, The Man Who Laughs. Credit for that character's creation, however, is disputed. Robinson has said he created the character. Kane's position was that: Robinson, whose original Joker playing card was on public display in the exhibition \\"Masters of American Comics\\" at the Jewish Museum in New York City, New York, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007, and the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta, Georgia from October 24, 2004 to August 28, 2005, has countered that: Finger provided his own account in 1966: Robinson was also a key force in the creation of Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, and the villain Two-Face.Boucher, Geoff. \\"Jerry Robinson, key creator behind the Joker and Robin, dead at 89\\". Los Angeles Times. December 8, 2011 In 1943, when Kane left the Batman comic books to focus on penciling the daily Batman newspaper comic strip, Robinson took over the full penciling, along with others such as Dick Sprang. Only Kane's name appeared on the strip. =1944‚Äì2007= From 1944 to 1946, Robinson and his friend Meskin formed a studio which produced material for the short-lived Spark Publications. Robinson worked on numerous other characters for several publishers, at one point doing freelance illustrations for a textbook publisher. After leaving superhero comics, he became a newspaper cartoonist and created True Classroom Flubs and Fluffs, which ran during the 1960s in the New York Sunday News (later incorporated into the Daily News). Robinson also did a political satire cartoon panel feature, Still Life which began national syndication on June 3, 1963.American Comic Book Chronicles 1960-1964 by John Wells. TwoMorrows Publishing, 2012, Page 116.\\" Robinson in New York City in 2006 Robinson never saw himself only as a comic-book artist. In the 1950s, he started drawing cover illustrations for Playbill and tried his hand at political sketches, producing what he considered his best work: \\"I did 32 years of political cartoons, one every day for six days a week. That body of work is the one I'm proudest of. While my time on Batman was important and exciting and notable considering the characters that came out of it, it was really just the start of my life.\\" Robinson was president of the National Cartoonists Society from 1967 to 1969 and served a two-year term as president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists starting in 1973. During the mid-1970s, Robinson was a crucial supporter of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in their long struggle with DC Comics to win full recognition and compensation as the creators of Superman. With comics artist and rights advocate Neal Adams, Robinson organized key support around Siegel and Shuster, to whom DC, in December 1975, granted lifetime stipends and a credit in all broadcast and published Superman works.Jones, Gerard. \\"Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters and the Birth of the Comic Book.\\" New York: Basic Books, 2004 In 1978, he founded CartoonArts International, which as of 2010 has more than 550 artists from over 75 countries.New York Times News Service/Syndicate https://www.nytsyn.com/cartoons During 1999, Robinson created an original manga series, Astra, with the help of manga artist Shojin Tanaka and Ken-ichi Oishi.

History  , born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm Sweden, was a chemist, engineer, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the inventor of dynamite. He owned Bofors, a major armaments manufacturer, which he had redirected from its original business as an iron and steel mill. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. Nobel amassed a sizeable personal fortune during his lifetime, thanks mostly to this invention. In 1896 Nobel died of a stroke in his villa in San Remo, Italy where he had lived out the last years of his life.AFP, \\"Alfred Nobel's last will and testament\\" , The Local(5 October 2009): accessed 14 January 2009.

Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and signed at the Swedish- Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895. Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million Swedish kronor, to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.\\"The Will of Alfred Nobel\\", Nobel Foundation. Retrieved 6 November 2007.

Retrieved 12 December 2016. = The Nobel Foundation = Portrait of Alfred Nobel by G√∂sta Florman The Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900 specifically to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. It is based on Nobel's last will and testament. At the time Nobel's will led to much skepticism and criticism and thus it was not until 26 April 1897 that his will was approved by the Storting. Soon thereafter they appointed the members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that was to award the Peace Prize. Shortly after, the other prize-awarding organizations followed; Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June. The next thing the Nobel Foundation did was to try to agree on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900 the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II. In 1905 the Union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved which meant the responsibility for awarding Nobel Prizes was split between the two countries. Norway's Nobel Committee became the awarder of the Peace Prize while Sweden became the awarder of the other prizes. In accordance with Nobel's will, the primary task of the Nobel Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left after him in a fund. Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to represent the Nobel Prize to the outside world and to take charge of informal activities and issues related to the awarding of the Nobel Prizes. The Nobel Foundation is not involved in any way in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates. In many ways the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company in that it invests money in various ways to create a solid funding base for the prize and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953). Since the 1980s the Foundation's investments began to earn more money than previously. At the beginning of the 1980s the award money was 1 million SEK but in 2008 the award money had increased to 10 million SEK. According to the statutes the Foundation should consist of a Board with its seat in Stockholm. It should consist of five men. The Chairman of the board should be appointed by the King in Council. The other four members should be appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. The Board's first task was to choose an executive director from among the board members. A deputy director should be appointed by the King in Council and two deputies for the other members were appointed by the Trustees. However, since 1995 all the members of the board have been chosen by the Trustees and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself. Apart from the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up by the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly, the Swedish Academy and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions and auditors.  Nobel Symposia  In 1965, the Foundation initiated the Nobel Symposia, a program that holds symposia \\"devoted to areas of science where breakthroughs around the world are occurring or deal with other topics of primary cultural or social significance.\\" The symposia has covered topics such as prostaglandins, chemical kinetics, diabetes mellitus, string theory, cosmology, and the Cold War in the 1980s. The Nobel Symposium Committee consists of members from the Nobel Committees in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine; the Prize Committee for Economics; the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation; and the Wallenberg Foundation.  Other Nobel prizes announced by members of the Nobel family  In 2007, the Nobel Charitable Trust, founded by Michael Nobel, Gustaf Nobel, Peter Nobel, and Philip Nobel, announced their plans to establish a new Nobel prize, the Michael Nobel Energy Award, that will award innovations in alternative energy technology. It will be the first new Nobel prize established by the Nobel family since Alfred Nobel established his prizes. However, it will be awarded by the Nobel Charitable Trust and not by the Nobel Foundation, although both are organisations founded by the Nobel family. The plan was announced at nanoTX 07. The Nobel Foundation quickly reacted by threatening legal action for \\"clear misuse of the reputation and goodwill of the Nobel Prize and the associations of integrity and eminence that has been created over time and through the efforts of the Nobel Committees\\".

History and profile It was launched on 4 August 1933 as a four-page, hand-set paper. The paper, whose staff numbered five, including its founder Gebran Tueni, was started with a capital of 50 gold pieces raised from friends, and a circulation of a mere 500 copies. Tueni served as the chief editor of the paper until his death in 1949. His son, Ghassan Tueni, and grandson, also named Gebran Tueni, were subsequent editors and publishers. Ghassan Tueni was publisher and editor-in-chief of the paper from 1948 to 1999 when he retired. On 19 December 1976, Syrian forces occupied the offices of the daily. Upon this incident Ghassan Tueni suspended the publication for a while and left Lebanon for Paris. In 1977, several journalists writing for the daily were detained. Ghassan's son, Gebran Tueni, was the editor-in-chief of the paper from 2003 to 2005. He was elected to parliament for a Beirut constituency in the 2005 elections, but was assassinated on 12 December 2005 in Mkalles near Beirut in a car bomb explosion. A fiery critic of Syria and its hegemony in Lebanese affairs, Gebran had just returned on the eve of his assassination from Paris where he had been living for fear of assassination. After Gebran's assassination on 12 December 2005, his father Ghassan took over the paper again until his death on 8 June 2012. Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal has a stake in the paper. The 2009 Ipsos Stat survey revealed that the paper is the most popular newspaper in Lebanon and one of the five most popular in the Middle East. An-Nahar is the first Arab paper which regularly covers news on environmental issues. Since 1997, the daily contains a daily page for the environment. Views and writers An-Nahar provided a platform for various freethinkers to express their views during the years of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. The paper can be best expressed as centre-left, though its writers' views range across the political spectrum. Journalist Charles Glass argues that An-Nahar is Lebanon's equivalent of The New York Times. Another Lebanese daily, As-Safir, is cited as the rival of An-Nahar. In the mid-1990s the latter was described as a moderate and right-of-center paper, while the former as a left-of-center paper. In the 2000s these papers were again supporters of two opposite poles in Lebanon, in that An-Nahar is a supporter of March 14 alliance, whereas As- Safir supported March 8 alliance. Prominent writers for An-Nahar have included novelist and critic Elias Khoury, who used to edit its weekly cultural supplement Al Mulhaq (which appears on Saturdays) and, until his assassination, historian, journalist and political activist Samir Kassir. Walid Jumblatt worked as a reporter at the daily in the 1980s. Leading caricaturist Pierre Sadek also worked for the daily. Circulation and audience In the mid-1990s, the paper had the highest circulation in Lebanon. However, its circulation in the beginning of the 2000s was 45,000 copies, making it the second after As-Safir. In 2012, the Lebanese Ministry of Information stated that An-Nahar has a circulation of 45,000 copies. The paper's online version was the 13th most visited website for 2010 in the MENA region. In addition to its native readers in Lebanon, the daily is read by officials, intellectuals and activists outside Lebanon. Bans The paper was closed for ten days on 3 May 1961 due to the publication of a cartoon depicting Lebanon as a province of Syria. Syria banned mass circulation of the daily in 2005, while its online edition was not banned. In March 2006, the Damascus correspondent of An-Nahar was charged in Syria with publishing \\"false information harmful to national security\\" after writing about the intelligence services of the country.

They were staunchly Pagan and dedicated to the worship of such deities as Odin and Thor. They reputedly would fight for any lord able to pay their substantial fees and occasionally fought alongside Christian rulers. Although they were Pagan, the institutions of the Jomsvikings in some ways foreshadowed those of the Christian Knightly Orders of the later Middle Ages. The legend of the Jomsvikings appears in some of the Icelandic sagas from the 12th and 13th centuries. According to the sagas (particularly the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga, King Olaf Tryggvasson‚Äôs Saga, and stories found in the Flatey Book), their stronghold Jomsborg was located on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, but the exact location is disputed by modern historians and archeologists. Most scholars locate it on the hill Silberberg, north of the town of Wolin on Wolin island in modern-day Poland. Jomsborg is thought by some researchers to be identical with Jumne, Julin and Vineta, which are mentioned in both Danish and German records from the Middle Ages. Jomsborg (The Polish Review. Vol. 1, No. 1 - Vol. 60, No. 3) by Leon Koczy, Summer 1960Jones, Gwyn (2001) A History of the Vikings 127; Otto Kunkel (1941) Jumne, Vineta, Jomsburg, Julin, Wollin.Johannes Hoops, Herbert Jankuhn, Heinrich Beck, Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde Band 16, 2nd edition, Walter de Gruyter, 2000, pp.120-121, Historians still debate the accuracy of the accounts of the Jomsvikings. Since the site of their headquarters has never been conclusively located, confirming the tales of their exploits is somewhat difficult. The location of Jomsborg is a matter of debate in historical circles, due to the scarcity of primary sources. There are no contemporary sources mentioning the names Jomsvikings and Jomsborg, but there are three contemporary runestones. Reference also appears in Old Norse poetry and Lausav√≠sur which refer to their battles.For the historiocity of the Jomsvikings and the Saga of the Jomsvikings; for a discussion of different views on the subject, see Jones 127 at n.1. Jones regards the Saga as fictional, but finds arguments that the Jomsvikings themselves could not have existed unconvincing. The Jomsviking code The Sj√∂rup Runestone in Sj√∂rup, Sweden, is generally associated with the Jomsviking attack on Uppsala, the Battle of the F√Ωrisvellir. It says:Saxi placed this stone in memory of √Åsbj√∂rn T√≥fi's/T√≥ki's son, his partner. He did not flee at Uppsala, but slaughtered as long as he had a weapon. The Saga of the Jomsvikings relates that the Jomsvikings were highly selective in deciding whom to admit to their order. Membership was restricted to men of proven valor between 18 and 50 (with the exception of a boy named Vagn √Ökesson, who defeated Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson in single combat at the age of 12). In order to gain admission, prospective members were required to prove themselves with a feat of strength, often taking the form of a ritual duel, or holmgang, with a Jomsviking. Once admitted, the Jomsvikings required adherence to a strict code of conduct in order to instill a sense of military discipline among its members. Any violation of these rules could be punished with immediate expulsion from the order. Each Jomsviking was bound to defend his brothers, as well as to avenge their deaths if necessary. He was forbidden to speak ill of his fellows or to quarrel with them. Blood feuds between members were to be mediated by Jomsviking officers. Jomsvikings were forbidden to show fear or to flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength, though orderly retreat in the face of vastly outnumbering forces appears to have been acceptable. All spoils of battle were to be equally distributed among the entire brotherhood. No Jomsviking was permitted to be absent from Jomsborg for more than three days without the permission of the brotherhood. No women or children were allowed within the fortress walls, and none were to be taken captive. It is unclear, however, whether members were forbidden marriage or liaisons with women outside the walls. History There are different accounts for the origins of the order. Gesta Danorum (book 10) tells that a settlement named Julinum was conquered by the King of Denmark, Harald Bluetooth, who gave it to the Swedish prince Styrbj√∂rn the Strong. Harald then provided Styrbj√∂rn with a strong force with which Styrbj√∂rn terrorized the seas. The Kn√Ωtlinga saga agrees by giving Harald as the founder of the Jomsvikings, but the story of Styrbj√∂rn is not connected to the Jomsvikings. The J√≥msv√≠kinga saga says that the settlement was founded by Palnatoke, receiving the location from the mythical Wendish ruler Burislav. Styrbjarnar √æ√°ttr Sv√≠akappa and Eyrbyggja saga agree with all previously mentioned versions by making Styrbj√∂rn take command of the Jomsvikings after they already had been established.Eyrbyggja Saga ¬ß 29 (Palsson 83). Styrbjarnar √æ√°ttr Sv√≠akappa also tells that among the Norse there were many men from the \\"East land\\" arriving at Jomsborg, suggesting that it was a settlement of mixed ethnicity. Jomsviking chieftains included Palnatok, Styrbj√∂rn the Strong, Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson, Thorkell the High, and Hemeng. After the Battle of the F√Ωrisvellir, by M√•rten Eskil Winge (1888) The Battle of Svolder, at which the Jomsvikings fought with Denmark and Sweden against Norway, maybe with a swap of allegiance to side with Forkbeard's advantage, of his 400 ships to Tryggvason's 100. (Otto Sinding painter). Accounts of their size vary. In various sources, Jomsborg was supposed to have held anywhere from 30 to 300 ships in its harbor. However some historians believe Jomsborg was largely a market center with its Danish garrison imposed on the Wends.Gwyn Jones, A History of the Vikings, Oxford University Press, 1973, p. 127 Gesta Danorum (book 10), Styrbjarnar √æ√°ttr Sv√≠akappa and Eyrbyggja saga relate that in the early 980s, the exiled Swedish prince Styrbj√∂rn the Strong brought the Jomsvikings to a devastating defeat against Styrbj√∂rn's uncle King Eric the Victorious at the Battle of the F√Ωrisvellir, Uppsala, in 984 or 985, while trying to take the crown of Sweden by force of arms. The fact that the Jomsvikings lost was attributed to a pact which the Swedish king Eric made with Odin. Three runestones from this time, the H√∂gby Runestone (\\"the brave champion Asmund fell on the Fyrisvellir\\"), one of the H√§llestad Runestones, labelled DR 295 (\\"he did not flee at Uppsala\\"), and the Sj√∂rup Runestone (\\"He did not flee at Uppsala, but slaughtered as long as he had a weapon\\"), relate to deaths with honour at Uppsala, probably three Jomsvikings. The battle is also commemorated, in poetry, by the Icelandic skald √û√≥rvaldr Hjaltason, who took part in the battle on the Swedish side. J√≥msv√≠kinga saga tells that in 986, they attacked Haakon Jarl in Norway and were defeated in the Battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr. The saga recounts that Jomsvikings captured by the Norwegians and about to be executed exhibited courage and defiance, some being eventually spared by their captors. The J√≥msv√≠kinga saga ends with a brief explanation of the battle's aftermath and, in fact, points to this battle as the beginning of the end for the Jomsvikings. After these two decisive defeats, the power of the Jomsvikings waned, but Olaf Trygvasson's Saga relates that they played a decisive, if treacherous, role in the Battle of Svolder in 1000. At Svolder, a Jomsviking force led by Sigvald Jarl abandoned King Olaf of Norway and joined forces with his enemies to annihilate his fleet. This action may have been intended to fight the Christianization of Scandinavia, which had been forcibly promoted by Olaf. As it happened though, the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard, who won the Norwegian throne when the sea battle ended, was (at least nominally) a Christian. He and his father, King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, are reported to have been baptized in 965. Their decline continued over the next few decades. Curmsun Disc - obverse According to the Heimskringla, King Magnus I of Norway decided to put an end to the Jomsviking threat. As part of consolidating his control of Denmark, he sacked Jomsborg, destroyed the fortress and many of the inhabitants were killed in 1043. Curmsun Disc A golden disc bearing the name of Harald Bluetooth and Jomsvikings stronghold seat Jomsborg was re-discovered in Sweden in autumn 2014. The disc, also called the Curmsun Disc, is made of high gold content and has a weight of 25.23 grams. On the obverse there is a Latin inscription and on the reverse there is a Latin cross with four dots surrounded by an octagonal ridge. The inscription reads: \\"+ARALD CVRMSVN+REX AD TANER+SCON+JVMN+CIV ALDIN+\\" and translates as \\"Harald Gormsson king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, diocese of Aldinburg\\".S.

He is a member of the Vachon wrestling family. Professional wrestling career Paul Vachon grew up as one of thirteen children of Ferdinand Vachon, a Montreal police officer. In 1957, he followed his brother Maurice into professional business, adopting his brother's, the \\"Mad Dog\\", vicious heel style and the moniker \\"Butcher Vachon\\". He wrestled in the American Wrestling Association, World Wrestling Federation (now WWE), National Wrestling Alliance and Georgia Championship Wrestling (later would become WCW). He often teamed with his brother \\"Mad Dog\\" Vachon, with whom he won the AWA World Tag Team Championship. In the early 1970s he appeared alongside his sister Vivian Vachon in the motion picture Wrestling Queen. He wrestled under a mask as \\"Spoiler #2\\" for Jim Crockett Promotions' \\"Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling\\" in 1975. His angle involved getting revenge on Wahoo McDaniel, Paul Jones, and Rufus R. Jones for running Super Destroyer (Don Jardine) out of the territory. (In fact, Jardine left JCP on short notice and booker George Scott wanted a masked heel on the roster.) Vachon stayed in JCP for a few months and before leaving lost a series of matches against Paul Jones and Rufus Jones in which the mask was at stake (as was Paul Jones' U.S. title in their matches). Paul retired in 1984. Proving his talents extend beyond the wrestling ring, one of his final appearances was singing La Vie en Rose on Tuesday Night Titans. Personal life He was the adoptive father of wrestler Luna Vachon. He is the brother of wrestlers Maurice and Vivian Vachon and former father-in- law of wrestlers David \\"Gangrel\\" Heath and Tom Nash. In total, Vachon has six children and has been married four times. After his wrestling career, Paul Vachon joined the NDP and ran as a federal candidate in 1988, 1993 and 1995. In 1993, he was diagnosed with colon cancer and had half of his colon removed. Then, in 2003, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Vachon underwent 40 treatments, one on each week day for five straight weeks, to overcome the throat cancer. In addition, he had the disease burned out of his tonsils and his teeth removed. As a result of the radiation treatments, he underwent reconstructive jaw surgery in early June 2009. Vachon also suffers from diabetes. Vachon and his wife Rebecca travel to flea markets and fairs to sell therapeutic magnets, a business they began in 1995. He also self-published an autobiography titled When Wrestling Was Real.

The mountains are on the border between Pitkin County and Gunnison County, Colorado, United States, about southwest of Aspen. Both peaks are fourteeners. Maroon Peak, at , is the 27th highest peak in Colorado. North Maroon Peak, at , is the 50th highest (depending on how they are counted). The view of the Maroon Bells to the southwest from the Maroon Creek valley is very heavily photographed. The peaks are located in the Maroon Bells‚ÄìSnowmass Wilderness of White River National Forest. Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness was one of five areas in Colorado designated as wilderness in the original Wilderness Act of 1964. The Wilderness area surrounds the extremely popular Maroon Bells Scenic Area, which is a major access point for Wilderness travel.  Geology Maroon Lake and Maroon Bells, pre-dawn photo, 19 September 2012. The Maroon Bells are composed of the Maroon Formation - mudstone. Mudstone is weak and fractures readily, giving rise to dangerously loose rock along almost any route. A US Forest Service sign on the access trail warns would-be climbers of \\"downsloping, loose, rotten and unstable\\" rock that \\"kills without warning\\". The mudstone is also responsible for the Bells' distinctive maroon color. The Bells got their \\"deadly\\" reputation in 1965 when eight people died in five separate accidents. Maroon Lake elevation occupies a basin that was sculpted by Ice-Age glaciers and later dammed by a landslide and rockfall debris from the steep slopes above the valley floor.  Recreation  The Maroon Bells are an increasingly popular destination for the day and overnight visitors; around 300,000 people visit the Bells every season. Due to the large volume of visitors, a bus service runs every day from 8am-5pm from mid-June through the first weekend in October. During these times, and with just a few exceptions, personal vehicle access is limited to those with handicap placards or disability license plates. The bus runs from Aspen Highlands to Maroon Lake every 20 minutes. The Maroon Bells scenic area features several hiking trails ranging from short hikes near Maroon Lake to longer overnight backpacking trips into the Maroon-Snowmass Wilderness. Not only is the use of trails and other outdoor recreational space growing, the overall population of Colorado is growing as well. It is expected that 100,000 people will move to Colorado each year for the next two decades. By 2050, the population of Colorado is expected to increase from 5.5 million to 8.5 million, and with this population growth recreational tourism will continue to grow. In 2017, 1 in 4 of Colorado's 86 million visitors spent most of their trip in mountain towns and resorts. This rapid growth poses challenges for Forest Services to properly maintain natural areas, and if changes are not made to how the recreational space is utilized, wilderness areas like the Maroon Bells‚ÄìSnowmass Wilderness trails will feel the impacts of human traffic.  Preservation  Because the Maroon Bells area receives such high levels of visitor use, the USFS has established a long-term plan to protect and preserve the scenic area and larger wilderness areas. Solutions include the required use of bear canisters for backcountry campers, management of day and overnight use, leashed dog education and ticketing, reduction of heavy horse use in high use areas, and prohibiting overnight camping and excessive day use at particular sites. Recently, the US Forest Service (USFS) has come up with a paid permit plan to aid preservation efforts. The permit system was created to allow visitors to stay overnight while mitigating environmental damage and preserving the highly visited area. A permit is required year-round, and limits campers to stay in the Conundrum Creek Valley area from Silver Dollar Pond to Triangle Pass. Campsite limits range from 2 to 6 people, depending on the campsite location. The USFS limits the number of permits to 2 permits per person per calendar year and the maximum stay from June 1- September 1 is 3 nights; the maximum stay for the rest of the year is 7 nights. The Conundrum Hot Springs alone can attract up to 300 people a night. Conundrum Hot Springs Environmental Impacts Specific environmental impacts can occur due to the high number of visitors the Maroon Bells experiences each year. See below for more information. Maroon Bells, two peaks in the Elk Mountains that are less than half-mile apart, are reflected on Maroon Lake =Water pollution= The Maroon Bells Recreation area is surrounded by Maroon Creek, which feeds into Crater Lake and Maroon Lake. These natural freshwater ecosystems fill from snowmelt from the surrounding peaks and precipitation, and are major sources of water for the city of Aspen,CO. According to the study Environmental Impacts of Tourism on Lakes, water pollution can occur through indirect and direct methods. Direct pollution to these natural bodies of water occurs when visitors choose to wade or throw items into these bodies of water, disrupting the fragile biodiversity. An increase in human-traffic,such as the increase in the number of visitors who drive up Maroon Creek Road, is an example of indirect pollution. This constant vehicular traffic releases pollutants such as nitrogen and sulfur dioxide into the water and air. Body of water along West Maroon Creek, facing east-northeast. U.S. Forest Service officials were concerned about the high nitrogen compound levels in the waters at the Maroon Bells in 2003. Officials mentioned that the increase in population and recreation in Colorado as well as an increase in the number of vehicles could be a cause of the elevated nitrogen compound levels, as these sources emit pollutants. When precipitation forms over peaks like the Maroon Bells, these pollutants fall back to the Earth's surface and can travel into the river and lakes, harming fish, insects, and plants, particularly because of high levels of nitrogen. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency further supports the relationship between pollutants and their negative impacts on lakes, streams, and rivers. =Trail erosion= Another impact of overcrowding in the Maroon Bells trail erosion due to the overwhelming number of visitors. High-traffic hiking can lead to negative environmental outcomes such as ‚Äúsoil disruption, loss of native plant species, vegetation, introduction of weeds and pathogens.‚Äù Maroon Bells offers several trails for day-use as well as overnight use; however, many visitors that see the Maroon Bells will make the trek on popular trails surrounding Maroon and Crater Lake. When hikers stray from these highly trafficked trails, they end up establishing ‚Äúsocial trails.‚Äù These hiker-created trails are not designed to be sensitive to the fragile ecosystem, and often further hurt the natural beauty of the area by damaging vegetation. A recent project to \\"rope off\\" sensitive areas to prohibit social trails was implemented in 2018 well.Pictograms-nps-misc-stay on trail =Human waste= With an increase in human traffic on trails and in wilderness areas, human waste has become a serious issue. Areas surrounding Condunrum Hot Springs, the Maroon Bells, and the Maroon-Bells Wilderness area has dealt with visitors not practicing proper human waste disposal. Besides the foul smell, human waste can contaminate local water systems and spread disease. It is necessary to use facilities when available as human waste can contain harmful bacteria that can put populations at risk if exposed to it. For those visitors who go further into the backcountry, taking necessary steps to reduce this contamination is critical. In addition to this report, the book Colorado Recreation Guide, Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests mentions the importance of if an individual must ‚Äúgo in the woods‚Äù to make sure to stay away from vegetation as the acidity in urine can impair plant growth. In an attempt to mitigate some of the human waste concerns, the Forest Service recently implemented a human waste awareness campaign (launched around the same time as the paid permit plan). The awareness campaign included educational information on responsible waste disposal (including how to dig cat holes to dispose human feces) as well as the allocation of free portable toilets, called ‚Äúwag bags,‚Äù for all visitors. The Forest Service announced a decline in improperly disposed human waste since the campaign began; however, it is important to continue these efforts.LeaveNoTrace =Noise pollution= Noise pollution is defined as ‚Äúregular exposure to elevated sound levels that can be adverse in humans and other living organisms‚Äù,and can have negative impacts on the environment and wildlife. With an increased number in visitors,noise pollution has become a concern when visiting the Maroon Bells. According to a study done by the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University in 2017, noise can alter communication between wildlife and insects as well as change their behaviors and patterns.This study also found that noise pollution can disrupt organisms that play a role in pollination as these animals can hear and are impacted by the noise. Human Impacts Studies have shown increased levels of pharmaceutical elements (for example, insect repellant), hormones, and related chemicals in waterways downstream from areas of high backpacker use. Additionally, a 2016 study of water and sediment samples from wilderness areas in Colorado found notable levels of anthropogenic bioactive chemicals, which indicates human sources of contamination. This contamination can become a danger to human health, especially during summer storm season, as water flows into sources that are used for human consumption ‚Äì both within the wilderness area and in downstream communities such as Aspen, CO ‚Äì and agriculture. MAROON LAKE CAMPSITE, 12 MILES NORTH OF ASPEN. SNOW COVERED PEAKS IN BACKGROUND ARE THE 14,000 FOOT MAROON BELLS - NARA - 545714 Campsites set up by backcountry backpackers can also lead to soil compaction and reduced vegetative cover, especially in wilderness areas. Higher erosion levels can occur in the backcountry if backpacker campsites are not properly set-up and taken down. This can cause an increase in water turbidity and some water quality indicators including a strain of E.Coli; further supporting higher erosion level from degraded soils. Time spent in the outdoors, including engaging in activities such as hiking, has been shown to have a positive impact on human health. By being active in the outdoors, people can experience health benefits ranging from increased Vitamin D levels to lower rates of obesity; improvements in mental health, such as reduced levels of depression have also been observed. However, trail overuse and overcrowding can affect these benefits. Indeed, experiential sentiments such as solitude, remoteness, naturalness, and artifactualism are often cited key benefits of time spent in the outdoors. However,overcrowding threatens this positive experience. Some have noted that environmental health and human health are deeply intertwined, and, as such, should be duly protected and sustained. Addressing these Issues Trail education and much needed enforcement of regulations established to protect this popular destination can help address these human and environmental impacts. Below are a few key ways that we can protect Maroon Bells going forward. *Camp in designated campgrounds: While camping is prohibited at many of the high- mountain lakes in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass area, the United States Forestry Service (USFS) has inventoried 700 campsites for recreational use. *Keep out of water: Drinking or going in the lake water is not recommended for the protection of the ecosystem, as well as health reasons. *Clean up Trash: ‚ÄúNo trace left behind‚Äù was an impactful awareness campaign that created a buzz about the importance of cleaning up all trash (varying from human/dog waste to leftover foods or paper goods). *Stay on designated trail:Remaining on the trail keep hikes and backpackers safe from wildlife, and also protects off- trail vegetation. *Reduce Carbon Footprint:Opt to take alternative transportation such as the shuttles provided by the City of Aspen when you visit the Maroon Bells.Maroon Bells Bus - Aspen, Colorado (45114811752) See also List of Colorado fourteeners References External links * Guide to Maroon Bells Colorado * Maroon Bells on 14ers.com * Maroon Bells on Distantpeak.com * Maroon Bells Scenic Area on USFS Category:Mountains of Gunnison County, Colorado Category:Mountains of Pitkin County, Colorado Category:Fourteeners of Colorado Category:North American 4000 m summits Category:White River National Forest ","title":"Maroon Bells"},{"id":"2180865","title":"John Ruddy"},{"id":"2180866","text":"W≈Çadys≈Çaw Galica (born September 20, 1900 in Chicago - September 7, 1943 in Warsaw, Poland) was a Polish Army Colonel.

The asherim were also cult objects related to the worship of Asherah, the consort of either Ba'al or, as inscriptions from Kuntillet ‚ÄòAjrud and Khirbet el-Qom attest, Yahweh,W.G. Dever, \\"Asherah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet  øAjr√ªd\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research,1984; D.N.

Hadley \\"The Khirbet el-Qom Inscription\\", Vetus Testamentum, 1987 and thus objects of contention among competing cults. In translations of the Hebrew Bible that render the Hebrew asherim into English as \\"Asherah poles\\", the insertion of \\"pole\\" begs the question by setting up unwarranted expectations for such a wooden object: \\"we are never told exactly what it was\\", observes John Day. The traditional interpretation of the Biblical text is that the Israelites imported pagan elements such as the Asherah poles from the surrounding Canaanites. In light of archeological finds, however, some modern scholars now theorize that the Israelite folk religion was Canaanite in its inception and always polytheistic; this theory holds that the innovators were the prophets and priests who denounced the Asherah poles.William G. Dever, Did God have a Wife?: Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel, 2005, esp. pp Such theories inspire ongoing debate.Shmuel Ahituv (2006), Did God have a Wife?, Biblical Archaeology Review, Book Review References from the Hebrew Bible Asherim are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the books of Exodus, Deuteronomy, Judges, the Books of Kings, the second Book of Chronicles, and the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Micah. The term often appears as merely ◊ê◊©◊®◊î, (Asherah) referred to as \\"groves\\" in the King James Version, which follows the Septuagint rendering as ·ºÑŒªœÉŒøœÇ, pl. ·ºÑŒªœÉŒ∑ and the Vulgate lucus, and \\"poles\\" in the New Revised Standard Version; no word that may be translated as \\"poles\\" appears in the text. Scholars have indicated, however, that the plural use of the term (English \\"Asherahs\\", translating Hebrew Asherim or Asherot) provides ample evidence that reference is being made to objects of worship rather than a transcendent figure.van der Toorn, Becking, van der Horst (1999), Dictionary of Deities and Demons in The Bible, Second Extensively Revised Edition, pp. 99-105, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, The Hebrew Bible suggests that the poles were made of wood. In the sixth chapter of the Book of Judges, God is recorded as instructing the Israelite judge Gideon to cut down an Asherah pole that was next to an altar to Baal. The wood was to be used for a burnt offering. Deuteronomy 16:21 states that YHWH (rendered as \\"the \\") hated Asherim whether rendered as poles: \\"Do not set up any [wooden] Asherah [pole]Wooden and pole are translators' interpolations in the text, which makes no such characterization of Asherah. beside the altar you build to the your God\\" or as living trees: \\"You shall not plant any tree as an Asherah beside the altar of the Lord your God which you shall make\\".Various translations of Deuteronomy 16.21 compared. That Asherahs were not always living trees is shown in 1 Kings 14:23: \\"their asherim, beside every luxuriant tree\\". However, the record indicates that the Jewish people often departed from this ideal. For example, King Manasseh placed an Asherah pole in the Holy Temple (2 Kings 21:7). King Josiah's reforms in the late 7th century BC included the destruction of many Asherah poles (2 Kings 23:14). Exodus 34:13 states: \\"Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherim [Asherah poles].\\" Asherah poles in biblical archaeology Some biblical archaeologists have suggested that until the 6th century BC the Israelite peoples had household shrines, or at least figurines, of Asherah, which are strikingly common in the archaeological remains. Raphael Patai identified the pillar figurines with Asherah in The Hebrew Goddess.

The song was released as the third single from The Cross of Changes. Overview The song can be regarded as a remixed version of an earlier Enigma song, \\"Carly's Song\\", where the song was originally more laid back and goes at a slower pace. The vocals in the song are whispered by Sandra Cretu. The haunting chant in this song is of Mongolian origin and has a tinge of Gregorian chanting in it. It is from the Mongolian traditional long song, \\"Tosonguyn Oroygoor\\", sung by Dechinzundui Nadmid. For the \\"Enigmatic Club Mix\\", the beat of the song was pushed up a notch and laced generously with beeps of morse code throughout the song. The morse code spells out \\"I love you\\". For the \\"Jam & Spoon Remix\\", the song starts off with a short and relaxing piano piece. Although included in the \\"Age of Loneliness\\" single, it is exactly the same one found in the \\"Carly's Song\\" single. In the music video for the song, the scene is set in New York City and entirely filmed in sepia. People are seen floating through the air weightlessly but remain unseen by the surrounding people. Sleeve The background of the single cover is mostly white (or beige) and has a tarot card placed in the centre. The figure in the card might be seen as a wizard at first glance, but the person is actually a thin Santa Claus conjuring up toys. The number \\"7\\" which appears at the four corners of the card indicates that the song is the seventh track in The Cross of Changes.

The group was originally formed by Cuban exiles in the early 1960s and was most active in the late 1970s and 1980s. Although its base of support has greatly eroded due to the end of the Cold War and the thawing of relations between the United States and Cuba, Alpha 66 is still active today and is recognized as a terrorist organization by state governments and research groups alike. History =Foundation= Alpha 66 was founded by Cuban exiles in the early 1960s to act as an anti- Castro, paramilitary group. Although it has undergone changes in personnel and leadership, it still exists today and is based out of Florida. Alpha 66 was most active during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but remains active in the Miami area. At the height of its power, Alpha 66 operated at a level similar to Abdala, Brigade 2506, Omega 7, and the FLNC (Cuban National Liberation Front) amongst other Cuban-exile paramilitary groups. It claimed to have sixty-three chapters in operation during 1977. Like other paramilitary groups composed of Cuban exiles who emigrated after the fall of the Batista regime, Alpha 66 presented itself as a conservative, ultra-nationalistic, patriotic organization that wished to undo Fidel Castro's revolutionary government. Alpha 66's founding members included many Cubans who had fought as revolutionaries against the Batista government alongside Fidel Castro, and Alpha 66's anthem directly references Fidel Castro as having betrayed the ideals that the group's members originally fought for. Alpha 66's anti- communist rhetoric and staunch opposition to the Cuban government earned it the overwhelming support of the Miami exile community as well as the sympathy of an overtly anti-communist attitude in American politics. Alpha 66 had multiple founders including Eloy Guti√©rrez Menoyo, who had served twenty years in a Cuban prison for counterrevolutionary activities, and Antonio Veciana. Early on, some members of Alpha 66 also partook in the United States-sponsored Volunteer Program, which allowed Cuban exiles to form all-Cuban military units within the United States Army. Additionally, members of Alpha 66 received limited funding and training from the CIA; however, this support did not last. The CIA found that it had little control over the actions of Alpha 66 and, in many cases, Alpha 66 carried out operations without the CIA's approval or consultation, leading to the CIA ending its involvement with the group, which in turn caused many Alpha 66 members to become disillusioned with the United States government for its lack of support. Despite the lack of government support, Alpha 66 still managed to train its members throughout the everglades of Florida. =Evolution= Alpha 66's flag of Free Cuba As hope for a United States-led invasion of Cuba died down amongst exiles, a growing number of Cuban exiles began to promote reconciliation between the United States and Cuba as well as peaceful methods of change within Cuba. In Alpha 66's case, some members broke off and started a group known as Cambio Cubano (Cuban Change). Notably, Gutierrez Menoyo and Antonio Veciana became strong advocates for national dialogue between Cuba and the United States. By 1974, most Cuban exiles figured that the Cuban government could not be overthrown by a militant group and instead decided to support cooperation between the United States and Cuba. The Cuban exiles were labeled ‚Äúdialogueros‚Äù as opposed to the ‚Äúhardliners‚Äù who still wished to overthrow Cuba's communist regime and the Castro government by force. One Miami Herald poll found that only twenty-eight percent of the Cuban exile population in the area supported dialogue between the United States and the Castro government. Although the United States was originally unable to halt Alpha 66's terrorist operations due to issues arising between United States Customs and the Department of Justice, there were other reasons for its lack of action on the issue of Alpha 66. At the time of Alpha 66's founding, the United States was committed to overthrowing Fidel Castro's communist government, which further complicated the efforts of the United States to stop Alpha 66's activities because both actors were momentarily aligned in their goal. However, as time passed, and tensions eased between the United States and Cuba, the United States government began to specifically target paramilitary exile groups and other terrorist cells, making clear its lack of support for the illegal activities that many militants attempted to undertake. By the 1980s, the United States organized special task forces to further crack down on the terrorist activities of groups like Alpha 66. This, and the growing support for the ‚Äúdialogueros‚Äù movement, led most Cuban exile paramilitary organizations to breakup by the mid 1980s. =Contemporary= Although Alpha 66's power began to wane in the early 1980s, it never formally disbanded and still maintains a weak presence in the Southern United States. As late as 1995, Alpha 66 members claimed to be launching \\"drive-by\\" attacks on Cuban tourist beaches. The Miami area is home to some of the last active Alpha 66 cells. There are many Alpha 66 websites in operation today, however; most are old and have not been updated since the 1990s or early 2000s. One such website can be found in the \\"External References\\" section of this page. Alpha 66's doctrine of violent change in Cuba has largely been overturned in favor a peaceful reforms and coexistence between the Cuban government and Cuban exiles. Alpha 66 is an acknowledged terrorist organization and as such has no official sponsor, nor is there an official figurehead for the group. The end of the Cold War, death of Fidel Castro, and warming of relations between the United States and Cuba has made Alpha 66's reason for existing largely nonexistent, especially when paired with the change in popular opinion as to how to bring about change in Cuba. Despite appearing as though Alpha 66 will be on the way out, it has managed to maintain some level of relevance and appears in local news every now and again, but this source of publicity and relevance is also beginning to dry up, leaving Alpha 66 to quietly dissolve like so many other anti-Castro organizations created after 1959.

He was the son of Stu and Helen Hart and the younger brother of Smith, Bruce, Keith and Wayne, as well as older brother of Ellie, Georgia, Bret, Alison, Ross, Diana and Owen Hart. Dean was widely regarded as the most handsome of the Hart brothers. He died at the age of 36 in 1990, from a heart attack induced by kidney failure. Early life He was of Greek descent through his maternal grandmother and Irish through his maternal grandfather. His father was mainly of Scots-Irish descent but also had Scottish and English ancestry. Hart was a dual citizen of Canada and the United States thanks to his mother Helen, who was born in New York. He was nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana has claimed that it was because he was always so busy with working on something, but his brother Bret said in his autobiography that it was because he was always up to some mischievous business. As a child he once accidentally started a fire in the Hart House while playing in the top floor. Amateur wrestling Hart was a good fighter and was the first of his siblings to win an amateur wrestling championship at high school. Career =Professional wrestling= Stampede Wrestling and Amarillo Born to Stu and Helen Hart, Dean Hart began wrestling in his father's Stampede Wrestling promotion along with younger brothers Bret and Owen Hart during the 1970s. Dean was widely regarded as the most handsome of the Stu Hart's sons. He also helped out behind the scenes for Stampede later on but remained mostly preoccupied with other endeavours during the 80s. Hart worked together with his brothers Bret and Bruce in Dory Funk's Amarillo wrestling promotion in Texas during the very early 70s. They were invited to travel to Amarillo due to the fact that they and Funk had become very good friends.http://www.dory-funk.com/hartsho1.html The three of them traveled there alone and Bruce Hart described the journey as something akin to Stand By Me as they ran into several misadventures along the way, including getting chased by people who mistook them for hippies due to their long hair. Dean regularly filled in as a referee for his older brother Wayne when Wayne was sick, Dean portrayed his character as a less traditional sympathetic light than Wayne, being more a competent, strict and fair judge as opposed to a heroic one, to differentiate their characters more as Wayne was Stampede's main \\"babyface\\" referee. On one occasion in 1988, Hart was forced to judge a match alone without a partner as Jurgen Hermann, who was meant to be the main referee of the match, was absent from the show for unknown reasons, and Wayne was out with a knee injury. The match was a Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship match between Chris Benoit and Johnny Smith. Hart ended up accidentally botching the finish of the match, leading to Benoit regaining the title from Smith. This was not meant to happen as Dean was supposed to notice that Benoit's manager had thrown in an object for him to use in the ring to cheat, but Hart did not know this part of the match as he had not been told about it so he failed to disqualify him and Benoit won the title. This resulted in the promotion having to issue a rematch on 6/24 in Calgary. National Wrestling Alliance, Hawaii Hart vacationed many times and lived in Hawaii for lengthy times and befriended many wrestlers there, among them Prince Sui who later worked for his Stampede Wrestling on recommendation from Hart. Hart was also later associated with Lia Maivia and Peter Maivia's Hawaii promotion, which was under the National Wrestling Alliance. While in Hawaii he became close to Maivia's grandson Dwayne Johnson (later known under the ringname The Rock).Stu Hart: Lord of the Ring - p 225 Despite this he remained one of the Hart children with the least involvement with the wrestling business. =Music promoting= Hart began promoting music shows at a very young agehttp://www.1wrestling.com/2010/04/14/ringside-remembrances-the-hart- dynasty/ and held the first ever outdoors concert in Calgary when he was nineteen years old, the event was called Fantasy Park and featured people such as Charlie Rich and comedian Billie Holiday as well as model Barbi Benton as a special guest. Hart regularly promoted music concerts in Clearwater Beach, which was owned by his father. He booked musical acts such as The Doors and Joe Cocker. Some time during the 80s he and his brother Bruce booked the band Iron Butterfly to perform on the beach this proved lead to difficulties when some of the band members got intoxicated. Some of Hart's rock concerts on the beach ended up being mismanaged and did not turn a profit. This led to payment issues and resulted in the area being burned down. Personal life At some point in the early 80s Hart, perhaps unwittingly, got involved in the Samoan mafia, he helped transport some boxes which contained weapons. Later the gangsters threatened Hart's life since they believed that he would testify against them in court when they were facing murder charges. =Family= Hart and his girlfriend Tammy had a daughter named Farrah Hart, born in April 1990. Death He suffered serious injuries in 1978 when struck by a city bus, the accident severely damaged his kidneys. He told his family very little of the accident. Diagnosed with Bright's disease during the late 1980s, he died of a heart attack on November 21, 1990 at the Hart family mansion.https://prowrestling.net/site/2017/11/21/wwe-smackdown-live-houston- correspondents-needed-dot-net-audio-smackdown-dark-main-event-wwe-205-live- brie-nikki-bella-afa-shane-douglas-mad-dog-vachon-dean-hart-cassidy-riley- ryota/ He was cremated. Dean's death had a severe effect on his brother Bret, making him extremely distraught as he felt that they had grown apart too much in their later years. He was unsatisfied with how their last interactions had ended up, leaving him feeling like their relationship never got to recover like he wanted, and that in difference from their younger brother Owen, who died in 1999, affected things between them that could have been said and sorted out, but never were. Bret was also never offered time off by WWF or Vince McMahon, and he wrestled the next day.https://www.f4wonline.com/news/june-29-1998-wrestling-observer-newsletter- steve-austin-out-staph-infection-undertaker-injured https://www.webcitation.org/6wkM7tMJr?url=https://www.f4wonline.com/news/june-29-1998-wrestling- observer-newsletter-steve-austin-out-staph-infection-undertaker-injured Family friend and fellow wrestler Dory Funk Jr. was also very affected, stating that he felt like he had lost one of his own children since their families had always been so close.http://www.dory-funk.com/owen-h.html https://archive.today/20180125170238/http://www.dory-funk.com/owen-h.html Dean was the first of the Hart family to suffer an early death. Dean's death shook the family's feeling of aplomb and the sense of invincibility that they had developed as a tight knit group, semi-isolated from mainstream society outside of the wrestling business. His sister, Diana Hart, stated in her book that had any members of the Hart family been tested as a compatible donor, a kidney transplant might have saved his life. However, this option was never properly discussed by the family. His brother Bret has stated that the family was aware of the possibility of a transplant but that Dean had not been following the doctor‚Äòs instruction about his diet and not done his daily dialysis as he had been told, this resulted in Dean dying unexpectedly at home before he could be taken to the hospital by their father. Legacy His death was the day before the WWF Survivor Series that year, and commentator Roddy Piper stated that Bret dedicated his match to Dean.https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/DotNetDaily/article10029066.shtml https://archive.today/20180125231307/https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/DotNetDaily/article10029066.shtml Bret stated in a 2015 Sports Illustrated interview that the match felt important to him despite him losing it. Hart's older brother Smith named two of his sons (Chad and Matt) Dean in middle name in honour of him. His sister Diana dedicated a chapter in her book Under the Mat, named \\"Dean\\", to him. There is also a tribute video to Hart in his brother Bret's DVD documentary Bret \\"Hit Man\\" Hart: The Best There Is, the Best There Was, the Best There Ever Will Be.

As of December 2018, all former locations have been closed. History Jillian's was founded in 1985 as a billiards club located near Fenway Park in Boston by Stephen Foster. The club was named after a woman named Jillian Foster, who is the spouse of the establishment's founder. The couple later founded the chain Lucky Strike Lanes. Within several years, the owners opened another branch in Seattle. By the early 1990s, it had become a competitor of Dave & Buster's, expanding its locations to include restaurants, video game arcades, bowling alleys, nightclubs, and conference rooms. By 2000, there were roughly 30 locations in the U.S. and one in Montr√©al, Canada. In August 2001, the LA area Jillian's was seen on GSN as Jeffrey Ross hosted in between episode spots for one week during GSN's Let's Make a Deal-a-thon, the week GSN started airing LMAD reruns. In 2004, Jillian's Entertainment Holdings, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and arranged to sell its assets. Nine of the Jillian's locations and the Jillian's tradename were sold to Dave & Buster's. At least some of these locations were eventually converted to operation under the Dave & Buster's name, and some were rebranded as \\"Dave & Buster's Grand Sports Cafe\\". In 2009, D&B;, which itself was going through the process of being sold from one venture capital firm to another, sold the rights to the name to Gemini Investors. That company later established JBC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. to operate these locations. Many of the locations no longer exist: the location at Neonopolis in downtown Las Vegas (which closed in 2008 after also being used as a concert venue) and the location at Peabody Place in Memphis, Tennessee, which shut down in 2009, and the Jillians of Youngstown, Ohio at the Southern Park Mall was closed down on January 30, 2011 but for reasons unknown of the old Woolworth building. The location in Charlotte, North Carolina closed down in February 2010. The Cleveland Heights, Ohio location also closed on February 20, 2011 and was converted into Myxx, a tapas bar, by its owner. The location in Seattle was closed in 2012. The location in Peoria, Illinois closed May 2013. The location in Chesapeake, Virginia was closed July 28, 2014, then reopened as GameWorks on August 1, 2014. On January 6, 2016, Inside Universal reported that the Jillian's Hi-Life Lanes location in Universal City has closed its doors and will be replaced by Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville. In 2017, the Worcester, Massachusetts location closed, and the original Jillian's in Boston was converted into Lucky Strike Social, even though it kept the Jillian's branding. In 2018, the San Francisco Jillian's was converted into Tabletop Tap House, a hipster-styled similar joint.

It is the district capital of Mpwapwa District. According to the 2012 Tanzania National Census, the population of Mpwapwa (Mpwapwa Mjini ward) was 21,337. Overview It is one of the oldest colonial districts in Tanzania, boasting local German colonial government headquarters, or bomas, in the early 1890s, and British administrative offices after World War I. It has long been an important educational town, with the oldest teachers' training college in Tanzania (Mpwapwa TTC) and a secondary school dating back to the turn of the century that was originally called the central primary school. This was the only school for local residents who would form the work force for the colonial administration. The school was renovated during colonial rule to become a secondary school for boys. The school had the first African secondary school headmaster in the country, Mr Matthew Ramadhani, a Zanzibari, who died in an underground (subway) accident in the UK while on a study tour. Mpwapwa had one of the oldest veterinary research institutes in Tanzania, at Kikombo, which was later moved to Temeke in Dar es Salaam in the late 1950s. Mpwapwa was a resting post for the reporter/explorer Henry Morton Stanley, where he is believed to have etched a note (in remembrance of W. L. Farquhar) on a rock that is still present near the Anglican missionary Cathedral (All Saints') at Ving'hawe. The district is populated by the Gogo (ethnic group) ethnic group in the center and north, and the Hehe ethnic group in the south bordering Iringa region. It is located at , with a population of about 40,000 serving an area about the size of Wales. While traditional ways abound with the fabric of society still enriched by a strong embodiment of the predominant Gogo culture, the district is pretty cosmopolitan in its population. Several tribes have made Mpwapwa their home, like the Bena, Nyasa and a few Chaga. The south is populated by the Hehe and the eastern region by the Kaguru. Transport Mpwapwa is a fairly mountainous area and takes many hours to travel by car from north to south along the dirt roads that serve the district. The one-time well-kept main road north from Mpwapwa town to Kongwa eventually links to the tarmac road that connects Dar es Salaam to Dodoma. The central line, the railroad from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma and western Tanzania passes directly through Mpwapwa District, at Gulwe station approximately 12 miles south of Mpwapwa town. On June 24, 2002, the Igandu train disaster occurred along the central line at Igandu station close to Dodoma town when a runaway passenger train with over 1,200 people on board rolled downhill into a stationary goods train, killing 281 people, the worst railroad accident in Tanzanian history; many of the injured were treated at the small district hospital in Mpwapwa town. This hospital was opened in 1964 at the behest of the first member of parliament, Ali Saidi Mtaki. He was instrumental in rebuilding the current downtown shortly before independence. Kongwa, a nearby town, had all the amenities left behind after the failed groundnuts scheme in the late forties and early fifties. During the project, Kongwa had a robust European community with schools and paved roads, the remnants of which can be seen in Kongwa today. After independence, Mtaki managed to bring the main electrical power station to Mpwapwa and the current hospital. The hospital was opened in 1964 by Saidi Maswanya, who was then minister of health.

Sunrise over Mt Hunter Mount Hunter or Begguya is a mountain in Denali National Park in Alaska. It is approximately south of Denali, the highest peak in North America. \\"Begguya\\" means child (of Denali) in the Dena'ina language. Mount Hunter is the third- highest major peak in the Alaska Range. Mount Hunter has a complex structure: it is topped by a large, low-angled glacier plateau, connecting the North (Main) Summit and the South Summit (). Long, corniced ridges extend in various directions; between them are exceptionally steep faces. Naming of the mountain The native name for the mountain is Begguya, meaning \\"Denali's Child\\". Early prospectors referred to the mountain as Mount Roosevelt. In 1903, Robert Dunn, a reporter for the New York Commercial Advertiser, visited the area as part of Frederick Cook's attempt to climb Mount McKinley. He bestowed the name of his aunt Anna Falconnet Hunter (1885‚Äì1941), who financed his trip, on a high nearby mountain, prominent from the northwest. This was, in fact, a different peak, now known as Kahiltna Dome. The name Hunter was mistakenly applied to the present-day Mount Hunter by a government surveyor in 1906.Jonathan Waterman, High Alaska, AAC Press, 1988. In October 2010, the South Summit was named Mount Stevens, after Ted Stevens (1923‚Äì2010), a former senator of Alaska. Climbing history Despite being much lower in elevation than Denali (formerly Mount McKinley), Mount Hunter is a more difficult climb, due to its steep faces and corniced ridges; it also sees far less traffic than its larger neighbor. Fred Beckey, Heinrich Harrer and Henry Meybohm completed the first ascent in 1954, via the long West Ridge; this was a great accomplishment for the time, and used techniques such as extensive front- pointing which were unusual in the climbing world. Beginning in 1977, with Michael Kennedy and George Lowe's climb of a route on the northwest face of Mount Hunter, this steep rock and ice face has been the scene of many landmark hard climbs. =Notable ascents= * 1954 West Ridge - first ascent of peak by Fred Beckey, Heinrich Harrer and Henry Meybohm * 1977 Lowe-Kennedy, on the north face. * 1979 South Spur by John Mallon Waterman (solo, 145 days) * 1981 Moonflower Buttress (Alaska Grade 6: 5.8 A3 AI6 6100') first ascent to last rock band by Mugs Stump and Paul Aubry (NZ). * 1983 Moonflower Buttress to summit, first complete ascent by Todd Bibler and Doug Klewin. *1985 \\"Diamond Arete\\" (Alaska Grade 6) first ascent by Jack Tackle and Jim Donini * 1989 Northwest Face first ascent by Conrad Anker and Seth 'S.T.'

This single is the fourth and last single released from the band's second album, The Cross of Changes. The single cover art is a simplified version of The Cross of Changes. The song employs a more traditional rock format compared to Enigma's hallmark electronica sound. The song contains a sample from A Positive Life's \\"The Calling\\". Michael Cretu provides vocals here. The lyrics of the second verse are the same as the ones of The Cross of Changes' opening track Second Chapter. The video was shot and produced in London; diving equipment supply, supervision and dressing was provided by Michael Last and Jeff Grey. Music video In the music video for the song, helmed by Venezuelan director Angel Gracia (who, in tandem with Cliff Guest, won MTV's Make My Video competition for Madonna's \\"True Blue\\" song in 1986), a diver comes upon an Atlantis-like submerged ancient city (underscored by sound effects resembling a sonar's echo) and takes a tour around the city, similar to the video clip for \\"Sadeness (Part I)\\". Soon he realizes he can breathe without the scaphander, and is attracted by a series of lively murals (paintings or mosaics) combining Pompeii and Byzantine features. Eventually driven to try to make contact with a woman of strange beauty, as their fingertips touch, all the figures come alive resuming what presumably were their last actions. But so does the being responsible for the city's doom - a Poseidon reminiscent of the Sistine Chapel's angry Jehovah - reenacting the catastrophe and the spell. All of the newly liberated beings return to their mural condition. Sadly enough, the spell also befalls the diver - which admits, however, a glimpse of hope: the figures are now in slightly different positions as a consequence of their progress during their brief period of freedom, and the intrepid diver has left his imperishable mark, as a mural in his likeness - the background music featuring, for a last time, the chorus: That's why we are here.

It consists of wrought iron lattice girders on a double row of piers with five spans. The viaduct is approximately six metres above street level and supports two railway tracks. During original planning and construction (in the late 19th century) the project was subject to much opposition and controversy, because the structure blocks the view down river to The Custom House.

He is best known as the drummer for the British rock band Mot√∂rhead from 1991 until the band disbanded in December 2015, due to the death of founder and frontman Lemmy. Dee is currently the drummer for the German rock band Scorpions with whom he became a permanent band member in September 2016. Career =Early life= Dee was born in Gothenburg, Sweden, to a Greek father and a Swedish mother. Also gives date of birth. He began his musical career with local bands Nadir and Geisha. His favourite drummer is Ian Paice. Other influences include Brian Downey, Neil Peart and Steve Smith. Dee also gives credit to Buddy Rich. =King Diamond (1985‚Äì1989)= Having moved to Copenhagen to play with Geisha, in 1985 Dee joined King Diamond who were looking for additional members to complete their line-up. Dee played on the King Diamond recordings Fatal Portrait (1986), Abigail (1987), and \\"Them\\" which followed in 1988. King Diamond himself was becoming quite popular and the musicians backing him were taking a secondary role in the writing and decision making, often Diamond was the only person answering for the whole group in magazine interviews, etc. After the completion of the supporting tour for \\"Them\\", Mikkey Dee decided to leave the band, as he felt he was becoming more of a back-up musician, rather than an equal contributing songwriter. However, he was rehired to play session drums for the recording of the band's follow-up album Conspiracy (1989), after which he was replaced by Snowy Shaw. =Don Dokken (1990)= He joined Don Dokken for his solo album, Up from the Ashes (1990), with the music videos for the songs \\"Stay\\" and \\"Mirror Mirror\\" receiving airplay on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. The band headlined their own tour, as well as opened for Judas Priest. During this time, Dee also filled in a short time playing for World War Three (WWIII). =Mot√∂rhead (1992‚Äì2015)= Dee performs a drum solo While King Diamond was touring with Mot√∂rhead, Lemmy repeatedly asked Dee to join his band. In 1992 Dee accepted, replacing Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor.Lemmy (2002). White Line Fever Simon & Schuster p. 243. . On his replacement of a longstanding member, Dee said in 2006: > Phil Taylor was great when he was good... so I could never have filled that > space. It's like when you get married and have kids; no one can take my > father's place‚Ä¶ I could never be Phil Taylor, so I had to introduce Mikkey > Dee into Mot√∂rhead. Dee's first gig with the band was on 30 August 1992 at Saratoga Performing Arts Center in New York,Burridge, Alan Illustrated Collector's Guide to Motorhead Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing p.62. . but he did not have much input on that year's March or Die as this had been recorded with Tommy Aldridge prior to Dee joining. He played on the albums Hellraiser and Hell on Earth, from the soundtrack for Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth. Although Aldridge recorded most of the drum tracks, Dee's photo appeared on the rear album sleeve. Aldridge said that Dee could take credit for the playing, but Dee declined, as their styles are very different. Dee performing with Mot√∂rhead at Ursynalia Festival 2013, Warsaw, Poland. Epic Records dropped the band after its release and the group continued recording with SPV GmbH. The band also started a label called \\"Mot√∂rhead\\", which was copyrighted and distributed through Warner-Chappell and ZYX, Dee's first album for this label being 1993's Bastards. Dee also played drums on Helloween's 2003 album Rabbit Don't Come Easy, stepping in for Mark Cross. In April 2006 King Diamond reunited with Dee at a sold-out gig at K√•ren in Gothenburg, Sweden. In 2001 King referred to Dee as \\"one of the best [drummers] of all time and that's something that has bothered us since he left.\\" Dee played the drums for Martin \\"E-Type\\" Eriksson in the Swedish pre-qualification to the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, as well as on E-Type's 2003 Eurometal tour. Dee is famous for lengthy drum solos, often lasting between five and fifteen minutes. These appeared halfway through \\"Sacrifice\\", then \\"In the Name of Tragedy\\" and latterly \\"The One to Sing the Blues\\". Dee is an ice hockey fan and a supporter of the Fr√∂lunda HC team from Gothenburg. The rumour that Dee was in a Swedish National Youth Hockey team (stemming from an interview on Mot√∂rhead's Stage Fright DVD) has been rebutted by Dee himself, who attributed it to, \\"In the end of the 80s and a bit into the 90s, I played for a team called Team Sweden in southern California.\\" A contestant on series 1 of K√§ndisdjungeln on TV4 in 2009, Dee was eliminated in the 15th episode. His place was filled on a US tour by Matt Sorum, who said, \\"I thought either Mikkey would die in the jungle or I would die on the Mot√∂rhead tour.\\"Kern, Rob: \\"What's been the highlight of the shows? That I'm still alive!\\"; Classic Rock #138, November 2009, p19 On 29 December 2015, following Lemmy's death a day earlier, Dee announced that Mot√∂rhead had disbanded. =Scorpions (2016‚Äìpresent)= In January 2016, Dee joined Thin Lizzy to play on their anniversary shows. However, on 19 April it was announced that Dee would not be participating. On 28 April 2016, it was announced that Dee would be filling in for James Kottak with the Scorpions on 12 North American headlining dates, including a run of shows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas dubbed \\"Scorpions blacked out in Las Vegas\\". On 12 September 2016, Dee joined the band permanently. Equipment Dee uses Sonor drums, Paiste cymbals, Evans drumheads, and Wincent Drums sticks. He was endorsed by Vic Firth, but recently switched to Wincent, with whom he has his own signature model. He also used Remo heads in the past. His main kit is a Sonor SQ2 Vintage Maple Custom Finish set.

Description It is a low-growing, spreading subshrub reaching tall, with evergreen needle-like leaves long, borne in whorls of four. The flowers are produced in racemes in late winter to early spring, often starting to flower while the plant is still covered in snow; the individual flower is a slender bell-shape, long, dark reddish-pink, rarely white. Names The first published name for the species is Erica herbacea; however, the name E. carnea (published three pages later in the same book) is so widely used, and the earlier name so little used, that a formal proposal to conserve the name E. carnea over E. herbacea was accepted by the International Botanical Congress in 1999. The Latin specific epithet carnea means \\"flesh pink\\". Cultivation and uses right Cultivar series Springwood A close-up of the flower and leaf It is very widely grown as an ornamental plant for its winter flowering; over 100 cultivars have been selected for variation in flower and leaf colour. Unlike most species of Erica, which are typically calcifuges, it tolerates mildly alkaline as well as acidic soils, making it easier to grow in many areas. Like other species within the genus Erica it is often seen as groundcover amongst plantings of dwarf conifers.

The building was located at 455 Central Park West between West 105th and 106th Streets, and built between 1884 and 1886 with additions made between 1889 and 1890; it was designed by Charles Coolidge Haight in the Late Gothic and French Chateau styles ‚Äì inspired by the chateaux of the Loire Valley. It was the first hospital in the United States dedicated specifically for the treatment of cancer, and the second in the world after the London Cancer Hospital. See also: After outgrowing the original building and moving, it became what is today known as Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Around 1955, the hospital became Towers Nursing Home, and the building began its decline. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1976, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and was converted into luxury condominium apartments in 2001-05 designed by Perkins Eastman Architects. Beginning In the summer of 1884, former President Ulysses S. Grant developed throat cancer. He lived in a brownstone at 3 East 66th Street, and his ensuing decline caught the attention of the nation. Considered incurable, as well as contagious and shameful, Grant's death the following year brought awareness of the disease. Although his cancer was inoperable, others were more fortunate, since the development of anesthesia in the mid-19th century had finally given doctors a surgical treatment for cancer. In the year of Grant's diagnosis, John Jacob Astor III, Elizabeth H. Cullum, John E. Parsons, Thomas A. Emmet, Joseph W. Drexel and other prominent New Yorkers laid the cornerstone for the New York Cancer Hospital, the country's first to devote itself exclusively to the care of cancer patients. Designed by Charles C. Haight and completed in 1887, the first portion of the hospital, designated solely for women, was at the southwest corner of 106th and Central Park West. At the dedication, Grant's physician, Fordyce Barker, said that cancer was not due to misery, to poverty, or bad sanitary surroundings, or to ignorance or to bad habits, but a disease afflicting the cultured, the wealthy and the inhabitants of salubrious localities.\\" In 1890 the hospital was expanded south, and in both sections Haight designed circular wards, about in diameter, in part to facilitate better observation by a nurse at a central desk and in part because the design offered more space between the heads of the beds. Ventilation was a key concern, so a duct ran up the centers of the wards to remove what was said to be intense odors caused by the disease. Haight worked the round wards into the exterior architecture, which he executed in deep red brick and soft brown Belleville brownstone, with great conical towers irregularly placed on the three fronts. The big, broad towers gave the hospital the character of a French ch√¢teau, like the Ch√¢teau de Chambord at Chambord, Loir-et-Cher, France, and made it one of the most important pieces of institutional architecture in New York even until today. It is widely said it would much more readily be taken for an art museum than for a hospital. Medical innovation The concept in the 1880s was that germs and dirt in room corners were harboring ground for diseases, prompting the design of its circular wards towers. During the hospital's inauguration, treatment for cancer was mostly palliative. The hospital offered what was considered the best treatments available for that time. Cancer treatment then meant, at best, easing pain and making the sufferer as comfortable as possible. Many patients came to the New York Cancer Hospital, in effect, to die, assuaged by morphine. Other forms of relief included carriage rides in Central Park and Sunday services in the hospital's Chapel of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, patron saint of the suffering. From its beginnings, the NYCH seemed fraught with misfortune. Just months after laying the cornerstone to the new hospital, one of its primary benefactors, Elizabeth Hamilton Cullum, succumbed to uterine cancer. Coincidentally, John Jacob Astor's wife, Charlotte Augusta Astor also died of uterine cancer just a week shy of the hospital's grand opening in December 1887, missing her chance to be presumably cured. Due in part to his generous financial contributions to the facility, the New York Cancer Hospital's first wing was appropriately dedicated the \\"Astor Pavilion\\". Inspired as much by modern medical theory as by 16th-century French ch√¢teaux, the architect Charles Haight's round towers were designed to deter germs and dirt from accumulating in sharp corners, which at the time was considered a harboring ground for disease. An air shaft ran vertically through the center of each tower to prevent air from stagnating in the wards. This design was considered the very latest in 19th-century ventilation technology: The New York Times commented in 1888 that \\"altogether, the[se] features marked a new departure in hospital construction and make this admirable structure a model of its kind.\\" Gray, Christopher (December 28, 2003) \\"Streetscapes/Central Park West Between 105th and 106th Streets; In the 1880s, the Nation's First Cancer Hospital\\" The New York Times The hospital in 1893 The 20th century brought new techniques in cancer treatment, including radiation therapy. In 1921, Marie Curie visited the New York Cancer Hospital, by then renamed the General Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases, to see the brick and steel vault where the hospital kept its four grams of radium‚Äîat the time the largest accumulation in the world. Dr. Edward H. Rogers, who was escorting her, assured The Times that there is no case on record of anyone being injured in health by radium. He denied that Curie had been harmed by the radioactive material, saying she had been ill recently only from anemia. In this period the hazards of radium were beginning to emerge, sparking defensive claims by its proponents. She died in 1934, unsurprisingly due to radium poisoning. In retrospect, early radiation treatments were often worse than the disease they were meant to cure. Radiation caused severe burns and, in some cases, additional cancers. New York Cancer Hospital may have been hailed a success for its good intentions, but there was no end to the suffering of those within. Plagued by the growing death rate, the NYCH had its own crematorium located in the basement of the facility, all the more dreadful by the vision, through its gothic windows, of the tall smokestack to the west of the main building. Largely because cancer remained so deadly, the hospital soon ran into financial troubles. It came to be known as \\"the Bastille,\\" a place to be feared and avoided by patients and patrons. At the turn of the century, administrators of the beleaguered hospital changed its name to the General Memorial Hospital, and again in the early 1920s to the General Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases. Through the decades, the hospital endured its arduous dedication for its principle grounds of finding a cure for cancer. In 1955, the General Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases moved out of the outdated Central Park West facility to its new location on the East Side. There it grew to become what is present day Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. It was during this time that the former New York Cancer Hospital building began its decline. Under the new ownership of nursing home magnate Bernard Bergman, it was turned into a facility called Towers Nursing Home. The nursing home later became infamous for its negligence and lack of standards. The elderly patients testified to \\"atrocious conditions,\\" including inadequate heat, pest infestations, physical abuse and negligence. The patients weren't the only ones being neglected either. The old facilities were unkempt, filthy, and a \\"pungent odor\\" filled the air. The once immaculate building became a sad derelict place. A state and federal investigation ensued following a probe into allegations of Medicaid and tax fraud that ultimately caused the home to close its doors in 1974.Rasenberger, Jim. \\"Shadows on the Wall\\", The New York Times, January 23, 2005. Accessed September 8, 2008. The former New York Cancer Hospital was left in such a disastrous condition following the closure of the nursing home that there were talks of demolition before the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the hospital building a historic landmark in 1976. Redevelopment The building as seen from the east in 2015 The medical hospital, neglected, lay overgrown and vandalized for many decades. In the neighborhood the building become popularly known as \\"the castle\\" due to its gothic round towers. Through the years, many promising developers expressed interest in the decaying property. Among some of them were hotelier and real-estate developer Ian Schrager, best known as part owner of Studio 54, whose attempt to renovate the landmark into luxury apartments failed. The old hospital lay abandoned for nearly three decades until March 2000, when the Chicago-based developer MCL Companies became involved. With generous financing, Daniel E. McLean, president and chief executive of the MCL Companies bought the property for $21 million and began construction. But like numerous predecessors he was forced to halt the work due to financial holdups following the September 11 attacks. McLean envisioned a plan that called for massive renovation of the old hospital remnant into modern luxury condominiums, including a new modern 26-story tower adjacent to the landmark building. Among the new tenants would be Columbia University, who bought several entire floors to use as residence to house senior faculty and visiting dignitaries. The purchase by Columbia, as well as a new construction loan, allowed McLean's project to get back on track after work was halted due to lack of money following 9/11. By early 2005, conversion of the old landmark hospital into condominiums, now called 455 Central Park West, was completed, with units selling for as much as $7 million. The new apartments in the old hospital building highlight its distinct features, most notably cavernous circular rooms with lofty ceilings, while those in the new tower have splendid views overlooking Central Park. Tenants enjoy such amenities as a spa, indoor pool, and 24-hour concierge service.Barbanel, Josh (September 17, 2006) \\"Would an Aardvark Live Here?\\" The New York Times The building was, even then, reputed to be haunted.

In 1994, Bruce Metzger was honoured with the Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies by the British Academy. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Lebanon Valley College, Findlay College, the University of St Andrews, the University of M√ºnster and Potchefstroom University. \\"Metzger's unrivaled knowledge of the relevant languages, ancient and modern; his balanced judgment; and his painstaking attention to detail won him respect across the theological and academic spectrum.\\"James H. Moorhead, Princeton Seminary in American Religion and Culture (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2012): 434. Conservative evangelical scholar Daniel B. Wallace described Metzger as \\"a fine, godly, conservative scholar, although his view of biblical authority is not quite the same as many other evangelicals.\\" Shortly after his 93rd birthday, Metzger died in Princeton, New Jersey, on February 13, 2007. He was survived by his wife Isobel and their two sons, John Mackay Metzger and James Bruce Metzger. Books and commentaries Metzger, Aland, Wikgren, Black Metzger edited and provided commentary for many Bible translations and wrote dozens of books. He was an editor of the United Bible Societies' standard Greek New Testament, the starting point for nearly all recent New Testament translations. In 1952, he became a contributor to the Revised Standard Version (RSV) of the Bible, and was general editor of the Reader's Digest Bible (a condensed version of the RSV) in 1982. From 1977 to 1990, he chaired the Committee on Translators for the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) of the Bible and was \\"largely responsible for ... seeing [the NRSV] through the press.\\" He considered it a privilege to present the NRSV‚Äîwhich includes the books referred to as Apocrypha by Protestants, though Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox consider them deuterocanonical‚Äîto Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Demetrius I of Constantinople. Central to his scholarly contribution to New Testament studies is his trilogy: The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration (1964; 2nd ed., 1968; 3d enlarged ed., 1992); The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission, and Limitations (1977); The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance (1987).James A. Brooks, \\"Bruce Metzger as Textual Critic,\\" Princeton Seminary Bulletin, vol. 15, no. 2, new series (1994), 157. The first volume of a series that he founded and edited, New Testament Tools and Studies, appeared in 1960. Metzger's commentaries often utilize historical criticism and higher criticism, which attempt to explain the literary and historical origins of the Bible and the biblical canon. For instance, Metzger argues that the early church which assembled the New Testament did not consider divine inspiration to be a sufficient criterion for a book to be placed in the canon. Metzger says that the early church saw it as very important that a work describing Jesus' life be written by a follower of or an eyewitness to Jesus, and considered other works such as The Shepherd of Hermas and the Epistles of Clement to be inspired but not canonical.\\"The Fathers ‚Ä¶ did not consider inspiration to be a unique characteristic of canonical writings.\\" Bruce M. Metzger, The Canon of the New Testament (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997), 256, and see 211, n. 6. In discussing the canon, Metzger identifies three criteria ‚Äúfor acceptance of particular writings as sacred, authoritative, and worthy of being read in services of worship‚Ä¶‚Äù, criteria which were ‚Äúgenerally adopted during the course of the second century, and were never modified thereafter‚Äù, namely, orthodoxy (conformity to the rule of faith), apostolicity, and consensus among the churches.Bruce M. Metzger, The New Testament: Its Background, Growth, and Content, 3rd ed., rev. and enlarged (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 317‚Äì8. And see the detailed discussion in Metzger, The Canon of the New Testament (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997), 251‚Äì4. He concludes that, ‚ÄúIn the most basic sense neither individuals nor councils created the canon; instead they came to recognize and acknowledge the self- authenticating quality of these writings, which imposed themselves as canonical upon the church.‚ÄùBruce M. Metzger, The New Testament: Its Background, Growth, and Content, 3rd ed., rev. and enlarged (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 318.

It remains active primarily as an informational depository on the UFO phenomenon. Overview Though NICAP was a non-profit organization, the group faced financial collapse many times in its existence, due in no small part to business ineptitude among the group's directors. Following a wave of nationally publicized UFO incidents in the mid-1960s, NICAP's membership spiked dramatically, and only then did the organization become financially stable. However, following publication of the Condon Report in 1968, NICAP's membership declined sharply, and the organization again fell into long-term financial decline and disarray. Despite these internal troubles, NICAP probably had the most visibility of any civilian American UFO group, and arguably had the most mainstream respectability; Jerome Clark writes that \\"for many middle-class Americans and others interested in UFOs but repelled by ufology‚Äôs fringe aspects, it served as a sober forum for UFO reporting, inquiry, investigation, and speculation\\".Clark, 412 NICAP advocated transparent scientific investigation of UFO sightings and was skeptical of \\"contactee\\" tales involving meetings with space visitors, the alien abduction phenomenon, and the like. The presence of several prominent military officials as members of NICAP brought a further measure of respectability for many observers. Throughout its existence, NICAP argued that there was an organized governmental cover-up of UFO evidence. NICAP also pushed for governmental hearings regarding UFOs, with occasional success. Though any UFO-related group attracts a number of uncritical enthusiasts along with a small percentage of cranks, astronomer J. Allen Hynek cited NICAP and Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) as the two best civilian UFO groups of their time, consisting largely of sober, serious-minded people capable of valuable contributions to the subject.Hynek, 1972 Until the mid-1960s, NICAP gave little attention to close encounters of the third kind (where animated beings are purportedly sighted in relation to a UFO). However, longtime NICAP member Richard H. Hall related privately that this position was \\"tactical and not doctrinaire.\\"Druffel, 93 In other words, NICAP did not necessarily dismiss occupant reports out of hand, but elected to focus on other aspects of the UFO phenomenon which would be perceived by mainstream observers as less outlandish and more believable. The attention given to the contactees of the 1950s such as George Adamski and Truman Bethurum (who typically claimed ongoing contact with benevolent \\"Space Brothers\\") was almost certainly a factor in NICAP's reluctance to study UFO occupant reports too closely. But with the 1964 New Mexico Lonnie Zamora UFO encounter ‚Äî regarded by researchers as one of the most reliable UFO occupant reports ‚Äî NICAP loosened its restrictions on studying UFO occupant reports. History =1950s= NICAP was founded on October 24, 1956, by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown. The board of governors included several prominent men, including Donald Keyhoe, Maj USMC (Ret.), and former chief of the Navy's guided missile program RADM Delmer S. Fahrney USN (Ret.) By early January 1957, however, Brown had proved so financially inept that the board asked him to step down. Fahrney replaced him, then convened a press conference on January 16, 1957, where he announced that UFOs were under intelligent control, but that they were of neither American or Soviet origin. The press conference received major attention, doubtless aided by Fahrney's stature. In April 1957, Fahrney resigned from NICAP, citing personal issues. It was later disclosed that his wife was seriously ill. Fahrney was bothered by the whispers and ridicule his UFO interests generated among many of his peers in the military. Keyhoe became NICAP's director. He established a monthly newsletter, The U.F.O. Investigator. Another prominent figure joined NICAP's board of governors: Keyhoe's Naval Academy classmate VADM Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, USN (Ret.) He had been Director of Central Intelligence and first head of the Central Intelligence Agency. Another important name on the letterhead was that of Gen. Albert Coady Wedemeyer USA (Ret.) (date uncertain) The organization had chapters and local associates scattered throughout the United States. Many of their members were amateurs, but a considerable percentage were professionals, including journalists, military personnel, scientists and physicians. One of NICAP's prime goals was thorough field investigations of UFO reports. They would eventually compile a significant number of case files and field investigations which Clark characterises as \\"often first rate\\".Clark, 413 By 1958, NICAP had grown to over 5000 members. Keyhoe's financial management and business skills were only slightly better than Brown's, and NICAP hobbled along throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, facing collapse on several occasions. For most of his tenure as director, Keyhoe sent irregular letters to NICAP's members, warning of the organization's imminent collapse, and soliciting funds to keep NICAP going. According to Jerome Clark (see sources below), Keyhoe often paid for much of NICAP's operating expenses himself. =1960s= The 1960s found much of the American public keenly interested in UFOs, and NICAP's membership crested at 14,000. This influx of members greatly improved the group's finances. Hillenkoetter left the board in 1962. In 1964, NICAP published The UFO Evidence, edited by Richard H. Hall, a summary of hundreds of unexplained reports studied by NICAP investigators through 1963. Sightings were systematically broken down by witness category and special types of evidence. For example, individual chapters were devoted to sightings by military personnel, pilots and aviation experts, and scientists and engineers. Another chapter was devoted to evidence of intelligent control and yet another to physical evidence or interactions, such as electromagnetic effects, radar tracking, photographs, sound, physiological effects, and so on. Another section examined observed patterns, such as descriptions of shape, color, maneuvers, flight behavior, and concentrations of sightings. The book is still considered an invaluable reference source in the field. When the United States Air Force, in collaboration with the University of Colorado, established the Condon Committee (1966‚Äì68) to study UFOs, NICAP initially aided its investigations, but Keyhoe quickly became disenchanted, limiting NICAP's role. NICAP formally severed ties with the Condon Committee in early 1968. Following the Condon Committee's report (which concluded there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs), public interest in the subject abated, and NICAP's membership dropped to about 5000. 1969 saw the last NICAP efforts of any significance, two monographs: Strange Effects from UFOs and UFOs: A New Look. NICAP's membership plummeted in the late 1960s, and Keyhoe faced charges of financial incompetence and authoritarianism. By 1969, Keyhoe turned his focus away from the military and focused on the CIA as the source of the UFO cover up. By December 1969, NICAP's board, headed by Colonel Joseph Bryan III, forced Keyhoe to retire as NICAP chief. Under Bryan's leadership, NICAP disbanded its local and state affiliate groups .Denzler, p. 17 Afterwards, John L. Acuff became NICAP's director. =1970s= NICAP's membership continued to drop as it was led by Acuff and then Alan Hall. By now, the organization was all but paralyzed by infighting, including unsubstantiated charges that the Central Intelligence Agency had infiltrated NICAP. In fact, several persons with CIA ties had joined NICAP; however, their motives and reasons for joining NICAP have been the subject of some debate. One person specifically named as a suspected CIA infiltrator was retired Air Force Colonel Joseph Bryan III. His son, writer C. D. B. Bryan, dismisses this idea, suggesting that \\"Anyone who knows anything about the history of NICAP knows that the group didn‚Äôt need anybody's help in its disintegration; it simply self-destructed.\\" As to his father's involvement as an alleged CIA agitator, Bryan writes, \\"my father‚Äôs unswerving, outspoken faith in UFOs ... was, I felt, something of an embarrassment ... I do not believe it was the sort of public position an agent would take whose covert goal was to smother interest in UFOs.\\"Bryan, 191fn 1980 saw the last publication of NICAP's newsletter; the organization dissolved later that year. NICAP's archive of UFO sighting case files was subsequently purchased by the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS).

For years, he competed as Mr. X, a masked wrestler while also working as a referee. As a referee, Davis played the role of a crooked referee that showed blatant favoritism toward certain wrestlers, with the storyline that this eventually led to his removal as a referee. He then helped manage The Hart Foundation and began wrestling as \\"Dangerous\\" Danny Davis. He competed at several major WWF events, during which his team won a six-man match at WrestleMania III and advanced to the semi-final round at King of the Ring 1987. He was later reinstated as a referee and remained with the company until the mid-1990s. Career =WWF referee (1981‚Äì1987)= Danny Davis started out in 1981 in the World Wrestling Federation as a referee under his birthname ring name Danny Davis. He also wrestled from 1984 to 1986 as the masked Mr. X, working masked so that the fans did not realize it was a referee in the ring. The Mr. X character was a jobber who won very few matches. He wrestled some of the WWF's top stars, including former WWF Champions Pedro Morales and Bruno Sammartino. He also participated in the 1986 King of the Ring tournament. He was given a bye to the second round but lost his match to Billy Jack Haynes. His biggest win as Mr. X came on the October 28, 1986 episode of WWF Prime Time Wrestling when he defeated fellow jobber Rudy Diamond. Starting in 1986, Davis was involved in a storyline that saw him act biased in some matches and had him involved in several controversial matches in which he was thought to favor the heel (villain) wrestlers. To push the idea that he was a crooked referee Davis would often make fast pinfall counts in the side of heel wrestlers and disqualified face (fan favorite) wrestlers with little or no provocation. WWF commentator Gorilla Monsoon accused Davis of accepting bribes, pointing to Davis' wealth as evidence as a means to make the fans dislike Davis. Davis involved himself in a steel cage match between face Hulk Hogan and heel Paul Orndorff. When both wrestlers escaped the cage at the same time, Davis declared Orndorff the winner, while referee Joey Marella stated that Hogan won. As a result, the match had to be restarted, and Hogan eventually won. By acting as a biased referee many of the fan favorite wrestlers would attack him after the matches, using the attack as a way to give them a measure of revenge on the crooked referee after \\"unfairly\\" losing the matches. Davis would also overreact to wrestlers putting their hands on him, disqualifying them as part of the storyline. Davis also feuded with the Killer Bees (a team composed of Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair) for a while, due to Davis disqualifying Brunzell and Blair in the matches that he refereed. =\\"Dangerous\\" Danny Davis (1987‚Äì1989)= On the January 26, 1987 edition of Superstars (aired February 7, 1987), the Hart Foundation defeated the British Bulldogs to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Danny Davis was the referee for the match and as part of the storyline, he allowed the Hart Foundation to use illegal double-team maneuvers in the match. As a result of the match, WWF president Jack Tunney stripped Davis of his referee duties. That same night, Davis was approached by manager Jimmy Hart about joining his stable of wrestlers. Davis joined up with Jimmy Hart and the Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) and became known as \\"Dangerous\\" Danny Davis. He accompanied the Hart Foundation to the ring for their matches and often became involved by attacking the Hart Foundation's opponents from outside the ring or entering the ring to reverse pinfalls by placing Hart or Neidhart on top of their opponents. At the beginning of his suspension as a referee, Davis was involved in a scripted storyline in which he occasionally came to the ring and insisted that he would referee a match. This led to officials from the state athletic commission removing Davis from ringside. Davis appeared on Piper's Pit, an interview segment hosted by Roddy Piper to discuss his decisions as a referee. Davis refused to admit to any wrongdoing and was confronted by Marella, who criticized him. The segment ended with Piper attacking Davis. At WrestleMania III, Davis made his in-ring debut when he teamed up with the Hart Foundation to defeat the British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) and Tito Santana (Santana's inclusion was explained that Davis had been the referee when Tito had lost the Intercontinental Championship to \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage who had used a foreign object to get the win even though the heel gimmick had not actually started at that time). Davis got the pin on Smith after he hit him in the head with Jimmy Hart's megaphone. His next major appearance was in the 1987 King of the Ring tournament. Davis defeated Tito Santana and Junkyard Dog before being eliminated in the third round by Randy Savage, who went on to win the tournament. During 1987, Davis was booked in several series of matches: against Koko B. Ware, George Steele, and Jake Roberts. The feud with Ware included a match televised on the April 13, 1987 episode of Prime Time Wrestling, which ended in a draw. Ware won most of the matches, but Davis won several matches after using foreign objects to attack Ware. Davis initiated a feud with Steele when Steele was facing Randy Savage in a lumberjack match, which is a match where the ring is surrounded by other wrestlers. Davis, one of the \\"lumberjacks\\" at ringside to ensure that neither competitor could escape, attacked Steele with the timekeeper's bell and helped Savage with the match at Saturday Night's Main Event XI. This feud culminated in a match on the November 28, 1987 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event XIII, in which Steele defeated Davis by disqualification after Davis kicked referee Joey Marella. Davis' feud with Roberts began when Davis showed up unexpectedly on the Snake Pit, Roberts' interview segment, while Roberts was interviewing Mr. T. Davis ran away after Roberts brought out Damien, his pet python. On the September 19, 1987 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Davis attempted to steal Damien during one of Roberts' matches, but Roberts chased him away again. Davis also had a rivalry with Mr. T, who was booked to enforce the rules during matches and thwarted Davis' attempts to interfere. At the inaugural Survivor Series, Davis participated in the opening contest, joining The Honky Tonk Man, Hercules, Ron Bass and Harley Race, facing Randy Savage, Jake Roberts, Ricky Steamboat, Brutus Beefcake and Jim Duggan. Davis was the third man eliminated on his team, after Roberts performed a DDT on him. Roberts and Davis had a singles match the following month on Prime Time Wrestling. Roberts beat Davis quickly, placed Damien on Davis, and left the ring. As Davis' feuds were winding down, he entered into a new feud with Sam Houston. Houston defeated Davis in their first encounter, but Davis was upset because his foot was on the ropes and the referee should not have counted the pinfall. This disagreement led to a series of angry promotional interviews and fights, as well as a series of matches that lasted several months and saw the two trade victories. The following year, he competed in the battle royal main event at Royal Rumble 1988. He was in the ring for the fourth-longest time but was eliminated by eventual winner Jim Duggan when Davis was thrown over the top ring rope to the floor. He also competed in the 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania IV. He was thrown over the top rope by Paul Roma to be eliminated from the match. =WWF referee (1989‚Äì1995)= The \\"Dangerous\\" Danny Davis persona was eventually phased out, and on April 22, 1989, Davis was reinstated as a \\"probationary\\" referee. From this point on, his officiating style became objective, and the crooked referee gimmick was dropped completely. Following his return to refereeing, his highest profile appearance was after a match at WrestleMania IX where Hulk Hogan used a foreign object to attack his opponents in a tag team contest. Davis came to the ring from backstage and disqualified Hogan overturning the victory for Hulk Hogan. He worked for the WWF until 1995. = World Wrestling Alliance (2002‚Äì2010) = Following eleven years of inactivity as a wrestler, Danny Davis made a return to the ring for Jersey All Pro Wrestling on October 26, 2001. On the \\"JAPW Class of 2001\\" event, he was defeated by Mafia (Dan Maff).https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=779 Davis then joined the World Wrestling Alliance in November 2002. On January 10th, 2003 at a WWA card in Norwood, MA Davis defeated Fred Curry Jr. to win the WWA Heavyweight Championship.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=38044 After successfully defending the title against Curry, Josh Daniels, and Kurt Adonis, Davis finally lost the title to Aaron Stevens on May 23, 2003. Danny Davis would continue to appear in the promotion for the remainder of the decade and won their championship on two other occasions.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1403&page;=4 Following the cessation of World Wrestling Stars (the final name for the WWA),https://www.cagematch.net/?id=8&nr;=512 Davis wrestled a handful of times for other promotions. His final match came on September 28, 2013 at the NECW Throwback Throwdown event held by New England Championship Wrestling. There, Danny Davis wrestled Johnny Idol to a time-limit draw.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=101427 =Legacy= Although Davis was not the first person to portray the crooked wrestling referee character, he is often mentioned as a prototype of a corrupt official, which is a storyline that has been used by several wrestling promotions. One year after Davis was banned from referee duties, the twin Hebner brothers (Dave and Earl) were involved in a controversy when Earl took Dave's place and showed favoritism to Andr√© the Giant, helping him to win the WWF Championship. WCW would later use Nick Patrick as a heel referee, who sided with the NWO faction and eventually joined the NWO himself. TNA would use the gimmick with Earl Hebner, who would show favoritism towards Madison Rayne, with whom he was having an implied relationship. In a similar manner, Eric Bischoff and Vince McMahon, the heads of World Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Entertainment, respectively, have used the gimmick of evil owners in storylines. Davis's time as a wrestler and referee led to him appearing in the 1989 line of Classic WWF trading cards. Davis has continued to wrestle occasionally and currently wrestles on the Massachusetts independent wrestling scene. He competed for the World Wrestling Alliance, where he was the WWA Champion. He also occasionally performs as a referee for wrestling matches in Massachusetts. At WWE's WrestleMania XXX event, Davis made his first appearance in the company since 1995, appearing in a backstage segment with WWE legends Sgt. Slaughter, \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase, and Ron Simmons. Davis was wearing a referee shirt in the cameo.

Specifically, it is a quantum field theory in which, unlike most other quantum field theories, the pair of observables is not required to always commute. Theory In many ordinary quantum field theories, constraining one observable to a fixed value results in the uncertainty of the other observable being infinite (c.f. uncertainty principle), and as a consequence there is potentially an infinite amount of information involved. In the situation of the standard position-momentum commutation (where the uncertainty principle is most commonly cited), this implies that a fixed, finite, volume of space has an infinite capacity to store information. However, Bekenstein's bound hints that the information storage capacity ought to be finite. Qubit field theory seeks to resolve this issue by removing the commutation restriction, allowing the capacity to store information to be finite; hence the name qubit, which derives from quantum-bit or quantised-bit. David Deutsch has presented a group of qubit field theories which, despite not requiring commutation of certain observables, still presents the same observable results as ordinary quantum field theory. J. Hruby has presented a supersymmetric extension.

Trichocereus peruvianus), the Peruvian torch cactus, is a fast-growing columnar cactus native to the western slope of the Andes in Peru, between about above sea level. Description The plant is bluish-green in color, with frosted stems, and 6-9 broadly rounded ribs; it has large, white flowers. It can grow up to tall, with stems up to in diameter; it is fully erect to begin with, but later possibly arching over, or even becoming prostrate. Groups of 6-8 honey-colored to brown rigid spines, up to in length, with most about , are located at the nodes, which are evenly spaced along the ribs, up to approximately apart. Taxonomy =Subspecies= Echinopsis peruviana ssp. puquiensis (Rauh & Backeb.)

Mescaline content Echinopsis peruviana is one of a number of Echinopsis species native to the Andes that have been reported to contain the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline. Others include E. pachanoi, E. lageniformis, E. scopulicola, E. santaensis and E. puquiensis. All those columnar species thought to be psychoactive have been called \\"San Pedro\\" in Spanish. Reported concentrations of mescaline vary widely, with causes suggested to include: taxonomic uncertainty leading to difficulties in identification; genetic differences between species and within populations; environmental factors, such as temperature and water availability, affecting plants during growth; and variations in laboratory techniques. Some studies have reported no mescaline content in wild-harvested Peruvian specimens of E. peruviana, and in plants grown in Europe. In those studies that have compared different species and cultivars, when mescaline has been found, it has been at very much lower concentrations than in the highest yielding forms of other species; for example 0.24% of dry weight for E. peruviana KK242 compared to 4.7% for a strain of E. pachanoi on sale in traditional Peruvian shamans' markets, a factor of almost 20 times less.

It is one of the oldest and largest organizations of its kind, claiming more than 4,000 members worldwide with chapters and representatives in more than 43 countries and all 50 states. The organization has been criticized for its focus on pseudoscience, and critics say its investigators fail to use the scientific method. History MUFON, Inc. was originally established as the Midwest UFO Network on 31 May 1969, in Quincy, Illinois, by Allen R. Utke, Walter H. Andrus, Jr., John F. Schuessler, and others. Most of MUFON's early members were associated with the SKYLOOK newsletter of Stover, Missouri and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), formerly of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. MUFON was renamed the Mutual UFO Network in 1973 because of its expansion to other states and internationally. In July 2020, MUFON Executive Director Jan Harzan, who at a 2013 symposium claimed to have been visited as a child by a \\"humming\\" alien, was arrested in Newport Beach, California, on charges of soliciting sex from a law enforcement detective posing as a 13-year-old girl. In response to the arrest, MUFON leadership reported that Harzan had been \\"permanently removed\\" as the organization's Executive Director, and \\"[Harzan] will no longer serve any role in the organization.\\"{{cite news Operation MUFON is currently headquartered in Irvine, California, has chapters in every U.S. state, and claims to have over 4,000 members worldwide. It holds an annual international symposium and publishes the monthly MUFON UFO Journal. In 2015, MUFON founded Mutual UFO Network University, an unaccredited online institution which seeks to train members to investigate UFO sightings. The group claims more than 500 field investigators and specialized teams to investigate possible physical evidence of extraterrestrial craft. The network trains volunteers to interview witnesses, perform research, and draw conclusions from the evidence. Although investigators are not paid, they must pass both an exam based on a 265-page manual, and a background check. MUFON features a newsroom and case management system on its website. Criticism = Pseudoscience = According to science writer Sharon A. Hill, MUFON's focus is \\"decidedly unscientific with talks on alien abduction, conspiracy theories, human-ET hybrids, hypnotic regression, and repressed memories\\", and reflects \\"a wide range of pseudoscience\\". MUFON has been the subject of criticism for drifting away from their original \\"nuts and bolts UFO investigation\\" into \\"bizarre conspiracy and exopolitics talk\\". The organization receives large numbers of UFO reports every year; the qualifications of the amateur volunteers examining the reports, however, have been questioned. Hill wrote that MUFON's idea of scientific researchers \\"appears to be people who are not scientists or propose fantastic, anti- science tales\\". = Officers and donors with far-right viewpoints = An April 2018 article in Newsweek reported evidence of \\"anti-immigrant, anti-trans, and anti-Muslim sentiments\\" among MUFON officials, including MUFON donor J. Z. Knight and former MUFON State Director for Pennsylvania John Ventre, both of whom have publicly expressed racist and/or anti-Semitic views, and are described in the article as \\"high-tier Inner Circle donors to MUFON\\". The expressed far-right viewpoints \\"kicked off a wave of anger and resignations across MUFON\\", including former MUFON Director of Research Chris Cogswell (who stated, \\"My internal conscience would not let me continue\\") and former board member and Washington State Director James Clarkson (who stated, \\"Remaining in MUFON in any capacity is morally unacceptable.\\") Erica Lukes, former MUFON State Director for Utah, is also reported in the article as describing MUFON as \\"an organization unwilling to adequately address sexual harassment\\". In 2020, Vice magazine reported that Ken Pfeifer, head of MUFON's Rhode Island chapter, posted racist memes and comments on Facebook during the height of national Black Lives Matter protests.

The name is still used in New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and within the UK in Northern Ireland. Recent legal developments in Great Britain include the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, which has renamed these societies as co-operative or community benefit societies. From 1 August 2014 a new society has had to register as either a co-operative or a community benefit society rather than, as was the case previously, a society that meets either requirement. Societies already registered before that date remain registered under the 2014 Act and under ss 1 & 2 of the 2014 Act all three types of society ‚Äì co-operative societies, community benefit societies, and societies already registered before 1 August 2014 ‚Äì are referred to together as \\"registered societies\\".http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/14/section/1 However, for administrative purposes the three types of society are categorised separately. The Act applies to Great Britain but not Northern Ireland. Categories See Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 for information about the current law on these societies. History 1965 to 2014 In 1965, an act of Parliament came into effect called the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965. In 2006, the Friendly and Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1968 (Audit Exemption) (Amendment) Order 2006Statutory Instrument 2006 No. 265 increased the audit exemption threshold level for industrial and provident societies to ¬£5.6 million. Also the Charities Act 2006 removed certain exemptions of charitable IPSs in England and Wales. From that point, charitable IPSs had to register with both the FCA and the Charity Commission, except registered social landlords, who register with the Tenant Services Authority. Since 2010 the IPS laws explicitly name co-operatives in their titles. The 'Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965' was renamed 'Co- operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 1965'. In 2011, the Legislative Reform (Industrial and Provident Societies and Credit Unions) Order 2011Statutory Instrument 2011 No. 2687 increased the maximum shareholding limit, changed the date of submission of the annual return, permitted children to be members, and allows the publication of unaudited interim accounts. In January 2012, the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron announced a project to consolidate all the legislation applicable to industrial and provident societies to be passed by 2015. There was some uncertainty as to how far new developments would address the problems with the legislation. Cameron stated, \\"We know that breaking monopolies, encouraging choice, opening up new forms of enterprise is not just right for business but the best way of improving public services too.\\" Ed Mayo, Secretary General of Co-operatives UK, welcomed the project. In mid-2012, revision of laws for co- operative was in its early stages. Some felt the reforms did not deal with certain key problems. Changes to the registration system under the Financial Services Act 2012 which splits the Financial Services Authority into the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) took effect on 1 April 2013. The registration function for societies was transferred to the FCA while the prudential regulation of credit unions was transferred to the PRA. In September 2013, the English and Scottish Law Commissions published a draft consolidation bill and related documents for consultation. Earlier that year, the UK Treasury, which is the department responsible for legislation for societies, published a series of proposals to increase the holding limit for withdrawable share capital in societies to at least ¬£31,000, to apply insolvency rescue procedures to societies, and to change the rules applicable to their registers of members. Draft regulations linked to that consultation were also available, having been circulated to a small number of people. Those drafts and other materials, including a private member's bill to liberalise the use of share capital by societies presented to the UK House of Lords were explained and brought together online. In 2014, the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 was given royal assent. Regulation IPSs were registered (but not regulated) by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which took over the job from the Registrar of Friendly Societies when it was part of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) (both being supervised by the Treasury). Note that IPS registration is quite separate from the FCA's function of regulating financial institutions. Such businesses have been controlled in the past by the Industrial and Provident Societies Partnership Act 1852, the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893, and the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965. The legislation in the Republic of Ireland is based on modifications of the UK Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893. =Legislation= * Industrial and Provident Societies Partnership Act 1852 * Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 * Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act 1913 * Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 1965http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber;=62&NavFrom;=2&activeTextDocId;=1233768 * Industrial and Provident Societies Act 2002http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/ukpga_20020020_en_1 * Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2003http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030015_en_1 * Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 2010 * Financial Services Act 2012 * Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 Forms of financial capital Unlike a company limited by guarantee, an IPS generally has a share capital. However, in a not-for-profit IPS the share capital may be limited to a nominal amount. Both types of IPS have a share capital, but it is usually not made up of equity shares like those in a company limited by shares, which appreciate or fall in value with the success of the enterprise that issues them. Rather they are par-value shares, which can only be redeemed (if at all) at face value. The profits and losses of an IPS are thus the common property of the members. The share typically acts as a \\"membership ticket\\", and voting is on a \\"one member one vote\\" basis. The maximum individual withdrawable shareholding is currently set at ¬£100,000 (although other IPSs may hold more shares than this). The Legislative Reform Order (Industrial & Provident Societies and Credit Unions) Order 2011 removed the limit for non-withdrawable shares. Since 2006, the FSA has been willing, in principle, to permit societies to have non-user investor members providing certain conditions are met and this, in combination with the removal of the ¬£100,000 holding limit for non-withdrawable shares, may open up wider possibilities for co-operatives to raise finance from investors while maintaining user control. It may be withdrawable share capital, an unusual form of finance which is treated as equity but may be withdrawn subject to specified conditions, and is relatively cheap for small co-operatives to raise as it is exempt from certain regulations applicable to conventional share issues regarding the publication of a prospectus. However, an IPS with withdrawable share capital is not allowed to carry on a banking business, presumably because a withdrawable share capital would make it impractical to ensure capital adequacy requirements are continuously met.

The convent was founded in 1908 by Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna (sister of Alexandra Feodorovna, the last Empress of Russia‚Äîboth of whom are counted among the Russian New Martyrs) to assist sick, wounded, and maimed soldiers in their recovery, and to provide for the needs of the poor and orphans. History Grand Duchess Elizabeth was the widow of Grand Duke Sergeii Alexandrovich, who had been assassinated by terrorists in 1905. After her husband's death, she gave away her magnificent collection of jewels, including her wedding ring, and sold her other possessions. With the proceeds, she opened the Convent of SS Martha and Mary and became its abbess. Her vision was to begin a religious community, made up of women from all social strata, that would merge the ideals of saints Martha and Mary, dedicated both to prayer and to serving the needs of the poor. She purchased a tract of land in Moscow and constructed a hospital, an orphanage for girls, and quarters for the nuns. Working in conjunction with church authorities she developed the monastic rule and habit‚Äîwhich differed somewhat from the traditional habit of Orthodox nuns‚Äîthat would be used at the convent. At its peak, the convent housed 97 sisters and served 300 meals daily to the poor. Grand Duchess Elizabeth wearing the monastic habit she designed for the convent. From 1908‚Äì12, Alexey Shchusev designed the Church of Saints Martha and Mary and the Holy Protection Cathedral, both structures being Russian Revival and Art Nouveau renderings of a medieval Novgorod architectural type. The cathedral's snow-white walls are adorned with carved crosses by Sergey Konenkov. The interior contains frescoes and mosaics by Mikhail Nesterov and Pavel Korin. Life within the convent The sisters woke at 6:00 a.m. and organized their rooms. At 7:30 they gathered in the hospital chapel for a common rule of prayer followed by the reading of a gospel, an epistle, a psalm, and perhaps a brief sermon by the priest serving that day. The sisters departed from the chapel after receiving a blessing from the priest and greeting the mother superior. They then gathered for some tea before going to their daily obediences. Those who were not immediately needed at their obedience remained in the chapel for the Divine Liturgy. Sisters were responsible for the reading and chanting in both churches. The chant was generally of a simple monastic style, with concert singing very seldom used. The choir members also did handiwork in the community workshop, where all the clothing of the sisters was made. Following morning prayers, the sisters would be found at their various obediences: some in the hospital awaiting the doctors making rounds, others in the clinic to provide treatment such as massages, injections, etc., for the ailing, others in the school, and yet others in the kitchen or other areas of the house. Twice a week between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. the spiritual father offered the sisters a lecture, one week on the catechism, and the following week one on the holy fathers. The sisters prepared for Holy Communion at least four times a year during the major fasts, though they were allowed to receive more often if they wished. At 12:30 lunch was served with the reading of the life of the saint of the day during the meal. Meals were prepared in accordance with church fasting rules. Tea was served at 4:00 p.m. followed by vespers and matins at 5:00 p.m. Sisters who have completed their obediences were present at these services. Before feast days and Sundays, all-night vigils were held. At 7:30 p.m. dinner was served. There was common evening prayer at 9:00 p.m. in the hospital chapel. The sisters retired to their cells following prayer, receiving a blessing from the superior as they departed. By 10:30 p.m. all prepare for sleep, and by 11:00 p.m. there was quiet and all lights were extinguished. Spiritual life For their spiritual strengthening and edification the sisters visited with the Abbess or spiritual father at appointed times. Four times a week an akathist hymn was read during the evening prayer rule: on Sundays, to the Savior; Mondays, to Archangel Michael and all the Heavenly Hosts; Wednesdays, to Sts. Martha and Mary; and Fridays, to the Mother of God or the Passion of Christ. The sisters were also obliged to attend Vigil and Liturgy at the Chudov Monastery on the feast days of the holy hierarch St. Alexis of Moscow, February 12 and May 20. A pilgrimage was also made to the sepulchre church of the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich on February 4, the day of his repose. Habit of the convent The Holy Mandylion icon over the main door. The sisters wore white cotton robes on Sundays and feast days. The work uniform was a grey cotton robe cut like a cassock, sewn together in front and closed on the sides. with white cuffs on the sleeves. The head covering of tonsured members was a white apostolnik cut in the monastic style with a grey woolen veil. Those tonsured also wore a cross made of cypress wood around their necks on a white string. The icons of Christ-Not-Made-By-Hands and the Protection of the Mother of God are on one side of the cross; the other side holds an icon of Sts. Martha and Mary and the inscription: Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all your soul, and all thy mind, and all thy strength; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Sisters received this cross at their tonsure into the sisterhood, giving a vow to devote this specific period of their lives to God and neighbor, and to abide by the rules of the community. All sisters were given a prayer rope upon entering the community with the obligation to recite the Jesus Prayer 100 times daily. Postulants did not wear the prayer rope externally, but those tonsured wore the prayer rope they received a second time at their tonsure on their left hand. Postulants wore a long white kerchief on their heads, which covered their foreheads completely. On Sundays and feast days the sisters wore white robes. The postulants wore gray robes. Charitable works A primary obligation of the sisters was to visit the poor. A few sisters were sent out daily in pairs to visit assigned areas of the city. The Grand Duchess received over twelve thousand petitions annually. A portion of these were reviewed by the sisters, processed along with the numerous other requests and information about the poor received from other sources. Closure The elaborate stone tracery In 1920, the convent was forced by the Soviet authorities to provide a comprehensive listing of the Order‚Äôs properties, both moveable and immoveable. This document has all information concerning not only the Cathedral of the Holy Protection, but the lower church of the Archangel Michael and All the Bodiless Powers, the hospital Church of Sts. Martha and Mary, the funerary chapel, and the psaltery. This extraordinary catalogue and several which were later published provide a complete enumeration of the liturgical objects, icons, artworks, valuables, and their placement. Despite the anti-religious sentiment, it was well understood that the convent and its churches represented a rare gesamtkunstwerk (complete work of art), and that its synergy of architecture, decoration, and collections of fine and decorative art were exceedingly important. By 1922, however, the government began to order a systematic nationalization and confiscation of the convent's property, beginning to remove valuable gold and silver objects such as ikon oklads, rizas, gospel covers, crosses and ecclesiastical and liturgical objects. In 1923, the convent tried to remake itself as the ‚ÄúMartha and Mary Community of Industry‚Äù in order to continue their works despite the civil war and official atheist position of the government. By 1925, the convent was being attacked for its makeup of former aristocrats and bourgeoises, and soon, the organization was under strain. In 1926, the Church of SS Martha & Mary was closed, though the remaining nuns were able to remove over 200 icons and the ‚Äúroyal doors‚Äù from the cathedral by moving them to the Church of the Holy Protection. Shortly after this, the order was officially disbanded, and eighteen of the remaining nuns were exiled to Turkestan in Central Asia. In 1928, both churches were finally closed, looted, pillaged, and desecrated. The frescos by Nesterov were covered and the church was turned into a movie theater. From 1945, the church was used by the Grabar Institute as an icon and painting restoration studio. Restoration of the order and convent complex Veneration of the Grand Duchess as a Saint and New Martyr had begun outside of Russia soon after her interment at Jerusalem, and her memory was honored secretly within the Soviet Union. With the collapse of communism, official attitudes changed. Elizabeth had already been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1981, but in 1990 a monument was erected on the convent grounds, and in 1992, the Grand Duchess was glorified (canonized) by the Russian Orthodox Church (see Romanov sainthood). Later that year, the celebration of divine services was resumed in the Church of Martha and Mary, and in 1994 the sisterhood was re-established. In 1999 the Educational Center of the SS Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy was founded, with the blessings of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and All Russia, for the purpose of training Orthodox girls as certified nurses. File:Mikhail Nesterov 058.jpg File:Mikhail Nesterov 058b.jpg File:Mikhail Nesterov 059.jpg File:Mikhail Nesterov 060.jpg Royal British, Greek, and Danish connections to the convent As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Grand Duchess Elizabeth is closely related to the Greek, Danish, and British Royal families. Elizabeth's older sister was Victoria, Marchioness of Milford-Haven, whose daughter Alice married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark. Princess Alice became the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and later founded a nursing order of Greek Orthodox nuns, the \\"Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary\\". This was modelled on the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent that her aunt had founded in Russia, but the order eventually failed for want of suitable applicants. Princess Alice was buried near Grand Duchess Elizabeth in the Russian Orthodox Church of Mary Magdalen on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. In 2002, HRH Prince Charles commissioned the British composer and convert to the Russian Orthodox Church, John Tavener, to write a choral piece in memory of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. The work was entitled \\"Elizabeth Full of Grace\\" and celebrates the life, death and glorification of Saint Elizabeth the Grand Duchess. It was premiered at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 28 February 2003 by Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky Chorus and Orchestra. Proceeds from the performance went to benefit the charitable work of the Saints Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy.

Description Existensminimum (Swedish for \\"Minimum Subsistence\\", the minimum income considered necessary for a reasonable standard of living) is a game where players take on the role of economically disadvantaged people trying to survive. The game was designed by Ann-Sofie Persson, a single mother of five, and two friends, Anna and David Lindmark. Persson found that many board games where players accumulate wealth were unrealistic, saying \\"I wanted to buy a fun game, but they were all about becoming a millionaire. They had nothing to do with my life.\\" She decided to create a game closer to her own experiences. Existensminimum simulates the struggles of those who live close to the poverty line. The object of the game is not to accumulate extreme wealth but rather to \\"survive\\" and perhaps save enough to gain a car, an education and other basic needs. Rather than buying and selling thousands of shares, players earn minimal income from social welfare, unemployment insurance, blueberry picking and temporary employment in nursing homes. At the Nolia Trade Fair in 2003, the game was nominated for Best Innovation, but when Persson approached large game companies about publishing it, none expressed interest due to the game's downbeat theme. Instead, Persson and the Lindblats self-published 530 copies, and ordered a second print run when the first sold out. In 2020, V√§sterbottens Mellanbygd called the game an \\"anonymous cult classic\\" that had seen a resurgence of interest due to economic hardships brought on by the COVID pandemic.

Allen, The UFO Experience: A scientific enquiry. (1972) Although Hynek started out as a skeptic and helped the Air Force to debunk most UFO reports, he gradually became convinced that a small number of UFO cases were not hoaxes or explainable as misidentifications of natural phenomena, and that these cases might represent something extraordinary ‚Äî even alien visitation from other planets.(Clark, p. 530) When the Air Force shut down Project Blue Book in 1969, Hynek, in 1973, founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) to continue to collect and study UFO reports. Ufologist James W. Moseley wrote that CUFOS was \\"... the first real attempt to set up a private research group genuinely dedicated to scientific investigations and study of UFOs.\\"(Moseley, p. 228) Moseley observed that CUFOS \\"wasn't a saucer club and, for a while, wasn't open to general membership.

The Chrysalis Group were the original owners of Chrysalis Records, which they sold to EMI. In 2005, The Echo Label recorded a loss of over ¬£2.0 million. The decision was taken to restructure the business at the beginning of the 2006 financial year, into an \\"incubator\\" for developing writer-artists with the intention of \\"upstreaming\\" them to a major label. The signings which resulted from this included Bat for Lashes, Steven Lindsay, Rosalie Deighton, Jacob Golden and Sarabeth Tucek. They would continue to release records for their established artists Feeder and Morcheeba. However, in a Chrysalis Group report dated 15 August 2008, it was stated that The Echo Label had performed below management's expectations and had not upstreamed any artists in this period, other than Bat For Lashes, who were transferred to Parlophone in early 2007.

There are 38 Kangean Islands (Indonesian: Kepulauan Kangean) altogether with 6 inhabited, forming an archipelago that is part of Indonesia covering a total space of 668 square km. They are located in the Java Sea approximately north of Bali and 120 km east of Madura Island. The islands are administratively a part of Sumenep Regency within East Java province. Layout The largest island, at about 490 km¬≤, is Kangean Island. Other islands include Paliat, Sepanjang, and several smaller islands. The towns of Arjasa and Kalikatak, both on Kangean Island, are the area's largest population centres. The Kangean islands have strong historic and ethnic ties with Madura, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, Sumbawa, South Borneo, and also South Sulawesi. The majority religion at Kangean is Islam. The highest elevation point on the islands is in the northeast at 1,192 feet (364 m.), while overall the islands are low in elevation. The weather tends to rain regularly. West coast of Kangean Island Saltwater crocodiles are reported to be present within the island's coastal mangroves. They are administered as three districts (kecamatan) of Sumenep Regency - Arjasa, Kangayan, and Sap√™ken.

The natural gas fields were first discovered and developed by the United States corporation ARCO, which became a subsidiary of BP in 2000. In mid-2004, BP sold its Kangean holdings to an Indonesian corporation, PT Energi Mega Persada. The islands are connected to East Java via a 430 km pipeline, most of which runs underwater. Other economic activities on the islands include teak, coconut, and salt production. Airstrip In 2014, the local government agreed to reactivate an old airstrip on Kangean Island.

He played as a left back or left-sided midfielder. Club career =Early career= Born in Conakry, Guinea, Camara spent the early years of his professional career in French football, with Beauvais in 1993, and in 1996 went on loan to Troyes, where he played 13 league games. He made a total of 79 league appearances for Beauvais, before signing for Le Havre in August 1997, where he was sent on loan to Lille. =Wolves= Camara moved to England in summer 2000 with Wolverhampton Wanderers of the First Division in a ¬£100,000 deal. He became a cult figure amongst their fans, known for his commitment and pace despite sometimes exhibiting a lack of positional sense and ball control. A regular column from the spoof 'Mohammed Camara Appreciation Society' appeared in fanzine 'A Load of Bull' celebrating his eccentric but lovable playing style. He was a regular starter in his first two seasons with the side, but failed to make an appearance during their 2002‚Äì03 promotion success following the signing of Denis Irwin and a knee ligament injury. =Burnley= Camara joined Burnley on a free transfer in June 2003, which gave Camara regular playing time once again. After Steve Cotterill replaced previous manager Stan Ternent, he made the left-back focus on his crossing ability, causing a dramatic up-turn in his form at the beginning of the 2004‚Äì05 season. He scored once for Burnley in the League Cup as they memorably knocked out Premier League side Aston Villa in October 2004. =Celtic= Camara's form attracted interest from Scottish Premier League side Celtic, who he joined at the end of his two-year contract under the Bosman ruling at the end of the season. After one-to-one sessions with manager Gordon Strachan, Camara started to do well and established himself as a defender in Celtic's first eleven. However, after Ross Wallace was converted into a left-back, Camara was relegated to the bench and made only rare appearances. He fell further down the pecking order after the signing of right-back Mark Wilson, who was also converted to left back. =Derby County= Despite earlier pledging to fight for his place at Celtic, Camara ending up leaving to join Derby County on a free transfer in August 2006. He was a regular player during the first half of the season, however he found himself out of contention after Derby signed Jay McEveley in the January transfer window. The following season, with the club newly in the Premier League, saw Camara find appearances just as scarce. Despite scoring against Blackpool in the League Cup at the start of the season, he made just one appearance in the top flight, a 0‚Äì6 thrashing at Liverpool, before later being loaned to Championship side Norwich City. This was subsequently extended to cover the whole of the 2007/08 campaign. On 5 August 2008, Camara moved to Derby's Championship rivals Blackpool on loan until 30 August. He made his debut for the Seasiders on 9 August in a 1‚Äì0 home defeat to Bristol City. On 9 September the loan was extended for a further month, with manager Simon Grayson saying, \\"He has done very well for us in the first four league games. He has good energy and experience and he has been a good addition.\\" The loan period was extended for a third and final time on 17 October, keeping him with the Seasiders until 22 November. . Upon his return to Derby Camara featured in a FA Cup victory at Forest Green Rovers but was deemed surplus to requirements by new Derby manager Nigel Clough and his contract was cancelled on 2 February 2009. =St Mirren= After the January 2009 transfer window shut, free agent Camara moved back to Scotland to sign for Scottish Premier League side St Mirren. =Torquay United= Soon after being released from St Mirren, Camara joined English League Two side Torquay United. Having made his debut in a 2‚Äì1 home defeat to Port Vale on 13 February, Camara made his second and final appearance for the Gulls six days later in a match at Rotherham United in which he was substituted at half time. It was finally confirmed by manager Paul Buckle on 24 April that Camara was no longer at the club. He was released by Torquay on 15 May 2010, along with six other players. International career After football Camara was made head of European scouting at Derby County in February 2014 and opened a wine bar in Tettenhall, an affluent area of Wolverhampton in 2017.

In 2007, Lapham expressed interest in completing both projects. 2009 saw the release of Dark Horse: Noir, which included a Stray Bullets story that took place within the still incomplete arc. In March 2010, it was reported that Lapham was working on a Predator series for Dark Horse Comics.Dark Horse Prepping Predators Prequel and Sequel In March 2014, the long-awaited forty-first and final issue of the initial Stray Bullets arc and series as whole was released after the Laphams made a deal with Image Comics. On the same day, an omnibus edition of all forty-one issues was released, as well as the first issue of a new series titled Stray Bullets: Killers. At Image, Lapham has continued Stray Bullets as a series of story arcs separated into their own miniseries: Stray Bullets: Killers ran for eight issues, followed after a brief hiatus by a second arc: Stray Bullets: Sunshine & Roses ran for forty-two issues.

Production at a site in France was expected to take advantage of US industrial capacity to produce the automotive elements, with the UK producing the armoured hulls and armament. The planned production levels would have equipped the Allied armies with a very large tank force that would have broken through the German defensive positions in the planned offensive for 1919. In practice, manufacture was slow and only a few vehicles were produced before the end of the war in November 1918. After the war, 100 vehicles assembled in the US were used by the US Army until more advanced designs replaced them in 1932. A few tanks that had not been scrapped by the start of World War II were provided to Canada for training purposes. Early development As the First World War progressed, the industrial production capacity of the Entente was taxed to the limit. Of the Allies, only Great Britain and France had been major industrial nations in 1914 and the latter had lost 70% of its heavy industry when the Germans overran that part of Lorraine that they had not already occupied in 1871. The output in Britain was limited by labour shortages due to the manpower demand of the armed forces and a rocketing national debt. When the United States of America declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, many in Britain hoped this event would solve all these problems. The two men directly responsible for British tank production, Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt and Lieutenant-Colonel Albert Gerald Stern, initially considered sending a delegation to the United States immediately, to convince the new ally to start production of a British tank design. After some reflection they decided it was best to leave the initiative to the Americans. Stern did contact the American Military Attach√© in London immediately after war was declared.Armour in Profile p3 In June 1917 the first American approaches were made, but not by the US Army as they had expected. The US Navy wanted the most modern tanks for its US Marine Corps. At that moment the current British tank project was the Mark VI. It was designed with existing British industrial capacity in mind, posing limits that might be overcome by larger American production facilities. Stern therefore pretended that an even more advanced project had already been in existence which he called the Mark VIII (there was also a much more conventional Mark VII project). He invited the Americans to participate and contribute as much as they would like to its design. The Navy was on the brink of sending a team of engineers to Britain when the American Department of War was informed of developments by the US Military Attach√© in London. It ordered the project to be shifted to the Army and selected Major H. W. Alden ‚Äì in peacetime he had been an industrial expert ‚Äì to go to the UK to work with the Mechanical Warfare Department design team at Dollis Hill on the first drawings of the new tank. He arrived in London on the 3 October, to discover that a lot of design work had already been done by Lieutenant G J Rackham, who had been sent to the Front to see for himself how the current designs performed in the dismal conditions then encountered at the battlefield in Flanders. \\"International Tank\\" View of front The US Army had set up headquarters in France. In September it decided to form its own tank corps with 25 tank battalions including five heavy tank battalions. To equip the heavy units, Major James A. Drain ‚Äì a staff officer to General Pershing and responsible for initial planning of the tank force ‚Äì provisionally ordered 600 Mark VI tanks (then under development) from the British in October 1917.Armour in Profile p2 The Army tried to convince the Department of War to divert all available tanks to the Army, leading to a conflict with the Navy (the first of many to come over this issue). This posed serious problems for the British government. It now seemed that American involvement in the war would mean a lesser number of tanks available for the British forces. Also on 4 February 1917 binding agreements had been made with the French about tank production. These had to be renegotiated. Winston Churchill, the new Minister of Munitions, had just been forced to fire Stern as director of the Mechanical Supply Department (Controller of the Mechanical Warfare Department) because of his mistakes in handling the Mark IV project, leading to enormous production delays. In pushing production through in the early days he had upset civil and military authorities. Stern was appointed in September to the new position of \\"Commissioner for Mechanical Warfare (Overseas and Allies Branch)\\" in order to coordinate tank production with the US and France. Stern went to France to meet the French Minister of Munitions, Louis Loucheur and the American commander-in-chief, John Pershing. Loucheur made it clear from the beginning that France had nothing to offer in terms of existing production facilities. This came as no surprise to Stern who had already prepared an \\"International Plan\\" of ten points (in fact a bilateral agreement between the US and Britain) that he now managed to get accepted by the Americans. He submitted this to Churchill on the 11 November. Its main points included (using the original terminology): *The incorporation of a partnership between the US and Great Britain for the production of 1,500 heavy tanks to be erected in France. *The supply of a number of these tanks to France to further the higher purpose of Allied unity, should she require them. (Britain hoped France would produce its own Char 2C in sufficient numbers, Loucheur already knew this was unlikely to happen). *France might supply an erecting shop, if convenient; in any case it might be wiser to build a new one (so a completely new factory would have to be built in France). *A joint supply of components. Britain would supply guns, ammunition, and armour; the USA engines, transmissions, forgings, and chains (employing US car industry). *The design would be based on British experience and American ideas and resources, and eliminate most of the faults in current tanks in power, loading, and trench crossing. *Major Alden would collaborate to finish the working drawings before Christmas enjoying full cooperation of the British; the design was to be approved by both nations. *Unskilled labour might be provided by imported Chinese; the French government ensured their local accommodation. *Production would begin in April 1918 and finally reach 300 a month (so the number of 1,500 was only preliminary). *The project would have high priority in regards raw materials, labour, factories, and transport. *Management would be in the hands of two Commissioners, one British (Stern himself) and one American; but the French could appoint their own if their interests were concerned. The plan already contained a specification: the tank should have a 300 hp (220 kW) engine, weigh 38.8 tons (39.5 tonnes) and have a trench crossing capacity of 14 feet (4.3 m). The 11 November briefing included the first use of the word \\"Liberty\\" for the tank which was taken from the engine chosen. The first design conference took place on 4 December at GHQ in France and Churchill approved the plan soon afterwards. It was made into a formal treaty signed by the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour and the US Ambassador Walter Hines Page on 19 January 1918. The treaty specified the programme in great detail. The first 1,500 tanks had to be made by the end of the year and the factory should be capable of expansion to 1,200 a month. Both goals were very ambitious given the fact there was neither a completed design nor a factory and that British tank production would in fact be 150 a month during 1918. The United States would supply: the engine; radiator; fan; piping; silencer; lighting; dynamo; battery; propeller shaft; transmission, including gearbox; brakes; roller sprockets; gear shift and brake control; track links and pins; rear track sprockets, hub and shafts; front idler hub and shafts; track roller, track spindles and bushings. Britain would supply: bullet and bomb-proof plates; structural members; track shoes and rollers; guns, machine guns and mountings; ammunition racks and ammunition. The agreed price was to be ¬£5,000 per vehicle. In December 1917 the Mark VI order was cancelled ensuring that the Mark VIII would be the new standard Allied weapon. Description The internal fittings of the Mark VIII The Mark VIII kept many of the general features of the Mark I-V series: it had their typical high track run and no revolving turret but two sponsons, one on each side of the tank, armed with a 6-pounder (57 mm) gun. But it also resembled the Mark VI- project in that it had more rounded and wider tracks and a large superstructure on top directly beneath the front of which the driver was seated. An innovative feature was the departure from the concept of the box tank with its single space into which all accessories were crammed. The Mark VIII was compartimentalised with a separate engine room at the back. This vastly improved fighting conditions as a bulkhead protected the crew against the deafening engine noise, noxious fumes and heat. There were no machine guns in the sponsons, only the 6-pounders each manned by a gunner and loader. The side machine guns were to the rear of the sponsons mounted in the hull doors. Major Alden had designed the sponsons to be retractable (they could be swung in at the rear by the crew, being pivoted at the front), to reduce the width of the vehicle if enemy obstacles were encountered. Five more machine guns were in the superstructure: two at the front‚Äîleft and right next to the driver‚Äîand one on each of the other sides. As there was no machine gun position covering the back of the tank there was a dead angle vulnerable to infantry attack. To solve this problem a triangular steel deflector plate was attached. The rear superstructure machine gunner could use it to deflect his fire down into that area behind the tank. The tank carried 208 shells and 13,848 machine gun rounds, mostly in a large ammunition locker in the centre which formed a platform on which the commander stood behind the driver observing the battlefield through a cupola with four vision slits. Later the side superstructure guns were removed on US tanks. The twelfth crew member was the mechanic, seated next to the 300 hp Liberty V-12 (or in British tanks Ricardo V-12) petrol engine) cooled by a large horizontal radiator. Three armoured fuel tanks at the rear held 200 Imperial gallons (240 US gallons, or 909 litres) of fuel giving a range of 89 km. The transmission used a planetary gearbox giving two speeds in either forward or reverse. Top speed was 5.25 mph (8 km/h). To improve its trench crossing ability to 4.88 m the vehicle had a very elongated shape. The track length was 34 ft 2 in (10.42 m) but even though the hull width was an impressive nominal 3.76 m, the actual length- width ratio of the tracks was very poor as that width included the sponsons. Combined with wide tracks it proved difficult to turn the tank. During testing many tracks twisted and broke in a turn and it was decided to use longer, stronger 13.25 inch (337 mm) links made of hardened cast armour plate, stiffened by webs formed by recesses in the track plate. Another effect of the narrow hull was that the fighting compartment was also very narrow. This was made worse by the fact that now the gap between the double track frames at each side was very wide; earlier types had only the tracks themselves widened. Nevertheless, the tank was supposed to accommodate another twenty infantry men in full gear if necessary. In absolute terms the vehicle was very large: at 10 ft 3 in (3.13 m) tall the Mark VIII was the second largest operational tank in history, after the Char 2C. However its weight was only Armour in Profile p12 fitted for battle as the armour plate was thin with a thickness of 16 mm on the front and sides‚Äîa slight improvement over the Mark V but very thin by later standards. The roof and bottom of the hull were protected by only 6 mm thick armour plate, leaving the tank very vulnerable to mortar shells and landmines. Production The French government hoped to receive 700 Mark VIIIs for free, as the French superheavy tank, the Char 2C, could not be produced in sufficient numbers, if at all. However, suffering from a lack of manpower and raw materials the French were not forthcoming in providing any facilities for the production of the International Tank. Soon the Americans decided to build a brand new assembly factory at Neuvy-Pailloux 200 miles south of Paris, contracting a British company. Far from producing its first tank in April, the factory was not even finished by June. In August they contracted another British firm. It finished the factory in November, by which point the war had already ended; not a single tank would be built there. There were also serious delays in the production of the components. The Liberty aero engine with its expensive drawn-steel cylinders was redesigned with cheaper cast iron cylinders.Schipper, J. Edward (1919) \\"The Liberty Engine\\", Flight magazine, no. 523 (Vol XI no. 1), 2 January 1919, pp 6-10 These redesigned engines were only produced in October. In spite of these delays, there were plans to produce a further 1,500 tanks in the United States on top of the shared production in France. This was not possible due to lack of armour and guns so the extra production was to be in France as well. The British finished the prototype hull, made of unhardened steel, in July and sent it to the United States. On arrival it transpired that no mass-produced parts were ready to finish the prototype, so the Locomobile Automobile Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut made these all by hand, completing the first vehicle on the 28 September. Testing began on 31 October. Only then was the armament shipped from Britain, and two guns and ten Hotchkiss machine guns were fitted. Testing was finished after the war and it was decided to build 100 vehicles in the USA; these were constructed in 1919 and 1920 by the Rock Island Arsenal for $35,000 each. The US bought 100 complete sets of parts for the hull from the British, the whole amount that had been completed. Meanwhile, the British government had decided to start their own production in Britain. One thousand, four hundred and fifty vehicles were ordered from the North British Locomotive Company, William Beardmore and Company and Metropolitan, to use a 300 hp (220 kW) V12 Ricardo engine instead of the Liberty. Only the first managed to produce anything by the end of the war with seven vehicles built. The mild steel prototype with a Rolls-Royce engineArmour in Profile p5 was tested on 11 November, the day of the Armistice. From parts already produced a further 24 vehicles were completed after the war. Five were sent to the training centre at Bovington in Dorset, and the others went straight to the scrap dealer. Mark VIII* During 1918, the then prevalent preoccupation with trench crossing capabilities led to preparations being made for the production of an even longer tank: the Mark VIII* (Star). The hull was to be lengthened a full three meters: four feet (1.2 m) at the front and six feet (1.8 m) at the back. This way it should be able to cross a trench 18 feet (5.5 m) wide. To ensure that the tank could turn at all, despite its critically high length-width ratio, the bottom profile of the tracks would be more strongly curved, so that a smaller part of the track would touch the ground. Ground pressure would have increased however, as total weight reached 42.5 tons (43.2 tonnes). If the tank had sunk into soft ground somewhat, it's questionable whether it would have been able to make a turn. No prototype was built. Operational history The American Liberty tanks equipped a single unit: the 67th Infantry (Tank) Regiment, based in Aberdeen, Maryland. The curious designation of the unit had its origin in the fact that since 1922 by law all tanks had to be part of the Infantry. The two machine gun positions at the sides of the superstructure were eliminated, so the crew could be reduced to ten. Water-cooled M1917 Browning machine guns were used. Despite many modifications the vehicles suffered from overheating and poor reliability, causing a prejudice in the Army against the use of heavy tanks. From 1932 onward they were phased out; all were in storage in 1934. In 1940, Canada had a lack of training tanks and were offered the remaining tanks at scrap value, but the Canadians instead opted to purchase M1917 light tanks.Tank Mark VIII International Liberty Surviving examples *A Liberty tank survives at Fort Meade in Maryland. The tank is displayed in the Post Museum and was made in 1920 at the Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois. It was assigned to the 301st Tank Battalion (Heavy), later redesignated the 17th Tank Battalion (Heavy). Throughout most of 1921‚Äì1922, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower commanded this unit. *A second American Liberty tank was at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland; it was moved to the National Armor and Cavalry Museum at Fort Benning, Georgia in 2010, and has been inside ever since. The interior has extensive damage from water/rust, although plans are in place for restoration. * The British never allocated their Mark VIIIs to a tank unit; a single vehicle survives at the Bovington Tank Museum. The tank appearing in the 1989 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade movie was a replica vehicle made from an excavator, following the hull shape of the Mark VIII but with a turret added.

The Owen was the only entirely Australian-designed and constructed service submachine gun of World War II and was used by the Australian Army from 1943 until the mid-1960s. History Private Evelyn Owen, circa 1941 Owen, an inventor from Wollongong, was 24 years old in July 1939 when he demonstrated his prototype .22 calibre \\"Machine Carbine\\" to Australian Army ordnance officers at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. The gun was rejected for two reasons. The first was because the Australian army, at the time, did not recognise the value of submachine guns. The second was the basic construction of the prototype was completely unsuited as a military weapon, especially as it lacked a proper trigger or any safety device, was of small calibre, and the \\"magazine\\" was effectively a giant revolver cylinder which could not be exchanged to reload. Following the outbreak of war, Owen joined the Australian Army as a private. In September 1940, Owen's neighbour, Vincent Wardell, discovered Owen's prototype in a sugar bag. Wardell was manager of a large steel products factory at Port Kembla. He showed it to Owen's father who was distressed at his son's carelessness, but explained the history of the weapon. Wardell was impressed by the simplicity of Owen's design. Wardell arranged to have Owen transferred to the Army Inventions Board, to re-commence work on the gun. The army continued to view the weapon in a negative light, but the government took an increasingly favourable view. The prototype was equipped with a \\"magazine\\" consisting of a steel ring, drilled with holes for .22 cartridges, that was revolved through the action using the power of a gramophone spring. This arrangement later gave way to a top-mounted box magazine, which allowed shooting while prone. The choice of calibre took some time to be settled. As large quantities of Colt .45 ACP cartridges were available; it was decided to adopt the Owen gun for it. Official trials were organised, and the John Lysaght factory made three versions in 9√ó19mm, .38-200 and .45 ACP. Sten and Thompson submachine guns were used as benchmarks. As part of the testing, all of the guns were immersed in mud and covered with sand to simulate the harshest environments in which they would be used. The Owen was the only gun that still operated after the treatment. Although the test showed the Owen's capability, the army could not decide on a calibre, and it was only after intervention from the higher levels of government that the army ordered the 9√ó19mm variant. During the gun's life, its reliability earned it the nickname \\"Digger's Darling\\" by Australian troops, and it was rumoured to be highly favoured by US troops. General Douglas MacArthur proposed placing an order for some 45,000. Production and use Owen guns on a truck during a Christmas parade in Sydney, 1942 The Owen went into production at the John Lysaght factories at Port Kembla and Newcastle. Between March 1942 and February 1943, Lysaght's produced 28,000 Owen guns. However, the initial batch of ammunition turned out to be the wrong type and 10,000 guns could not be supplied with ammunition. Once again the government overrode military bureaucracy, and took the ammunition through the final production stages and into the hands of Australian troops, at that time fighting Japanese forces in New Guinea. Approximately 45,000 Owens were produced from 1942 to 1944. Contemporary sources vary as to the cost of production during wartime, with some suggesting that the basic cost was as little as A¬£8 (US$24); a contemporary US source stated that the Owen cost US$30 (A¬£12).\\"Submachine Gun Becomes Pistol by Detaching Butt.\\" Popular Mechanics, November 1945, p. 75. Two soldiers armed with Owen guns in New Britain, April 1945 Although it was somewhat bulky, the Owen became very popular with soldiers because of its reliability. New Zealanders fighting in the Guadacanal and Solomon Islands campaigns swapped their Thompson submachine guns for Owens, as they found Owen guns to be more reliable. The Owen was later used by Australian troops in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, particularly the scouts in infantry sections. It remained a standard weapon of the Australian Army until the mid-1960s, when it was replaced by the F1 submachine gun and, later, the M16. Design CPL Buddy Lea of Delta Company, 6 RAR, armed with an Owen gun in South Vietnam during 1966 The Owen has a simple blowback design, firing from an open bolt. It was designed to be fired either from the shoulder or the hip. It is easily recognisable, owing to its unconventional appearance, including the top- mounted magazine, and the side-mounted sight required to allow the firer to aim past it. The placement of the magazine allows gravity to assist the magazine spring in pushing cartridges down to the breech, which improves feeding reliability. Another unusual feature is the separate compartment inside the receiver, which isolates the small-diameter bolt from its retracting handle by means of a small bulkhead. This prevents dirt and mud from jamming the bolt, and makes the Owen a highly reliable weapon. Foreign dirt entering the gun would collect at the back of the receiver, where it would drain out or be expelled through a small opening. When tested, the Owen gun was able to continue firing despite being dipped in mud and drenched with sand, while a Sten gun and a Thompson also tested stopped functioning at once. In jungle warfare, where both mud and sand were frequent problems, the Owen gun was highly regarded by the soldiers. To facilitate cleaning, the ejector was built into the magazine, rather than the body of the gun. This allowed the barrel to be removed rapidly, by pulling up a spring-loaded plunger in front of the magazine housing. After removing the barrel, the bolt and return spring are removed in a forward direction, completely dismantling the gun. Like the Sten, the Owen had a non-folding wire buttstock, but also had pistol grips like the Austen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf6XALbTnik Two horseshoe magazines were constructed in the field, of 60 and 72 rounds. Little information exists as to the success of these experiments. In 2004, an underground weapons factory was seized in Melbourne, Australia, yielding, among other things, three silenced copies of the Owen submachine gun and parts to make six more. These had magazines inserted underneath rather than overhead, and were suspected of having been built for sale to local gangs involved in the illegal drug trade.

Located in the state's capital, Juneau, the building was opened on February 14, 1931 as a federal building. After Alaska gained statehood, the building served as the home for the Alaska Legislature. History Upon the purchase of Russian America, Sitka, Alaska became the Territory Capital in 1867. After the capital was moved to Juneau, the Legislature met in rented rooms around the city. Construction for a capitol building was partly funded by the United States Congress, but they refused to give more. Local citizens managed to pay the rest of the cost for land, which was then given to the government. Construction on the building began on September 18, 1929, and it ended on February 2, 1931. The building, originally named the Federal and Territorial Building was dedicated on February 14, 1931. It hosted federal services until 1959, where the Alaska Statehood Act granted Alaska permission to settle in the building. The capitol has been attempted to be relocated. These attempts began as early as 1960, where a proposal to move the government to the Cook Inlet area failed. The most recent attempt was in 2002. Architecture and interior The chamber of the House of Representatives The Senate chamber The building is six stories high and made from brick-faced reinforced concrete, with a facade of Indiana limestone on the first two floors. The portico has four columns made of Tokeen marble from Prince of Wales Island, which is also used for interior trim. Because it lacks the large landscaped grounds of most state capitols, it could appear to be simply an office building. It is one of only eleven state capitols (along with those of Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia) that do not feature a dome. Outside the building is a replica of the Liberty Bell, of the type given to all states and territories by the federal government in 1950 to help raise support for savings bond drives. The lobby features clay murals titled Harvest of the Land and Harvest of the Sea, representing hunting and fishing, as well as a bust of Alaska Native activist Elizabeth Peratrovich. Offices and committee rooms fill the ground and first floors. The second floor houses the chambers of the Alaska Senate and Alaska House of Representatives, as well as committee rooms. The walls feature the work of early Juneau photographers Lloyd Winter and Percy Pond, and busts of the first two U.S. Senators from Alaska, Bob Bartlett and Ernest Gruening. Governor of Alaska's office The Alaska Governor and Lieutenant Governor's offices are located on the third floor. The executive office doors are made of black birch, with hand carvings depicting Alaskan industry. The \\"Hall of Governors\\" features portraits of governors and lieutenant governors of Alaska from the District of Alaska era to the present. More legislative offices and committee rooms occupy the fourth floor. The fifth floor holds legislative finance committees. Many areas of the building have been restored to their original 1930s appearance, especially on the second and fifth floors--the latter originally had federal courtrooms. In 2012, the State of Alaska undertook a 4-year, $33 million project to provide seismic upgrades to the building as well as further restore the building to its original appearance.

Biography Palmcrantz was born at Hammerdal in J√§mtland, Sweden. He was the son of Per Gustaf Palmcrantz (1806‚Äì1905) and Lovisa Ulrika Nordenmark His father was a captain in the J√§mtland Ranger Regiment. He was enlisted as a cadet in his father's regiment, where he worked on land survey. After a couple of years he left the regiment to study at the Technological Institute of Stockholm, later known as KTH Royal Institute of Technology. In partnership with his brother-in-law, Theodor Winborg (1832-1918), Palmcrantz founded a small workshop on Vollmar Yxkullsgatan 25, S√∂dermalm, Stockholm. As number of employees increased along with the production volume, he moved to a new factory on Kungsholmen, Stockholm, where they manufactured firearms, reaping machines, mowers and other agricultural equipment of their own design. Later on there would be Palmcrantz factory, Palmcrantzska Fabriken, on L√∂vholmen, Stockholm. In 1868, the first version of his machine-gun was finished and a demonstration of its capacity was held on Ladug√•rdsg√§rdet, Stockholm in front of the Swedish Defense Minister; G.R. Abel. After a couple of modifications and improvements, he patented the multi-barrel, lever- actuated, machine gun and it was bought into the Swedish army. Same year, the machine-gun was shown on the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. To reach international success, Palmcrantz met industrialist Thorsten Nordenfelt (1842-1920) in 1875 and the latter's company became his British agent. They agreed to market the machine-gun under the then well known Nordenfelt brand and his second model would later be known as the Nordenfelt machine-gun after his financial backer. It was Nordenfelt who convinced Palmcrantz to increase the caliber of his gun to one inch, making it a suitable weapon for use against the growing threat of torpedo boats. Palmcrantz succumbed to an early death from a bleeding ulcer. He was buried at Norra Begravningsplatsen in Stockholm. Helge Palmcrantz has a former school named after him; Palmcrantzskolan in √ñstersund.

The United States Navy ordered one prototype, model number G-34, from Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation on 30 June 1938; its designation was XF5F-1. The aircraft had a unique appearance: The forward \\"nose\\" of the fuselage did not extend forward of the wing. Provisions were included for two 20 mm (0.906 in) Madsen cannon as armament. Design and development In 1938 Grumman presented a proposal to the U. S. Navy for a twin engine carrier based aircraft, unlike any other fighter aircraft that had ever been considered. The design was for a lightweight fighter (under 10,000 lbs maximum takeoff weight) powered by two 1,200 hp Wright R-1820 engines, with propellers geared to rotate in opposite directions to cancel out the effects of each engine's torque, promising high-speed, and an outstanding rate of climb.\\"The 'Fastest Pursuit' Grumman Skyrocket XF5F/Black Hawk.\\" fiddlersgreen.net, 2012. Retrieved: 18 May 2012. The XF5F Skyrocket was a low- wing monoplane with a short fuselage that began aft of the wing's leading edge with a twin tail assembly that featured a pronounced dihedral to the horizontal stabilizer. The main landing gear and tail wheel were fully retractable.Thompson, Dan. \\"Grumman F5F-1 Skyrocket.\\" Blackhawk, 2012. Retrieved: 18 May 2012. Grumman XF5F-1 Skyrocket c. 1940 Operational history The aircraft flew for the first time on 1 April 1940. Engine cooling problems arose in the initial flights, resulting in modification to the oil cooling ducts. Further modifications were made to the prototype including reduction in the height of the cockpit canopy, revising the armament installation to four 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in place of the cannon, redesign of the engine nacelles, adding spinners to the propellers, and extending the fuselage forward of the wing. These changes were completed on 15 July 1941. Testing by Grumman test pilot \\"Connie\\" Converse indicated \\"the flying qualities for the XF5F-1 were good overall. The counter-rotating props were a nice feature, virtually eliminating the torque effect on takeoff ... single-engine performance was good, rudder forces tended to be high in single engine configuration. Spin recovery was positive but elevator forces required for recovery were unusually high. All acrobatics were easily performed, and of course forward visibility was excellent.\\"Lucabaugh and Martin 1995, p. 14. In 1941, Navy pilots tested the XF5F-1 in a fly-off against the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Bell XFL Airabonita, Vought XF4U Corsair, Grumman F4F Wildcat, and Brewster F2A Buffalo. LCDR Crommelin, in charge of the test, stated in a 1985 letter to George Skurla, Grumman president: > \\"for instance, I remember testing the XF5F against the XF4U on climb to the > 10,000 foot level. I pulled away from the Corsair so fast I thought he was > having engine trouble. The F5F was a carrier pilot's dream, as opposite > rotating propellers eliminated all torque and you had no large engine up > front to look around to see the LSO (landing signal officer) ... The > analysis of all the data definitely favored the F5F, and the Spitfire came > in a distant second. ... ADM Towers told me that securing spare parts ... > and other particulars which compounded the difficulty of building the twin- > engine fighter, had ruled out the Skyrocket and that the Bureau had settled > on the Wildcat for mass production.\\"Lucabaugh and Martin 1995, p. 16. Additional changes were needed after further flight tests that were not completed until 15 January 1942. In the meantime, Grumman began work on a more advanced twin-engine shipboard fighter, the XF7F-1, and further testing with the XF5F-1 supported the development of the newer design. The prototype continued to be used in various tests, although plagued by various landing gear problems, until it was struck from the list of active aircraft after it made a belly landing on 11 December 1944.

It represented a less soluble and less toxic alternative to then-used Paris Green, which is about 10x more toxic. It also adhered better to the surface of the plants, further enhancing and prolonging its insecticidal effect. Lead arsenate was widely used in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, US, England, France, North Africa, and many other areas, principally against the codling moth and snow-white linden moth. It was used mainly on apples, but also on other fruit trees, garden crops, turfgrasses, and against mosquitoes. In combination with ammonium sulfate, it was used in southern California as a winter treatment on lawns to kill crab grass seed. The search for a substitute was commenced in 1919, when it was found that its residues remain in the products despite washing their surfaces. Alternatives were found to be less effective or more toxic to plants and animals, until 1947 when DDT was found. US EPA banned use of lead arsenate on food crops in 1988.

Ettor (center), flanked by Joseph Caruso and Arturo Giovannitti, his co- defendants in the 1912 Lawrence trial Signature of Ettor, ca. 1913. Joseph James \\"Smiling Joe\\" Ettor (1885‚Äì1948) was an Italian-American trade union organizer who, in the middle-1910s, was one of the leading public faces of the Industrial Workers of the World. Ettor is best remembered as a defendant in a controversial trial related to a killing in the seminal Lawrence Textile Strike of 1912, in which he was acquitted of charges of having been an accessory. Biography =Early years= Joseph James Ettor, known to his friends as \\"Joe\\" or \\"Smiling Joe,\\" was born on October 6, 1885 in New York City, the son of a laborer who had emigrated to America from Italy.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 67. Ettor went to work at the age of 12 selling newspapers. He later worked as a waterboy on a railroad, as a saw- filer in a lumber mill, as a barrel-maker, as a shipyard worker, and in a cigar factory. =Union career= Joe Ettor went to work for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1906 as an organizer, continuing in that capacity for the next decade. An outstanding and inspirational public speaker who was fluent in Italian and English, Ettor's earliest organizing work on behalf of the IWW took place in the Western United States, where he had worked unionizing miners and migrant laborers.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement of the United States: Volume 4: The Industrial Workers of the World, 1905-1917. New York: International Publishers, 1965; pg. 317. He also had cut his teeth organizing foreign-born workers in the steel mills and shoe factories of the East. Ettor was active in the 1907 lumber strike in Portland, Oregon, the 1909 McKees Rocks Strike and another lesser-known steel strike later that year in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, a strike of Pennsylvania coal miners in 1909-10, and a Brooklyn shoe factory strike in 1910-11. Employers feared \\"Ettorism\\". This 1913 anti-union cartoon from The American Employer depicts an IWW organizing drive as \\"a volcano of hate stirred into active eruption at Akron, by alien hands, which pour into the crater the disturbing acids and alkalis of greed, class hatred and anarchy. From the mouth of the pit rise poisonous clouds of suspicion, malice and envy to pollute the air, while from the cracked and breaking sides of the groaning mountain flow streams of lava of murder, anarchy and destruction, threatening to engulf in their path the fair cities and fertile farms of Ohio.\\"In 1908, Ettor was named to the governing General Executive Board of the IWW, remaining in that capacity until 1914. On January 1, 1912, in accordance with a new state law, the textile mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts posted new rules limiting the hours of workers to 54 a week, down from a standard of 56 previously in effect.Foner, History of the Labor Movement of the United States: Volume 4, pg. 315. It soon became clear that the employers had no intention of adjusting wage rates upwards to compensate for the lost work time, and a strike ensued. Joe Ettor addresses striking Brooklyn barbers in Union Square, New York City, May 17, 1913. On January 12, 1912, the Italian language branch of IWW Local 20 decided to send to New York City for Joe Ettor, the organization's top Italian language leader, to come to Lawrence and lead the strike. Ettor arrived with Arturo Giovannitti, secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation, a language federation of the Socialist Party of America and editor of the socialist newspaper Il Proletario [The Proletarian], who was not himself at the time a member of the IWW. Ettor instantly called on all his skills, including his ability to speak five languages, to rally the strikers. On his first afternoon in Lawrence, he addressed thousands of strikers, fostering solidarity and discouraging violence. \\"All the blood that is spilled in a strike is your blood,\\" he told strikers.Watson, Bruce, Bread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and The Struggle for the American Dream, pg. 59. Denouncing the mill owners, sympathizing with the toil of textile workers, Ettor called for an even larger walkout. \\"Monday morning you have got to close the mills that you have caused to shut down, tighter than you have them now.\\" Ettor then set up fourteen strike committees based on nationality, and began meeting daily with everyone from the mayor of Lawrence to the various strikers in committee. Mill owners instantly recognized Ettor's power and tried to discredit him by planting dynamite in a store where he picked up his mail. But the plot was quickly detected and Ettor continued organizing the strike. During the walkout, which came to be known as the Bread and Roses Strike, IWW striker Anna LoPizzo was shot and killed. Joseph Caruso was charged with the murder and Ettor and Giovannitti, both of whom were giving speeches several miles away from the crime scene, were arrested as accomplices. The three were eventually acquitted in a trial before Salem judge Joseph F. Quinn. Ettor was one of the leaders of the Waiters strike of 1912 in New York City, and the Brooklyn barbers strike of 1913. The question of violence was a perennial matter of discussion and debate within the IWW. Some, like Giovannitti, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Vincent St. John, took the position that while the union did not favor violence, it would not shy away from its use if necessary to accomplish the social revolution.Foner, History of the Labor Movement of the United States: Volume 4, pg. 164. Ettor, on the other hand, shared the orientation of \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood that the only kind of force to which the organization could lend its name was the use of the general strike for the overthrow of capitalism. Ettor became a member of the executive council of the IWW. In 1916, he left the IWW along with Flynn after a dispute over the Mesabi range strike. =Death and legacy= In later years, Ettor ran a fruit orchard in San Clemente, California, where he died in 1948.

It is written and drawn by David Lapham. The story deals with the often criminal and sometimes tragic misadventures of a large cast of characters and takes place from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. Published on an irregular basis since 1995, the comic has had close to 100 issues and is a long-time critically acclaimed series. Publication history The first issue was published in 1995 and followed an irregular publishing schedule through its fortieth issue, which was published in 2005. In a 2007 interview with Michael Lorah for the Newsarama website, Lapham revealed that the series, including the final issue of the current story arc, was on hold indefinitely: In 2009, a new ten-page story titled, Stray Bullets: Open the Goddamn Box appeared in Noir: A Collection of Crime Comics, an anthology book published by Dark Horse Comics. In March 2014, Image Comics ended the hiatus of Stray Bullets with the publication of the final issue of the HiJinks and Derring-Do arc, and the simultaneous launch of a new series and arc titled Stray Bullets: Killers. A giant-sized softcover trade paperback edition (The Uber Alles Edition) collecting all forty-one issues of the original series was also released by Image Comics. Killers ran for eight issues throughout 2014. Following a brief hiatus, Lapham returned in early 2015 with another new story arc/series titled Stray Bullets: Sunshine & Roses that ended with after 42 issues in August 2020. Lapham plans to continue publishing Stray Bullets in this fashion at Image, with each arc treated as a discrete miniseries. Lapham additionally published two issues of the Amy Racecar Color Special in 1997 and 1998, starring the alter ego of lead character Virginia Applejack. Collected editions There has been an assortment of volumes reprinting the original comic books.

Description  Closeup of inflorescence It grows as a perennial plant, usually as a subshrub though it can take any form from a herb to a shrub depending on conditions; the plants are usually woody at the base. The leaves are generally 5‚Äì8 cm in length. Their form changes from the bottom to the top of the plant, the lower leaves being petiolate while the upper leaves are sessile. The leaves grow in opposite pairs and are oval or lanceolate in shape. The plant flowers profusely, and though the individual flowers are small (no more than 2 mm), the inflorescences are large and showy. The flowers are small in rounded clusters each with 5 fused petals and a spur. The most typical color is a brick red or purplish red, but colors include deep crimson, pale pink, and lavender. Centranthus ruber 'Albus' (about 10% of individuals) has white blooms. Flowering takes place in early summer and, in cool summer areas, continues sporadically throughout the summer and into fall. The cultivar 'coccineus' is especially long-blooming. The blooms have a strong and somewhat rank scent. They are pollinated by both bees and butterflies and the plant is noted for attracting insects. It is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades. Seeds have tufts similar to dandelions that allow wind dispersal, and as such can self-seed freely and become invasive if not properly controlled.  Distribution  Growing atop old walls in Ireland A native of the Mediterranean region, Centranthus ruber has been introduced into many other parts of the world as a garden escape. It is naturalised in France, Australia, Great Britain, Ireland and the United States. In the US it can be found growing wild in such western states as Arizona, Utah, California, Hawaii, Washington, and Oregon, usually in disturbed, rocky places at elevations below 200 m. It is often seen by roadsides or in urban wasteland. It can tolerate very alkaline soil conditions. Because it can tolerate the lime in mortar, Centranthus ruber may frequently be seen growing in old walls in Italy, southern France and south- west England.  Uses  White form of Centranthus ruber Centranthus ruber showing both petioled and sessile leaf forms. Both leaves and roots can be eaten, the leaves either fresh in salads or lightly boiled, the roots boiled in soups. Opinions differ as to whether either make very good eating, however. Although it is sometimes reported to have medicinal properties, there is no basis for this view, which is almost certainly due to confusion with true valerian, (Valeriana officinalis).  Invasive species  It is listed as a NEMBA 1b invasive in the Western Cape, South Africa. It is an invasive species that may not be owned, imported into South Africa, grown, moved, sold, given as a gift or dumped in a waterway. It is therefore an Invasive species requiring compulsory control as part of an invasive species control programme to remove and destroy. The plants are deemed to have such a high invasive potential that infestations can qualify to be placed under a government sponsored invasive species management programme. No permits will be issued.

Arturo M. Giovannitti (1884, in Ripabottoni ‚Äì 1959, in New York City) was an Italian-American union leader, socialist political activist, and poet. He is best remembered as one of the principal organizers of the 1912 Lawrence textile strike and as a defendant in a celebrated trial caused by that event. Early life Arturo Giovannitti was born January 7, 1884, in Ripabottoni in what is now the Province of Campobasso, Italy, at the time part of the Abruzzi but now part of Molise. He immigrated to Canada in 1900 and, after working in a coal mine and railroad crew, began preaching in a Presbyterian mission. He soon came to the United States, where he studied at Union Theological Seminary. Although he did not graduate, he ran rescue missions for Italians in Brooklyn and Pittsburgh. He also began writing for the weekly newspaper of the Italian Socialist Federation. In 1911, he became the newspaper's editor. Political career On January 1, 1912, in accordance with a new state law, the textile mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts posted new rules limiting the hours of workers to 54 a week, down from the previous 56.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement of the United States: Volume 4: The Industrial Workers of the World, 1905-1917. New York: International Publishers, 1965; pg. 315. It soon became clear that the employers had no intention of adjusting wage rates upwards to make up for the lost work time, and a strike ensued. On January 12, 1912, the Italian-language branch of the Industrial Workers of the World Local 20 decided to send to New York City for Joe Ettor, the organization's top Italian-language leader, to come to Lawrence and lead the strike.Foner, History of the Labor Movement of the United States: Volume 4, pg. 317. Within a few days, Ettor called his friend Giovannitti to Lawrence to coordinate relief efforts. Giovannitti soon began speaking to Italians. His most noted address was his \\"Sermon on the Common,\\" which modified Jesus's Beatitudes to decidedly less passive stances, such as \\"Blessed are the rebels, for they shall reconquer the earth.\\"Watson, Bread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream, pg. 218. On January 29, a striker, Anna LoPizzo, was shot and killed during a police crackdown on an unruly mob. Although Ettor and Giovannitti were three miles from the scene, both were arrested and imprisoned, along with one other striker, on the charge of inciting a riot leading to the loss of life. While in jail, Giovannitti wrote many poems. By the time of the trial, that fall, several were published in leading journals, bringing him widespread fame. Giovannitti's poem \\"The Walker,\\" in which he recounted the tormented footsteps of a prisoner, brought him comparisons to Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde. The imprisonment of Ettor and Giovannitti became a cause c√©l√®bre, attracting nationwide attention and inspiring activists who called for the guaranteeing of free speech. Workers from across the US contributed to the Ettor-Giovannitti Defense Fund, which eventually totaled $50,000.Watson, 255 The trial of Ettor, Giovannitti, and the co-defendant accused of actually firing the shot that killed the picketer, began on September 30, 1912 in Salem, Massachusetts before Judge Joseph F. Quinn. As was the custom in capital cases in Massachusetts, the three defendants were kept in an open metal cage in the courtroom. The trial received coverage throughout North America and Europe. Prosecution witnesses quoted from speeches by Ettor and Giovannitti. Ettor: \\"This town won't be very happy in two days. Something is going to happen... keep the gun shops busy....\\"Watson, 250 Giovannitti (to strikers): \\"Prowl around like wild animals looking for the blood of the scabs.\\"Watson, 251 Yet defense witnesses testified without contradiction that Ettor and Giovannitti were miles away from the scene of the murder while Joseph Caruso, the third defendant in the case, was at home eating supper at the time of the killing. Giovannitti and Ettor both delivered closing statements at the end of the two-month trial. Giovannitti's speech brought many in the gallery to tears. Though he began by noting it was \\"the first time in my life that I speak publicly in your wonderful language,\\"Watson, 257 he soon spoke eloquently about his love of life: > I am twenty-nine years old. I have a woman that loves me and that I love. I > have a mother and father that are waiting for me. I have an ideal that is > dearer to me than can be expressed or understood. And life has so many > allurements and it is so nice and bright and so wonderful that I feel the > passion of living in my heart.Watson, 258 Yet if allowed to go free, he added, > Let me tell you that the first strike that breaks again in this Commonwealth > or any other place in America where the work and the help and the > intelligence of Joseph J. Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti will be needed and > necessary, there we shall go again regardless of any fear and any threat. We > shall return again to our humble efforts, obscure, humble, unknown, > misunderstood -- soldiers of this mighty army of the working class of the > world, which out of the shadows and the darkness of the past is striving > towards the destined goal which is the emancipation of human kind, which is > the establishment of love and brotherhood and justice for every man and > every woman in this earth.Watson, 258-259 All three defendants were acquitted, on November 26, 1912. Subsequent activism In the wake of the trial, Giovannitti published his first book of poems, Arrows in the Gale, in 1914. In an introduction to the book, Helen Keller wrote: \\"Giovannitti is, like Shelley, a poet of revolt against the cruelty, the poverty, the ignorance which too many of us accept.\\"Watson, 243 But Giovannitti, following ten months in prison, avoided involvement in volatile strikes. Instead, he devoted himself to poetry, editing radical journals and protesting World War I, which claimed two of his brothers. In 1916, he participated in Percy MacKaye's production of Caliban by the Yellow Sands, translating it into Italian. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he appeared at various workers' rallies, charming crowds with his Vandyke beard and flowery Italian and English. Death In 1950, Giovannitti was stricken by paralysis in both legs. He remained bedridden until his death in the Bronx, in 1959. Giovannitti's papers, including a typescript play called The Alpha and the Omega (In Memory of a very Rich Holy Man), are housed at the University of Minnesota.

Qh5 History and nomenclature Like many rare openings, 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 has acquired several names over the years, none of which are universally used. The earliest known appearance in print was in the Dubuque Chess Journal in May 1875, where it was dubbed the Kentucky Opening, perhaps in reference to a game played in Danville, Kentucky, which was published in the August issue of the same magazine.Fields-Young, Danville Kentucky 1875, Dubuque Chess Journal, August 1875, page 371 scanned at Hathitrust (This name was also applied by J. H. Blackburne to the unsound Jerome Gambit.) In the American Chess Bulletin in 1905, the opening was referred to as the Danvers Opening, so named by E. E. Southard, a well-known psychiatrist and a strong amateur chess player, after the hospital where he worked. Bernard Parham of Indianapolis is the first master-level player known to have advocated this line. Parham is known for his eccentric theories on the game of chess, which he has developed into what he calls the \\"Matrix System\\". Parham's Matrix System advocates early development of the queen in several positions, as in his favored line as White against the Sicilian Defence, 1.e4 c5 2.Qh5?! Parham argues that just as Richard R√©ti and Aron Nimzowitsch pioneered the hypermodern style of chess, his own ideas which are considered strange today may well be considered viable in the future. Several internet-based sources refer to 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 as the Parham Attack or Parham Opening. The most notable use of 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 by a grandmaster occurred in 2005, when U.S. Champion and future World Championship contender Hikaru Nakamura played it in two tournament games. The best known of these was against Indian GM Krishnan Sasikiran at the May 2005 Sigeman Tournament in Copenhagen/Malm√∂, Denmark.Nakamura-Sasikiran, 13th Sigeman & Co 2005. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2006-02-09. Nakamura got a reasonable position out of the opening but lost the game due to a mistake made in the middlegame. He later wrote on the Internet, \\"I do believe that 2.Qh5 is a playable move, in fact I had a very good position in the game, and was close to winning if I had in fact played 23.e5.\\"Nakamura on 2.Qh5. Mig Greengard. Published 2005-05-05. Retrieved on 2009-02-06. The previous month, Nakamura had played 2.Qh5 against GM Nikola Mitkov at the April 2005 HB Global Chess Challenge in Minneapolis. The game ended in a draw after 55 moves.Nakamura-Mitkov, HB Global Chess Challenge 2005. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2006-02-09.

Harrelson achieved a draw after being assisted by several grandmasters who were in Prague attending the match between Alexei Shirov and Judit Polg√°r.Hans Ree, Jake, Joe and Garry. ChessCafe.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06. The next year Kasparov again faced the opening as Black when tennis star Boris Becker played it against him in an exhibition game in New York.Becker-Kasparov, New York exhibition 2000. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2006-02-09. This time Kasparov won in 17 moves. Assessment The Danvers Opening violates a conventional opening principle by developing the queen too early, subjecting it to attack (although it is relatively safe after retreating to f3). Nonetheless, the opening causes Black some problems. Left to his own devices, Black would probably develop with ...Nf6, ...Bc5, and ...Nc6. The Danvers Opening hinders this by forcing Black (unless he wants to sacrifice a pawn) to first defend the e-pawn (usually with 2...Nc6), then after 3.Bc4 to either play 3...g6 (virtually committing Black to fianchettoing his king bishop), 3...Qe7 (blocking the bishop), or 3...Qf6 (taking away the knight's best square). In 2005, the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree called 2.Qh5 \\"a provocative but quite sensible move\\", and suspected it would have been effective because of its shock value.Hans Ree, Perils of the Sea. ChessCafe.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06. As with the similar Napoleon Opening (2.Qf3?!), White hopes for the Scholar's Mate, e.g. 2.Qh5 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6?? 4.Qxf7#. In both cases, Black can easily avoid the trap, but 2.Qf3 does not pose the impediments to natural development of Black's pieces that 2.Qh5 does. Possible continuations Black's worst possible response to 2.Qh5 is 2...Ke7?? 3.Qxe5#.Eric Schiller-Pack, 1969. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06. (This line ties with a few others for the fastest possible checkmate by White.) Because most games with the Danvers Opening have been played at weak scholastic tournaments, 2...g6?? has often been seen, losing a rook and pawn to 3.Qxe5+. The two moves that have received attention from higher-level players are 2...Nc6 and 2...Nf6!? =2...Nc6= This is the most common continuation. Black defends his e5-pawn from the queen and prepares to meet 3.Bc4 with 3...Qe7 (followed by ...Nf6) or 3...g6. The latter move is more common, however, and after 4.Qf3 Nf6 5.Ne2 the main position is reached (see diagram). White is not worse, but also has no advantage. Black can adopt different plans, one of the most popular being 5...Bg7, where 6.0-0 is White's best try for dynamic play, as 6.d3 d5 will lead to an even position with few attacking chances, and 6.Nbc3 Nb4 is interesting but promises little for White. Grandmasters Krishnan Sasikiran and Nikola Mitkov played this move against Hikaru Nakamura in 2005. =2...Nf6!?= Introducing a speculative gambit called the Kiddie Countergambit.http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1527454 It is unnecessary to sacrifice a pawn for development, since the White queen will have to lose a eventually; however, FIDE Master Dennis Monokroussos advocates the move as the \\"psychologically correct\\" response.Dennis Monokroussos, Nakamura-Sasikiran and Junk Openings, thechessmind.net, 23 April 2005 =2...Qe7= Another common continuation, especially at beginner level. Black defends the center pawn and simultaneously guards the f7-pawn with a simple queen move. After 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Qd1 Nc6, Black may be slightly ahead in development, but the queen remains blocking their crucial kingside bishop, producing a roughly equal position. FIDE Master Vinay Matta once played this defense during a 2017 match against Nguyen Dat in the 28th Czech Open, scoring a draw with roughly equal gameplay.https://www.365chess.com/tournaments/28th_Czech_Open_A_2017_2017/42166 See also * List of chess openings References External links *Jake, Joe and Garry (column by Hans Ree) *Nakamura-Sasikiran, Sigeman 2005 *Article on Parham in Indianapolis paper 2007 *Games with the Danvers Opening on ChessGames.com Category:Chess openings ","title":"Danvers Opening"},{"id":"2181236","text":"A Sidewalk Astronomer is a 2005 documentary film about former Vedanta monk and amateur astronomer John Dobson.

It is heard as far east as Lowell, Michigan, as far north as Grant, Michigan, and as far south as Kalamazoo, Michigan History Originally a country music station, its original call letters were WZND (which referred to city of license Zeeland, Michigan), until Lanser Broadcasting purchased the station and changed them to WJQK in January 1987. The studios were moved into the same Holland, Michigan building as sister station WWJQ (now WPNW) but the transmitting tower remained in Zeeland along Interstate 196 near the 96th Avenue overpass until the early 1990s when it was moved three miles east to where 72nd Avenue would cross the highway. During the 1980s and 1990s, the station (and its AM sister) promoted themselves as WJQ. JQ99 In 1997, the logo and nickname were changed to reflect the new moniker \\"JQ 99\\". A New Christian Hot AC/CHR format was introduced as well. 2005 saw the tagline of \\"Today's Best Christian Music\\" replaced by \\"Positive Hits\\" as well as the move of the business office and studio from Holland to Zeeland. Relaunch as JQ99.3 At midnight on April 8, 2013, JQ99 relaunched as JQ99.3 after a full hour of stunting with old JQ99 jingles and liners. After that, the station started the launch by airing a 2.5 minute liner all about the old station, and telling listeners about the new rebrand, after which the new Toth was fired up, and the first song, Let My Words Be Few by Phillips, Craig and Dean. The last song played under the JQ brand was Blessed by Rachael Lampa. The new rebrand now plays music from 2000‚Äìpresent. The new slogan is Energetic Positive Music, replacing Connected and growing from their previous JQ99 name. On May 1, 2013 the slogan was changed from Energetic Positive Music to Your Faith, Your Music. JQ99.3 was a reporter to Mediabase 24/7's Christian Adult Contemporary panel, until August 15, 2016. 99-3 JQK At midnight on August 15, 2016 WJQK changed to Christian CHR as 99-3 JQK, GR's Positive Hits And Hip Hop, With the first song being Britt Nicole's \\"Ready or Not\\" featuring Lecrae. This is JQ's second attempt at Christian CHR, and the second time using Saint John as the imaging voice though he would be replaced with Josh Ashton and a new female voice by January 2017. The station also uses the B96 jingle package produced by Reelworld. Back To JQ99.3 On January 1, 2018, with Chad Ericason as the new imaging voice, the new sound of JQ99.3 was launched. The station is once again a Christian CHR/Hot AC hybrid format just like 1997, with songs from 1990 until now, although the station is more current based rather than recurrents being heavily played. JQ99.3 is now a reporter to the Christian Hot AC bannal from Mediabase for the first time in its history. Joy 99 In late 2018, JQ 99.3 performed another rebranding, this time as \\"Joy 99.3\\". The rebrand included a new jingle package with a female lead. Other stations Lanser Broadcasting also owns WPNW. 99-3 JQK is a sponsor of the annual Unity Christian Music Festival.

The books were destined for young readers and feature a female superhero named Fant√¥mette. It was published in the \\"Biblioth√®que rose\\" series from Hachette Editions. Fantomette's alter ego, Fran√ßoise Dupont, is a girl of about twelve years who dresses up in order to fight crime. She has two sidekicks: Ficelle, a tall and not-very-bright blonde, and Boulotte, a short and chubby brunette who is fixated on food. Neither of them are aware of her secret identity, despite meeting Fant√¥mette regularly. Fant√¥mette was the first female superhero in French literature. The Fant√¥mette books were aimed at eight- to twelve-year-old girls. There are 52 books in the series, which is still published today, as well as a comic book series by Fran√ßois Craenhals, a 1993 live-action TV series starring Katia Sourzac, and a cartoon series in 1998. In 1957, the author, Georges Chaulet (1931‚Äì2012), proposed his first series, Les 4 As au coll√®ge, to Hachette, one of the biggest French publishers. But Hachette refused, having just bought the rights to all of Enid Blyton's novels, most notably The Famous Five. It was finally Casterman, a French- Belgian publisher, that published it. Very quickly, Les 4 As au coll√®ge was adapted as a comic book. Strengthened by this first success, George Chaulet then proposed a new series to Hachette, this time accepted: Fant√¥mette was born. Forty-nine volumes were then published from 1961 to 1987 in the Biblioth√®que rose series. In 2006, to celebrate the 150 years of the Biblioth√®que rose and after an eighteen-year absence, Georges Chaulet wrote a new adventure for his favorite heroine: Le Retour de Fant√¥mette. He died on 13 October 2012, having written more than one hundred fifty books for youth in the course of his career.

It uses the characters from the novel in original new adventures. The series was first aired on the French channels France 3 and Canal J on 20 April 1993. * Title: Fant√¥mette * Realisation: Christiane Spiero, Marco Pauly, Christiane Leh√©rissey * Scenery: based on the Fant√¥mette of Georges Chaulet * D√©cors: Patrick Corrand, Christian Siret, Patrick Bocquet * Photography: Jean-Claude Hugon * Production: Les Films du 3e √©tage, France 3, M√©diterran√©e Films Productions, IMA Productions * Country: France * Language: French * Number of episodes: 21 (2 seasons) * Length of episodes: 24 minutes * Date of first airing: 20 April 1993 =Cartoon= An animated series of 26 episodes of 25 minutes each was produced in 1999. The settings are drastically different from the ones of the novels. The action takes place in an international metropolis named Furtive-Ville instead of the small fictive French city of Framboisy. The young characters have families, sometimes parents in the animated series when they had none and lived independently in the novels. (For example, ≈íil-de-Lynx becomes Ficelle and Boulotte's brother whereas in the books, there was absolutely no family bond between them at all). Fran√ßoise is even given a particularly dramatic family past (dead Egyptologists for parents), something that does not exist in the books. Boulotte lose her obsession with food, having instead a passion for animals, while Ficelle appear much more intelligent than in the novels. As far as graphism goes, the Fant√¥mette of the animated series is heavily influenced by the American animated series of the time such as Batman. =Comic books= A series of comic books following the original scenarios of Georges Chaulet was published from 1982 to 1985 for a total of four albums, drawn by Fran√ßois Craenhals for the first three albums and Endry for the last one. # Fant√¥mette se d√©cha√Æne, Hachette, May 1982 # Fantomette livre bataille, Hachette, September 1982 # Fant√¥mette risque tout, Hachette, March 1983 # Fant√¥mette fend les flots, Hachette, January 1985 Miscellaneous *Fant√¥mette appears at the end of the film La Femme invisible (2009), by Agathe Teyssier, played by Jeanne Balibar. *In the French animated series Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir, the school that protagonists Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste attend is named Fran√ßoise Dupont.

The season produced eleven tropical cyclones, of which all eleven became tropical storms; six became hurricanes, and four of those strengthened into major hurricanes. The season's first storm developed on June 15 while the last storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 14\\\\. The most notable storm during the season formed in late August, while east of the Lesser Antilles. The hurricane devastated the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles, and Mexico, leaving around 4,000 fatalities and more than $50 million (1909 USD) in damage. The 1909 season was very deadly and destructive, featuring at least 4,673 fatalities, and $77.3 million, mostly due to the sixth and eighth hurricanes of the season. In mid-July, the fourth storm of the season hit Freeport, Texas, as a Category 3 hurricane, killing 41 people, and causing $2 million in damage. In mid-September, the eighth storm of the season made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, as a Category 3 hurricane, killing at least 350 people and causing $10 million in damage. The storm's storm surge is responsible for destroying thousands of homes, as it penetrated inland. In mid-October, the eleventh storm of the season developed, and tracked across Cuba, the Florida Keys, and the Bahamas as a Category 3 hurricane. At least $2 million in damage was caused, and at least 22 deaths were recorded. Lastly, the final storm of the season struck eastern Jamaica and Hispaniola as a hurricane before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone northeast of the Bahamas. The storm killed 198 people, and caused $7 million in damage.

The month of June featured two other storms. One cyclone formed in July, the Velasco hurricane. August was the most active month, with four storms, including the Monterrey hurricane. There were two systems in September. The former, the Grand Isle hurricane, was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . October and November each featured one storm, the Florida Keys hurricane and the Greater Antilles hurricane, respectively. The twelfth and final cyclone of the season, the Greater Antilles hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles on November 14\\\\. The season had a total of 12 tropical storms, 6 of which intensified into a hurricane. This was the most tropical storms in a season since the total of thirteen in 1901. The reanalysis from Christopher Landsea et al. in 2011 resulted in the addition of two tropical storms, which are listed as the first and seventh storms. In 1999, Jos√© F. Partag√°s and Henry F. Diaz uncovered evidence confirming the existence of a tropical system in November,Partag√°s, pp. 21 while Landsea et al. upgraded the system from a tropical storm to a Category 2 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Additionally, the second storm of the second was also upgraded to a hurricane, increasing the number of landfalling hurricanes in the United States to five, the most in a season since 1893. All of the season's 12 tropical cyclones made landfall. Collectively, the storms caused over $77.3 million in damage and at least 4,673 fatalities.      The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 93. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. Systems =Tropical Storm One= The first tropical cyclone of the season was first identified as a tropical depression near the southeastern Nicaragua coastline on June 15\\\\. Tracking due north, the depression intensified into a tropical storm within 12 hours. Operationally, this system was not classified as a tropical storm as there was uncertainty of tropical storm-force winds being measured.Partag√°s, pp. 22 Maintaining a slow, northward movement, the system attained peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). On June 18, it gradually turned towards the west, leading to the storm making landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, the following morning. Once overland, the storm weakened, first to a tropical depression before dissipating near the Nicaragua-Honduras border during the evening of June 19\\\\. Due to the weak nature of the system, little information was recorded on it. Throughout its existence, ships in the region suggested a minimum pressure of 1009 mbar (hPa; 29.80 inHg). =Hurricane Two= In late June, the season's second tropical cyclone developed near the Florida Keys.Partag√°s, pp. 1 Its origins are unknown and the first indications of the system were as a tropical storm. After tracking northwest towards Louisiana for about a day. The system sharply changed direction and took a direct path towards the south Texas coastline. By June 29, it was estimated that the storm intensified into a minimal hurricane, attaining winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). However, reanalysis on the storm by Partag√°s in 1999 indicated that it was only a tropical storm. Shortly before the hurricane made landfall near Brownsville, Texas, it attained its peak intensity as a modern-day Category 2 cyclone with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). A barometric pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.70 inHg) was recorded as the storm moved inland. By June 30, the system weakened to a tropical storm and crossed into northern Mexico; the cyclone dissipated several hours later. Upon making landfall, the hurricane brought a storm surge exceeding , inundating low-lying coastal areas such as Padre Island. Winds up to were recorded as far north as Corpus Christi; however, no known winds were measured where the system made landfall. During a 24‚Äëhour span, of rain fell in Mercedes, Texas. These heavy rains resulted in substantial flooding along the Rio Grande over the following week. Near Brownsville, a town in Mexico was mostly flooded after the river broke its banks on July 4\\\\. Floods persisted in the country through July 10, leaving behind substantial damage. Though no loss of life took place, total losses from the hurricane reached $1.3 million, almost all of which was attributed to destroyed railroads in Mexico. =Tropical Storm Three= A tropical depression developed near Turks and Caicos Islands on June 26\\\\. Moving west- northwestward, the depression struck Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas. By 12:00 UTC the following day, the storm curved northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm. While situated near Andros around 12:00 UTC on June 28, the cyclone peaked with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). About eight hours later, it made landfall near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Cedar Key early on June 30, before making landfall near St. Marks close to 14:00 UTC with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Although the system quickly weakened to a tropical depression, it remained a tropical cyclone while moving in a semicircular path across the Southeastern United States. Early on July 3, the storm emerged into the Atlantic near Beaufort, South Carolina. Around this time, Charleston observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest in relation to the system.Partag√°s, pp. 2 The storm moved east- southeastward and continued weakening, until dissipating between Bermuda and Grand Bahama late on July 4\\\\. In Florida, the storm brought heavy rainfall to some areas. There was standing water on the streets of Bartow and Lakeland. In Tampa, winds exceeding shattered some windows. There was also \\"considerable\\" impact to crops and telegraph and telephone wires. Along the coast, several small crafts were damaged.Partag√°s, pp. 2 =Hurricane Four= The Velasco Hurricane of 1909 A tropical depression was first noted in close proximity to the Windward Islands on July 13\\\\. Remaining weak for the next few days, the system began to intensify after nearing Jamaica on July 17, when it became a tropical storm. Curving towards the northwest, the cyclone reached hurricane strength on July 18 near the western tip of Cuba. Intensification halted as it moved westwards across the Gulf of Mexico, but resumed as the hurricane approached the Texas coast. The storm deepened into a Category 3 hurricane on July 21 and subsequently reached its peak intensity with winds of . Shortly thereafter, the hurricane made landfall near Velasco, Texas. Once over land, the system began to quickly weaken, and dissipated near the Rio Grande on July 22\\\\. In Cuba, the storm brought rough seas, strong winds, and persistently heavy rainfall over a period of two days, inundating the streets of Bataban√≥ with about of water. A number of vessels also sank, but no fatalities occurred.Partag√°s, pp. 4 In Texas, strong waves caused several offshore shipping incidents, and storm surge inundated areas of the Texas coast, though damage in Galveston was mostly mitigated by the Galveston Seawall.Ellis, pp. 102 In Velasco, one of the hardest hit cities, only eight buildings remained intact after the hurricane. Strong winds forced train closures and destroyed and downed various infrastructure. Heavy rains further inland peaked at 8.5 in (220 mm) in Hallettsville. The hurricane caused 41 deaths and $2 million in damages in Texas. =Tropical Storm Five= On August 6, a new tropical depression was identified between Jamaica and Honduras. Tracking northwestward, the system gradually intensified, attaining tropical storm status near the Cayman Islands later that day. On August 7, the storm turned towards the west and reached its peak intensity just off the coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a pressure of 1004 mbar (hPa; 29.65 inHg). Hours later, the cyclone made landfall near Canc√∫n and weakened to a tropical depression hours later. Continuing westward, the system moved back over water on August 9, over the Bay of Campeche. Within hours of doing so, it re-attained tropical storm status as its forward motion quickly increased. During the afternoon of August 10, the storm made its final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, before rapidly dissipating over the mountainous terrain of Mexico later that day. =Hurricane Six= The Monterrey Hurricane of 1909 Originating from a tropical storm east of the Leeward Islands on August 20, the storm tracked west-northwest, entering the Caribbean Sea as a minimal hurricane the next day. After striking Hispaniola on August 23, the hurricane made another landfall in eastern Cuba before reentering the Caribbean. Once back over open water, the storm intensified into a Category 3 hurricane and moved across the northern tip of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. By August 26, the storm had emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a weakened but regrouping system. It attained its peak winds of 120 mph (185 km/h) that evening. Maintaining this intensity, the system made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas late on August 27 and rapidly dissipated the following afternoon. Throughout its existence, the hurricane remained relatively close to land, so consequently it effected many areas of the northern Caribbean Sea. Although the storm impacted several islands, only Haiti reported damage during the hurricane's passage.Partag√°s, pp. 7Partag√°s, pp. 8 In northeastern Mexico, catastrophic flooding occurred due to the storm, especially in the city of Monterrey. In that city, more than half of the structures were flooded, hundreds were destroyed,. and 20,000 people were left homeless. Throughout Mexico, reports indicated that 4,000 people were killed by the hurricane, making it the tenth deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record. Monetary losses were also estimated to have exceeded $50 million. =Tropical Storm Seven= A low pressure area formed over the central Gulf of Mexico between August 19 and August 20\\\\. Ships and weather maps indicate that a tropical depression developed from the low to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba at 00:00 UTC on August 22. The system moved northwestward and intensified into a tropical storm about 24 hours later. By 12:00 UTC on August 23, sustained winds were estimated to have peaked at 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm began curving to the west-southwest shortly thereafter. Late on August 24, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression while approaching the coast of Mexico, with the weakening probably caused by wind shear generated by the sixth storm. The cyclone made landfall in northern Tamaulipas near the United States border early the following day, and promptly dissipated. The highest wind speed observed on land was in New Orleans. =Tropical Storm Eight= A ship first indicated the presence of this storm about 60 mi (95 km) northeast of Samana Cay in the Bahamas on August 28.Partag√°s, pp. 9 The cyclone moved west-northwestward and struck the southern end of Abaco Islands later that day. Early on August 9, the storm is estimated to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), based on a minimum barometric pressure of observed by a ship.Partag√°s, pp. 10 The cyclone made landfall around 09:00 UTC near modern-day Boca Raton, Florida. Moving inland, the system weakened to a tropical depression early on August 30 while just to the west of Lake Okeechobee, where it began curving northwestward. Around midday, the cyclone turned northeastward. Late on August 30, the storm reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean and restrengthened into a tropical storm early the following day. The reintensification was short-lived, with the cyclone weakening to a tropical depression and dissipating about southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. =Hurricane Nine= The Grand Isle Hurricane of 1909 During early September, a tropical disturbance over the western Atlantic began to strengthen as it moved towards the Lesser Antilles. By September 13, the system had become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression. Moving west-northwestward, the depression attained tropical storm status near Jamaica on September 15 and hurricane intensity the following day. By September 18, the hurricane had attained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) as it moved over the western tip of Cuba. After briefly weakening due to its interaction with land, the storm re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, attaining winds of 120 mph (185 km/h), becoming the third major hurricane of the season. Maintaining this strength, the storm eventually made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, on September 21\\\\. Rapid weakening took place as it quickly moved northward, dissipating the following day over Missouri. In western Cuba, the storm brought strong winds and heavy precipitation to several areas. Numerous buildings suffered severe damage and a large portion of the orange crop was lost. Ships were pushed onshore by the hurricane's large swells.Partag√°s, pp. 11 Throughout Pinar del R√≠o Province, damage was estimated at about $1 million. The steamship Nicholas Castina capsized near Isla de la Juventud, drowning at least 29 people. In the United States, the hurricane killed at least 350 people and wrought $10 million in damage. Thousands of homes were destroyed by the cyclone's powerful storm surge which penetrated inland. The states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama sustained the most severe damage, especially from strong winds which covered a large area. =Tropical Storm Ten= Observations from a ship and weather maps indicate that a tropical depression developed near the north coast of Isla de la Juventud on September 24.Partag√°s, pp. 14 Moving northward, the depression soon struck the Caribbean coast of modern-day Artemisa Province in Cuba. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds were reported in the now defunct Santa Clara Province.Partag√°s, pp. 15 The depression emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and failed to intensify further before making landfall near Naples, Florida late on September 25\\\\. Moving northeastward, the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC on September 26\\\\. About 24 hours later, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Thereafter, the storm began weakening. However, on September 28, a ship observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest known in relation to the storm. Around 00:00 UTC on September 29, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression just west of Bermuda and dissipated shortly thereafter. =Hurricane Eleven= Key West Hurricane of 1909 The storm was first detected in the Caribbean about 35 mi (55 km) northwest of Cartagena, Colombia, on October 6\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, the system became a tropical storm early on the next day while heading northwestward. By October 8, the storm became a Category 1 hurricane to the southwest of Jamaica. The hurricane curved west-northwestward and intensified throughout the next day, becoming Category 3 intensity late on October 9\\\\. The cyclone peaked with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) early on October 10\\\\. Later that day, it turned to the north and made landfall in Sandino, Pinar del R√≠o Province. After traversing the western extremity of Cuba, the storm entered the Straights of Florida and turned northeastward. The hurricane made landfall near Marathon, Florida, late on October 11 with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Thereafter, the system weakened quickly while crossing the northwestern Bahamas and the western Atlantic, falling to tropical storm intensity late on October 12\\\\. About 24 hours later, it weakened to a tropical depression and then dissipated 200 mi (320 km) northeast of Bermuda. In western Cuba, strong winds and large waves left severe damage. The cities of Cayuco and La Fe in Pinar del R√≠o Province were completely destroyed, while Guane experienced considerable devastation and every house in Puerto Esperanza suffered damage due to strong winds.Partag√°s, pp. 16 In Havana alone, the storm caused five fatalities and about $1 million in damage. The large waves reached the coast of Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula, causing many fishermen and their families to drown.Partag√°s, pp. 17 In Key West, the streets became a \\"mess of wreckage\\", with at least 500 homes were destroyed and at least 400 buildings throughout the city being damaged or demolished. Overall, damage in Key West reached approximately $2 million and there were two fatal injuries. Worst damage in Key West since 1870 hurricanes. Damage to Keys railroad not as great as the similar 1906 hurricane storm.http://www.keyshistory.org/hurricanelist.html At several locations in the Florida Keys, the Florida East Coast Railway was damaged. Twelve deaths occurred at Bahia Honda Key after the tugboat Sybil wrecked there. In Marathon, the timekeeper drowned. In Miami, a number of structures were deroofed, while the newly built hotel suffered severe damage, but impact otherwise primarily limited to downed trees. Along its path, the storm killed 34 people. =Hurricane Twelve= The final storm of the season formed from a large weather system over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 8. Tracking northwestward, the system gradually intensified. On November 11, the storm brushed the eastern tip of Jamaica before attaining hurricane-status several hours later. During the afternoon of November 12, the hurricane made landfall in northeastern Haiti with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) before entering the Atlantic Ocean. Once in the Atlantic, the storm further intensified to attain peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on November 13 as it accelerated eastward. The system rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the following day before being absorbed by a frontal system northeast of the Lesser Antilles.Partag√°s, pp. 20 In Jamaica, torrential rains from the storm, peaking at at Silver Hill Plantation, wrought widespread damage. Throughout the country, roughly 500,000 banana plants were lost as a result of the floods, about 20% of the entire country's yield.Partag√°s, pp. 22 The storm left 30 people dead and $7 million in damage. Nearby Haiti suffered more severe losses from the storm, with 166 people confirmed to have died and hundreds other presumed dead. Additionally, damage reached at least $3 million.

He was also known as Grand Mouravi (·Éì·Éò·Éì·Éò ·Éõ·Éù·É£·É†·Éê·Éï·Éò, didi mouravi) in Georgia, M≈´rƒÅv-Beg in Persia and MƒÅ≈´rƒÅv-H≈´n or MƒÅƒ°rƒÅv-Bek in the Ottoman Empire for having served as a mouravi (appointed royal official which can be rendered by seneschal or bailiff) of Tbilisi.  Biography  Giorgi Saakagze was born in 1570 in Noste village (Peli village by other sources), near the town on Kaspi. Saakadze's family came of the untitled nobility (samepo aznauri). His father, Siaush, rose in prominence through a loyal service to King Simon I of Kartli, whom Giorgi joined in military service in his early career. Under the young king Luarsab II, he was appointed a mourav of Tbilisi, Tskhinvali, and Dvaleti in 1608. Saakadze's influence and prestige especially grew after he destroyed an Ottoman invasion force at the battle of Tashiskari in June 1609, thereby saving Luarsab from being dislodged. In 1611, the king married Saakadze's sister, Macrine, annoying the great nobles, who grew increasingly suspicious of the ambitious and aspiring officer who had had risen from the ranks of the petty nobility to become the most powerful man in Kartli. The animosity between the two nobles parties centered on the princes P‚Äôarsadan Tsitsishvili and Shadiman Baratashvili on one hand, and Saakadze on the other. The nobles convinced Luarsab that Saakadze was an Iranian traitor, prompting him to divorce Macrine and authorize a plot to kill him in May 1612. Saakadze escaped the trap and defected to Iran. Having converted to Islam and displayed his military ability in Iran's war with the Ottomans, he quickly won the confidence of Shah Abbas I of Iran and was regularly consulted on the Georgian affairs.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, pp. 50-51. Indiana University Press, .Hitchins, Keith. Georgia II: History of Iranian-Georgian relations. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Online Edition. Accessed on October 25, 2007. In 1614, Saakadze avenged Luarsab and his nobles by aiding Shah Abbas in the invasion of Georgia which brought Luarsab's reign to an end, but dissuaded the Iranians from committing atrocities in Kartli after the nation surrendered. In 1619, the shah appointed him a vekil (regent) to Bagrat Khan, the Iranian nominee to the throne of Kartli. Saakadze turned into a de facto ruler of Kartli. Once the hostilities with the Ottomans resumed, Saakadze served as one of the leading commanders in the shah's ranks from 1621 to 1623. His military exploits led Abbas to appoint him to the staff of Qarachaqay Khan who led a 35,000-strong army to crush the rebellion in Georgia. Saakadze then discovered that the Shah planned to massacre all armed Kartlians, including himself. He conspired with the rebel leaders ‚Äì his brother-in-law Zurab of Aragvi and king Teimuraz I of Kakheti ‚Äì and ambushed the Iranian army at Martqopi on March 25, 1625, inflicting a decisive defeat on it. Saakadze went on to annihilate the Turkic nomads transplanted by the Iranian government to replace the exiled Georgian population, dislodged the shah's governor Paykar Khan from Kakheti and raided the Iranian garrisons as far as Ganja and Karabakh. In an act of revenge, Shah Abbas put Saakadze's younger son, Paata, to death, and sent his severed head to the Georgians. The punitive Iranian expedition followed soon thereafter, and won a costly victory over the Georgians at the Battle of Marabda. Saakadze withdrew into the mountains, and organized a powerful guerrilla resistance which forced Abbas I to recognize Teimuraz's royal status. The unity of Georgian nobles quickly collapsed, however. Saakadze's opposition to Teimuraz's control of Kartli led to a bitter conflict which culminated in the fratricidal battle of Bazaleti in the fall of 1626. The royal army won a victory, driving Saakadze into exile to Istanbul where he entered the service of Sultan Ibrahim I. He briefly served as a governor of the Konya Vilayet and fought against the Iranians at Erzurum (1627-1628), and in Meskheti (1628). However, Grand Vizier Ekrem H√ºsrev Pasha soon accused Saakadze of treason and had him, along with his son Avtandil, Kaikhosro, Prince of Mukhrani, and other Georgians, put to death at Constantinople on October 3, 1629. Saakadze's last surviving son, Ioram, later attained to the princely rank in Georgia, and founded the Tarkhan-Mouravi noble family.  In culture  The Giorgi Saakadze statue by Merab Berdzenishvili in Saakadze Square in Tbilisi, Georgia. Saakadze's controversial career has always been a source of conflicting perceptions of his role in Georgia's history. The traditional historiography of Georgia, heavily influenced by Prince Vakhushti and Marie Brosset, continued to view him as a feudal adventurer and ambitious warlord involved in the turbulent whirl of intrigues and disturbances which fill the history of seventeenth- century Georgia. The first attempt at the rehabilitation of Saakadze was made by his relative Metropolitan Joseph of Tbilisi in his poem The Grand Mouravi (·Éì·Éò·Éì·Éõ·Éù·É£·É†·Éê·Éï·Éò·Éê·Éú·Éò, didmouraviani; 1681‚Äì87). Beginning from the early 20th century, some Georgian authors have also tried to emphasize the positive aspects of Saakadze's biography, particularly his contribution to the 1625 rebellion which frustrated Shah Abbas's plan to convert eastern Georgian lands into the Qizilbash khanates. Baramidze, Alexander (ed., 1966). \\"·Éì·Éò·Éì·Éõ·Éù·É£·É†·Éê·Éï·Éò·Éê·Éú·Éò\\" (The Grand Mouravi) in: ·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·É£·Éö·Éò ·Éö·Éò·É¢·Éî·É†·Éê·É¢·É£·É†·Éò·É° ·Éò·É°·É¢·Éù·É†·Éò·Éê (History of Georgian Literature). Tbilisi: Sabchota Sakartvelo. In the 1940s, Joseph Stalin‚Äôs wartime propaganda established Saakadze as a major symbol of Georgian patriotism. In October 1940, Stalin commented on Saakadze, proclaiming that the Grand Mouravi‚Äôs hopes for Georgia‚Äôs \\"unification into one state through the establishment of royal absolutism and of the liquidation of the power of the princes\\" had been progressive.Ree, Erik van (2002), The Political Thought of Joseph Stalin: A Study in 20th Century Revolutionary Patriotism, p. 304. Routledge, . In an apparent move to encourage Georgian nationalism in order to gain the loyalty of the population during the war with Germany, Stalin himself was involved in modifying the script for an epic movie, Giorgi Saakadze, commissioned from the Georgian film director Mikheil Chiaureli in 1942-1943.Stites, Richard (1995), Culture and Entertainment in Wartime Russia, p. 171. Indiana University Press, . Stalin dismissed a script by the Georgian writer Giorgi Leonidze and approved the one by Anna Antonovskaya and Boris Chenry, adopted from Antonovskaya's 1942 Stalin Prize-winning six-volume novel, The Great Mouravi ().Dobrenko, Evgeny (2008), Stalinist Cinema and the Production of History, p. 42. Stalinist Cinema and the Production of History: Museum of the Revolution. Edinburgh University Press, . The film emphasized that Saakadze, initially an obscure squire, was a victim of machinations at the hands of the wealthy feudal lords who would sacrifice everything, including their motherland, for their own benefit. It intentionally avoided any mention of Saakadze's own adventures and illustrated him as a popular leader against the external aggressors. In the atmosphere of suspicion and spy mania in the Soviet Union during these years, the movie also served to current propaganda by emphasizing that the treason threatening to the popular leader, and hence to the country, was to be punished cruelly.Shlapentokh, Vladimir, and Chliapentokh, Dmitry (1993), Soviet Cinematography, 1918-1991: Ideological Conflict and Social Reality, pp. 74-75, 81. Aldine Transaction, .

Phadkar was an attacking middle order batsman, a medium pace bowler who could swing the ball both ways and extract life from the wicket, and usually fielded in the slips. He was one of the cricketing heart-throbs of his day. Phadkar was educated in Bombay in the Robert Money High School and took a B.A. degree from Elphinstone College. At the age of 10, he scored 156 in an inter-school match. He represented Bombay University at cricket between 1941/42 and 1946/47. On his collegiate debut, he hit 274, which was then a record. He underwent training at Alf Gover's cricket school. Picked for the Indian tour of Australia in 1947/48, Phadkar shone more with the bat than the ball. On his debut on a difficult wicket at Sydney he hit 51 while batting at eight and took 3 for 14. Promoted to No.6, he scored 123 at Adelaide and added a record 188 for the sixth wicket with Vijay Hazare. Phadkar went on to top the batting averages and scored at least a fifty in all the four Tests that he played. Next year against West Indies at Madras, Phadkar took 7 for 159 which remained his best figures in Tests. But his efforts at bowling bouncers in this match led to the West Indian bowlers reacting in kind and the defeat of India. In the exciting last Test where India needed 361 and ended up six runs short, Phadkar hit 37 not out. His other major innings was 115 against England in 1951/52. When India lost disastrously in England in 1952, he was one of the few players to come out with some credit. At Headingley where India lost the first four wickets before scoring a run, Phadkar and Hazare added 105 for the sixth wicket. Phadkar played in 13 unofficial Tests. He played all the ten Tests against the touring Commonwealth teams in 1949/50 and 1950/51. In the former series where India used four captains, Phadkar led the team in the final Test. He made his first class debut at the age of 17 and went on to captain Bombay in 1950/51. Against Maharashtra in 1948/49 - a match in which 2376 runs were scored - he hit 131 and 160, and took 3/142 and 3/168.Maharashtra v Bombay 1948-49 His highest first class score was 217 scored against Maharashtra in 1950/51 out of a Bombay total of 725 for 8.Bombay v Maharashtra 1950-51 He played in the Lancashire League for Nelson, and for Rochdale in the Central Lancashire League. He was a national selector in the 1970s. MCC made him a life member in 1968. He worked for Tata & Sons in Bombay and also for the Railways. Suhas Phadkar, Dattu's brother's son, later played cricket for Vidarbha and captained the team in 1980s. After retirement he ran a kindergarten school with his wife in Behala, Calcutta, called Sunny Preparatory School. His death was due to a brain illness.

Other modern axiomizations of Euclidean geometry are Hilbert's axioms and Birkhoff's axioms. Overview Early in his career Tarski taught geometry and researched set theory. His coworker Steven Givant (1999) explained Tarski's take-off point: :From Enriques, Tarski learned of the work of Mario Pieri, an Italian geometer who was strongly influenced by Peano. Tarski preferred Pieri's system [of his Point and Sphere memoir], where the logical structure and the complexity of the axioms were more transparent. Givant then says that \\"with typical thoroughness\\" Tarski devised his system: :What was different about Tarski's approach to geometry? First of all, the axiom system was much simpler than any of the axiom systems that existed up to that time. In fact the length of all of Tarski's axioms together is not much more than just one of Pieri's 24 axioms. It was the first system of Euclidean geometry that was simple enough for all axioms to be expressed in terms of the primitive notions only, without the help of defined notions. Of even greater importance, for the first time a clear distinction was made between full geometry and its elementary ‚Äî that is, its first order ‚Äî part. Like other modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry, Tarski's employs a formal system consisting of symbol strings, called sentences, whose construction respects formal syntactical rules, and rules of proof that determine the allowed manipulations of the sentences. Unlike some other modern axiomatizations, such as Birkhoff's and Hilbert's, Tarski's axiomatization has no primitive objects other than points, so a variable or constant cannot refer to a line or an angle. Because points are the only primitive objects, and because Tarski's system is a first-order theory, it is not even possible to define lines as sets of points. The only primitive relations (predicates) are \\"betweenness\\" and \\"congruence\\" among points. Tarski's axiomatization is shorter than its rivals, in a sense Tarski and Givant (1999) make explicit. It is more concise than Pieri's because Pieri had only two primitive notions while Tarski introduced three: point, betweenness, and congruence. Such economy of primitive and defined notions means that Tarski's system is not very convenient for doing Euclidean geometry. Rather, Tarski designed his system to facilitate its analysis via the tools of mathematical logic, i.e., to facilitate deriving its metamathematical properties. Tarski's system has the unusual property that all sentences can be written in universal-existential form, a special case of the prenex normal form. This form has all universal quantifiers preceding any existential quantifiers, so that all sentences can be recast in the form \\\\forall u \\\\forall v \\\\ldots\\\\exists a \\\\exists b\\\\dots. This fact allowed Tarski to prove that Euclidean geometry is decidable: there exists an algorithm which can determine the truth or falsity of any sentence. Tarski's axiomatization is also complete. This does not contradict G√∂del's first incompleteness theorem, because Tarski's theory lacks the expressive power needed to interpret Robinson arithmetic .  The axioms  Alfred Tarski worked on the axiomatization and metamathematics of Euclidean geometry intermittently from 1926 until his death in 1983, with Tarski (1959) heralding his mature interest in the subject. The work of Tarski and his students on Euclidean geometry culminated in the monograph Schwabh√§user, Szmielew, and Tarski (1983), which set out the 10 axioms and one axiom schema shown below, the associated metamathematics, and a fair bit of the subject. Gupta (1965) made important contributions, and Tarski and Givant (1999) discuss the history. = Fundamental relations = These axioms are a more elegant version of a set Tarski devised in the 1920s as part of his investigation of the metamathematical properties of Euclidean plane geometry. This objective required reformulating that geometry as a first-order theory. Tarski did so by positing a universe of points, with lower case letters denoting variables ranging over that universe. Equality is provided by the underlying logic (see First-order logic#Equality and its axioms).Tarski and Givant, 1999, page 177 Tarski then posited two primitive relations: * Betweenness, a triadic relation. The atomic sentence Bxyz denotes that y is \\"between\\" x and z, in other words, that y is a point on the line segment xz. (This relation is interpreted inclusively, so that Bxyz is trivially true whenever x=y or y=z). * Congruence (or \\"equidistance\\"), a tetradic relation. The atomic sentence wx ‚â° yz can be interpreted as wx is congruent to yz, in other words, that the length of the line segment wx is equal to the length of the line segment yz. Betweenness captures the affine aspect of Euclidean geometry; congruence, its metric aspect. The background logic includes identity, a binary relation. The axioms invoke identity (or its negation) on five occasions. The axioms below are grouped by the types of relation they invoke, then sorted, first by the number of existential quantifiers, then by the number of atomic sentences. The axioms should be read as universal closures; hence any free variables should be taken as tacitly universally quantified. = Congruence axioms = ; Reflexivity of Congruence: : xy \\\\equiv yx\\\\,. ; Identity of Congruence: : xy \\\\equiv zz \\\\rightarrow x=y. ; Transitivity of Congruence: : (xy \\\\equiv zu \\\\land xy \\\\equiv vw) \\\\rightarrow zu \\\\equiv vw. Commentary While the congruence relation xy \\\\equiv zw is, formally, a 4-way relation among points, it may also be thought of, informally, as a binary relation between two line segments xy and zw. The \\"Reflexivity\\" and \\"Transitivity\\" axioms above, combined, prove both: * that this binary relation is in fact an equivalence relation ** it is reflexive: xy \\\\equiv xy. ** it is symmetric xy \\\\equiv zw \\\\rightarrow zw \\\\equiv xy. ** it is transitive (xy \\\\equiv zu \\\\land zu \\\\equiv vw) \\\\rightarrow xy \\\\equiv vw. * and that the order in which the points of a line segment are specified is irrelevant. ** xy \\\\equiv zw \\\\rightarrow xy \\\\equiv wz. ** xy \\\\equiv zw \\\\rightarrow yx \\\\equiv zw. ** xy \\\\equiv zw \\\\rightarrow yx \\\\equiv wz. The \\"transitivity\\" axiom asserts that congruence is Euclidean, in that it respects the first of Euclid's \\"common notions\\". The \\"Identity of Congruence\\" axiom states, intuitively, that if xy is congruent with a segment that begins and ends at the same point, x and y are the same point. This is closely related to the notion of reflexivity for binary relations. = Betweenness axioms = Pasch's axiom ; Identity of Betweenness : Bxyx \\\\rightarrow x=y. The only point on the line segment xx is x itself. ; Axiom of Pasch : (Bxuz \\\\land Byvz) \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists a\\\\, (Buay \\\\land Bvax). Continuity: œÜ and œà divide the ray into two halves and the axiom asserts the existence of a point b dividing those two halves ; Axiom schema of Continuity Let œÜ(x) and œà(y) be first-order formulae containing no free instances of either a or b. Let there also be no free instances of x in œà(y) or of y in œÜ(x). Then all instances of the following schema are axioms: : \\\\exists a \\\\,\\\\forall x\\\\, \\\\forall y\\\\,[(\\\\phi(x) \\\\land \\\\psi(y)) \\\\rightarrow Baxy] \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists b\\\\, \\\\forall x\\\\, \\\\forall y\\\\,[(\\\\phi(x) \\\\land \\\\psi(y)) \\\\rightarrow Bxby]. Let r be a ray with endpoint a. Let the first order formulae œÜ and œà define subsets X and Y of r, such that every point in Y is to the right of every point of X (with respect to a). Then there exists a point b in r lying between X and Y. This is essentially the Dedekind cut construction, carried out in a way that avoids quantification over sets. ; Lower Dimension : \\\\exists a \\\\, \\\\exists b\\\\, \\\\exists c\\\\, [ eg Babc \\\\land eg Bbca \\\\land eg Bcab]. There exist three noncollinear points. Without this axiom, the theory could be modeled by the one-dimensional real line, a single point, or even the empty set. = Congruence and betweenness = Upper dimension ; Upper Dimension : (xu \\\\equiv xv \\\\land yu \\\\equiv yv \\\\land zu \\\\equiv zv \\\\land u e v) \\\\rightarrow (Bxyz \\\\lor Byzx \\\\lor Bzxy). Three points equidistant from two distinct points form a line. Without this axiom, the theory could be modeled by three-dimensional or higher-dimensional space. ; Axiom of Euclid Each of the three variants of this axiom, all equivalent over the remaining Tarski's axioms to Euclid's parallel postulate, has an advantage over the others: * A dispenses with existential quantifiers; * B has the fewest variables and atomic sentences; * C requires but one primitive notion, betweenness. This variant is the usual one given in the literature. : A: ((Bxyw \\\\land xy \\\\equiv yw ) \\\\land (Bxuv \\\\land xu \\\\equiv uv) \\\\land (Byuz \\\\land yu \\\\equiv zu)) \\\\rightarrow yz \\\\equiv vw. Let a line segment join the midpoint of two sides of a given triangle. That line segment will be half as long as the third side. This is equivalent to the interior angles of any triangle summing to two right angles. : B: Bxyz \\\\lor Byzx \\\\lor Bzxy \\\\lor \\\\exists a\\\\, (xa \\\\equiv ya \\\\land xa \\\\equiv za). Given any triangle, there exists a circle that includes all of its vertices. Axiom of Euclid: C : C: (Bxuv \\\\land Byuz \\\\land x e u) \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists a\\\\, \\\\exists b\\\\,(Bxya \\\\land Bxzb \\\\land Bavb). Given any angle and any point v in its interior, there exists a line segment including v, with an endpoint on each side of the angle. ; Five Segment Five segment :{(x e y \\\\land Bxyz \\\\land Bx'y'z' \\\\land xy \\\\equiv x'y' \\\\land yz \\\\equiv y'z' \\\\land xu \\\\equiv x'u' \\\\land yu \\\\equiv y'u')} \\\\rightarrow zu \\\\equiv z'u'. Begin with two triangles, xuz and x'u'z'. Draw the line segments yu and y'u', connecting a vertex of each triangle to a point on the side opposite to the vertex. The result is two divided triangles, each made up of five segments. If four segments of one triangle are each congruent to a segment in the other triangle, then the fifth segments in both triangles must be congruent. This is equivalent to the side-angle-side rule for determining that two triangles are congruent; if the angles uxz and u'x'z' are congruent (there exist congruent triangles xuz and x'u'z'), and the two pairs of incident sides are congruent (xu ‚â° x'u' and xz ‚â° x'z'), then the remaining pair of sides is also congruent (uz ‚â° u'z'). ; Segment Construction : \\\\exists z\\\\, [Bxyz \\\\land yz \\\\equiv ab]. For any point y, it is possible to draw in any direction (determined by x) a line congruent to any segment ab. Discussion Starting from two primitive relations whose fields are a dense universe of points, Tarski built a geometry of line segments. According to Tarski and Givant (1999: 192-93), none of the above axioms are fundamentally new. The first four axioms establish some elementary properties of the two primitive relations. For instance, Reflexivity and Transitivity of Congruence establish that congruence is an equivalence relation over line segments. The Identity of Congruence and of Betweenness govern the trivial case when those relations are applied to nondistinct points. The theorem xy‚â°zz ‚Üî x=y ‚Üî Bxyx extends these Identity axioms. A number of other properties of Betweenness are derivable as theorems including: *Reflexivity: Bxxy ; *Symmetry: Bxyz ‚Üí Bzyx ; *Transitivity: (Bxyw ‚àß Byzw) ‚Üí Bxyz ; *Connectivity: (Bxyw ‚àß Bxzw) ‚Üí (Bxyz ‚à® Bxzy). The last two properties totally order the points making up a line segment. Upper and Lower Dimension together require that any model of these axioms have a specific finite dimensionality. Suitable changes in these axioms yield axiom sets for Euclidean geometry for dimensions 0, 1, and greater than 2 (Tarski and Givant 1999: Axioms 8(1), 8(n), 9(0), 9(1), 9(n) ). Note that solid geometry requires no new axioms, unlike the case with Hilbert's axioms. Moreover, Lower Dimension for n dimensions is simply the negation of Upper Dimension for n - 1 dimensions. When the number of dimensions is greater than 1, Betweenness can be defined in terms of congruence (Tarski and Givant, 1999). First define the relation \\"‚â§\\" (where ab \\\\leq cd is interpreted \\"the length of line segment ab is less than or equal to the length of line segment cd\\"): :xy \\\\le zu \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\forall v ( zv \\\\equiv uv \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists w ( xw \\\\equiv yw \\\\land yw \\\\equiv uv ) ). In the case of two dimensions, the intuition is as follows: For any line segment xy, consider the possible range of lengths of xv, where v is any point on the perpendicular bisector of xy. It is apparent that while there is no upper bound to the length of xv, there is a lower bound, which occurs when v is the midpoint of xy. So if xy is shorter than or equal to zu, then the range of possible lengths of xv will be a superset of the range of possible lengths of zw, where w is any point on the perpendicular bisector of zu. Betweenness can then be defined by using the intuition that the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line: :Bxyz \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\forall u ( ( ux \\\\le xy \\\\land uz \\\\le zy ) \\\\rightarrow u = y ). The Axiom Schema of Continuity assures that the ordering of points on a line is complete (with respect to first-order definable properties). The Axioms of Pasch and Euclid are well known. Remarkably, Euclidean geometry requires just the following further axioms: * Segment Construction. This axiom makes measurement and the Cartesian coordinate system possible‚Äîsimply assign the value of 1 to some arbitrary non-empty line segment; Let wff stand for a well- formed formula (or syntactically correct formula) of elementary geometry. Tarski and Givant (1999: 175) proved that elementary geometry is: *Consistent: There is no wff such that it and its negation are both theorems; *Complete: Every sentence or its negation is a theorem provable from the axioms; *Decidable: There exists an algorithm that assigns a truth value to every sentence. This follows from Tarski's: ** Decision procedure for the real closed field, which he found by quantifier elimination (the Tarski‚ÄìSeidenberg theorem); **Axioms admitting of a (multi-dimensional) faithful interpretation as a real closed field. Gupta (1965) proved the above axioms independent, Pasch and Reflexivity of Congruence excepted. Negating the Axiom of Euclid yields hyperbolic geometry, while eliminating it outright yields absolute geometry. Full (as opposed to elementary) Euclidean geometry requires giving up a first order axiomatization: replace œÜ(x) and œà(y) in the axiom schema of Continuity with x ‚àà A and y ‚àà B, where A and B are universally quantified variables ranging over sets of points. Comparison with Hilbert Hilbert's axioms for plane geometry number 16, and include Transitivity of Congruence and a variant of the Axiom of Pasch. The only notion from intuitive geometry invoked in the remarks to Tarski's axioms is triangle. (Versions B and C of the Axiom of Euclid refer to \\"circle\\" and \\"angle,\\" respectively.) Hilbert's axioms also require \\"ray,\\" \\"angle,\\" and the notion of a triangle \\"including\\" an angle. In addition to betweenness and congruence, Hilbert's axioms require a primitive binary relation \\"on,\\" linking a point and a line. The Axiom schema of Continuity plays a role similar to Hilbert's two axioms of Continuity. This schema is indispensable; Euclidean geometry in Tarski's (or equivalent) language cannot be finitely axiomatized as a first-order theory. Hilbert's axioms do not constitute a first-order theory because his continuity axioms require second-order logic. The first four groups of axioms of Hilbert's axioms for plane geometry are bi-interpretable with Tarski's axioms minus continuity.

Abdoujaparov was a sprinter, nicknamed \\"The Tashkent Terror\\" as he was so ferocious in the sprints. His unorthodox and often erratic sprinting caused a number of crashes. He competed in the individual road race at the Olympic Games on two occasions: in 1988 for the Soviet Union and in 1996 for Uzbekistan; he placed fifth in 1988. Career Abdoujaparov was born in Tashkent to a Crimean Tatar family which was forcibly deported to Uzbekistan during Soviet rule. A graduate of the Soviet sports programme, he came into his prime just as his country gained independence; after initial difficulties (including Uzbekistan's not being affiliated to the UCI, which caused problems with the Cycling World Championship) he signed for a Western professional team and became one of the world's top sprinters. Abdoujaparov had numerous tussles with Laurent Jalabert in the Tour de France's green sprinters jersey competition in the early 1990s. In 1991 Abdoujaparov won the competition despite a spectacular crash during the final stage on the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, where he collided with the barriers 100 m before the finish and somersaulted into the air. Despite still holding enough points to win the sprinters' jersey, he had to cross the line unaided. Members of his team picked him up, put him back on the bike, and he rode slowly over the last few meters, medical staff walking alongside him. In his last complete tour in 1996, Abdoujaparov achieved a mountain breakaway for his last stage win, unusual for a sprinter. By this stage, though, results were not as good, and after failing seven separate anti-doping tests during the 1997 season, including twice at the 1997 Tour de France, he retired from cycling. He failed the tests screening for the presence in his body of, among others, the anti- asthma drug clenbuterol. Abdoujaparov, a British rock band formed by former Carter USM guitarist Les \\"Fruitbat\\" Carter, is named after him.

Its major tributaries are Brush Creek, Tomahawk Creek, and Indian Creek. Recreational Activities Along the Blue River can be found many miles of hiking, biking, and walking trails. Portions of these trails trace the path of a former steam railroad track of the Missouri Pacific Railroad line that ran from Dodson, Missouri south to Martin City, Missouri. This rail bed followed the Blue River and had many curves. The route was straightened in 1954 with the use of three high trestle bridges over the Blue River and one substantial cut. This improved line is now the Union Pacific / KC Southern Mainline and generally parallels the Blue river into the bottoms railyard near Front Street in Kansas City. History On the high bluffs overlooking the confluence of the Blue River and the Missouri River can be found a large Native American mound structure, designated as Indian Mound Park in the Indian Mound neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri. The three western trails, the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California trails crossed the river just north of Red Bridge Road and Minor Park. Mountain man/ fur trapper Jim Bridger had a trading post at this location. During the Civil War, the Blue River was the site of the Battle of Byram's Ford.

The campaign was founded by philanthropist, Norman Lear in 2004 and was led by former American presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. The 2004 campaign consisted of a road trip to towns across the country to educate people about the United States Declaration of Independence and voting rights. The 2006 campaign involved public service announcements that compared not voting to people silencing themselves and not standing up for their beliefs. The 2008 campaign consisted of videos posted on YouTube and MySpace to promote voting and the 2011 campaign featured a bondage-themed photo series comparing not voting to restricting yourself. In 2011, Declare Yourself merged with another campaign to form the nonprofit, Our Time. Purpose The DOI Road Trip's stated mission was to engage and energize all Americans, particularly young people, by bringing the Declaration to them. According to a press release, \\"This non-profit nonpartisan project hopes to inspire Americans to participate in civic activism, to exercise their rights and to vote. The Declaration of Independence Road Trip will travel to cities and towns across the United States, creatively combining elements of education, entertainment, and community outreach.\\" Founded by TV producer and philanthropist Norman Lear, and led by Honorary Co-Chairs and former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, \\"Declare Yourself\\" is described in their literature as a \\"national nonpartisan, nonprofit campaign initiated in 2004 to energize and empower a new movement of young voters to participate in the 2004 presidential election.\\" From January through Election Day 2004, over one million young and first-time voters registered to vote through events at Declare Yourself's spoken word and music tour of college campuses. Declare Yourself revved up its campaign again in 2007 for the 2008 presidential primaries and general election. This campaign is focusing on viral videos on video sharing sites like YouTube, MySpace, Break.com, and Daily Motion. The videos feature actors from the popular TV shows Reno 911! and The Office, and the movie Superbad. Commercials In 2006, three public service announcements (PSAs) were released, each directed by David LaChapelle. They pretend to be clich√©d commercials for different products but all end with the same ending: Silence. After the image, there's an eerie silence as the words \\"Only You Can Silence Yourself\\" appear, followed by a voice whispering \\"Register to vote now.\\" Dog Food An innocent-looking dog food ad where woman comments how her dog has not a care in the world and chooses the brand \\"Apathy\\" and hopes that she'll be like the dog and be taken care of herself.

Located on Capitol Hill, originally Goat Hill, in Montgomery, it was declared a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960.Blanche Higgins Schroer (September 29, 1975) , National Park Service and Alabama has had five political capitals during its history since it was designated as a territory of the United States. The first was the territorial capital in St. Stephens in 1817; the state organizing convention was held in Huntsville in 1819, and the first \\"permanent\\" capital was designated in 1820 as Cahaba. The legislature moved the capital to Tuscaloosa in 1826, where it was housed in a new three- story building. Finally, in 1846, the capital was moved again, when Montgomery was designated. These changes followed the development of greater population in the state, as European-American settlers moved in, often accompanied by their slaves, or purchasing more enslaved African Americans after arrival here. Large parts of the state were developed for King Cotton, and the population spread across it. The 1826 State House in Tuscaloosa was later used as Alabama Central Female College. After it burned in 1923, the ruins were retained within Capitol Park. The current structure in Montgomery is the state's fourth purpose-built capitol building: the first was in Cahaba, the second at Tuscaloosa, and the last two in Montgomery. The first capitol building in Montgomery, located where the current building stands, burned after two years. The current building was completed in 1851, and additional wings were added over the course of the following 140 years. The current capitol building temporarily served as the Confederate Capitol while Montgomery served as the first political capital of the Confederate States of America in 1861, before Richmond, Virginia was designated as the capital. Delegates meeting as the Montgomery Convention in the Senate Chamber drew up the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States on February 4, 1861. The convention also adopted the Permanent Constitution here on March 11, 1861. In 1964, more than one hundred years later, the third Selma to Montgomery march ended at the front marble staircase of the Capitol, with the marches and events surrounding them directly leading to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Description Architecturally, the building is Greek Revival in style with some Beaux-Arts influences. The central core of the building, as well as the east wing to the rear of the structure, is three stories over a below-grade basement. The north and south wings are two-stories over a raised basement. The current front facade is approximately wide and tall from ground level to the top of the lantern on the dome. History =First capitol building= The first Montgomery capitol building, destroyed by fire in 1849. The first capitol building to be built in Montgomery was designed by Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia. Andrew Dexter, one of Montgomery's founders, kept a prime piece of property empty in anticipation of the capital eventually being moved to Montgomery from Tuscaloosa. This property, atop what was then known as Goat Hill due to its use as a pasture, was chosen as the site for the new capitol building. Construction began in 1846, with the new building presented to the state on December 6, 1847. Button credited much of his architectural inspiration to Minard Lafever's Beauties of Modern Architecture. Button's building was stuccoed brick, with two full stories set over a rusticated raised basement. A two-story monumental portico with six Composite columns, topped by a broad pediment, was centered on the middle five bays of the front elevation. A central dome, in diameter, sat directly on a supporting ring at the main roof level behind the portico. The dome was crowned with an elaborate lantern patterned after the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. This first capitol building burned on December 14, 1849, little more than two years after its completion. The ruins were cleared by March 1850, with a new building soon to follow. =Current capitol building= The capitol building and confederate monument in 1906, prior to erection of north and south side-wings. The current capitol building was built from 1850 to 1851, with Barachias Holt as supervising architect. Holt, originally from Exeter, Maine, was a master mechanic by trade. Following his work on the capitol, he created a successful sash, door, and blind factory in Montgomery. The new building used the brick foundations and general layout of Button's previous structure, with modifications by Holt. The modifications included a full three-story building over a basement and a three-story front portico, this time without a pediment. Holt's dome was a departure from the previous work also; his wood and cast iron dome was supported on a ring of Corinthian columns and topped with a simple twelve-sided glazed lantern. John P. and James D. Randolph were the principal contractors. had previously completed extensive brickwork on the William Nichols-designed campus for the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. Randolph was in charge of the carpentry work, which was likely accomplished by subcontractors. Nimrod E. Benson and Judson Wyman were the building supervisors. The new capitol building was first occupied by the Alabama Legislature on October 1, 1851. The clock over the portico was installed in February 1852. The clock, along with a bell, was purchased by the City of Montgomery and presented to the state in 1852. In proportion to the capitol building, the clock appears as a square white box with black dials and crowned with a gabled roof. The dials are in diameter with minute hands and a hour hands. It has been criticized as architecturally inappropriate on various occasions since its initial installation. Inauguration of Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederate States of America on the steps of the capitol building on February 18, 1861. With the secession of Alabama and six other Deep South states and subsequent formation of the Confederacy in February 1861, the building served as its first capitol until May 22, 1861. A commemorative brass marker in the shape of a six-pointed star is set into the marble floor of the front portico at the precise location where Jefferson Davis stood on February 18, 1861, to take his oath of office as the only President of the Confederate States of America. In 1961 Governor John Patterson flew a seven-starred version of the Stars and Bars over the capitol for several days in celebration of the centennial of the Civil War. His successor, George Wallace, raised the Confederate Battle Flag over the dome on April 25, 1963, as a symbol of defiance to the federal government; this was the date of his meeting with U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to discuss desegregation of the University of Alabama . The flag continued to be flown over the capitol for almost 30 years. Several African American legislators and members of the state chapter of the NAACP were arrested in 1988 after attempting to remove the flag. In 1991 the flag was removed during renovations to the dome, and its return was barred by a 1993 state court decision. It ruled that an 1895 state statute allows only the national and state flags to be flown over the capitol building.Coski, Confederate Battle Flag, pp. 241-43. The building served as home to the Alabama Legislature until 1985, when it moved to the new Alabama State House. Officially, this move was temporary, since the Alabama Constitution requires that the Legislature meet in the capitol. In 1984, a constitutional amendment was passed that allowed the Legislature to move to another building if the capitol were to be renovated. The renovation started in 1985 and was completed in 1992 by the architecture group Holmes and Holmes. When the capitol was reopened, the Governor of Alabama and numerous other state offices moved back into the building, but the legislature remained at the State House. On May 7, 2009, the legislature reconvened in the capitol building for the first time since September 20, 1985, due to flooding in the State House. This required some adapting, as the capitol did not have desks in the House chamber, and those in the Senate chamber were 1861 replicas. Neither chamber has a computerized voting system. The capitol building's heating and air conditioning is supplied from the State House. Because the electricity had been turned off in the State House due to the flooding, there was no air conditioning in the capitol. The building =The exterior= View of the west (front) portico, dome, and a portion of the south wing. The original core of the building, as well as the subsequent additions, is essentially Greek Revival in style. The 1851 three- story core of the building features bays delineated by Doric pilasters and a monumental three-story hexastyle portico utilizing the Composite order. The original core of the building is , with an original central rear judiciary wing measuring . The first extension to the rear added another . Each side- wing is . The additions started with an extension to the east wing on the building's rear facade in 1885. Then a south wing with Beaux-Arts influences was added in 1906. An externally identical north wing was completed in 1912. The matching side-wings were designed by Montgomery architect Frank Lockwood, in consultation with Charles Follen McKim of McKim, Mead & White. The symmetrical north and south side-wings are each joined to the 1851 structure with a hyphen. Each hyphen features a recessed two-story Ionic portico on the west facade. Both of the adjoining side-wings feature two-story hexastyle Ionic entrance porticoes on their north and south elevations, respectively. The west and east facades of these wings also feature decorative two-story hexastyle pseudo-porticoes with engaged Ionic columns. A new east wing addition with a new three-story tetrastyle portico was built during the 1985‚Äì92 restoration. The new portico includes columns that match the Composite order originals of the main entrance portico on the 1851 west elevation. =The interior= Horace King. Upon entering the ground floor of the capitol building, one enters the main stair-hall. It is the location of cantilevered stairways that spiral up to the third floor. The twin cantilevered spiral staircases are among the building's finest original architectural features. They were designed and built by architect Horace King, a former slave who was freed in 1846. Due to his renown in Alabama and surrounding states as a bridge builder, the Alabama Legislature passed a special law that exempted him from the state's manumission laws, which normally required that freed slaves leave the state within one year of gaining their freedom. During the post-war Reconstruction Era he served two terms in the Alabama House of Representatives, in the building that he had helped to design and build. Immediately east of the stair-hall is the ground floor of the rotunda. The ground floor of the rotunda, not physically open to the upper rotunda floors, contains the memorial sculpture Lurleen Burns Wallace (1968) by F. R. Schoenfeld. Wallace was Alabama's first female governor and died while in office in 1968. From there, hallways leading to offices branch off into the north and south wings. The next major room on the ground floor is the old Supreme Court Chamber, part of the original capitol plan. Located in the east (rear) wing, it is the only portion of the wing dating back to 1851. It is a large rectangular room, one story high, with a concave entry wall and two robust Ionic columns visually dividing the space near the center of the room. Later east wing expansions continue on eastward from this room. The second floor is accessed via the main stairhall. From there the open rotunda is accessed to the east. The rotunda leads to the east wing offices, the old Senate Chamber to the north and the old House of Representatives Chamber to the south. The dome interior as seen from the floor of the rotunda. The interior of the capitol building is centered on the axial rotunda, which is topped by a large dome. The rotunda is open from the second floor and through the third floor to the top of the dome. The dome interior is decorated with eight painted murals by Roderick MacKenzie, a Scottish-born artist who relocated to Alabama. The murals illustrate MacKenzie's artistic interpretation of the history of Alabama. They were executed on canvas from 1926 to 1930 at his Mobile studio and then shipped to Montgomery by railroad for installation in July 1930. The murals depict the hostile meeting of Hernando de Soto and Tuskaloosa in 1540, the establishment of the colonial French capital of Mobile by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville from 1702 to 1711, the surrender of William Weatherford to Andrew Jackson in 1814, pioneers settling the Alabama wilderness in 1816, the drafting of the Constitution of Alabama in 1818, wealth and leisure during the antebellum era from 1840 to 1860, the inauguration of Confederate President Jefferson Davis on the capitol steps in 1861, and, finally, prosperity following the development of resources from 1874 to 1930. The restored House Chamber in 2016. Both legislative chambers date to the original 1851 construction. Both of them are rectangular in shape and extend upward through the third floor, with a mezzanine gallery on that level. The galleries in both chambers are supported by Corinthian columns. Those in the old Senate Chamber are gilded, while those in the old House of Representatives Chamber are simply painted. The old Senate Chamber is the smaller of the two legislative chambers, with a mezzanine in a circular pattern stretching around all four sides of the room, broken only above lectern platform. The old House Chamber is larger, with a curvilinear mezzanine on three walls that merges into each side wall before reaching the lectern platform wall. The Old Senate Chamber was the site of several events leading to the Civil War. The Alabama Secession Convention met here on January 11, 1861, and voted to withdraw from the Union. Then, the Confederate States of America was organized here via a provisional constitution on February 4, 1861, Jefferson Davis was elected as its first president on February 9, 1861, and finally the permanent Confederate constitution brought into effect on March 11, 1861. The grounds The capitol building in 1906. Note the original steps leading up to the portico and the iron fence. The landscape plan for Capitol Hill surrounding the capitol building was originally designed by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted in 1889. The grounds of Capitol Hill were surrounded by a cast iron fence from the 19th century into the first decades of the 20th. It was later removed and reused to enclose the Old Augusta Cemetery on Wares Ferry Road. The grounds still contain many trees and scrubs from the Olmsted design, in addition to numerous monuments. Other major features of the grounds include the marble steps leading to the front portico, the Confederate Memorial Monument and the Avenue of Flags. Statuary on the capitol grounds includes Albert Patterson (1961), Duty Called (1986) by Branko Medenica, James Marion Sims (1939) by Biancio Melarango, Jefferson Davis (1940) by Frederick Cleveland Hibbard, John Allan Wyeth (1920s) by Gutzon Borglum, and Joseph Lister Hill (1969) by Gualberto Rocchi. =The main steps= The principal access to the capitol building was originally via a long flight of steps leading to the front portico. These were much narrower than those in place today. They were replaced by new steps fabricated from Alabama marble in 1942. The modern steps are the same width as the portico and are edged with raised marble planters. It was here that the third Selma to Montgomery march ended on March 25, 1965, with 25,000 protesters at the foot of the capitol steps on Dexter Avenue. Prominent protesters included Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Coretta Scott King, Ralph Bunche, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, John Lewis, James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, and Joan Baez. A delegation from the protestors attempted to see Governor George Wallace to give him a petition that asked for an end to racial discrimination in Alabama. The governor had sent word that he would see the delegation, but they were denied entry to the capitol grounds twice and told no one would be let through. State police surrounded the capitol and prevented the marcher's delegation entry to the grounds. Martin Luther King Jr. then gave an impassioned speech at the base of the steps: Selma to Montgomery marchers arrive in Montgomery. At center are Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, with Ralph Abernathy's three children. The delegation was later let through into the capitol, but were told that Wallace's office was closed for the day. The delegation later left, without having been able to give their petition to anyone. It read: These steps remain as they were in 1965, although repairs were made during the 1992 renovation of the building. The steps have continued to be the rallying point for civil demonstrations over the succeeding years. Memorial Selma to Montgomery marches have ended at the steps on several occasions. The most recent, in honor of what would have been King's 83rd birthday, was held on January 15, 2012. On this occasion the marchers were greeted by Governor Robert J. Bentley. The steps have seen protests by LGBT groups and immigration groups in recent years as well. The annual Vigil for Victims of Hate and Violence, sponsored by Equality Alabama, took place on the capitol steps on February 20, 2011, to heighten awareness of the lack of hate crime legislation to protect LGBT people in the state. Hundreds of protesters converged at the steps on December 17, 2011, to protest the passage of Alabama's strict new immigration law, Alabama HB 56. =Confederate Memorial Monument= =Avenue of Flags= The Avenue of Flags is another major feature of the Alabama State Capitol grounds. It is a grouping of the flags of the U.S. states, with a native stone from each state, engraved with its name, set at the base of each flagpole. The flagpoles are arranged in a semi-circle between the Ionic portico of the capitol building's south wing and Washington Avenue. It was completed during the term of Governor Albert Brewer, being officially dedicated on April 6, 1968. Tourism The areas that are open for tourists are the entry stairhall, the old Governor's Office, the old State Supreme Court, the old Supreme Court Library, the rotunda, the old House of Representatives, and the old Senate Chamber. Its buildings and grounds are maintained by the Alabama Historical Commission.

A correctly-formed ping packet is typically 56 bytes in size, or 64 bytes when the ICMP header is considered, and 84 including Internet Protocol version 4 header. However, any IPv4 packet (including pings) may be as large as 65,535 bytes. Some computer systems were never designed to properly handle a ping packet larger than the maximum packet size because it violates the Internet Protocol documented in RFC 791. Like other large but well-formed packets, a ping of death is fragmented into groups of 8 octets before transmission. However, when the target computer reassembles the malformed packet, a buffer overflow can occur, causing a system crash and potentially allowing the injection of malicious code. In early implementations of TCP/IP, this bug is easy to exploit and can affect a wide variety of systems including Unix, Linux, Mac, Windows, and peripheral devices. As systems began filtering out pings of death through firewalls and other detection methods, a different kind of ping attack known as ping flooding later appeared, which floods the victim with so many ping requests that normal traffic fails to reach the system (a basic denial-of- service attack). Detailed information As defined in RFC 791, the maximum packet length of an IPv4 packet including the IP header is 65,535 (216 ‚àí 1) bytes, a limitation presented by the use of a 16-bit wide IP header field that describes the total packet length. The underlying Data Link Layer almost always poses limits to the maximum frame size (See MTU). In Ethernet, this is typically 1500 bytes. In such a case, a large IP packet is split across multiple IP packets (also known as IP fragments), so that each IP fragment will match the imposed limit. The receiver of the IP fragments will reassemble them into the complete IP packet and continue processing it as usual. When fragmentation is performed, each IP fragment needs to carry information about which part of the original IP packet it contains. This information is kept in the Fragment Offset field, in the IP header. The field is 13 bits long, and contains the offset of the data in the current IP fragment, in the original IP packet. The offset is given in units of 8 bytes. This allows a maximum offset of 65,528 ((213-1)*8). Then when adding 20 bytes of IP header, the maximum will be 65,548 bytes, which exceeds the maximum frame size. This means that an IP fragment with the maximum offset should have data no larger than 7 bytes, or else it would exceed the limit of the maximum packet length. A malicious user can send an IP fragment with the maximum offset and with much more data than 8 bytes (as large as the physical layer allows it to be). When the receiver assembles all IP fragments, it will end up with an IP packet which is larger than 65,535 bytes. This may possibly overflow memory buffers which the receiver allocated for the packet, and can cause various problems. As is evident from the description above, the problem has nothing to do with ICMP, which is used only as payload, big enough to exploit the problem. It is a problem in the reassembly process of IP fragments, which may contain any type of protocol (TCP, UDP, IGMP, etc.). The correction of the problem is to add checks in the reassembly process. The check for each incoming IP fragment makes sure that the sum of \\"Fragment Offset\\" and \\"Total length\\" fields in the IP header of each IP fragment is smaller or equal to 65,535. If the sum is greater, then the packet is invalid, and the IP fragment is ignored. This check is performed by some firewalls, to protect hosts that do not have the bug fixed. Another fix for the problem is using a memory buffer larger than 65,535 bytes for the re-assembly of the packet. (This is essentially a breaking of the specification, since it adds support for packets larger than those allowed.) =Ping of death in IPv6= In 2013, an IPv6 version of the ping of death vulnerability was discovered in Microsoft Windows. Windows TCP/IP stack didn't handle memory allocation correctly when processing incoming malformed ICMPv6 packets, which could cause remote denial of service. This vulnerability was fixed in MS13-065 in August 2013. The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is . In 2020, another bug (CVE-2020-16898) in ICMPv6 was found around Router Advertisement, which could even lead to remote code execution.

Early years Ackerman was born in Cottageville, South Carolina (another source says she was born in Williston, South Carolina), the daughter of Clarence Kilgo Ackerman and Mary Baker Ackerman, and grew up in Williston, in Barnwell County in southwestern South Carolina, one of four children. She graduated from Columbia College in South Carolina in 1945 and left for New York City soon after. She studied theater at the graduate level at Columbia University in New York and pursued art studies with Joseph Mugnaini and George DeGroat at Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. Television Ackerman played Dr. Maggie Graham on the ABC medical drama, Ben Casey, from 1961 until 1966. She played Anne Frazer on Bracken's World and the original Constance MacKenzie on the daytime program Return to Peyton Place. She appeared in an early episode of prime time soap Falcon Crest portraying the character of Elisabeth Bradbury. She also appeared in two episodes of Perry Mason, starring Raymond Burr: in 1965 she played the role of Amy Reid in the episode, \\"The Case of the Thermal Thief,\\" and in 1966 she played Laura Brandon in \\"The Case of the Positive Negative.\\" In 1977, she appeared in \\"Never Con a Killer,\\" the pilot for the ABC crime drama The Feather and Father Gang. Stage Ackerman played the title role in the one act play Salome, by Oscar Wilde, as part of the Alexander Kirkland Acting Group. The production was released on Magic-Tone Records (CTG 4011). Ackerman's Broadway credits include A Meeting by the River (1979). Film Ackerman's film debut came in Face of Fire in 1959. Personal life On June 7, 1956, Ackerman, at 32, married her future Ben Casey co-star Sam Jaffe, who was then 65. Although there was a 33-year difference in their ages, the couple had a very successful and happy marriage- until Jaffe died of cancer in 1984. They had no children. She sold her home in Beverly Hills, California, and returned to South Carolina to be near her large extended family in 1998. Shortly afterwards she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Ackerman was also a noted artist, who had numerous exhibits in both Beverly Hills and Columbia, South Carolina. Death Ackerman died November 1, 2006, after having suffered a stroke in Columbia, South Carolina. She was 82.

Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.117) Brian Lee and Gary Young. They feuded with the Armstrong family, Cooley and The Nightmares in Continental, and with Jerry Lawler and Jeff Jarrett in Memphis. =Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1991‚Äì1993)= In 1991, another version of The Stud Stable was formed in Smoky Mountain Wrestling that contained Robert Fuller, Jimmy Golden, and Dutch Mantel. The Stud Stable feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express and the Heavenly Bodies. They started out as pure heels, but became 'tweeners, feuding with both heels and babyfaces. The group disbanded when Robert Fuller went to WCW to become a manager in 1993. =World Championship Wrestling (1994‚Äì1996)= The final version was created in World Championship Wrestling when Robert Fuller was known as \\"Col. Rob Parker.\\" He formed the stable in 1994 with Arn Anderson, Terry Funk, Golden as Bunkhouse Buck, and Meng, who was Parker's bodyguard. This stable feuded heavily with Dusty and Dustin Rhodes until late 1994 when Funk left and was replaced by Dick Slater. They have also feuded with Brian Pillman. The Blacktop Bully was also briefly a member. In August 1995, Meng left (eventually to join the Dungeon of Doom) and Anderson went to rejoin Ric Flair and eventually reform The Four Horsemen. The Stud Stable feuded with Harlem Heat over the WCW World Tag Team Championship in which Buck and Slater won. They were also feuding because of a love/hate relationship between Parker and the Heat's manager, Sister Sherri. Parker eventually dumped Slater and Buck for Martel and the stable was broken up when Fuller left WCW in 1997. =Major League Wrestling (2018‚Äì2019)= In 2018, MLW created a new version of the Stud Stable with Col.

In the UK, Sony released a stand-alone CD, A Selection of Music from 31 Songs, featuring 18 songs. The hardcover edition of Songbook, published in the US by McSweeney's and illustrated by Marcel Dzama, includes a CD with 11 of the songs featured in the book. Summary The music varies from established classics like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan to independents like Ani DiFranco, Top 40 pop like Nelly Furtado, and a few songs with special meaning only to Hornby. Song by song, Hornby delves into what makes music catchy or classic, and how it can come to play an integral role in a person's emotional life. Proceeds from the book go to the TreeHouse Trust, a UK charity operating a school for children with autism and communications disorders, which Hornby's son attends, and to 826 Valencia, a US-based learning center, founded by McSweeney's publisher Dave Eggers, that offers writing workshops and tutoring. The paperback edition of Songbook adds a few music-related essays by Hornby from other sources. After the release of \\"Songbook,\\" McSweeney accepted online submissions from authors writing about their favourite songs in the same manner as Hornby. These submissions were posted to the McSweeney website. After Hornby mentioned he was a fan in Songbook, Ben Folds contacted him and Hornby wrote the song \\"That's Me Trying\\" for William Shatner's album Has Been.

Abstentionism differs from an election boycott in that abstentionists participate in the election itself. Abstentionism has been used by Irish republican political movements in the United Kingdom and Ireland since the early 19th century. It was also used by Hungarian and Czech nationalists in the Austrian Imperial Council in the 1860s.  Hungary  When suppressing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Austrian Empire abolished the Diet of Hungary. Austria's 1861 February Patent reserved places for Hungary in the indirectly-elected Imperial Council, but the Hungarians did not send representatives, arguing the council was usurping authority properly belonging to the Diet. Emulating the Hungarians, the Czech delegates for Bohemia withdrew in 1863, and those from Moravia in 1864. Hungarian demands were met by the Compromise of 1867, with the empire becoming the dual monarchy of Austria‚ÄìHungary in which the Hungarian half was ruled by a revived Diet. In 1904, Arthur Griffith published The Resurrection of Hungary arguing for a British‚ÄìIrish dual monarchy similar to the 1867 compromise. Griffith's subsequent \\"Sinn F√©in policy\\" developed this model. Tom Kettle of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) countered that Bohemia had remained in the Austrian half of the post-1867 empire, and its delegates abandoned abstentionism in 1879.  In Ireland  = Before partition = After the Act of Union 1800, Ireland was represented in the British Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Repeal of the Act of Union was a goal of many Irish nationalists. In 1845, a motion was carried at the Repeal Association's committee for all Irish members of parliament (MPs) to withdraw from Westminster. It was proposed by Thomas Osborne Davis of the Young Ireland movement. However, the committee felt that MPs already sitting could not withdraw without breaking the oath of office they had taken upon election. The Irish Confederation, which withdrew from the Repeal Association in 1847, resolved in favour of immediate abstention; however, its founder William Smith O'Brien continued to speak at Westminster.Davis, p.122 In 1848, Charles Gavan Duffy proposed that Irish MPs expelled from Westminster should sit in a separate Irish parliament.Davis, p.256 Other early abstentionist advocates included George Sigerson in 1862, and John Dillon in 1878, who envisaged abstentionist Irish MPs meeting in a separate Irish parliament.Lydon 1998, p.325 From the 1860s, Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) leaders Charles Kickham and John O'Leary favoured abstentionism.McGee 2005, p.39 In 1869, G. H. Moore suggested nominating imprisoned republicans for election, knowing they were precluded as convicted felons from taking seats.McGee, pg. 43 On this basis, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa (in 1870) and John Mitchel (twice in 1875) were returned at by-elections in Tipperary; O'Donovan Rossa was in prison at his election, while Mitchel was in exile. Kickham envisaged a \\"great national conference\\" calling on Irish MPs to withdraw from Westminster. A motion to that effect was proposed by Charles Guilfoyle Doran and passed at the convention of the Home Rule League (HRL).McGee, pg.48 \\"Honest\\" John Martin, \\"independent nationalist\\" MP for Meath from 1871 to 1875, spoke in Westminster only to raise nationalist protests, and refused to vote.McGee, pg. 42‚Äì43 In the 1874 election, 59 HRL MPs were returned, including John O'Connor Power in Mayo, who was a member of the IRB Supreme Council. He was to fall out with the IRB over allegations of misappropriating election funds,McGee, p.49‚Äì50 and became progressively less radical. O'Connor Power believed that Westminster was the best platform to argue Ireland's case for self-government. Withdrawal from Parliament would be an abandonment of the Home Rule party to those who favoured conciliation rather than confrontation.Stanford, Jane, 'That Irishman The Life and Times of John O'Connor Power', pp 70‚Äì71, 73‚Äì74. By 1876 it was clear that the HRL would never be able to organise a national convention, and MPs elected with its endorsement would remain at Westminster.McGee, p.53 An alternative to abstentionism was obstructionism, including the use of filibuster. This was practised by the HRL and its successor, the IPP under Charles Stuart Parnell from the late 1870s.  Sinn F√©in  Arthur Griffith's \\"Sinn F√©in Policy\\", formulated between 1905 and 1907, called for Irish MPs to abstain from Westminster and sit in a parallel parliament in Dublin.Feeney 2002, pp.33‚Äì34 The first Sinn F√©in abstentionist candidate was Charles Dolan in 1908. Having sat as MP for North Leitrim for the IPP, he resigned after joining Sinn F√©in, and lost the ensuing by-election.Feeney 2002, pp.49‚Äì50 Laurence Ginnell's 1909 proposal that the United Ireland League (UIL) adopt abstentionism caused a near-riot; he left the UIL but continued to sit at Westminster until he joined Sinn F√©in in 1917.; Abstentionism was opposed by most nationalists, especially after the January 1910 general election when the IPP held the balance of power at Westminster and secured passage of the Third Home Rule Bill from the Liberal government.Feeney 2002, p.53 The nationalist mood changed after the 1916 Rising, and the IPP itself withdrew from Westminster in April 1918, to protest against the extension of conscription to Ireland.Feeney 2002, p.97 At the 1916 West Cork by-election, Sinn F√©in initially endorsed All-for-Ireland League candidate Frank J. Healy, a supporter interned after the 1916 Rising, but withdrew support when Healy declared his intention to take his seat; the confusion contributed to Healy's defeat. The first abstentionist MP elected was Count George Noble Plunkett after the North Roscommon by-election of 3 February 1917.Lydon, p.343. Plunkett did not categorically state his abstentionism until after his victory.Feeney 2002, p.63 Plunkett's Liberty League, Griffith's monarchist Sinn F√©in, and the northern Irish Nation League merged later that year into a reconstituted Sinn F√©in, agreeing after contentious disputation that abstentionism was a principle rather than merely a tactic. Sinn F√©in MPs elected to Westminster in November 1918 refused to take their seats there and instead constituted themselves in Dublin in January 1919 as the TDs () of the first D√°il, which was claimed to be the legitimate parliament of the Irish Republic.Feeney 2002, p.112 The Irish Labour Party stood aside in 1918 in favour of Sinn F√©in, having at first proposed to be abstentionist until emergency laws were lifted. Sinn F√©in was unsure whether to boycott the 1921 elections to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and House of Commons of Southern Ireland set up by the Government of Ireland Act 1920.Feeney 2002, pp.130‚Äì131 It decided to contest the Northern election for tactical reasons and the Southern one for consistency, with its returned MPs becoming the TDs of the Second D√°il. One strand within Republicanism, in remaining loyal to this pre-Partition Irish Republic, denies the legitimacy of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.Feeney 2002, pp.168‚Äì170,174 Other parties reached accommodation with the southern state but not Northern Ireland. Some groups have boycotted elections within either jurisdiction; others have been abstentionist; others abstained from some bodies but not others. Abstentionism has often been a divisive issue within Republicanism. = In the Irish Free State/Republic of Ireland = The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State, with an opt-out for Northern Ireland and requiring an Oath of Allegiance for Free State legislators. The Treaty split Sinn F√©in, mainly over the Oath rather than \\"Partition\\", and caused the Irish Civil War.Feeney 2002, p.135 The June 1922 election featured a \\"Sinn F√©in panel\\" of pro- and anti-Treaty candidates, but the resulting Third D√°il was boycotted by the anti-Treaty TDs. These refounded Sinn F√©in in 1923 and based their continued abstention from the Free State D√°il on Partition.Feeney 2002, pp.156‚Äì7, 168‚Äì9 Fianna F√°il split from Sinn F√©in in 1926 and abandoned abstentionism in the Free State in 1927.Feeney 2002, pp.158‚Äì160 From 1955, Sinn F√©in contested local elections in the Republic of Ireland and took its seats, arguing this did not amount to recognising the state. In 1970, at its Ard Fheis (annual conference), Sinn F√©in split again on the issue of whether or not to reverse its long-standing policy of refusing to take seats in D√°il √âireann. The split created two parties calling themselves \\"Sinn F√©in\\". The anti-abstentionist party was known as \\"Official\\" Sinn F√©in. It changed its name to \\"Sinn F√©in the Workers Party\\" (SFWP) and won a seat in the D√°il in the general election of 1981, which it took. The following year it dropped \\"Sinn F√©in\\" from its name to become \\"The Workers' Party\\". The abstentionist party was initially referred to as \\"Provisional\\" Sinn F√©in, but after 1982 it was known simply as \\"Sinn F√©in\\"; it continued to abstain from taking seats won in all institutions. Sinn F√©in split in 1986, as in 1970, over whether to take seats in D√°il √âireann. The larger group led by Gerry Adams abandoned abstentionism, while Republican Sinn F√©in (RSF), led by Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh, retained it. Sinn F√©in's first sitting Teachta D√°la was Caoimhgh√≠n √ì Caol√°in, elected in Cavan‚ÄìMonaghan in 1997. RSF has retained the policy of abstentionism from both D√°il √âireann and the Northern Ireland Assembly. RSF has not in fact contested elections for D√°il √âireann or Westminster. = In Northern Ireland = After Partition, most non- abstentionist parties in the southern state did not organise at all in Northern Ireland. In early 1922, the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State was seen as representing the interests of nationalists in Northern Ireland and had a policy of not recognising the Northern Irish government. Catholic bishop Joseph MacRory (who later became Archbishop of Armagh and a Cardinal) indicated to the Provisional Government that Joe Devlin and his party members wanted to enter the new Parliament of Northern Ireland, and was worried that the policy of non-recognition would result in Northern Irish nationalists having to \\"fight alone\\", but his advice was ignored. Abstentionism at local elections was effectively prohibited by a 1934 law requiring candidates to take an oath to attend council sessions. The Nationalist Party did not take their seats during the first Stormont parliament (1921‚Äì25). Despite forming the second-largest parliamentary party, they did not accept the role of Opposition for a further forty years. They did so on 2 February 1965 but withdrew from opposition again in October 1968, two weeks after police batoned demonstrators at a civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968.Brendan Lynn (1979), Holding the Ground: The Nationalist Party in Northern Ireland, 1945‚Äì1972 . (CAIN Web Service) Cahir Healy was elected to both the Stormont and Westminster parliaments under a variety of nationalist labels between the 1920s and the 1960s. He was abstentionist in Stormont until 1927 and at Westminster from 1950 to 1952. In the 1930s, Healy led the Irish Union Association, which supported his policy of intermittent tactical abstentionism, whereas the otherwise-similar Northern Council for Unity regarded abstentionism as a principle. From 1953, Stormont candidates were required to take the British oath of allegiance before standing, precluding Sinn F√©in from doing so.Feeney 2002, p.199 This did not apply at Westminster elections, where Sinn F√©in often gave non-Sinn F√©in abstentionist nationalists a free run to avoid splitting the nationalist vote, but conversely fielded a spoiler candidate against non-abstentionist nationalists. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) became the Opposition on its formation on 21 August 1970 but that party withdrew from Stormont in July 1971. The SDLP participated in the assembly set up for the Sunningdale Agreement, and in the Constitutional Convention. It originally intended to boycott the election to the 1982 Assembly, but adopted abstentionism to avoid giving a free run to Sinn F√©in.Feeney 2002, pp.308‚Äì10 Brian Feeney suggests that Sinn F√©in's \\"active abstention\\", where those elected acted as local spokespeople in the media, was more effective than the SDLP's policy of sending its representatives instead to the New Ireland Forum in Dublin.Feeney 2002, pp.316‚Äì7 The SDLP's participation in the 1996‚Äì98 Northern Ireland Forum was intermittent. Sinn F√©in adopted the \\"armalite and ballot box strategy\\" in 1981, and first contested modern elections in Northern Ireland with the 1982 Assembly elections, from which they abstained. The 1983 ardfheis resolved to take seats in the European Parliament, as the 1985 ardfheis did for that year's local elections.Feeney 2002, p.328 Sinn F√©in abstained from the Northern Ireland Forum. Since the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, both the SDLP and Sinn F√©in have taken their seats in that body. SDLP MPs have consistently taken their seats in Westminster, in contrast to Sinn F√©in MPs, who refuse to take their seats there as they refuse to recognise the UK Parliament's right to legislate for any part of Ireland. Fianna F√°il's sole Stormont election came in 1933, when its leader √âamon de Valera agreed to stand as an abstentionist for South Down, where he had been a Sinn F√©in MP in the 1920s. Fianna F√°il registered as a political party within Northern Ireland in 2007. In 2014 its leader M√≠che√°l Martin announced it would contest elections from 2019. It has not made clear whether it will contest elections to Westminster. Republican Sinn F√©in continue their long standing policy of abstentionism. It is not a registered party in Northern Ireland, but members have contested the Assembly elections as independents. When Saoradh, a dissident republican party, was established in 2016, it had not decided whether to contest elections, but said it would in any case abstain from taking up any seats won in Stormont, Westminster or Leinster House. After the June 2017 UK general election, which resulted in a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party with the DUP in potential balance of power, Gerry Adams reiterated Sinn F√©in's long-standing position that their elected MPs would not swear allegiance to the Queen nor take their seats in Westminster.

The concept's most visible success has been achieved by Jack Stack and his team at SRC Holdings. The basis of open-book management is that the information received by employees should not only help them do their jobs effectively, but help them understand how the company is doing as a whole. According to Case, \\"a company performs best when its people see themselves as partners in the business rather than as hired hands\\" (Case,1998 as cited in Pascarella, 1998Pascarella, P. (1998). Open the books to unleash your people. American Management Association International, 87(5), 58-60.). The technique is to give employees all relevant financial information about the company so they can make better decisions as workers. This information includes, but is not limited to, revenue, profit, cost of goods, cash flow and expenses. Stack and Case conceptualize open-book principles in similar ways. Stack uses three basic principles in his management practice called, The Great Game of Business.Stack, J. (1992). The great game of business. New York, Currency Doubleday. His basic rules for open-book management are: *Know and teach the rules: every employee should be given the measures of business success and taught to understand them *Follow the Action & Keep Score: Every employee should be expected and enabled to use their knowledge to improve performance *Provide a Stake in the Outcome: Every employee should have a direct stake in the company's success-and in the risk of failure Similarly, in 1995, Case made sense of open-book with three main points:Case, J. (1995). Open-book management: The coming business revolution. New York, HarperCollins. *The company should share finances as well as critical data with all employees *Employees are challenged to move the numbers in a direction that improves the company *Employees share in company prosperity In a company fully employing open-book management employees at all levels are very knowledgeable about how their job fits into the financial plan for the company. However taking a company from \\"normal\\" to open is not as easy as just sharing financial statements with employees. Open-book management is considered to be a success when companies allow improvements on their financial numbers to come from the bottom tier of employee rather than pressure exerted by a traditional top-down management system. (Johnson, 1992 as cited in Aggarwal & Simkins, 2001). While employees need to be trained to understand income statements and balance sheets; open-book management aims to achieve a level of understanding of company finances between all employees to the degree that they are able to report predictions to upper management. In order to motivate employees to strive for change, open-book management focuses on a \\"Critical Number\\". The number is different for every company but it is a number that represents a prime indicator of profitability or break-even point. Discovering this Critical Number is a key component of creating an open-book company. Once this is discovered, a \\"Scoreboard\\" is developed that brings together all the numbers needed to calculate the critical number. The Scoreboard is open for all to see and meetings take place to discuss how individuals can influence the direction of the \\"Score\\" and therefore, ultimately, the performance against the Critical Number. Finally a Stake in the Outcome is provided which can be a bonus plan that is tied to Critical Number performance or it can include Equity sharing or both. Conferences The Annual Gathering of Games is the only practitioner-led conference on creating a culture of ownership by teaching employees to think and act like owners . At the event, business leaders learn from people who have used open- book management to increase the size, profitability and employee engagement in their companies . The conference consists of sessions, keynote speakers and workshops that are specifically targeted to each phase of open-book management. Notes and references *Shaffer, J. (2000).

Johannes Wiedewelt (1 July 1731 ‚Äì 17 December 1802), Danish neoclassical sculptor. He became a court sculptor, introducing neoclassical ideals to Denmark in the form of palace decorations, garden sculptures and artifacts and, especially, memorial monuments. He was undoubtedly the best known Danish sculptor before Bertel Thorvaldsen. Life =Early training= He was born in Copenhagen to royal sculptor to the Danish Court, Just Wiedewelt (1677‚Äì1757) and his wife Birgitte Lauridsdatter. The elder Wiedewelt recognised his son's talents early, and the boy trained under the Italian history painter Hieronimo Miani, one of the two leaders of the Drawing and Painting Academy (Tegne- og Malerakademiet) in Copenhagen along with Louis August le Clerc (1688‚Äì1771), as early as perhaps 1744. This Academy was the precursor to the still-extant Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) established ten years later. When Miani left Denmark in 1745 to return to Italy, the elder Wiedewelt took a stronger hand in training the boy, apprenticing him in his workshop. At the same time the young Wiedeweldt continued at the Academy, drawing under Johan Christof Petzoldt (1708-1762) and he presumedly also trained under royal sculptor to the Danish Court, Didrick Gercken (169-1748). He began already to produce his own works early, and had produced in Spring 1750 two small busts cast in tin of King Frederik V and Queen Louise. He was paid a reasonable sum for this work, and it encouraged him to follow his dream to study outside of Denmark. =Student travel to Paris= Several months later at nineteen years of age he ventured out on a student travel that took him over Hamburg to Rouen and finally to Paris in August 1750. There he met the Danish Legation secretary to the French Court in Paris Joachim Wasserschlebe (1709-1787) who would become a patron of the young sculptor. With Wasserschlebe's help, Wiedewelt was taken into the studio of the renowned Baroque sculptor Guillaume Coustou the Younger, where from 1750-1754 he worked partially as a student and partially as an assistant. He later received a yearly royal allowance from King Frederik, which was doubled after two years. In Paris he also came to know Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. During 1752-1754, Wiedewelt made a sculpture of fellow-Dane, Magnus Gustav Arbien (1716‚Äì1760), medallionist who was at the time studying under a royal stipend from the Danish Court. Wiedewelt won a silver medallion from the French Academy of Art (Acad√©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture) in 1753. There was a sweeping artistic interest during those times for the study of ancient art. This rage originated in the discoveries of Herculaneum in 1738 and Pompeii in 1748, and was fanned by the directorship of the French Academy, Marquis de Marigny Abel-Fran√ßois Poisson(1727‚Äì1781), brother of royal mistressMadame de Pompadour (1721‚Äì1764). Poisson introduced the technique of drawing from antiquities, especially architecture, sculpture and landscapes, instead of from models. This technique was based on his experiences in Italy visiting the recently excavated archeological sites. =Continued travel to Rome= Wiedewelt was the first to receive a travel stipend from the newly established Danish Academy of Art in 1754 and used the funds to travel to Italy. Although Coustou tried to convince Wiedewelt to stay in Paris longer, the young sculptor left for Rome in May 1754. His trip took him over Lyon, Marseille and Civitavecchia; he arrived in Rome on 7 June 1754. A letter of recommendation from Wasserschlebe introduced Wiedewelt to the Director of the French Academy in Rome (l¬¥Academie de France √° Rome), Charles- Joseph Natoire (1700-1777). He lived and studied at the Academy, lodging at the Palazzo Mancini. Natoire put him in contact with others in residence there. Among these were German painter Anton Raphael Mengs, Italian Pompeo Batoni, and German archeologist and art theorist Johann Joachim Winckelmann who arrived in Rome 1755. At the Academy he, along with other students, came under the influence of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who had lived in Rome since 1740 and who set a heightened focus on antiquities as artistic subject matter. Wiedewelt visited private collections such as the Farnese collection, as well as the publicly accessible ones such as the Capitoline Museums and the Vatican Museum. He and Johann Winckelmann studied ancient sculptures together, and Winckelmann advised the younger Wiedewelt, encouraging him to use these sculptures as a base for his drawings and to use his knowledge of ancient art as the basis for his artistic production. Wiedewelt made many drawings and sketches of these ancient sculptures during his Roman residence. The two were inseparable. Wiedewelt's friendship and admiration for Winckelmann left a deep impression on him, especially in regards his acquired knowledge and appreciation for Ancient Greek artifacts and art. During his time in Rome he also managed to take excursions to Naples, Pompeii, Herculaneum and Portici. Several of these trips were made in the company of Winckelmann in 1758. The two would remain close, maintaining a lively letter exchange, until Winckelmann was murdered in Trieste in 1768. =Return to Denmark and an artistic career= Wiedewelt left Rome on 1 July 1758, when his financial support was running out, and after he had been ordered home to Denmark by the Academy. He traveled back in the company of friend, neoclassical painter Johan Edvard Mandelberg. They traveled over Caprarola, Siena, Florence, Pisa, Carrara, Lucca, Bologna, Padua, Venice, and Trieste where they studied the local art collections and churches, and on through the Tyrol and Germany. They arrived back to Copenhagen on 6 October 1758. Hardly six months after his return Wiedewelt was named member of the newly organised Art Academy, as well as being named royal sculptor to the Danish Court in 1759, inclusive gratis studio at Materialgaarden near Frederiksholm's Canal. He was known for his good taste in art and his knowledge of antiquities. He became quickly the judge of artistic good taste in Denmark. Commissions soon followed. As a first commission he was requested to sculpt a memorial monument to the long deceased king Christian VI of Denmark by his widowed wife, Sophie Magdalene. The marble monument was completed in 1768, but was not installed at Roskilde Cathedral until 1777. The neoclassical monument included a sarcophagus and two female figures, Sorgenand Ber√∏mmelsen. This was the first neoclassical sarcophagus in Denmark, and is considered to be neoclassicism's start in Denmark. In 1760 he began work on another comprehensive project, sculptural groups, individual sculptures and decorations for the gardens at the French-inspired baroque Fredensborg Palace. He produced a large series of drawings for the King giving his suggestions for the decoration of the gardens. He came to work closely with architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin, with whom he would travel together to London and Paris in the late 1760s. His outdoor sculptures here and at other gardens have come to comprise the greatest assembled collections of his works. In 1761 he became a professor at the Art Academy. He also took on a leading position with Fourniers Porcelain Factory 1761-1766. Wiedewelt wrote a small manifesto in 1762 entitledTanker om Smagen udi Kunsterne i Almindelighed. He contributed to the decoration of Frederiks Church, also known as the Marble Church (Marmorkirken) with no less than 64 figures and 30 reliefs. Due to the scale of the royal projects, the time constraints and the common practices of the time Wiedewelt often left the direct work of sculpting be carried out by his studio assistants from sketches, which he delivered. In 1765-1766 he delivered a plaster allegorical relief and twelve medallions of the Oldenborg kings to the sumptuous Knights Hall (Riddersalen) at Christiansborg Palace, plus additional decorative pieces. These were all lost in the fire of 1794. Some of the medallions are evidenced in engravings. He served as Treasurer of the Academy 1767-1772, and served as Director of the same 1772-1778, 1780-1789, and 1793-1795. He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1769, and subsequently in 1778 and 1794. In 1769 he completed the monument to Frederik V in Roskilde Cathedral which includes a large sarcophagus resting on footpieces and decorated by numerous sculptures, behind which is a column topped of an urn, a medallion with the king's portrait, and on each side of the sarcophagus, sitting approx. 9' high above the floor, are two crowned, grieving female figures representing Denmark and Norway. The memorial chapel was created as a collaboration between Wiedewelt and architect Caspar Frederik Harsdorff. =Later career= In 1768-1769 Wiedewelt traveled to Paris and London in the company of architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin, then architect for Frederik's Church, now known as the Marble Church (Marmorkirken). His travel journals show that he visited famous gardens during the trip, and studied them carefully. Large commissions from the court slowed down drastically after this foreign tour, as Johann Friedrich Struensee's took over control of the country from the weak, young, schizophrenic, newly crowned King Christian VII and put his cost-cutting reforms into place between 1769-1771. These cutbacks also resulted in Jardin's losing his position with the Church after this same two- year travel. German-born Struensee was widely disliked, and between 1770-1772 Wiedewelt created a series of drawings satirizing Struensee and his associate Count Enevold Brandt. He also designed several coins for Christian VII in 1771. Starting in the early 1770s, the reaction to Struensee led to a wider distrust of foreigners in positions of power in Denmark. This included the foreign-born artists, especially French artists, in the King's service who lost power and influence in Denmark's official artistic and Academic circles. Friend Jardin resigned his professorship at the Academy on 26 March 1771. From this point on, although Wiedewelt remained court sculptor until his death, his commissions came primarily from private patrons, and were mostly grave monuments and sarcophaguses. He received many such commissions, and during a thirty-year period he produced over 36 such works. Among these are one for Ludvig Holberg in Sor√∏ made in 1779, and another for the first wife of Adam Gottlob Moltke, statesman and high official at the Danish Court. The only large order he received from the court after that time was one for H√∏egh- Guldbergs National Historical Garden (H√∏egh-Guldbergs nationalhistoriske anl√¶g) named for Ove H√∏egh-Guldberg, theologian and historian. The commission consisted of fifty-four monuments to be set up on the expansive grounds of Crown Prince Frederik V's J√¶gerspris Castle in J√¶gerspris. They were sculpted between 1777-1789. Wiedewelt was inspired by Ove Malling's book Store og gode Handlinger af Danske, Norske og Holstenere published in 1777. He decorated the park with monuments and memorial stones in honour of exceptional Danes, Norwegians, and Holsteiners, placing these pieces in the open parkland. He took advantage of his recent studies of foreign gardens, especially the English garden Stowe Park near Buckingham which he had visited, and created a new visual language. Additionally his studio produced reliefs in 1773 of Hercules and Omphale for the Hercules Pavilion in the King's Garden (Kongens Have), the gardens of Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen. In 1782 he designed coin cabinets for the Royal Coin Museum (Det kongelige M√∏ntkabinet) at the same castle. In 1783 he created Bernstorff Column (Bernstorffst√∏tten), a memorial for Foreign Minister Count Johan Hartvig Ernst Bernstorff in Lyngby, who had early-on instituted agricultural reforms (landboreformer) on his estate, prior to the land-wide reforms that followed on 20 July 1788. These land-wide reforms led to the monumental Frihedsst√∏tten in Copenhagen. Work was started August 31, 1792 and it was erected in 1797. It is still on public display although in a new location. The monument was 20 meters high and consisted of an obelisk of red sandstone, a pedestal of grey marble and a base on three steps of red sandstone before the renovation of 1998-1999. Wiedewelt contributed to this piece with the statue Troskaben, which is one of four sculptures in this large piece, and with the relief Retf√¶rdighedens Genius. The other artists who contributed to the monument were Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, who designed the overall monument, colleague Andreas Weidenhaupt and Nicolai Dajon. Between 1785-1801, Wiedewelt created fifteen monuments for the day's important people at Assistens Cemetery near Copenhagen's Northern Gate (N√∏rreport). Of these eight can still be seen today in the park-like setting. Final Years Wiedewelt was chosen eight times as Director of the Art Academy; the last time he held the position was 1793-1794. He worked hard to keep the Academy running well, facing often-shifting attitudes from the court and uncertain royal financial support. He was committed to the end, in spite of ill health in his advanced age. He also worked until the end, even though his own financial means worsened drastically, and he lived in abject poverty. During his many years of good economy he lived a festive life with no restrictions, and he was very generous. When times became rough, as it did not only for him but also for others who were accustomed to royal support, he suffered along with the royal house's financial problems. In spite of his meager economy he continued to support two elderly sisters, a servant man, as well as a poor cousin. He had never married. By the end Wiedewelt had pawned most of his belongings, when a final catastrophe proved to be too much for him; a shipload of marble blocks he had purchased with borrowed money went to the bottom of the sea near L√¶s√∏. This apparently proved to be more than he could handle, and shortly thereafter on 17 December 1802 he drowned in an apparent suicide in Sortedams√∏en, a lake just outside that day's Copenhagen limits. He was buried on Christmas Eve at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen. His grave monument was made by friend and colleague Andreas Weidenhaupt (1738‚Äì1805). Works He had a rich fantasy, and his compositions were easy and natural. His works were tasteful, and influenced by both his French Baroque training and his careful study of and appreciation for late Greek and Roman art. He was well-versed in the use of classical allegory and symbols, especially those having to do with death. He was also inspired by Nordic mythology and ancient, Viking and Icelandic sagas, and made many drawings based on these. Sculptures and reliefs attributed to him and his studio have been lost to time, and are sometimes only evidenced by sketches and engravings. His works are a part of the royal households and gardens. Those in the gardens are the largest collections of his works in one place. He viewed his garden decorations as creating an outdoors theatre presentation relating to the surrounding trees of various types, to figure groups of sculptures and to decorative columns and obelisks. He had a sense of the developing romantic garden. His memorial monuments are spread out in churches throughout Denmark, with the royal monuments at Roskilde Cathedral. Many of these monuments can be found at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen. His drawings are also highly esteemed. He illustrated a deluxe edition of Ludvig Holberg's \\"Peder Paars\\" in 1772, engravings for which were made by Johan Frederik Clemens, who collaborated with Wiedewelt on several projects. He also made illustrations for a book by Peder Topp Wandal on the J√¶gerspris Castle project in 1783. Clemens also engraved these illustrations, Wiedewelt, along with architect Harsdorff, was one of the primary figures responsible for introducing Neoclassicism to Denmark. He was highly esteemed by his contemporaries and by those artists who followed. He is considered an important transitional figure leading to future generations of Danish artists. He had a large library of books covering many subjects, which often served as a source of inspiration. As professor at the Academy he introduced his Neoclassical theories to artistic students. Among his many students was Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, future Director of the Academy and instructor for Bertel Thorvaldsen. In memory of Wiedewelt In 1803, Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl√§ger, poet and playwright, wrote a well-known elegy in his honour, calling him \\"Denmark's Phidias\\". Taus hun sukker B√∏lgen mildt sig lukker om den gamle Tindings s√∏lvgr√•e Haar. Hun forsvinder. Dagen bleg oprinder; Hist paa Frihedsst√∏tten L√¶rken slaaer. Troskab gr√¶der I de hvide Marmorkl√¶der Kold og bleg, den ranke hulde M√∏.

The pale day runs out. Yonder on Freedom's Monument the lark sounds. Faithfulness cries In its white marble clothes Cold and pale, the proud gracious maiden Hand on breast Never, never comforted She stares out onto the dark lake.

Soderberg was previously head coach at Lindenwood University, Saint Louis University, South Dakota State University, Loras College, and an interim head coach at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Playing career Born in Wausau, Wisconsin, Soderberg played basketball at Pacelli High School in Stevens Point, Wisconsin for his father, Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame Coach, Don Soderberg. Soderberg played basketball in college at Ripon College from 1980 to 1982 before he transferred to University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point, playing at Stevens Point from 1982 to 1984 under head coach Dick Bennett, and with Terry Porter (who later became player and eventually a head coach in the National Basketball Association). The 1984 team made it all the way to the championship game of the NAIA Tournament before falling 50‚Äì48 to Fort Hays State University. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point in 1985 with a degree in physical education. Coaching career =Loras and South Dakota State= Then in 1986 he received his master's degree from Colorado State University in physical education. He was then hired as an assistant coach at Fort Hays State University for one season and quickly moved on to an assistant post at Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa. He became head coach of Loras in 1988 and served until 1993 compiling a record of 79‚Äì45. He was then hired as head coach of South Dakota State University where he stayed from 1993 to 1995 compiling a record of 36‚Äì18. =Wisconsin= After the two successful stints as a head coach at Division II schools, his former coach, Dick Bennett, hired him as his assistant at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He served as an assistant to Bennett through the 2000 season. Three games into the 2000‚Äì01 campaign, the Badgers (coming off a Final Four appearance in 2000) saw their head coach, Dick Bennett retire. Soderberg took over the heralded team and led them to a 16‚Äì10 record, but the team lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Georgia State University, considered a major disappointment to many Badger fans. Soderberg was then let go from his head coach position at the end of the season, as the Badgers hired Bo Ryan. =Saint Louis= Soderberg accepted an assistant post at Saint Louis University under head coach Lorenzo Romar. After his first season Romar was hired away to become the head coach at the University of Washington. Brad Soderberg was promoted to head coach for the 2002‚Äì03 season. His first two seasons he led the Billikens to two NIT Tournament appearances. After his first three years SLU moved from Conference USA to the Atlantic 10. Soderberg was let go after three consecutive seasons without reaching the post season. He did however have a 20 win season during his final year at Saint Louis University. He was replaced by Rick Majerus. On April 17, 2007 St. Louis sports station KFNS announced that Soderberg had been dismissed as men's basketball coach. No longer a head coach at a college, Soderberg coached his younger son's 4th grade team at St. Cletus in St. Charles, Missouri. On July 7, 2008, Soderberg was named Interim Director of Athletics at Loras College. =Lindenwood= On May 14, 2009, Soderberg was named head coach of Lindenwood University in Saint Charles, Missouri. In his first season as head coach of the Lions, Soderberg led the Lions to one of the best seasons in school history, a record of 23‚Äì10, and set a school record for most home wins in a season, going 13‚Äì1 at home. On March 29, 2010, the university announced the transfer of Kramer Soderberg, Missouri player of the year during his senior year of high school, from Miami University (Ohio) to join his father's program. In his second season as head coach of the Lions, Lindenwood set a new school record for most straight wins after Defeating Missouri Valley 77‚Äì66 for the team's 12th straight win on January 6, 2011. The Lions finished the regular season 26‚Äì4 won the 2011 HAAC Regular Season Championship and earned an automatic bid to the 2011 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. The 26 wins set a new best record in school history. Soderberg led the Lions to their first NAIA Division I Tournament win when the 20th seeded Lions defeated 14th-seeded St. Catharine College 78‚Äì72. Lindenwood's defense held St. Catharine ten points below its season average and forced 13 turnovers in the game. Offensively, Lindenwood made 33 of 40 free throws. All three of Lindenwoods guards finished with double digit points, Kramer Soderberg finished with 27, Bazzell with 14 points, and Rose with 13. Soderberg's Lions eventually fell in the second round to 3rd-seeded Mountain State University, ending Lindenwood's final season in the NAIA and Heart of America Athletic Conference with the best record in school history with a 29‚Äì6 overall record. In 2011, Lindenwood began the transition from the NAIA to the NCAA's Division II. Competing as an independent, Lindenwood finished the season with a 26‚Äì3 record and was invited to the NCAA's Division II Transitional Tournament in Spearfish, South Dakota. Soderberg led them to the Division II Transitional National champions by defeating Minot State and Sioux Falls to end the season with a final 28‚Äì3 record.http://www.lindenwoodlions.com/news/2012/3/3/MBB_0303121107.aspx?path=mbball Lindenwood announced their entry into the Mid‚ÄìAmerica Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA).http://www.lindenwoodlions.com/news/2011/7/11/GEN_0711111459.aspx?path=general Although ineligible for post-season play during the transition to Division II, Soderberg's Lions finished their first regular season in the MIAA in a third place tie in the fifteen team league.http://www.themiaa.com/standings.aspx?standings=8&path;=mbball =Virginia= On April 17, 2015, Soderberg was named an assistant coach at Virginia, serving under Dick Bennett's son and former Wisconsin assistant, Tony Bennett.

This law was one of the strictest religious censorship statutes ever enacted in England. In March 1401 William Sawtrey became the first Lollard to be burned. The statute declared there were \\"divers false and perverse people of a certain new sect ... they make and write books, they do wickedly instruct and inform people ... and commit subversion of the said catholic faith\\".Text of the Statutes of the Realm, 2:12S-28: 2 Henry IV The sect alluded to is the Lollards, followers of John Wycliffe. De heretico comburendo urged \\"that this wicked sect, preachings, doctrines, and opinions, should from henceforth cease and be utterly destroyed\\", and declared \\"that all and singular having such books or any writings of such wicked doctrine and opinions, shall really with effect deliver or cause to be delivered all such books and writings to the diocesan of the same place within forty days from the time of the proclamation of this ordinance and statute\\". \\"And if any person ... such books in the form aforesaid do not deliver, then the diocesan of the same place in his diocese such person or persons in this behalf defamed or evidently suspected and every of them may by the authority of the said ordinance and statute cause to be arrested\\". If they failed to abjure their heretical beliefs, or relapsed after an initial abjuration, they would \\"be burnt, that such punishment may strike fear into the minds of others\\". Section 6 of the Act of Supremacy 1558 (1 Eliz.1 c.1) (1559) repealed the statutes but it was not until March 1677 that a bill to take away the Crown's right to the writ was introduced in the House of Commons. It passed in that session.  Meaning and linguistics  De heretico comburendo is a Latin phrase meaning \\"Regarding the burning of heretics\\". An alternate spelling is De haeretico comburendo, reflecting the proper ancient and Middle Ages spelling (by the second century the diphthong ae had been changed in pronunciation from to ; most texts today use the spelling without the letter a). See Latin spelling and pronunciation for more information.  History  Although partial English translations of the Bible had existed for hundreds of years, the Middle English translation published under the direction of John Wycliffe in the 1380s, known as Wycliffe's Bible, was the first complete translation and the first to gain widespread acceptance and use. The Church authorities condemned Wycliffe's translation because they deemed the commentary included with the work to be heretical, and because they feared a vernacular translation of the Bible from the Latin Vulgate, absent appropriate catechesis, would lead the ignorant laity to reject Church authority and fall into heresy. Wycliffe was the inspiration for what would become the Lollard movement, which was considered heretical by the Church. The Constitutions of Oxford, established in 1409 by Archbishop Thomas Arundel, were further punitive measures intended to punish heresy in England that grew in large part out of the De heretico comburendo. In Hil. 9 Jac. I. the court magistrate considers an inquiry from an attorney and solicitor about whether the writ of De heretico comburendo was sustained upon conviction of heresy before the Ordinary, saying it was not for reasons based on certain authorities, though upon further consultations other magistrates disagree based on Elizabethan era precedents and say that enforcement of the statute De heretico comburendo is not dependent on the aforementioned cited authorities, and the writ is sustained, but suggest that conviction before the High Commissioners was the \\"most convenient and sure way\\" to convict a heretic.The Reports of Sir Edward Coke, Knt. [1572‚Äì1617]: In English, in Thirteen Parts Complete; with References to All the Ancient and Modern Books of the Law, Volume 7 The writ was abolished by the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677.

His travels took him to the Holy Land, the Middle East, Northern Africa, and as far as India. Biography Pietro Della Valle was born in Rome on 2 April 1586, to a wealthy and noble family. His early life was spent in the pursuit of literature and arms. He was a cultivated man, who knew Latin, Greek, classical mythology, and the Bible. He also became a member of the Roman Accademia degli Umoristi, and acquired some reputation as a versifier and rhetorician. When Pietro was disappointed in love and began to consider suicide, Mario Schipano, a professor of medicine in Naples, suggested the idea of travelling in the East. It was Schipano who received a sort of diary in letters from Pietro's travels. Before leaving Naples, Pietro took a vow to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. So, at age 28, he left Venice by boat on 8 June 1614 and reached Constantinople; he remained there for more than a year and acquired a good knowledge of Turkish and a little Arabic. On 25 September 1615, he went to Alexandria. Because he was a nobleman of distinction, he travelled with a suite of nine persons, and with every advantage due to his rank. From Alexandria he went on to Cairo, and, after an excursion to Mount Sinai, left Cairo for the Holy Land. He arrived there on 8 March 1616, in time to take part in the Easter celebrations at Jerusalem. After visiting the holy sites, Pietro travelled from Damascus to Aleppo. After seeing a portrait of the beautiful Assyrian Christian Sitti Maani Gioerida, he went to Baghdad and married her a month later. While in the Middle East, he made one of the first modern records of the location of ancient Babylon and provided \\"remarkable descriptions\\" of the site. He also brought back to Europe inscribed bricks from Nineveh and Ur, some of the first examples of Cuneiform available to modern Europeans.The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p. 7 At that time Baghdad was being contested between Turkey and Iran during the frequent Ottoman-Persian Wars, so he had to leave Baghdad on 4 January 1617. Accompanied by his wife Maani, he proceeded to Persia, and visited Hamadan and Isfahan. In the summer of 1618, he joined Shah Abbas in a campaign in northern Persia. Here he was well received at court and treated as the Shah's guest. On his return to Isfahan he began to think of going back home through India, rather than endanger himself again in Turkey. However, the state of his health and the war between Persia and the Portuguese at Ormuz generated problems. In October 1621 he left Isfahan, visited Persepolis and Shiraz and made his way to the coast. But it was not until January 1623 that he found a passage for Surat on the English ship Whale, Captain Nicolas Woodcock. He sojourned in India until November 1624, his headquarters being Surat and Goa. In India, Pietro Della Valle was introduced to the King Vekatappa Nayaka of Keladi, South India by Vithal Shenoy, the chief administrator of those territories. The accounts of his travels are one of the most important sources of history for the region. He was at Muscat in January 1625, and at Basra in March. In May he started by the desert route to Aleppo, and boarded on a French ship at Alexandretta. He reached Cyprus and finally Rome on 28 March 1626. There, he was received with many honours, not only in literary circles, but also from Pope Urban VIII, who appointed him a gentleman of his bedchamber. The rest of his life was uneventful; he married his second wife, Mariuccia (Tinatin de Ziba), a Georgian orphan of a noble family. She had been adopted by his first wife as a child, had travelled with him, and was the mother of fourteen children. He died in Rome on 21 April 1652, and is buried at his family's burial vault at Santa Maria in Aracoeli. By 1665 the portion of his \\"Travels\\" dealing with India and with his return had been translated into English. They contain accounts of his discussions with \\"Hindoo\\" Brahmans about whether the Egyptians or Indians first came up with the concept of reincarnation, a dialogue with a woman who invited him to her upcoming sati, a description of the barefoot Queen of Olaza (Abbakka Chowta, Ullal), who was out on the embankments giving directions to her engineers‚Äîand many other bits of first-rate ethnography. Apart from his activities as an ethnographer, Della Valle was also a composer and a writer of theoretical treatises on music. He composed several dialogues (actually brief oratorios) on biblical subjects. His only preserved work is an oratorio composed for l'Oratorio del Croficisso di Saint Marcello, where he experiments with musical modes and scales inspired by ancient music theory. For this purpose, he developed two new instruments, such as a \\"violone panharmonico\\" and a \\"cembalo triharmonico\\". Notwithstanding his interest in ancient musical practices, in his theoretical writings on music (e.g. \\"Della musica dell'et√† nostra che non √® punto inferiore, anzi √® migliore di quella dell'et√† passata\\", Rome 1640, and \\"Note ‚Ä¶ sopra la musica antica e moderna, indirizzato al Sig.r Nicol√≤ Farfaro\\", 1640/41), he praises the modern music culture in contemporary Rome and defended the modern music against the criticism of Nicol√≤ Farfaro, an Italian musician of his times. Pietro Della Valle also wrote texts and librettos for several musical spectacles, such as \\"Il carro di fedelt√† d'Amore\\", (music by his teacher of harpsichord Paolo Quagliati, performed in Rome in 1606 and printed in 1611), and \\"La valle rinverdita\\" (written in celebration of the birth of his first child in 1629, now lost).

Kazanskaya Bogomater), was a holy icon of the highest stature within the Russian Orthodox Church, representing the Virgin Mary as the protector and patroness of the city of Kazan, and a palladium of all of Russia, known as the Holy Protectress of Russia. According to legend, the icon was originally acquired from Constantinople, lost in 1438, and miraculously recovered in pristine state over 140 years later in 1579. Two major cathedrals, the Kazan Cathedral, Moscow, and the Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg, are consecrated to Our Lady of Kazan, and they display copies of the icon, as do numerous churches throughout the land. The original icon in Kazan was stolen, and likely destroyed, in 1904. The \\"F√°tima image\\" is a 16th-century copy of the icon, or possibly the 16th-century original, stolen from St. Petersburg in 1917 and purchased by F. A. Mitchell-Hedges in 1953. It was housed in F√°tima, Portugal from 1970 to 1993, then in the study of Pope John Paul II in the Vatican from 1993 to 2004, when it was returned to Kazan, where it is now kept in the Kazan Monastery of the Theotokos. Copies of the image are also venerated in the Catholic Church. Feast days of Our Lady of Kazan are 21 July, and 4 November (which is also the Russian Day of National Unity). History According to tradition, the original icon of Our Lady of Kazan was brought to Russia from Constantinople in the 13th century. After the establishment of the Khanate of Kazan ( 1438) the icon disappeared from the historical record for more than a century. Metropolitan Hermogenes' chronicle, written at the request of Tsar Feodor in 1595, describes the recovery of the icon. According to this account, after a fire destroyed Kazan in 1579, the Virgin appeared to a 10-year-old girl, Matrona, revealing the location where the icon lay hidden. The girl told the archbishop about the dream but she was not taken seriously. However, on 8 July 1579, after two repetitions of the dream, the girl and her mother recovered the icon on their own, buried under a destroyed house where it had been hidden to save it from the Tatars. Kazan Monastery of the Theotokos where the icon was conserved until 1904, and the home of the \\"F√°tima image\\" since 2004 Other churches were built in honour of the revelation of the Virgin of Kazan, and copies of the image were displayed at the Kazan Cathedral of Moscow (constructed in the early 17th century), at Yaroslavl, and at St. Petersburg. Russian military commanders Dmitry Pozharsky (17th century) and Mikhail Kutuzov (19th century) credited invocation of the Virgin Mary through the icon with helping the country to repel the Polish invasion of 1612, the Swedish invasion of 1709, and Napoleon's invasion of 1812. The Kazan icon achieved immense popularity, and there were nine or ten separate miracle-attributed copies of the icon around Russia. On the night of June 29, 1904, the icon was stolen from the in Kazan where it had been kept for centuries (the building was later blown up by the communist authorities). Thieves apparently coveted the icon's gold frame, which was ornamented with many valuable jewels. Several years later, Russian police apprehended the thieves and recovered the frame. The thieves originally declared that the icon itself had been cut to pieces and burnt, although one of them eventually confessed that it was housed in a monastery in the wilds of Siberia. This one, however, was believed to be a fake, and the Russian police refused to investigate, using the logic that it would be very unlucky to venerate a fake icon as though it were authentic.Alex de Jonge, The Life and Times of Grigorii Rasputin, 1993, Barnes and Noble Books, 45. The Orthodox Church interpreted the disappearance of the icon as a sign of tragedies that would plague Russia after the image of the Holy Protectress of Russia had been lost. Indeed, the Russian peasantry was wont to credit all the miseries of the Revolution of 1905, as well as Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, to the desecration of her image.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, there was speculation that the original icon was in fact preserved in St. Petersburg. Reportedly, an icon of Our Lady of Kazan was used in processions around Leningrad fortifications during the Siege of Leningrad (1941-1944) during World War II. Another theory proposed that the Bolsheviks had sold the image abroad, although the Russian Orthodox Church did not accept such theories. The history of the stolen icon between 1917 and 1953 is unknown. In 1953 Frederick Mitchell-Hedges purchased an icon from Arthur Hillman. Although the status of the icon as the original Kazan icon remained disputed, Cyril G.E. Bunt concluded \\"that it is the work of a great icon painter of the 16th century [...] the pigments and the wood of the panel are perfectly preserved as exhaustive X-ray tests have proved, and have mellowed with age\\", suggesting that while it was a copy of the original icon, it was nevertheless the original icon carried by Pozharski in 1612. It was exhibited at the World Trade Fair in New York in 1964-1965. On 13 September 1965, members of the Blue Army of Our Lady of F√°tima spent the night in veneration of the icon in the pavilion in New York. The Blue Army eventually bought the icon from Anna Mitchell-Hedges for US$125,000 in January 1970, and the icon was enshrined in F√°tima, Portugal. In 1993 the icon from F√°tima was given to Vatican and had it installed in his study, where he venerated it for eleven years. In his own words, \\"it has found a home with me and has accompanied my daily service to the Church with its motherly gaze\\". John Paul II wished to visit Moscow or Kazan to personally return the icon to the Russian Orthodox Church. When the Moscow Patriarchate rejected this plan, the Pope presented the icon to the Russian Church unconditionally in August 2004. On August 26, 2004, it was exhibited for veneration on the altar of St. Peter's Basilica and then delivered to Moscow. On the next feast day of the holy icon, July 21, 2005, Patriarch Alexius II and Mintimer Shaymiev, the president of Tatarstan, placed it in the . Philip Coppens, A supernatural icon for Mother Russia, Atlantis Rising, Issue 87 (May/June 2011). The icon is enshrined in the Cathedral of the Elevation of the Holy Cross, part of the erstwhile Convent of the Theotokos (re-established as a monastery in 2005), on the site where the original icon of Our Lady of Kazan was found, and plans are underway to make the monastery's other buildings into an international pilgrimage centre.

Early life and family Wharton was born in Virginia and was raised by an uncle following the deaths of his parents. He graduated from the University of Nashville and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1826. Afterward, Wharton moved to Mexican Texas, and on December 5, 1827, married Sarah Ann Groce, the daughter of a wealthy landowner. Their only child was a son, John A. Wharton (1828‚Äì1865), who served in the American Civil War as a Confederate major general. The Wharton family established a farm known as Eagle Island Plantation.Merle Weir, \\"WHARTON, WILLIAM HARRIS,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed January 20, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Texas Revolution Wharton served as a delegate to the Convention of 1832 from the District of Victoria. The convention unanimously elected him to deliver the resolutions to the legislature of Coahuila y Tejas (then a part of Mexico) in Saltillo and to the Mexican Congress in Mexico City.Davis (2006), p. 93. Following that convention's unsuccessful attempts to form a new state separate from Coahuila y Tejas, Wharton served as president of the follow-up Convention of 1833 and openly advocated complete independence from Mexico, in contrast to the moderate view held by native Texans and others like Stephen F. Austin. Wharton later served as a delegate from the Columbia district to the Texas Consultation of 1835. Wharton entered military service during the Texas Revolution, serving as a colonel and judge advocate general. He participated in the siege of San Antonio de B√©xar in the fall of 1835. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed as one of three commissioners to the United States to secure aid for the Texians. Senator After the revolution resulted in the formation of the Republic of Texas in 1836, Wharton supported Austin's unsuccessful candidacy for president, which was instead won by Sam Houston. Wharton served as a member of the new republic's senate from the District of Brazoria in 1836. In November, President Houston appointed Wharton as minister to the United States, hoping to secure political recognition and possible annexation. Returning to Texas in 1837 by sea, Wharton was captured by a Mexican ship and carried to Matamoros, where he was imprisoned. He escaped (allegedly by wearing a nun's habit) and returned to Texas to be re-elected to the Texas Senate in 1838. Wharton introduced the \\"Lone Star\\" flag to Congress on December 28, and may have designed it. Death Wharton County, Texas was named for William H. Wharton and his brother John A. Wharton Wharton accidentally shot and killed himself while dismounting from his horse near Hempstead in Waller County, Texas, on March 14, 1839. He was buried at Restwood Memorial Park in Clute, Texas. Legacy Both Wharton County, Texas, and its county seat, Wharton, were named for him and his brother John Austin Wharton (1806‚Äì1838), who was likewise a statesman of the Republic of Texas.

The USAAC placed an order for a prototype on 25 November 1939, designating it XP-50, but it lost the competition to the Lockheed XP-49. Design and development First assigned Design 34, later G-41 by the builder, Grumman, the design was entered into competition alongside proposals from Bell, Brewster, Curtiss, Lockheed, and Vought.Baugher, Joe. \\"Grumman XP-50.\\" USAAC/USAAF/USAF Fighter Aircraft, 2 August 1999. Retrieved: 2 April 2010. The XP-50 design was similar to that of the XF5F-1 with modifications to the fuselage nose to house the nose-wheel of the tricycle landing gear and provisions for self-sealing fuel tanks and pilot armor. The planned armament was two 20 mm (.79 in) cannon and two .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns.Dorr and Donald 1990, p. 119. Testing During testing, the XP-50 prototype (39-2517) was lost on 14 May 1941, falling victim to a turbo- supercharger explosion that destroyed the aircraft. The test pilot Robert Hall bailed out while the XP-50 plunged into Smithtown Bay in Long Island Sound.Dorr and Donald 1990, p. 97. Based upon experience with the XF5F-1 and the XP-50, Grumman had begun work on a more advanced fighter, designated model G-51. Thus, the USAAC decided to replace the XP-50 with the newer design and recommended procurement of two G-51s, designated XP-65, using the original XP-50 expenditure order to cover the development. Consideration was given to combining the Air Corps and Navy requirements into a common design, but the weight and performance penalties inherent in conflicting requirements were considered great enough that separate designs would be needed. Since the U.S. Navy considered Grumman one of its major production sources and that producing two different model aircraft by Grumman would impede manufacture of aircraft types the U.S. Navy needed, it was decided that development of the XF7F-1 would continue, and the XP-65 as a parallel development was abandoned.

This is differentiated further into \\"source material\\", consisting of natural and depleted uranium, and \\"special fissionable material\\", consisting of enriched uranium (U-235), uranium-233, and plutonium-239. Uranium ore concentrates are considered to be a \\"source material\\", although these are not subject to safeguards under the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty.IAEA Safeguards Glossary, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5 According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC), there are four different types of regulated nuclear materials: special nuclear material, source material, byproduct material and radium. Special nuclear materials have plutonium, uranium-233 or uranium with U233 or U235 that has a content found more than in nature. Source material is thorium or uranium that has a U235 content equal to or less than what is in nature. Byproduct material is radioactive material that is not source or special nuclear material. It can be an isotope produced by a nuclear reactor, the tailings and waste that is produced or extracted from uranium or thorium from an ore that processed mainly for its source material content. Byproduct material can also be discrete sources of radium-226 or discretes sources of accelerator-produced isotopes or naturally occurring isotopes that pose a threat greater or equal to a discrete source of radium-226. Radium is also a regulated nuclear material that is found in nature and produced by the radioactive decay of uranium. Radiums half-life is approximately 1,600 years.

Texas Health and Human Services Commission Inspector General In January 2015, Texas Governor Greg Abbott named Bowen as the Inspector General for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The appointment is subject to Senate confirmation. Brought in as an outsider to clean up a contracting scandal, Bowen also had to contend with hundreds of millions of questionable fraud allegations made by his predecessor. By September he had settled cases totaling $9 million. In addition, Bowen faced repairing ties with the Medicaid provider community and with HHSC. As Inspector General, Bowen is charged with preventing, detecting, and deterring fraud, waste, and abuse in the Texas Health and Human Services System. On October 22, 2015, Bowen accused Planned Parenthood of misconduct and informed them all of the state's Planned Parenthood affiliates were being dropped as a Medicaid health care provider. He cited videos showing misconduct and sent investigators with letters to Planned Parenthood offices in San Antonio, Dallas, and the Houston area, requesting records. His letters cited the authority of Health and Human Services Commission to investigate allegations of potential fraud involving Medicaid payments. Bowen was forced to resign by Gov. Greg Abbott on May 10, 2017, after the governor discovered Bowen had been moonlighting for Hyatt Farber Schreck, a lobbying firm that represents the Iraqi government. Bowen said he had consulted with a state ethics advisor and was told that his moonlighting \\"fully complied\\" with the health commission's policy. However, the health agency's policies explicitly bar employees from having an \\"economic or monetary interest in a lobbying firm\\".

Initially, all three branches of the new state government occupied the four floors of the statehouse. As the state expanded the branches relocated to adjacent buildings and additions. The 1901 portion of the Capitol is now maintained as the Arizona Capitol Museum with a focus on the history and culture of Arizona. The Arizona State Library which occupied most of the 1938 addition until July 2017 re-opened in late 2018 as a part of the Arizona Capitol Museum. Arizona Capitol Museum  View of the original capitol building Museum exhibits, events, and programs focus on the evolution of Arizona from Territory to State. The Arizona Takes Shape exhibit provides school-age visitors curriculum-related information for Arizona State History and government studies. The museum has over 20 exhibits featuring contemporary, historical and artifacts from the Arizona state-owned collections. Permanent exhibits include the sinking of USS Arizona, the formal silver service from USS Arizona, a timeline of events pivotal in making Arizona a state, the Governor and Secretary of State's original offices, the historical senate, and house. Visitors can enter the Historic House Chamber where the people can sit at the desks. There is also a room dedicated to the 140 changes in the Arizona Constitution over 100 years of statehood. The Governor's office on the second includes artifacts from several of Arizona's governors as well as a flag used by Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. One impressive display shows the enormous silver and copper punchbowl service from , as well as a bronze sculpture that was ensconced outside the Admiral's stateroom and used as a centerpiece at state dinners wherever USS Arizona was docked. Both of these historical artifacts survived the sinking of Arizona because they had been removed from the ship for cleaning prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The punchbowl service is the only one of its kind and is composed of etched copper panels depicting desert scenes set into a silver bowl ornamented with mermaids, dolphins, waves, and other nautical themes. Of particular interest is the display of a collection of gifts received by Arizona as part of the Merci Train sent by France to the United States following World War II. The French wanted to thank America for sending the Friendship Train: 250 railroad cars full of fuel, oil, and food in 1948 during a time that the European countries were devastated by World War II. Tens of thousands of French citizens donated objects to be sent to the United States and it was decided that because the outpouring of goods was so great, one boxcar would be sent to each state with one being shared between the District of Columbia and the Territory of Hawaii. All of the items were to be loaded in \\"Forty and Eight\\"-type boxcars, named after the sign painted on them which stated that 40 men or 8 horses could be loaded inside. Each car was to be adorned with the coats of arms of all of the provinces of France. The capitol building displays work by the noted Arizona artist Lon Megargee. History The building was created as part of an effort to demonstrate that the Arizona Territory was ready for statehood. A design contest was won by James Riely Gordon, whose original plan called for the Capitol to be much larger, with a more prominent rotunda and large wings for both houses of the legislature on each side of the current building. Funding deficits meant the project had to be reduced, so the legislative wings were discarded from the plan and a small lead-alloy top substituted for Gordon's decorative dome. Construction of the Capitol began in 1898, and it began operation in 1901. In 1918 and 1938, expansions were added on the west side of the building, which had the same architecture and increased the total square footage from the original 40,000 to a final 123,000. It was home to the Legislature until 1960, when the current house and senate buildings were constructed, and the Governor's Office until 1974, when the executive tower was built. The state at that time had a plan of converting the original Capitol into a museum dedicated to Arizona's history. The original opening of the Arizona Capitol Museum was announced by Governor Bruce Babbitt at his inauguration in 1978 and hosted over 40,000 schoolchildren in that first year in 1979. After a restoration, the building was re-opened as a museum in 1981. In the 1990s, more than $3 million was spent to renovate the Capitol and rooms were restored to their original design. Again, due to budget deficits, construction was stopped on a few rooms on the third floor and they remain incomplete. The Capitol is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On January 14, 2010, the Arizona State Department of Administration reported that it had sold the surrounding state buildings to private investors: the tower, the two flanking legislative buildings, and other state structures. The Old Capitol was not part of this transaction. Architecture View from the east at sunset. (2007). The Senate building is on the left and the House building is on the right. The building is made largely from materials indigenous to Arizona, including malapai, granite, and the copper dome. The design is optimized for the desert climate of Arizona, with thick masonry walls that insulate the interior, skylights, and round \\"bullseye\\" clerestory windows to let heat out of the legislative chambers. The building is topped with a weather vane similar to the Winged Victory of Samothrace, visible through a skylight from within the rotunda. Capitol Mall renovation proposal As Arizona's population has grown, the Capitol complex itself has become increasingly crowded. The Senate and House buildings, opened in 1960, have been deteriorating. The Senate, in particular, is prone to constant plumbing problems, and occasionally a broken pipe floods the entire building. The Capitol itself is now used exclusively as a museum, and serves over 70,000 visitors each year, including more than 50,000 school children. In the past complaints had been made that the site was not pleasing aesthetically, and compare the Senate and House buildings as oversized \\"bunkers\\" which eclipse the beauty of the Capitol. A task force appointed by the state legislature in 2007 reported that the complex is \\"barely\\" adequate to suit the state's current needs and \\"wholly\\" inadequate to suit the state's future needs. As a result, proposals were made in 2008 to renovate or rebuild the Capitol site, to a grander site, as well as a site that will serve the needs of the government more adequately. To date, keeping the integrity of the 1901 building in original condition, including the \\"cramped\\" spaces occupied by some of the Senate and the House staff have been the main focus for the Capitol Museum administrator and staff. The building's original usage is part of the state history. Proposals for relocating some office and meeting space back into the Capitol included the House and Senate buildings undergo either a drastic rebuilding and expansion or a complete demolition and construction of new facilities for the House and Senate. A past Arizona State University study planned a comprehensive redesign for the entire Capitol mall and complex.Arizona Capitol Mall District Revitalization Plan Gallery  See also *USS Arizona salvaged artifacts *List of state and territorial capitols in the United States References External links * *Virtual Tour of the Capitol Museum and Grounds Category:State capitols in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Government buildings with domes Category:Government buildings in Arizona Category:History museums in Arizona Category:Museums in Phoenix, Arizona Category:1900s in Arizona Territory Category:Government buildings completed in 1900 Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Arizona Category:Tourist attractions in Phoenix, Arizona Category:James Riely Gordon buildings Category:Neoclassical architecture in Arizona Category:1900 establishments in Arizona Territory ","title":"Arizona State Capitol"},{"id":"2181581","text":"17th Avenue may refer to: * International Avenue, Calgary, Alberta, Canada * 17th Avenue (Brooklyn), New York, United States ","title":"17th Avenue"},{"id":"2181582","text":"The FAMAE SAF submachine gun is produced and manufactured by FAMAE (F√°bricas y Maestranzas del Ej√©rcito) since 1993.http://www.military- today.com/firearms/famae_saf.htm Since 1999, Taurus have signed an agreement with FAMAE to produce the SAF under license in .40 S&W; for the Brazilian law enforcement.https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/11/22/taurus-smgs- carbines-famae-heritage/ Semi-automatic only variants manufactured by FAMAE are mostly marketed for sale in Canada.https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/10/09/famae-family-firearms- saf-mini-sg-542/ Design The SAF is a blowback-operated select-fire gun, firing from a closed bolt.

He is ranked 8th dan in the Aikikai. He is chief instructor at the dojo New York Aikikai,and President of the United States Aikido Federation(USAF). Life Originally from Tokyo, Japan, Yamada became interested in aikido through his father's cousin, Tadashi Abe, who trained at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. He entered Hombu Dojo as an uchi deshi in 1955 at the age of 17. His exposure to westerners and ability to speak English made him a natural choice to teach to American soldiers. He first came to the United States in 1964 to do an aikido demonstration at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. In 1966 Yamada and his family hosted Virginia Mayhew, an aikido practitioner from New York. Although the original New York Aikikai was founded in 1961 and led by Yasuo Ohara, when Yamada moved to New York he assumed control and moved the dojo from its 18th Street local to its present location. In those days there was no other aikido teacher (with the exception of the original NY Aikikai founder Yasuo Ohara) from Japan on the east coast of the US, and Yamada would travel weekly to Boston, with frequent trips to Philadelphia and points south as well. In 1966 some of the burden was relieved when he invited Mitsunari Kanai to take over the small group in Boston. Over time Yamada's students have grown to have students of their own, and have risen to ranks as high as 7th dan. In 1988 Yamada invited Seiichi Sugano to join the dojo, making it one of the few dojo outside Japan with two 8th dan shihan in residence. In 2004 the New York Aikikai celebrated its 40th anniversary with a summer camp at Colgate University with many shihan and Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba in attendance. Yamada continues to keep an active teaching and travelling schedule, holding seminars in the US as well as Latin America, Russia, France, Germany and other points around the world. In France, he teaches at the summer seminar at La Colle-sur-Loup which was organized by his senpai, Nobuyoshi Tamura, and at the summer seminar in Lesneven; both seminars also feature Malcolm Tiki Shewan. In Germany, Yamada teaches a summer seminar at Bernau am Chiemsee. Yamada is well known for his clear and strong basic technique. Beyond his technical ability, he also possesses a gift for passing on his knowledge. His students have become some of the most well-known and high-ranking aikidoka in the Americas. He teaches seminars all over the world where thousands of students attend his classes. He was a direct student of the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, for more than ten years. Yamada is president of the United States Aikido Federation and chairman of the Latin America Aikido Federation. In January 2011, Yamada accepted an invitation to become the patron of Aikikai Australia. He is the author of the book Aikido Complete, and has made multiple aikido training tapes, including the \\"Power and the Basics\\" series, which outlines the requirements for rank testing of all levels. With the deaths of his colleagues Akira Tohei in 1999, Mitsunari Kanai in 2004, and Seiichi Sugano and Nobuyoshi Tamura in 2010, Yamada is one of the most senior living representatives of the last generation of direct students of Morihei Ueshiba. In February 2010 Yoshimitsu Yamada founded Aikido Sansuikai International during a seminar in Dominican Republic. Aikido Sansuikai International is an organization recognized by Aikikai Hombu Dojo and has affiliated dojos from Latin America and Europe.

It was set up in 2000 to give a voice to the fans, and has since become a major shareholder in the football club using donations from supporters to finance share purchases. It is legally an Industrial and Provident Society although it is set up as a not-for-profit organisation, with any surplus in revenue reinvested in either share purchases in the club, or in its various running costs and projects. In February 2011, CFU announced its plans to gain a controlling interest in Cambridge United and to turn it into a Community Trust Club. This followed the news that the club's owners had put the club up for sale, citing the need for new investment to take the club forward. Aims CFU was initially formed as a supporters group to represent the views and interests of Cambridge United's fanbase, and to allow the club's continued operation. It also aimed to give fans a voice within the club through gaining a seat on the club's board, which they achieved in 2004 with the election of Brian Attmore as the first Fans' Elected Director. =Vision= After celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2010, CFU refocussed its attention to develop its vision for the next decade. It developed a Vision Statement sub-categorised into the various projects in which it has an interest: * The club - Cambridge United Football Club is run as a sustainable business at whatever level of football, is central to the local community and with the fans fully represented at all levels. * The organisation - CFU is run on a prudent and sustainable basis, representing all members and all fans. * The community - CFU actively represents members and fans in the local community and with statutory, business and non-profit organisations. * The stadium - Cambridge United's stadium meets the needs of supporters on match days, is commercially sustainable for the club and provides a vibrant resource for the wider community. * Values - CFU is welcoming and inclusive, forward thinking, with a positive attitude to challenge. Achievements Through CFU, fans of Cambridge United have a say in the running of the club. Since 2004 the Fans Elected Director, chosen by CFU members, has represented supporters' interests in the boardroom. We have provided assistance and support to many supporters and raised concerns when required. CFU has become one of the largest shareholders and we seek to grow our shareholding and influence at boardroom level. In November 2003, CFU helped save the club by raising ¬£100,000 as part of the Bridge the Gap campaign. In the following years, the financial and practical assistance we provided was crucial to Cambridge United surviving Administration. Our support has paid players' wages in difficult times. CFU has provided financial and administrative support for the Smile Scheme, bringing many groups and individuals into contact with Cambridge United for the first time. The scheme is now sponsored and is increasingly important within the local community. CFU has financed and provided all administration for the Junior U's scheme during the past few years. This has welcomed many new young supporters and families to the club, with over 2000 children becoming Junior U's over the years. We have also run football tournaments involving hundreds of local youngsters. CFU has helped towards the launch of Supporters' Trusts at Peterborough United, Cambridge City and King's Lynn. We have provided both guidance and advice on a regular basis to a number of other clubs and trusts. Within the supporters' trust movement CFU are well respected and in 2004 we won 'Trust of the Year'. CFU introduced and developed the South Stand scheme, which has seen thousands of people come to matches and also raised awareness of the club to many thousands of others. CFU have provided finance and administrative support to ensure the schemes' success. For the past 10 years, CFU has supported Cambridge United Youth Development via finance, material items and practical assistance. We have sponsored CRC and the Youth Team as well as sponsoring individual players such as Michael Morrison. This season we will again be CRC's Match Day Sponsor and we are sponsoring goalkeeper Martin Trunca. CFU members have freely donated their services, skills and time throughout the past ten years, working hard in many roles within the club. For example, CFU helped carry out work to improve the office portacabins, the fans' bar and the gym at the R Costings Abbey. Over the years, CFU have also donated many items ranging from training goals, bicycles, computers, televisions and radios for the blind. CFU has instigated numerous projects to raise funds for our club. We have organised raffles, beer festivals, football tournaments, produced calendars, DVDs and fixture list posters in order to raise thousands of pounds for Cambridge United F.C. and Cambridge United Youth Development. Our support has also contributed significantly to the transfer funds available to the manager. In 2010 CFU launched the \\"Cambridge 'Til I Die\\" book project. This will be a collection of supporters' memories and stories, providing a unique record of Cambridge United's history from the fans' perspective.

They are set in a dystopian future in which people are allowed to live only one day of the week. For the rest of the six days they are \\"stoned,\\" a kind of suspended animation. The novels focus on a man, Jeff Caird, who is a daybreaker: someone who lives more than one day a week. As the series progresses, the main character seems to be suffering from dissociative identity disorder. The novels comprising the trilogy are: * Dayworld (1985) * Dayworld Rebel (1987) * Dayworld Breakup (1990) In 2016, a prequel to the trilogy, Dayworld: A Hole in Wednesday, by Philip Jos√© Farmer and Danny Adams, was published. Adams also collaborated with Farmer on the short novel The City Beyond Play. Plot background Jeff Caird is a citizen of Tuesday-World N.E. (New Era) 1330. The book starts on D5-W1 (Day-Five, Week-One) in the Second Month of N.E. 1330. (Each day of the week is the same day number, i.e. Sun-Sat will still be D5-W1). The book takes place over a full week, from Tuesday- World D5-W1 to Tuesday-World D6-W1. Jeff Caird is an 'organic' (police officer) by profession. Each day of the week organics have a different outfit. Also, each day of the week has a different fashion trend, TV shows, news, and so on, most people only knowing about each in his or her own day. However, Jeff Caird is a daybreaker, and not only that, he's an immer. The immers are a group of individuals living and acting beneath the radar of the government. The goal of the immers is to slowly and subtly change the government for the better. There are immers in just about every aspect of society in each day of the week. Jeff Caird is special in that he is a daybreaker as sanctioned by the immers, used to pass messages from day to day. As a daybreaker, Caird has mentally created a different identity for himself for each day of the week, different jobs, different friends, and different wives all included. Stoners A stoner is the device which triggers the suspended animation which each and every citizen of the respective day must, by law, be in by 11:30 PM. At 11:35 (in accordance with a five-minute grace period) the stoners turn on and the occupant is essentially frozen in time, resembling a stone statue. At 12:15 AM the following morning, citizens of the current day are de- stoned. A stoner resembles a cylindrical upright capsule with a circular window in the door.

John Van Zandt (died 1847) was an abolitionist who aided the Underground Railroad resistance movement in Ohio after having been a slaveholder in Kentucky. Sued for monetary damages by a slaveholder whose escaped slaves he aided, he was a party to Jones v. Van Zandt (1847), a case by which abolitionists intended to challenge the constitutionality of slavery. The case was decided by the United States Supreme Court against Van Zandt; it upheld the right of Congress and the obligation of the government to protect slavery, as it was established under the Constitution. Van Zandt was ruined financially by the decision and died later that year. Background While living in Evendale, Ohio, Van Zandt often illegally harbored slaves in the basement of his house and helped them escape to the North. In the 1840s, he was caught. He was excommunicated from the Sharon Methodist Episcopal Church, which had already joined the Southern portion of the national congregations, although he was a trustee and had helped found it. They judged his anti-slavery activities to be \\"immoral and un-Christian conduct.\\" Despite this, he continued to harbor slaves, but was caught again. Van Zandt was charged for monetary damages by Wharton Jones, a slaveholder who lost his property, in what became known as Jones v. Van Zandt (1847), which was settled by the US Supreme Court. Abolitionists pressed the case to challenge the constitutionality of slavery. Despite being defended by Salmon P. Chase, future Secretary of Treasury for Abraham Lincoln and Chief Justice of the United States from 1864-1873, Van Zandt was ruled against by the court. In a decision by Chase's predecessor, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the court determined that slavery was protected by the Constitution, and the federal government had the right and obligation to support it; thus the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law was constitutional. States could determine whether slavery would be legal within their borders. Through years of challenging his legal case, Van Zandt lost all his land and property. 'He sleeps now in the obscure grave of a martyr. The \\"gigantic frame\\" of which the novelist speaks was worn down at last by want of sleep, exposure and anxiety ; and his spirits were depressed by the persecutions which were accumulated on him. Several slave- owners who had lost their property by his means sued him in the United States Courts for damages ; and judgment after judgment stripped him of his farm and all his property.' He had to place his eleven children with relatives across the country. He died later that year. Aftermath Hoping to settle the issue of slavery, Chief Justice Taney increased sectional tensions in the nation. In 1850 Southerners pushed through a new Fugitive Slave Act that required states to support enforcement and increased the penalties for those aiding escaped slaves. It also added to the tensions across the country. Legacy and honors On June 19, 2005, the Sharonville United Methodist Church (the pro- slavery Southern faction rejoined the mainline Methodist Church in the 20th century) attracted national press attention when it posthumously restored Van Zandt's membership. About a dozen Van Zandt descendants traveled to the city to accept a formal letter of apology by the church for the expulsion of their ancestor for his anti-slavery activities. In popular culture Van Zandt was believed to have been the basis for the character of Van Trompe in Harriet Beecher Stowe's bestselling Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), which helped rouse anti- slavery activists., 'Some Account of Mrs Beecher Stowe and Her Family, by an Alabama Man': '...the pious and lion-hearted JOHN VANZANDT, who features in chapter nine of Uncle Tom's Cabin, as John Van Trompe.'

He is by far the best known son of Ramesses II, and his contributions to Egyptian society were remembered for centuries after his death.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004), p. 170-171 Khaemweset has been described as \\"the first Egyptologist\\" due to his efforts in identifying and restoring historic buildings, tombs and temples.  Life  According to historian Miriam Lichtheim: :Here I should like to stress that Prince Setne Khamwas, the hero of the two tales named for him, was a passionate antiquarian. The historical prince Khamwas, was the fourth son of King Ramses II, had been high priest of Ptah at Memphis and administrator of all the Memphite sanctuaries. In that capacity he had examined decayed tombs, restored the names of their owners, and renewed their funerary cults. Posterity had transmitted his renown, and the Demotic tales that were spun around his memory depicted him and his fictional adversary Prince Naneferkaptah as very learned scribes and magicians devoted to the study of ancient monuments and writings. =Youth and military training= Khaemweset was the second son of Ramesses II and Queen Isetnofret. He was born during the reign of his grandfather Pharaoh Seti I and the fourth son overall. In about the 13th year of the reign of Seti I, crown- prince Ramesses put down a minor revolt in Nubia. Ramesses took his small sons Amunherwenemef and Khaemweset with him on this military campaign. Khaemweset may have been only 4 years old at this time. Khaemweset and his older brother are shown making a charge on the battle field in a chariot. The events were recorded in scenes in the temple at Beit el Wali.Kitchen, Kenneth A., Pharaoh Triumphant: The Life and Times of Ramesses II, King of Egypt, Aris & Phillips. 1983, pp 40, 89, 102-109, 162, 170, 227-230. Khaemweset grew up with his brothers during a time of foreign conflict and he is present in scenes from the Battle of Kadesh, the siege of Qode (Naharin), and the siege of Dapur in Syria. In the battle of Kadesh scenes from year 5 of Ramesses II, Khaemweset is shown leading sons of the chiefs of Hatti before the gods. These princes were prisoners of war. In scenes depicting the battle of Qode, Khaemweset is shown both leading prisoners before his father and serving as an attendant of his father. In year 10 of Ramesses II Khaemweset is present during the battle of Dapur. =Priesthood= Pectoral and buckle found in the Saqqara burial of prince Kaemwese After this initial period where Khaemweset may have had some military training, or at least was present at the battlefield, he became a Sem-Priest of Ptah in Memphis. This appointment occurred in c. Year 16 of Ramesses II's reign. He would have initially been a deputy to the High Priest of Ptah in Memphis named Huy. During his time as Sem-Priest Khaemweset was quite active in rituals, including the burial of several Apis bulls at the Serapeum. In year 16 of Ramesses, the Apis bull died and was buried in the Serapeum. Funerary gifts were presented by the High Priest of Ptah, Huy, Khaemweset himself, his brother Prince Ramesses, and Vizier Paser. The next burial took place in year 30 and at that time the gifts came from the chief of the treasury Suty and the Mayor of Memphis named Huy. After this second burial Khaemweset redesigned the Serapeum. He created an underground gallery where a series of burial chambers allowed for the burial of several Apis bulls. =Heb-Sed festivals= Around the 25th regnal year of his father, his older brother Ramesses became crown prince, and in the 30th year, Khaemweset's name started to appear in the announcements of the Sed festivals. These were traditionally held in Memphis, but some of the announcements were made in Upper Egypt at El Kab and Gebel el-Silsila. While he was a Sem priest, Khaemweset may have constructed and built additions to the temple of Ptah in Memphis. There are several inscriptions which attest to Khaemweset's activities in Memphis.Kitchen, K.A., Ramesside Inscriptions, Translated & Annotated, Translations, Volume II, Blackwell Publishers, 1996 Head of Khaemwaset =Restoring ancient monuments= Khaemweset restored the monuments of earlier kings and nobles. Restoration texts were found associated with the pyramid of Unas at Saqqara, the tomb of Shepseskaf called the Mastabat al- Fir‚Äôaun, the sun-Temple of Nyuserre Ini, the Pyramid of Sahure, the Pyramid of Djoser, and the Pyramid of Userkaf. Inscriptions at the pyramid temple of Userkaf show Khaemweset with offering bearers, and at the pyramid temple of Sahure Khamwaset offers a statue of the goddess Bast. Khaemweset restored a statue of Prince Kawab, a son of King Khufu. The inscription on the throne reads: ::\\"It is the Chief Directing Artisans and Sem-Priest, the King's Son, Khaemweset, who was glad over this statue of the King's Son Kawab, and who took it from what was cast (away) for debris (?), in [...] .. of his father, the King of South and North Egypt Khufu. Then the S[em-Priest and King's Son, Kha]em[waset] decreed that [it be given] a place of favor of the Gods in company with the excellent Blessed Spirits at the Head of the Spirit (Ka) chapel of Ro-Setjau, ‚Äì so greatly did he love antiquity and the noble folk who were aforetime, along with the excellence (of) all that they had made, so well, and repeatedly (\\"a million times\\"). These (things) shall be for (for) all life, stability and prosperity, enduring upon earth, [for the Chief Directing Artisans and Sem-Priest, the King's Son, Khaemwaset, after he has (re)established all their cult procedures of this temple, which had fallen into oblivion [in the remembrance] of men. He has dug a pool before the noble sanctuary (?), in work (agreeing) with his wishes, while pure channels existed, for purity, and to bring libations from (?) the reservoir (?) of Khefren, that he may attain (the status of) \\"given life\\". Some of these restorations took place during his later tenure as Sem priest. The work on the pyramid of Djoser is dated to year 36 of Ramesses II. Some of the inscriptions mention Khaemweset's title as \\"Chief of the Artificers\\" or \\"Chief of Crafts\\". Hence, some of these restorations were undertaken after his promotion as the High Priest of Ptah in Memphis about the 45th year of the reign of Ramesses II. =Crown prince= Khaemweset held the position of Crown Prince to the throne between Year 50 and Year 55 of his father's reign when he died. He was succeeded in this position by his full brother Merneptah. He also served as Governor of Memphis. Family Aswan Rock stela. Top: Ramesses II, Isetnofret and Khaemwaset before Khnum. Bottom left to right: Merneptah, Bintanath and Prince Ramesses. Khaemweset was the son of Ramesses II and Queen Isetnofret. He had at least two brothers: Prince Ramesses was his elder brother and Merneptah was his younger brother. Bintanath was his sister. These three siblings are depicted on the Aswan Rock stela with the Pharaoh and Queen shown with Khaemweset in another register. It is possible that Princess Isetnofret was a full sister of Khaemwaset as well, although it is equally possible she was only a half-sister. Khaemweset is known to have had two sons and a daughter. His eldest son, Ramesses, is mentioned on a block statue from Memphis. Ramesses holds the title \\"King's Son\\" on the statue, which here should be interpreted as King's grandson. On the Dorsal Pillar the text reads: \\"[It is] his dear [son] who perpetuates his name - The King's Son, excellent in wisdom, upright in mind in every deed, great in his enlightenment at all times to maintain the offerings for his father, ‚Äì the King's Son Ramesses, justified and venerated one.\\" His second son, Hori, became High Priest of Ptah at Memphis during the later part of the 19th Dynasty. Khaemweset is also known to have had a daughter named Isetnofret (also written as Isitnofret). Other women at court with that name include her grandmother Queen Isetnofret and her father‚Äôs sister. Khaemweset's daughter Isetnofret may have married her uncle, the pharaoh Merneptah. If so, she would be identical to Queen Isetnofret II. Isetnofret's tomb may have recently been found in Saqqara during excavations by Waseda University.Tomb of Isetnofret Discovered in Saqqara Not much is known about Khaemweset's wife, though in the demotic story, Setna II, his wife bears the name Meheweskhe.William Kelly Simpson and Robert Kriech Ritner, The Literature of Ancient Egypt, Yale University Press (2003), p. 490 One grandson of his is known. His son Hori had a son who was also named Hori. This grandson of Khaemweset would later serve as Vizier of Egypt during the tumultuous period at the end of the Nineteenth Dynasty. He was still performing these duties under Ramesses III. Burial Shabti of Khaemweset (Khamwaset, Kha-em-was), son of Ramesses II. The head is missing. Black steatite. 19th Dynasty. From Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Whilst first exploring the Serapeum of Saqqara between 1851 and 1853, French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette was confronted by a huge rock, which could only be moved by the use of explosives. Once the shattered remnants of the rock were removed, an intact coffin was discovered which contained the mummy of a man, accompanied by numerous funerary treasures. A gold mask covered his face, and amulets gave his name as Prince Khaemweset, son of Ramesses II and builder of the Serapeum. These remains have now been lost but Egyptologists believe that this was not the grave of Khaemweset and that the remains were those of an Apis Bull made into a human form to resemble the Prince. The Egyptologist Aidan Dodson is quoted writing in his book \\"Canopic Equipment from the Serapeum of Memphis\\": Gold mask with the likeness of Khaemweset from the Apis bull burial. ::\\"Designated Apis XIV, it comprised a wooden sarcophagus, largely embedded in the ground, with its upper part largely crushed. Inside, there was what had the appearance of a human mummy, its face covered by a somewhat crude gold mask, damaged by damp and bearing a considerable quantity of jewelry, some bearing the name of Prince Khaemweset. ::In spite of its appearance, the mummy proved to be a mass of fragrant resin, containing a quantity of disordered bone. Although frequently stated to be the mummy of Khaemweset, on the basis of its possessing his jewelry, the mass of resin containing bony fragments is far more reminiscent of the undoubted Apis of tombs E and G. Its formation into the simulacrum of a human mummy also finds echo in the anthropoid coffin lids that covered the resinous masses within the sarcophagi of Apis VII and IX, there can thus be no doubt that the burial is actually that of the bull, Apis XIV.\\"Aidan Dodson, Canopic Equipment from the Serapeum of Memphis, A. Leahy and W.J. Tait (eds) (1999) Pectoral from Khaemweset's Serapeum tomb burial bearing Ramesses II's cartouche.

Khaemweset in Ancient Egyptian fiction In later periods of Egyptian history, Khaemweset was remembered as a wise man, and portrayed as the hero in a cycle of stories dating to the Hellenistic period. In these stories his name is Setne, a distortion of the real Khaemwaset's title as setem-priest of Ptah; modern scholars call this character \\"Setne Khamwas\\".Lichtheim, Miriam, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume III: The Late Period, University of California Press, 2006 [1980], pp. 125‚Äì126 The first tale, dubbed Setne I or Setne Khamwas and Naneferkaptah, describes how Khaemwaset seeks and finds a book of powerful magical spells, the Book of Thoth, in the tomb of Prince Naneferkaptah. Against the wishes of Naneferkaptah's spirit, Khaemwaset takes the book and becomes cursed. Setne then meets a beautiful woman who seduces him into killing his children and humiliating himself in front of the pharaoh. He discovers that this episode was an illusion created by Neferkaptah, and in fear of further retribution, Setne returns the book to Neferkaptah's tomb. At Neferkaptah's request, Setne also finds the bodies of Neferkaptah's wife and son and buries them in Neferkaptah's tomb, which is then sealed.Lichtheim 2006, pp. 127‚Äì137 The second tale is known as Setne II or the Tale of Setne Khamwas and Si-Osire. Khaemwaset and his wife have a son named Si-Osire who turns out to be a highly skilled magician. In the first part of the story, Si-Osire brings his father to visit the Duat, the land of the dead, where they see the pleasant fate of the deceased spirits who lived justly and the torments inflicted on spirits who sinned during their lives. In the second part, it is revealed that Si- Osire is actually a famous magician from the time of Thutmose III who returned to save Egypt from a Nubian magician. After the confrontation, Si-Osire disappears, and Khaemwaset and his wife have a real son who is also named Si- Osire in honor of the magician.Lichtheim 2006, pp. 138‚Äì151 Popular culture * In The Kane Chronicles book The Serpent's Shadow, Khaemweset appears as a ghost under the name of Setne. Unlike contemporary and fictional portrayals by the Egyptians, he is portrayed as a ruthless and power-hungry priest who wants to become a god. On the other hand, he is known to be extremely charismatic and can persuade people to agree to his line of thinking. At the end of the book, he steals the Book of Thoth and begins to dabble in Greek and Egyptian magic in later related media. He is defeated by the Kanes, Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase in the end and imprisoned in a miniature snowglobe. * Khaemwaset appears in the game Age of Mythology under the name of Setna, where he is portrayed as a priest of Osiris rather than Ptah. * Khaemwaset is the protagonist of Pauline Gedge's novel \\"Scroll of Saqqara\\".

He showed that a random draw could explain some patterns having to do with island biota.Simberloff, D. S., (1970). Taxonomic Diversity of Island Biota. Evolution 24:23-47. Meanwhile, a number of biologists, Jared Diamond the most eloquent of them, began calling for island biogeography theory to be applied in conservation.Diamond, J. M. (1975). The Island Dilemma: Lessons of Island Biogeography for the Design of Nature Reserves. Biological Conservation. 7:129-146. This became a controversy in ecology known as SLOSS. In his 1976 Science paper, Simberloff contradicted his own theory, claiming that most of the insect turnover in the assemblages studied was ephemeral and did not, therefore, confirm island biogeography theory in general. In fact, two smaller areas could mathematically support more species than a single area of the same size, and he had experimental data from his some mangrove studies to support itSimberloff, D. S., and L, G. Abele. (1976). Science 191:285-286.. A leading exponent of the theory now writes that ‚Äúthe species-area curve is a blunt tool in many contexts‚Äù and ‚Äúnow seems simplistic to the point of being cartoonish‚Äù when it comes to management of nature preserves.Laurance, W. F. (2008). Theory Meets reality: How Habitat Fragmentation Research has Transcended Island Biogeographic Theory. Biological Conservation 141:1731-44. There are more urgent concerns facing conservation biology than SLOSS. Immediately on the heals of and related to the controversy of island biogeography theory, Simberloff took on the MacArthurian paradigm of competitively structured communities, championing the use of null modelsGotelli, N. J., and R. G. Graves. (1996). Null Models in Ecology. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. in community ecology. Debate on the subject in the ecological literature became so heated that it inspired the name of \\"Tallassee mafia\\" for Simberloff and his associates at Florida State University.Lewin, R. (1983).

Simberloff caused ecologists to question, ‚Äúwhat would happen if one mechanism were removed?‚Äù He preached, ‚Äúrely on the data to tell you how nature operates; don‚Äôt simply find the patterns that you‚Äôre supposed to find.‚Äù The Ecological Society of America in conferring him its 2006 Eminent Ecologist Award for his \\"outstanding body of ecological work\\" and \\"contributions of extraordinary merit,\\" citing him in particular for having been \\"the quintessential ecological iconoclast.\\"https://www.esa.org/history/Awards/bulletin/eminent2006.pdf Simberloff was instrumental in making the presidential Executive order 13112 on invasive species, and he also serves on the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group and the IUCN Species Survival Commission. He has served on the Board of Governors of the Nature Conservancy, the federal Invasive Species Advisory Committee, and the editorial boards of Biodiversity and Conservation, Oecologia, Biological Invasions, BioScience and Ecology. Simberloff was a faculty member at Florida State University from 1968-1997 before relocating to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is currently a distinguished professor there in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. He directs the University of Tennessee‚Äôs Institute for Biological Invasions. His more recent work focuses on the presence of invasive species, and raises the ‚Äúspecter of ‚Äòinvasional meltdown‚Äô‚Äù. At present, Simberloff has a long-term project in Patagonia on the invasion of conifer trees, involving introduced deer, boar, and fungi. Simberloff has a total of over 350 publications, and he is currently working on several papers on invasive biology. Personal Favorite Projects The series of projects on insect communities on small mangrove islands, which started with his doctoral dissertation, was Simberloff's earliest major contribution to the field of ecology. Simberloff is also recognized for a long series of papers on different statistical analyses of patterns and what they can tell us about underlying ecological mechanisms, especially which species are where, and the different sizes of coexisting species. This includes the work with Tamar Dayan on character displacement and on assembly rules and species combinations with Ed Connor and Michael Collins. This research caused a major shift in how researchers analyze pattern data. Simberloff is currently engaged in a set of ongoing research projects in Patagonia on conifer invasions.

Most species are small trees about tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems. They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple- black fruit. The genus is most closely related to several other spiny palms‚ÄîAcrocomia, Aiphanes, Astrocaryum and Desmoncus. The fruit of several species is edible, most notably B. gasipaes, while others are used medicinally or for construction. The ancestors of the genus are believed to have entered South America during the late Cretaceous. Bactris shows high rates of speciation. Description Both stems and leaves of Bactris species are generally covered with spines. Stems generally bear spines on the internodes; in B. glaucescens and B. setulosa spines are also present on the nodes. A few species lack spines on their stems. All species have spiny leaves; the spines are often clustered on the petiole or rachis. In some species the spines are only found on the tips of the leaflets. Most species grow in multi-stemmed clumps with stems about tall and in diameter, but they span a range of sizes from tall trees to shrubs with subterranean stems and are sometimes single- stemmed. Stems can be as narrow as in B.aubletiana or as broad as in B. gasipaes. The leaves can be either pinnately compound or simple; in some species like B. hirta both types of leaves exist. Petioles range from to over in length, while the rachis (which bears the leaflets) can be to over long. Inflorescences are borne singly emerging from the leaf axil. Flowers grow in triplets along the inflorescence; each female flower is flanked by two male flowers; elsewhere along the inflorescence male flowers grow singly or in pairs. Ripe fruit can be yellow, orange, red or purple-black (other colours are present in a few species) and range from long. Taxonomy Bactris is placed in the subfamily Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Bactridinae, together with the genera Acrocomia, Aiphanes, Astrocaryum and Desmoncus. Phylogenetic studies support the monophyly of both the subtribe Bactridinae and the genus Bactris, but differ in terms of how the genera within the subtribe are related to one-another. The first species were attributed to the genus by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1763, but a formal description of the genus was only published in 1777 by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. Later workers split Bactris into several genera (Guilielma, Augustinea, Pyrenoglyphis, Amylocarpus and Yuyba) and described several hundred species. Although earlier authors recognised between 239 and 257 species of Bactris, Andrew Henderson accepted 73 species and a single genus in his 2000 monograph, while as of 2013 The Plant List included 79 accepted species. Henderson recognised six informal groups within the genus, but used them only for convenience and did not consider them monophyletic groups. These groups were (1) the Amylocarpus group, (2) the Guilielma group, (3) the Orange-fruited group, (4) the Piranga group, (5) the Purple-fruited group, and (6) the Pyrenoglyphis group. In their study of the Bactridinae, Wolf Eiserhardt and colleagues sampled 13 species of Bactris distributed among these six groups; five of these groups were represented by more than one species in their sample. Of these five, only the Guilielma group was potentially monophyletic (although support for this conclusion was weak). The other four were found to be either polyphyletic or paraphyletic (although here again, support was only strong for two of the four). The sixth group, the Orange-fruited group, was only represented by a single species in their data set. ; Species: =Evolutionary history= The subfamily Arecoideae is believed to have evolved in North America about 78 million years ago, and colonised South America during the late Cretaceous before going extinct in North America. The subtribe Bactridinae evolved between 54 and 35 million years ago, The ancestors of Bactris diverged from those of Astroacryum between 26 and 36 million years ago. In an analysis of the palm family, it was found that Bactris was one of six palm genera that showed the highest rates of speciation. Distribution The genus ranges from Mexico, through Central America and the Caribbean and across much of tropical South America. Diversity is highest in the Amazonian region. Most of the species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest are endemic to the region. Three species (B. cubensis, B. jamaicana and B. plumeriana) are restricted to the Caribbean and form a closely related clade. Uses Bactris gasipaes, the peyibaye or peach palm, was domesticated in pre-Columbian times and is cultivated for its starchy fruit and palm heart throughout the Neotropics, especially in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Costa Rica. Other species used for food include B. brongniartii, B. campestris, B. concinna and B. major. Bactris acanthophora and B. campestris are used medicinally, while B. barronis, B. pilosa and B. setulosa are used in construction.

Biography Bernhard Ernst von B√ºlow He was the son of Adolf von B√ºlow, a Danish official, and was born at Cismar in Holstein. His own son Bernhard von B√ºlow was also a German statesman and chancellor. He studied law at the universities of Berlin, G√∂ttingen and Kiel, and began his political career in the service of Denmark, in the chancery of Schleswig- Holstein-Lauenburg at Copenhagen, and afterwards in the foreign office. In 1842 he became councillor of legation, and in 1847 Danish charge d'affaires in the Hanse towns, where his intercourse with the merchant princes led to his marriage in 1848 with a wealthy heiress, Louise Victorine R√ºcker. Their children included Bernhard, Adolf, Alfred and Waldemar (died age 2). When the insurrection broke out in the Elbe duchies (1848) he left the Danish service, and offered his services to the provisional government of Kiel, an offer that was not accepted. In 1849, accordingly, he re-entered the service of Denmark, was appointed a royal chamberlain and in 1850 sent to represent the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein at the restored federal diet of Frankfurt. Here he came into intimate touch with Bismarck, who admired his statesmanlike handling of the growing complications of the Schleswig-Holstein Question. With the radical Eider-Dane party he was utterly out of sympathy; and when, in 1862, this party gained the upper hand, he was recalled from Frankfurt. He now entered the service of the Grand-duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and remained at the head of the grand-ducal government until 1867, when he became plenipotentiary for the two Mecklenburg duchies in the council of the German Confederation (Bundesrat), where he distinguished himself by his successful defence of the medieval constitution of the duchies against Liberal attacks. In 1873 Bismarck, who was in thorough sympathy with his views, persuaded him to enter the service of Prussia as secretary of state for foreign affairs, and from this time until his death he was the chancellor's most faithful henchman. In 1875, he was appointed Prussian plenipotentiary in the Bundesrat; in 1877 he became Bismarck's lieutenant in the secretaryship for foreign affairs of the Empire; and in 1878 he was, with Bismarck and Hohenlohe, Prussian plenipotentiary at the congress of Berlin. He died at Frankfurt on 20 October 1879, his end being hastened by his exertions in connection with the political crisis of that year. Of his six sons the eldest, Bernhard Heinrich Karl, became chancellor of the Empire. Notes References *Chancellor Von Bulows Memoirs, Vol.IV.

History They originated in Tacoma, Washington where Ryann, Steve, and Jonah attended Charles Wright Academy, a private school in University Place. They first garnered attention in 2003, after winning second place in Experience Music Project's Sound Off! Competition. They continued on to make a debut album, The Funeral Sciences. 2005 saw the release of their second effort, Fantastic Wounds and a nationwide tour with Vendetta Red. They have been featured in the Seattle newspaper The Stranger. Singer Ryann Donnelly claims that the band has its roots in the year 2000, when she and the band attempted to play a cover of a Misfits song, \\"Last Caress\\", but were cut off due to offensive lyricism (they were playing a Christian Battle of the Bands function). The Heroes entered the studio on January 16, 2007, to record their third full-length record, titled Abominations. Recording wrapped on February 3, 2007, and the album was released on September 18, 2007 on a major-label, Stolen Transmission, for the first time. The band announced a nationwide tour to showcase their new album. On March 20, 2007, Schoolyard Heroes debuted a song on their PureVolume music page. \\"Dude, Where's My Skin?\\" went on to become the website's most downloaded song of the day. After a short 24-hour stint, the song was removed. In early 2008, the band completed a nationwide tour, opening for the Seattle-based band Aiden. The band announced their breakup on November 20, 2009. On December 30, 2009, the band posted an announcement on their Myspace about a \\"new project\\" that they called Blood Cells.This is a band featuring both Jonah Bergman and Ryann Donnelly, as well as two new members. Their musical style is extremely similar to that of the Schoolyard Heroes, and they had announced through their email newsletter that they are working on new material, but later said it was an error. After a handful of Blood Cells shows, Ryann returned to playing dance pop solo shows and moved to New York. She has been releasing new songs through her own label The Lonely Hearts Singles Club. In 2011, Jonah Bergman joined a resurrected Vendetta Red. On July 26th 2013 Jonah Bergman released ‚ÄúTash Life Ep‚Äù by Trash Fire. He‚Äôs new band featuring Seattle area musicians such as Mark Gajadhar of The Blood Brothers on guitar. In 2014, the Schoolyard Heroes reunited for a single show at the annual Bumbershoot music festival.

The school bus, driven by a substitute driver, was stopped at a traffic light with the rearmost portion extending onto a portion of the railroad tracks when it was struck by a Metra Union Pacific / Northwest Line train en route to Chicago. The crash involved a signalled rail crossing located very near a highway intersection which was regulated by traffic signals. The devices were connected and operations were supposed to be carefully timed and coordinated. Such locations are known as \\"interconnected crossings\\" within the industries. Highway and railroad officials had each received numerous complaints from the public about the insufficient timing of the warnings provided by the signals in the year prior to the crash, and citizens later told of situations with vehicles unable to clear the tracks in a timely manner. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that, while the bus driver was not aware that a portion of the bus was on the tracks as she should have been, the timing of signals was so insufficient that, even if she had identified the hazard as the train approached, she would have had to proceed against a red traffic signal into the highway intersection to have moved out of the train's path. Legislation and re-engineering of interconnected crossings across the state of Illinois combined with greater awareness elsewhere resulted in efforts to help to prevent similar crashes from recurring. Informational decals were also added to Illinois school buses advising drivers of the length of each bus, since the substitute school bus driver was apparently unaware of the exact length of the bus she was driving. Other states have also embraced that and related aspects and incorporated them into their school bus driver training curriculum.Ohio Pupil Transportation Safety Commission (Spring 2007). Safety News & Views . Vol. 2, issue 3. Accessed May 10, 2008. The Fox River Grove crash stands as the worst crash involving a Metra train in its history, and one of the worst grade crossing crashes in U.S. history. At the crash site, the improved signaling system installed after the crash now protects the passing trains and motor vehicle traffic. Nearby is a small memorial to the seven high school students killed in the crash.  Summary  On October 25, 1995, at 7:10 am CDT, Metra train number 624, traveling approximately 60 mph (96 km/h) at the time of impact, collided with the back of a school bus carrying students to Cary-Grove High School at the intersection of Algonquin Road, Northwest Highway (U.S. Route 14), and a double-tracked mainline belonging to the Union Pacific Railroad. The impact separated the body from the chassis of the bus and catapulted the wreckage into the intersection. Five students were instantly killed and two later died from their injuries. Another 21 were injured, some critically. Most victims suffered blunt trauma and head injuries. The most seriously injured suffered skull fractures, lacerations and internal injuries. The train Metra 624 was in push mode, which meant the engineer was in a specially designed cab car (no. 8751), equipped with a control panel at its end, for the engineer to operate the train from this car, while the power was coming from the locomotive, set in reverse, at the other end, pushing the train. This operation negates the time and track needed to change the physical direction of the train. The train consisted of 6 standard bi-level passenger cars and the cab car, totaling 7 cars, with the locomotive at the back. The locomotive believed to have been pushing the train at the time was Metra EMD F40PH-3 number 148, named Village of Fox Lake, although the locomotive number was not identified in accident/incident reports from the bus collision. Train 624 was scheduled to depart Crystal Lake Station at 7:00 am, which it departed on time, bound for Chicago. 624, in particular, was affectionately known as the \\"Flyer\\", because it skipped most stations along the way, with an authorized speed limit of . Metra 624 struck the bus at 7:10 am, roughly 10 minutes after departure. Timeline General diagram of the scene. The train approached from the west, while the bus was stopped on the north side of the tracks All times are approximate, given in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report as the best approximation of when the events occurred as a result of their investigation.

The thumbwheel on the device calculates the speed of the train, which is at this point . The train is from the center of the crossing. The device determines that it can safely wait eight seconds to notify the highway system of the train's approach. * 24 seconds before impact: Rail system notifies the highway system of the train's approach. The train is from the crossing, and its speed is unchanged. * 23 seconds before impact: Preemption cycle for the traffic signal begins; lights on U.S. 14 prepare to change to red, but pedestrian traffic must be given time to clear the intersection.

Causes =Failure of judgment= The initial cause of the crash was the failure of the bus driver to properly judge the distance between the railroad tracks when the vehicle stopped at a traffic signal across the tracks. The failure of judgment meant that around of the back end of the bus protruded over the nearest rail. The body of the Metra train protruded past the rail. All of the injuries were sustained during this initial impact. The crossing was of inherently dangerous design, in that a long vehicle could be partially trapped on the crossing while held by a red light at the intersection. If the driver had realized the danger, she would still have been forced to pull through a red light to clear the track when the warning bells sounded. Children began joking that Catencamp was oblivious to the fact that a crossing gate lowered on the bus, then began screaming for her to move forward. She did not understand their message and diverted her attention away from the traffic signal. NTSB concluded the traffic signal did turn green 6 seconds before impact, but Catencamp was distracted trying to attend to what she presumed was some crisis within the bus. =Highway reconstruction= The position of the bus when it was hit by the train. The driver was unaware that the position of her vehicle was unsafe As with most transportation crashes, there were other conditions present that created an environment in which this type of collision could occur. These causes take root in the history of the road, the railroad, and the crossing. Prior to the early 1990s, the Northwest Highway ran as a two-lane road (one lane in each direction) parallel to the former Chicago & North Western rail line (Union Pacific Railroad after April 1995). The distance between the road and the railroad is relatively constant in the state‚Äîroughly 60 feet (18.2 meters), assuming a two-lane road and impediment-free alignment. This distance was more than enough to hold a 40-foot (12.2 meter) bus. When the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) reconstructed the highway to encourage development in the area and limit congestion, three lanes were added to the road to create a four-lane highway with turn lanes at the intersection. To limit the impact of the road expansion to businesses on the northern side of the highway, IDOT reduced the distance between the road and the railroad from 60 feet to around 30 feet (9.1 meters). They also erected a modernized traffic signal to ensure traffic cleared the crossing in front of an approaching train. These actions increased the chances of a train impacting a school bus, but were not leading causes. =Crossing design= The type of crossing where the crash occurred is known as an interconnected crossing because of the need to link the railroad signals to the road signals to ensure safe passage. On this particular route, bus drivers on Algonquin Road had been known to cross the tracks to stop at the line at Northwest Highway, leaving them vulnerable to passing trains if they happened to still be stopped when the gates lowered. In addition, vehicle sensors were only present on the north side of the railroad tracks. Buses, trucks and other large vehicles were forced to pull through the railroad crossing in order to activate the signals at the intersection. =Improper preemption programming= According to tests conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the warning lights on the railroad crossing activated 20 seconds before the arrival of the Metra train. However, the traffic light clearing the rail intersection only allowed cars to clear 18 seconds after the railway signals activated, giving vehicles only 2 to 6 seconds to clear the tracks. Roadway signal timing was under the jurisdiction of IDOT, while railway timing was under the jurisdiction of Union Pacific. No communication took place between both parties with regards to interconnected signal timing. It was reported that the road signals had originally given a safe margin, but had been modified some months previously to allow a pedestrian crossing cycle, overlooking the possible consequences at the railroad crossing. The traffic signal would rest in the \\"WALK\\" indication for pedestrians during the morning commute period. When a train is detected, the pedestrian interval must be ended. This process used up 12 seconds of warning time as the train approached. Pedestrian volumes at this crosswalk were extremely light, according to a survey conducted by the Village of Fox River Grove in May 1996. IDOT traffic engineers responsible for establishing signal timings should have recognized that in this particular case, resting in \\"WALK\\" carries substantial risk and virtually no benefit, and should not have allowed the traffic signal to rest in the pedestrian \\"WALK\\" interval. If the traffic signals had not been serving the non-existent pedestrian, the bus would have had a green light 12 seconds earlier than it did, and the collision would almost certainly have been avoided. In addition, the thumbwheel setting on the crossing processor was reduced to 25 seconds from 30 seconds two weeks before the crash. Union Pacific officials stated that the new value was still above the minimum constant warning time of 20 seconds. Consequences =NTSB recommendations= The National Transportation Safety Board issued 29 distinct recommendations to 17 distinct parties in the aftermath of the crash. These recommendations are summarized as follows: To the U.S. Secretary of Transportation: Develop a safety inspection program for railroad crossings that involve other public entities (schools and other state departments). Notify, in cooperation with AASHTO, other agencies about the importance of exchanging information about railroad/highway crossings. Develop a common glossary of railroad/highway crossing terms and distribute to railroad and public entities. Develop a training program specifically regarding interconnected crossings. Require recording devices on all interconnected crossings in the future, and require their usage when both railroad and joint maintenance is done on the crossing. Upgrade existing recording devices to fulfill the previous condition. To the Federal Highway Administration: Develop a way to visually show on pavement where a train and/or its cargo may be to assist drivers in determining their safe distance from the crossing. Develop, with the cooperation of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Operation Lifesaver, educational materials to inform motorists of how a train and/or its cargo can occupy a crossing. Review the national Highway-Rail Crossing inventory with the Federal Railroad Administration to ensure that it meets the needs of highway users as well. To the Federal Railroad Administration: Update the national Highway-Rail Crossing inventory. Include, at a minimum, grade crossings having pre-emptive or interconnected signals. To the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Determine what effect sound attenuation materials in buses have on the ability of the bus driver to discern both internal and external audible warnings. To the Illinois Department of Transportation: Review all interconnected crossings in Illinois, and ensure that vehicles at all of these crossings have enough space or time to clear the crossing when a train approaches. Train subcontractors to ensure they have proper knowledge of all working interconnected systems. To the Transportation Joint School District 47/155: Develop a program to identify possible hazards on all bus routes. Review the information with both regular and substitute bus drivers regularly. To the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services: Advise their members of the accident and its circumstances. Develop programs for the identification of hazards on bus routes. Develop guidelines for the appropriate placement of radios on school buses. When establishing bus routes, consider unusual operating characteristics or grade crossing accident histories. Advise members to disable radio speakers located next to drivers' heads. In addition, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, National Association of County Engineers, American Public Works Association, Institute of Transportation Engineers, Association of American Railroads, American Short Line Railroad Association and American Public Transit Association were all advised to notify their members of the circumstances of the crash, and distribute information on the importance of exchanging information about railroad/highway grade crossings. In the state of Illinois alone, 188 other interconnected crossings were inspected for hazardous conditions. Of these, 24 had similar problems, and were repaired. =Bus route changes= New route designs brought the number of routes crossing railroad tracks in the District 47 and District 155 school systems down from 70% in 1996 to 10% in 1997. Litigation Lawsuits were filed the month after the crash, and the last of these was resolved in January 2004. A total of $27.3 million was paid to the victims; of this amount, the school district paid $16.26 million, as school districts are held responsible for the actions of their drivers. The Union Pacific Railroad and Metra paid $7 million. Engineering contractors and the Illinois Department of Transportation settled for $3.2 million and $750,000, respectively. Memorial A large granite memorial and two plaques were placed in memory of the seven students killed in the crash near the site, honoring the deceased: Jeffrey J. Clark (17 years old), Michael B. Hoffman (14), Joseph A. Kalte (16), Shawn P. Robinson (14), Tiffany Schneider (15), Stephanie Fulham (15) and Susanna Guzman (18). The Fox River Grove Public Library was renamed the Fox River Grove Memorial Library which includes an outdoor memorial seating area with the names of the seven students. A memorial outside the high school the bus was headed to was added.

The building houses the Connecticut General Assembly; the upper house, the State Senate, and lower house, the House of Representatives, as well as the office of the Governor of the State of Connecticut. The Connecticut Supreme Court (built 1908‚Äì1910) occupies a building across Capitol Avenue. History The current building is the third capitol building for the State of Connecticut since the American Revolution. The General Assembly of Connecticut (state legislature) met alternately in Hartford and New Haven since before the American Revolution. When in Hartford, the General Assembly met in the Old State House, designed in 1792 by Charles Bulfinch, and when sitting in New Haven, in a State House designed in 1827 by Ithiel Town. After the Civil War, the complications of this plan began to be evident, and both Hartford and New Haven competed to be sole state capital. Hartford won, and the new sole capital needed one central capitol building. The General Assembly authorized a million dollar project, and two competitors, James G. Batterson and Richard M. Upjohn, vied to be awarded the project. Upjohn won, but Batterson, a stone importer and merchant and not an architect, was named the building contractor. Batterson then continually revised the Upjohn plan to more and more closely resemble his own plan. The central tower, for example, is Batterson's, not Upjohn's. Batterson's extensive elaboration of Upjohn's plan ended up more than doubling the cost to over $2,500,000. Dome detail The Charter Oak relief above the East entrance, with the busts of Horace Bushnell and Noah Webster above The Genius of Connecticut by sculptor Randolph Rogers (1877‚Äì78), a plaster version of the bronze statue (destroyed) originally mounted on top of the dome, is exhibited on the main floor. Richard M. Upjohn's design is in the Eastlake style, with French and Gothic Revival styled elements. Construction of the building began in 1871. The building was completed in 1878, and it opened for the session of the General Assembly of Connecticut in January 1879.\\"Sites, Seals & Symbols,\\" CT.gov. Retrieved 5 Jan 2007. The New York Times described the newly constructed building: \\"a vast mass of white marble (is) this imposing structure, and in the dazzling sunshine of a New-England Summer noon sparkles like a fairy palace of frost work.\\" The site of the Capitol was chosen since it is adjacent to Bushnell Park and had access to more surrounding open space than the older building in the immediate downtown. The site was originally the location of the old Trinity College and was then known as \\"Trinity Hill\\", and the city street to the immediate east is still named Trinity Street. (Trinity College relocated to a new campus south of the downtown.) Some galleries on the building's main floor hold historical artifacts, principally battle standards of Civil War units. The flags were deposited with the state by 10,000 of the state's veterans, who formed a procession to the Capitol, and deposited 30 regimental flags on September 17, 1879. This action was taken to make the building a memorial to the Civil War. The building suffered some crowding of offices, and the introduction of partition walls and other temporary expedients which detracted from the plan of the building up to 1979 and 1989 when efforts began at restoration. The State Capitol was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1971. and Architecture The building is one of the largest Eastlake style buildings. The exterior is of marble from East Canaan, Connecticut and granite from Westerly, Rhode Island. The building is roughly rectangular, the interior spaces organized around two open interior courts that run vertically to large skylights. In the center is a third circular open rotunda beneath the dome. The larger hall of the House of Representatives forms an extension on the south side. Interior of building Rotunda Aerial view of the Connecticut State Capitol The building's ornately decorated facades display statuary and include several statues, medallions and carved tympana over the doors (except the west, which only has statues). The statues are of politicians and other people important to the state's history, such as: the Reverend Thomas Hooker (1586‚Äì1647), Major John Mason (1600‚Äì1672), Governor John Winthrop, Jr. (1605/1606‚Äì1676), Roger Sherman (1721‚Äì1793), Revolutionary War Governor Jonathan Trumbull (1710‚Äì1785), Noah Webster (1758‚Äì1843), General Joseph Hawley (1826‚Äì1905), Civil War Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles (1802‚Äì1878), and United States Senator Orville Hitchcock Platt (1827‚Äì1905). There are 24 niches for sculpture, eight of which are still empty. The last one added was that of Ella T. Grasso (b. 1919), the first female governor of the state, who died in 1981 of cancer shortly after resigning her office. There are high relief scenes from the state's history in the 16 tympana above the doors, except for the carving above the main north door, which is of the state seal. The typanum of the main east door holds The Charter Oak by Charles Salewski, the first piece of sculpture created for the Capitol. The interior floors used white marble and red slate from Connecticut, and some of the colored marble is from Italy. The statues, medallions, and tympana are grouped by period. The north facade has six statues, five tympana, and two medallions, and the carvings are of pre-Revolutionary War figures. The east and west facades contain people from the Revolutionary War or government service, and the south facade's figures are from the Civil War and onwards. The central domed tower is distinctive. The dome itself is tall; on top of that is a cupola in height, and the drum below is , making the drum taller than the height of the main walls. The overall height of the tower is . The building's dome originally had a large statue on top, named The Genius of Connecticut, which was taken down in 1938 after being damaged in the great hurricane of that year. The statue was cast in bronze from a plaster original, and was tall, and weighed . It was executed in Rome and was cast in Munich, Germany. During World War II, the piece was donated to the federal government and melted down as part of the war effort to make ammunition and machine parts. The original plaster statue is now at the capitol, and has been coated in bronze. In 2002, Proposed Bill No. 5273 before the General Assembly sought authorization to make a new casting of the statue to restore the design for the capitol dome. The project finally passed in 2009, and a new bronze cast has been made. It has not yet been mounted on the summit of the dome, awaiting an additional $200,000 in funding. At the exterior base of the dome are 12 statues in six pairs representing Agriculture, Commerce, Education/Law, Force/War, Science/Justice, and Music. The interior has two matching ornate open stairwells and all of the building interior is painted in a multi-colored scheme continuing the 1870s Eastlake design aesthetic throughout. The Capitol Building is open to the public, with self-guided and guided tours available on weekdays. Guided tours begin inside the West Entrance of the Legislative Office Building.

For decades a dance hall and illegal casino, the Balinese Room was remodeled and reopened in 2001 without the gambling. Operated by Sicilian immigrant barbers-turned-bootleggers Sam and Rosario Maceo, the Balinese Room was an elite spot in the 1940s and 1950s (Galveston's open era), featuring entertainment by Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, George Burns, The Marx Brothers and other top acts of the day. Patrons of the private club included Howard Hughes, Sophie Tucker and wealthy oil barons from nearby Houston.\\"Stars of Yesteryear\\". Balinese Room In 1997, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During the early morning hours of September 13, 2008, the structure was completely destroyed by Hurricane Ike. The Balinese is featured in pop culture; Rock group ZZ Top wrote and performed a song about the club called, \\"Balinese.\\" History The Maceos took over \\"Chop Suey,\\" a small restaurant at the intersection of 21st Street and Seawall Boulevard, and in 1929 they opened \\"Maceo's Grotto\\" at that location.The Galveston Daily News. Page 51. November 6, 1983. It was one of many entertainment venues that popped up along the Galveston Seawall around that time (along with bathhouses and dance clubs, some of which were illegal casinos). In 1932, the \\"Grotto\\" was remodeled into a Chinese restaurant called \\"Sui Jen\\" (pronounced Swee Rin), and a 200-foot pier stretching out over the Gulf was added to the building. The pier location, across 21st Street from the Galvez, made the restaurant/club an easy walk for those Galveston visitors who preferred to stay in one of the city's most exclusive hotels. The Oriental- sounding name was changed to the more exotic sounding Balinese Room in 1942, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the decor was modified accordingly. The pier was also expanded to 600 feet. The Balinese Room's private back room was equipped with the most modern gaming (gambling) equipment, and the Maceos' advertisements invited high rollers to \\"Come Down and Play on Galveston Island.\\"Nurick, Albert \\"The Return of the Balinese Room\\" Balinese Room. . During this period it also became Balinese Room lore that head bartender Santos Cruz ‚Äúinvented‚Äù the Margarita for singer Peggy Lee in 1948. He supposedly named it after the Spanish version of her name, Margarita, and it's been a hit ever since.Rosenberg Library Museum \\"Lost Treasure: The Balinese Room\\" Balinese Room. . However, there is an account from 1936 of Iowa newspaper editor James Graham finding such a cocktail in Tijuana, years before any of the other margarita \\"creation myths\\". The club's illegal gambling made it a hub of mob activity. It was well known that the casino, at the far end of the pier, was operating in violation of the law. But the Maceos had many allies in the local government and on the police force, so charges were never filed. The sheriff of Galveston County at the time, when called before the Texas Legislature to testify about why the club remained open, replied that he wasn't a member of the private club so he couldn't get in. In 1956, Will Wilson was elected as Texas Attorney General after campaigning to \\"close down Galveston\\" and its illegal casinos using the Texas Rangers. The Rangers set up shop in a hotel near the club, and raided the casino often. But their efforts were thwarted by the length of the pier, known as the \\"Rangers Run\\". By the time they ran down to the tail end of the long, narrow club, tables, cards and chips had disappeared into secret wall and floor pockets. The band often would strike up the song \\"The Eyes of Texas\\" upon their arrival. The Balinese Room as it existed after reopening in 2001 At first the Rangers attempted to disrupt the business without heavy-handed tactics ‚Äì they simply sat in the casino all day, every day. Customers, intimidated by the Rangers' presence, were less frequent and business suffered.Nieman, Robert, \\"The Casino Wars and Ranger Johnny Klevenhagen \\". Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum. Retrieved July 26, 2005. The club nevertheless stayed open. The Rangers finally launched an undercover operation. Ranger Clint Peoples managed to pose as a customer and was admitted to the club and witnessed the gambling. His work coordinated with a raid enabled the gambling equipment in the club to be seized. The club finally closed its doors on May 30, 1957. In 1961, Hurricane Carla damaged the structure. Many of the piers that supported the structure had been washed away, and over following years, the building continued to decay. In the 1970s the Balinese Room was purchased and reopened by oil tycoon Johnny Mitchell, who turned the casino into a dinner club and disco. Many celebrities appeared at the Club during these years. After Mitchell passed in 1996, the Balinese Room and its pier eventually became the property of the State of Texas. A local attorney, Scott Arnold, took out a 60-year lease on the pier, and in 2001, reopened the Balinese Room for business. In addition to the Balinese Room itself, which was used for live music, parties, and weekend public dining, the pier had a salon, retail shops and a massage therapy room with a glass floor. Much of the original Balinese structure and decor had been either modified or destroyed over the years, but the South Seas interior decor of the large ballroom survived and was restored to match its 1940s appearance. The hallway of the long pier was lined with autographed photos of past performers and other memorabilia. Balinese Room on September 12, 2008, shortly before its destruction =Destruction= As Hurricane Ike approached Galveston on Friday, September 12, 2008, the storm surge raised the water level to a point where waves were occasionally topping the Galveston Seawall, sending water and debris onto Seawall Boulevard. Site of the Balinese Room in October 2008 Later that night and early Saturday morning, Hurricane Ike barreled ashore, with the eye of the storm tracking into Galveston Bay. Although the pier was higher than the seawall, Ike's storm surge, waves, and wind were more than the seventy-nine-year-old structure could handle. After having survived hurricanes Carla, Alicia, and numerous smaller storms, the famous old club was completely destroyed. Only plywood, rubble, metal and the famed red door were left after the hurricane passed through. =In popular culture= The Balinese Room is celebrated in a 1975 song by the band ZZ Top. The 1989 film Night Game featured the Balinese Room as a filming location. The 1993 film Dazed and Confused played an excerpt of the aforementioned ZZ Top song \\"Balinese\\".

Aijaz Ahmad (born 1932) is a Marxist philosopher, literary theorist and political commentator. He is currently the Chancellor's Professor at the UC Irvine School of Humanities‚Äô Department of Comparative Literature. Life Born in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, Aijaz Ahmad and his parents migrated to Pakistan following partition. After his education he worked in various universities in US and Canada. Before joining UC Irvine in 2017, he was professorial fellow at the Centre of Contemporary Studies, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi and was visiting professor of political science at York University, Toronto. He also works as an editorial consultant with the Indian newsmagazine Frontline and as a senior news analyst for the Indian website Newsclick. Work In his book In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures, Ahmad primarily discusses the role of theory and theorists in the movement against colonialism and imperialism. Ahmad's argument against those who uphold poststructuralism and postmodernist conceptions of material history revolves around the fact that very little has been accomplished since the advent of this brand of postcolonial inquiry. The book contains an especially polemical critique of Frederic Jameson's argument in \\"Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism\\" where Ahmad attacks Jameson on the grounds that Jameson's argument is insufficiently theorized in its use of terms like \\"Third World\\" which appears to be defined purely in terms of its experience of colonialism. This in turn leads Jameson to make hasty and untenable generalizations about how all \\"third world literature\\" would necessarily function as a national allegory that according to Jameson works as resistance to a system of global postmodernism. Ahmad in his book expresses his chagrin at how his critique of Jameson has been appropriated by Postcolonial scholars as an attack on Marxism, while Ahmad contends that he takes issue with Jameson simply because his use of Marxism in the essay on Third World Literature is not rigorous enough. The book also contains a lengthy critique of Edward Said's Orientalism which Ahmad argues reproduces the very liberal humanist tradition that it seeks to undermine in its selection of Western canonized texts that are critiqued for their Orientalism, as this upholds the idea that Western culture is represented in its entirety through those very texts. Furthermore, Ahmad asserts that by tracing Orientalist thought all the way back to Ancient Greece it becomes unclear in Said's work whether Orientalism is a product of Colonialism, or whether Colonialism is, in fact, a product of Orientalism.

Following her mother's remarriage to Edward Bethel, she was known as Dawn Shirley Bethel. She began dancing in USO shows during World War II at age ten. In 1948 she married Fred Bessire. She bore her first child at age 17 in 1949, and continued dancing in clubs under the stage name Shirley Mae Bessire. Career =Beginnings= North made her film d√©but as an uncredited extra in Excuse My Dust (1951). She was then spotted by a choreographer performing at the Macayo Club in Santa Monica, and was cast as a chorus girl in the film Here Come the Girls (1953), starring Bob Hope. Around that time, she adopted the stage name Sheree North. She made her Broadway d√©but in the musical Hazel Flagg, for which she won a Theatre World Award. She reprised her role in the film version, Living It Up (1954), starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. In early 1954, at age 22, she appeared in a live TV version of Cole Porter's Anything Goes on The Colgate Comedy Hour, with Ethel Merman, Frank Sinatra and Bert Lahr. =20th Century-Fox= In 1954, North signed a four-year contract with 20th Century-Fox. The studio had big plans for her, hoping to groom her as a replacement for the studio's leading‚Äîand increasingly uncontrollable‚Äîfemale star Marilyn Monroe. Fox tested North for leading roles in two of their upcoming productions, The Girl in Pink Tights and There's No Business Like Show Business‚Äîtwo films that had been offered to Monroe‚Äîwhile North was wearing Monroe's own studio wardrobe. However, after her screen tests, North was not cast in either film. In March 1954, North had a brush with scandal when it was revealed that she had once danced in a bikini in an 8 mm erotic film. Fox capitalized on the publicity, as the studio previously had with Monroe's nude calendar posing in 1952. In 1955 she was assigned the lead role opposite Betty Grable in How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955), a role that Marilyn Monroe had refused to accept. Media attention surrounding Monroe's suspension and North's hiring resulted in North appearing on the cover of Life magazine with the cover line \\"Sheree North Takes Over from Marilyn Monroe.\\"Sheree North at Variety.com How to Be Very, Very Popular would eventually not live up to the hype Fox had generated, even though North had appeared on What's My Line? to publicize the film and had been asked point-blank by one of the panelists if she has been associated with Monroe. The movie received mixed reviews from critics and was a moderate box office success. Despite this, film historians, then and now, cite North's electrically-charged dancing to \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\" as the film's most memorable scene. Sheree North on the cover of Life magazine (March 21, 1955) In an attempt to promote North, Fox studio executives lobbied to cast her in films surrounded with popular stars. The studio had campaigned to cast her in a film with comedian Tom Ewell, hoping to repeat the success he'd had with Monroe in The Seven Year Itch (1955). Soon thereafter, the studio assigned North and Ewell to appear together in the romantic comedy The Lieutenant Wore Skirts, plotting the story of an army lieutenant whose husband tries to get her discharged. To promote the film, North posed for several publicity shots showing her legs. When the majority of the shots were released, only her legs appeared, with the tagline \\"Believe it or not, these legs belong to an army lieutenant.\\" The film premiered with much fanfare in January 1956, and became a box-office success, grossing over $4 million in the United States. North's follow-up was The Best Things in Life Are Free (1956), a lavish musical in which her singing voice was dubbed by Eileen Wilson. She received fourth billing under Gordon MacRae, Dan Dailey, and Ernest Borgnine. It was an attempt by the studio to broaden North's audience appeal, and while it earned favorable reviews from critics, it did not become the success Fox had hoped for. In 1956 Fox signed another blonde bombshell in the person of Broadway actress Jayne Mansfield to a contract, and began promoting her instead of North. Although Fox gradually lost interest in North, the studio continued to offer her a string of films. She was offered the lead role in a film called The Girl Upstairs, in which she would have parodied Monroe's on-screen persona. When North's agent suggested she decline the film, Fox put her on suspension for two months. When her suspension was lifted one month later, North agreed to appear in The Way to the Gold, but only on the assurance that Elvis Presley would be her co-star. When Presley withdrew due to salary disagreements, he was replaced with Jeffrey Hunter, with whom North often quarreled. In the film, North attempted to progress from her blonde bombshell image, playing a sarcastic waitress, and while the film drew mixed reviews, it was a box office success. She next starred in No Down Payment (1957), a melodrama about the lives of multiple families living in a California subdivision. Tony Randall played her alcoholic husband in the film. Although critically acclaimed, it was not a box office success. The following year, she appeared in her final two films for Fox. In Love and War (1958) was a war drama film pairing her again with Jeffrey Hunter, and also with Robert Wagner, Dana Wynter, and Hope Lange. It was not a critical or financial success. Although the musical film genre had declined in profitability, she next co- starred in Mardi Gras (1958) with Pat Boone and Tommy Sands. It was her final film under her contract. =Later years= After North's contract with Fox ended in 1958, her career stalled, although she continued to act in films, television, and on the stage throughout the rest of her life. She guest- starred on episodes of The Untouchables and Gunsmoke (both 1963). North joined the cast of I Can Get It for You Wholesale in 1962, which featured Elliott Gould and introduced Barbra Streisand. She later guest-starred on a series of popular television series, including Ben Casey, Burke's Law (1963‚Äì65), The Virginian (1964‚Äì66), The Big Valley, The Iron Horse (both 1966), and The Fugitive (1965‚Äì67). After an eight-year absence from film acting, North accepted a lead role in the B-movie science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966). The film opened to only a minor release in 1966 and has rarely been seen since. North co-starred with Elvis Presley in one of his final films, The Trouble with Girls (1969). While not working in film, she worked in musical theater and many theatrical productions during her 40-year career. In 1965 she took over for Shirley Knight in a Los Angeles production of \\"Dutchman,\\" which coincided with the 1965 Watts riots. The production was controversial and was blamed by conservatives for inciting unrest. It was picketed, ads were blocked from the newspapers, and North's car was set on fire. Despite that, the production ran for a year. She had appeared on Broadway doing a lively routine in the musical Hazel Flagg (1953), consequently winning a Theatre World Award. This led directly to her being cast for the film, Living It Up (1954). In 1962, North appeared on Broadway as \\"Martha Mills\\" in I Can Get It for You Wholesale, with Jack Kruschen, Elliot Gould, and a young Barbra Streisand in her Broadway debut. North also appeared in productions of Irma La Douce, Bye Bye Birdie, and Can Can. From the 1960s onward, North focused mainly on becoming a solid and versatile character actress, appearing on almost every television western, cop show, and medical drama produced from the 1960s through the 1990s. She displayed a fine talent for comic timing on many of the situation comedies of the era. She was a favorite in several made-for-television movies. She also earned Emmy nominations for appearances on \\"Marcus Welby, M.D.\\" (1969) and \\"Archie Bunker's Place\\" (1979). Ed Asner as Lou Grant and Sheree North as Charlene Maguire, his new girlfriend, in a fifth-season episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. A favorite of film producer/director Don Siegel, she appeared in four of his films: Madigan (1968) opposite Richard Widmark; in Charley Varrick (1973) with Walter Matthau, as John Wayne's long-lost love in the actor's final film; in The Shootist (1976); and in Telefon (1977). She had supporting roles in two Charles Bronson movies, Breakout (1975) with Robert Duvall, and the aforementioned Telefon. Other notable Sheree North performances are 1969's The Gypsy Moths with Burt Lancaster and Gene Hackman; as Burt Lancaster's ex-lover in director Michael Winner's 1971 western, Lawman with Robert Ryan, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Duvall, and Albert Salmi. She appeared in the 1971 crime drama The Organization with Sidney Poitier, and appeared in 1973's The Outfit with Duvall, Joe Don Baker, and Karen Black. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, North appeared in guest spots on Hawaii Five-O, The Streets of San Francisco, McMillan & Wife, Matlock, Family, and Magnum, P.I.. She played Lou Grant's girlfriend on several episodes of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She co-starred with Sheldon Leonard in the short-lived CBS sitcom Big Eddie in 1975. During the 1980‚Äì81 season, North starred in I'm a Big Girl Now with Diana Canova, Danny Thomas, and Martin Short. The series aired 19 episodes.I'm a Big Girl Now profile, imdb.com; accessed December 26, 2014. In 1980, she played Marilyn Monroe's mother in the made-for-television film Marilyn: The Untold Story. In 1983, she appeared in the ensemble cast of the Steven Bochco series Bay City Blues. The hour-long drama series aired eight episodes.Bay City Blues profile, imdb.com; accessed December 26, 2014. North later appeared in two episodes of The Golden Girls as Blanche Devereaux's sister Virginia. In the 1990s, she appeared as Cosmo Kramer's mother Babs Kramer in two episodes of the sitcom Seinfeld. North's last onscreen role came in John Landis' black comedy Susan's Plan (1998). Personal life North was married four times and had two children. In 1948, at age 16, she married Fred Bessire, a draftsman, with whom she had a daughter, Dawn (born 1949). The marriage ended in 1953. In 1955, she married television writer Bud Freeman, and the marriage ended a year later. Her third marriage was to psychologist Gerhardt Sommer, with whom she had another daughter, Erica Eve. The marriage ended in divorce in 1963.Sheree North profile, Filmreference.com; accessed December 26, 2014. At the time of her death, North was married to her fourth husband, Emmy Award-winning Title Designer, Phillip \\"Phill\\" Norman. On November 4, 2005, North died during cancer surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 73 years old.

He and his family lived and presumably still live along Arkansas' National Scenic 7 Byway between Harrison and Jasper, and have had a major impact on the history of that area. In the early twentieth century Raney purchased a piece of land in an area previously known as \\"Wilcockson\\". They diverted water from a nearby creek, called Mill Creek, to create a waterfall and a pond. They renamed the area Marble Falls, the name it has today. They then turned the pond into a trout farm. In 1949, Raney purchased \\"Wild Horse Cavern\\", a cave that had been a tourist attraction since 1928, but had been closed and virtually abandoned for ten years. He revitalized it by cleaning out debris left by vandals, and adding safety features such as stairs, hand rails, and an electric lighting system. In 1950, he reopened the cave as Mystic Caverns, and began giving tours. Albert Raney Sr. turned the cave property over to his son, Albert Raney Jr. in 1959. Albert Jr. and friends and family would continue giving guided tours of the cave until it was sold to the developers of Dogpatch USA in 1966 along with the family trout farm. However, the Raney's would continue to manage the trout farm and Mystic Caverns for Dogpatch. In 1981, Mystic Caverns was sold to an unknown party, but was still managed by Bruce Raney, son of Albert Jr. In 1993 Dogpatch USA was closed, and the trout farm died with it. Mystic Caverns, however, is still in operation however but is now owned by Steve Rush and is in no way affiliated with the Raney family.

Four buildings were used for this purpose, none of which exist today, making Ontario one of four provinces not to have an official vice-regal residence.The others are Alberta, Saskatchewan and Quebec, although Saskatchewan's Government House does contain the Lieutenant-Governor's offices and is used for official entertaining. Early accommodations The colony's first Lieutenant Governor, John Graves Simcoe, occupied a couple of residences during his tenure. Upon his arrival in Upper Canada in 1792, he used one of the buildings at Navy Hall in Niagara-on- the-Lake as a residence, sharing the space with Upper Canada‚Äôs legislature. When Simcoe moved the colonial capital to York (present-day Toronto) in 1793, he built a summer residence, Castle Frank, north of the settlement in 1794. Simcoe's successor and the colony's second Lieutenant Governor, Peter Hunter, initially continued to reside in his own home, Russell Abbey, located at the south-west corner of Princess and Front streets. First Government House The first official government house was a one-storey, U-shaped frame house built at Fort York in 1800, designed by Captain Robert Pilkington and first occupied by Hunter.http://www.fortyork.ca/29-gallery/103-gallery-17931815.html#!1800_Fort_York_Government_House The structure was destroyed when a nearby powder magazine exploded in 1813 during the War of 1812.Arthur, Eric.

Second Government House (Elmsley House) Elmsley House in 1854 Elmsley Villa, c. 1840 After the destruction of the Fort York house, York did not have another Government House until after the War of 1812. In 1815, the government purchased Elmsley House, a more commodious Georgian residence, for its Lieutenant Governor. The new Government House was located in a wooded area to the west of the settled portion of the (then) Town of York, roughly midway on the block now occupied by Roy Thomson Hall and Metro Hall in downtown Toronto. Built in 1798, the residence had been the home of the Chief Justice and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, John Elmsley, and it served as the colony's Government House from 1815 to 1841 (and intermittently from 1841 to 1858, during some of the times when Toronto served as the capital of the Province of Canada). From 1847 to 1849 it was home to the Toronto Normal School. For many years after its purchase by the government, the residence was still known by the name of its former owner, with the correspondence of the Lieutenant Governor typically dated from \\"Elmsley House\\".The History of These Graves .

Elmsley Villa was a two-storey Georgian structure that stood until at least the 1860s. Elmsley House was destroyed by fire in 1862.Roy Thomson Hall. Lost Rivers. Retrieved 27 February 2009. Third Government House The third Government House in 1908. Four years after the fire at Elmsley House, the firm of Gundry and Langley of Toronto was commissioned to design a new Government House on the same site. In 1868, construction began on a new Government House, designed in the Second Empire style by architect Henry Langley. A three-storey red brick home, trimmed with Ohio cut stone, the building featured a tower, steeply sloped mansard roofs and dormer windows, with the main entrance and carriage porch facing Simcoe Street. The drawing room on the first floor and the state bedroom on the second floor faced Lake Ontario over a large landscaped garden. Completed in 1870, the house cost , and its first resident was John Beverley Robinson. By the 20th century, the development of railways and industrial uses nearby prompted the provincial government to seek a more appropriate location for its vice-regal residence, as it had done more than a century before. The third Government House was sold to the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1912 and demolished in 1915. Pendarves (Cumberland House) Pendarves at 33 St. George Street, c. 1911 During the transition from the third to the fourth Government House, the Lieutenant Governor temporarily lived at Pendarves (later known as Cumberland House) from 1912 to 1915. Originally designed as an Italianate villa by Frederick William Cumberland for his family's use and completed in 1860, the house is located at 33 St. George Street.Pendarves ‚Äì Cumberland House It has been owned since 1923 by the University of Toronto and now functions as the international students' centre.Centre for International Experience Fourth Government House (Chorley Park) The government sought to construct a new Government House on Bloor Street East, and twelve architects submitted proposals in 1909. However, as that area was becoming too commercial, the Province moved the site to a 0.06 km¬≤ (14 acre) parcel of secluded and undeveloped land in Toronto's Rosedale neighbourhood. The proceeds from the sale of the Bloor Street site were used to acquire the land in Rosedale.Chorley Park. Lost Rivers. Retrieved 27 February 2009. Chorley Park, the fourth Government House, was constructed between 1911 and 1915. It was named for Chorley, Lancashire, the birthplace of Toronto alderman and first chair of Toronto Public Library John Hallam (1833-1900). The house was designed by architect Francis R. Heakes and built of Credit Valley stone in a French Renaissance style, reminiscent of French ch√¢teaux in the Loire Valley. It was one of the most expensive residences ever constructed in Canada at the time, and outshone even Rideau Hall in size and grandeur. Sir John Strathearn Hendrie and his wife were the first vice-regal couple to live at Chorley Park. The Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VIII) stayed here for three days in late August, 1919 on his cross Canada tour. Ontario's fourth Government House, Chorley Park, as seen from the air circa 1930 During the Great Depression, Mitchell Hepburn made it a key component of his party's election platform to close Chorley Park, promising that an opulent palace would not be maintained by the taxpayers of Ontario; Chorley Park used 965 tons of coal to operate, whereas the average Toronto home used only six to seven.Maloney, Mark; Toronto Star: The Curious Case of Chorley Park; July 30, 2007 After Hepburn was appointed Premier, following the Liberal Party's victory in the 1937 provincial election, he ensured that Albert Edward Matthews would be the last Ontario Lieutenant Governor to live in an official residence; in 1937, after only 22 years and seven viceroys, Chorley Park was closed. The contents of the house were auctioned off in 1938, bringing in a profit of $18,000, and Ontario became the first province in Canada not to have a Government House. (Alberta also closed its government house in 1938.) The estate was bought by the federal government and served various functions including as a military hospital during World War II, the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Toronto, and residence for refugees of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, including several of Imre Nagy's staff members. Under mayor Nathan Phillips in 1960, the City of Toronto bought the house for $100,000 in order to destroy it and create municipal parkland. At the time, Chorley Park was considered dilapidated and outmoded, and municipal funds were being spent demolishing heritage structures throughout Toronto to make room for modern buildings. The building was demolished in 1961, and the grounds of the estate were added to the civic parks system. Chorley Park today The only trace of Government House left is the bridge to the forecourt, and some depressions in the earth that outline the rough footprint of its foundations. The once formal gardens have long gone fallow and today Chorley Park is a 'naturalized' park. Current facilities Ontario's Lieutenant Governor uses an office and suite of rooms for entertainment in the Ontario Legislative Building, and lives in his or her private Toronto home or is provided a rented residence by the provincial government. Since the closure of the last Government House, whenever the Sovereign is visiting Toronto they reside in the Royal Suite at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel.

Most notably a musician, her work is known among electronica, nu jazz and trip hop circles for her trademark spoken word and aspirated singing style as well as its erotic and literary subtexts. Daou's songs are represented by Downtown Music Publishing. Formative years Daou was born and spent her early childhood in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, relocating in 1984 to attend boarding school in Massachusetts. As a young adult, she attended Vassar College for two years and spent several years in New York City's Hell's Kitchen area before earning a scholarship to study dance at Columbia University. There, she would train with choreographer Eric Hawkins and explore visual art with Barry Moser and poetry with Kenneth Koch, whom she cites as having sparked her interest in spoken word. Daou ultimately graduated cum laude with a visual arts and art history degree from Barnard College/Columbia and frequently appeared in her senior year at Postcrypt Coffeehouse, the university's on-campus poetry lounge. Early recordings While still a student, Daou began her career recording for NuGroove Records, one of New York's underground electronica labels. Demos that Daou had recorded caught the attention of two NuGroove DJs, and they invited her to provide guest vocals on a developing track. The experiment led to the label's top- selling single \\"It Could Not Happen,\\" which later was released on Network Records in the United Kingdom. Daou also performed as \\"Vandal\\" at Los Angeles' Stranger Than Fiction rave at the Shrine Auditorium in 1990. =Head Music= Daou's underground success brought her to the attention of Columbia Records, which signed her to a seven-album record deal. Daou, along with a five-piece band released Head Music as The Daou in 1992. An airy fusion of rock, jazz and funk, Head Music enjoyed moderate success and received praiseworthy reviews in the New York Times Sunday Arts & Leisure section and CREAM and Billboard magazines. The album's first single \\"Surrender Yourself\\" was remixed by Danny Tenaglia and reached No. 1 on Billboard's Dance Chart. Creative disagreements with Columbia would see Daou negotiate out of her contract and subsequently release Head Music's next two singles for the independent Tribal Records. MCA years =Zipless= In 1994 Daou, now billed as a solo act, recorded Zipless, a sexually charged collection of pieces inspired by the work of the poet/novelist Erica Jong. A slight stylistic evolution from Head Music, Zipless employed a somewhat more synthesized sound and introduced Daou's foray into recorded spoken word. Daou released Zipless on her own label, Lotus Records. The album quickly established a cult following and attracted the attention of Bob Krasnow, the music A&R; executive whose artist signings include Anita Baker, Bj√∂rk, Natalie Merchant and Metallica. Krasnow signed Daou to his fledgling MCA Records subsidiary Krasnow Entertainment and re- released Zipless in 1995. Zipless garnered favorable international press, with features and reviews in Time, Billboard Spotlight Review, Bikini, Vibe, Wire, Mix Mag, URB, the Toronto Star and Le Monde, among other publications. The first single, \\"Near the Black Forest,\\" was featured in heavy rotation on VH1 and, along with follow-up single \\"Sunday Afternoons,\\" enjoyed moderate radio rotation. Daou toured nationally with New York rapper Guru and his hip hop- jazz fusion project Jazzmatazz, playing at venues such as L.A.'s House of Blues and Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco. =Slow to Burn= In 1995 MCA underwent significant management changes, at which time the company faltered on the momentum that had been building for several months around Zipless. Daou recorded a sophomore solo album, Slow to Burn, and released it in the Fall of that year. With each song a vignette inspired by the biographies of such celebrated female artisans as Billie Holiday, Gertrude Stein and Frida Kahlo, Slow To Burn enjoyed moderate to heavy smooth jazz format radio play with its first single \\"Two to Tango.\\" It was featured in reviews in VIBE, URB, Billboard, Curve, and Cover magazines. Two to Tango was remixed by Danny Tenaglia and reached the top of Billboard's Dance Chart, remaining at No. 1 for three weeks. It was featured in the Matthew Perry film Fools Rush In. Two other songs from the album,\\"If I Could (What I Would Do For You)\\" and \\"How Do You Feel?,\\" were featured in the films An American Werewolf in Paris and Idle Hands, respectively. In the winter of 1996 Seagram took over MCA and Doug Morris, a reputed adversary of Bob Krasnow, became president of the record label. Krasnow soon retired and folded his namesake label. Daou chose to leave as well, and negotiated out of her contract with MCA. A return to the indie world =Plutonium Glow= Over the next couple years Daou again chose to release her records independently. With some support from Benny Medina/Handprint Entertainment, she released 1997's dancy, cosmic exploration- themed Plutonium Glow, on her own DaouMusic label. The project was one of the earliest albums by a former major-label artist to be marketed and sold on the internet. The online release was followed by a 1998 UK re-release by independent international distributor Oxygen Music Works. This latter version featured an alternate song sequencing and a new track, \\"Alive,\\" in place of \\"Visions of You.\\" Artwork from the Plutonium Glow era was showcased in an exhibit called \\"Plutonium Show\\" at Untitled (SPACE) Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. A piece from the show entitled \\"Music Box\\" subsequently went on for display at a National Arts Club student exhibition, securing the Jeffrey Seyfert Memorial Prize. =Dear John Coltrane= In 1999, Daou released Dear John Coltrane on the Oxygen imprint. Somewhat more heady and nostalgic in the vein of Slow to Burn than danceable like Plutonium Glow, the homage to the legendary jazz saxophonist met with warm reception by fans, but sparse marketing, press, club and radio support. =Make You Love= Daou's next album Make You Love, inspired by the travails of a girlfriend living in Paris, was co-released in 2000 on Daou's own label imprint and EMI in France. Generally positive reviews for Make You Love were featured in Le Monde, Elle, Magic, and Billboard Spotlight Review, and many critics received the album as Daou's most pop-oriented. The album's song \\"Julliette\\" was used in a scene for U.S. television series Dawson's Creek; the single \\"A Little Bit of Pain\\" was used in Lifetime TV movie Sex, Lies and Obsession; and in the fall of 2000 Daou promoted the project as guest on a seven-week concert tour of France by pop vocalist Etienne Daho. The song \\"Make Believe\\" from Plutonium Glow was re- recorded as a duet with Daho for his Corps et armes album. Hiatus and return On the heels of Make You Love, Daou would take a seven-year hiatus from releasing new material. Her catalog was tapped for various music compilations and for the soundtrack to 2005 French film Lila Says, but Daou would devote this time largely to visual arts, writing and academic pursuits. =Joe Sent Me= In 2007, Daou announced on her official website that various pieces created since Make You Love were being compiled for an upcoming multimedia release, introduced under the working title Then, at Midnight. The project, ostensibly a new music album with related graphical content, ultimately would undergo a name change to Joe Sent Me, a passphrase used to navigate freely among the clandestine U.S. Prohibition-era speakeasy subculture. Several pivotal moments during Daou's hiatus would shape her new output‚Äîthe September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York, where she then resided; and inspiring travel experiences among them. On May 19, 2008, audio clips, lyrics and interactive graphic content heralding Joe Sent Me premiered on the website for the Barcelona Poetry Symposium. The material thereafter became available on Daou's own site, and the album itself was released in November 2008 via Daou's online marketplace. In May 2009, a program of original dances based on the music of Joe Sent Me debuted at Mercer County Community College's Kelsey Theatre, performed by the school's Mercer Dance Ensemble. =Love Among the Shadowed Things= On January 31, 2010, a collection of four tone poems from Daou, collectively titled Love Among the Shadowed Things, debuted on the seasonal Weird Tales for Winter segment of Jonny Mugwump & The Exotic Pylon, an experimental radio series broadcasting on London's community radio/Radio Art-format Resonance 104.4 FM. Composed around the themes \\"Dream,\\" \\"Snow,\\" \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Night,\\" the poems that comprise Love Among the Shadowed Things are stream-of-consciousness collages of spoken word, sparse free jazz accompaniment and thickly layered sound effects. Daou describes this aural meditation on a particular December night as a juxtapositioning of things \\"secular and temporal ... familiar ... mystifying ... universal and eternal.\\" =Light Sweet Crude (Act 1: Hybrid)= In summer 2012, Daou's official website announced the online streaming debut of song \\"Revolution.\\" The track would be included as a feature remix on Noozik ‚Äì Volume 1, a collaborative music release between New York fashion house Nooka and digital indie music label Synth Records. Daou's website also announced that the original version of \\"Revolution\\" would appear on an upcoming 2013 album: Light Sweet Crude. Employing an array of producers, Light Sweet Crude (Act I: Hybrid) on its release would bear arguably a broader and more pronounced influence of discrete musical styles‚Äîe.g. house music, reggae, hip hop, and symphonic‚Äîthan prior projects. Lyrically, too, Light Sweet Crude would see Daou expand into new territory: Where earlier work all but exclusively explored the tumult of personal angst and interpersonal liaisons, those matters in Light Sweet Crude become corollary to such geopolitical phenomena as revolution and war. > \\"I would say it has something to do with my own growing awareness and > perception that politics is no longer something that exists outside of > ourselves,\\" Daou has said. \\"There is no longer much, if any, separation > between what happens outside in the world and what happens inside > ourselves.\\" Discography =Albums= *Head Music (with The Daou) ‚Äì 1992 *Zipless ‚Äì 1994 *Slow to Burn ‚Äì 1996 *Plutonium Glow ‚Äì 1997/1998 (two releases) *Dear John Coltrane ‚Äì 1999 *Make You Love ‚Äì 2000 *Joe Sent Me ‚Äì 2008 *Sweet Light Crude (Act 1: Hybrid) ‚Äì 2013 *Welcome to My Blues: An Anthology (1994‚Äì2017) ‚Äì 2017 =Singles= *\\"Near The Black Forest\\" *\\"Sunday Afternoons\\" *\\"Two To Tango\\" *\\"How Do You Feel\\" *\\"A Little Bit Of Pain\\" *\\"Consequences\\" *\\"Heart Of Wax\\" *\\"Revolution\\" *\\"Danger Ahead\\" *\\"Trouble Comes\\" See also *Acid jazz *Fusion References External links * Official website * Interview of Vanessa Daou in french, november 2007 Category:1967 births Category:20th- century American singers Category:20th-century American women singers Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century American women singers Category:Acid jazz musicians Category:Ambient musicians Category:American dance musicians Category:American female pop singers Category:American pop singers Category:American female singer-songwriters Category:American house musicians Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American women in electronic music Category:Barnard College alumni Category:Chill-out musicians Category:Downtempo musicians Category:Electronica musicians Category:Feminist musicians Category:Living people Category:Nu jazz musicians Category:People from Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands Category:Trip hop musicians Category:United States Virgin Islands musicians Category:Vassar College alumni ","title":"Vanessa Daou"},{"id":"2181771","text":"The Harrison Tweed Award was created in 1956 to recognize the extraordinary achievements of state and local bar associations that develop or significantly expand projects or programs to increase access to civil legal services for poor persons or criminal defense services for indigents.

Guangzhou Free Man After a brief stint in Venezuela, Hodge was signed in the summer of 2010 by Guangzhou Free Man of China's National Basketball League. He scored 16 points in his debut against Shenyang. Petrochimi Bandar Imam Later in 2010, Hodge received a substantial offer from Petrochimi Bandar Imam BC of the Iranian Basketball Super League. Although impressed by the quality of basketball in Iran, Hodge was not comfortable with the environment. On March 3, 2011, Hodge and the club agreed to terminate his contract because they were unable to pay him the full amount. Tsmoki-Minsk Hodge's first new team of 2011 was BC Tsmoki-Minsk, a Belarusian Premier League team in Minsk. Due to a struggling economy, the club was slow to make payments and Hodge ultimately exercised an option to exit his contract early. Jiangsu Tongxi Hodge returned to China in 2011, this time playing for the Jiangsu Tongxi. In seven games with Jiangsu, he averaged 25.6 points per game and was named the All-Chinese NBL Import Player of the Year.

In Paris, he was teammates with Sean May and Jawad Williams, both of whom were Hodge's conference rivals in college and his teenage friends from the youth basketball circuit. Saint John Mill Rats The Saint John Mill Rats of the National Basketball League of Canada announced the signing of Hodge on February 4, 2013. Hodge became just the ninth former NBA player to ever play in the league. The club bought out his contract with Paris-Levallois Basket later that month on February 25. Post-playing career On May 18, 2015, Buffalo Bulls head coach Nate Oats announced that Hodge would serve as the Director of Player Development for the State University of New York at Buffalo. On March 29, 2016, Hodge joined his former college coach Herb Sendek as an assistant coach at Santa Clara University.Julius Hodge to join Herb Sendek as assistant coach for Santa Clara Broncos On April 26, 2018, Hodge joined the staff of Jean Prioleau at San Jose State as an assistant coach.  Personal  After visiting a nightclub on April 8, 2006, Hodge was on Interstate 76 in North Denver around 2:00 a.m. when another vehicle pulled alongside his and fired several shots. Hodge was told he came within 5 minutes of bleeding to death. The case has yet to be solved. In 2011, Hodge played for the Antigua and Barbuda national basketball team in the Caribbean Basketball Confederation Championship. During each offseason of his overseas playing career, Hodge returned to live in Raleigh, North Carolina where he played during his college career. As of 2013, Hodge is married with two children. He describes himself as a \\"movie buff.\\" His quote \\"When we hungry, we eat\\" after upsetting top ranked Duke, was the inspiration for the American Aquarium song \\"Wolves\\", and was the title track for the album.

MAX phase composite X-ray microtomography, like tomography and X-ray computed tomography, uses X-rays to create cross-sections of a physical object that can be used to recreate a virtual model (3D model) without destroying the original object. The prefix micro- (symbol: ¬µ) is used to indicate that the pixel sizes of the cross- sections are in the micrometre range. These pixel sizes have also resulted in the terms high-resolution X-ray tomography, micro‚Äìcomputed tomography (micro- CT or ¬µCT), and similar terms. Sometimes the terms high-resolution CT (HRCT) and micro-CT are differentiated, but in other cases the term high-resolution micro-CT is used. Virtually all tomography today is computed tomography. Micro-CT has applications both in medical imaging and in industrial computed tomography. In general, there are two types of scanner setups. In one setup, the X-ray source and detector are typically stationary during the scan while the sample/animal rotates. The second setup, much more like a clinical CT scanner, is gantry based where the animal/specimen is stationary in space while the X-ray tube and detector rotate around. These scanners are typically used for small animals (in vivo scanners), biomedical samples, foods, microfossils, and other studies for which minute detail is desired. The first X-ray microtomography system was conceived and built by Jim Elliott in the early 1980s. The first published X-ray microtomographic images were reconstructed slices of a small tropical snail, with pixel size about 50 micrometers. Working principle =Imaging system= Fan beam reconstruction The fan-beam system is based on a one-dimensional (1D) X-ray detector and an electronic X-ray source, creating 2D cross-sections of the object. Typically used in human computed tomography systems. Cone beam reconstruction The cone-beam system is based on a 2D X-ray detector (camera) and an electronic X-ray source, creating projection images that later will be used to reconstruct the image cross-sections. =Open/Closed systems= Open X-ray system In an open system, X-rays may escape or leak out, thus the operator must stay behind a shield, have special protective clothing, or operate the scanner from a distance or a different room. Typical examples of these scanners are the human versions, or designed for big objects. Closed X-ray system In a closed system, X-ray shielding is put around the scanner so the operator can put the scanner on a desk or special table. Although the scanner is shielded, care must be taken and the operator usually carries a dosimeter, since X-rays have a tendency to be absorbed by metal and then re-emitted like an antenna. Although a typical scanner will produce a relatively harmless volume of X-rays, repeated scannings in a short timeframe could pose a danger. Digital detectors with small pixel pitches and micro-focus x-ray tubes are usually employed to yield in high resolution images. Closed systems tend to become very heavy because lead is used to shield the X-rays. Therefore, the smaller scanners only have a small space for samples. 3D image reconstruction =The principle= Because microtomography scanners offer isotropic, or near isotropic, resolution, display of images does not need to be restricted to the conventional axial images. Instead, it is possible for a software program to build a volume by 'stacking' the individual slices one on top of the other. The program may then display the volume in an alternative manner. =Image reconstruction software= For X-ray microtomography, powerful open source software is available, such as the ASTRA toolbox. The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox of high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography, from 2009‚Äì2014 developed by iMinds-Vision Lab, University of Antwerp and since 2014 jointly developed by iMinds-VisionLab, UAntwerpen and CWI, Amsterdam. The toolbox supports parallel, fan, and cone beam, with highly flexible source/detector positioning. A large number of reconstruction algorithms are available, including FBP, ART, SIRT, SART, CGLS. =Volume rendering= Volume rendering is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set, as produced by a microtomography scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel. =Image segmentation= Where different structures have similar threshold density, it can become impossible to separate them simply by adjusting volume rendering parameters. The solution is called segmentation, a manual or automatic procedure that can remove the unwanted structures from the image.

(the condition of being divided into \\"two-chambers\\") is a controversial hypothesis in psychology and neuroscience which argues that the human mind once operated in a state in which cognitive functions were divided between one part of the brain which appears to be \\"speaking\\", and a second part which listens and obeys‚Äîa bicameral mind, and that the evolutionary breakdown of this division gave rise to consciousness in humans. The term was coined by Julian Jaynes, who presented the idea in his 1976 book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, wherein he made the case that a bicameral mentality was the normal and ubiquitous state of the human mind as recently as 3,000 years ago, near the end of the Mediterranean bronze age. The Origin of Consciousness Jaynes uses governmental bicameralism as a metaphor to describe a mental state in which the experiences and memories of the right hemisphere of the brain are transmitted to the left hemisphere via auditory hallucinations. The metaphor is based on the idea of lateralization of brain function although each half of a normal human brain is constantly communicating with the other through the corpus callosum. The metaphor is not meant to imply that the two halves of the bicameral brain were \\"cut off\\" from each other but that the bicameral mind was experienced as a different, non- conscious mental schema wherein volition in the face of novel stimuli was mediated through a linguistic control mechanism and experienced as auditory verbal hallucination. =Bicameral mentality= Bicameral mentality would be non-conscious in its inability to reason and articulate about mental contents through meta-reflection, reacting without explicitly realizing and without the meta-reflective ability to give an account of why one did so. The bicameral mind would thus lack metaconsciousness, autobiographical memory, and the capacity for executive \\"ego functions\\" such as deliberate mind-wandering and conscious introspection of mental content. When bicamerality as a method of social control was no longer adaptive in complex civilizations, this mental model was replaced by the conscious mode of thought which, Jaynes argued, is grounded in the acquisition of metaphorical language learned by exposure to narrative practice. According to Jaynes, ancient people in the bicameral state of mind would have experienced the world in a manner that has some similarities to that of a person with schizophrenia. Rather than making conscious evaluations in novel or unexpected situations, the person would hallucinate a voice or \\"god\\" giving admonitory advice or commands and obey without question: One would not be at all conscious of one's own thought processes per se. Jaynes's hypothesis is offered as a possible explanation of \\"command hallucinations\\" that often direct the behavior of those afflicted by first rank symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as other voice hearers. =Jaynes's evidence= Jaynes built a case for this hypothesis that human brains existed in a bicameral state until as recently as 3,000 years ago by citing evidence from many diverse sources including historical literature. He took an interdisciplinary approach, drawing data from many different fields. Jaynes asserted that, until roughly the times written about in Homer's Iliad, humans did not generally have the self-awareness characteristic of consciousness as most people experience it today. Rather, the bicameral individual was guided by mental commands believed to be issued by external \\"gods\\"‚Äîcommands which were recorded in ancient myths, legends and historical accounts. This is exemplified not only in the commands given to characters in ancient epics but also the very muses of Greek mythology which \\"sang\\" the poems. According to Jaynes, the ancients literally heard muses as the direct source of their music and poetry. Jaynes asserts that in the Iliad and sections of the Old Testament no mention is made of any kind of cognitive processes such as introspection, and there is no apparent indication that the writers were self-aware. Jaynes suggests, the older portions of the Old Testament (such as the Book of Amos) have few or none of the features of some later books of the Old Testament (such as Ecclesiastes) as well as later works such as Homer's Odyssey, which show indications of a profoundly different kind of mentality‚Äîan early form of consciousness. In ancient times, Jaynes noted, gods were generally much more numerous and much more anthropomorphic than in modern times, and speculates that this was because each bicameral person had their own \\"god\\" who reflected their own desires and experiences. He also noted that in ancient societies the corpses of the dead were often treated as though still alive (being seated, dressed, and even fed) as a form of ancestor worship, and Jaynes argued that the dead bodies were presumed to be still living and the source of auditory hallucinations. This adaptation to the village communities of 100 individuals or more formed the core of religion. Unlike today's hallucinations, the voices of ancient times were structured by cultural norms to produce a seamlessly functioning society. Jaynes inferred that these \\"voices\\" came from the right brain counterparts of the left brain language centres; specifically, the counterparts to Wernicke's area and Broca's area. These regions are somewhat dormant in the right brains of most modern humans, but Jaynes noted that some studies show that auditory hallucinations correspond to increased activity in these areas of the brain. Jaynes notes that even at the time of publication there is no consensus as to the cause or origins of schizophrenia. Jaynes argues that schizophrenia is a vestige of humanity's earlier bicameral state. Recent evidence shows that many schizophrenics do not just hear random voices but experience \\"command hallucinations\\" instructing their behavior or urging them to commit certain acts. As support for Jaynes's argument, these command hallucinations are little different from the commands from gods which feature prominently in ancient stories. Indirect evidence supporting Jaynes's theory that hallucinations once played an important role in human mentality can be found in the recent book Muses, Madmen, and Prophets: Rethinking the History, Science, and Meaning of Auditory Hallucination by Daniel Smith. =Breakdown of bicameralism= Jaynes theorized that a shift from bicameralism marked the beginning of introspection and consciousness as we know it today. According to Jaynes, this bicameral mentality began malfunctioning or \\"breaking down\\" during the 2nd millennium BCE. He speculates that primitive ancient societies tended to collapse periodically: for example, Egypt's Intermediate Periods, as well as the periodically vanishing cities of the Mayas, as changes in the environment strained the socio-cultural equilibria sustained by this bicameral mindset. The Bronze age collapse of the 2nd millennium BCE led to mass migrations and created a rash of unexpected situations and stresses which required ancient minds to become more flexible and creative. Self-awareness, or consciousness, was the culturally evolved solution to this problem. This necessity of communicating commonly observed phenomena among individuals who shared no common language or cultural upbringing encouraged those communities to become self-aware to survive in a new environment. Thus consciousness, like bicamerality, emerged as a neurological adaptation to social complexity in a changing world. Jaynes further argues that divination, prayer, and oracles arose during this breakdown period, in an attempt to summon instructions from the \\"gods\\" whose voices could no longer be heard. The consultation of special bicamerally operative individuals, or of divination by casting lots and so forth, was a response to this loss, a transitional era depicted, for example, in the book of 1 Samuel. It was also evidenced in children who could communicate with the gods, but as their neurology was set by language and society they gradually lost that ability. Those who continued prophesying, being bicameral according to Jaynes, could be killed. Leftovers of the bicameral mind today, according to Jaynes, include mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and the hallucinations present in patients with split brain syndrome. Reception =Popular reception= An early (1977) reviewer considered Jaynes's hypothesis worthy and offered conditional support, arguing the notion deserves further study. The Origin of Consciousness was financially successful, and has been reprinted several times. Originally published in 1976, it was nominated for the National Book Award in 1978. It has been translated into Italian, Spanish, German, French, and Persian. A new edition, with an afterword that addressed some criticisms and restated the main themes, was published in the United States in 1990 and in the United Kingdom (by Penguin Books) in 1993, re-issued in 2000. Philip K. Dick, Terrence McKenna, and David Bowie all cited the book as an influence. =Scholarly reactions= Jaynes's hypothesis remains controversial. The primary scientific criticism has been that the conclusions drawn by Jaynes had no basis in neuropsychiatric fact. According to Jaynes, language is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for consciousness: language existed thousands of years earlier, but consciousness could not have emerged without language. The idea that language is a necessary component of subjective consciousness and more abstract forms of thinking has gained the support of proponents including Andy Clark, Daniel Dennett, William H. Calvin, Merlin Donald, John Limber, Howard Margolis, Peter Carruthers, and Jos√© Luis Berm√∫dez. Williams (2010) defended Jaynes against the criticism of Block (1981). Asaad & Shapiro (1987) questioned why Jaynes's theory was left out of a discussion on auditory hallucinations. The author's (1987) published response was: ... Jaynes' hypothesis makes for interesting reading and stimulates much thought in the receptive reader. It does not, however, adequately explain one of the central mysteries of madness: hallucination. (Moffic, 1987) However Moffic's claim that there is no evidence for involvement of the right temporal lobe in auditory hallucination was incorrect, even at the time that he wrote it. More recently, a number of studies have provided more evidence of involvement of the right hemisphere in auditory hallucinations. The new evidence for Jaynes's model of auditory hallucinations arising in the right temporal-parietal lobe and being transmitted to the left temporal-parietal lobe that these neuroimaging studies provide was specifically pointed out by Olin (1999) and by Sher (2000). For further discussion, see Marcel Kuijsten (2007). Brian J. McVeigh, a graduate student of Jaynes, maintains that many of the most frequent criticisms of Jaynes's theory are either incorrect or reflect serious misunderstandings of Jaynes's theory, especially Jaynes's more precise definition of consciousness. Jaynes defines consciousness‚Äîin the tradition of Locke and Descartes‚Äîas \\"that which is introspectable\\". Jaynes draws a sharp distinction between consciousness (\\"introspectable mind-space\\") and other mental processes such as cognition, learning, sensation, and perception. McVeigh argues that this distinction is frequently not recognized by those offering critiques of Jaynes's theory. =Individual scholars' comments= Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion (2006) wrote of The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind: > It is one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of > consummate genius; Nothing in between! Probably the former, but I'm hedging > my bets. The philosopher Daniel Dennett suggested that Jaynes may have been wrong about some of his supporting arguments ‚Äì especially the importance he attached to hallucinations ‚Äì but that these things are not essential to his main thesis: > If we are going to use this top-down approach, we are going to have to be > bold. We are going to have to be speculative, but there is good and bad > speculation, and this is not an unparalleled activity in science. ... Those > scientists who have no taste for this sort of speculative enterprise will > just have to stay in the trenches and do without it, while the rest of us > risk embarrassing mistakes and have a lot of fun. ‚Äî Daniel Dennett Gregory Cochran, a physicist and adjunct professor of anthropology at the University of Utah, wrote: > Genes affecting personality, reproductive strategies, cognition, are all > able to change significantly over few-millennia time scales if the > environment favors such change‚Äîand this includes the new environments we > have made for ourselves, things like new ways of making a living and new > social structures. ... There is evidence that such change has occurred. ... > On first reading, Breakdown seemed one of the craziest books ever written, > but Jaynes may have been on to something. Author and historian of science Morris Berman writes: \\"[Jaynes's] description of this new consciousness is one of the best I have come across.\\" Danish science writer Tor N√∏rretranders discusses Jaynes's theory favorably in his 1991 book. Iain McGilchrist, who published a similar idea, accepts Jaynes's intention, but proposes that Jaynes's hypothesis was the opposite of what happened: > I believe he [Jaynes] got one important aspect of the story back to front. > His contention that the phenomena he describes came about because of a > breakdown of the 'bicameral mind' ‚Äì so that the two hemispheres, previously > separate, now merged ‚Äì is the precise inverse of what happened. Issues with Jaynes's proposal =Epic of Gilgamesh as a counter-example= As an argument against Jaynes's proposed date of the transition from bicameralism to consciousness, some critics have referred to the Epic of Gilgamesh. Early copies of the epic are many centuries older than even the oldest passages of the Old Testament, and yet it describes introspection and other mental processes that, according to Jaynes, were impossible for the bicameral mind. Jaynes noted that the most complete version of the Gilgamesh epic dates to post-bicameral times (7th century BCE), dismisses these instances of introspection as the result of rewriting and expansion by later conscious scribes, and points to differences between the more recent version of Gilgamesh and surviving fragments of earlier versions: \\"The most interesting comparison is in Tablet X.\\" His answer, however, does not deal with the generally accepted dating of the \\"Standard Version\\" of the Gilgamesh epic to the later 2nd millennium BCE, nor does it account for the introspection characteristic of the \\"Standard Version\\" being thoroughly rooted in the Old Babylonian and Sumerian versions, especially as historians' understanding of the Old Babylonian poem improves.For a through overview of the current understanding of the Gilgamesh Epic's textual history, see: =Simultaneous, world-wide transition= Jaynes's proposal does not explain how bicameralism could have been lost at the same time across the entire human species. The indigenous Australian culture was completely separated from the rest of the world from 4000 BCE to 1600 CE, yet appears today to be both historically unchanged and self-conscious. =Pre-transition divination= Divination is also considerably older than that date and the early writings he claims show bicamerality: The oldest recorded Chinese Writing was on oracle bones, meaning that divination arose at the same time or even earlier than writing in Chinese society. =Recent cultural ancestor-worship= While he said ancient societies engaged in ancestor worship before this date, non- ancient societies also engaged in it after that date; very advanced societies like the Aztecs and Egyptians mummified and deified rulers (see Pyramids and the philosopher Nezahualcoyotl). The Aztecs and Incans did so all the way up to their conquest by the Spanish. =Sense of agency dependent on lateralization= It is now known that the sense of agency is closely connected with lateralization: The left parietal lobe is active when visualizing actions by the self, while the right parietal lobe is active for actions by others. Additionally, Wernicke's area processes the literal meaning of language, while the homologous region in the right hemisphere processes the intent of a speaker. It has been found that people with damage to the right inferior parietal cortex experience alien hand syndrome, as do people who have had a corpus callosotomy. This reverses the relationship between the right and left hemispheres posited by Jaynes's proposed bicameralism: It is the left hemisphere that is responsible for speech and the right hemisphere that is responsible for self-awareness. Similar ideas V. S. Ramachandran, in his 2003 book The Emerging Mind, proposes a similar concept, referring to the left cortical hemisphere as an \\"apologist\\", and the right cortical hemisphere as a \\"revolutionary\\". In his book Neuroreality: A Scientific Religion to Restore Meaning, or How 7 Brain Elements Create 7 Minds and 7 Realities, Bruce E. Morton, formerly of the University of Hawaii, similarly proposed such a concept. Psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist reviews scientific research into the role of the brain's hemispheres, and cultural evidence, in his book The Master and His Emissary. Similar to Jaynes, McGilchrist proposes that since the time of Plato the left hemisphere of the brain (the \\"emissary\\" in the title) has increasingly taken over from the right hemisphere (the \\"master\\"), to our detriment. McGilchrist, while accepting Jayne's intention, felt that Jaynes's hypothesis was \\"the precise inverse of what happened\\" and that rather than a shift from bicameralism there evolved a separation of the hemispheres to bicameralism. (See McGilchrist quotation, above.) Michael Gazzaniga pioneered the split-brain experiments which led him to propose a similar theory called the left brain interpreter. Neuroscientist Michael Persinger, who co-invented the \\"God helmet\\" in the 1980s, believes that his invention may induce mystical experiences by having the separate right hemisphere consciousness intrude into the awareness of the normally-dominant left hemisphere.

He was born and died in Antwerp. He was trained in drawing by his father Ferdinand de Braekeleer, a well-known genre painter, and his uncle Jan August Hendrik Leys. Braekeleer entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) in 1854. Although he remained a student there until 1861, he publicly exhibited his paintings for the first time in 1858, when Reaper and Washerwoman (locations unknown) were shown at the Antwerp Salon. In 1863, he went to Germany and, in 1864, to the Netherlands, studying works by 16th- and 17th-century painters in both countries. The influence of Johannes Vermeer was especially important, seen in one of de Braekeleer's most characteristic subjects: a single person absorbed in a quiet activity, shown in an interior lit by a window. In 1869, de Braekeleer signed a contract with the Belgian art dealer, Gustave Co√ªteaux, a relationship that continued until 1876. In the same year, his uncle Baron Leys died. The two events combined to create the most productive period in de Braekeleer's career, when he made the works for which he is best known and received public recognition for them. In 1872, he received a gold medal at the Salon in Brussels for The Geographer and The Lesson and, in 1873, a gold medal at the International Exhibition in Vienna for The Painter's Studio and Grandmother's Birthday Celebration (all in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Brussels). However, apparently because of depression, he seems to have stopped painting between 1879 and 1881. When he started to work again, he used a shorter and more visible brushstroke, perhaps as a result of the influence of the Impressionists. Vincent van Gogh mentioned de Braekeleer in letters to his brother Theo several times, referring to him as an artist he liked as well as one afflicted by mental illness.

Family Maathorneferure was a daughter of the Hittite king Hattusili III and his wife, Queen Puduhepa. She was the sister of the crown prince Nerikkaili of Hatti and the sister of the later Hittite king Tudhaliya IV. Maathorneferure was married to the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 34th year of his reign, becoming the King's Great Wife. Her original name is unknown, but her Egyptian name translates as \\"One who sees Horus, the invisible splendor of Ra\\". Life Piece of papyrus bearing the name of Maathorneferura, the Hittite princesess daughter of the great ruler of Khatti who married Ramesses II. From Gurob, Fayum, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Maathorneferure and Hattusili III before Ramesses II Egypt and the Hittite empire had been increasingly at odds since the demise of the kingdom of the Mitanni, and Maathorneferure's marriage to the Egyptian king was the conclusion of the peace process which had begun with the signing of a peace treaty thirteen years earlier. On the Marriage Stela it is claimed that \\"The daughter of the great chief of Kheta marched in [front] of the army [...]\\" J.H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Three, ¬ß 415ff. The Hittite princess left Hattusa, the Hittite capital, in late 1246 BCE, accompanied by her mother and a huge contingent laden with gold, silver, bronze, cattle and sheep, and slaves. At the Egyptian frontier, a message was despatched to the Pharaoh: 'They have traversed sheer mountains and treacherous passes to reach Your Majesty's border.' Ramesses sent a welcoming party to escort the princess through Canaan and into Egypt. She arrived in February 1245 BCE at Pi-Ramesse. For Ramesses, the marriage was valuable more for the large dowry he acquired rather than his new bride, who was despatched to his harem palace at Mer-wer (today's Gurob). According to another account, however, Maathorneferure is said to have given Ramesses a baby (a girl called Neferure, according to the Abydos procession) and died shortly thereafter. Maathorneferure is mentioned on a papyrus found at Gurob. The partial text on the papyrus states: [...] small bag, the king's wife Maathorneferure (may she live) (the daughter of) the great ruler of Khatti, [...] Dayt garment of 28 cubits, 4 palms, breadth 4 cubits, [bag?] of 14 cubits, 2 palms, breath 4 cubits - 2 items [...] palms, breath 4 cubits. Gurob, papyrus 32795 At Tanis, there is a broken statue of Ramesses that shows her (mostly destroyed) figure touching his leg, together with her cartouche. During the latter half of the first millennium BCE Maathorneferure's marriage to the pharaoh gave rise to the tale inscribed on the Bentresh stela in which the sister of a foreign queen is healed by a divine statue sent from Egypt.The Bentresh Stela Alternative spellings * Maat-hor-neferure * Maatnefrure * Maat-hor-nefrure * Naptera References * \\"Marriage Stela\\" in Ancient Records of Egypt by J.

An Italian gastronomic society, Accademia Italiana della Cucina, documented several rag√π recipes. The recipes' common characteristics are the presence of meat and the fact that all are sauces for pasta. The most typical are rag√π alla bolognese (Bolognese sauce). Other types are rag√π alla napoletana (Neapolitan rag√π), and rag√π alla Barese (sometimes made with horse meat). Varieties In northern Italian regions, rag√π typically uses minced, chopped or ground meat, cooked with sauteed vegetables in a liquid. The meats may include one or more of beef, chicken, pork, duck, goose, lamb, mutton, veal, or game, including their offal. The liquids can be broth, stock, water, wine, milk, cream or tomato, often in combination. If tomatoes are included, they are typically limited relative to the meat, making it a meat stew rather than a tomato sauce with added meat. In southern Italian regions, rag√π is often prepared from substantial quantities of large, whole cuts of beef and pork, and sometimes regional sausages, cooked with vegetables and tomatoes. After a long braise (or simmer), the meats are removed and may be served as a separate course without pasta. Examples of these dishes are rag√π alla Napoletana (Neapolitan rag√π) and carne al rag√π. History Etymologically speaking, the term comes from the French rago√ªt and reached the region of Emilia-Romagna in the late 18th century, perhaps following Napoleon's 1796 invasion and occupation of those northern regions. Prior to that time, peninsula cuisine had a long history of meat stews going back to the Renaissance period. However, they were neither known as rag√π nor is there any record of pairing them with pasta. Starting in the 16th century, it was not uncommon for pasta to be cooked in and served with a meat broth, often like a simple soup, from which the meat was removed and served separately, if eaten at all. The first documented recipe for a meat sauce, in which the cooked meat was an integral part of the sauce served with pasta, dates from the end of the 18th century. The first rag√π as a sauce, rag√π per i maccheroni, was prepared and recorded by Alberto Alvisi, the cook to the Cardinal of Imola (at the time maccheroni was a general term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The recipe was replicated and published as Il Rag√π del Cardinale (The Cardinal's Rag√π). After the early 1830s, recipes for rag√π appear frequently in cookbooks from the Emilia-Romagna region. By the late 19th century, the use of heavy meat sauces on pasta was common on feast days and Sundays only with the wealthier classes of the newly unified Italy, given the expense of meat. Independent research by Kasper and De Vita indicates that, while rag√π with pasta gained popularity through the 19th century, it was largely eaten by the wealthy. However, technological advances that came with the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century made pasta flour more affordable for the less affluent. The adoption of pasta by the common classes further expanded in the period of economic prosperity that followed World War II. According to De Vita, before World War II, 80% of the Italian rural population ate a diet based on plants; pasta was reserved for special feast days and was then often served in a legume soup.

Bush on July 9, 2005. The law amends the Communications Act of 1934, significantly altering some aspects of prior amendments made by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 as they relate to the issue of junk fax. History of junk fax legislation Congress first addressed the issue of junk faxes in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA). Although this legislation dealt broadly with larger issues of nuisance telemarketing tactics, it included provisions making it illegal for any person to send an unsolicited advertisement to a fax machine.. The law further authorized the recipient of a fax sent in violation of the statute (or a regulation promulgated under the statute) to sue the sender in state court to enjoin further violation, recover for actual monetary losses from such a violation, $500 in statutory damages for each violation (whichever is greater), or both.. The law also allows the court, in its discretion, to treble these damages if it finds the defendant violated the statute \\"willfully\\" or \\"knowingly.\\" After the bill was enacted, many companies that continued to send junk faxes were sued, often for substantial sums. The most well-known sender of junk faxes, fax.com, was repeatedly sued by government agencies and private individuals. Most notably, the company found itself faced with a $2.2 trillion suit filed by anti-junk fax crusader Steve Kirsch.http://www.junkfax.org/fax/reference/other_cases/FaxcomState.doc The company was eventually forced out of business, though the fax.com website has since been purchased by an unrelated company. As a result, many companies moved across the border into Canada or Mexico, or set up operations overseas to continue broadcasting into the United States. To counter this, Congress made a small but significant amendment to the statute in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Public Law No. 108-187). This amendment made it illegal for sending junk faxes from within the United States, but also if they were sent into the United States from outside the country. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also promulgated regulations under the TCPA. Most of these regulations were designed to reduce the liability of senders of junk faxes. For instance, the FCC created an exemption for fax broadcasters similar to the \\"common carrier\\" exceptions created for telephone companies47 C.F.R. 64.1200. and an exemption for advertisements sent to recipients with whom the sender had an existing business relationship (\\"EBR\\") if the sender included a proper opt out clause. While many defendants in junk fax suits attempted to rely on these regulations, they were almost uniformly unsuccessful because courts repeatedly ruled that the FCC had been without statutory authority to create such exceptions.For examples, see Texas v. American Blastfax, Inc., 121 F. Supp. 2d 1085 (W.D. Texas 2000); Covington & Burling v. Int'l Marketing and Research, Inc., 2003 D.C. Super. LEXIS 29, *8-11; Accounting Outsourcing, L.L.C. v. Verizon Wireless Personal Communications, L.P., 329 F. Supp. 2d 789 (M.D. La Aug. 5, 2004); Rodriguez v. United States, 480 US 522 (1987); and Altman v. Inside Edge, Inc., 2004 TCPA Rep 1291, *2 (Mo. Cir. Aug. 2, 2004). The Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 made small but significant changes to the TCPA. Most notably, it amended the statute to legislate the EBR exemption previously promulgated by the FCC. However, the bill was not amended to authorize the FCC's so-called \\"common carrier\\" exemption. Effect  Under the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, the sender of an unsolicited advertisement sent to a person's fax machine is still liable for a minimum of $500 per page, and damages may also be trebled at the court's discretion upon a finding that the violation was willful or knowing. A \\"willful\\" violation is simply one that is \\"volitional\\", while a \\"knowing\\" violation is one that occurs when the senders actually knew \\"or should have known\\" that he was potentially breaking a law, even without specific knowledge of the law. The statute is one of strict liability; even if one sends an unsolicited advertisement by fax by accident, minimum liability of $500 per page attaches. The only real defense for the sender is that the transmission was protected by the EBR exception created by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005. To qualify the sender: # must already have an EBR with the recipient; # must have received the recipient's fax number voluntarily from the recipient in the context of the EBR; and # A notice on the first page of the unsolicited advertisement that instructs the recipient how to request that they not receive future unsolicited facsimile advertisement.21 FCC Rcd 3787, 3800 (FCC 2006); and # A domestic contact telephone number to opt out. and # A facsimile machine number to opt out. and # At least one cost-free mechanism for transmitting an opt-out request. and # It must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.21 FCC Rcd 3787, 3818 (FCC 2006); and # The notice must be clear and conspicuous and on the first page of the advertisement 21 FCC Rcd 3787, 3801 (FCC 2006); and # The notice must be distinguishable from the advertising material through, for example, use of bolding, italics, different font, or the like. and # It cannot be in the form of a \\"negative option. A facsimile advertisement containing a telephone number and an instruction to call if the recipient no longer wishes to receive such faxes, would constitute a \\"negative option\\" as the sender presumes consent unless advised otherwise.21 FCC Rcd 3787, 3811 (FCC 2006); and # the sender must honor all opt-out requests within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed thirty days). Failure to comply with all of these requirements leaves the sender liable for a violation of the statute, and unable to claim protection under this exception. http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-06-42A1.pdf See Par. 8(C)(iii). Criticism Advertisers and fax broadcasters welcomed the JFPA as providing a means of advertising to existing customers. They point out that before the JFPA, companies could not legally send regular customers advertisements and notices of special discounts via fax. Under the amended statute, the EBR exception allows them to do this. On the other hand, advocates for consumers and small businesses have also been harshly critical of the JFPA. Critics point out that the bill \\"for the first time in history... legalized the taking of your property from you without your consent by another person or private entity.\\" They note that, even when companies send notices that could potentially save the recipients money, the senders are still doing so with the expectation that they will make sales and they are advertising for these sales by stealing the paper, supplies, and time of the recipients. Some have gone so far as to rename the JFPA the \\"Junk Fax Protection Act of 2005\\". Defendants in civil suits brought pursuant to this statute often argue they have the affirmative defense of the \\"established business relationship.\\" Yet, as is often proven in Court, the defense fails if the Defendant did not comply with 21 FCC Rcd 3787, i.e. that a valid \\"Opt-out\\" clause was part of the offending fax. If there is no valid opt-out clause, the defendant cannot take advantage of the affirmative defense of an \\"established business relationship.\\" See 21 FCC Rcd 3787.

All but one of the stories (\\"Come Live With Me\\") had previously been published elsewhere, in Science fiction magazines or anthologies. It is copyrighted to ‚Äúthe Estate of Alice B. Sheldon‚Äù and was first published in 1988 by Tom Doherty Associates. Crown of Stars is 340 pages in length. Here we have ten short stories that generally represent Sheldon‚Äôs last contributions to literature, said to include her final burst of creativity. Contents * \\"Second Going\\" (1987) The first two stories in Crown of Stars: ‚ÄúSecond Going‚Äù and ‚ÄúOur Resident Djinn‚Äù are about God, gods, and the death of God. ‚ÄúSecond Going‚Äù is the collection‚Äôs centerpiece, a true science fiction classic. Narrated as a documentary from NASA‚Äôs chief archivist, we learn of humanity‚Äôs First Contact. Interstellar-wandering, telepathic aliens contact Earth after we launch our first manned mission to Mars, stating that they will meet with the astronauts once they arrive. The Angli (large, blue cephalopods) turn out to be benevolent, if technologically simple, space tourists. They are interested in spending several months exploring Earth, then moving on. They are puzzled, though, by the lack of living gods on Earth; which exist on every other planet they have visited. * \\"Our Resident Djinn\\" (1986) \\"Our Resident Djinn,\\" on the other hand, opens cold with the death of God. Satan has just gotten the news of his rival's death from an angelic messenger and decides the best thing would be for him to fly up to the heavenly kingdom to pay his last respects to his old adversary. St. Peter gives Satan a tour of the empty capitol, which is to be sold off piecemeal in a sort of divine Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. * \\"Morality Meat\\" (1985, credited to Raccoona Sheldon) Basically, this is the tale of a 16-year-old black girl living in a right-wing, dystopian future California. After being raped, she has no choice but to become a single mother, since abortions are illegal. She is forced to give her baby up for adoption, since she cannot afford to feed two. * \\"All This and Heaven Too\\" (1985) ‚ÄúAll This and Heaven Too,‚Äù on the other hand, is a pleasant tale about young lovers, fairy-tale geopolitics, and ridiculous court intrigue. Set in a happy, utopian kingdom and an adjacent polluted, industrial kingdom, the principalities‚Äô heirs fall in love. * \\"Yanqui Doodle\\" (1987) The US is fighting a full-fledged war in Latin-America and the Congressional Armed Services Committee is on a tour of the front and will soon stop at a field hospital to visit the wounded. Soldiers are encouraged to take government- issued drugs (mainly amphetamines) to become remorseless killing machines. A soldier is recovering from a landmine explosion in this field hospital and it quickly becomes clear that drug withdrawal is a far more serious concern than his wounds. * \\"Come Live with Me\\" (1988) The sixth story, \\"Come Live With Me,\\" is one of the last stories written by Tiptree. It is the only story in this collection regarding the far future and deep space. It's a quick, simple tale of a deep-space exploration crew's encounter with a mind-controlling lily, mainly from the plant's perspective. The plant has never encountered a being more intelligent than a space beaver, so meeting humans and their egos is a big change. * \\"Last Night and Every Night\\" (1970) * \\"In Midst of Life\\" (1987) Both are about humans who are transformed into Death‚Äôs servants. * \\"Backward, Turn Backward\\" (1988)' The tale of a riches-to-rags debutante, Diane, who temporarily changes places with her future self. A few months after this was written, Alice Sheldon shot her husband, then herself, in their bed, which was somewhat prefigured by the story. * \\"The Earth Doth Like a Snake Renew\\" (1988) [Written in 1973 by Raccoona Sheldon] \\"The Earth Doth Like a Snake Renew,\\" is a reversal of the earlier Tiptree story, \\"The Last Flight of Doctor Ain,\\" her first widely acclaimed piece.James Tiptree, Jr In this story, the Earth is male and the main character is a young woman named \\"P.\\" P is in love with the Earth and obsessively desires to find a way to physically consummate that love. She is also a submissive masochist. The relationship between the two is portrayed as abusive, with the Earth harming and manipulating the protagonist, while simultaneously providing for her. Ultimately, the Earth is shown to not truly love her, but, rather, to love another planetoid. This planetoid crashes into the Earth, knocking it off its orbit and killing all life, including P. Just as the love was one directional, so was the power. Awards and Accolades Crown of Stars received a nomination for the 1989 Locus Award for Best Collection. The story \\"Come Live with Me,\\" the only original story in the collection, was the winner of the Hayakawa Award for foreign short story in 1997.

Two prosthetic groups, a Rieske-type [Fe2S2] center and a mononuclear iron, are associated with the Œ±-subunit in the (Œ±Œ≤)n-type enzymes. Electron transfer components are composed of flavoprotein (NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) and Rieske-type [Fe2S2] ferredoxin. In benzoate and toluate 1,2-dioxygenase systems, a single protein containing reductase and Rieske-type ferredoxin domains transfers the electrons from NADH to the hydroxylase component. In the phthalate 4,5-dioxygenase system, phthalate dioxygenase reductase (PDR) has the same function. PDR is a single protein comprising FMN-binding reductase and plant-type ferredoxin domains. Thus, the electron transfer in ARHD systems can be summarised as: { border=\\"0\\" width=\\"60%\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\"  NADH  ‚Üí  bgcolor=\\"yellow\\"  reductase FAD or FMN  ‚Üí  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\"  ferredoxin [Fe2S2]  ‚Üí  bgcolor=\\"lightblue\\"  hydroxylase Œ±-subunit [Fe2S2], Fe } Biochemical classification benzene 1,2-dioxygenase : benzene + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = cis-cyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol + NAD+ phthalate 4,5-dioxygenase : phthalate + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = cis-4,5-dihydroxycyclohexa-1(6),2-diene-1,2-dicarboxylate + NAD+ 4-sulfobenzoate 3,4-dioxygenase : 4-sulfobenzoate + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate + sulfite + NAD+ 4-chlorophenylacetate 3,4-dioxygenase : 4-chlorophenylacetate + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate + chloride + NAD+ benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase : benzoate + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate + NAD+ toluene dioxygenase : toluene + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = (1S,2R)-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol + NAD+ naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase : naphthalene + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = (1R,2S)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol + NAD+ terephthalate 1,2-dioxygenase : terephthalate + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = (1R,6S)-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,4-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate + NAD+ biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase : biphenyl + NADH + H+ \\\\+ O2 = (1S,2R)-3-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol + NAD+ Structure The crystal structure of the hydroxylase component of naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas has been determined. The protein is an (Œ±Œ≤)3 hexamer. The Œ≤-subunit belongs to the Œ±+Œ≤ class. It has no prosthetic groups and its role in catalysis is unknown. The Œ±-subunit can be divided into two domains: a Rieske domain that contains the [Fe2S2] center and the catalytic domain that contains the active site mononuclear iron. The Rieske domain (residues 38-158) consists of four Œ≤-sheets. The overall fold is very similar to that of the soluble fragment of the Rieske protein from bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex. In the [Fe2S2] center, Fe1 is coordinated by two cysteine residues (Cys-81 and Cys-101) while Fe2 is coordinated by NŒ¥ atoms of two histidine residues (His-83 and His-104). The catalytic domain belongs to the Œ±+Œ≤ class and is dominated by a nine-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet. The iron of the active site is located at the bottom of a narrow channel, approximately 15 √Ö from the protein surface. The mononuclear iron is coordinated by His-208, His-213, Asp-362 (bidentate) and a water molecule. The geometry can be described as a distorted octahedral with one ligand missing. The structure of the hexamer suggests cooperativity between adjacent Œ±-subunits, where electrons from the [Fe2S2] center in one Œ±-subunit (A) are transferred to the mononuclear iron in the adjacent Œ±-subunit (B) through AspB-205, which is hydrogen-bonded to HisA-104 of the Rieske center and HisB-208 of the active site.

Only eighth notes (quavers) or shorter can be beamed. The number of beams is equal to the number of flags that would be present on an unbeamed note. Beaming refers to the conventions and use of beams. A primary beam connects a note group unbroken, while a secondary beam is interrupted or partially broken. Grouping The span of beams indicates the rhythmic grouping, usually determined by the time signature. Therefore, beams do not usually cross bar lines or major subdivisions of bars. If notes extend across these divisions, this is indicated with a tie. It is basically a line that joins notes together. A single eighth note, or any faster note, is always stemmed with flags, while two or more are usually beamed in groups.Gerou, Tom (1996). Essential Dictionary of Music Notation, p. 211. Alfred. In modern practice, beams may span across rests in order to make rhythmic groups clearer. In vocal music, beams were traditionally used only to connect notes sung to the same syllable. In modern practice it is more common to use standard beaming rules, while indicating multi-note syllables with slurs. Positioning Read, Gardner (1979). Music Notation, p. 89. Crescendo. Notes joined by a beam usually have all the stems pointing in the same direction (up or down). The average pitch of the notes is used to determine the direction ‚Äì if the average pitch is below the middle staff-line, the stems and beams usually go above the notehead, otherwise they go below. The direction of beams usually follows the general direction of the notes it groups, slanting down if the notes go down, slanting up if the notes go up, and level if the first and last notes are the same. Feathered beaming Feathered beams Feathered beaming shows a gradual change in the speed of notes. It is shown with a primary straight beam and other diagonal secondary beams (that together resemble a feather, hence the name). These secondary beams suggest a gradual acceleration or deceleration from the first note value within the feathered beam to the last. The longest value possible to show being the eighth note (quaver). When the number of notes played is not of interest, but rather the effect of acceleration or deceleration, an approximate number of headless stems are used. To ensure clarity, sometimes the number of notes within the beam, or the duration of the total beamed notes, is shown above the music, as is done with tuplets. Tremolo, reiteration Reiteration ( and ) Beams are also used as a notational abbreviation to indicate tremolos and reiterations. If used for those purposes, a note, or pair of notes, of any value can be beamed.

Ross Lederman, scripted by Karl Brown and David Silverstein from a story by Richard English and released as a low-budget programmer by Columbia Pictures on August 6, 1940. It is one of numerous military-school or patriotic-adventure-themed, quickly-produced second features for a primarily juvenile audience, which every studio rushed before the cameras following the September 1939 outbreak of war in Europe and, subsequently, the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, passed by Congress on September 14 and signed by President Franklin Roosevelt on September 16. Starting in November 1939 with Warners' On Dress Parade, which became better known as The Dead End Kids on Dress Parade, virtually all male adolescents working in Hollywood were put through their on- screen paces. Tommy Kelly and Jackie Moran who had starred as Tom and Huck in 1938's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer appeared in Military Academy and 1939's The Spirit of Culver, respectively. Culver, another version of the military- school classic, Tom Brown of Culver, starred former child stars Jackie Cooper and Freddie Bartholomew, who were also being cast in other similar productions. Bartholomew's next titles, in fact, were Naval Academy, Cadets on Parade and Junior Army. Military Academy presents top-billed Tommy Kelly as a fifteen-year-old sent to the title institution under an assumed surname, because his father, a well-known crime figure, although now reformed, has made the family name so notorious that his relatives find it difficult to relate to society at large once the truth becomes known. At the school he makes friends with two other misfits ‚Äî second-billed Bobby Jordan, primarily known as a key member of the Dead End Kids acting ensemble, but here revising his usual character to portray a cocky champion athlete whose self-aggrandizing behavior alienates him from most fellow cadets, and third-billed David Holt who played the pampered sissy and prissy cousin Sid Sawyer to Tommy Kelly's Tom in the 1938 film, and was again cast as a similar type, an overprotected son of a wealthy family who cannot adjust himself to the strict regimen. Fourth-billed Jackie Searl, at nineteen, playing a senior cadet, had the longest career among the junior cast members, with credits going back to the beginning of sound in 1929, almost always portraying sneaky, nasty, pampered, disagreeable kids, including an earlier prototype of cousin Sid to Jackie Coogan's Tom in the 1930 Tom Sawyer and its 1931 sequel, Huckleberry Finn. True to form, his upperclassman character immediately becomes the nemesis of the three younger boys. At midpoint, Tommy Kelly's family name is exposed and he faces ostracism from fellow cadets, except for his two friends who continue to support him. Ultimately, however, all the boys prove themselves to be fine, upstanding, patriotic young Americans on the eve of World War II. The remaining cast members are Don Beddoe as Tommy Kelly's former-gangster father, Jimmy Butler as Cadet Dewey, Walter Tetley as Cadet Blackburn and Earle Foxe, Eddie Dew and Warren Ashe as the officers in charge, Major Dover, Captain Kendall and Captain Banning, respectively. Last-billed, and introduced to Tommy Kelly in the final scene as David Holt's appealing sister, Marjorie, is fifteen-year- old Joan Brodel who, rechristened Joan Leslie, would be launched by Warner Bros. as an ingenue and, subsequently, leading lady of the 1940s in a film released five months after Military Academy, High Sierra.

The Capitol is at the intersection of Apalachee Parkway and South Monroe Street in downtown Tallahassee, Florida. Sometimes called \\"The Old Capitol,\\" the Historic Capitol, built in 1845, was threatened with demolition in the late 1970s when the new capitol building was built. Having been restored to its 1902-version in 1982, the Historic Capitol is directly behind the new Capitol building. Its restored space includes the Governor's Suite, Supreme Court, House of Representatives and Senate chambers, rotunda, and halls. Its adapted space contains a museum exhibiting the state's political history, the Florida Historic Capitol Museum, which is managed by the Florida Legislature. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the Historic Capitol Building (Restoration) on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places. The New Tower houses executive and legislative offices and the chambers of the Florida Legislature (consisting of the Florida Senate and Florida House of Representatives). The Florida Department of Management Services maintains the Capitol Complex, which is open to the public Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (excluding state holidays). Names The buildings are universally, though informally, known as the Old Capitol and the New Capitol; the former is sometimes called the Historic Capitol, or also, confusingly, the Florida State Capitol. The latter was its official name prior to the construction of the New Capitol in 1977, and was so called by the National Park Service even after the New Capitol was operating.\\"Tech Notes\\", http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/tech-notes/Tech-Notes-Windows07.pdf, retrieved 9/20/2015. Its legal name today, however, is the Florida Historic Capitol Museum.http://www.flhistoriccapitol.gov/, retrieved 9/20/2015. The New Capitol, as a whole, does not have a legal name. When it was planned, the Capitol Complex (which is a legal name) was going to consist of the House and Senate chambers, and the twenty-two-story office building. History Completion of the renovations to the Historic Capitol's Dome Former Senate chamber in the Old Capitol Tallahassee was named Florida's capital in 1824, midway between the then-largest cities in the state, St. Augustine and Pensacola. The first territorial government met in a log building. A capitol building was constructed in 1826 but never completely finished. It was torn down in 1839 to make room for the erection of the present structure, which was completed in 1845, just prior to Florida's entry into the United States as the 27th state. Several additions to the historic capitol have been made throughout the years. Frank Pierce Milburnhttps://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/24593 made the first expansion in 1902 by adding the classical style dome. In 1923, Henry Klutho additions included two new wings and a marble interior. Finally, large wings for the House and Senate chambers were added to the north and south ends of the building in 1936 and 1947, respectively. The 1902 Capitol building was the last statehouse in which all of Florida's political business was housed under one roof. A decade later, the Florida Supreme Court moved into its own building. Florida's current Supreme Court building is just west of the Capitol Complex, across S. Duval Street. =The decision to build a new capitol= The 1960s were a time of political renewal in Florida that led to the Constitution of 1968 and the end of the Pork Chop Gang. The thrust of the renewal was to force conservative, north Florida politicians to cede power to the greatly expanded (in population and economic power) central and south Florida, until then seriously underrepresented in the legislature. As part of this discussion, the possible relocation of Florida's capital (convenient only to the north Floridians) closer to the state's center of population was considered. A ballot question asked Florida voters to decide on the location of Florida's capital. Other major contenders were Ocala, Orlando, and Jacksonville. Through the ballot process, the voters decided the capital would remain in Tallahassee. The moment was \\"ripe\\" for spending money on state facilities in Tallahassee. A dividing line had been crossed. Florida was different, renewed, and a new capitol was psychologically appropriate. =The decision to preserve the Old Capitol= The architects who designed the New Capitol were given the starting assumption the Old Capitol -- which had to remain in use until the New Capitol was completed -- would be removed. Therefore, the design of the New Capitol in no way reflected the style of the old one. The site design, also, was prepared under the assumption the space occupied by the Old Capitol would be vacant. Since the preservation movement did not begin until after the New Capitol had been competed, and the demolition was being prepared for, it was too late to make any changes to either the New Capitol or the site. The Historic Capitol was saved through citizens' action led by Secretary of State Bruce Smathers and then wife Nancy McDowell. The efforts were successful and the building was restored to its 1902 appearance, the final House and Senate chambers having been demolished (though there are no surviving drawings or photographs to inform restoration of the interior). Architectural highlights include the elaborate art glass dome, red and white striped awnings,These are discussed in a review of the engineering of the windows of the restored building, in a National Park Service publication, Tech Notes, http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/tech- notes/Tech-Notes-Windows07.pdf, retrieved 9/20/2015. and a representation of the Florida State Seal over the entry columns. In 2011, the Florida Department of Management Services, in conjunction with MLD Architects, began restoration of the Historic Capitol's cupola, which included new copper roofing, and Tallahassee's most photographed landmark unveiled its new dome in April 2012. The New Capitol =Architecture and layout= Florida Capitol buildings (Old Capitol in the foreground) The Capitol Complex design was a joint venture of the architectural firms of Edward Durell Stone of New York City and Reynolds, Smith & Hills of Jacksonville. It was built according to Stone's signature style of \\"Neoclassicism,\\" with an ornate grill surrounding a white- columned box. The design symbolized the growth and development of Florida. The Capitol is usually referred to as a twenty-two-story building with a height of 345 feet. However, including the 3 underground floors, it is a 25-story building (the 6th floor is only accessible through the freight elevator). The Governor and the Cabinet members have their offices on the Plaza Level of the Capitol. Floors two through four of the base structure of the Capitol are used for the chambers of the Senate and House of Representatives; the offices of the Senate President, Secretary and Sergeant at Arms; the House Speaker, Clerk, and Sergeant at Arms; some legislative committee offices and meeting rooms; and Member offices. The Legislative Chambers are on the fourth floor with their respective public viewing galleries on the fifth floor. The floors between the observation deck and the first five floors are executive and legislative offices. There is a cafeteria on the lower level, a snack bar on the tenth floor, and the Florida Welcome Center just inside the west Plaza Level entrance. Florida Welcome Center staff conducts guided tours for groups of 15 or more and self-guided tours are available during business hours. The Senate office building and the House office building are each four stories high and on either end of Capitol Complex. The bridges on the 2nd and 3rd floors allow people to walk between the Capitol and office buildings. These buildings contain primarily committee meeting rooms and legislative offices. The Knott Building was attached to the Capitol by a skywalk in 1999. The west front is known formally as Waller Park, for Curtis L. Waller, Judge of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2003, the dolphin statue \\"Stormsong\\" by Tallahassee artist Hugh Nicholson was added within Waller Park's Florida Heritage Fountain.  Points of interest  = Capitol grounds = Grounds of the Florida State Capitol On the northeast corner of the Capitol Complex is the Florida Sri Chinmoy Peace State Marker. East of the House Office Building is a replica of the Liberty Bell. The replica was a gift to the citizens of Florida as symbol of the 1950 United States Savings Bonds Independence Drive. Within the Capitol Courtyard is a memorial in remembrance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., dedicated in 1984. South of the King Memorial is The Florida Fraternal Order of Police Law Enforcement Memorial (dedicated in 2000). The memorial has the names of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Outside of the Senate Office Building is a monument dedicated to Floridians who have received the Purple Heart medal. On the lawn of the Old Capitol sit two marble obelisks. The northern one is the Leon County Civil War Memorial;https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=73047 former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum called for its removal. The other is a monument to Capt. John Parkhill who was killed at Palm Hammock, Florida leading the Leon Volunteers in pursuit of members of the Seminole Nation. Slightly northwest of the Civil War obelisk is Old Capitol Historical Marker. A plaque designating the legislative act naming this area after Judge Curtis L. Waller is on the south wall of the west park entrance. The Florida Heritage Fountain (and Stormsong dolphin statue by Tallahassee artist Hugh Nicholson) sits in the center of Waller Park. The Capitol Complex grounds are maintained by the Florida Department of Management Services.  The Capitol  Florida State Capitol interior The Plaza Level holds several items of note besides the offices of the Governor and the Cabinet. In the Rotunda, a copy of the State Seal cast in bronze is mounted on terra verde marble sits. This is not the current seal, but one in use when building was completed. It is surrounded by five smaller seals representing the nations and kingdoms that exerted sovereignty over all or parts of Florida (France, Spain, Great Britain, the Confederate States of America, and the United States). North of the Rotunda is the Florida Women's Hall of Fame and the Fallen Firefighters Wall of Honor. To the south are the Florida Artists Hall of Fame and a memorial for Florida's Medal of Honor recipients. Southwest of the Rotunda is the Heritage Chapel, an area designed to serve as a meditative space. Opposite to the Chapel is a plaque that states: \\"This plaque is dedicated to Senator Lee Weissenborn whose valiant effort to move the Capitol to Orlando was the prime motivation for the construction of this building.\\" The west Plaza Level is the Florida Welcome Center and the \\"Images of the Sunshine State\\" murals by Florida artist James Rosenquist. The Florida Welcome Center offers maps, brochures, including a self-guided tour pamphlet, and related information. The public viewing galleries for the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate are on the fifth floor. A series of murals of Florida's history by Christopher Still encircle the House chamber floor. Outside of the Senate galleries is the Five Flags Mural by Renee Faure depicting people from Florida history. The Observation Deck is the top or twenty-second floor of the Capitol building. The deck is above the Plaza Level and above sea level. In the east wing is an art gallery featuring a rotating display of artwork by Florida resident artists and a series of bronze plaques on the inductees of the Florida Artists Hall of Fame. The southern side is the Freedom Shrine. =Florida Legislative Research Center & Museum= The capitol is home to the Florida Legislative Research Center & Museum, which features exhibits about Florida's legislative history. The archives include art, historic photographs, documents and oral histories. The Gallery at the Historic Capitol features changing exhibits of photographs from the museum.

Obolonskyi District encompasses territories far beyond of its historical neighborhood sharing the same name. It was formed on 3 March 1975 and initially called as Minskyi District. In 2001 it was renamed to its historical name. Its current population is 290,000 inhabitants.  Overview  During Soviet rule of Ukraine, Kyiv had 14 administrative districts. In the early 21st century, a new law was passed and the city's administrative division was reorganized into 10 districts with different borders and new names. The Obolonskyi District encompasses the territories of the former Minskyi District and is still sometimes referred to by that name. It also includes the former town of Pushcha-Vodytsia that used to be part of the Podilskyi District. The name Obolon comes from the Old-Ukrainian word –æ–±–æ–ª–æ–Ω—å ‚Üí –±–æ–ª–æ–Ω—å ‚Üí –±–æ–ª–æ–Ω—å—î (obolon' ‚Üí bolon' ‚Üí bolon'ye), which roughly translates as \\"flood plain\\" or an area that is being engulfed by water. The district was built up in the 1970s as a microdistrict in Kyiv on the Obolon sands to satisfy the growth of the city. Due to the composition of the soil at the time, the majority of the buildings were at most nine stories tall, and few trees were planted when compared to other parts of the city. That and few other reasons originally made the district not very prestigious. With the second construction period (2000‚Äì2005), the district has seen new, comfortable apartment buildings constructed closer to the Dnieper river and has become an attractive residential area. The new apartments are also much more expensive, although still cheaper than in the central parts of Kyiv. The district was connected by metro in the 1980s, with a station Obolon opened on 5 November 1980. A yachting club for both kids and adults was opened in around 1990, and recently many of the Obolon lakes were cleaned up in order to make the area more attractive. The area closer to the Dnieper river is a popular relaxation place for Kyiv residents. The area is also well known for the beer factory Obolon CJSC. Park Natalka is among recreational spaces favored by Kyiv residents. It is located along the Dnieper river.  Major neighborhoods  * Obolon, a residential area (masyv) and an industrial zone of the Kyiv city. It is located between Dnieper river, Moscow Parkway, Verbova Street, and Dehtyarenko Street. * Kurenivka, an area towards the downtown of Kyiv. In the 17th century it used to be a suburb of the Kyiv city where the Kyiv Cossack Kosh was garrisoned. Its name is derived from one of the cossack's military formations, kurin (company). In the 18th century there was built the Petropavlivska Church that in the Soviet times was destroyed and rebuilt under one of the industrial buildings. Kurenivka is also became famous for a massive tragedy of the Kurenivka mudslide in 1961. * Priorka, it is believed to be settled by monks (priors) of the Dominican Order on the road to Vyshhorod. Since 1834 the settlement was incorporated into the Kyiv-city. * Minsky masyv, a residential area (masyv) of Kyiv. It is located between Shevchenko Square, Minsk Parkway, Konradyuk Street, Maiorov Street, Panch Street, Polyarna Street. The area also contains \\"sub-neighborhood\\" Kyn-Grust.

In 1832 he joined Professor Carl Henrik Boheman, a famous entomologist, on a collecting trip to Norway. In 1833 and 1834 he travelled in Sweden and Germany on forestry research projects. He joined the Office of Land Survey and was appointed an engineer in 1836, becoming an instructor at the Swedish Land Survey College. He travelled in southern Africa between 1838 and 1856, sending thousands of natural history specimens back to Sweden. He was exploring the Okavango area when he was killed, along the Thamalakane river about 10 km northwest of Maun in today's Botswana, by a wounded elephant. Before his death was known in Sweden, on October 8, 1856 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, since the news of his death had not reached Stockholm at this time.

Ugbaru remains a candidate for Gobryas being described as the ruler of the region of Gutium dying soon after the conquest of Babylon similarly to Xenophon's portrayal of Gobryas as an elderly \\"Assyrian\\" ruler.

Stretching roughly east to west and north to south, the Indian reservation is located in the Wind River Basin and includes portions of the Wind River Range, Owl Creek Mountains, and Absaroka Range. The Wind River Indian Reservation is the seventh-largest Indian reservation in the United States by area, and the fifth-largest American Indian reservation by population. The land area is approximately , and the total area (land and water) is . The reservation constitutes just over one-third of Fremont County and over one-fifth of Hot Springs County. The 2000 census reported the population of Fremont County as 40,237. According to the 2010 census, only 26,490 people now live on the reservation, with about 15,000 of the residents being non-Indians on ceded lands and the town of Riverton. Tribal headquarters are located at Fort Washakie. The Shoshone Rose Casino (Eastern Shoshone) and the Wind River Hotel and Casino, Little Wind Casino, and 789 Smoke Shop & Casino (all Northern Arapaho) are the only casinos in Wyoming. Prehistory The Shoshone have the longest prehistory in the area. Archaeologists have found evidence that unique aspects of the Tukudika Mountain Shoshone or Sheepeater material culture such as soapstone bowls were in use in this region from the early 1800s going back 1,000 to 3,000 years or more.Peter Nabokov, Lawrence L. Loendorf, Restoring a Presence: American Indians in Yellowstone National Park. University of Oklahoma Press, 2004 People descended from the Mountain Shoshone band continue to live on the Wind River Indian Reservation. The Dinwoody petroglyph style is indigenous to central Wyoming including the Wind River Basin and Bighorn Basin. Scholars believe that the Dinwoody petroglyphs most likely represent the work of ancestral Tukudika or Mountain Shoshone Sheepeaters. This is because some of the figures at Torrey Lake Petroglyph District and Legend Rock correspond to characters in Shoshone folklore, such as Pa waip, a water spirit woman. Pre-reservation tribal occupation Today's Wind River Indian Reservation is located at the historical boundary region between the Great Basin culture of the Shoshone and the Great Plains tribal cultures. In recent centuries, the area was used by many tribes for hunting grounds and for raiding. After 1800, the historical record notes the presence of the Shoshone, as well as the Crow, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Blackfeet and Lakota in the Wind River Basin. These latter tribes came to the area due to geopolitical forces, as well as for food resources: trapper records after 1800 describe huge herds of tens of thousands of stampeding bison in the Wind River Basin, raising massive clouds of dust on the horizon. The Shoshone largely controlled much of what is now western Wyoming in 1700s. This is because they were the first of the northern tribes to secure the horse from the Spanish and traders in the Southwest. (The Arapaho played a similar role of introducing the horse to the Great Plains, through trade between the Spanish settlements along the Rio Grande and the agricultural tribes along the Missouri River.) The Shoshones' dominance in what is now western Wyoming declined as other tribes like the Blackfeet acquired the horse and staged counter-raids. In the 1820s, the Shoshone started to regain power by trading for firearms in the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous fur trade in the Green River Basin, just over the Wind River Range from today's Wind River Indian Reservation. With the onset of the fur trade, Shoshones could once again project their power east from the Snake River and Green River Valley to hunt buffalo on the plains. Increasingly they needed to hunt farther east, because the fur trade started to wipe out bison in the Green River Basin. In the 1830s and 1840s they are recorded as raiding in the Platte River and Powder River basins, and the Laramie Plains. The Shoshone regularly used the Wind River Basin as winter range or as a route to hunting grounds in the Sweetwater, Bighorn Basin, Bighorn Mountains, or Powder River Basin. Coming from the other direction, the post-1600s westward migration of Siouan and Algonquian-speaking peoples brought new populations onto the plains and traditional Shoshone territory of the middle Rocky Mountains. The earliest of these midwestern, Missouri River, and Great Lakes tribes to migrate to the Great Plains include the Crow, Cheyenne, and Arapaho, though some sources say the Arapaho potentially occupied the Great Plains for 1,000 years. Most of these tribes were initially located on the Great Plains farther north and east of the Wind River area. The powerful and numerous Lakota were the last to push west in response to American expansion, bumping up against the earlier- migrating tribes, and then moving farther west into the Rocky Mountains. By the mid-1800s, all of these tribes would make incursions into the now- contested Wind River valley. Shoshone place names include dozens in the Bighorn Basin, demonstrating a detailed knowledge of lands further east than the Wind River Basin as part of traditional Shoshone territory. Likewise, the Arapaho were familiar with the Wind River Basin, referring to the Wind River/Bighorn River as Hotee Niicie, meaning \\"mountain sheep river\\", in reference to the numerous herds of the species in the area.Matthew J. Kauffman, James E. Meacham, Hall Sawyer, Alethea Y. Steingisser, William J. Rudd and Emilene Ostlind. Wild Migrations ‚Äì Atlas of Wyoming's Ungulates. Oregon State University Press. 2018. By the middle 1800s the Crow were largely dominant in the Wind River Valley and Absaroka Range, using the area as winter range, and fighting with Shoshones who came into the area. Crow Chief Arapooish mentioned the Wind River Valley as a preferred wintering ground with salt bush and cottonwood bark for horse forage in a speech recorded in the 1830s and published in Washington Irving's Adventures of Captain Bonneville. Meanwhile, Washakie and his people avoided the Crow treaty lands in the Wind River Valley in the 1850s, preferring to hunt away from the emigrant trails and the Crow in places like Henrys Fork and Yellowstone. The Crow dominance in the Wind River Valley, though secured as official Crow Territory under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, effectively ended when Chief Washakie defeated a Crow chief in one-on-one fight at Crowheart Butte, sometime in the late 1850s or early 1860s. Washakie likely opted to challenge the Crow because the emigrant trails and increasing white settlement in Utah, Idaho, and Montana made it harder to hunt in those areas. This left the Crow-occupied Wind River Valley as the only place Washakie could use force to secure hunting grounds from a rival tribe without significantly opposing American interests. The Crow legacy in the Wind River persists in the name of the Middle Fork Popo Agie River, pronounced \\"poepoe-zhuh\\", which comes from the Crow word Poppootch√°ashe, an onomatopoeia meaning \\"plopping river\\". The Crow word for the Green River, farther west, is Chiichkase Aashe or Seedskadee Aashe, meaning \\"sage hen river.\\" The Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868 effectively designated the Wind River Valley as exclusive territory of the Shoshone, superseding the Crow's 1851 Fort Laramie treaty claims. In 1872 the Shoshone agreed to sell part of the reservation to the U.S., establishing the North Fork of the Popo Agie River as a southern border. The reservation era Originally known as the Shoshone Indian Reservation, today's Wind River Indian Reservation was established by agreement of the United States with the Eastern Shoshone Nation at the Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868, restricting the tribe from the formerly vast Shoshone territory of more than . A later settlement and land transaction after United States v. Shoshone Tribe of Indians gave the Arapaho legal claim to the reservation, which was renamed the Wind River Indian Reservation. Washakie holding a pipe The Shoshone leader Washakie had a preference for the area, and had previously defeated the Crow in battle to hold the territory. As early as 1862, Indian Agent Luther Mann Jr. recommended creating a permanent reservation for the Shoshone. After prospectors discovered gold at South Pass in 1867, the United States Indian agent sought to limit numerous tribes from raiding mining camps by placing the Shoshone reservation in the Wind River Valley as a buffer. The United States hoped that tribes like the Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Lakota, and Arapaho would attack their traditional Shoshone enemies instead of the miners. However, the area was too dangerous for the Shoshone to occupy year-round, so Chief Washakie kept his people closer to Fort Bridger for several years after 1868. Washakie's son was killed in a raid by enemy tribes, and the Oglala Lakota leader Hump, a mentor of Crazy Horse, was killed fighting the Shoshone in the Wind River Basin. Intertribal conflicts occurred several times in the 1860s and 1870s in the Wind River region. The Arapaho briefly stayed in the Wind River valley in 1870, but left after miners and Shoshones attacked and killed tribal members and Black Bear, one of their leaders, as they moved lodges. At another event, a combined force of Lakotas, Cheyennes, and Arapahos surrounded and attacked Washakie's camp at Trout Creek on the reservation. The Shoshones survived the attack by digging rifle pits inside their tepees, and then mounting a counterattack. The last significant conflict occurred in June 1874, when 167 Shoshones and U.S. cavalry attacked the Arapaho at the Bates Battlefield on the head of Nowood Creek in the Bridger Mountains east of the Shoshone Indian Reservation. Camp Augur, a military post with troops named for General Christopher C. Augur, was established at the present site of Lander on June 28, 1869. (Augur was the general present at the signing of the Fort Bridger Treaty in 1868.) In 1870 the name of the camp was changed to Camp Brown, and in 1871, the post was moved to the current site of Fort Washakie. The name was changed to honor United States ally and Shoshone Chief Washakie in 1878. The fort continued to serve as a military post until the US abandoned it in 1909. By that time, a community had developed around the fort. Sacagawea, a guide with the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-06, was later interred here. Her son Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, who was a child on the expedition, has a memorial stone in Fort Washakie but was interred in Danner, Oregon. A government school and hospital operated for many years east of Fort Washakie; Arapaho children were sent here to board during the school year. St. Michael's at Ethete was constructed in 1917‚Äì1920. The village of Arapahoe was originally established as a US sub-agency to distribute rations to the Arapaho. At one time it also operated a large trading post. Irrigation was constructed to support farming and ranching in the arid region. The Arapaho constructed a flour mill near Fort Washakie. Separately, under the Dawes Act, communal tribal land was allotted to individual households, which could later be sold to non-tribal members, further diminishing the tribal land base. In 1904 the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho ceded a portion of the reservation north of the Wind River to the United States and opened to white settlement. The Riverton Reclamation Project and the city of Riverton developed on some of this land. Instead of a lump-sum payment or upfront purchase, the cession required the United States to pay the tribes for each area of land settled upon. Seeing that large parts of the ceded area were never taken up by settlers, the ceded portion of the reservation was later restored to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes. = Arapaho settlement on Wind River = In the winter of 1878-79, the United States Army escorted the Northern Arapaho to the Sweetwater Valley near Independence Rock and then temporarily placed them at the Shoshone's Fort Washakie Agency to receive rations. This decision to place the Arapaho in close proximity with their historic enemies the Shoshone has had significant historical and political consequences. Chief Black Coal, among the most influential Arapaho chiefs of his time. Chief Black Coal was able to largely keep the Arapaho at peace with the United States during the Great Sioux War of 1876. He served as a U.S. Army scout and helped the tribe find a home on Wind River. The former Arapaho and Cheyenne reservation under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 encompassing much of eastern Colorado and southeast Wyoming had been overrun by whites after the Colorado gold rush of 1859. The Northern Arapaho then signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, giving them claim to locate in the Great Sioux Reservation, encompassing the western half of present-day South Dakota west of the Missouri River, and rights to hunt north of the Platte River in Wyoming so long as game remained. In practice the Arapaho did not wish to locate permanently at an agency shared by the Sioux. They were belittled by leaders of the more powerful Sioux including Red Cloud, and wanted to avoid being culturally subsumed within the Lakota Nation. Instead, the Arapaho hoped for a reservation of their own. In 1868-69, the Arapaho briefly sought to locate with the linguistically-related Gros Ventres at the agency on the Milk River in Montana, but left after a smallpox epidemic. Further, Arapaho priest and leader Weasel Bear had a vision that the Arapaho would find a permanent home closer to the Rocky Mountains, and not on the Great Plains.Fowler, Loretta. Arapaho Politics, 1851-1978. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1982. The Arapaho way of life had historically included significant use of mountain hunting grounds, especially in the Colorado Rockies around Estes Park, but also including the Snowy Range, the Bighorns, the Black Hills, and the Laramie Range. To seek favor of the Army, leaders Chief Black Coal (Northern Arapaho), Sharp Nose and their followers allied with Gen. George Crook as scouts against their former allies the Cheyenne, participating in the November 1876 Dull Knife Fight on the side of the United States, along with Shoshone, Cheyenne, Sioux, and Pawnee scouts. Officers of the United States Army supported the idea of an Arapaho reservation in eastern Wyoming Territory ‚Äî General Crook may have promised an agency on the Tongue River. Yet federal policy prevented this from coming to fruition, partly because the United States had essentially stopped negotiating reservation treaties with tribes after 1868, preferring instead to use executive orders in such agreements. In 1878 the U.S. Army saw the onset of winter with roughly 1,000 hungry and impoverished Arapaho still averse to living near the Red Cloud Agency, at an agreed-upon agency of Fort Randall, or in Indian Territory with the Southern Arapaho. Chief Black Coal had previously visited the Southern Arapaho reservation on the Canadian River in Oklahoma, finding the location unacceptable. So, Army officers looked to Fort Washakie as the closest alternate agency for distributing rations, despite the fact that the Shoshone held treaty rights to decide what other tribes they were willing to admit to the reservation under the Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868. The supposedly temporary placement of the Arapaho at Fort Washakie Agency became permanent because the United States government never took further action to relocate the tribe. The Arapaho held out hope for a reservation of their own until 1890, when Gen. Crook died. In late-1800s dealings including land cessions, the government repeatedly acted as if the Arapaho were a party of their reservation and its resources by including them in cession discussions like the sale of the Thermopolis Hot Springs. This was despite Shoshone protests (which were later held up in court) that the Arapaho had no legal claim to the reservation. According to historian Loretta Fowler, Arapaho leaders at the time were aware they had no real legal status to reservation land in the Wind River Valley. They participated in land cessions and allotment of reservation land in part to solidify their title and claims to the land. It wasn't until the conclusion of the 1938 U.S. Supreme Court Case United States v. Shoshone Tribe of Indians that the government recognized it had wrongly given Shoshone land and resources to the Arapaho. A subsequent land deal then officially solidified Arapaho claim as half-owners of tribal lands and resources on the Shoshone Indian Reservation, which was officially renamed the Wind River Indian Reservation. This complicated history of the Arapaho arrival on the reservation continues to affect intertribal relations and politics on the reservation today. Over time, intermarriage between members of the two tribes has occurred, building connections between members of the historically-enemy tribes and encouraging political cooperation. Yet efforts to maintain and exert independent sovereignty of each tribe remain a major dynamic on the reservation. =Mid-20th century to present= In the 1970s and 1980s, oil and gas operators on the Wind River Indian Reservation were found to be stealing oil from the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho. In a coordinated scheme, companies extracted oil and paid some production royalties to tribes, while also secretly collecting and selling a separate supply of oil for which they paid no royalties. The expos√© led to reforms. Of the population in 2011, 3,737 were Shoshone and 8,177 were Arapaho. There were of tribal land with of wilderness area. In 2000, 6,728 (28.9%) were Native Americans (full or part) and of them 54% were Arapaho and 30% Shoshone. Of the Native American population, 22% spoke a language other than English at home. = Land and wildlife conservation = The Wind River Indian Reservation established a roadless area in the Wind River Range in the 1930s, several decades before the passage of the national Wilderness Act of 1964. Greater Sage-Grouse on Wind River Reservation The tribes have re-established populations of big game, such as moose, elk, mule deer, whitetail deer, bighorn sheep and pronghorn antelope, and have passed hunting regulations to conserve these species. In November 2016 the Shoshone introduced ten bison to the reservation, the beginning of what is planned as a 1,000-head herd. They were the first bison to be seen on the Wind River Reservation since 1885. Area suited as buffalo habitat is estimated at on the west side and another on the north of the reservation. The Northern Arapaho established a bison herd in 2019.  Tourism  = Lodging and museums = Facilities for tourism include hotels located at the Wind River Casino and the Shoshone Rose Casino. There are numerous cultural centers and interpretive displays at the Eastern Shoshone Cultural Center and library at Fort Washakie School, as well as the Northern Arapaho Experience Room at the Wind River Hotel and Casino. The Museum of the Rockies in Lander hosts weekly powwow dancing demonstrations during the summer. = Fishing, hiking, mountaineering, and rafting = The Wind River Indian Reservation allows access for fishing and hiking for non- tribal members who purchase a tribal fishing license available from local retailers. The license allows access to fishing lands on the southern half of the reservation, including in the tribal roadless area that encompasses part of the dramatic Wind River Range. Hikers and mountaineers seeking the closest approach to Gannett Peak can hire a guide to drive into a trailhead. The reservation licenses contractors in Thermopolis to offer whitewater rafting and fishing outfitting in the spectacular Wind River Canyon. = Powwows = The Wind River Country, the wide expansion of land on which the Wind River Reservation resides, provides opportunities for visitors to see and participate in important cultural experiences. Scheduled powwows are available to attend by the public. There are three larger celebrations throughout the year in Wind River Country, including the Eastern Shoshone Powwow in June, the Ethete Celebration in July, and the Northern Arapaho Powwow in September. Beginning on Friday nights, these ceremonies are an important aspect of Native American culture, that involve feasting, singing and dancing. Saturday and Sundays also have powwow festivities. An important aspect of the powwow is showcasing the regalia of the dancers. Each piece is personally significant to the dancer, uniquely handmade, utilizing feathers, shells, bones, beadwork and sometimes family heirlooms. The dances performed are traditional dances, unique to the tribe they belong to, as is the music. The spectacle is described on the Wind River Country's tourism website, telling prospective visitors, \\"If you close your eyes for a second the music will sweep you away. Drumming and singing accompanies all dancing and the drumbeat is considered sacred, representing the heartbeat of the tribe. Each thumping note carries songs to the Great Spirit, along with the prayers of the people.\\" The website also advertises the powwows as being free admission. In popular culture *PBS aired the documentary film Chiefs, filmed from 2000-2001 by Daniel Junge, about the members of the successful high school basketball team on the Wind River Reservation. *Margaret Coel has written a series of mystery novels set on the Wind River Reservation featuring Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden and Father John O'Malley, pastor of the fictional St. Francis mission. The actual Roman Catholic mission on the reservation is the Saint Stephen's Indian Mission. *In 2017, the film Wind River was released. Written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, it stars Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Graham Greene and Gil Birmingham. Set in winter, the thriller mystery explores the death of a young Arapaho woman on the reservation and social conditions there. The film shows depictions of sexual assault on reservations. *Facebook produced the film Good Medicine by director Jackson Tisi to show the broad definition of \\"good medicine\\" today on the reservation, ranging from traditional spiritual practices and powwow dancing to skateboarding. Contemporary issues Current social and economic conditions on the Wind River Indian Reservation have complicated historical roots. The reservation has many examples of cultural survival, adaptation, and patriotism. Yet the reservation community also suffers from the legacy of settler colonialism, dispossession from land, forced assimilation and cultural destruction, family disruption, environmental extraction and degradation, disenfranchisement, and inter-generational poverty. Though media portrayals produced by outsiders frequently note these disparities, tribal members have publicly objected to such narratives, noting that they are not the whole story of life in reservation communities. High Country News tribal desk editor Tristan Ahtone (Kiowa) used Wind River media coverage by the New York Times, CNN, and Business Insider as examples of simplistic negative narratives that future journalists can work to disrupt through accurate portrayals of Native American realities, both good and bad. = Crime on the reservation and media portrayals = A decades-long study titled \\"Delinquency Among Wind River Indian Reservation Youth\\" showed that large amounts of the reservation's youth were charged with a variety of crimes. This study shows that from the years 1967-71, 1,047 juvenile cases were examined by the Court of Indian Offenses on the reservation. 693 of the 1,047 cases dealt with delinquency, with 470 of these cases involving a young male defendant. The distribution of juvenile charges showed that 251 of 917 total charges involved alcohol-related crimes (public intoxication, minor in possession, and driving under the influence). In 2009, three young Native American girls (13, 14, and 15 years of age) were murdered on the reservation. They were found in the bedroom of a small home in Beaver Creek, which is a low-income tribal housing community. They had overdosed on methadone, a painkiller which is used to wean heroin addicts off of heroin. However, no one knows how they received the painkillers, which is why the coroner ruled their deaths homicides. The reservation has a very thin police force, which led to the FBI being the lead investigators on the homicide. The reservation has six officers who are responsible for patrolling an area about the size of Rhode Island. Two teenage boys were arrested in connection with the girls' deaths. One boy had given them his grandmother's methadone, saying that the girls were already high and he wanted to help them, because they didn't want to go home and have their parents see them. In the early 21st century, the media reported problems of reservation poverty and unemployment, resulting in associated crime and a high rate of drug abuse. In 2012, The New York Times released an article titled \\"Brutal Crimes Grip an Indian Reservation\\". According to this article, written by Timothy Williams, an Iraq war strategy, \\"the surge\\", was used to attempt to fight crime, taking hundreds of officers from the National Park Service and other federal agencies. This had major success at other reservations, but on the Wind River Indian Reservation, violent crime increased by seven percent. In 2013, Business Insider produced a photo scrapbook and indicated locals refer to different streets by infamously violent American locations such as Compton near Los Angeles. The reservation was experiencing a methamphetamine crisis that has since been significantly reduced, even while addiction continues to be a problem. Other residents say the Wind River Indian Reservation is a more hopeful place than is often portrayed in press reports. = Public health = There are two outpatient clinics located on the reservation. There is one located in Arapahoe, and the second one is located in Fort Washakie. The clinics offer a variety of services such as Behavioral Health, Social Services, Business Office, Community Health Nursing, Purchased/Referred Care (PRC), Dental, Diabetes Program, Laboratory/Radiology, Medical Records, Medical Services, Nursing, Optometry, Office of Environmental Health, Utilization Review and Compliance. The average life expectancy for someone living on the reservation is 49 years. According to A Suicide Epidemic in an American Indian Community, a study done regarding suicide on the reservation in 1985, the months of August and September produced very high suicide numbers. There were 12 reported deaths, and 88 additional verified instances of suicide threats or suicidal attempts. This epidemic among Native American tribes can be attributed to high unemployment and abuse of alcohol. 40 of the attempts were between the ages of 13 and 19, and 24 attempts were between the ages of 20 and 29. Of the 88 attempts, alcohol was involved in 47 cases, with 46 male and 42 females attempting suicide. Many events were created to attempt to stop this suicide epidemic that hit the reservation. Parents and elder community members closed bingo nights for children and hosted recreational activities instead. The schools extended hours for learning centers and gymnasiums. An alcohol treatment program began holding weekly alcohol-free teen dances, which were very popular and had a high attendance. These initiatives were designed to provide a safe and alcohol-free environment for the children and young adults. This ultimately helped quell the epidemic, and prevented suicide attempts across such young age groups. An article published in 2001, The Social Construction of American Indian Drinking: Perceptions of American Indian and White Officials, discovered, by qualitatively interviewing a small sample size of 12 Native Americans residing on the reservation and 12 Whites who also reside on the reservation, that alcoholism is present on the reservation. 10 of 12 Natives said that alcohol is a problem shared by both minors and adults, while all 12 Whites said this. 10 of 12 American Indians said that alcohol is strongly linked to crime, while 11 of 12 Whites agreed. The biggest outlier was that only 8 of 12 American Indians said that alcohol is a very serious problem on the reservation, while 11 of 12 Whites said the same. In an article in the Casper Star-Tribune, of the 79 deaths from 2004, a quarter of the deaths were attributed to alcoholic cirrhosis and half were alcoholic deaths due to car crashes and homicide connected to drugs. According to Cathy Keene, local director for Indian Health Services, the reservation's situation has gotten to the point where the Public Health Service can only fund things that require emergency care. The lack of funding has resulted in fewer surgeries and medical procedures. The Fort Washakie Health Center is only working with slightly more than half of its needed funding, according to Richard Brannan, chief executive officer of the Indian Health Service. A study found that approximately 71% of the population is obese and 12% have diabetes, compared to the national average 36.5% and 9.4%. In 2009, the reservation received a five-year grant in funding from the Merck Foundation's Alliance for Reducing Diabetes Disparities (ARDD) to improve patient care, community clinical system of care, and clinicians. The ultimate goal of the funding is to find an ideal model or solution that can be repeated at other reservations to decrease the rate of diabetes. After receiving funding, the project team gathered other members who shared an interest in preventing and managing diabetes on the reservation. They recruited members of the Wind Reservation Coalition for Diabetes Management and Prevention, Wind River Indian Health Service, Fremont County Public Health, the University of Wyoming's Centsible Nutrition Program, Sundance Research Institute, and the State of Wyoming Department of Health's Diabetes Prevention program. These members helped create focus groups consisting of residents from the reservation to understand the barriers and the issues with health services. The group created a disease management program based on the Chronic Care Model which focused on looking at members with or at risk of diabetes. They created specific exercises and nutrition programs that took account of the lifestyle and culture of the residents. For individuals who were already diagnosed, the program created a self-management education program. After the five-year program, the results showed improved clinical outcomes. 47% of the participants saw a decrease in their HbA1c levels, improved diabetes management with a mean decrease of 1.12 points. Due to the success of the program, a two-year grant from the AstraZeneca Foundation proposed to help 350 reservation residents who are at risk for cardiovascular disease. = Education and employment = Only 60% of Native Americans complete high school, compared to 80% of White students. The Wind River Reservation dropout rate is 40%, more than twice the state average of Wyoming. Teenagers are twice as likely to commit suicide compared to other young adults within Wyoming. There are other issues that commonly occur on the reservation such as child abuse, teenage pregnancy, sexual assault, domestic violence, and alcoholism. There was the death of an eighth grader at Wyoming Indian Middle School who was killed by voluntary manslaughter in April 2010. Wind River's crime rate is five to seven times the national average, and the reservation has a history of gang violence. The reservation has struggled with an alarming percent of unemployment. According to a 2005 Bureau of Indian Affairs report, the Northern Arapaho Tribe's unemployment rate was 73%, and Eastern Shoshone's was 84%. Other reservations have similar or higher rates of unemployment. There does seem to be a consensus on what some of the contributing factors are. One is lack of adequate physical infrastructure‚Äîgood roads and bridges, public water supply and sanitation facilities, and adequate education. The Wyoming Department of Education decided to collaborate with the North Central Comprehensive Center in order to improve the reservation's education system. They conducted multiple listening sessions within classes of different schools within the reservation. After the sessions, parents and students came to the consensus that the Wind River Reservation schools needed more teachers that are Native American. They also advocated for more security in order to lessen bullying and gangs, and more Native American-relevant courses, such as their Native American language. Lastly, students and parents wanted a standard for academic expectations that should be held within all schools within the reservation. One of the parents remarked, \\"My grandson goes to the school in Lander. We won't transfer him back here to the reservation because they're two years behind where my grandson is.\\" Megan Degenfelder, Wyoming Department of Education Policy Advisor, said the inputs from the listening sessions has the department headed in the right track \\"to improve education for Native American students and to best be able to allocate our resources and time.\\" = Environmental = According to Folo Akintan's preliminary data, a medical doctor and epidemiologist from the Rocky Mountain Tribal Epidemiology Center in Billings, Montana, four out of ten Wind River Reservation residents reported that they have had a relative die from cancer. Many of the residents believe it is due to a uranium mill and contamination plume near St. Stephens. In 1958 Susquehanna‚ÄìWestern began processing uranium and vanadium ore on the reservation with sulfuric acid. Although the mill closed in 1963, there were tailings left behind. In 1988 the Department of Energy (DOE) found that soils, surface water and shallow groundwater were all contaminated. The DOE believes the land will naturally flush itself and be contamination-free 100 years from now. In 2010, the DOE recorded levels of contamination 100 times higher than what is allowed by the USEPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for drinking water. Tribal officials were worried about their water sources being contaminated by these deadly toxins. The DOE placed plastic PVC for the water pipeline. They reassured the residents that it was secure and wouldn't break; however, Wind River Environmental Quality Commission officials state that the pipe has broken multiple times within the past year. The residents have become fed up with the DOE due to lack of cleaning up the land, poor pipeline equipment, and lack of spreading data about the high levels of contamination from flooding. Although it's hard to suggest that a uranium tailing site is causing an increased cancer rate, Dr. Akintan suggests, \\"It is a risk indicator.\\" The cancer rates on the reservation are higher than the national and state average. Although Dr. Akintan's reports show an increased cancer rate, the research had many limitations. The first limitation was lack of responses returned. There was a total of 3,000 surveys and only 286 were completed. Also, the data collected was only self-reported data which is unreliable due to response bias from the participants. Also, the results were leading but not statistically significant.  Relationship with Arapahoe High School  In 1993, the Northern Arapaho Tribe on the Wind River Reservation began a relationship with a high school in Centennial, Colorado, to \\"[promote] awareness to the co- existence of two very diverse cultures.\\" Despite previous controversy, Arapahoe High School and the Arapaho Nation established an agreement, in which the tribe endorsed the school mascot, the \\"Arapahoe Warrior\\". The image of the mascot used by the school was drawn by Northern Arapaho artist Wilbur Antelope. The agreement also promised a long-standing relationship between the school and the tribe. Signed September 17, 1993, this proclamation allowed for the \\"Arapahoe Warrior\\" to become a reminder of Elder Anthony Sitting Eagle's words, \\"Always take care of one another,\\" a phrase repeated often by students and faculty at Arapahoe High School. As part of the agreement, Arapahoe High school and the Arapaho Nation alternate visiting each other every year. When the Arapaho tribe comes to visit the school, the daily activities are put on pause for an assembly. Arapahoe High School students accompany those visiting from the Wind River Reservation and file into the large gymnasium, renamed in December 1994 after Arapaho Elder Anthony Sitting Eagle. Two cultures unite for a celebration, the Arapaho tribe performing traditional dances and the tribal leaders speaking to the students. When the students visit the Wind River Reservation, they take a tour of the school and learn more about the Arapaho Nation's culture. This tradition continues today, and the students benefit greatly from it.

Collins English Dictionary. c. 1550 ‚Äì 24 March 1601/1602) of Wherwell Abbey, Hampshire, was a member of Elizabeth I's Privy Council. Biography Thomas West was the eldest son of William West, 1st Baron De La Warr, by his first wife, Elizabeth Strange, the daughter of Thomas Strange of Chesterton, Gloucestershire. He succeeded his father, who had been created Baron De La Warr and died in 1595, by letters patent in 1597. He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight in 1586 and for Aylesbury in 1593. He was knighted in 1587. It is probable, though uncertain, that he had previously represented Chichester in the 1571 Parliament and East Looe in the 1572 Parliament. From 1590 to his death he was one of the two Chamberlains of the Exchequer.

It was formerly classified within the now-obsolete order Lycoperdales, which, following a restructuring of fungal taxonomy brought about by molecular phylogeny, has been split; the puffballs, Calvatia spp. are now placed in the family Agaricaceae of the order Agaricales. Most species in the genus Calvatia are edible when young, though some are best avoided, such as Calvatia fumosa, which has a very pungent odor. The name Calvatia derives from the Latin calvus meaning \\"bald\\" and calvaria, meaning \\"dome of the skull\\". Taxonomy Calvatia was circumscribed by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1849. Fries included a single species in the genus, Calvatia craniiformis, which was originally described as Bovista craniiformis by Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1832.

The village is located at 36¬∞ 57' north and 3¬∞ 13' east, and stands at an altitude of 1,255 metres, on the road from Trev√©lez to Ug√≠jar. The municipality has an area of 12 square km, and its population in 2003 was estimated at 160. Although traditionally agricultural, the area under cultivation in the municipality is now only 35 hectares. However, like Trev√©lez it is known for its air-cured ham. In Moorish times it was a centre of the silk industry. A fortress was established in Juviles in the 8th century, though the origins of the village are probably older. It acquired strategic importance during the Middle Ages, often serving as a refuge for local people in times of civil strife. In 913 it was conquered by Aberram√°n III. From the 12th to the 16th century the village served as the administrative centre of a \\"taha\\" of 12 settlements with 23 smaller hamlets associated with them. Following the 1500 morisco rebellion, Fernando the Catholic destroyed the fortress as a measure against further revolts; its ruins can still be seen. In 1572, as in other Alpujarran areas, the remaining morisco population was replaced by Christians brought from Castile.

Very popular in his own country,Hardy Kr√ºger at Allmovie Kr√ºger is also known for his appearances in international films like Hatari!, The Flight of the Phoenix, The Wild Geese, Sundays and Cybele, A Bridge Too Far, The Battle of Neretva, The Secret of Santa Vittoria, The Red Tent, The One That Got Away and Barry Lyndon. Early life  Hardy Kr√ºger was born in Wedding, Berlin in 1928. Kr√ºger's parents were ardent Nazis and he stated in a 2016 interview that he was \\"raised to love Hitler\\".Interview with Hardy Kr√ºger (2016) From 1941, he went to an elite Adolf Hitler School at the Ordensburg Sonthofen. At age 15, Hardy made his film d√©but in a German picture, Alfred Weidenmann's The Young Eagles, but his acting career was interrupted when he was conscripted into the German Wehrmacht in 1944 at age 16. In March 1945, Kr√ºger was conscripted into the 38th SS Division Nibelungen where he was drawn into heavy fighting. The 16-year-old Kr√ºger was ordered to eliminate a group of American soldiers. When he refused, he was sentenced to death for cowardice, but another SS officer stopped the order.Hardy Kruger at Goretro Kr√ºger described this experience as his break with Nazism. He afterwards served as a messenger for the SS, but later escaped and hid out in Tyrol until the end of the war.Biography of Hardy Kruger at his homepage He is today a member of the Amadeu Antonio Foundation and frequently speaks out against extremism and for democracy, also citing his own experiences.Hardy Kruger at the Amadeo Antonio Foundation's homepage  Life and work  Hardy Kr√ºger during a lecture (2009) Kr√ºger continued his acting career after the Second World War with small stage roles because he could not afford an acting school. He established himself as a German film star during the 1950s. He appeared in the German version of The Moon Is Blue (1953), directed by Otto Preminger. Kr√ºger looked for international roles, because he found the German Heimatfilm cinema of the 1950s rather shallow.Article in the SZ about his 90th Birthday He first came to the attention of English language audiences in the 1957 British war film The One That Got Away, the story of Franz von Werra, the only German prisoner of war to successfully escape from Allied custody and return to Germany. In 1960, Kr√ºger bought Ngorongoro farm in the then Tanganyika Territory, which he owned for 13 years. Ngorongoro and the area around it served as the setting for the 1962 film Hatari!, a Howard Hawks film, in which Kr√ºger appeared with John Wayne.Article at Hatari Lodge Fluent in German, English and French, he has worked in numerous European and American films, including the Oscar- winning Sundays and Cybele (1962), and the original 1965 version of The Flight of the Phoenix (1965). Other films include the comedy-drama The Secret of Santa Vittoria (1969), where he played a German officer during the Second World War trying to find hidden wine in a small Italian town; Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon with Ryan O'Neal (1975); Richard Attenborough's A Bridge Too Far (sharing a scene with Laurence Olivier, 1977); and The Wild Geese with Richard Burton (1978). Because of his stereotypical Teutonic look (blond hair and blue eyes), Kr√ºger often performed in roles portraying German soldiers.Hardy Kruger at Allmovie Kr√ºger and his wife Anita in 2013 Kr√ºger mostly retired from acting in the late 1980s and is today a writer. He published 16 books since 1970, of which four of his works have been translated into English.Hardy Kruger Homepage He also directed a number of European television documentaries,Hardy Kruger at Allmovie showing him travelling around the world.  Personal life  Kr√ºger had his first child Christiane Kr√ºger (born 1945) with his later-to-be wife Renate Densow (1918-2006) when he was only 17 years old. Kr√ºger and Densow were married between 1950 and 1964. His second marriage was with the Italian painter Francesca Marazzi between 1964 and 1977. From this marriage, he has the children Malaika Kr√ºger (born 1967) and Hardy Kr√ºger Jr. (born 1968). Kr√ºger married his third wife Anita Park in 1978. They live in California and Hamburg today.Interview with Hardy Kr√ºger (2016) In the 1960s and 1970s, Kr√ºger lived at the ranch \\"Hatari Lodge\\" (where the movie Hatari! was filmed) at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.

School arms The school coat of arms is composed of the cross of Saint Alban together with the School motto. The cross of Saint Alban is a gold saltire (a cross, signifying that Alban was martyred, but diagonal, as he was beheaded, not crucified) on a blue field (or, in heraldic terms, Azure, a saltire Or). The current school motto is Non nobis nati (\\"Born not for ourselves\\"). This dates back to the family of the 12th century Geoffrey de Gorham (Master and subsequently Abbot of St Albans), deriving from Cicero's (\\"Non nobis solum nati sumus\\"; \\"We are not born for ourselves alone\\"), and was used until the Reformation. It was re-introduced in 1994, thereby stressing the link between the School before and after the dissolution of the monastery in 1539. Non nobis nati replaced the previous motto Mediocria firma (\\"The middle road is best\\"), used between the 16th and 20th centuries. This was the motto of the Bacon family at Gorhambury (including Sir Nicholas and Sir Francis Bacon). This formed part of the Bacon coat of arms, which for instance can still be seen outside the Verulam Arms public house in nearby Welclose Street and inside St Mary's Church, Redbourn.

In 1549, to put the school on a firmer foundation, the last Abbot was granted the right to maintain a Grammar School by a private Act of Parliament. Around 1545, the school outgrew its St Peter's church premises and moved again to the Lady Chapel at the east end of the Abbey, bought for the huge sum of ¬£100, and it was separated from the rest of the abbey with a wall made of smashed stones from the ancient shrine of St Alban. In 1553 the Crown sold the rest of the Abbey Church to the town for ¬£400 (the value of the lead on its roof) and became a Church of England parish church for the new Borough of St Albans. In 1570 Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and father of Sir Francis Bacon, then living at nearby Gorhambury, gave the school new statutes and re-endowed the School by successful petitioning Queen Elizabeth I for a Wine Charter (extended by King James I in 1606).

Between 1907 and 1976, it was a Direct Grant grammar school, keeping the name St Albans School for most part not least because of the existence of 2 separate Boys' and Girls' Grammar Schools in St Albans and was generally referred to simply as a Direct Grant School. In the 1960s and 1970s many of the pupils at the school enjoyed a free education, paid for by public funds. From 1980 to 2005, it also offered free places to poor but academically talented pupils under the Assisted Places Scheme. Since the 1970s, the school has also offered a large number of scholarships and bursaries up to 100% of the school's fees, funded from its endowments. Since the 19th century, there have been many additions to the school site, which now comprises a very interesting architectural mixture of buildings dating from the Roman-era cellar, where the archives are kept under the Abbey Gateway, to modern extensions built in the 1990s.Hertfordshire HER & St Albans UAD. heritagegateway.org.uk The school also includes the oldest room in the world regularly used as a classroom, the 12th century West Gate Room, which was incorporated from a previous gateway into the current Abbey Gateway in the 1360s.

Religion and musical education The school still maintains links with St Albans Cathedral, which doubles as the school's chapel. Services are held there every Monday and Friday morning during term time, and special events held there include the annual Founders' Day and two carol services, led by the school choir, who still wear black and blue gowns in the same style as worn by undergraduates at Trinity College, Cambridge and similar to those worn by monks at the Abbey in medieval times. In addition, the school's music staff are usually linked with the Abbey's musical staff. Andrew Parnell, organist and harpsichordist, was assistant master of music at the Abbey as well as being master of music and choirmaster at the school from 1976 to 2001.

In medieval times, the school and one of its alumni, Matthew Paris, were closely associated with the St Albans school of medieval historiography, and developed one of the first consistent methods of historical writing.A. Gransden, \\"Historical Writing in England: c. 500 to c. 1307\\" (1996) pp. 355‚Äì360 More recently; two teachers in the award- winning Ancient History department published a book on Roman sources in 2010. Some notable historians who are alumni of the school include Colin Renfrew, an archaeological historian and former Disney Professor of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, Ernest Gellner, an anthropological historian, Professor Malcolm Schofield of St John's College, Cambridge, and more recently Justin Pollard, a TV historian, and Peter Sarris, a specialist on the Byzantine Empire and a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. The school today St Albans School is predominantly a single-sex school for boys, but has accepted girls into the Sixth Form since 1991. It is a member of the Headmasters' Conference of leading public schools. In its earlier days it was known as the Free School of St Albans, City of St Alban Grammar School or St Albans Grammar School. It is often (erroneously) referred to as \\"The Boys' School\\", \\"St Albans Boys\\" and \\"The Abbey School\\" (thereby causing confusion with The Abbey C of E Primary School nearby which is almost always referred to as \\"The Abbey School\\", and the adjacent but now defunct Abbey National Boys' School, a name which is still borne by a building in nearby Spicer Street). The school now has 814 pupils. The school operates a house system. The current system, which came into use in September 1996, assigns all members of the school to one of four houses. These are named after notable former pupils and staff: Hawking, Renfrew, Hampson and Marsh. Previously the house names were Abbey, Breakespeare, Debenham, Pemberton, Shirley, Woollams and School House. School House, the last remaining boarding house, closed at the end of the Summer Term 1961 and those boys in School House were integrated into other houses. In 1967 the School acquired what was then a derelict hill farm in the Brecon Beacons. The property, Pen Arthur, was fully restored and is now a well-equipped Field Studies Centre. Academic departments use Pen Arthur for field trips and study weekends throughout the year, and it plays a key part as a base for outdoor activities organised by the CCF and Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme. During their first year at the school, all pupils go to Pen Arthur for a week, during which time they participate in many \\"outward-bound\\" activities such as caving, hiking and even visiting a Roman gold mine.

It was written by Allen and Ken Hughes, directed by Hughes, and co-produced by Irving Allen, Albert R. Broccoli and Harold Huth. The screenplay was by Ken Hughes and Montgomery Hyde, based on the play The Stringed Lute by John Furnell. The film was made by Warwick Films and released by United Artists. It stars Peter Finch as Wilde, Lionel Jeffries as Queensberry, and John Fraser as Bosie (Lord Alfred Douglas) with James Mason, Nigel Patrick, Yvonne Mitchell, Maxine Audley, Paul Rogers and James Booth.

It was one of two films about Wilde released in 1960, the other being Oscar Wilde. According to production designer Ken Adam, producer Irving Allen set up four editing rooms for the production, working in parallel during principal photography; the setup permitted the film on the screen in the West End seven weeks after they had started filming.A Kubrick Masterclass with Sir Ken Adam, Hosted by Sir Christopher Frayling , from The Script Factory Release The film was released at the same time as Oscar Wilde starring Robert Morley. Producers of both films originally refused to change their movie titles. Eventually, after confusion at various cinemas, Warwick announced they would release The Trials of Oscar Wilde as The Green Carnation. Reception =Critical= In his review of the film, Bosley Crowther wrote: \\"Mr. Wilde himself could not have expected his rare personality or his unfortunate encounters with British justice on a morals charge to have been more sympathetically or affectingly dramatized. In comparison to that other British picture about the same subject that opened [in New York City] last week, this one is more impressive in every respect, save one.\\"Wilde Absolved: Writer's 'Trials' Get New Examination, a 28 June 1960 review from The New York Times Crowther concludes the review saying \\"The only thing is you wonder if this is a fairly true account, if Mr. Wilde was as noble and heroic as he is made to appear. And if he was, what was he doing with those cheap and shady young men? It looks to us as if they are trying to whitewash a most unpleasant case, which is one of the more notorious and less ennobling in literary history.\\" Variety magazine, commenting on the performances, said \\"Peter Finch gives a moving and subtle performance as the ill-starred playwright. Before his downfall he gives the man the charm that he undoubtedly had....John Fraser as handsome young Lord Alfred Douglas is suitably vain, selfish, vindictive and petulant and the relationship between the two is more understandable. Where Trials suffers in comparison with the B&W; film is in the remarkable impact of the libel case court sequence. James Mason never provides the strength and bitter logic necessary for the dramatic cut-and-thrust when Wilde is in the witness box.\\"The Trials of Oscar Wilde, a 1960 review by Variety magazine Awards The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film. Peter Finch won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the film also received four other BAFTA nominations including Best British Film, Best Film from any source and for John Fraser as Best British Actor.

Stone Nation, or BPSN, is an American street gang founded in Chicago, estimated to have more than 100,000 members. The gang was originally formed in the late 1950s as the Blackstone Rangers. The organization was co-founded by Eugene Hairston and Jeff Fort. In later years, under Fort's leadership, an Islamic faction of the gang emerged, naming themselves the \\"El Rukn tribe of the Moorish Science Temple of America\\" (or simply El Rukn, Arabic for \\"the pillar\\" or \\"the foundation\\"). They eventually started describing themselves as Orthodox Sunni Muslims. Jeff Fort changed their fort name from El Rukn Moorish Science Mosque, to El Rukn Sunni Masjid al-Malik. Background Considered by law enforcement authorities to be Chicago's most powerful and sophisticated street gang, the BPSN finances itself through a wide array of criminal activities and is part of the large Chicago gang alliance known as the People Nation.Kenneth O'Reilly, Racial Matters: The FBI's File on Black America, 1960 - 1972 (New York: Free Press, 1991), p. 409. Under Fort's command, the BPSN assumed an increasingly revolutionary outlook as it became associated with the black nationalism movement, eventually attracting the attention of the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who introduced them to Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi and Nicaragua's Sandinistas. In 1986, four of its members were indicted for conspiring to commit terrorist acts in the United States for the Libyan Government. The verdict marked the first time American citizens had been found guilty of planning terrorist acts for a foreign government in return for money. The BPSN originated, and is based, on the South Side of Chicago in the Woodlawn neighborhood.Lance Williams, \\"The Black Pyramid Stone: Black Power, Politics, and Gangbanging,\\" University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, February 12, 2001. It has expanded into other areas. History The Blackstone Rangers were founded at the St. Charles Institution for Troubled Youth by Jeff Fort and Eugene Hairston as a community organization for black youth in the Woodlawn area of South Chicago. Between 1961 and 1963, they evolved into one of the most dangerous and powerful gangs in Chicago. Fort seized upon the gang's changed mission, renaming it the Black P.(Peace) Stone Nation. He transformed the BPSN into a black nationalistic group, and continued to involve the gang in street crime and drug trafficking. BPSN co- founder Eugene Hairston was incarcerated on drug charges in June 1966 and was eventually murdered in 1988. Fort was arrested for mismanagement of government grants totaling $927,000 from the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity in March 1972. Fort was released in 1976, but was later re-incarcerated on drug charges in the early 1980s. At the same time he was released from prison, Fort converted to Islam and imbued the BPSN with Islamic overtones, and adopted the name Abdul Malik Ka'bah. According to former gang member Lance Williams, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was responsible for introducing Fort to Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi. Following meetings during 1986 with Libyan operatives from Colonel Gaddafi's government, Fort was arrested. In 1987, Fort was tried and convicted for conspiring with Libya to perform acts of domestic terrorism. He was sentenced to 80 years imprisonment and transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Marion (the federal supermax prison) in Marion, Illinois.\\"Five Draw Long Sentences for Terrorism Scheme\\".

It serves both, as the main thoroughfare for Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, and a spur of the Foothills Parkway. Route description Most of the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway is a divided highway, except for the segment south of Gatlinburg, which carries little traffic. Most of the parkway has been widened to six lanes, and is one of the most congested arterial routes in the state. The road is simply called \\"Parkway\\" in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, where most of the commercial land development has occurred in those two cities. Both have numbered each traffic light sequentially to make it easier for non-locals to find their hotels and other tourist attractions. Sevierville has its traffic lights numbered in miles and tenths, according to the mileage from the national park boundary. The Great Smoky Mountains Parkway begins as a segment of US 441 at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park a few miles south of Gatlinburg. Entering Gatlinburg, the route widens to four lanes as an undivided arterial route. In downtown Gatlinburg, the route turns north at an intersection with US 321, beginning a wrong-way concurrency with that route. Leaving Gatlinburg, the parkway becomes part of the Foothills Parkway as its spur route, although that roadway has yet to be built in the area (the right of way for it already includes land for a small interchange adjacent to the southern end of the Pigeon Forge city limit). This segment, on a narrow strip of National Park Service (NPS) land, is a four-lane divided highway which runs along both banks of the northward-flowing Little Pigeon River. Where the river briefly diverts to the west and back east again, the southbound roadway on the west bank also curves around, while the northbound lanes go through a tunnel. The Gatlinburg visitor center is located just before entering the town from the north. The Gatlinburg Bypass, part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, connects with the parkway to provide a direct access to the National Park. All of these parkways are operated as part of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (unlike other separate national parkways), with support for design and road construction (including repaving) from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) through the Public Lands Transportation Program (PLTP) as in other national parks. Entering Pigeon Forge, the NPS corridor ends and the route widens to six lanes. A short distance later is an intersection with SR 448, which serves as an alternative route to the parkway between Pigeon Forge and Sevierville. A short distance beyond this point, US 321 splits off to the east, heading towards Maryville. Upon entering Sevierville, the parkway splits into an east and west branch, which together encircle the business district of Sevierville, as well as a spur in both directions along U.S. 411. Northbound traffic is directed along the east branch, which contains three northbound lanes and one southbound lane, and southbound traffic along the west branch, which contains three southbound lanes and one northbound lane. In this split section, both north and southbound lanes intersect with US 411, where US 441 splits of into a concurrency with US 411 to the east. At this intersection, the parkway becomes part of SR 66, and is known as Winfield Dunn parkway. The parkway continues north for several more miles through a less-developed area, before reaching an intersection with SR 139. A few miles later, the parkway reaches its northern terminus at the Exit 407 diverging diamond interchange with Interstate 40. =Christmas displays= Within the towns, the road is decorated with Christmas lights all winter. As a six-lane divided highway through Pigeon Forge, very tall multi-fixture street lights in the median are decorated with white LED snowflakes that \\"fall\\" down the poles. In Gatlinburg, white LED deciduous trees sprout from the lampposts, in addition to other displays, such as the large one that stretches across the road at the town's northern entrance. In Sevierville, the traditional and much brighter snowflake light sculptures are still in use. History The northernmost segment of the parkway between Sevierville and I-40 was widened from four to six lanes in three phases with funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Phase 1, between Nichols Street and SR 338, began on July 15, 2009 and was completed on November 18, 2011 at a cost of $38.6 million. Phase 2, between SR 139 and I-40, began in September 2010 and was completed in November 2012 at a cost of $23.3 million. Phase 3, between SR 338 and SR 139 began in March 2012, and was expected to be completed by October 31, 2014. This project was delayed to Dexember 2015 and cost $32.5 million. The interchange with I-40 was reconstructed into a diverging diamond interchange between March 12, 2014 and June 30, 2015.

He is considered one of the Confederacy's best tactical cavalry commanders. Early life Wharton was born near Nashville, Tennessee, as the only child of Sarah Groce Wharton and William H. Wharton, later a leading politician during the Texas Revolution. He was named after his uncle, John Austin Wharton. When he was still an infant, the family moved to what became Brazoria County, Texas. In 1846, Wharton enrolled at South Carolina College where he was a member of the Euphradian Society. Two years later, he married Eliza Penelope Johnson, the daughter of David Johnson, the Governor of South Carolina. After graduating in 1850, Wharton returned to Texas and studied law, establishing his practice in Brazoria. He became a wealthy plantation owner and slave holder. In 1860, he supported John C. Breckinridge's candidacy for the Presidency and served as an elector. Civil War An ardent secessionist, Wharton enlisted in the Confederate Army as captain of Company B, 8th Texas Cavalry, also known as \\"Terry's Texas Rangers.\\" Commissioned as colonel of the regiment, Wharton fought with distinction at the Battle of Shiloh, where he was wounded. Wharton served under Gen. Braxton Bragg during the 1862 invasion of eastern Kentucky. He was promoted to brigadier general on November 18, 1862, and was again wounded, this time at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Wharton monument at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas Wharton again distinguished himself at Chickamauga and was promoted to the rank of major general.

George Wythe Baylor (1832‚Äì1916) (brother of Confederate Arizona Governor Colonel John Baylor) killed Wharton in Houston, over a simmering dispute on military matters. The incident began with an argument on the street outside of the Fannin Hotel, the headquarters of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder. The two officers had quarreled in the past, but this time Wharton came into Magruder's quarters and, as Baylor later claimed, called Baylor a liar. Baylor shot the unarmed Wharton and killed him instantly.Bailey, p. 123. Wharton is interred at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

It is part of the Florida College System and one of the institutions in the system designated a \\"state college,\\" as it offers a greater number of four- year bachelor's degrees than traditional two-year community colleges focused on associate degrees. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and enrolled about 29,000 students in the fall of 2018. The school was founded in 1927 as a private junior college, the first in Florida. It later became a public institution and grew to include campuses throughout Pinellas County. Today it has eleven campuses and centers: four in St. Petersburg, Florida and seven in Seminole, Pinellas Park, Largo, Clearwater, and Tarpon Springs.  History  St. Petersburg College Downtown Center SPC Clearwater Campus sign SPC Clearwater Campus Library East Branch SPC Clearwater Campus ES (Ethics and Social Sciences) building St. Petersburg College was founded in 1927 as St. Petersburg Junior College by Captain George M. Lynch, Pinellas County's city superintendent of schools for the city of St. Petersburg, as a private, non-profit institution.SPC: Just the Facts It was created in part because of the economic downturn preceding the Great Depression as a way for local students to receive a postsecondary education without having to relocate or pay high tuition. On opening day, the college consisted of 102 students and 14 faculty members, operating from an unused wing of St. Petersburg High School. After one semester, SPJC moved its operations to a former high school facility overlooking Mirror Lake, where it remained until January 1942. At this point, the facility was moved into a single building on the corner of 5th Ave. N. and 66th St. N.‚Äîa building still in active use today as the James E. Hendry Administration Building, part of the St. Petersburg/Gibbs Campus. SPJC became a public college in 1948.History of St. Petersburg College, p. 4. After a 1959 study clearly illustrated the demand for a higher-education facility in northern Pinellas county, SPJC began planning the development of a second campus located in Clearwater, Florida. In 1962, the college acquired of land in the vicinity of Drew Street and County Road 32 (Old Coachman Road), land which previously contained an orange grove and a waste disposal site. Construction began on February 25, 1964. That same year, the new campus, consisting of only five buildings, was officially dedicated on November 21.An Informal History of the Clearwater Campus Like almost all other Florida colleges, SPJC was all-white until the mid-1960s. A companion junior college for black students, Gibbs Junior College, opened its doors in 1957. Gibbs was placed under the supervision of SPJC in 1965, and became the Gibbs campus of SPJC. In 1966-67 the name was changed to the Skyway Campus of SPJC. It ceased operations in 1967.Walter L. Smith, The Magnificent Twelve: Florida's Black Junior Colleges, Winter Park, Florida, FOUR-G Publishers, 1994, , pp. 47-48. The only association of today's (2016) Gibbs Campus of SPC with the former Gibbs Junior College is nominal; it is not located where the college was.  Campuses  St. Petersburg College has no resident students. This is mostly because no single campus is large enough to warrant a need for student on-campus housing. Many of the SPC campuses do not offer a large curriculum of available courses, but instead specialize in one or two specific fields. For example, the Caruth Health Education Center in Pinellas Park specializes in courses centering on health care, while the Seminole campus is a highly technology-oriented campus. The Seminole campus also serves to house SPC's University Partnership Center, a campus that offers select degree programs from 16 fully accredited institutions, including Barry University, Case Western Reserve University's Francis Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Cleveland State University, Eckerd College, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida Gulf Coast University, Florida Institute of Technology, Florida International University, Florida State University, Indiana University, Saint Leo University, University of Central Florida, University of West Florida, University of Florida, and University of South Florida.University Partnership Center: Partnering Institutions In total, SPC's University Partnership program offers 60 bachelor's degrees and 39 graduate degrees.University Partnership Center: Degrees Both the Student Services building on the St Petersburg/Gibbs Campus and the Natural Science, Mathematics and College of Education Building on the Clearwater Campus were both recently awarded LEED Gold Certification. The two buildings mark the first LEED Gold higher education buildings in Pinellas County.  Libraries  St. Petersburg College has eight campus libraries, as well as an extensive online library. The eight campus libraries include the Allstate Center Library, Clearwater Campus Library, SPC Downtown Library, SPC Midtown Library, West St. Petersburg Community Library at St. Petersburg Gibbs Campus, Health Education Center Library, Seminole Community Library at Seminole Campus, and the Tarpon Springs Campus Library. The St. Petersburg/Gibbs, Clearwater, and Seminole campus libraries are joint-use libraries, giving users the benefits of a public library and a college library in one. The collections include print and electronic books, academic journals, magazines and newspapers, thousands of online research databases, streaming videos, audiobooks, images, citation tools, music, and periodicals. Study areas, computer labs, and printing services are also available. In addition to on site reference librarians, students can use digital reference services such as AskALibrarian, where they can chat, email or text with an SPC librarian.St. Petersburg College Libraries and Services Athletics The St. Petersburg College athletic teams go by the name \\"Titans.\\" They are a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and compete in the Suncoast Conference of the Florida State College Activities Association (FSCAA). The Titans are represented by a men's basketball and baseball team, as well as a women's volleyball, basketball, tennis, and softball team. The college also has a cheerleading squad who cheers for the men's and women's basketball teams. Cheerleading is also present at pep rallies and other school functions. The Titans softball team appeared in the first Women's College World Series in 1969.

He has been characterized as ‚ÄúBismarck's Boswell.‚Äù Biography Busch was born at Dresden. He entered the University of Leipzig in 1841 as a student of philosophy and theology, and graduated as doctor philosophiae. From 1847, he devoted himself entirely to journalism and literature. He began literary life as a translator of Dickens, Thackeray, and other English authors. In 1851 he went to America, but soon returned disillusioned to Germany, and published an account of his travels. During the next years he travelled extensively in the East and wrote books on Egypt, Greece and Palestine. From 1856 he was employed at Leipzig on the Grenzboten, one of the most influential German periodicals, which, under the editorship of Gustav Freytag, had become the organ of the National Liberal Party. In this role, Busch strongly supported Bismarck's policies. In 1864 he became closely connected with the Augustenburg party in Schleswig-Holstein, but after 1866 he transferred his services to the Prussian government, and was employed in a semi-official capacity in the newly conquered province of Hanover. His work on the Grenzboten had attracted Bismarck's attention, and in 1870 he received an appointment to the German Foreign Office, where he functioned as one of Bismarck's press agents. From that time and for many years, he was the inseparable companion and confidant of the chancellor, taking daily notes of his sayings and doings, and earning for himself the title of ‚ÄúBismarck's Boswell.‚Äù He was at the chancellor's side during the whole of the campaign of 1870‚Äì71. Busch died at Leipzig on 16 November 1899. Works After his trip to the United States, he published: * Wanderungen zwischen Hudson und Mississippi (1853) * Die Mormonen (1857), a book critical of Mormonism In 1878 he published the first of his works on Bismarck, a book entitled Bismarck und seine Leute, w√§hrend des Krieges mit Frankreich (Bismarck and his People during the War with France\\"), in which, under the form of extracts from his diary, he gave an account of the chancellor's life during the war. The vividness of the descriptions and the cleverness with which the conversations were reported ensured a success, and the work was translated into several languages. This was followed in 1884 by another book, Unser Reichskanzler (translated into English as \\"Our Chancellor\\"), chiefly dealing with the work in the foreign office in Berlin. Immediately after Bismarck's death, Busch published the chancellor's famous petition to the emperor Wilhelm II of Germany dated 18 March 1890, requesting to be relieved of office. This was followed by a pamphlet Bismarck und sein Werk; and in 1898 in London and in English, by the famous memoirs entitled Bismarck: some Secret Pages of his History (German by Grunow, under title Tagebuchbl√§tter), in which were reprinted the whole of the earlier works, but which contains in addition a considerable amount of new material, passages from the earlier works which had been omitted because of the attacks they contained on people in high position, records of later conversations, and some important letters and documents which had been entrusted to him by Bismarck. Many passages were of such a nature that it could not be safely published in Germany; but in 1899 a far better and more complete German edition was published at Leipzig in three volumes and consisting of three sections.

She took part in the Battle of Heligoland on 9 May 1864, and is preserved as a museum ship in Denmark.  Design  She was built for the Royal Danish Navy in 1860 as a screw-driven warship with a wooden hull. The figurehead was performed by the sculptor Julius Magnus Petersen and represents the region of Jutland in the form of the shepherd's rod and the fishing net.  History  During the Second War of Schleswig in 1864, she participated in the naval action against the Austrian- Prussian fleet in the Battle of Heligoland on 9 May 1864. Jylland along with Niels Juel and Heimdall bested two Austrian frigates and three small Prussian gunboats, but was unable to maintain the blockade of the Prussian North Sea ports. Jylland sustained considerable damage during the battle. In the 1890s she was reduced to stationary use and barely escaped scrapping in 1908. She served as a barracks and training ship between 1892 and 1908. It was, however, decided to preserve her and she was towed to Ebeltoft in 1960. The hulked frigate further deteriorated until she was placed in dry dock in 1984. Restoration proved to be a major task; over 60% of the timber had to be replaced in addition to the rigging, armament, engines and loose gear. In Danish, she is known as simply Fregatten Jylland, although several ships have used this name. The restoration efforts were completed in 1994 and she is on permanent display in dry dock at the town of Ebeltoft, Denmark. A commemorative coin was issued by the National Bank of Denmark.

With a team consisting of her Personal Appearance Manager, choreographer Luis Villabon, Sound engineer Henry \\"Butch\\" Jackson, and AMS Services for lighting and effects, the track show evolved into a portable production show, fitting both smaller and larger venues. Her costumes included those from designer Gianni Versace and Marc Baur. In collaboration with dancer and choreographer, Luis Villabon, Cooper and manager Scott Sherman, a retired professional dancer himself, purposely cast experienced, Broadway trained dancers, rather than the customary hip hop dancers. By combining classically trained Jazz, Ballet and \\"show\\" dancers, with \\"street\\" and hip hop movement, and adding professional staging and meticulous choreography, her new look and style was established.

The result is a water-soluble material that releases free iodine when in solution. Iodophors are prepared by mixing iodine with the solubilizing agent; heat can be used to speed up the reaction. Commercial use Diluted iodophor is often used by brewers and winemakers to sanitize equipment and bottles. Its major advantage over other sanitizers is that when used in proper proportions, it does not require rinsing. However, it can leave unattractive orange-brown stains on plastic parts and equipment if left in contact with them.

The United States Navy-Marine Corps program closed in 2015. The program is a civilian auxiliary consisting primarily of licensed amateur radio operators who are interested in assisting the military with communications on a regional and national level when access to traditional forms of communication may no longer be available. The MARS programs also include active duty, reserve, and National Guard units; and Navy, Marine Corps units. MARS has a long history of providing worldwide auxiliary emergency communications during times of need. The combined two-service MARS programs (Army, and Air Force), volunteer force of over 3,000 dedicated and skilled amateur radio operators provide the backbone of the MARS program. The main benefit of MARS membership is enjoying the amateur radio hobby through an ever-expanding horizon of MARS service to the nation. MARS members work by the slogans \\"Proudly Serving Those Who Serve\\" and \\"Proud, Professional, and Ready.\\" History QSL card sent by US Navy MARS station NSS for a cross-band radio contact with W2LV on Armed Forces Day 1969 The organization that led to the Military Auxiliary Radio System was called the Auxiliary Amateur Radio System (AARS). AARS was created in November 1925 by a few dedicated pioneers in the United States Army Signal Corps led by Captain Thomas C. Rives. The United States recognized radio as a critical mode of communication during World War I. The integration of radio to support Army operations generated a significant manpower and skill requirement that was not easily met. The Army Amateur Radio System was formed in 1925 to provide a pool of trained radio operators to augment the Signal Corps during mobilization in time of war and provide an extension of the Signal Corps' radio network to support civil authority with natural disaster relief efforts. While supporting military goals, the organization was composed of volunteer civilians who were accomplished radio amateurs. These civilians applied their specialty skills in radio communication while supporting the Signal Corps across the continental United States, the Philippines, Panama, and Hawaii.http://cgsc.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p4013coll3/id/2634 The organization ultimately experienced both success and failure. The Army Amateur Radio System succeeded in developing the proficiency of its radio operators as demonstrated by the support provided to local, state, and federal authorities during natural disaster relief efforts. However, on the eve of the United States' entry into World War II, the Army Amateur Radio System's membership was significantly underdeveloped in numbers to provide significant manpower to augment the Signal Corps' mobilization for war.http://cgsc.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p4013coll3/id/2634 The AARS organization continued to operate until the United States entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, at which time radio amateurs were denied the use of the airwaves, and the amateur service and the Army Amateur Radio System were deactivated. Following WWII, the US Army recognized the importance of reactivating the AARS to train vitally needed communications personnel at a relatively low direct cost to the government, and in 1946 the AARS was reactivated. MARS Operator at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, 1983. The AARS functioned as such until the creation of the Military Affiliate Radio System in November 1948 with the establishment of separate Army and Air Force MARS programs, reflecting the creation of the Air Force as a separate service. In 1948 Captain Robert L. Gabardy (K4TJhttps://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=248930, SK) selected the use of the acronym MARS, the Roman god of war, as a fitting name for the post-World War II rebirth of the AARS as the Military Amateur Radio System.http://cgsc.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p4013coll3/id/2634 The program's name was changed to the Military Affiliate Radio System on 2 September 1952, in recognition of the organization's changing nature with the growing number of civilian volunteer members. Eventually, the Navy-Marine Corps MARS program was established officially on 17 August 1962, and began operations on 1 January 1963. This followed the Cuban Missile Crisis and President Kennedy's concern for viable and extended communications capabilities. During the Korean War, Vietnam War, Cold War and Gulf War, MARS was most known for its handling of \\"Marsgram\\" written messages and providing \\"phone patches\\" to allow overseas servicemen to contact their families at home. The program's name was changed again to the current Military Auxiliary Radio System on 23 December 2009. A dispatch issued in May 2009 announced the shutdown of the Navy and Marine Corps MARS program by September 30, 2009. However, Navy-Marine Corps MARS continued to function until September 30, 2015. Department of Defense Instruction 4650.02, dated 23 December 2009 changed the status of MARS from an affiliate to an auxiliary (equal in status to the Coast Guard Auxiliary and Civil Air Patrol). This change in status saved the Navy-Marine Corps MARS program from being shut down and put it back in line with the Emergency Communications mission of its sister services (Army and Air Force MARS). QSL card from MARS station AEM1NEB Missions Military Auxiliary Radio System provides Department of Defense sponsored emergency communications on a local, national, and international basis. MARS also provides auxiliary communications for military entities only. One major mission that MARS has had for many years is to handle morale, welfare, and official record and voice communications traffic for Armed Forces and authorized U.S. Government civilian personnel stationed throughout the world. MARS establishes programs to create civilian interest, recruit qualified volunteers, and furnish training in military communications, techniques, and procedures. Every year, MARS conducts an appropriate military and amateur radio cross-band exercise as an integral part of the annual Armed Forces Day. They provide a reserve of personnel trained in military radio communications, techniques, and procedures as well as to initiate efforts to improve radio- operating techniques. MARS members test state-of-the-art technology through experimentation and testing. Armed Forces Day Crossband Test Navy-Marine Corps MARS station, NAV-4, operating on Armed Forces Day MARS celebrates Armed Forces Day annually with a traditional military to amateur crossband communications test and a message-receiving test. These tests give amateur radio operators and shortwave listeners an opportunity to demonstrate their individual technical skills and receive recognition from the Secretary of Defense or the appropriate military radio station for their proven expertise. A QSL card is provided to those making contact with one of the military stations. Special commemorative certificates are awarded to anyone who receives and accurately copies the digital Armed Forces Day message from the Secretary of Defense. Participating military stations transmit on selected military MARS frequencies and listen for amateur radio stations in the amateur bands. The military station operator will announce the specific amateur-band frequency being monitored. Usually, the military MARS stations are at places such as The Pentagon,k4af.org Fort Huachuca, Andrews Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base, and various Navy and Coast Guard locations. MARS Today U.S. Army Reserve in the MARS Emergency Communications Unit trailer. The Military Auxiliary Radio System continues to be active today. Its primary mission is to provide contingency communications to the Department of Defense and Military Services. When tasked, MARS may provide communications for Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) such as FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. On a day-to-day basis MARS members are available to handle messages to and from service men and women: active duty, reserve, guard, or retired and certain employees of the federal government who are stationed outside the US. Morale and welfare messages are no longer the largest activity in MARS due to the increased use of the Internet and e-mail by deployed military personnel. MARS had an increased role in providing interoperability communications between Army National Guard and Air National Guard forces and civilian state agencies. However, this service providing interoperability communications was terminated as of May 2015 based on a decision by USAF and ARMY MARS. MARS also provides testing of Military Standard communication modes for use by MARS members. HF antenna at Fort Meade for Grecian Firebolt 2005. MARS participates in exercises such as Grecian Firebolt to help support military communications. MARS members from all around the world played a role in Grecian Firebolt 2005 by sending exercise Essential Elements of Information (EEI) reports through the MARS radio network. The EEI's consisted of scenario disaster information. When the EEI's were received, they were sorted and sent to Army Military Intelligence centers. MARS played a large part in reporting up-to-date information on disasters and requesting military assistance using a dispersed and redundant radio network. MARS also supports government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and participates in programs such as the Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications SHAred RESources (SHARES). The traditional land or sea-based MARS Radio Phone Patch is largely a thing of the past because land and sea-based MARS stations have been dismantled in favor of Satellite Phones. However, modern military aircraft are still equipped with HF radios, and many military aircrews still use MARS Phone Patches as a backup or substitute to Satellite Communications.

His name is inscribed on the southern pillar of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.  Early career  Born at Bar-le-Duc, Exelmans entered the French Revolutionary Army at 16, joining the 3rd battalion of Meuse volunteers in 1791. During the War of the First Coalition, he served in the armies of the Moselle and Sambre-et-Meuse, rising through the enlisted ranks to become Sergeant Major by 1796. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in October 1796, and joined the Army of Italy in 1797 for the invasion of Italy. In 1798, he became aide-de-camp to General Ebl√©, and in the following year, he was aide-de-camp to General Broussier. He distinguished himself in his first campaign in Italy, and in April 1799 was promoted to the provisional rank of captain in the 16th dragoon regiment. In the same year. In 1801, he was made aide-de-camp to Marshal Joachim Murat, with whom he became close friends.  Aide-de-camp to Marshal Murat  Exelmans at the action of Wertingen During the campaigns against the Third and Fourth Coalitions from 1805 to 1807, he served as Murat's aide-de-camp. At the crossing of the Danube, and in the battle of Wertingen he especially distinguished himself. He was appointed to the rank of Colonel two days before the battle of Elchingen, and was made a Brigadier General in May 1807. Peninsular War, captivity and Naples At the start of the Peninsular War in 1808, Exelmans accompanied Marshal Murat to Spain. In June, he was sent to join Marshal Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey's army which was marching to attack Valencia. At this time, the Spanish countryside was rife with rebellion and he was captured by partisans and taken to Valencia. He was handed over to the British and taken to England as a prisoner. Escaping in 1811, he travelled to Naples, where Murat, who was reigning as King, appointed him as his Equerry. Invasion of Russia Exelmans rejoined the Grande Arm√©e on the eve of Napoleon's invasion of Russia and was appointed Major in the Grenadiers √† Cheval de la Garde Imp√©riale. In the aftermath of the Battle of Borodino, he was promoted to G√©n√©ral de Division and took command of the light cavalry division. Wounded in the Battle of Vilnius, he returned to Paris on convalescent leave. War of the Sixth Coalition R√©mi Joseph Isidore Exelmans by Charles-Philippe Larivi√®re Upon recovering from his wound in 1813, he rejoined the Imperial army in Dresden. He was present at the disastrous defeat at Leipzig, and following the campaign in Germany was made a Grand Officer in the Legion of Honour. With France's enemies closing in, Exelmans fought courageously until the allies occupied Paris and Napoleon abdicated, ending the War of the Sixth Coalition. Hundred Days When the Bourbons were restored, Exelmans was made Inspector General and a knight of St Louis. In January 1815, he was tried on accusations of having treasonable relations with Murat, but was acquitted. Upon Napoleon's return from Elba in the Hundred Days, Exelmans was temporarily made a Peer of France, and was placed in command of the II Cavalry Corps, consisting of Major General Strolz's 9th Cavalry Division and Major General Chastel's 10th Cavalry Division. During the Waterloo Campaign, the corps fought in the battles of Ligny and Wavre. In the final operations around Paris, he won distinction on 1 July at the Battle of Rocquencourt, where units under his command isolated and destroyed an advanced Prussian hussar brigade under the command of Colonel von Sohr.  Restoration, July Monarchy, and Second Republic  After Napoleon was finally defeated and the Bourbons were once again restored, the royal decree of 24 July 1815 declared that Exelmans and 56 other generals who had sworn allegiance to the king and then joined Napoleon upon his return were to be tried for a variety of charges, including treason. Exelmans fled to the Netherlands, where he lived in exile until 1819, when he was granted amnesty and returned to France. In 1828, he was appointed inspector-general of cavalry. In the Revolution of 1848, Exelmans was one of the supporters of Louis Napol√©on. In recognition of his loyalty to the Bonapartes, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour and was made Grand Chancellor of the order in 1849. In 1851, he was elevated to the rank of Marshal of France. His death in 1852 was the result of a fall from his horse.

He did a number of coverages in France and in the Middle East. Although he worked together with Robert Doisneau and Edouard Boubat in particular, he has always remained very discreet and has only exhibited his works once in the near suburbs of Paris. He nevertheless took photographs of such various figures as Blaise Cendrars, Jean Cocteau, Paul Fort, Lino Ventura, Habib Bourguiba or Madame Ren√© Coty in their homes, and was regarded as a first rank photographer in fashion and industry. More particularly he was one of the first to take coloured photographs on a wide scale and in big format print (4\\"x 5\\" and 5\\"x17\\"m) and the first to process his proper colour films in Paris (Ektachrome E3). This technical skill - rather unusual at the time - coupled with an ability to carry out special tricks and effects (stroboscopic effect through multiple exposure, use of electric lighting on a large scale with flash ramps) has contributed to his success in the press and industry (EDF, Ribet-Desjardins, L'Or√©al, Formica, Synergie ...)\\" External links *A few images to see here Category:1925 births Category:French photographers Category:2007 deaths ","title":"Jean Chamoux"},{"id":"2182059","text":"A version of the Z√∂llner illusion The Z√∂llner illusion is an optical illusion named after its discoverer, German astrophysicist Johann Karl Friedrich Z√∂llner.

This creates the illusion that the black lines are not parallel. The shorter lines are on an angle to the longer lines, and this angle helps to create the impression that one end of the longer lines is nearer to the viewer than the other end. This is similar to the way the Wundt illusion appears. It may be that the Z√∂llner illusion is caused by this impression of depth. This illusion is similar to the Hering illusion, the Poggendorff illusion and the M√ºller-Lyer illusion. All these illusions demonstrate how lines can seem to be distorted by their background.

It was housed in the Read Block building, on the site of the home of colonial poet Anne Bradstreet. The Tasty closed in 1997, after 81 years in business. Its location was later used by the chain stores Abercrombie & Fitch, then Citizens Bank and, the current occupant, a CVS Pharmacy. Description The exterior of The Tasty, 1996 The Tasty was a tiny one-room diner and lunch counter, its customer area no more than seven feet wide and thirty feet deep, with a narrow counter made of yellow linoleum. A Harvard Business School student once deemed it \\"the most profitable restaurant in New England per sq ft\\", at . The Tasty had 14 stools. On busy nights it would be crammed with around 70 people (from actual head counts) at a time. On these nights between 300‚Äì400 burgers were served between the hours of midnight and 4:00 AM. A large map, studded with pins, covered the back wall of the diner and claimed to pinpoint the origins of postcards from customers over the years. In keeping with the informal atmosphere of the diner ‚Äî where the cooks, including Tom Sweet, who managed The Tasty on the graveyard shift until the summer of 1976, and chef Charlie Coney ‚Äî were sometimes compared to bartenders and frequently chatted with customers. Customers By the end of its existence, The Tasty had attracted both long-time residents and, by virtue both of its proximity to Harvard Yard and its late opening hours, numerous students from Harvard University, and had become one of the few places where students and residents, and residents from different social and economic classes, mixed informally. According to one historian, \\"you could sit next to a professor on your left, and a homeless person on your right\\".http://artfilmdesign.com/mp3/artfilmdesign-2005-10-04.mp3 Media references The Tasty was often referred to in the press as a \\"local landmark\\" or \\"institution\\",https://web.archive.org/web/20041128134653/http://www.boston.com/travel/boston/articles/2004/07/25/where_cambridge_meets/ and was immortalized in film during a scene in Good Will Hunting. It was also used in a scene during Love Story, Erich Segal's story of a privileged Harvard Law School student (Ryan O‚ÄôNeal) and his working-class girlfriend (Ali MacGraw). It is also the subject of Federico Muchnik's 2005 documentary, Touching History.Touching History; Harvard Square, The Bank, and the Tasty Diner full video Closure A close-up of the neon sign in the window Despite a struggle by its owner Peter Haddad, the Tasty‚Äôs tenancy ended in November 1997. A sign in its window during the move-out stated its lifespan: \\"81 years. 29,565 days. 5,913,000 people. 422,357 per stool.\\" Its landlord, the Cambridge Savings Bank, took advantage of the increasing attractiveness of the Harvard Square neighborhood to chain store franchises, which enabled the bank to charge significantly higher rents to tenants who provided greater security. Opposition to the end of the Tasty's tenancy was voiced by a number of groups, including the Harvard Square Defense Fund and brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi, 'Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers' on their radio talk show, Car Talk. The Tasty became a cause c√©l√®bre and a symbol of the transitions the neighborhood was undergoing. Despite having brought considerable evidence attesting to the historical value of the diner and the important social role it played in Harvard Square, the supporters of the Tasty did not prevail; however, the Cambridge City Council required that the distinctive entrance to the Tasty be preserved, giving it landmark status, and it remains unmodified today. The attention paid to the closing of the Tasty by the Cambridge City Council in the Winter of 1997 occasioned a rebuke from the Harvard Square Business Association, who criticized the council for becoming involved in a private, contractual matter. For a time, an Abercrombie & Fitch store operated in the building on the site formerly occupied by the Tasty. This store was later succeeded by a branch office of Citizens Bank, and the actual space in which the Tasty once operated became occupied by a row of Citizens Bank ATMs. As Muchnik remarks, \\"if you look at the bank in the Read Block today, you have one door too many\\" ‚Äî the extraneous door, a second entrance to the small ATM lobby, being that of the former diner. Following a relocation of Citizens Bank to Brattle Square, a CVS Pharmacy since opened in its place. The end of the Tasty's tenure in the Square is considered a side effect of gentrification; the small, confined space of the Tasty, its prices (far lower than any other restaurant in the Square at the time of its closing) and friendly neighborhood atmosphere attracted patrons from all socio-economic strata and contrasted, in many ways, with the more upscale stores and restaurants emerging ‚Äî and transforming ‚Äî the Harvard Square community. The local hamburger chain Tasty Burger opened a location not far from the Tasty in 2012.

Games 1 and 2 were played in Memorial Stadium in Baltimore; Games 3‚Äì5 were played at the Oakland Coliseum. It was the second match-up between the two teams in the ALCS. Summary =Oakland A's vs. Baltimore Orioles= Game summaries =Game 1= In Game 1, Jim Palmer spent 16 minutes retiring the side in the top of the first inning. He walked the first two batters and struck out the next three. The Orioles went to work against lefty Vida Blue and his successor, Horacio Pi√±a in the bottom half. Merv Rettenmund singled and Paul Blair walked before Tommy Davis's RBI double put the Orioles up 1‚Äì0. Don Baylor then walked and one out later, Earl Williams's two-run single knocked Pina out of the game. Andy Etchebarren was hit by a pitch to load the bases and Mark Belanger's RBI single made it 4‚Äì0 Orioles. They added to their lead on Etchebarren's RBI single in the seventh and Baylor's RBI single in the eighth, both with two on off of Blue Moon Odom. It was more than they needed as Palmer pitched a five-hit shutout, striking out 12 A's along the way. =Game 2= The Orioles' ALCS winning streak was snapped at 10 in Game 2. Bert Campaneris led off the game with a home run off of Dave McNally, but the Orioles tied the game in the bottom of the first when Al Bumbry drew to leadoff walk, moved to third on a single and scored on Tommy Davis's groundout. Back-to-back home runs leading off the sixth by Joe Rudi and Sal Bando off of McNally put the A's up 3‚Äì1. In the bottom half, the Orioles got back-to-back leadoff singles before Earl Williams's one-out RBI double cut Oakland's lead to 3‚Äì2. Bando's second home run of the game in the eighth off of McNally padded Oakland's lead to 5‚Äì2. The Orioles hit two singles in the bottom half off of Catfish Hunter, who was relieved by Rollie Fingers and Brooks Robinson's RBI single made it 5‚Äì3 Oakland, but they got that run back in the ninth when Angel Mangual hit a leadoff single off of Bob Reynolds, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt and passed ball, and scored on Campaneris's single. Hunter, who served up so many during the season that he threatened an A.L. record, allowed none as the A's evened the series as the two teams headed to Oakland for Game 3\\\\. =Game 3= The third game, postponed a day by the lack of a dome‚Äîthe postponement trigged a rhubarb between A.L. President Joe Cronin and A's President Charlie Finley‚Äîwas played at Oakland and produced a brilliant pitching battle between a pair of southpaws, Mike Cuellar of Baltimore and Ken Holtzman. Up to that point, Cuellar had allowed only three hits. he had a one-hit shutout for the first seven innings as he carefully nursed a 1‚Äì0 lead given him by Earl Williams' homer in the second inning. But in the eighth, pinch-hitter Jes√∫s Alou singled and pinch-runner Allan Lewis was sacrificed to second by Mike Andrews. The play was controversial in that Cuellar appeared to have a force out at second base, but he ignored catcher Etchebarren's yells and took the safe out at first. This proved costly as, one out later, Joe Rudi singled home Lewis to tie the score. Bert Campaneris, first man up in the 11th, snapped a 1‚Äì1 tie by hitting Cuellar's second pitch over the left-field fence for a home run. =Game 4= In Game 4, The A's knocked out Jim Palmer with a three-run outburst in the second inning. After a leadoff double and subsequent single, Ray Fosse's double scored two and Dick Green's double scored another. The A's made it 4‚Äì0 in the sixth on Fosse's bases-loaded sacrifice fly off of Bob Reynolds. Vida Blue pitched six shutout innings before falling apart in the seventh. Earl Williams drew a base on balls with one out and Don Baylor followed with a single. Brooks Robinson came through with a run-producing single and Andy Etchebarren hit the next pitch for a home run, making the score 4‚Äì4. The next inning, Bobby Grich hit a home run off Rollie Fingers and that, coupled with Grant Jackson's stout relief pitching, gave the game to the Orioles. =Game 5= A surprisingly small crowd of 24,265 showed up for the final game and they saw Catfish Hunter pitch a five-hit shutout, winning 3‚Äì0. The A's first run in the game come in the third inning when Ray Fosse reached first on an error by third baseman Brooks Robinson, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on a single by Joe Rudi. Right-hander Doyle Alexander lasted only until the fourth inning. In that frame he was the victim of a single by Gene Tenace, who scored on a triple by Vic Davalillo before Jesus Alou added an RBI single.

Biography Although Spalding's books claimed he was born in England in 1857, Spalding was also reported born in North Cohocton, New York in 1872. He spent much of his life as a mining engineer in the American West. Research on his life and the purported eleven person research expeditions to the Far East beginning in 1894 to study the \\"Masters\\" has turned up evidence and pictures that are included in later volumes of his book. Spalding visited the Far East first in the late 1800s and then again in the 1920s and then again in the 1935 trip to India at the bequest of his publisher, Devorss & Company.http://www.bairdtspalding.org/frequently-asked-questions-about-baird- t-spalding/ Anecdotal biographical detail was widely promulgated even during his lifetime. At his death in 1953 in Arizona, obituaries conflictingly cited his age as 95 or 107. His date of birth is given as \\"1872-1873\\" in the 1880 US census. However, that could mean that was the time he first came to the US as at that time it was common for foreigners to be given a new birth date and name when they first arrive in the US. The same date is given in a 1911 California marriage certificate. In other records his place of birth is given as England with him emigrating to the US later.When and where was Baird T Spalding born? part 1, part 2 (2009) Spalding did briefly visit India in 1935 as there is a US passport application dated 1935, and a Seattle immigration record on his return from India, dated 1936. A biography of Spalding, Baird T Spalding As I Knew Him was published by fellow mystic and DeVorss author David Bruton in 1954. About Spalding's claims regarding his birthplace, Bruton wrote: Works In 1924, Spalding published the first volume of Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East. It describes the travels to India and Tibet of a research party of eleven scientists in 1894. During their trip they claim to have made contact with \\"the Great Masters of the Himalayas\\", immortal beings with whom they lived and studied, gaining insight into their lives and spiritual message. This close contact enabled them to witness many of the spiritual principles evinced by these Great Masters translated into their everyday lives, which Spalding describes as acts that can be accomplished by anyone who comes to know his \\"TRUE\\" self. Such examples are walking on water, or manifesting bread to feed the hungry party - similar to some acts performed by eastern masters in more recent times. However, despite most of the action taking place in India, the Great Masters make it clear that the greatest embodiment of the Enlightened state is that of the Christ - the discovery of man's source of power within himself - that light of God - the Christ consciousness is that \\"Christ\\" state: > The Masters accept that Buddha represents the Way to Enlightenment, but they > clearly set forth that the Christ Consciousness is Enlightenment, or a state > of consciousness for which we are all seeking ‚Äì the Christ light of every > individual; therefore, the light of every child born into the world.From the > foreword, Volume I, Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East, > DeVorss & Co. Death and influence Spalding published three additional volumes before his death in 1953. Volumes 5 and 6 were published by DeVorss & Co posthumously from various articles that Spalding had written. Spalding's books have remained in print since his death and his stories have helped to popularize the concept of Ascended Masters which became a common meme in New Age and alternative religious movements during the later twentieth century. During the 1920s, Spalding was a personal acquaintance of Guy Ballard, also a mining engineer and founder of the I AM activity. Similar themes to Spalding can be seen in Ascended Master groups such as the Church Universal and Triumphant and the writings of Elizabeth Clare Prophet. Spalding is named as an influence in the writings of New Age figures such as JZ Knight, Paul Baumann of the Methernitha sect and Father Divine. The growth of the New Age movement during the 1970s resulted in a renewal of interest in Spalding, and several New Age figures have claimed tenuous connections to him after his death. American mystic Thane of Hawaii, founder of the Prosperos group, claimed in 1974 to have ghost-written several of Spalding's later books and accompanied him on his 1935 India tour. Vietnam publication There is a Vietnamese book, apparently first published in 1975, called H√†nh Tr√¨nh V·ªÅ Ph∆∞∆°ng ƒê√¥ng by one Nguy√™n Phong. It purports to be the translation of a book written by Spalding in India in 1924. The book has gained some popularity in Vietnam, and an English translation was published in 2009, as Journey to the East. In the story, Spalding is joined in India by a group of prestigious mystics and academics, including Paul Brunton and Walter Evans-Wentz.Hanh Trinh Ve Phuong Dong ‚Äì A Vietnamese prelude to Spalding's Life and Teachings? \\"there is a Vietnamese book that claims to be a previously unknown prelude to Spalding's Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East [... purportedly] translated in[to] Vietnamese in 1975 from a 1924 Indian book titled Journey to the East. The first publication date shown online is 1987, with Spalding listed as author and Nguy√™n Phong as the translator into Vietnamese. According to Google Books, Nguy√™n Phong has translated similar books in the mystic and occult genre, including works by Lobsang Rampa, Myodo Satomi and Mika Waltari. Most of this book is available online, and despite the imperfect translation of Google Translate it is quite fascinating. All of the facts point to this book being a derivative fictional work written by Phong, rather than a translation of Spalding.\\" References  External links  *Spalding biography and research *Biography Category:American spiritual writers Category:1872 births Category:1857 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Cohocton, New York ","title":"Baird T.

He defended his remarks in subsequent radio and television appearances by pointing to the historical contribution of youth to social idealism and cultural innovation. He won the Best First Book Award from the American Academy of Religion in 2001 for his book The Manichaean Body in Discipline and Ritual, notable for its analysis of religions as goal-oriented systems of practice rationalized within particular models of reality.AAR Book Awards His evident interest in the role religions play in forming and organizing the individual self can be seen in his multi-volume study of Augustine of Hippo. His 2003 book, Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament, generated considerable controversy for highlighting cases of theological bias in the translation process, by which, he argues, contemporary Christian views are anachronistically introduced into the Bible versions upon which most modern English-speaking Christians rely. In 2013 he published The First New Testament, which offers a (partial) reconstructed translation into English of the first Christian canon of scripture in Greek, created in the 2nd century C.E. by the Christian leader Marcion.

It does not actually walk, however, instead shuffling on wheels hidden under its \\"feet\\" at approximately . This means it is not technically a walker; it merely has the appearance of one. It was invented by Masaaki Nagumo and created by researchers who hope to someday create similar robots to be used in the military and in defense against crimes. But for now it is used as a way to promote the idea of robotic defense.  Design  The Land Walker stands at about tall, weighing about . It \\"walks\\", or shuffles, at a speed of around . It has a cockpit, similar to a small airplane, big enough to seat one human. Two cannons are mounted on the arms of the robot which shoots out rubber or plastic balls. It is the world's first genuine bipedal robot because unlike previous robots that are unipedal, the Land Walker moves its feet one at a time by shuffling each foot with wheels.  Uses  The Sakakibara Kikai Company researchers in Japan built the Land Walker to initially be used in exhibits and demonstrations, as it is not yet the perfect robot. For now it shoots soft rubber balls from its two cannons, but someday it could shoot out more severe weapons, like bullets and bombs. With more research development and funding, a bigger motor, and more speed, the Land Walker could become a powerful defense, as well as a great psychological weapon because it would intimidate and cause fear in opponents.  History  The concept of giant, human-like robots have been around for years. These ideas appear in TV shows such as The Six Million Dollar Man, films such as Alien and Star Wars, and science fiction comics and books. People like the idea of these giant robots because it keeps the dreams of people alive, meaning that they stay hopeful that one day these robots will exist. Although the Land Walker was created in 2006 as the first bipedal robot, there are many more similar robots throughout history from different countries and cultures. = Previous human-like machines =  Mecha  The idea of two-legged giant robots has been around for years. Mecha, meka in Japanese, refers to all things mechanical, including cars, computers, and even human-like robots. Mechas are popular in the science fiction genre of video games, films, comics, and TV series; typically, they work in construction, politics, or fighting wars. Additionally, \\"mecha\\" is used to refer to large and bulky suits that protect the human. In contemporary Western culture, \\"mecha\\" is often used to refer to building sized robots.  Enryu  The Land Walker is very similar to the biped robot Enryu, which was also created by the Sakakibara Kikai Co. in Tmsuk, Japan. The Enryu stands at a height of . It shuffles faster than the Land Walker because it uses caterpillar-like tracks instead of legs. It was built to help in emergency situations, like rushing into a burning building, lifting heavy objects, and rescuing people. Its arms act like human arms, which is different from the Land Walker's arms.  Kid's Walker Cyclops  Weighing around and standing at about tall, the Kid's Walker Cyclops is a battery-operated mecha made for the purpose of kids playing around. It has a cockpit that children sit in to control the arms of the mecha, which has a grappling hook and a power drill. It moves by shuffling its feet, which is similar to the Land Walker's movement.  i-Foot  Toyota Motor Corp. created a biped robot called the i-Foot in 2004 that can carry a human up a flight of stairs. This is a significant invention because it helps the disabled get around easier.  Human abilities and features enhanced by machines  Machines like the Land Walker demonstrate how technology can be used to enhance human abilities. Also, the technology and use of these mecha indicate their feasibility for military use. The robots can be made to climb over terrain and obstacles that military tanks cannot cope with. Moreover, these giant robots have heights greater than humans and can see over humans and look down upon opponents, further aiding the military. However, a disadvantage is that the legs of these robots are very expensive and intricate, so it limits the number of robots that can be created.

Other episodes included Dragon's Blood and Ratha's Creature. The show grew out of a feature on Keeshan's Captain Kangaroo series. Unique for an American television series, the series featured open captions captioned by the National Captioning Institute for the hearing impaired during its 1993 reairing, instead of the usual closed captioning. In addition to being a convenience for the hearing-impaired, this also allowed those who could hear to read along with the story. The episodes were produced by Australia's Southern Star Productions and America's Hanna-Barbera Australia for CBS Entertainment Productions. One of its crew members, Sander Schwartz, became the president of Warner Bros. Animation in 2002. Select episodes were released on home video in 1992 under the title Video Storybreak.

Known for her distinctive and powerful voice, Wash first achieved fame as half of the Two Tons O' Fun, who sang backing for American disco singer Sylvester including on his signature hit \\"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\\". After gaining their own record deal, they released three consecutive commercially successful songs which all peaked at number 2 in the dance charts. The duo was renamed The Weather Girls in 1982 after they released the top-selling single \\"It's Raining Men\\", which brought them to mainstream pop attention. The Weather Girls released five albums and were heavily featured on Sylvester's albums. After disbanding in 1988, Wash transitioned to house music as a featured artist on several successful songs. Her success on Billboard's Dance chart has earned her the honorific title The Queen of Clubland, with a total of fifteen number-one songs on the chart to date. Wash is also noted for sparking legislation in the early 1990s that made vocal credits mandatory on CDs and music videos. Starting in the late-1980s, her studio vocals were used in numerous successful dance songs without her permission. Models lip-synced to her voice both in music videos and during live performances. As a result, Wash's identity was unknown and she was denied credit and royalties for many of the songs she recorded. This included platinum-selling song \\"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\\" as she had been labeled \\"unmarketable\\" due to her weight. Subsequently, in Rolling Stone, music critic Jason Newman described Martha Wash as \\"The Most Famous Unknown Singer of the '90s\\".. In December 2016, Billboard magazine ranked her as the 58th most successful dance artist of all-time. Early life Wash attended in McKinley Elementary and graduated from San Francisco Polytechnic High School, where she sang in the school choir.

She was the founder under British Airways of budget airline Go Fly and was the first leader of London's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Personal life Barbara Cassani was born in Boston to James and Noreen Cassani. She studied at Mount Holyoke College, graduating magna cum laude with a BA (Hons) international relations in 1982; and is also a former trustee of Mount Holyoke.Trustees - Mount Holyoke College Cassani earned a master's degree, again in international relations, from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. She was awarded an honorary degree from Cranfield University in 2004. \\\\- at Cranfield Barbara Cassani married British investment banker Guy Davis in 1985. The couple have two children, Lauren and James. She is a keen horse rider, and competes in eventing, showjumping, and dressage events. Since stepping down from the Olympic bid, Cassani has been working on plans for a new startup company, and appears as a business and management speaker on the public speaking circuit.Cassani page - at London Speaker Bureau Professional life Upon graduation in 1984, Cassani worked as a management consultant for Coopers & Lybrand before moving to work in the US operation of British Airways. There, she worked in sales, marketing, and on the team that integrated Dan-Air into BA's business. In 1997, facing increasing competition from low cost airlines Ryanair and EasyJet, British Airways decided to found its own budget offering, to be known as 'Go'. Chief Executive Bob Ayling selected Cassani for the task, giving her only ¬£25 million in seed capital. The company began operations in 1998 and reached profitability two years later. In 2001, Cassani led a management buyout of the company (with most of the funding coming from venture capital firm 3i), and became its first Chief Executive. In 2002, Cassani won the Veuve Clicquot Businesswoman of the Year award.Cassani - at Mt. Holyoke Later that year, the airline was bought by rival EasyJet (a move bitterly opposed by Cassani) and she was not offered a position in the merged company. She next released a book detailing her experiences at Go; Go - An Airline Adventure () won a number of business publishing awards the following year. In October 2003, Cassani became a non-executive director of retailer Marks & Spencer, a position she relinquished when she accepted the Olympic position. After her Olympic tenure, she was one of the executives mooted as taking over as the struggling company's Chief Executive. =London 2012 Olympics bid= In June 2003, Cassani was appointed to chair London's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. The organizing committee felt that her business background would give the bid a badly needed professionalism; the organizational reputation of British sport had already been tarnished when it won the right to host the 2005 World Athletics Championships but was forced to withdraw when the promised stadium could not be built. Cassani's selection surprised many commentators, as she was unknown in the highly political world of Olympic sport. Although she was married to a Briton and had lived in the UK for more than a decade, her American nationality also raised some eyebrows. She led the bid through the first phase of the two-stage bidding process. During her tenure, the newly formed bid team grew to a staff of 80, with many large institutional backers, and gained increasing approval from a sceptical British public and political class. Her team created the bid's master plan, which detailed where events would be held, what infrastructure would be built, and provided an overall budget projection for the Games. This was submitted to the International Olympic Committee in the spring of 2004, and on the strength of it London was selected as one of the five candidate cities. In March 2004, the Daily Telegraph diary column printed claims that Cassani had been highly critical of Tony Blair, saying \\"To be frank he wasn't very bright ... the subject he got most animated about was beach volleyball.\\" Cassani sued for libel saying that the story was not only completely without foundation but also highly damaging to the bid; on April 21, the Telegraph admitted that she had made none of the remarks attributed to her, and agreed to apologise in print, pay her costs, and make a donation to the Olympic bid committee. In May 2004, Cassani announced she was stepping down as chairman in favour of Olympic gold medallist and politician Lord Coe, saying that she felt the bid had reached a stage where his track record in the Olympic movement would be more useful to the bid than her technical and managerial experience. Some commentators felt, however, that her departure had been precipitated by internal politics in the British sports establishment. Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, whom she had appointed as the bid's ambassador, quit the effort shortly after she stepped down, saying the way Cassani had been treated was \\"shocking.\\" Cassani stayed on with the bid, serving under Coe as Vice Chairman responsible for technical aspects of the bid. She continued to serve on the board (working unpaid one day per week); the IOC awarded the XXXth Olympiad to London on 6 July 2005. On 24 September 2007, Cassani became the new chairman of the board at Vueling Airlines, replacing Jose Miguel Abab Silvestre, who resigned abruptly citing \\"managerial differences.\\" Vueling, founded in 2004, is a airline based in Barcelona, Spain, whose share value in the stock market had dropped by 30% earlier in 2007. Board members Jose Creuheras Margenat and Ferran Conti Penina also resigned.\\"Vueling chairman Jose Miguel Abab resigns\\" - Thomson Financial - (c/o CNBC) - 25 Sep 2007 Since 2013, Vueling has been part of International Airlines Group which also owns British Airways. Barbara Cassani was appointed Executive Chairperson of Jurys Inn hotels in 2008.

Dr. E. Glenn Wagner, Chancellor of Oxford Graduate School, has referred to it as a \\"flagship congregation of the Baptist General Conference\\",Wagner, E. Glenn, Escape from Church, Inc.: The Return of the Pastor-Shepherd, p. 210, Zondervan (2001), , , accessed November 27, 2009 and C. Douglas Weaver, Director of Undergraduate Studies and Associate Professor of Religion at Baylor University, has called \\"the best-known congregation in the Baptist General Conference at the turn of the 21st century\\".Weaver, C. Douglas, In search of the New Testament church: the Baptist story; Baptists: History, Literature, Theology, Hymns, pp. 232‚Äì33, Mercer University Press (2008), , It is also affiliated with the Minnesota Baptist Conference. The church has three campuses: the main campus in downtown Minneapolis and satellite campuses in Mounds View and Lakeville. From 1980 until January 2013, Bethlehem's senior pastor was John Piper. History In the early 1870s, J. L. Johnson became the first Swede baptized by immersion in Minneapolis‚Äîin 30-below weather. He and a growing number of Swedes joined First Baptist Church (Minneapolis), and eventually formed a Swedish Bible class. On June 22, 1871, they branched off, with First Baptist's blessing, and founded Bethlehem‚Äîoriginally as the First Swedish Baptist Church of Minneapolis.. This was 7 years after the American Civil War ended, and 13 years after Minnesota became a State, in a hall at 2nd Street and Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis, with 22 charter members. Pastor John Ring laid the foundation for the church,Sch√∂n, Anders, 'History of the Swedes of Illinois,, Volume 1, p. 576, The Engberg-Holmberg publishing company (1908), accessed November 27, 2009 which was the first Swedish Baptist church in the Twin Cities area. In March 1872, the church bought a lot at 6th Street and 12th Avenue for $1,000 ($ today); they broke ground in March of the following year on a new $4,000 wood frame church building.Peterson, Penny A., and Olson, Nathan Weaver, \\"Mill Ruins Park Research Study\\", pp. 8‚Äì9, May 2003, accessed November 27, 2009 The church had four pastors in its first ten years. The fifth pastor, Dr. Frank Peterson, arrived in June 1881 to a church of 127 members.Nelson, Olof Nickolaus, History of the Scandinavians and successful Scandinavians in the United States, pp. 470‚Äì71, O. N. Nelson & company (1899), accessed November 25, 2009 On March 16, 1885, during Peterson's pastorate, the church burned and was irreparable. In February 1888, 55 members of the church organized the Elim Swedish Baptist Church.Atwater, Isaac, History of the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Volume 1, p. 208, Munsell (1893), accessed November 27, 2009 The congregation learned that the Second Congregational Church at 8th Street and 13th Avenue South‚Äîonly 3 blocks from the burned site‚Äîwas available for $13,500 ($ today). The church bought the building and property in May 1885. Peterson was of the view that Scandinavian immigrants made the best Baptists, because, as he put it in 1886, they were Protestants, religious, weren't communists or socialists, and very few of them were \\"peddlars, organ grinders, or beggars.\\"Anderson, Philip J., and Blanck, Dag, Swedes in the Twin Cities: immigrant life and Minnesota's urban frontier, Volume 14 of Studia multiethnica Upsaliensia, Minnesota Historical Society Press (2001), , There were 445 members by January 1, 1891, when Peterson departed. Under Peterson's ministry, 12 young people became missionaries. One was Ola Hanson who became a missionary to the Kachin people of Burma for 40 years. Hanson put the Kachin language into writing, produced an 11,000-word Kachin-English dictionary, trained 40 local pastors, and translated the Bible into Kachin.Vedder, Henry C., A short history of Baptist missions, The Judson Press (1927), accessed 27 November 2009 The British government awarded him the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal. His story is told in a biography titled ‚ÄòLight in the Jungle‚Äô, by Gustaf Sword. The church's first services in English started in 1893, on a bi-weekly basis. The 6th pastor, Olof Bodien, came in 1893 and pastored until 1912. During that time the church suffered a fire (December 3, 1893) and a tornado (August 1904). History; First Baptist Church 1871‚Äì1921; p. 34\\\\. By this time a number of notable Swedish Baptists were members of the church.Strand, Algot E., A History of the Swedish-Americans of Minnesota: A Concise Record of the Struggles and Achievements of the Early Settlers, Together with a Narrative of what is Now Being Done by the Swedish-Americans of Minnesota in the Development of Their Adopted Country, Vol. 2, pp. 640, 692, 726, Lewis Publishing Company (1910), accessed November 25, 2009Marquis, Albert Nelson, The book of Minnesotans: a biographical dictionary of leading living men of the state of Minnesota, pp. 18‚Äì19, A. N. Marquis & Company (1907), accessed November 25, 2009 The church had two pastors from 1912‚Äì18, when the 8th pastor, Eric Carlson, arrived. Membership rose to 834, and language tension grew during that time between old (Swedish) and young (English). The 9th pastor, Anton Sjolund, came in 1928, and membership reached 1,204. Services in Swedish continued until the mid-1930, but on January 1, 1936, the church voted to move all services to English, except for one Swedish Sunday School class. Nine years later, on April 13, 1945, First Swedish Baptist voted to change its name to Bethlehem Baptist Church (the same year that the Swedish Baptist General Conference in America dropped \\"Swedish\\" from its name).Leonard, Bill J., Baptists in America, pp. 112‚Äì13 Columbia University Press (2007), , The 10th pastor, Eric Lindholm, came in 1949. He oversaw the building of the $500,000 ($ today) Sunday School Building, dedicated at year's end 1957 and still in use. The 11th pastor, John Wilcox, came in 1959 as the church's first non-Swedish pastor (he was originally a Southern Baptist), and pastored Bethlehem for 7 years. The 12th pastor was Robert Featherstone, and the 13th, Bruce Fleming, pastored through the 1970s. By 1980, Bethlehem was a somewhat typical downtown Minneapolis church. Most congregants lived in suburbs and commuted, including the pastor. The average age of the now 300-person congregation was 75 years old when the pulpit became open. The church decided to take a chance and bring in John Piper, who had never pastored. He had been teaching Bible at the denominational college, Bethel College. In 1983, Pastor Steller had a missionary epiphany, recognizing how the church's theology connected to world missions reaching unreached people, and a missions movement was born. The average age soon dropped from the 70s and 60s to the 20s. In 1991, the church had to do something no other downtown Minneapolis church had done in 60 years: find more room. Bethlehem enlarged her worship space; the building purchased in 1885 was demolished for a larger, 1,400 seat sanctuary. One of the stained glass windows from the original building is on display in the foyer. Another building addition came in 2003. In 2002, the church expanded its downtown ministry into the northern Minneapolis by creating a second campus. Instead of building a larger worship center downtown, nearly half the congregation began worshiping in Maranatha Hall at Northwestern College in Roseville. In June 2005, the church moved into its current North Campus facility in Mounds View. In September 2006, Bethlehem launched its third campus at Burnsville High School. In September 2018, the church moved into its current South Campus facility in Lakeville. Congregants of the three Bethlehem Baptist Churches all hear the same sermon, which is delivered in person in one location and on video screens at the other two.Strickler, Jeff, \\"Chain Churches,\\" The Star Tribune, February 8, 2008, accessed November 25, 2009 On July 26, 2020 the congregation voted to approve three pastors for preaching and vision, one for each campus.

A cafeteria worker at the local elementary school in the town of South Park, Colorado, Chef is generally portrayed as more intelligent than the other adult residents of the town, and understanding to the children. His advice is often sought by the show's core group of child protagonists ‚ÄîStan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick ‚Äî as he is the only adult they completely trust. To an inadvertent fault, he frequently gives inappropriate advice, usually in the non sequitur form of a lascivious soul song. Chef was inspired by Hayes and other popular soul singers of the 1970s, as well as an actual dining hall worker encountered by series co-creator Trey Parker while he attended the University of Colorado. Chef played a less prominent role as the series progressed beyond its earlier seasons, and the character was retired at the beginning of the tenth season in \\"The Return of Chef\\" following the controversial departure of Hayes. Character In tradition with the show's animation style, Chef is composed of simple geometrical shapes, and is animated with use of a computer, though he is given the impression of being a construction paper cutout composition animated through the use of stop motion, which was the technique used to animate the \\"Spirit of Christmas\\" shorts and the show's first episode. Chef is an overweight African American with a beard who usually wore blue pants and a red shirt. He frequently dons a traditional chef's hat and white apron on which the word \\"CHEF\\" is printed in black, even when he is not at work. Until Token Black and his family were given a more notable role starting in the show's fourth season, Chef was portrayed as the only black resident in all of South Park. Parker and co-creator Matt Stone initially planned to have one of themselves voice the character, fearing that their ideal candidates of Hayes (Lou Rawls and Barry White) would never agree to voice the character because the duo had admittedly and purposefully created him as a \\"stereotype\\" to reflect what they felt was the perception most inhabitants of less-diverse mountainous Colorado towns had of black people. However, Hayes agreed to voice the character due in part to the audacity of some of the show's early scripts. Chef (usually affectionately) referred to most people in town with the pejorative \\"crackers\\", including the children. Chef, after abandoning his musical aspirations, moved to South Park with plans to open his own restaurant. Before this, he had befriended several famous recording artists in the music industry, including Elton John and Meat Loaf, helping them to launch their successful careers. Despite failing at yet another dream, Chef made his way onto the South Park City Council, representing Public Safety. In addition to dispensing wisdom to the children and a few of the adult townsfolk, Chef speaks out against what he feels are outrageous ideas. For example, he opposes the rampant prescription of Ritalin in the episode \\"Timmy 2000\\", and he objects to the town's acceptance of Mr. Garrison committing purposefully flamboyant sadomasochistic acts in front of schoolchildren in \\"The Death Camp of Tolerance\\". In \\"Chef Goes Nanners\\", he briefly converts to Islam and adopted the name \\"Abdul Mohammed Jabar Rauf Kareem Ali\\" when he demanded that South Park change its official flag because it depicted the town's racist past. On several other occasions, Chef helped save South Park (and in a few other instances, the entire world) from potential disasters. Chef is also known for frequently engaging in casual sex, a habit he often expresses through song. He drives a 1980s woodie station wagon with a vanity plate that reads \\"LUV CHEF\\". He is often seen accompanied by numerous young women when at home or on vacation, and is even revealed to have had a one-night stand with Kathie Lee Gifford. He once resorted to male prostitution in an effort to raise money to pay legal fees, and had sex with nearly every woman in South Park before having to stop due to exhaustion. In \\"The Succubus\\", Chef briefly becomes an office worker and took up monogamy after meeting a woman named Veronica. The two were engaged to be married until it was revealed that Veronica was actually a succubus. In the South Park video game, the children can seek Chef's advice at one of the many buildings labelled \\"Chef's Shack O' Love\\", which is implied to be a brothel, complete with a naked woman in Chef's bed. Chef's parents, Nellie and Thomas McElroy, live in Scotland. The couple have made two major appearances in the episodes \\"The Succubus\\" and \\"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\\", and made a brief cameo in a town Christmas celebration in \\"Red Sleigh Down\\". They were not seen at Chef's funeral in \\"The Return of Chef\\". Chef is known to have run a quiz show called Chef's Luv Shack, as is apparent in the video game of the same name. Relationship with the children Chef endearingly calls the boys \\"the children\\" or just \\"children\\" (even when addressing one individually), and, unless he is preoccupied with a female companion, is usually willing to assist them with whatever help they need. He is consistently the only adult in town who the boys held in high regard, and they view him as their friend. They are also visibly saddened if his presence in their lives is threatened. In addition to being fans of his food (especially his trademark Salisbury steak), the boys often heartily anticipate encountering Chef when waiting in the school lunch line, so that they can explain whatever dilemma is affecting them, usually after their traditional greeting: > Chef: Hello there, children! > The boys [in unison]: Hey Chef! > Chef: How's it goin'? > The boys [one or in unison]: Bad. > Chef: Why \\"bad\\"? > The boys sometimes take it upon themselves to travel to Chef's house individually to seek his guidance on all manners of their problems, specifically relationships. He usually gives advice in the form of a soul song, which usually winds up being about sex, whether or not sex was relevant to the topic at hand. Hearing the songs would often leave the boys even more confused and with no further understanding of what they initially inquire about. In earlier seasons, Chef is often approached by the children when they are unfamiliar with a term that pertains to adult matters, such as \\"lesbian\\" or \\"prostitute\\". This happens so often that it eventually angers Chef, who pleads with them to stop asking questions he feels are not appropriate for him to answer. Despite this, the children continue asking these questions, much to his chagrin. An absent-minded Chef sometimes answers anyway, not realizing his lapse until the damage had been done. Chef acknowledges that doing this had repeatedly gotten him in trouble with his boss, Principal Victoria. Music In addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef also sings about things relevant to what has transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive R&B; style he had utilized during his own music career. Within the show, Chef is the original composer of these songs, including \\"Stinky Britches\\", which was depicted as having been covered by Alanis Morissette without proper credit to Chef. When Chef is left with legal debt after losing a court case to have himself credited as the song's original writer, several bands and artists (guest starring as themselves) hold a concert dubbed \\"Chef Aid\\", a parody of Live Aid, to raise the funds. The episode inspired a real-life album, Chef Aid: The South Park Album, which featured guest stars from the episode such as Elton John and Ozzy Osbourne. The album includes many of the full-length versions of the songs Chef had performed in the show's first two seasons; \\"Chocolate Salty Balls\\" was released as a single, and reached #1 in both the record charts of Ireland and the United Kingdom. As the series progressed and Chef's role became more intermittent, his spontaneous outbursts into song became less of a show standard. Parker and Stone originally planned to have Chef sing a song in every single episode but abandoned the idea after finding it too challenging and fearing writing too many songs would make them less funny, similar to their rationale for dispensing with Kenny's episodic deaths. Departure of Isaac Hayes Isaac Hayes provided the voice of Chef On January 4, 2006, Hayes defended South Park's style of controversial humor to The A.V. Club and XM's Opie and Anthony show, going so far as to note that although he was not pleased with the show's depiction of the Church of Scientology, of which he was a member, he \\"understood what Matt and Trey are doing.\\" However, on March 13, 2006, nearly two months after suffering a stroke,Hayes has put stroke, 'South Park' behind him , MySanAntonio.com, October 26, 2006. Hayes was reported to have quit South Park over objections to the show's attitudes toward and depiction of various religions, claiming that the show had crossed the line from satire into intolerance. Despite the content of the official press release, there remains considerable speculation about the motivations behind his departure. Parker and Stone assert that he quit due to the controversial episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", and its treatment of Scientology. Stone commented in a manner that suggested that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on South Park: \\"[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we [lampooned] Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin.\\" Fox News reporter Roger Friedman suggested that, because he was still suffering from the effects of his stroke, Hayes was hospitalized and not in a position to make a rational decision to leave the show. Friedman also reported that Hayes left the show because of the external pressure forced by his fellow Scientologists, the decision was not voluntary, and the original press release announcing his departure was put out by someone who was not authorized to represent him. In a 2016 oral history of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Hayes' son Isaac Hayes III confirmed that the decision to leave the show was made by Hayes' entourage while Hayes was unable to make such decisions on his own. Retirement \\"Darth\\" Chef Nine days after Hayes's departure from production, the controversy was satirized in the show's Season 10 premiere \\"The Return of Chef\\". For the episode, voice clips of Chef were taken from previous episodes and linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot, which involves Chef's leaving South Park to join the \\"Super Adventure Club\\", which eventually brainwashes Chef until he had the mindset of a child molester. The organization combines outdoor activities with child molestation, an act they perceive as justified because of their beliefs. After the boys are unable to convince Chef to come back to South Park, a rope bridge Chef is walking across is struck by lightning. He falls to a violent death, culminating with his mutilation at the hands of a grizzly bear and a mountain lion and finally discharged fecal matter (a reference to the episode \\"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\\", in which Cartman claims that the relaxation of the bowel muscles confirms that a person is really dead). South Park holds a memorial service for him (Canadian comedians Terrance and Phillip even attend, despite having never met the man themselves), in which Kyle gives a eulogy stating, \\"We shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us, we should be mad at that fruity little club for scrambling his brains\\", a deliberate parallel with Hayes' departure from the show in favor of Scientology. Mimicking a scene from the finale of Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, Chef's body is secretly collected by the Super Adventure Club, who managed to revive him as a cyborg ‚Äî identified on the show's official website as \\"Darth Chef\\" (a parody of Star Wars' Darth Vader). He is fitted with a suit and mask like those of Vader, except with the helmet taking on the appearance of Chef's trademark hat, and wields a red, glowing spatula, parodying Vader's red lightsaber. Darth Chef's voice was provided by British comedian and filmmaker Peter Serafinowicz, who voiced Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. Darth Chef has not made an appearance in subsequent episodes, but has appeared with other characters in the background of the South Park opening sequence, and is mentioned in the episode \\"Stunning and Brave\\", when PC Principal says the kids drove him to kill himself, which is not true. Chef is alluded to after his death in the season 10 episode \\"Hell on Earth 2006\\" where, during Satan's party, there are multiple scenes in which a Caucasian male dressed as Chef can be seen in the background. He is also referenced in the season 14 episode \\"Cr√®me Fraiche\\" when Randy becomes the new chef at school and greets the kids with Chef's trademark lines. Chef's death is also indirectly mentioned in the season 19 episode \\"Stunning and Brave\\" when PC Principal talks about all the things he finds offensive (incorrectly assuming that Chef's death was a suicide, before giving Butters detention for correcting him). Isaac Hayes himself died on August 10, 2008, two years after his departure from South Park. Chef makes an appearance in the 2014 video game South Park: The Stick of Truth as the reanimated Nazi Zombie penultimate boss later in the game. Once again, voice clips of Isaac Hayes as Chef are recycled from past episodes with the exception of recorded speech clips from Adolf Hitler. During his battle with the player and the other boys, Chef will express remorse by saying things like \\"I'm sorry, boys\\" and \\"what have I done?\\" While there were vague references to the Super Adventure Club and his death, there were no references to the Darth Chef suit. After being defeated, Chef regains control over his mind and tries to tell the boys, but he is then killed by Clyde and the New Kid.

The condition usually results in neurological disorders and death during childhood or teenage years. His life was the basis for the 1985 drama film Mask. Early life and diagnosis Rocky Dennis was born in Glendora, California, to Florence \\"Rusty\\" Tullis and Roy Dennis, his legal but not biological father. At the age of two he was diagnosed with craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, also known as CDD or lionitis, an extremely rare disease occurring in approximately one in every 220 million births, with fewer than 20 recorded cases. CDD is a bone disorder that causes calcium to build up in the skull.\\"Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia\\", Orpha.net Based on the small number of recorded cases, doctors predicted that the pressure from the calcium deposits would distort his face, destroy his eyesight and hearing, and eventually affect his brain, with death before his seventeenth birthday. Teen years Despite his eyesight limitations, hearing problems, and the painful headaches he endured, Dennis was eventually able to do a number of things his doctors predicted he would be unable to do. Dennis learned to read even though his poor eyesight kept him from reading books. He entered school at age six, although school authorities recommended against it; and after a slow start (he spent two years in the first grade) he was able to make academic progress before his death at 16. Dennis declined to have plastic surgery to correct his facial malformation. Dennis resided in Azusa, California, as well as Covina. There, along with his half-brother, Joshua, he lived with his parents and attended Ben Lomond Elementary School. Following his mother leaving the family, Dennis was raised for a time by his legal father and grandmother as well as his stepmother. Dennis died on October 4, 1978. His official cause of death was sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, a condition of unknown origins that may or may not have been related to his craniodiaphyseal dysplasia. Dennis' body was donated to UCLA Medical Center. Family Dennis's older half-brother, Joshua \\"John\\" Mason, died in 1987 at age 32 from complications of AIDS. Joshua did not appear and was not mentioned in Mask. His mother, Rusty Tullis, died on November 11, 2006, at age 70 as a result of an infection following a motorcycle accident. In popular culture Peter Bogdanovich directed the 1985 film Mask, adapted from Anna Hamilton Phelan's screenplay based on Dennis' life. Eric Stoltz portrayed Dennis. In one scene in the film, Stoltz's Dennis reads a poem to his mother, Rusty (played by Cher), that was written by Dennis. The movie is based loosely on Dennis' life, with most of the scenes and dialogue altered for dramatic purposes. Phelan adapted her screenplay into a stage musical of the same name, with music by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. The musical premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse in California on March 12, 2008. Swedish pop musician Jens Lekman self-published a song titled \\"Rocky Dennis' Farewell Song to the Blind Girl\\", causing DJs to mistakenly call the musician by Rocky Dennis' name.Jens Lekman Interview, Indiepop.

The Church published revised editions in 1940, 1979, and 1994, the latest of these called simply Common Order. Gaelic versions have long been available, and in 1996 the Church of Scotland produced \\"Leabhar Sheirbheisean\\", a Gaelic supplement to the Book of Common Order. Genevan Book of Order The Genevan Book of Order, sometimes called The Order of Geneva or Knox's Liturgy, is a directory for public worship in the Reformed Church of Scotland. In 1557 the Scottish Protestant lords in council enjoined the use of the English Common Prayer, i.e. the Second Book of Edward VI of 1552. Meanwhile, at Frankfurt, among the English Protestant exiles, there was a controversy between the upholders of the English liturgy and the French Reformed Order of Worship. By way of compromise, John Knox and other ministers drew up a new liturgy based upon earlier Continental Reformed Services, which was not deemed satisfactory, but which on his removal to Geneva he published in 1556 for the use of the English congregations in that city. The Geneva book made its way to Scotland and was used by some Reformed congregations there. Knox's return in 1559 strengthened its position, and in 1562 the General Assembly enjoined the uniform use of it as the Book of Our Common Order in the administration of the Sacraments and Solemnization of Marriages and Burials of the Dead. In 1564 a new and enlarged edition was printed in Edinburgh, and the Assembly ordered that every Minister, exhorter and reader should have a copy and use the Order contained therein not only for marriage and the sacraments but also in prayer, thus ousting the hitherto permissible use of the Second Book of Edward VI at ordinary service. The rubrics as retained from the Book of Geneva made provision for an extempore prayer before the sermons and allowed the minister some latitude in the other two prayers. The forms for the special services were more strictly imposed, but liberty was also given to vary some of the prayers in them. The rubrics of the Scottish portion of the book are somewhat stricter, and, indeed, one or two of the Geneva rubrics were made more absolute in the Scottish emendations; but no doubt the Book of Common Order is best described as a discretionary liturgy. It will be convenient here to give the contents of the edition printed by Andrew Hart at Edinburgh in 1611 and described (as was usually the case) as The Psalmes of David in Meeter, with the Prose, whereunto is added Prayers commonly used in the Kirke, and private houses; with a perpetuall Kalendar and all the Changes of the Moone that shall happen for the space of Six Veeres to come. They are as follows: *(i.) The Calendar; *(ii.) The names of the Faires of Scotland; *(iii.) The Confession of Faith used at Geneva and received by the Church of Scotland; *(iv.-vii.) Concerning the election and duties of Ministers, Elders and Deacons, and Superintendent; *(viii.) An order of Ecclesiastical Discipline; *(ix.) The Order of Excommunication and of Public Repentance; *(x.) The Visitation of the Sick; *(xi.) The Manner of Burial; *(xii.) The Order of Public Worship; Forms of Confession and Prayer after Sermon; *(xiii.) Other Public Prayers; *(xiv.) The Administration of the Lords Supper; *(xv.) The Form of Marriage; *(xvi.) The Order of Baptism; *(xvii.) A Treatise on Fasting with the order thereof; *(xviii.) The Psalms of David; *(xix.) Conclusions or Doxologies; *(xx.) Hymns; metrical versions of the Decalogue, Magnificat, Apostles' Creed, etc.; *(xxi.) Calvin's Catechism; and *(xxii. and xxiii.) Prayers for Private Houses and Miscellaneous Prayers, e.g. for a man before he begins his work. The Psalms and Catechism together occupy more than half the book. The chapter on burial is significant. In place of the long office of the Catholic Church we have simply this statement: \\"The corpse is reverently brought to the grave, accompanied with the Congregation, without any further ceremonies: which being buried, the Minister [if he be present and required] goeth to the Church, if it be not far off, and maketh some comfortable exhortation to the people, touching death and resurrection.\\" This (with the exception of the bracketed words) was taken over from the Book of Geneva. The Westminster Directory which superseded the Book of Common Order also enjoins interment without any ceremony, such being stigmatized as no way beneficial to the dead and many ways hurtful to the living. Civil honors may, however, be rendered. George Washington Sprott and Thomas Leishman, in the introduction to their edition of the Book of Common Order, and of the Westminster Directory published in 1868, collected a valuable series of notices as to the actual usage of the former book for the period (1564‚Äì1645) during which it was enjoined by ecclesiastical law. Where ministers were not available suitable persons (often old priests, sometimes schoolmasters) were selected as readers. Good contemporary accounts of Scottish worship are those of William Cowper of Galloway (1568‚Äì1619), bishop of Galloway, in his Seven Days Conference between a Catholic, Christian and a Catholic Roman (c. 1615), and Alexander Henderson in The Government and Order, of the Church of Scotland (1641). There was doubtless a good deal of variety at different times and in different localities. Early in the 17th century under the twofold influence of the Dutch Church, with which the Scottish clergy were in close connection, and of James VI's endeavours to justle out a liturgy which gave the liberty of conceiving prayers, ministers began in prayer to read less and extemporize more. Turning again to the legislative history, in 1567 the prayers were translated into Gaelic; in 1579 Parliament ordered all gentlemen and yeomen holding property of a certain value to possess copies. The assembly of 1601 declined to alter any of the existing prayers but expressed a willingness to admit new ones. Between 1606 and 1618 various attempts were made under English and Episcopal influence, by assemblies afterwards declared unlawful, to set aside the Book of Common Order. The efforts of James VI, Charles I and Archbishop Laud proved fruitless; in 1637 the reading of Laud's draft of a new form of service based on the English prayer book led to riots in Edinburgh and to general discontent in the country. The General Assembly of Glasgow in 1638 abjured Laud's book and took its stand again by the Book of Common Order, an act repeated by the assembly of 1639, which also demurred against innovations proposed by the English separatists, who objected altogether to liturgical forms, and in particular to the Lord's Prayer, the Gloria Patri and the minister kneeling for private devotion in the pulpit. An Aberdeen printer named Raban was publicly censured for having on his own authority shortened one of the prayers. The following years witnessed a counter attempt to introduce the Scottish liturgy into England, especially for those who in the southern kingdom were inclined to Presbyterianism. This effort culminated in the Westminster Assembly of divines which met in 1643, at which six commissioners from the Church of Scotland were present, and joined in the task of drawing up a Common Confession, Catechism and Directory for the three kingdoms. The commissioners reported to the General Assembly of 1644 that this Common Directory is so begun . . . \\"that we could not think upon any particular Directory for our own Kirk.\\" The General Assembly of 1645, after careful study, approved the new order. An act of Assembly on the 3rd of February and an act of parliament on the 6th of February ordered its use in every church, and henceforth, though there was no act setting aside the Book of Common Order, the Westminster Directory was of primary authority. The Directory was meant simply to make known the general heads, the sense and scope of the Prayers and other parts of Public Worship, and if need be, to give a help and furniture. The act of parliament recognizing the Directory was annulled at the Restoration and the book has never since been acknowledged by a civil authority in Scotland. But General Assemblies have frequently recommended its use, and worship in Presbyterian churches is largely conducted on the lines of the Westminster Assembly's Directory. The subsequent Book of Common Order or Euchologion was a compilation drawn from various sources and issued by the Church Service Society, an organisation which endeavoured to promote liturgical usages within the Church of Scotland. Twentieth century The Church of Scotland published revised editions of the Book of Common Order in 1940, 1979 and 1994. There are considerable differences between these three editions. The 1994 edition (now known simply as Common Order) attempts to use inclusive language and has deliberately moved away from the use of archaic language; there is even a prayer for space research. In 1996 the Church of Scotland published \\"Leabhar Sheirbheisean\\", a Gaelic supplement to the Book of Common Order.

Rudenko was a follower of Paul Broca's \\"French School\\" of anthropology. He participated in the Russian Geographical Society's (IRGO) Map Commission established in 1910. In that year he participated in an expedition to the Ob River basin in Western Siberia, where he studied the Khanty people. In 1917 he was a founder participant in the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia (KIPS), along with several colleagues of the IRGO Map Commission. Rudenko delivered lectures in the Leningrad University from 1921 to 1954. In 1947-1950 and 1954 he was sent by the Soviet Archaeology Institute to explore the kurgans in the Altay Mountains. During the excavation of Pazyryk tombs, he discovered the world's most spectacular tattooed mummy. In deference to the work of Rudenko and his anthropological usage, what was found is now said to belong to the Pazyryk Culture which flourished between the 7th and 3rd centuries BC. Herodotus and other ancient writers referred to the Altay as \\"the golden mountain\\". It was there that the impregnable citadel of the Scythians (or Sacae) lay hidden for centuries. Rudenko, however, was cautious enough not to assign his findings to the Scythians. He attributed the kurgan finds to the formidable Iron Age horsemen and warriors, whom he dubbed the \\"Pazyryks\\". Although they left no written records, Pazyryk artifacts are distinguished by a sophisticated level of artistry and craftsmanship. The Pazyryk tombs discovered by Rudenko were in an almost perfect state of preservation. They contained skeletons and intact bodies of horses and embalmed humans, together with a wealth of artifacts including saddles, riding gear, a chariot, rugs, clothing, jewelry, musical instruments, amulets, tools, and an \\"apparatus for inhaling hemp smoke\\". Also found in the tombs were fabrics from Persia and China, which the Pazyryks must have obtained on journeys covering thousands of miles. References *S.I.

Lindholme is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is situated in close proximity to Hatfield and Moorland prisons History The site was originally constructed as RAF Lindholme during the Second World War to house and operate bombers. During the RAF station's lifetime it was home to the RAF Bomber Command Bombing School (BCBS) and also the RAF Navigation School. BCBS moved out in 1972, and RAF Lindholme became a radar installation with its hangars converted for storage, eventually being downgraded to a relief glider landing field and closing altogether shortly thereafter. The site, which occupies , re-opened as a prison in 1985. Many of the original buildings and hangars from the RAF station are still in use as prison accommodation, offices and workshops, although these have been augmented by new buildings. In 2000, the old RAF Officers' Mess building, which had been used as a Category D prison wing, was converted into an Immigration Removal Centre. The annual budget for running Lindholme was ¬£18.3 million in 2011-12, and the cost per prisoner for 2010 was ¬£32,757. This budget does not include the costs of providing educational facilities or healthcare, which are separately funded. On 14 July 2011, it was announced that the operation of HMP Lindholme would be put out to tender, accepting bids from private companies and HM Prison Service for the management of the establishment. Serco were about to be awarded the contract, but the decision was postponed in July 2013, to allow allegations that they had been overcharging and mismanaging other contracts within the public sector to be investigated. In November 2013 it was announced that HMP Lindholme along with the two other contested sites in South Yorkshire, HMP Hatfield and HMP Moorland, would remain in the public sector, ending two years of uncertainty. In April 2012, the Immigration Removal Centre was closed and converted back to a Category D prison wing. In June 2013 an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons was strongly critical of the Category D wing, and it was subsequently closed. The report also stated that there were religious tensions at the prison, illegal drugs and alcohol were widely available, and that the needs of disabled inmates were neglected. However the report concluded that much of the training for prisoners was of good quality, and that vocational courses in construction and baking were \\"outstanding\\". Lindholme today Lindholme holds Category C male prisoners only. This category is for people who are unlikely to make a serious attempt to escape from prison, but who could not be trusted in an open prison. The prison holds Category C convicted males over the age of 21, who are serving a minimum sentence of four years, and used to hold a small number of Category D males, who were awaiting allocation to an open prison. However, the D wing was closed in 2013 because of poor care and medical issues. The prison has an Operational Capacity of 1,010 inmates, and this number is also the Certified National Accommodation rating for the prison, which is the uncrowded capacity that provides a decent standard of accommodation for all prisoners. The prison is run by the public sector prison service, but educational services are provided by the City of Manchester College for Learning and Skills, and healthcare is provided by Nottingham NHS Trust. The Category C site consists of eleven wings, six of which were dormitories when the site was owned by the RAF, but which also provide some single rooms and some multi-occupancy rooms. Three wings are relatively new additions to the prison and are single cell occupancy. A further new wing opened in November 2007 with double cells, which is used to hold prisoners who are at risk from bullying and intimidation. The Induction Unit has double cells, and a purpose built Care and Separation Unit was built in 2008. Every year from 2009 to 2012, the state of the kitchens had been criticised in the Independent Monitoring Board annual report. Construction of a new kitchen costing ¬£7 million was completed in April 2013, but the power supply to it was inadequate, and it was closed until 23 November, while this was rectified, at extra cost. This oversight led the Independent Monitoring Board to question how such contracts are awarded, and whether the prison service gets value for money. The 2014 report also commended the dedication of the catering staff, for their production of good quality food and their accommodation of dietary needs during religious festivals. The prison education department offers inmates opportunities to study for qualifications such as NVQs, GCSEs and A Levels in subjects including English, mathematics, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), information technology, business administration, graphic design, reprographics and printing, visual art, catering, baking, hospitality, hairdressing and barbering, industrial cleaning, construction industry training in trowel trades, plastering, painting and decorating, carpentry, plumbing, civil engineering, fork lift training, light engineering, railway engineering, horticulture, waste management, textiles, and a range of PE courses.

Etymology  Nihari comes from the Urdu word nihar () which originated from the Arabic nahaar (), meaning \\"morning\\". It was originally eaten by Nawabs in the Mughal Empire as a breakfast item after their Islamic morning prayer (salah) of Fajr. After a hearty breakfast of Nihari, the Nawabs would take a nap till afternoon, when they would wake up for afternoon prayers. History =Precursors= According to the Sushruta Samhita, lightly spiced meat broth using vida salt, zeera and asafoetida was highly rated in ancient India. =Modern dish= According to many sources, Nihari either originated in Hyderabad or Old Delhi in the late 18th century during the last throes of the Mughal Empire or in the royal kitchens of Awadh, in modern-day Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. Nihari developed with the overall cuisine of Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It has been an old popular delicacy in parts of Bangladesh, particularly Dhaka and Chittagong. People cooked it for one whole night and they got it in the early morning at sunrise. The dish is known for its spiciness and taste. It was originally more of a delicacy with myriad variations on spiciness and texture. Popularity Nihari is a traditional dish of Muslims of Delhi, Bhopal and Lucknow. After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, many Urdu speaking Muslims from northern India migrated to Karachi and Dhaka, and established restaurants. In Karachi, Nihari became a roaring success and soon all over Pakistan. Now Nihari is available in Pakistani restaurants around the world. Beef Nihari Karachi style, Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia - garnished with julienne ginger, coriander leaves and green chillies In some restaurants, a few kilos from each day's leftover Nihari is added to the next day's pot.

Ferrellgas has corporate operations in the Kansas City suburbs of Liberty, Missouri and Overland Park, Kansas. History The Ferrell family poses inside the A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company office in Atchison, Kansas. The company was founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the business prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, was active in the family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri. A.C. and Mabel's oldest son and middle child, current company Chairman James Ferrell, enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1958. That same year he married a 19-year-old freshman from nearby Benedictine College named Elizabeth (Zibbie). James Ferrell graduated from college in 1963 with a business degree. As an undergraduate, he participated in R.O.T.C.. After graduation, he went to Fort Benning, Georgia, to attend infantry school. After being stationed for a year in Korea, James and Zibbie Ferrell moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was there in 1965 that James received a letter from A.C. Ferrell asking him to return home to Kansas to help the struggling family business. The company had reverted to selling strictly propane and had dwindled to only four employees. James Ferrell renamed the company Ferrellgas. The company expanded across the Missouri River to acquire a Rushville, Missouri dealer in 1968. In the next 10 years, the company acquired other Midwestern dealers and established a wholesale operation, and profited amid the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. During that time, the Ferrellgas headquarters shifted, moving first to Platte City, Missouri before moving further east to Kearney. Its expansion continued, opening Ferrell North America, a propane and feedstock distribution arm, in 1977. To accommodate a growing staff, new offices were constructed in Liberty, Missouri, in 1981 and 1983. Those offices, which remain in use by corporate support employees today, would serve as Ferrellgas' headquarters until 2004, with the company moved its executive offices to their current location in nearby Overland Park, Kansas. =Purchase of Buckeye Gas Products Company makes Ferrellgas a nationwide company= Ferrellgas wasn't the only propane company in the nation's heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another such propane retailer was Buckeye Gas Products Company. Buckeye traced its roots to 1886, when Standard Oil Company formed the Buckeye Pipeline Co. to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern Ohio. By the 1940s, the company was supplying refineries from Chicago to Buffalo, and following World War II, it expanded its pipeline network into New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 1964, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired Buckeye, since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad‚Äôs right-of-way across the Mid- Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 when the nation‚Äôs freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive. Three years later, in 1971, the merged Penn Central Railroad filed for the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in American history. Buckeye, meanwhile, remained one of the bankrupt railroad‚Äôs more profitable subsidiaries. In the 1970s, the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure, and in 1977, Buckeye expanded into New England with the acquisition of the pipeline company Jet Lines, Inc. In 1986, Penn Central created a master limited partnership to spin off Buckeye and hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to act as lead underwriter. The planned offering did not go well, and Goldman advised management that the placement would go better if Buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately. A Wall Street banker who James Ferrell met in the early 1980s, who would later become a member of the Ferrellgas Board of Directors, Andy Levison, contacted James Ferrell in 1984 to let him know that Buckeye‚Äôs propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated $200 million and asked if he wanted to bid on it. The purchase would elevate Ferrellgas from a regional company to the country's third largest retail propane marketer. =The initial public offering= With the acquisition of Buckeye safely under its belt, Ferrellgas spent the late 1980s and early 1990s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory. The November 30, 1989 acquisition of DuPane Gas Service operations in Rhode Island was especially exciting. DuPane Gas served 2,600 Rhode Island customers with 1.7 million gallons of propane a year. It gave Ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative Northeast market. Ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in 1990 and 1991. In the latter year, the company closed 14 acquisitions ranging from the 3.9 million gallons sold by United Cities Propane Gas in Georgia to the 86,000 gallons retailed by Fessler Mill & Hardware in Wisconsin. The company continued its penetration into the Northeast with major acquisitions in New Jersey and Rhode Island. The need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave James Ferrell the idea to form a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). In June 1994, Ferrellgas issued partnership units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FGP. =Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) formed= In 1998, investment bank Goldman Sachs brought James Ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement. The idea was for Ferrell to sell his interest in Ferrellgas to the company's employees in a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. The plans helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees. On July 18, 1998, thousands of Ferrellgas employees gathered in 35 meetings across the United States to learn they had become owners of the company through the establishment of the ESOP. Ferrell appeared in a videotaped presentation to introduce the concept. Growth through acquisitions continued in the new millennium. On December 1, 2002 Ferrellgas purchased the propane operations of ProAm, Inc., then the nation's 17th largest propane retailer, for $25.6 million and a $10 million deferred seller note. The regional company had 70,000 customers and 57 retail outlets in seven states, the largest concentration of these being in Georgia and Texas. Late 2003 and early 2004 were highlighted by the acquisitions of Aeropres Propane of Bossier City, Louisiana, and Suburban Propane Partners's operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. Aeropres operated 13 locations and sold 10 million gallons of propane throughout Louisiana and Arkansas. The acquisition of the Suburban locations added 13 million gallons and allowed Ferrellgas to enter Norman, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas, for the first time. =Ferrellgas announces merger agreement With Blue Rhino= Blue Rhino propane grill tank On February 9, 2004, Ferrellgas announced its blockbuster merger with Blue Rhino Corporation, the nation's largest provider of propane by portable tank exchange founded by James Liautaud. Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrellgas purchased shares of Blue Rhino (the company was traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol RINO) in a transaction worth approximately $340 million. On the day of the merger agreement, James Ferrell called tank exchange the fastest growing portion of the retail propane industry. In 2004 the company had a nationwide exchange network of 29,000 selling locations. That number has since grown to more than 45,000 selling locations. Blue Rhino was founded in 1994, around the same time of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.'s initial public offering, and remains headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Known mostly for its exchange of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, as well as patio heaters, outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels. In September 2009, James E. Ferrell stepped down as CEO and appointed Steve Wambold, a ten-year company veteran who had served as the company's president and COO since 2005. Ferrell was appointed Interim President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2016 when Wambold stepped down from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board. =Blue Rhino propane plant explosion= At the Blue Rhino propane plant (LP gas), owned by Ferrellgas, located in Tavares, Florida in Lake County, a fire broke out at around 10:30 p.m EDT on July 29, 2013. This fire lead to multiple explosions within an hour and into the early morning of the next day. The plant contained about 53,000 20-pound propane cylinders and multiple large storage tanks. A total of eight workers were injured, some critically. =Ferrellgas diversifies with establishment of midstream division= On May 1, 2014, Ferrellgas established a midstream division with the purchase of Sable Environmental, LLC and a related entity for $124.7 million. Sable is a privately held fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas. Ferrellgas expanded its midstream operations on September 2, 2014, with the purchase of two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford Shale region from C&E; Production, LLC and its affiliates, based in Bryan, Texas. The acquisition increased Ferrellgas' salt water disposal wells in the region to eight. =Acquisition of Bridger Logistics= In June 2015, Ferrellgas agreed to acquire Bridger Logistics LLC for a fee of around $837.5 million as part of its plans to expand its midstream services business. Ownership Although publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994, the Ferrell family maintains a presence with the company. James E. Ferrell continues to serve as the company's chairman, and has twice been elected president of the World LP Gas Association. As of October 31, 2017, James E. Ferrell directly or beneficially owned 4,763,475 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Ferrellgas employees indirectly own 22,529,361 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. through an employee stock ownership plan. Approximately 69 million common units are held by public unitholders. On December 30, 2019, the company de-listed its FGP symbol from the NYSE and listed its public shares on the OTCQB Pink Sheet exchange with the symbol FGPR. This change was necessitated because the average closing price of the company‚Äôs common stock over a consecutive 30-day trading period had remained less than $1.00, which is an NYSE listing requirement. Locations Sumpter Twp., MIalt= According to the 10-K filed by the company on September 28, 2017, Ferrellgas has 789 retail locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in addition to Blue Rhino locations in Puerto Rico.

The film is based on the true story of Derek Bentley. The true story of the case ended with Bentley hanged for murder under controversial circumstances on 28 January 1953. While Bentley did not directly play a role in the murder of PC Sidney Miles, he received a greater punishment than the gunman (who was 16). Plot summary Derek Bentley (Eccleston) is an illiterate, epileptic young adult with developmental disabilities who falls into a gang led by a younger teenager named Christopher Craig (Reynolds). During the course of the robbery of a warehouse in Croydon, in which Bentley is encouraged to participate by Craig, the two become trapped by the police. Officers order Craig to put down his gun. Bentley, who by this time has already been arrested, shouts \\"Let him have it, Chris\\" - whether he means the phrase literally (\\"Let him have the gun\\") or figuratively (\\"Open fire!\\") is unclear. Craig fires, killing one officer and wounding another. Because he is a minor, Craig is given a prison sentence for the crime. Meanwhile, Bentley is sentenced to death under the English common law principle of joint enterprise, on the basis that his statement to Craig was an instigation to shoot. Bentley's family makes an effort for clemency which reaches Parliament. However, the Home Secretary (who has the power to commute the death sentence) declines to intervene. Despite his family's efforts and some public support, Bentley is executed in 1953 within a month of being convicted, before Parliament takes any official action.

Seven years after the film was made and after numerous unsuccessful campaigns to get Derek Bentley a full pardon, his conviction was eventually overturned by the Court of Appeal on 30 July 1998, one year after Iris's death. Reception The film gained positive reviews from critics. It holds an 84% approval rating from the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Led by a gripping performance from Christopher Eccleston, Let Him Have It sounds a compelling call for justice on behalf of its real-life protagonist.\\" Tom Wiener said that the film displayed the writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade's \\"outrage toward a system hell-bent on vengeance\\" and John Ivan Simon called the script \\"first rate, no nonsense\\".

First run in 1978 and held annually since 1980, it features a flat, fast course which saw nearly 20 percent of finishers qualify for the Boston Marathon in 2010. The event has sold-out in mid-August the past eight years. There are 7,000 runners in the full marathon and 11,000 in the half marathon, making it one of the largest running events in the United States. Proceeds go to Nationwide Children's Hospital. 2018 marks the seventh year of this partnership; so far $7 million has been raised for the Hospital. This includes more than $800,000 contributed since 2012 by the Columbus Marathon Board of Directors. History The concept of the Columbus Marathon was the brainchild of former Mayors Tom Moody and Greg Lashutka as a way to put Columbus on the map and showcase the city at the same time. The inaugural race was held on June 4, 1978. The 1980 race, on November 16, hosted 2,500 runners. Tommy Persson of Sweden set a course record of 2:11:02 that year which remains unbroken (as of 2017). The 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants automatically receiving full refunds.https://web.archive.org/web/20200701150625/https://www.columbusmarathon.com/ Course The cloverleaf design of the course also makes it easy for spectators to see their athletes at several different points ‚Äì all within a block walking distance. The course begins in downtown Columbus and takes athletes east through Bexley, Ohio, past the Governor's Mansion and Capital University; back through the festive neighborhood of Old Town East; south through German Village; up High Street through downtown Columbus and the Short North Arts District; a jaunt through the Ohio State University, including past The Oval and through Ohio Stadium, home of the football Buckeyes, and through Upper Arlington, through the tree-lined streets of Victorian Village and back to a huge crowd awaiting finishers outside Nationwide Arena in the Arena District.

The Columbus Marathon has affected Columbus and Central Ohio. More than 250,000 runners have come from 37 countries and all 50 states to participate in the Columbus Marathon. The Columbus Marathon is also one of the last qualifying marathons before registration opens for the Boston Marathon. Olympics qualification More than 50 Olympians have run in Columbus, including the 1980 men's Silver Medalist, Gerard , 1984 Women's Gold Medalist, Joan Benoit, 1984 Men's Fourth Place Finisher, Joseph Nzau and 1984 Women's 6th Place Finisher, Priscilla Welch. In 1983, seven women qualified for the Women's U.S. Olympic Trials event, six of them were from the state of Ohio. The top 10 males also qualified for their Olympic Trials events. Seven of them men ran in the 1984 Olympics for their respective countries. The following year, eight Olympians competed in the Columbus Marathon. In 1992, 109 of the country's top runners came to Columbus. Only 3 would qualify for the team and their quest for a medal at the Summer Olympics: Steve Spence, Ed Eyestone, and Bob Kempainen. Since then, more and more athletes have come to Columbus to qualify for the Olympic Marathon Trials.

The primate is Francisco Moreno, Bishop of Northern Mexico. The shield of the denomination uses the colors representing Mexico as well as those of the Episcopal Church (US) recognizing its historical connection with the US church. History The 17th-century former Convento San Jos√© de Gracia now serves as the Anglican Cathedral of Mexico The Anglican Church of Mexico can trace its roots to the Mexican War for independence in 1810, and to the attempt in 1854 by several liberal minded priests who later supported the liberal Constitution of 1857 (for this reason they became known as ‚ÄúConstitutionalist Fathers‚Äù) to reform the local Roman Catholic Church, but it was the Reform War that led to the foundation of the Church. Religious reforms in 1857 secured freedom of religion, separating the Roman Catholic Church from government and politics. In 1860, the newly formed Church of Jesus contacted the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, seeking Apostolic Succession. In 1879, the first bishop, H. Chauncey Riley, was consecrated. In 1958, the fourth missionary bishop of Mexico Jos√© G. Saucedo was the first of the Church's bishops to be consecrated on Mexican soil, being the de facto leader of the Mexican Church for the second half of the twentieth century leading the process for it to become an autonomous Province of the Anglican Communion on 1 January 1995, and being elected its first Primate Archbishop. Membership Today, there are 52 Anglican parishes in Mexico, 36 missions, and 12 other affiliated institutions. Structure Map of dioceses of Anglican Church of Mexico (Green: Northern; Red: Western; Yellow: Southeastern; White: Mexico; Blue: Cuernavaca) The polity of the Anglican Church of Mexico is episcopal, as is true of all other Anglican churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses. There are 5 of these, each headed by a bishop. Each diocese is divided into archdeaconries, each headed by a senior priest. The archdeaconries are further subdivided into parishes, headed by a parish priest. Several of the dioceses are named in Spanish merely for a compass direction ‚Äî del Occindente, del Norte, del Sureste ‚Äî which translate directly as \\"of the West\\" &c.;La Iglesia Anglicana de M√©xico ‚Äî Nosotros (Accessed 20 May 2018) However, the Episcopal Church and other English-language Anglican Communion sources instead render these names with \\"Mexico\\" ‚Äî e.g. \\"of Western Mexico\\" ‚Äî so these are the forms used on the English-language Wikipedia. =Diocese of Mexico= In 1879, diocesan bishop Henry C. Riley was ordained and consecrated by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America as \\"Bishop of the Valley of Mexico\\", to exercise oversight over the Mexican \\"Church of Jesus\\". Riley resigned in 1884 and the care of the independent church lapsed to the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church. Henry Forrester, the church's local administrator, was elected Bishop of the Valley of Mexico, but died before consecration. In 1904, the Episcopal Church formed all of the Mexican Republic into one Missionary District of Mexico, for North American Anglicans/Episcopalians in Mexico;Episcopal News Service archives ‚Äî Romero, Saucedo Consecrated; March 6, 1964 (Accessed 20 May 2018) and which the native Church of Jesus joined in 1906.La Iglesia Anglicana de Mexico (IAM) ‚Äî Historical Preface (Accessed 20 May 2018)Anglican Diocese of Southeastern M√©xico ‚Äî Historic Summary (Archived from the original on 29 August 2009 and accessed 20 May 2018) That year, Henry D.

In 2016, the General Synod of the church published a pronouncement declaring itself to be against all forms of violence and discrimination against migrants, victims of violence, or the LGBTI community. Doctrine and practice The center of the Anglican Church of Mexico's teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, includes: *Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead. *Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe. *The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people \\"under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\\". The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine. *The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist *Other sacramental rites are confirmation, ordination, marriage, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction. *Belief in heaven and hell as states of being, and Jesus's return in glory. The threefold sources of authority in Anglicanism are scripture, tradition, and reason. These three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.Anglican Listening Detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to \\"uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way\\". = Ecumenical relations = Unlike many other Anglican churches, the Anglican Church of Mexico is not a member of the ecumenical World Council of Churches.http://www.oikoumene.org/?id=3587 World Council of Churches The denomination maintains ecumenical dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox churches. The Anglican Church of Mexico considers itself to be a part of the Global Center seeking to reconcile the divide between conservative and liberal provinces in the Anglican Communion while respecting diversity of opinion and practice.

In Old Norse sources, such as sagas and runestones, Serkland (also S√¶rkland, Srklant, Sirklant, Serklat, etc.) was the \\"land of the Serkir\\", usually identified with the Saracens. The exact etymology is disputed. Serk- may derive from \\"Saracen\\"; from sericum, Latin for \\"silk\\", implying a connection with the Silk Road; from the Khazar fortress of Sarkel; or from serkr, shirt or gown, i.e., \\"land of the gown-wearers\\". In all cases it refers to a land in the East. Originally, it referred to the land south of the Caspian Sea, but it gradually expanded to cover all Islamic lands, including in Africa (and possibly even Muslim Sicily).Judith Jesch, Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse (Boydell, 2001), p. 104ff.Stefan Brink, \\"People and land in Early Scandinavia\\", in Ildar H.

It is treated as a letter of its own in Chamorro, Old Spanish, Czech, Slovak, Igbo, Kazakh, Uzbek, Quechua, Guarani, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, and Belarusian ≈Åacinka alphabets. In Vietnamese and Modern Spanish, it also used to be considered a letter for collation purposes but this is no longer common.  History  The digraph was first used in Latin since the 2nd century B.C. to transliterate the sound of the Greek letter chi in words borrowed from that language. In classical times, Greeks pronounced this as an aspirated voiceless velar plosive . In post- classical Greek (Koine and Modern) this sound developed into a fricative . Since neither sound was found in native Latin words (with some exceptions like pulcher 'beautiful', where the original sound was influenced by or ), in Late Latin the pronunciation occurred. In Old French, a language that had no or and represented by c, k, or qu, ch began to be used to represent the voiceless palatal plosive , which came from in some positions and later became and then . Now the digraph ch is used for all the aforementioned sounds, as shown below. The Old French usage of ch was also a model of several other digraphs for palatals or postalveolars: lh (digraph), nh (digraph), sh (digraph).  Use by language  Pronunciation of written ch in European languages. Dark grey denotes the area where ch denotes more than one pronunciations. = Balto-Slavic languages = In Balto-Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillic alphabet, ch represents the voiceless velar fricative . Ch is used in the Lithuanian language to represent the \\"soft h\\" , in word choras [Ààx…îr…êsÃ™] \\"choir\\". This digraph is not considered a single letter in the Lithuanian alphabet. This digraph is used only in loanwords. \\"Ch\\" represents in Upper Sorbian.  Czech  The letter ch is a digraph consisting of the sequence of Latin alphabet graphemes C and H, however it is a single phoneme (pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative ) and represents a single entity in Czech collation order, inserted between H and I. In capitalized form, Ch is used at the beginning of a sentence (Chechtal se. \\"He giggled.\\"), while CH or Ch can be used for standalone letter in lists etc. and only fully capitalized CH is used when the letter is a part of an abbreviation (e.g. CHKO Beskydy) and in all-uppercase texts. In Czech alphabet, the digraph Ch is handled as a letter equal to other letters. In Czech dictionaries, indexes, and other alphabetical lists, it has its own section, following that of words (including names) beginning with H and preceding that of words that begin with I. Thus, the word chemie will not be found in the C section of a Czech dictionary, nor the name Chalupa in the C section of the phonebook. The alphabetical order h ch is observed also when the combination ch occurs in median or final position: Praha precedes Prachatice, hod precedes hoch.  Polish  Ch has been used in the Polish language to represent the \\"soft h\\" as it is pronounced in the Polish word chleb \\"bread\\", and the h to represent \\"hard h\\", where it is distinct, as it is pronounced in the Polish word hak \\"hook\\". Between World War I and World War II, the Polish intelligentsia used to exaggerate the \\"hardness\\" of the hard Polish h to aid themselves in proper spelling. In most present-day Polish dialects, however, ch and h are uniformly collapsed as . Slovak In Slovak, ch represents , and more specifically in voiced position. At the beginning of a sentence it is used in two different variants: CH or Ch. It can be followed by a consonant (chladn√Ω \\"cold\\"), a vowel (ch√©mia \\"chemistry\\") or diphthong (chiazmus \\"chiasmus\\"). Only few Slovak words treat CH as two separate letters, e.g., viachlasn√Ω (e.g. \\"multivocal\\" performance), from viac (\\"multi\\") and hlas (\\"voice\\"). In the Slovak alphabet, it comes between H and I. = Celtic languages = In Goidelic languages, ch represents the voiceless velar fricative . In Irish, ch stands for when broad and (or between vowels) when slender. Examples: broad in chara \\"friend\\" (lenited), loch \\"lake, loch\\", boichte \\"poorer\\"; slender in Ch√©adaoin \\"Wednesday\\" (lenited), deich \\"ten\\". Breton has evolved a modified form of this digraph, c'h for representing , as opposed to ch, which stands for . In Welsh ch represents the voiceless uvular fricative . The digraph counts as a separate letter in the Welsh alphabet, positioned after c and before d; so, for example, chwilen 'beetle' comes after cymryd 'take' in Welsh dictionaries; similarly, Tachwedd 'November' comes after taclus 'tidy'. = Chamorro = Ch is the fifth letter of the Chamorro language and its sound is . The Chamorro Language has three different dialects - the Guamanian dialect, the Northern Mariana Islands dialect, and the Rotanese dialect. With the minor difference in dialect, the Guamanians have a different orthography from the other two dialects. In Guamanian orthography, both letters tend to get capitalized (eg.: CHamoru). The Northern Mariana Islands' & Rotanese orthography enforces the standard capitalization rule (eg.: Chamorro). = Germanic languages = In several Germanic languages, including German and Yiddish, ch represents the voiceless velar fricative . In Rheinische Dokumenta, ch represents , as opposed to _ch_ , which stands for .  Dutch  Dutch ch was originally voiceless, while g was voiced. In the northern Netherlands, both ch and g are voiceless, while in the southern Netherlands and Flanders the voiceless/voiced distinction is upheld. The voiceless fricative is pronounced [x] or [œá] in the north and [√ß] in the south, while the voiced fricative is pronounced […£] in the north (i.e. the northern parts of the area that still has this distinction) and [ ù] in the south. This difference of pronunciation is called 'hard and soft g'.  English  In English, ch is most commonly pronounced as , as in chalk, cheese, cherry, church, much, etc. Ch can also be pronounced as , as in ache, choir, school and stomach. Most words with this pronunciation of ch find their origin in Greek words with the letter chi, like mechanics, chemistry and character. Others, like chiaroscuro, scherzo and zucchini, come from Italian. In English words of French origin, \\"ch\\" represents , as in charade, machine, and nonchalant. Due to hypercorrection, this pronunciation also occurs in a few loanwords from other sources, like machete (from Spanish) and pistachio (from Italian). In certain dialects of British English ch is often pronounced in two words: sandwich and spinach, and also in place names, such as Greenwich and Norwich. In words of Scots origin it may be pronounced as (or ), as in loch and clachan. In words of Hebrew or Yiddish origin it may be pronounced as (or ). The digraph can also be silent, as in Crichton, currach, drachm, yacht and traditionally in schism.  German  In German, ch normally represents two allophones: the voiceless velar fricative (or ) following a, o or u (called Ach-Laut), and the voiceless palatal fricative following any other vowel or a consonant (called Ich-Laut). A similar allophonic variation is thought to have existed in Old English. The sequence \\"chs\\" is normally pronounced , as in sechs (six) and Fuchs (fox). An initial \\"ch\\" (which only appears in loaned and dialectical words) may be pronounced (common in southern varieties), (common in western varieties) or (common in northern and western varieties). It is always pronounced when followed by l or r, as in Christus (Christ) or Chlor (chlorine).  Swedish  In Swedish, ch represents /…ß/ and /…ï/ in loanwords such as choklad and check. These sounds come from former [ É] and [t É], respectively. In the conjunction och (and), ch is pronounced [k] or silent. =Hungarian= The digraph ch is not properly speaking part of the Hungarian alphabet, but it has historically been used for [t É], as in English and Spanish (as with Szechenyi family name), and is found in a few words of Greek or other foreign origin, such as technik, where it is pronounced the same as h, somewhat as in Polish. =Interlingua= In Interlingua, ch is pronounced / É/ in words of French origin (e.g. 'chef' = / Éef/ meaning \\"chief\\" or \\"chef\\"), /k/ in words of Greek and Italian origin (e.g. \\"choro\\" = /koro/ meaning \\"chorus\\"), and more rarely /tÕ° É/ in words of English or Spanish origin (e.g. \\"cochi\\" /kotÕ° Éi/ meaning \\"car\\" or \\"coach\\"). Ch may be pronounced either /tÕ° É/ or / É/ depending on the speaker in many cases (e.g. \\"chocolate\\" may be pronounced either /tÕ° Éokolate/ or / Éokolate/). = Romance languages = In Catalan ch represents final sound. In the past it was widely used, but nowadays it is only used in some surnames. In medieval Catalan it was occasionally used to represent sound. In native French words, ch represents as in chanson (song). In most words of Greek origin, it represents as in arch√©ologie, ch≈ìur, chirographier; but chimie, chirurgie, and chim√®re have , as does anarchiste. In Italian, ch represents the voiceless velar plosive before -e and -i. In Occitan, ch represents , but in some dialects it is .  Ibero-Romance  In Portuguese, ch represents . Ch is pronounced as a voiceless postalveolar affricate in both Castillian and Latin American Spanish, or a voiceless postalveolar fricative in Andalusian. Ch is traditionally considered a distinct letter of the Spanish alphabet, called che. In the 2010 Orthography of the Spanish Language, Ch is no longer considered a letter of its own but rather a digraph consisting of two letters. Until 1994 ch was treated as a single letter in Spanish collation order, inserted between C and D; in this way, mancha was after manco and before manda. However, an April 1994 vote in the 10th Congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies adopted the standard international collation rules, so ch is now considered a sequence of two distinct characters, and dictionaries now place words starting with ch- between those starting with cg- and ci-.Association of Spanish Language Academies, official website Similarly, mancha now precedes manco in alphabetical order. =Kazakh= Ch was selected to represent in the Kazakh Latin alphabet. It was considered a separate letter, and was the 32nd and last letter of the alphabet in the 2018 amendment. As part of the switch of Kazakh from Cyrillic to Latin, the initial proposed Latin alphabet in 2017 (implemented by Presidential Decree 569 of 26 October 2017) tried to avoid the use of accent marks and digraphs in representing certain phonemes. Initially, /tÕ°…ï/ would have been represented by ‚ü®C'‚ü©. This was revised by Presidential Decree 637 of 19 February 2018, replacing the apostrophe with the digraph ‚ü®Ch‚ü©.Decree No. 637 of February 19, 2018 However, in the late 2019, under president Tokayev's amendment suggestions, the Ch has replaced by √á in order to keep compatibility with other Turkic languages. =Other languages= Ch was used in the Massachusett orthography developed by John Eliot to represent a sound similar to and in the modern orthography in use by some Wampanoag tribes for the same sound. In both systems, the digraph ch is considered a single letter. In the Ossetic Latin alphabet, ch was used to write the sound []. In Palauan, ch represents a glottal stop . Ch represents [] in Uyghur Latin script. Ch represents in the Uzbek alphabet. It is considered a separate letter, and is the 28th letter of the alphabet. In Vietnamese, ch represents the voiceless palatal plosive in the initial position. In the final position, the pronunciation is identical to the final -k: . In Xhosa and Zulu, ch represents the voiceless aspirated velar dental click .  Use in romanization  \\"Ch\\" is frequently used in transliterating into many European languages from Greek, Hebrew, Yiddish, and various others. In Mandarin Chinese ch is used in Pinyin to represent an aspirated voiceless retroflex affricate . Alternate representations International Morse code provides a unitary code for Ch used in several non-English languages, namely ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî. In the Czech extension to Braille the letter Ch is represented as the dot pattern ‚†ª. English literary braille also has a single cell dedicated to (dots 1‚Äì6), which stands for \\"child\\" in isolation, but this is considered a single-cell contraction rather than a separate letter. In English Braille, the \\"ch\\" digraph, when pronounced as , is represented by a single cell: In computing, Ch is represented as a sequence of C and H, not as a single character; only the historical KOI-8 ƒåS2 encoding contained Ch as a single character.

The diagonal line bisecting the larger, left-hand parallelogram appears to be considerably longer than the diagonal line bisecting the smaller, right-hand parallelogram, but is the same length. One possible reason for this illusion is that the diagonal lines around the blue lines give a perception of depth, and when the blue lines are included in that depth, they are perceived as different lengths.

Serving as the administrative center of Lubny Raion (district), the city itself is administratively incorporated as a city of oblast significance and does not belong to the raion. Population: 45,275. History Lubny is reputed to be one of the oldest cities in Ukraine, allegedly founded in 988 by knyaz (prince) Vladimir the Great (Volodymyr) of Kyiv. The first written record, however, dates from 1107. Initially, it was a small wooden fortress above the Sula River. The fortress quickly grew, and in the 15th or 16th century, it was owned by the powerful Wisniowiecki family. The town was ruled by Magdeburg rights and had a coat of arms. In 1596, Lubny was the site of the last battle of Severyn Nalyvaiko against the Poles. In the 17th century the city was one of the largest in the area. In 1638 it had 2,646 inhabitants. After Khmelnytsky Uprising, between 1648 and 1781, the town was the headquarters of the Lubny Cossack Regiment. In 1782 Lubny became an uyezd center of Kiev Viceroyalty, in 1793 the town was included into Malorossiya Governorate, since 1802 - into Poltava Governorate–õ—É–±–Ω—ã // –ë–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è. / —Ä–µ–¥–∫–æ–ª–ª., –≥–ª. —Ä–µ–¥. –ë. –ê. –í–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π. 2-–µ –∏–∑–¥. —Ç–æ–º 25. –ú., –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ ¬´–ë–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è¬ª, 1954. —Å—Ç—Ä.439 After a railroad line was constructed through Lubny in 1901, industry grew rapidly and expanded in the city.

History According to Simons, he founded the program to address failures in the US education system to produce students highly qualified in STEM skills and knowledge, which reduces America's ability to compete in the global economy. He perceived the cause of the failure as low quality teachers, and saw that problem in turn as being caused by low salaries, lack of prestige, and lack of support and good training making the job unattractive to qualified candidates, many of whom could get jobs in lucrative fields like quantitative finance. He created the program to provide math and science teachers with higher salaries and better training and funded it with $25M of his own money, adding an additional $25M in 2006. In the initial program, people who were accepted into the program who had degrees in math but were not teachers received a stipend of about $18,000 per year for five years from MfA in addition to their salaries and received free tuition to a high quality one year Master's program in teaching, as well as mentoring and professional development support after the first year. The five-year period was selected because that is the period during which most new teachers drop out; the starting salary of a NYC math teacher with a graduate degree was around $50,000 at that time. The program also offered stipends to qualified existing teachers, to promote their retention in the field. People who were accepted into the program also had to agree that they would pay back some of the support they had received, if they dropped out of the program. By 2011 MfA had expanded to science fields as well as math, and organizations had been established and funded in San Diego, Los Angeles, Berkeley, Calif., Utah, Boston, and the District of Columbia. Each site was autonomous, with its own board, fund-raising, and programs tailored to address local needs, but all coordinated with the founding organization and received funding from the Simons Foundation. It had also added two programs to support existing teachers in its New York City location: a Master Teacher Fellowship for experienced secondary school math teachers and the Early Career Fellowship for newer teachers. By 2012 the program was working with 330 teachers in the New York City schools, and due to hiring freezes in the school system, reduced the size of its new teacher program and expanded its program to provide stipends to existing teachers; it also announced that in 2013 it would expand to include science teachers and middle school teachers. That year it also started a program offering $5,000 stipends to school administrators who attended seven MfA meetings per year. Its budget before 2012 had been $20M per year and it planned to increase the budget to $30M per year to support the expansion for experienced teachers. In 2013 New York State launched a state- funded \\"Master Teacher\\" program to provide stipends to qualified existing teachers modeled on MfA's program. Ongoing financial support for MfA programs comes from private donors and government grants.

Bowen was born in Oxford, son of the chemist Edmund Bowen. He attended the Dragon School, gaining a scholarship to Rugby School and then a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. He won the Gibbs Prize in 1949 and completed a DPhil in chemistry at Oxford University in 1953 before starting his professional career as a chemist. Bowen was also a proficient amateur actor in his early years, appearing with a young Ronnie Barker at Oxford. His first post was with the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) near the village of Harwell where he lived, working at the Wantage Research Laboratory, then in Berkshire. His early work started an interest in radioisotopes and trace elements that he maintained throughout his working life. While at AERE, he spent several months in 1956 attending the British nuclear tests at Maralinga in Australia to study the environmental effects of radiation. A jar of the botanical reference material Bowen's Kale, in the collection of the Museum of the History of Science, University of Oxford, England. Bowen realised that the calibration of different instruments intended to measure trace elements was an important issue that needed addressing. His solution was to produce a good supply of a material which later become known as Bowen's Kale. With Peter Cawse, he grew a large amount of the plant kale, then dried and crushed it into a homogeneous and stable substance that he then freely distributed to researchers around the world for years to come. This was probably the first successful example of such a standard. In 1964, he was appointed as a lecturer in the chemistry department at the University of Reading. Later he was promoted to Reader in analytical chemistry in 1974. At Reading, Bowen undertook consultancy for Dunlop, investigating potential uses for their products. When the Torrey Canyon oil disaster occurred in 1967, he realised that it might be possible to use foam booms to block the oil from spreading in the English Channel. His original experiments were conducted in a small bucket in his laboratory. Although not entirely successful in reality at the time due to the rough seas, this lateral thinking combined his interest in chemistry with his love of nature and has since been effectively deployed to protect ports and harbours against encroaching oil slicks. Bowen wrote a number of professional books in the field of chemistry, including two editions of Trace elements in Biochemistry (1966 and 1976). From 1951 onwards, Bowen was a long-serving member of the Botanical Society of the British Isles (BSBI). He was meetings secretary for a period and the official recorder of plants for the counties of Berkshire and Dorset, producing Floras for both counties. He retired to Winterborne Kingston in Dorset at the end of his life. He was also one of the leading contributors of botanical data for the Flora of Oxfordshire. He acted as an expert botanical guide on tours around Europe, especially Greece. Humphry Bowen donated a large collection of lichens from Berkshire and Oxfordshire to the Museum of Reading in the 1970s. He established the Bowen Cup at the University of Reading in 1988, an annual prize for the student in the Department of Chemistry at the University who achieves the top marks in Part II Analytical Chemistry.

He was an early settler at Nashville, Tennessee and in Louisiana. He was a member of the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses and a delegate for North Carolina in the Continental Congress and a non-voting member of the U.S. House for the Southwest Territory. In historical writings, he is usually referred to as \\"Dr. James White\\" to distinguish him from General James White, the founder of Knoxville, Tennessee. White was born into a prosperous mercantile family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Anne (Willcox) and James White. His early education was at the College of St. Omer, a Jesuit school in modern-day France (then part of the Austrian Netherlands). When he returned he entered the University of Pennsylvania and studied medicine and law. After graduating he moved to the Province of North Carolina. In 1785, White was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives. In 1786, North Carolina sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress where he served until 1788. Late in 1786, Congress named him Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the southern department. After that he was frequently absent from Congress, traveling the Carolina and Georgia frontiers negotiating with the Indian tribes. After his congressional service he moved to the frontier, buying land and settling in what became Nashville, Tennessee. When the Southwest Territory's legislature was formed in 1794, White was selected as its delegate to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1794 to 1796. After Tennessee gained statehood in 1796, he returned home to Davidson County. James White was fluent in French and Spanish. In the 1780s he had become involved with John Sevier's plan to place the State of Franklin under Spanish rule. He used his position and travels as Indian superintendent to serve as agent conducting negotiations between Sevier and the governor of Spanish Louisiana. In the 1790s he was involved in William Blount's plan to work with the Indians and Britain in staging an invasion of Spanish Florida. As his role in these schemes became known, he moved to the Spanish territory of New Orleans in 1799, settling in what later became St. Martin Parish, Louisiana. While his earlier actions caused problems in Tennessee, they weren't widely known. When the United States expansion reached him again President Jefferson named him as a territorial judge in 1804, initially for the District of Louisiana, and then for the Territory of Orleans. His family prospered in Louisiana. His son, (Edward Douglass White Sr.), was Governor of Louisiana. His grandson, Edward Douglass White, served as Chief Justice of the United States. James White died at home in 1809 in St. James Parish, Louisiana.

It was started in March 1862 with thirteen Charter members, as the Scott Township mission of the Canada Presbyterian Church. The first building was opened in November 1864, on land given by George Leask. It was linked that year to Chalmer's Presbyterian Church now St. Andrew's-Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Uxbridge. After the Presbyterian Church in Canada was formed in 1875, the congregation was disjoined from Chalmer's in 1880. A preaching station was established in nearby Zephyr, Ontario, and they remained joined, until the Zephyr congregation disbanded and joined with St. Paul's in 1968. In 1906, following a period of growth, the congregation built the previous structure, and paid off the building debts by 1908. From 1910‚Äì1926, when both these congregations voted against (11‚Äì63 at St. Paul's) joining with Methodists and congregationalists to form the United Church of Canada, the minister was Rev. Ewan Macdonald, the husband of author Lucy Maud Montgomery. She wrote many of her books from the Leaskdale Manse, that was sold by the congregation in the 1990s, and is now a local museum. The congregation has seen growth in recent years, with its proximity to the Greater Toronto Area. In 2005, permission was granted to construct a new building, complete with a large gymnasium, kitchen, offices, and school rooms. It was completed and dedicated in September 2006.

The song appeared on the 1992 film soundtrack, The Bodyguard.Michelle Visage young: Strictly Come Dancing star looks completely different in old photos, Daily Express (5 August 2019) It reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, and peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 16 in the UK Singles Chart in 1993, and number 90 in Australia on the ARIA Chart in 1993. The song \\"It's Gonna Be a Lovely Day!\\" was the only song on the soundtrack performed by an artist other than Whitney Houston released as a single in the US. Visage was the recording artist by contract on this song (thus the single cover reading, \\"Introducing Michelle Visage\\") and the group was born out of a production deal for her as contracted by Clive Davis himself. Her contract included recording three albums but the entire first album was lost after completion and the contract then broken. Visage also shares a writing credit on \\"It's Gonna Be A Lovely Day!\\". The S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.'s debut album, Anything Goes!, was supposed to be released during 1993's first quarter. Per Michelle Visage, Clivill√©s + Cole failed to deliver the album's original master tapes (which was completed on early 1993) to Arista Records (for reasons that are unknown to this day). Because the master tapes of the album were never delivered to the label, Arista never issued the album and the act was soon dropped thereafter. Visage went on to become a TV and radio talk show host, along with RuPaul in NYC and on the cable channel VH1 and can be seen as a current judge on the reality competition show RuPaul's Drag Race. Lambertis went on to provide vocals for several other artists throughout the 1990s.

With bodywork and control layout recalling early-1960s Grand Prix road racing motorcycles, caf√© racers are noted for their visual minimalism, featuring low-mounted handlebars, prominent seat cowling and elongated fuel tank ‚Äì and frequently knee-grips indented in the fuel tank. Caf√© racer origins The term originated among British motorcycle enthusiasts of the early 1960s in London, specifically within the Rocker or \\"Ton-Up Boys\\" youth subculture, where the bikes were used for short, quick rides between popular caf√©s, in Watford at the Busy Bee caf√©, and the Ace Caf√© in Stonebridge, London. In post-war Britain, car ownership was still uncommon, but by the late 1950s the average Briton could afford a car, so by the early 1960s the caf√© racer's significance was that a bike had come to represent speed, status and rebellion, rather than mere inability to afford a car. In 2014, journalist Ben Stewart described the caf√© racer as a \\"look made popular when European kids stripped down their small-displacement bikes to zip from one caf√© hangout to another.\\" Writing in 1973, Wallace Wyss maintained that the term caf√© racer was originally used in Europe to describe a \\"motorcyclist who played at being an Isle of Man road racer\\" but was actually \\"someone who owned a racy machine but merely parked it near his table at the local outdoor cafe.\\" Configuration A 1962 AJS 7R 350cc race bike, with features often imitated by caf√© racers BSA Gold Star 500 caf√© racer In addition to light weight, a tuned engine and minimalist bodywork, the caf√© racer typically features distinctive ergonomics. Dropped bars that are low, narrow handlebars (called \\"clip-ons\\") ‚Äì enabled the rider to \\"tuck in\\", reducing wind resistance and improving control. Along with the rearward located seat, the posture often required rearsets, or rear-set footrests and foot controls, again typical of racing motorcycles of the era. Distinctive half or full race- style fairings were sometimes mounted to the forks or frame. John Glimmerveen declared in 2017 that the typical specification of an early caf√© racer would be: swept-back pipes, low-mounted clip-on handlebars or 'Ace' bars, reverse cone megaphone mufflers, TT100 Dunlop tires, rear sets, and larger carburetors (often with inlet trumpet rather than air filters).\\"What Is a Cafe Racer? John Glimmerveen, www.thoughtco.com 28 February 2017, archived from the original 3 January 2018. Retrieved 22 December 2019 The bikes featured minimalist styling, engines tuned for speed and responsive handling. A typical example was the \\"Triton\\", a homemade combination of a Triumph Bonneville engine in a Norton Featherbed frame. A less common hybrid was the \\"Tribsa\\" which had a Triumph engine in a BSA duplex frame. Other hybrids caf√© racers included the \\"NorVin\\" (a Vincent V-Twin engine in a Featherbed frame), and bikes with racing frames by Rickman or Seeley. Evolution 1960s Rockers outside Watford's Busy Bee Caf√© 1977 Harley-Davidson XLCR Honda GB500 TT caf√© racer Caf√© racer styling evolved throughout the time of their popularity. By the mid-1970s, Japanese bikes had overtaken British bikes in the marketplace, and the look of real Grand Prix racing bikes had changed. The hand-made, frequently unpainted aluminium racing fuel tanks of the 1960s had evolved into square, narrow, fibreglass tanks. Increasingly, three-cylinder Kawasaki two- strokes, four-cylinder four-stroke Kawasaki Z1, and four-cylinder Honda engines were the basis for caf√© racer conversions. By 1977, a number of manufacturers had taken notice of the caf√© racer boom and were producing factory caf√© racers, such as the well-received Moto Guzzi Le Mans and the Harley-Davidson XLCR. The Japanese domestic market started making cafe racer replicas in the early 1980s, first Honda with the GB250 in 1983, then GB400 and GB500 versions in 1985. The GB400TTMKII has a frame mounted fairing and single seat with cowl. The Honda GB500 TT, sought to emulate BSA and Norton caf√© racers of the 1960s. Markets outside got the XBR500 in 1985, with more angular modern styling to compete with the Yamaha SRX600, until Honda USA released a version of the GB500 in 1989. In the mid-1970s, riders continued to modify standard production motorcycles into so-called \\"caf√© racers\\" by simply equipping them with clubman bars and a small fairing around the headlight. A number of European manufacturers, including Benelli, BMW, Bultaco and Derbi produced factory \\"caf√©\\" variants of their standard motorcycles in this manner, without any modifications made to make them faster or more powerful, a trend that continues today. Modern caf√© racers Manufacturers have noticed that there is a lot of recent consumer interest in caf√© racers. While this approach was not new to the industry, manufacturers have realised the market appeal of this type of ready-to-ride caf√© racer. During the past decade, over 50% of the larger motorcycle manufacturers have adopted the trend. In 2004, Triumph produced a turn-key retro motorcycle with their Thruxton. Another modern cafe racer is the Ducati SportClassic, made from 2006 till 2009. Current stock caf√© racers from motorcycle factories include: * BMW R nineT Racer * Ducati Scrambler Caf√© Racer * Harley-Davidson XL1200CX Roadster * M√©tisse Mk5 * Moto Guzzi V7 * Norton Commando 961 Caf√© Racer * Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 * Yamaha XSR900 Abarth * Ducati Scrambler (2015) Cafe Racer * Honda CB1000R Neo- Sports Caf√© Racer Subculture Suzuki S40 customised in a caf√© racer style Rockers were a young and rebellious rock and roll subculture who wanted a fast, personalised and distinctive bike to travel between transport caf√©s along the newly built arterial motorways in and around British towns and cities. Biker lore has it that the goal of many was to be able to reach ‚Äì called simply \\"the ton ‚Äì along such a route where the rider would leave from a caf√©, race to a predetermined point and back to the caf√© before a single song could play on the jukebox, called record-racing. However, author Mike Seate contends that record-racing is a myth, the story having originated in an episode of the BBC Dixon of Dock Green television show. Caf√© racers are remembered as being especially fond of rockabilly music and their image is now embedded in today's rockabilly culture. The Caf√© Racer sub-culture has created a separate look and identity with modern caf√© racers taking style elements from American Greasers, British Rockers, 70s bikers, and modern motorcycle riders to create a global style of their own.

Early life The son of John T. Foster and Frances Nicholson, Thomas Foster was born July 24, 1852, in Lambton Mills, Ontario. His family soon moved to Leaskdale, Ontario after his mother's death. He started his working life as a butcher's boy in Toronto, until he saved enough money to purchase his own butcher shop for $50. The earnings from that business allowed him to purchase property which became the source of his eventual wealth. Political career He was first elected as an alderman for St. David Ward in 1891, then reelected in 1892 and 1894. In 1895 he lost the election, and did not return to council until 1900 as an alderman for Ward 2, a position which he held until 1909. He was elected to the Toronto Board of Control in 1910; however, he lost the 1911 election. In 1912 he was again elected Controller and kept his seat until 1917. Foster served as a Member of House of Commons of Canada from 1917 to 1921. He was elected as a Union Government candidate in the 1917 federal election for East York. He lost in his party's nomination so he ran as an independent in Toronto East in the 1921 election but failed to keep his seat. Foster returned to City Council for the next three years, then was elected as mayor in 1925. He was a great supporter of Hydro expenditures and loved flowers. As an alderman he fought for the rebuilding of the pavilion at Allan Gardens after it had been destroyed by fire. In his 25 years of civic service he earned the informal title of \\"Honest Tom\\". As mayor of Toronto he was reported to have saved the city two million dollars by rigid economics. Thomas Foster Memorial Temple. Foster was known to collect the rents on his properties in person, even when he was mayor. If a tenant complained about a problem, or wanted a bit of work done, Foster would go out to his car, get his tools and fix the issue on the spot. His penny pinching eventually led to his defeat due to his refusal to raise police salaries. Later years and legacy He was a great traveler and on one of his trips he was inspired by the Taj Mahal. In 1935 and 1936 he had a memorial temple constructed on a hill between Leaskdale and Uxbridge, Ontario, for his family at a cost of $200,000. The temple was designed by Foster with architects H.H. Madill and James H. Craighttp://www.uxbridge.com/people/tfoster.html and inspired by Mughal architecture and Byzantine architecture. He died at the age of 93 and is buried in the massive mausoleum on a hill north of town on Durham Regional Road 1 which includes the remains of Foster, his wife and daughter. Foster left $80,000 in funds to maintain the property in perpetuity but the trustees spent the principal and the funds had dried up by the 1990s, leaving the Town of Uxbridge to take over responsibility for the monument. In 2013, it was estimated that $1 million was needed to repair and restore the building, a controversial task given that the entire budget for the municipality was only $14 million. Among other things, Foster left $500,000 for cancer research, $100,000 for an annual picnic to be held at Exhibition Park for school children, and funds to feed wild birds in Toronto. Inspired by the Great Stork Derby, Mayor Foster also sponsored a contest to reward mothers for their skills at procreation. The prizes were $1,250 for first, $800 for second, and $450 for third. Four ten-years periods began and ended on his death date, and ran from 1945‚Äì55, 1948‚Äì58, 1951‚Äì61, and 1954-64.Stork Derby Series Faces Toronto; $10,000 Is To Go To Most Prolific.

Born in Rowan County, North Carolina, White served as a captain in the county's militia during the American Revolutionary War. In 1783, he led an expedition into the upper Tennessee Valley, where he discovered the future site of Knoxville. White served in various official capacities with the failed State of Franklin (1784-1788) before building White's Fort in 1786. The fort was chosen as the capital of the Southwest Territory in 1790, and White donated the land for a permanent city, Knoxville, in 1791. He represented Knox County at Tennessee's constitutional convention in 1796. During the Creek War (1813), White served as a brigadier general in the Tennessee militia.Mary Rothrock, The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 503-505. White had a reputation for patience and tactfulness that was often lacking in his fellow Euro- American settlers on the Appalachian frontier. As lieutenant colonel commandant of the Knox County militia, White managed to defuse a number of potentially hostile situations between the settlers and the local Native Americans. He donated the land for many of Knoxville's early public buildings, and helped establish Blount College (now the University of Tennessee). White's descendants continued to play prominent roles in the political and economic affairs of Knoxville into the twentieth century. Biography =Early life= Brigadier General James White was born in Salisbury, Rowan County, North Carolina. He was born to Moses White and Mary McConnell White, who were of Scots-Irish descent. In 1770, White married Mary Lawson. White served as a captain in either the Rowan County Regiment or the Mecklenburg County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the American Revolution, which would subsequently entitle him to a tract of land as payment for his service. As a result of North Carolina's Land Grab Act, which opened up lands in what is now East Tennessee to settlement, White and several others explored the Tennessee Valley as far west as what is now Lenoir City in 1783. White eventually obtained a grant for a tract of land at what is now Knoxville, and in 1784 he was elected to the senate of the new State of Franklin, a position which kept him preoccupied for the next two years. White relocated to what is now Knox County in 1785, initially building a simple cabin at what is now the Riverdale community east of modern Knoxville. Within a year, however, he had moved to his tract along the confluence of First Creek and the Tennessee River, and built what became known as White's Fort.William J. MacArthur, Jr., Lucile Deaderick (ed.), \\"Knoxville's History: An Interpretation,\\" Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 3-4. =White's Fort= In 1786, White and fellow explorer James Connor erected White's Fort on a hill overlooking the confluence of First Creek and the Tennessee River. William Blount, governor the Southwest Territory (created in 1790), chose the fort as the Territory's capital, and appointed White justice of the peace and a major in the Hawkins County militia. The following year, White set aside a portion of his land for the creation a territorial capital, named \\"Knoxville\\" after Secretary of War Henry Knox. The new city was platted by White's son-in-law, Charles McClung, and lots were sold in October 1791. Upon creation of Knox County in 1792, White became lieutenant colonel commandant of the new county's militia. This appointment came during the latter years of the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars, a period of heightened hostilities between the Chickamauga Cherokee and the white settlers. In 1793, White defused a potentially violent situation when he dispersed a mob of angry settlers that had amassed at Gamble's Station for a march against the Overhill towns. The Cherokee considered White a man of honor,Charles Faulkner, James White. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 25 March 2016. and the Creeks praised his \\"goodness.\\" In 1798, White helped negotiate the First Treaty of Tellico. In 1796, White represented Knox County at Tennessee's constitutional convention (which took place near his fort). After the admission of the state to the Union, White was elected brigadier general of the new state's Hamilton District (which included what is now Knox, Jefferson, Blount, and Sevier counties), and was elected to the state senate. Upon William Blount's return from the U.S. Senate in 1797, White resigned to allow Blount to run for the seat. =Creek War= Following the Fort Mims massacre of August 1813, Andrew Jackson and John Coffee led the Tennessee militia into northern Alabama in October of that year to engage a contingent of hostile \\"Red Stick\\" Creeks. The militiamen scored victories at the Battle of Tallushatchee (November 3) and at the Battle of Talladega (November 9). In the aftermath of the latter, one of the hostile groups, the Hillabee, made peace arrangements with Jackson. However, the Tennessee militia's East Tennessee contingent, led by John Cocke, had arrived around the same time from Fort Armstrong, and was unaware of the peace negotiations.Frank Owsley, Struggle for the Gulf Borderlands: The Creek War and the Battle of New Orleans, 1812-1815 (Gainesville: University Presses of Florida, 1981), pp. 64-67. On November 11, Cocke ordered James White, leader of the Hamilton District militia, to destroy the Hillabee towns. Over the next several days, White attacked the villages of Little Oakfusky and Genalga, burning 123 houses and capturing several Hillabees. On November 18, White dispatched a force of allied Cherokee under Gideon Morgan to surround the main Hillabee town. The Hillabee, believing they had made peace, were unprepared for an attack, and were unable to resist Morgan's assault. The town was destroyed, 64 Hillabees were killed, and several hundred were captured. The destruction of the Hillabee towns, sometimes called the \\"Hillabee Massacre,\\"H. S. Halbert and T. H. Ball, The Creek War of 1813 and 1814 (University of Alabama Press, 1969), p. 271. greatly agitated Jackson, who believed the withdrawal of the Hillabee would demoralize the remaining Red Sticks. To further complicate matters, the East Tennesseans' terms of service were about to expire. In December, Jackson ordered Cocke and the East Tennessee militiamen to return home. The enraged Hillabee quickly rejoined the Red Stick Confederacy, and fought until the end of the war. Later life In 1800, White moved to his country estate east of Knoxville, perhaps having grown weary of the city, which had developed into a rowdy frontier capital.\\"James White's Not Quite Mansions. Metro Pulse, 10 June 2010. Accessed at the Internet Archive, 2 October 2015. He was again elected to the state senate in 1801 and 1803. White served as an elder in the Lebanon-in-the-Forks Presbyterian Church, and later served as an elder in the First Presbyterian Church in Knoxville, which stood on land White had set aside for a church in the 1790s. White died in 1821 at his country estate, and was buried next to his wife in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery. Legacy White's descendants played prominent political and economic roles in Knoxville's development for more than a century after his death. His eldest son, Hugh Lawson White, was a United States Senator, and ran for president on the Whig ticket in 1836. Along with Charles McClung, White's sons-in-law included Judge John Overton (married to Mary White), a cofounder of Memphis, Tennessee, and Senator John Williams (married to Melinda White).Samuel G. Heiskell, Andrew Jackson and Early Tennessee History (Nashville: Ambrose Printing Company, 1918), p. 53. His other descendants include Congressman Joseph Lanier Williams, railroad magnate Charles McClung McGhee, Admiral Richmond P. Hobson,Leota Driver Maiden, \\"Colonel John Williams,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 30 (1958), p. 46. and playwright Tennessee Williams.\\"Ask Doc Knox,\\" A Rare Antebellum Manse on Riverside Drive, Metro Pulse, 12 April 2010. Accessed at the Internet Archive, 2 October 2015. In 1970, White's Fort was reconstructed as a museum in downtown Knoxville. White's cabin, which provides the fort's southwest corner, is the only surviving authentic part of the fort, although it had been dismantled and moved several times over the years before being reassembled at its present location. White's other namesakes in Knoxville include the General James White Memorial Civic Coliseum, the James White Parkway, and the James White Greenway. In the early 1990s, Pamela Dishongh, who was conducting a survey of the Riverdale Historic District in eastern Knox County for its inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, discovered what was believed to have been White's first cabin (1785) in Knox County on the front lawn of the McNutt-Campbell-Kennedy House. A subsequent archaeological survey of the site led by University of Tennessee archaeologist Charles Faulkner confirmed the cabin was probably built by White. Faulkner suggests the cabin was a very simple log structure meant to provide temporary shelter.Charles Faulkner, \\"James White's First Cabin in Knox County: An Archaeological and Historic Study,\\" Journal of East Tennessee History, Vol. 87 (2015), pp. 84-92.

It was a former Catholic diocese. The same ancient name is revived since the 1980's as a coastal urban development project on the location of former chemical industries.  Etymology  The latin name Taparura originates in the greek \\"Taphro√∫ria\\" Œ§Œ±œÜœÅŒøœçœÅŒπŒ± which means \\"the fortified\\" place or settlement. It is uncertain whether the greek name was given after a greek settlement or by phenicians as part of their commercial and military settlements during the 4th century B.C. The same greek meaning was translated into Berber after the Roman era (in the Byzantine era) in \\"Ksar S-Fa-Ekez\\" which gives the current name of the city Sfax. History Taparura was originally a civitas (town), within Byzacena during the Roman Empire.

KPU is one of the largest institutions by enrolment in British Columbia with a total of 20,000 students and 1,400 faculty members across its five locations, encompassing the Metro Vancouver district. KPU provides undergraduate and vocational education including bachelor's degrees, associate degrees, diplomas, certificates, apprenticeships, and citations in more than 120 diverse programs. The school operates largely as an undergraduate polytechnic university but also serves as a vocational school offering apprenticeships for the skilled trades as well as diplomas in vocational education for skilled technicians and workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and criminology. Kwantlen Polytechnic University was founded as Kwantlen College in 1981 as a response to the growing need for expanded vocational training across the Fraser Valley. In 1995, it became a university college. In 2008, the provincial government announced its intention to amend the University Act to appoint Kwantlen University College a polytechnic university. The legislation renaming the university college to university received royal assent on May 29, 2008 and KPU began operation as Kwantlen Polytechnic University on September 1, 2008.Queen's Printer, Victoria. Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia 4th Session, 38th Parliament, May 29, 2008. Retrieved on: September 6, 2008 KPU became a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) on October 24, 2008. Also in affiliation with KPU include: the International Association of Universities (IAU), the Colleges and Institutes Canada (CICan), the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU), the Canadian Bureau for International Education (CBIE), and the Canadian University Press (CUP). The Globe and Mail Canadian University Report ranked KPU among the top post- secondary institution relative to enrolment across Canada, earning numerous grades in the \\"A to B Range\\" in categories such as quality of teaching and learning, career preparation, student satisfaction and information technology. Published in Maclean's magazine, the National Survey of Student Engagement also listed KPU among the top Canadian institutions relative to student participation, educational practices, and quality of education. History =Beginnings= Kwantlen College was formed in 1981 by separation from Douglas College. There were more than 200 suggestions in a contest to name the new South Fraser region college. The winning entry \\"Kwantlen\\" was submitted by Stan McKinnon. \\"Kwantlen\\" comes from the name of the Kwantlen First Nation in whose traditional territory the university is located. Chief Joe Gabriel of the Kwantlen First Nation gave permission for the college to use the Kwantlen name. Following a provincial government initiative designed to increase access to degree programs in British Columbia that begun in 1988, five community colleges were granted authority to offer baccalaureate degrees. These five institutions-- Cariboo, Fraser Valley, Kwantlen, Malaspina, and Okanagan--were renamed university colleges. Initially, they offered degrees under the aegis of one or more of the three provincial universities. In 1995, they were awarded the authority to offer degrees in their own right. Also in 1995, the province of British Columbia enacted legislation changing the institution's name to Kwantlen University College. =Expansion and growth= Transition to University Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Surrey Campus, Main building (exterior) In 2005, Kwantlen University College began a campaign to convince elected officials at the municipal and provincial levels, and various key community leaders, to support its efforts to become a university. Removing \\"college\\" from its official name would require approval from the government of British Columbia. In its case for the university status, Kwantlen's administrators claimed the change to Kwantlen University would: * Enhance Kwantlen's ability to help British Columbia become the best educated, most literate jurisdiction in North America; and * Bring multiple benefits to the fastest growing region in BC and help BC achieve long-term growth and prosperity. In 2007, Murray Coell, Minister of Advanced Education and Minister responsible for Research and Technology was joined by special advisor Geoff Plant, to release the Campus 2020 report that recommends Kwantlen University College become Kwantlen University. On April 22, 2008, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell announced that Kwantlen would become Kwantlen Polytechnic University. On April 22, 2008, the provincial government announced its intention to amend the University Act to make Kwantlen a polytechnic university, in recognition of its \\"versatility in providing academic, trades and horticultural training.\\" The legislation renaming the University College to University received royal assent on May 29, 2008. AUCC membership On October 24, 2008, KPU became a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC). Although the AUCC is not an official government accreditation body, its standardized membership benchmarks and requirements for members serves to ease a student's ability to transfer from undergraduate to graduate programs across Canada and the world. Campuses KPU campuses are all in British Columbia's Lower Mainland. They are located in: * Surrey at Newton Town Centre, Cloverdale, and in the City Centre. * Richmond. * and Langley. Note: Wikipedia Commons has a gallery of KPU's campuses - Commons:Kwantlen Polytechnic University. = KPU Tech (Cloverdale) = KPU Tech, formerly known as KPU Cloverdale is the second newest of the five KPU campuses, opening in April 2007. The new Cloverdale campus replaced the aging Newton campus facilities which had served as the home for trades training since Kwantlen's inception. The new Cloverdale building is certified as an LEED Gold building and houses KPU's Trades & Technology programs, which include appliance servicing, automotive servicing, carpentry, farriery, masonry, parts and warehousing, welding, plumbing, public safety communications and CADD technologies. = KPU Langley = The Langley campus is home to the university‚Äôs School of Horticulture - which includes a field lab, greenhouses, and gardens.

The campus occupies 5 of the lower floors of the building. It was designed to focus towards post-baccalaureate education for mature students as well as business education. The campus was expected to open in early 2016, but was consistently delayed due to construction issues with the skyscraper. Academics KPU has over 120 different programs across seven distinct faculties ‚Äî Academic and Career Advancement, Arts, Business, Design, Health, Science and Horticulture, and Trades and Technology ‚Äî where students can pursue a degree, diploma, certificate, citation, or work towards completing an apprenticeship. =Organic Farmer Training= KPU operates two farms that offer \\"Farm School\\" training as a non-credit continuing education program. These schools, located in Richmond and Tsawwassen, teach students applied sustainable farming practices and include a farm incubator program for alumni. =Libraries= KPU has a library on all of its campuses, with the exception of Civic Centre. The largest library is on the Surrey campus with smaller program focused collections available in Richmond, Langley, and Cloverdale. KPU students and faculty have access to millions of items through the library, including online journal and newspaper articles, print and ebooks, streaming media and more. Items from other parts of Canada and around the globe can also be accessed through the library's free interlibrary loans service. =Student enrolment= KPU has an enrolment of more than 20,000 students annually and over 12,000 FTE (full-time equivalency) students annually. KPU's region (Richmond, Delta, Surrey, White Rock and Langley) has a population of over 800,000. =Faculty and employees= As of Fall 2016, Faculty and staff employees number over 1,400.

Cooperative education KPU offers cooperative education in several degree programs including Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Technology as well as diploma programs. Such programs include dedicated work-placement semesters that match their field of study, in addition to regular studies. Program transferability KPU offers many transferable courses to other educational institutions, which often lead to direct transfers into second-year or third-year studies at other post secondary institutions. To aid in this, KPU is a part of the BC Transfer Guide Website, an online resource for planning and understanding transfer in the BC post-secondary education system. New program development Additional major and minor programs and specialized courses are currently under development. KPU will be the first public, post-secondary institution in British Columbia to offer studies in Traditional Chinese Medicine. KPU's Faculty of Arts has also launched two new program offerings; a minor in language and culture, and a major in applied geography. In 2016, KPU launched an introductory bhangra course.

Student life Kwinten is the mascot for the Kwantlen Eagles athletics program =Athletics= KPU was previously a member of the Pacific Western Athletic Association (or PacWest) which is affiliated with the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association. The University had six varsity teams competing in four sports (Men's & Women's Soccer, Men's & Women's Basketball, Badminton, and Golf). The Athletic teams, known as the Kwantlen Eagles, were supported by \\"Kwinten\\" - the University's mascot. KPU Athletics has had notable results in the following sports: Women's Soccer - 2009 & 2010 PacWest Provincial Champions, 2009 CCAA National Bronze medalists Badminton - 2010 National Women's Doubles Bronze, 2011 National Mixed Doubles Gold, 2012 National Men's Doubles Bronze, 2013 National Men's Doubles Silver. The Eagles athletics program ceased operations after the 2015-6 academic year. = Sport + Recreation (2016 - Present) = KPU Sport + Rec proudly offers fitness centres and studios on all KPU campuses. Free membership to fitness centre is available to all current students, employees, and alumni. Tournaments, sports leagues, intramurals along with various Lunch & Lawn activities are available through KPU Sport + Rec. =Kwantlen Student Association= The Kwantlen Student Association (KSA) is an elected student body that contributes to community life, and allocates student funds to social, cultural and entertainment programs for students. The KSA was founded as the Kwantlen College Student Society under the Society Act of British Columbia in August 1981. Since the early 1980s the KSA has also been affiliated with the Canadian Federation of Students as one of its founding members. For a brief period of time in the late 1990s, the KSA was the only Student Association in Canada to have held membership within both the Canadian Federation of Students and the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations at the same time. In March 2008, the Kwantlen Student Association (KSA) organized a referendum to disaffiliate from the CFS. One of the reasons given for disaffiliation was media coverage in 2007, alleging corruption within the Douglas Students' Union of the CFS. The KSA also criticized the financial transparency of CFS-BC and argued that the CFS was ineffective at lobbying for students. As of January 2013, the KSA has been attempting to de-federate from the CFS and has joined the \\"Alliance of BC Students\\" as an alternative lobbying body. At a Special General Meeting held on November 30, 2011 Kwantlen students voted 352 to 0 to remove thirteen directors of the KSA and place them into \\"bad standing\\" where they would be unable to run for future office. The vote was held over allegations of conflicts of interest in settling litigation, association with the embezzlement of two million dollars of student funds, and a 40% pay raise to the elected officials on their first day of office among other things.  Membership  The highest authority within the Kwantlen Student Association lies with the membership (who are the students of Kwantlen Polytechnic University). Membership is mandatory. The membership delegates its authority over the day-to-day operations of the society to an elected Board of Directors (Council), which is bound to operate under a Constitution and a set of Bylaws.  Council  Each year in February KPU students may run for and elect a Council to a one-year term of office that spans April 1 to March 31. The Council is responsible for, and exercises full control over the affairs of the Society while the executive members assist with the management of the day-to-day operations of the society. The Council holds regularly scheduled meetings at least twice each month, excluding the months of July, August and December. Member services The KSA operates a cafe, a fitness centre and a social justice centre on campus. It employs an ombudsperson, distributes day planners, and provides advocacy services as well as funding for campus clubs, events, conferences, and political special interest groups. Through the KSA, students and other members of the Kwantlen community are also eligible for special discounts including bus and train passes, discount movie tickets, and other seasonal offers. Finally, full-time students who do not have comparable coverage elsewhere, are automatically eligible to receive benefits from a health and dental plan. Locations The organization's main office is located at the Surrey Campus of Kwantlen Polytechnic University. The society also has offices and provides services at KPU's three other campuses in Cloverdale, Langley and Richmond. The KSA does not own a student union building. =The Runner= The Runner is the institution's independent student newspaper. It is a member of the Canadian University Press. Canadian University Press  Presse universitaire canadienneMembers  Canadian University Press  Presse universitaire canadienne . Cup.ca. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. Since early 2009, The Runner has added to Kwantlen student life by providing the community with \\"a freely distributed, year-round, multi- campus, student-owned, student-run news and campus culture publication\\". It receives some of its funds from the Kwantlen Student Association under a levy; however, it is run as separate, autonomous incorporated B.C. non-profit society, Polytechnic Ink Publishing Society (PIPS), with its own Kwantlen student board of directors.

Background The tomb of Anarkali is located on the grounds of Lahore's Punjab Civil Secretariat complex near the British-era Mall, southwest of the Walled City of Lahore. It is considered to be one of the earliest Mughal tombs still in existence, and is considered to be one of the most significant buildings of the early Mughal period. The building is currently used as the Punjab Archives, and public access is limited. History Construction of the tomb dates to either 1599 C.E., or 1615 C.E. The tomb was said to be built by the Mughal Emperor Jehangir for his love Anarkali, as per legend, was caught by Emperor Akbar for exchanging glances with Jehangir, at the time known as Prince Saleem. Anarkali was reportedly a concubine of Emperor Akbar, and this action reportedly enraged the Emperor Akbar so much, that he had Anarkali interred alive in a wall. When Prince Saleem ascended the throne and took the name \\"Jehangir,\\" he is reported to have ordered the construction of a tomb over the site of the wall in which Anarkali was reportedly buried. Eighteenth-century historian Abdullah Chagatai reported that the tomb was not the resting place for Anarkali, but instead for Jehangir's beloved wife Sahib-i-Jamal Begum. Many modern historians accept the credulity of this account. The building is currently used as the Punjab Archives, so access to the public is limited. During the time of the Sikh Empire, the tomb was occupied by Kharak Singh, and later was further desecrated by its conversion into the residence for the wife of General Jean-Baptiste Ventura, who was employed in the army of Ranjit Singh. The tomb was then converted during the British Raj into clerical offices in 1847 before repurposing the tomb into the Anglican St. James Church in 1851, and later regarded as Lahore's \\"Protestant Cathedral.\\" In 1891, the church congregation was relocated, and the tomb was repurposed as the Punjab Record Office. The occupant's cenotaph was removed when the tomb was repurposed into a church. When the building no longer served as a church, the cenotaph was placed at the site of the former altar, and not at the original site of the cenotaph. Architecture The structure's foundation are in the basic shape of an octagon, with alternating measurements of 44 feet and 30 feet for each side with semi-octagonal towers at each corner. The structure is also topped by a double-dome, and is one of the earlier examples of such a dome from the Mughal era. The dome rests upon 8 arches, each measuring 12 feet 3 inches. The large arches in the sides of the building were once open in typical Mughal fashion, but were blocked off by the British. The building is today covered in whitewashing. It was reportedly once surrounded by a garden. The building is currently used as the Punjab Archives, so access to the public is limited. =Cenotaph= The richly carved cenotaph is made of white marble. The white marble cenotaph features carvings with the 99 names of Allah, and was described by 19th-century historians as \\"one of the finest pieces of carving in the world.\\" In addition to the 99 names of Allah, the cenotaph is inscribed with a Persian couplet written by the Emperor Jehangir which reads: \\"Ah! could I behold the face of my beloved once more, I would give thanks unto my God until the day of resurrection.\\" Conservation The tomb is listed on the Protected Heritage Monuments of the Archaeology Department of Punjab.

The primary mission of the units on the base is to rebuild and repair ground combat and combat support equipment and to support installations on the East Coast of the United States. Today one of MCLB Albany‚Äôs most important facilities is the Marine Corps Logistics Command's Maintenance Center. The only other facility of this kind is located at MCLB Albany‚Äôs sister installation, Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow, California. The base comprises more than and in 2002 employed more than 2,400 civilians along with a complement of 600 Marines. One of the Corps' major commands, Marine Corps Logistics Command, is based at MCLB Albany. The command also encompasses activities at bases in Barstow, California, and Jacksonville, Florida. History Brig. Gen. Raymond P. Coffman and his staff The base was commissioned on March 1, 1952, as the Marine Corps Depot of Supplies. At that time, Marine Brigadier General Raymond P. Coffman assumed command and a small contingent of Marines established headquarters in temporary buildings. Albany was chosen as the site for the logistics base after a two-year search in the early 1950s for a level area convenient to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean and serviced by road and rail. Albany was also attractive for its inland location, well away from the possibility of saltwater corrosion of the stored equipment, and its adequate workforce. Construction continued rapidly, and by early 1954, the station was sufficiently complete with warehouses and administration buildings to assume supply support for Marines east of the Rocky Mountains and in the Atlantic area. On July 29, 1954, the command was renamed the Marine Corps Supply Center Albany. The MCSC managed and controlled supplies at storage and issue locations in the eastern half of the United States, the Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea areas. Depot level rebuild operations began to function at the base in October 1954. The base opened in 1954, as the Marine Corps Depot of Supplies. In 1959, renamed the Marine Corps Supply Center, it was assigned the mission of rebuilding nonaviation equipment. The MCSC Albany was redesignated Marine Corps Logistics Support Base Atlantic on April 1, 1976, because the Marine Corps Supply Activity at Philadelphia and its inventory control, financial management, procurement and technical support functions were relocated to the Albany installation. On November 1, 1978, the installation was renamed once again ‚Äì Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany. The full spectrum of logistics support functions required to support the Marine Corps ground weapon systems and equipment was now performed at this base. On January 17, 1990, the Commandant of the Marine Corps designated the commanding general at MCLB Albany to also take on the responsibilities of commander, Marine Corps Logistics Bases. The reorganization placed control of MCLB Albany, MCLB Barstow, and the Blount Island Command in Jacksonville, Florida, under this single commander. Environment and archaeology Preserving the environment and the wildlife in and around the base has been a priority since the early planning phases of the facility. Colonel A.E. Dubber, the officer who chose the Albany site, insisted early on that he wanted no wildlife disturbed unnecessarily and that as many trees as possible should be saved. Because of his policies the base is lined with pecan orchards and rows of oaks. The so-called Dubber Oak, upon which the base was aligned during construction, still stands near the main gate. In 1973 more than 200 Indian artifacts were discovered on the base. Arrowheads, flint knives, scrapers, and other ancient tools estimated to be more than 8,000 years old were unearthed by archaeologists. Their presence suggests that the area may have been a trading or supply post for Native Americans. The EPA has conducted tests (and continues to monitor) the contamination by hazardous substances on the base of the ground and the drinking water supply. Persian Gulf War From the beginning of the historic buildup of U.S., Arab and other allied air, ground and naval forces against Iraq during 1990 and 1991 until Operation Desert Storm ended, MCLB Albany and its personnel were deeply involved in the greatest surge of activity in the history of the base. Between August 10, 1990, and March 31, 1991, MCLB Albany provided support to the Marine Air-Ground Task Forces sent to the Persian Gulf area. During the Persian Gulf War (1990‚Äì91) the base's workforce shipped more than 9 million pounds of equipment to air and seaports for rapid transport to troops abroad. Personnel also installed twenty-six \\"tractor protective kits\\" on bulldozers used to break through Iraqi barriers and minefields. The armored bulldozers helped open the way for coalition troops to overrun enemy defenses. During the first phase of activation of Prepositioned War Reserves, MCLB Albany‚Äôs Materiel Division (today, MCLB Fleet Support Division and DLA Defense Distribution Depot Albany) shipped more than nine million pounds of goods and equipment on more than 300 semi-trailer trucks to airports and seaports of embarkation to Saudi Arabia. The division‚Äôs support continued throughout the crises as its personnel established around the clock operations and worked nearly 50,000 overtime hours packing goods that included 4,800 supplemental items packs and other high priority requisitions for U.S. military personnel. A M88 Recovery Vehicle at the Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany undergoes depot maintenance in 2005. MCLB Albany also provided medical support throughout the crises. Two doctors, eight medical corpsmen and one independent duty technician from the Naval Branch Medical Clinic at the base deployed to the Persian Gulf. Additionally, the Air Force Medical Logistics team at the base had four air transportable hospitals (ATHs) that were assembled at the base prepositioned in the Persian Gulf area. Two additional ATHs, along with 895,000 pounds of additional medical materials and equipment that were assembled at the base were also sent to the Gulf War area. The Publications Branch at the base sent 29,000 publications and technical manuals to reconstitute the Maritime Prepositioned Force in Saudi Arabia. This work continued for nearly a year after the war ended. The Maintenance Center performed a myriad of projects and support activities during the war, many of which were innovative and were accomplished in record time. Notable among the Maintenance Center‚Äôs support were personnel who developed and installed 26 Tractor Protective Kits on II Marine Expeditionary Force‚Äôs bulldozers in the Persian Gulf area. These armor-plated bulldozers broke the paths through Saddam Hussein‚Äôs so-called \\"Wall of Death\\" minefields and other fortified barriers, opening the roads along which the Marine divisions pursued and defeated the Iraqi army. More than 100 MCLB Albany Marines, Navy personnel and civilian employees served in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.

It is the main church of the Archdiocese of Bangkok. It was visited by Pope John Paul II and Pope Francis during their trips to Thailand in 1984 and 2019. History Assumption Cathedral is located within 100 meters of the Oriental Hotel and the French Embassy, and the original building was the result of the request from a French missionary, Father Pascal in 1809 and the work of a French architect which saw the cathedral completed in 1821 during the reign of King Rama II. The cathedral was named Assumption after the Virgin Mary and she is commemorated at the church during The Feast of the Assumption, on St. Mary's Day on 15 August. Throughout the latter half of the 19th century, the church and surrounding area played an important role for Christian missionaries arriving in Bangkok, particularly after 1860. The cathedral is part of a series of buildings which consist of Assumption Convent School (Thailand), Catholic Mission of Bangkok, Assumption Printing Press and rectory which were inhabited by the missionaries during their time in the city. However around 1909 or 1910 the church underwent significant reconstruction and was rebuilt in the romanesque style between 1910 and 1918. The church has a relatively tall rectangular structure with a red brick exterior which stands out against its surrounding white buildings. The tall square towers flank the main entrance. Inside is a high ceiling adorned with many ornate decorations. Construction costs were largely covered by a local catholic businessman, Mr Low Khiok Chiang (also known as Jacobe) who owned the nearby Kiam Hoa Heng & Company, a Chinese Teochew family business. In 1942, during World War II, nearby buildings were destroyed by bombing which resulted in serious damage to the church. It underwent extensive restoration shortly afterwards, and was partly refurbished in the 1980s and 1990s. Stained glass windows are now used in the cathedral today. Assumption Cathedral had been visited by two supreme pontiffs. First, in May 1984 the cathedral welcomed Pope John Paul II and on the 22nd of November 2019, Pope Francis visited the cathedral during his apostolic visit to Thailand where he conduct the holy mass with catholic youth from around the country, given that the church is the center of the Roman Catholic diocese there. The church is open seven days a week. Services for mass on Sundays are held at 6am, 7:30am, 8:30am, 10am and 5pm.  Special places  Inside of Assumptiom Cathedral Bangkok The significant part of the Cathedral is in the crypt underneath the Sanctuary which kept the remains of the bishops and the missionaries including that of Fr Nicholas Boonkerd Kitbamrung who was proclaimed a martyr by Pope John Paul II on 5 March 2000 in Vatican. His relics were transferred to the shrine built in the compound of St. Peter‚Äôs church in Sampran, Nakornprathom Province. There still remains a special altar devoted to him on the left side of the Cathedral. Besides being a place of worship and for performing sacred ceremonies, the role of the Assumption Cathedral is the church of the head of the local diocese which was led by Cardinal Michael Meechai Kitboonchu. The Cathedral is used to celebrate functions such as ordination of deacons, priests and bishops, and is said to be the centre of Catholics in Thailand.  Notable visitors  Visitors include, on 4 May 1946, King Ananda Mahidol with his younger brother, then-Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej. Pope John Paul II visited on 10 May 1984. On 22 July 1995, Princesses Soamsawali and Bajirakitiyabha visited the Cathedral during a religious ceremony for the soul of the late King‚Äôs mother. In 2002 the Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn and his consort Srirasmi visited the Catholic community at the Assumption Cathedral.  Nearby sites  Three schools are situated in the compound of the Cathedral: The Assumption College, the Assumption Convent and the Assumption Suksa. There used to be a seminary and a printing house. Many offices of the Catholic organizations used to be nearby the Cathedral.  Events  A ceremony held in the cathedral was that of the proclamation of Blessed Father Nicholas Boonkerd as Priest and Martyr.

A member of the Merovingian dynasty, he was a child and his reign so brief and contested that he may be considered only a pretender. He is sometimes even left unnumbered and Clovis IV is instead called Clovis III. The only source for his reign is the contemporary Suffering of Leudegar. Following the assassination of Childeric II in 675, the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria accepted different claimants. In Neustria, under the influence of Leudegar, bishop of Autun, Childeric's younger brother Theuderic III was installed as king. In Austrasia, Ebroin, the former mayor of the palace, installed Clovis III with support of a faction of the magnates opposed to the mayoralty of Wulfoald. Ebroin and his allies claimed that Clovis was a son of Chlothar III, Childeric's older brother. The Suffering of Leudegar claims that this was a lie, although there is nothing implausible in it, since Chlothar was about twenty-three years old when he died. Nor is the naming of Clovis unusual, since firstborn sons in the Merovingian dynasty were often named after their grandfathers, and Chlothar's father was Clovis II. When Theuderic III had a son in 677, however, he named him Clovis (the future Clovis IV) and this may be taken as evidence that the Suffering is correct and his brother never had a son of that name. Ebroin needed a legitimate Merovingian in order to raise an army and to issue legally binding orders (praecepta). (A generation later, the same requirement forced Charles Martel to find a Merovingian pretender, Chlothar IV, in 717.) Once raised, Ebroin marched the army into the northwest of the kingdom and seized the royal treasury in the fall of 675. Once he had secured control of the treasury, he no longer needed Clovis and he abandoned him, declaring himself for Theuderic III. Those Austrasians opposed to Ebroin and to union with Neustria, however, did not recognise Theuderic, and instead enthroned Dagobert II sometime between 2 April and 30 June 676. There are some coins that have been attributed to the short reign of Clovis III. This attribution, first suggested by Jean Lafaurie in 1956, has been accepted by Egon Felder and Philip Grierson. A gold tremissis bearing the name CHLODOVIO RIX and the name of the moneyer, Eborino, probably belongs to him. Although it was possibly minted under Clovis IV, there is no evidence for the continuation of gold coinage in the Frankish kingdoms past the 670s. Likewise, late gold tremisses of Marseille bearing the name of Clovis probably belong to Clovis III. Stylistically, these have much in common with the coinage of Dagobert II, bearing the cross-on-steps motif on the reverse in imitation of Byzantine coinage. Of the ultimate fate of Clovis III nothing is known. References Bibliography  * * External links *The Oxford Merovingian Page.

Tottle asserts that fraudulent \\"famine-genocide\\" propaganda has been spread by former Nazis, anti-communists and Ukrainian nationalists, sometimes posing as academics in Canadian universities. Tottle's critics regard him as a \\"Soviet apologist\\", or a \\"denunciator\\" of the famine. Tottle has been defended by the Stalin Society, author Jeff Coplon and the Swedish Communist Party, who insist that his book is valid historical research that exposed the \\"myth of the famine-genocide [...] once and for all\\".  Biography  Tottle was born in Quebec, but later lived mainly in Western Canada. He had various jobs throughout his working life, including photo-lab technician, fine artist, miner and steelworker. As a trade union activist, he edited The Challenger, a journal of the United Steelworkers, from 1975 to 1985. Tottle also researched labour history and worked as a union organiser, for example among Chicano farm workers in California and Native Indian farm workers in Manitoba. Tottle has written for various Canadian and American publications. Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard  Douglas Tottle is mostly known for his controversial book Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard in which he argues that claims that Holodomor was an intentional genocide are \\"fraudulent\\" and \\"a creation of Nazi propagandists\\". Tottle argues that the major cause of the famine was the weather conditions, drought especially and suggests that greater blame can actually be placed on kulaks sabotage and hoarding of grain. In addition, Tottle puts significant emphasis into claiming the invalidity of existing photographic evidence. Tottle writes that he is more interested in the \\"Nazi and fascist connections\\" and the \\"coverups of wartime collaboration\\" (p. 3). Critics argued that both of these topics, even if objectively treated, are not relevant to the study of the famine and can neither prove nor disprove the existence of the famine or define the nature of the tragedy. Critics also argued that Tottle's attacks on various segments of the Ukrainian diaspora constitute hate literature.The Last Stand of the Ukrainian Famine-Genocide Deniers by Roman Serbyn, Professor of Russian and East European History, University of Quebec, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, The Ukrainian Canadian Magazine, February, 1989 In his book Searching for place: Ukrainian Displaced Persons, Canada, and the Migration of Memory, Lubomyr Luciuk comments: \\"For a particularly base example of famine-denial literature, see Tottle, Fraud, famine, and fascism [...]\\".Lubomyr Luciuk, Searching for place: Ukrainian displaced persons, Canada, and the migration of memory, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000, p. 413. In 1988, the International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932‚Äì33 Famine in Ukraine was set up to establish whether the famine existed and its cause. Tottle was invited by the commission to attend the hearings, but did not respond. Tottle's book was examined during the Brussels sitting of the commission, held between May 23‚Äì27, 1988, with testimony from various expert witnesses. The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the notion of the \\"famine-genocide\\" on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a private person without official Soviet assistance.A.J. Hobbins, Daniel Boyer, \\"Seeking Historical Truth: the International Commission of Inquiry into the 1932-33 Famine in the Ukraine\\", Dalhousie Law Journalhh, 2001, Vol 24, page 166 Recent research has shown that Soviet government institutes contributed to its writing and reviewed manuscripts; Soviet diplomats also promoted the book.

The lake is within the borders of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park.Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park (Ministry of the Environment (Japan)) The lake has no natural outlet, and flooding of settlements on its shores was a problem until the construction of a canal, completed in 1914, to connect it to a tributary of the Sagami River. As with the other Fuji Five Lakes, the area is a popular resort, with many lakeside hotels, windsurfing facilities, camp sites, and excursion boats. Japanese crucian carp and wakasagi were introduced to the lake in the Meiji period, and sports fishing is also popular. Lake Kawaguchi is the most popular of the Fuji Five Lakes in terms of tourists, and has the most developed tourist infrastructure. The area also serves as a major hub for those wishing to climb Mount Fuji during the climbing season (July and August), and is also popular with photographers due to the panoramic views of the mountain from the shore. In 2013 the lake was added to the World Heritage List as part of the Fujisan Cultural Site. One of the best ways to visit the lake from Tokyo is the JR operated Limited Express Fuji Excursion.

Paul Henry launched on 7 April 2015 and initially had an audience larger than the two shows it replaced on radio and TV. For nine months in 2012, he also co-hosted an Australian television show, Breakfast, which ceased production on 30 November 2012, due to low ratings. Early life Paul Henry Hopes was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to Brian and Olive Hopes, on 4 August 1960. He attended Cockle Bay Primary in Howick, Auckland. His parents separated when he was 11, and in 1971 he moved with his English-born mother to Bristol, United Kingdom, where he finished his education and won a drama school scholarship. Paul and his mother Olive lived in a council flat. Olive worked triple shifts in a plastic bag factory to make ends meet. Henry says that when he was 25 he discovered that his grandmother was a \\"Gypsy\\". Television and radio career =New Zealand= Henry has been a radio and television presenter in New Zealand, where he was born and has spent the majority of his career. Henry has been a backup host for current affairs show Close Up. After numerous controversies on morning talk show Breakfast which he hosted between 2004 and 2010, Henry was involved in a high- profile scandal in October 2010 involving his pronunciation and ridicule of the name of Indian politician Sheila Dikshit. The scandal culminated in Henry's resignation from TVNZ. Paul Henry started his broadcasting career working for the BBC, as a studio assistant and in the mail room. He worked as a projectionist in the natural history unit, where, according to the Sunday Star Times, \\"David Attenborough would come in and Henry would play the rushes\\". Henry returned to New Zealand when he was 19 and worked as a producer on National Radio. On radio, Henry worked as a breakfast host on 2ZD Radio Wairarapa from 1986 to 1990. Henry left 2ZD to set up his own radio station, 'Today FM 89.3' in 1991, and worked as the breakfast host along with local identity Rick Long, and former 2ZD station manager John (Johnnie) Shearer. Notable employees of TODAY FM included Hilary Pankurst (now Barry), current co-host of Seven Sharp, and Georgina Beyer, who later became the world's first openly transsexual mayor and MP. The radio station had a unique local format including morning talkback with Rick Long. Henry hosted the breakfast show with his former manager, John Shearer. The breakfast show gave Henry free licence to shamelessly promote his radio station. His co-host Shearer was often at the receiving end of Henry's jokes. Henry would famously say he doesn't want to hurt his feelings and every morning when Shearer signed off, Henry would warn listeners to \\"take care on the roads now John Shearer's on the roads\\". At one time the station even flew a helicopter through the breakfast show with Shearer reporting from the air. Henry hosted six breakfast shows per week and often worked late at night and right across the weekend at the station, with outside live broadcasts. In 1992, Henry sold the station to the owner of Port FM, which rebranded the station as HITZ 89FM. Today the station exists as More FM 89.5, 105.5 Wairarapa. For a time there were three radio stations in Wairarapa, Today FM, Radio Wairarapa and Radio Pacific where Henry had hosted or co-hosted a breakfast show on each of the stations. Henry went on to be a foreign correspondent for Radio Pacific and weekend talkback host. Paul Henry presented Radio Pacific's Breakfast - \\"The Morning Grill\\" with Arch Tambakis, then Pam Corkery in the mid 1990s. Later he was the drive host on Radio Pacific, then later Radio Live when the station launched in 2005 and again in 2007. Moving into television, Henry co-hosted TVNZ's Breakfast between 2004 and 2010. In 2009, ratings for the show had improved to around 150,000 viewers from a base of around 100,000. He was also the 2007-2008 host of the New Zealand version of This Is Your Life and was also supposed to host the 2010 series, but did not, after numerous controversies involving the Breakfast programme. He was later replaced by Paul Holmes. Henry won the People's Choice Award, Best Presenter at the 2010 Qantas NZ Film and Television Awards. His outrageous acceptance speech has attracted more than 300,000 views on YouTube. On 10 October 2010, following Henry's controversial comments about the New Zealand Governor General, Sir Anand Satyanand, and the Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, TVNZ announced that Henry had resigned. Paul Henry was forced to apologise. In an interview the following month, Henry claimed that TVNZ, in particular chief executive Rick Ellis, had \\"capitalised\\" on him by encouraging him to be controversial on-air, adding that he believed it was wrong for the New Zealand Government to apologise to India for his remarks. On 1 April 2011, it was announced Paul Henry was returning to radio broadcasting with TVNZ's rival Mediaworks. From July that year, Henry replaced Maggie Barry as the host of Radio Live's drivetime show, a position he had held four years previously. His tenure in the role would this time last just over half a year; Henry moved to Australia the following year to host Network Ten's new morning show. Until this move, Henry was also reported to be working across several high-profile projects on TV3, including a weekly Sunday evening show with the working title The Paul Henry Show, later changed to be a New Zealand edition of the British comedy show Would I Lie to you? which aired in 2012 alongside the production of Henry's Australian show. =Australia= In February 2012, Henry moved to Sydney, Australia to join Network Ten's morning show Breakfast as co-host. The show debuted on 23 February 2012 to low ratings. As in New Zealand, Henry's on-air comments caused controversy: in May 2012 he suggested asylum seekers could stay in people's linen cupboards, and implied they were \\"dirty\\". While in Australia, Henry maintained work in New Zealand media as an Australian correspondent for Radio Live and as the host of Would I Lie to you? on TV3 He made guest appearances on Network Ten programs The Project and The Circle, and was briefly considered as the host of the second series panel show Can of Worms, replacing Ian Dickson. However, the role went eventually to Chrissie Swan Due to low ratings, Henry's Breakfast was cancelled on 30 November 2012 after less than one year on air. During the show's broadcast period, one of Henry's co-hosts and the show's executive producer quit, prompting speculation about whether the departures were due to tension with Henry. A newspaper reported other staff at the network resented Henry, claiming many wouldn't look at him when he walked in the room, and were planning to boycott the Christmas party. Both Henry and the low ratings of the show were continually lampooned by the comedy show The Hamster Wheel. Breakfast's axing fueled speculation Henry would relocate to New Zealand and TVNZ to host a revamped edition of Close Up Henry was offered the central anchor position on TVNZ's new primetime 7pm current affair programme, later titled Seven Sharp, but Henry chose instead to honour his existing contract with Mediaworks. =Return to New Zealand and semi-retirement= In 2011 Henry published an autobiography, What Was I Thinking. The book was a bestseller upon release. In 2013 he released another book, called Outraged also a bestseller. Henry returned to New Zealand after Breakfast ended; in late 2013 it was revealed that from 2014 Paul Henry would be hosting a late night current affairs show called The Paul Henry Show, which would replace the long- running Nightline. The Paul Henry Show lasted one year; in early October 2014 Henry was announced as the presenter for Mediaworks' new breakfast show to air simultaneously on TV3 and Radio Live. This new venture, entitled Paul Henry, replaces both TV3's Firstline and Marcus Lush's morning segment on Radio Live. In 2016, Henry departed Mediaworks and announced he would be entering a period of \\"semi-retirement\\", splitting his time between New Zealand and the United States, and producing wine. = New show \\"Rebuilding Paradise\\" = Following the effects of the coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand, MediaWorks New Zealand announced a new showing hosted by Henry called \\"Rebuilding Paradise\\" starting in April 2020. The show will run four nights per week for four weeks and feature live interviews in regards to the country's response to COVID-19. This is the first project Henry has taken part in since the announcement of this period of \\"semi-retirement\\". Personal life Henry is currently married to entrepreneur Diane Forman. He was previously married to Rachael Hopes (n√©e Orsman), with whom he had three children. Henry was also previously married to radio producer Linzi Dryburgh. In 2014 it was reported in an interview that Henry was a nudist, which Henry has also stated on his show. Political career Henry ran as the National Party candidate for the Wairarapa electorate in the 1999 general election. He lost to former radio colleague and New Zealand Labour Party candidate Georgina Beyer by 3,033 votes. Controversies = Female facial hair = In March 2009, Henry caused offence by pointing out the facial hair of female guest anti-nuclear campaigner and Greenpeace worker Stephanie Mills. TVNZ stated that it had received a \\"handful\\" of complaints. Henry stated to the Sunday Star Times: \\"I certainly have no intention of apologising to people who have written in and complained. The key thing to me is what a fortunate life they must have that they can afford time and energy to complain about such an insignificant thing.\\" = Views on homosexuality = In August 2009, Henry referred to homosexuals as \\"unnatural\\", prompting a complaint to the Broadcasting Standards Authority, which regulates broadcast radio and television content within New Zealand. In February 2010, the Broadcasting Standards Authority declined to uphold the complaint. = Susan Boyle = In November 2009, Henry sparked controversy when he called singer Susan Boyle 'retarded'. His comments led to almost 200 complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Authority and an apology from Television New Zealand. = Governor-General of New Zealand Sir Anand Satyanand = In October 2010, Henry was again the subject of complaints after a live broadcast in which he asked Prime Minister John Key whether the Governor-General, Sir Anand Satyanand, was \\"even a New Zealander\\". Henry went on to ask \\"Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time\\"....\\"are we going to go for someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?\\" Anand is of Indian descent but was born and raised in Auckland. Henry was criticised by Key, Labour leader Phil Goff and race relations commissioner Joris de Bres. Henry later apologised for his comments. After initially expressing its support for Henry, TVNZ announced the following day that it had suspended the presenter for two weeks without pay. = Sheila Dikshit = Following the decision to suspend Henry, TVNZ continued to air a clip in which Henry referred to Delhi's chief minister Sheila Dikshit during the 2010 Commonwealth Games as \\"the dipshit woman\\" and even pronouncing her surname as \\"Dick Shit\\" instead of \\"Dixit\\", going on to state that \\"it's so appropriate, because she's Indian, so she'd be dick-in-shit wouldn't she, do you know what I mean? Walking along the street... it's just so funny.\\" New Zealand Indian Central Association president Paul Singh Bains said the fact that TVNZ was still \\"promoting\\" the clip on its website showed it had \\"totally lost the plot\\" and was insensitive to the offence Henry had caused. Following at least four complaints against the video, TVNZ removed it from the \\"Video extras\\" section of their website. Henry's resignation polarised the New Zealand public, with supporters claiming he was a victim of political correctness, and critics accusing him of pandering to the lowest common denominator. India summoned New Zealand's high commissioner Rupert Holborow to protest against Henry's \\"racist and bigoted\\" comments, and Holborow expressed his regret for the \\"deep hurt\\" they had caused. =Asylum seekers= On 16 May 2012, Henry was criticised for comments made on Breakfast regarding asylum seekers. When commenting on a newspaper article, about the Australian Government offering families money to house asylum seekers, Henry suggested that the idea could be \\"broadened out\\" saying: \\"I mean if this is all about saving money you could broaden it out. Why not criminals? Not murderers, but low level criminals. You could - the jails could be smaller and you could put them in homestay situations. The mentally ill\\". He later suggested the asylum seekers could be housed in linen cupboards. His remarks were featured on Media Watch. Henry caused further controversy on 27 August 2012 by suggesting on the programme that asylum seekers should \\"starve to death\\" following reports that they would be conducting a hunger strike over plans to shift them to Nauru. He issued an apology the following morning following public backlash on Twitter.

The \\"dialogical self\\" is the central concept in the dialogical self theory (DST), as created and developed by the Dutch psychologist Hubert Hermans since the 1990s.  Overview  Dialogical Self Theory (DST) weaves two concepts, self and dialogue, together in such a way that a more profound understanding of the interconnection of self and society is achieved. Usually, the concept of self refers to something \\"internal,\\" something that takes place within the mind of the individual person, while dialogue is typically associated with something \\"external,\\" that is, processes that take place between people involved in communication. The composite concept \\"dialogical self\\" goes beyond the self- other dichotomy by infusing the external to the internal and, in reverse, to introduce the internal into the external. As functioning as a \\"society of mind\\",Minsky, M. (1985). The Society of Mind. New York: Simon & Schuster. the self is populated by a multiplicity of \\"self-positions\\" that have the possibility to entertain dialogical relationships with each other. In Dialogical Self Theory (DST) the self is considered as \\"extended,\\" that is, individuals and groups in the society at large are incorporated as positions in the mini-society of the self. As a result of this extension, the self does not only include internal positions (e.g., I as the son of my mother, I as a teacher, I as a lover of jazz), but also external positions (e.g., my father, my pupils, the groups to which I belong). Given the basic assumption of the extended self, the other is not simply outside the self but rather an intrinsic part of it. There is not only the actual other outside the self, but also the imagined other who is entrenched as the other-in-the-self. An important theoretical implication is that basic processes, like self- conflicts, self-criticism, self-agreements, and self-consultancy, are taking place in different domains in the self: within the internal domain (e.g., \\"As an enjoyer of life I disagree with myself as an ambitious worker\\"); between the internal and external (extended) domain (e.g., \\"I want to do this but the voice of my mother in myself criticizes me\\") and within the external domain (e.g., \\"The way my colleagues interact with each other has led me to decide for another job\\"). As these examples show, there is not always a sharp separation between the inside of the self and the outside world, but rather a gradual transition.Rosenberg, M. (1979). Conceiving the self. New York: Basic Books. DST assumes that the self as a society of mind is populated by internal and external self-positions. When some positions in the self silence or suppress other positions, monological relationships prevail. When, in contrast, positions are recognized and accepted in their differences and alterity (both within and between the internal and external domains of the self), dialogical relationships emerge with the possibility to further develop and renew the self and the other as central parts of the society at large.Hermans, H., Hermans-Konopka, A. (2010). Dialogical Self Theory. Positioning And Counter-Positioning In A Globalizing Society. New York: Cambridge University Press.  Historical background  DST is inspired by two thinkers in particular, William James and Mikhail Bakhtin, who worked in different countries (USA and Russia, respectively), in different disciplines (psychology and literary sciences), and in different theoretical traditions (pragmatism and dialogism).Hermans, H. (2001). The Dialogical Self: Toward a Theory of Personal and Cultural Positioning. Culture & Psychology, 2001, 7, 243-281 As the composite term dialogical self suggests, the present theory finds itself not exclusively in one of these traditions but explicitly at their intersection. As a theory about the self it is inspired by William James, as a theory about dialogue it elaborates on some insights of Mikhail Bakhtin. The purpose of the present theory is to profit from the insights of founding fathers like William James, George Herbert Mead and Mikhail Bakhtin and, at the same time, to go beyond them. William James (1890) proposed a distinction between the I and the Me. William James (1890) proposed a distinction between the I and the Me, which, according to Morris Rosenberg, is a classic distinction in the psychology of the self. According to James the I is equated with the self-as-knower and has three features: continuity, distinctness, and volition.Damon, W., & Hart, D. (1982). The development of self-understanding from infancy through adolescence. Child Development, 4, 841-864. The continuity of the self-as-knower is expressed in a sense of personal identity, that is, a sense of sameness through time. A feeling of distinctness from others, or individuality, is also characteristic of the self-as-knower. Finally, a sense of personal volition is reflected in the continuous appropriation and rejection of thoughts by which the self-as-knower manifests itself as an active processor of experience. Of particular relevance to DST is James's view that the Me, equated with the self-as-known, is composed of the empirical elements considered as belonging to oneself. James was aware that there is a gradual transition between Me and mine and concluded that the empirical self is composed of all that the person can call his or her own, \\"not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account\\".James, W. (1890). The principles of psychology (Vol. 1). London: Macmillan, p. 291. According to this view, people and things in the environment belong to the self, as far as they are felt as \\"mine\\". This means that not only \\"my mother\\" belongs to the self but even \\"my enemy\\". In this way, James proposed a view in which the self is 'extended' to the environment. This proposal contrasts with a Cartesian view of the self which is based on a dualistic conception, not only between self and body but also between self and other. With his conception of the extended self, that defined as going beyond the skin, James has paved the way for later theoretical developments in which other people and groups, defined as \\"mine\\" are part of a dynamic multi-voiced self. Mikhail Bakhtin (1920) In the above quotation from William James, we see a constellation of characters (or self-positions) which he sees as belonging to the Me/mine: my wife and children, my ancestors and friends. Such characters are more explicitly elaborated in Mikhail Bakhtin'sBakhtin, M. (1973). Problems of Dostoevsky's poetics (2nd edn.; R. W. Rotsel, Trans.). Ann Arbor, MI: Ardis. (Original work published 1929 as Problemy tvorchestva Dostoevskogo [Problems of Dostoevsky's Art]). metaphor of the polyphonic novel, which became a source of inspiration for later dialogical approaches to the self. In proposing this metaphor, he draws on the idea that in Dostoevsky's works there is not a single author at work‚ÄîDostoevsky himself‚Äîbut several authors or thinkers, portrayed as characters such as Ivan Karamazov, Myshkin, Raskolnikov, Stavrogin, and the Grand Inquisitor. These characters are not presented as obedient slaves in the service of one author-thinker, Dostoevsky, but treated as independent thinkers, each with their own view of the world. Each hero is put forward as the author of his own ideology, and not as the object of Dostoevsky's finalizing artistic vision. Rather than a multiplicity of characters within a unified world, there is a plurality of consciousnesses located in different worlds. As in a polyphonic musical composition, multiple voices accompany and oppose one another in dialogical ways. In bringing together different characters in a polyphonic construction, Dostoevsky creates a multiplicity of perspectives, portraying characters conversing with the Devil (Ivan and the Devil), with their alter egos (Ivan and Smerdyakov), and even with caricatures of themselves (Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov). Inspired by the original ideas of William James and Mikhail Bakhtin, Hubert Hermans, Harry Kempen and Rens van LoonHermans, H. J. M., Kempen, H. J. G., & Van Loon, R. J. P. (1992). The dialogical self: Beyond individualism and rationalism. American Psychologist, 47, 23‚Äì33. wrote the first psychological publication on the \\"dialogical self\\" in which they conceptualized the self in terms of a dynamic multiplicity of relatively autonomous I-positions in the (extended) landscape of the mind. In this conception, the I has the possibility to move from one spatial position to another in accordance with changes in situation and time. The I fluctuates among different and even opposed positions, and has the capacity to imaginatively endow each position with a voice so that dialogical relations between positions can be established. The voices function like interacting characters in a story, involved in processes of question and answer, agreement and disagreement. Each of them have a story to tell about their own experiences from their own stance. As different voices, these characters exchange information about their respective Me's and mines, resulting in a complex, narratively structured self.  Construction of assessment and research procedures  Hubert Hermans wrote the first psychological publication on the \\"dialogical self\\" in 1992. The theory has led to the construction of different assessment and research procedures for investigating central aspects of the dialogical self. Hubert HermansHermans, H.J.M. (2001b). The construction of a personal position repertoire: Method and practice. Culture & Psychology, 7, 323-365. has constructed the Personal Position Repertoire (PPR) method, an idiographic procedure for assessing the internal and external domains of the self in terms of an organized position repertoire. This is done by offering the participant a list of internal and external self- positions. The participants mark those positions that they feel as relevant in their lives. They are allowed to add extra internal and external positions to the list and phrase them in their own terms. The relationship between internal and external positions is then established by inviting the participants to fill out a matrix with the rows representing the internal positions and the columns the external positions. In the entries of the matrix, the participant fills in, on a scale from 0 to 5 the extent to which an internal position is prominent in the relation to an external position. The scores in the matrix allow for the calculation of a number of indices, such as sum scores representing the overall prominence of particular internal or external positions and correlations showing the extent to which internal (or external) positions have similar profiles. On the basis of the results of the quantitative analysis, some positions can be selected, by the client or assessor, for closer examination. From the selected positions the client can tell a story that reflects the specific experiences associated with that position and, moreover, assessor and client can explore which positions can be considered as a dialogical response to one or more other positions. In this way, the method combines both qualitative and quantitative analyses. = Psychometric aspects of the PPR method = The psychometric aspects of the PPR method was refined a procedure proposed by A. Kluger, Nir, & Y. Kluger.Kluger, A., Nir, D., & Kluger, Y. (2008). Personal position repertoire (PPR) from a bird's eye view. Journal of Constructivist Psychology, 21, 223-238. The authors analyze clients' Personal Position Repertoires by creating a bi-plot of the factors underlying their internal and external positions. A bi-plot provides a clear and comprehensible visual map of the relations between all the meaningful internal and external positions within the self in such a way that both types of positions are simultaneously visible. Through this procedure clusters of internal and external positions and dominant patterns can be easily observed and analyzed. The method allows researchers or practitioners to study the general deep structures of the self. There are multiple bi-plots technologies available today. The simplest approach, however, is to perform a standard principal component analysis (PCA). To obtain a bi-plot, a PCA is once performed on the external positions and once on the internal positions, with the number of components in both PCA's restricted to two. Next, a scatter of the two PCAs is plotted on the same plane, where results of the first components are projected to the X-axis and of the second components to Y-axis. In this way, an overview of the organization of the internal and external positions together is realized. = The Personality Web assessment method = Another assessment method, the Personality Web, is devised by Raggatt. This semi-structured method starts from the assumption that the self is populated by a number of opposing narrative voices, with each voice having its own life story. Each voice competes with other voices for dominance in thought and action and each is constituted by a different set of affectively-charged attachments, to people, events, objects and one's own body. The assessment comprises two phases‚Äî * In the first phase, 24 attachments are elicited in four categories: people, events, places and objects, and orientations to body parts. In an interview, the history and meaning of each attachment is explored. * In the second phase, participants are invited to group their attachments by strength of association into cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling is used to map the individual's web of attachments. This method represents a combination of qualitative and quantitative procedures that provide insight in the content and organization of a multi-voiced self. = Self-Confrontation Method = Dialogical relationships are also studied with an adapted version of the Self- Confrontation Method (SCM).Hermans, H.J.M., & Hermans-Jansen, E. (1995). Self- narratives: The Construction of meaning in psychotherapy. New York: Guilford. . [Polish transl. by P. Oles, 2000, .] Take the following example. A client, Mary, reported that she sometimes experienced herself as a witch, eager to murder her husband, particularly when he was drunk. She did a self- investigation in two parts, one from her ordinary position as Mary and another from the position of the witch. Then, she told from each of the positions a story about her past, present, and future. These stories were summarized in the form of a number of sentences. It appeared that Mary formulated sentences that were much more acceptable from a societal point of view than those from the witch. Mary formulated sentences like \\"I want to try to see what my mother gives me: there's only one of me\\" or \\"For the first time in my life, I'm engaged in making a home (\\"home\\" is also coming at home, entering into myself)\\", whereas the witch produced statements like \\"With my bland, pussycat qualities I have vulnerable things in hand, from which I derive power at a later moment (somebody tells me things that I can use so that I get what I want)\\" or \\"I enjoy when I have broken him [husband]: from a power position entering the battlefield.\\" It was found that the sentences of the two positions were very different in content, style, and affective meaning. Moreover, the relationship between Mary and the witch seemed to be more monological than dialogical, that is, either the one or the other was in control of the self and the situation and there was not no exchange between them. After the investigation, Mary received a therapeutic supervision during which she started to keep a diary in which she learned to make fine discriminations between her own experiences as Mary and those of the witch. She became not only aware of the needs of the witch but learned also to give an adequate response as soon as she noticed that the energy of the witch was upcoming. In a second investigation, one year later, the intensely conflicting relationship between Mary and the witch was significantly reduced and, as a result, there was less tension and stress in the self. She reported that in some situations, she even could make good use of the energy of the witch (e.g., when applying for a job). Whereas in some situations she was in control of the witch, in other situations she could even cooperate with her. The changes that took place between investigation 1 and investigation 2 suggested that the initial monological relationship between the two positions changed clearly into a more dialogical direction. = The Initial Questionnaire method = Under the supervision of the Polish psychologist Piotr Ole≈õ, a group of researchers constructed a questionnaire method, called the Initial Questionnaire, for the measurement of three types of \\"internal activity\\" (a) change of perspective, (b) internal monologue and (c) internal dialogue. The purpose of this questionnaire is to induce the subject's self-reflection and determine which I-positions are reflected by the participant's interlocutors and which of them give new and different points of view to the person. The method includes a list of potential positions. The participants are invited to choose some of them and can add their own to the list. The selected positions, both internal and external ones, are then assessed as belonging to the dialogue, monologue of perspective categories. Such a questionnaire is well- suited for the investigation of correlations with other questionnaires. For example, correlating the Initial Questionnaire with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R), the researchers found that persons having inner dialogues scored significantly lower on Assertiveness and higher on Self-Consciousness, Fantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings and Openness than people having internal monologues. They concluded that \\"people entering into imaginary dialogues in comparison with ones having mainly monologues are characterized by a more vivid and creative imagination (Fantasy), a deep appreciation of art and beauty (Aesthetics) and receptivity to inner feelings and emotions (Feelings). They are curious about both inner and outer worlds and their lives are experientially richer. They are willing to entertain novel ideas and unconventional values and they experience positive as well as negative emotions more keenly (Openness). At the same time these persons are more disturbed by awkward social situations, uncomfortable around others, sensitive to ridicule, and prone to feelings of inferiority (Self- Consciousness), they prefer to stay in the background and let others do the talking (Assertiveness)\\". = Other methods = Other methods are developed in fields related to DST. Based on Stiles' assimilation model,Stiles, W. B. (1999). Signs and voices in psychotherapy. Psychotherapy Research, 9, 1‚Äì21. Theory & Psychology (2002), Special issue on the dialogical self, 12, 147-280. \\"Osatuke et al.\\", describes a method that enables the researcher to compare what is said by a client (verbal content) and how it is said (speech sounds).Osatuke, K., Gray, M.A., Glick, M.J., Stiles, W.B., & Barkham, M. (2004). Hearing voices: Metholodological issues in measuring internal multiplicity. In H. J. M. Hermans & G. Dimaggio (Eds.), The dialogical self in psychotherapy (pp. 237-254). London: Brunner-Routledge. With this method the authors are able to assess to what extent the vocal manifestations (how it is said) of different internal voices of the same client parallel, contradict or complement their written manifestations (what is said). This method can be used to study the non-verbal characteristics of different voices in the self in connection with verbal content. = Dialogical sequence analysis = On the basis of Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of utterances, LeimanLeiman, M. (2004). Dialogical sequence analysis. In: H. J. M. Hermans & G. Dimaggio (eds.), The dialogical self in psychotherapy (pp. 255‚Äì270). London: Brunner-Routledge. devised a dialogical sequence analysis. This method starts from the assumption that every utterance has an addressee. The central question is: To whom is the person speaking? Usually, we think of one listener as the immediately observable addressee. However, the addressee is rather a multiplicity of others, a complex web of invisible others, whose presence can be traced in the content, flow and expressive elements of the utterance (e.g., I'm directly addressing you but while speaking I'm protesting to a third person who is invisibly present in the conversation). When there are more than one addressees present in the conversation, the utterance positions the author/speaker into more (metaphorical) locations. Usually, these locations form sequences, that can be examined and made explicit when one listens carefully not only to the content but also the expressive elements in the conversation. Leiman's method, which analyzes a conversation in terms of \\"chains of dialogical patterns\\", is theory-guided, qualitative and sensitive to the verbal and the non-verbal aspects of utterances.  Fields of application  It is not the main purpose of the presented theory to formulate testable hypotheses, but to generate new ideas. It is certainly possible to perform theory-guided research on the basis of the theory, as exemplified by a special issue on dialogical self research in the Journal of Constructivist Psychology (2008) and in other publications (further on in the present section). Yet, the primary purpose is the generation of new ideas that lead to continued theory, research, and practice on the basis of links between the central concepts of the theory. Theoretical advances, empirical research, and practical applications are discussed in the International Journal for Dialogical Science and at the biennial International Conferences on the Dialogical Self as they are held in different countries and continents: Nijmegen, Netherlands (2000), Ghent, Belgium (2002), Warsaw, Poland (2004), Braga, Portugal (2006), Cambridge, United Kingdom (2008), Athens, Greece (2010), Athens, Georgia, United States (2012), and The Hague, Netherlands (2014).The aim of the journal and the conferences is to transcend the boundaries of (sub)disciplines, countries, and continents and create fertile interfaces where theorists, researchers and practitioners meet in order to engage in innovative dialogue. After initial publication on DST, the theory has been applied in a variety of fields: cultural psychologyBhatia, S. (2007). American karma: Race, culture, and identity in the Indian diaspora.

In quest of identity: Reading Tabucchi in the light of Hermans' concept of the dialogical self. Psychology of Language and Communication, 13, 89-97 Fields of applications are also reflected by several special issues that appeared in psychological journals. In Culture & Psychology (2001), DST, as a theory of personal and cultural positioning, was exposed and commented on by researchers from different cultures. In Theory & Psychology (2002), the potential contribution of the theory for a variety of fields was discussed: developmental psychology, personality psychology, psychotherapy, psychopathology, brain sciences, cultural psychology, Jungian psychoanalysis, and semiotic dialogism. A second issue of this journal published in 2010 was also devoted to DST. In the Journal of Constructivist Psychology (2003) researchers and practitioners focused on the implications of the dialogical self for personal construct psychology, on the philosophy of Martin Buber, on the rewriting of narratives in psychotherapy, and on a psycho-dramatic approach in psychotherapy. The topic of mediated dialogue in a global and digital age was at the heart of a special issue in Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research (2004). In Counselling Psychology Quarterly (2006), the dialogical self was applied to a variety of topics, such as, the relationship between adult attachment and working models of emotion, paranoid personality disorder, narrative impoverishment in schizophrenia, and the significance of social power in psychotherapy. In the Journal of Constructivist Psychology (2008) and in Studia Psychologica (2008), groups of researchers addressed the question of how empirical research can be performed on the basis of DST. The relevance of the dialogical self to developmental psychology was discussed in a special issue of New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development (2012). The application of the dialogical self in educational settings was presented in a special issue of the Journal of Constructivist Psychology (2013).  Evaluation  Since its first inception in 1992, DST is discussed and evaluated, particularly at the biennial International Conferences on the Dialogical Self and in the International Journal for Dialogical Science. Some of the main positive evaluations and main criticisms are summarized here. On the positive side, many researchers appreciate the breadth and the integrative character of the theory. As the above review of applications demonstrates, there is a broad range of fields in psychology and other disciplines in which the theory has received interests from thinkers, researchers and practitioners. The breadth of interest is also reflected by the range of scientific journals that have devoted special issues to the theory and its implications. The theory has the potential to bring together scientists and practitioners from a variety of countries, continents and cultures. The Fifth International Conference on the Dialogical Self in Cambridge, United Kingdom attracted 300 participants from 43 countries. The conference focused primarily on DST, and dialogism as a related field. However, by focusing on dialogue, dialogical self goes beyond the post- modernism idea of the decentralization of the self and the notion of fragmentation. Recent work by John Rowan has resulted in the publication of a book by him entitled - 'Personification: Using the Dialogical Self in Psychotherapy and Counselling' published by Routledge. The book shows how to apply the concepts by those working in the therapeutic field. = Criticism = The theory and its applications have also received several criticism. Many researchers have noted a discrepancy between theory and research. Certainly, more than most post-modernist approaches, the theory has instigated a variety of empirical studies and some of its main tenets are confirmed in experimental social-psychological research.Stemplewska-Zakowicz, K., Walecka, J., Gabinska, A., Zalewski, B., & Zuszek, H. (2005). Experiments on positioning, positioning the experiments. In P. Oles & H. J. M. Hermans (Eds.), The dialogical self: Theory and research (pp. 183‚Äì199). Lublin, Poland: Wydawnictwo KUL. Yet, the gap between theory and research still exists. Closely related to this gap, there is the lack of connection between dialogical self research and mainstream psychology. Although the theory and its applications have been published in mainstream journals like Psychological Bulletin and the American Psychologist, it has not yet led to the adoption of the theory as a significant development in mainstream (American) psychology. Apart from the theory-research gap, one of the additional reasons for the lacking connection with mainstream research may be the fact that interest in the notion of dialogue, central in the history of philosophy since Plato, is largely neglected in psychology and other social sciences. Another disadvantage of the theory is that it lacks a research procedure that is sufficiently common to allow for the exchange of research data among investigators. Although different research tools have been developed (see the above review of assessment and research methods), none of them are used by a majority of researchers in the field. Investigators often use different research tools which lead to a considerable richness of information but, at the same time, create a stumbling block for the comparison of research data. It seems that the breadth of the theory and the richness of its applications have a shadowy side in the relative isolation of research in the DST subfields. Other researchers find the scientific work done thus far to be of a too verbal nature. While the theory explicitly acknowledges the importance of pre- linguistic, non-linguistic forms of dialogue, the actual research is typically taking place on the verbal level with the simultaneous neglect of the non- verbal level (for a notable exception cultural-anthropological research on shape-shifting). Finally, some researchers would like to see more emphasis on the bodily aspects of dialogue. Up till now the theory has focused almost exclusively on the transcendence of the self-other dualism, as typical of the modern model of the self. More work should be done on the embodied nature of the dialogical self (for the role of the body in connection with emotions).Hermans, H.J.M., & Hermans-Konopka, A.

It was Thomas' debut novel; he had previously published an autobiography. The Virgin Soldiers sold millions of copies during the author¬¥s lifetime. Plot summary The core of the plot is the romantic triangle formed by the protagonist, a conscript soldier named Private Brigg; a worldly professional soldier named Sergeant Driscoll and Phillipa Raskin, the daughter of the Regimental Sergeant Major. The location is a British army base in Singapore during the Malayan Emergency. Brigg and Phillipa are virgins in every sense of the word; they're both barely out of adolescence. Brigg is fearful of Phillipa's father and hardly dares go near her. He is equally afraid of the Malay and Chinese prostitutes in the nearby city. His only outlet is with his mates in the barracks, who fantasize endlessly about what they might do without actually knowing how to go ahead and do it. Phillipa is getting more and more rebellious, eventually setting herself up with Sgt. Driscoll as a lover, while she leads Brigg on in the romance department. Brigg finally summons up the courage and the cash to approach a prostitute, called Juicy Lucy by the troops. The encounter starts disastrously but after Lucy realizes Brigg is a virgin, she takes pity on him and begins his education in her own way. This develops into a long-term relationship, at least for Brigg, who she calls affectionately \\"Bligg\\". Brigg tries not to think about what Lucy does when he is not with her. Driscoll is seething with his own inner demons. He keeps taunting a Sgt. Wellbeloved with the phrase \\"Rusty nails!\\". Wellbeloved boasts constantly of keeping the Japanese busy during WW2, as a one-man guerilla army. Towards the end of the tale, the secret is revealed: Wellbeloved was a coward, and Rusty Nails was the nickname of the soldier he betrayed to the Japanese. Driscoll beats Wellbeloved to a pulp on behalf of the victim. The novel crystallizes around violent incidents involving rioting in the city and an attack by Communist guerillas on a train. Several of Brigg's friends are killed. Brigg tries to find Lucy for solace, only to be told she was beaten to death by soldiers. (In the film, the locomotive destroyed was one of the last four used to haul mainline BR steam - the famous Fifteen Guinea Special.) Days before he is to be sent home, he confronts Phillipa with his frustrations, with unexpectedly pleasant results. For Phillipa, however, he is a passing fancy. Her sergeant awaits ... Eventually Brigg and his remaining friends are about to embark for home. The final scene has them shouting the name of a laundryman, whom Brigg has mistakenly shot in the hand in an earlier episode, a certain Fuk Yew. It symbolizes their relation to Malaya and Malaya to them, when the tailor responds with the appropriate hand signal, using his damaged hand. Film adaptation The novel was turned into a film in 1969, directed by John Dexter, with a screenplay by the British screenwriter John Hopkins. It starred Hywel Bennett, John Scott, Nigel Patrick and Lynn Redgrave. David Bowie cut his hair short to audition for a role but can only be seen in a brief shot in the finished movie, being pushed out from behind a bar. A sequel, Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers, followed in 1977 with Nigel Davenport repeating his role as Sgt Driscoll.

Pageants In 1996 Meek won the Miss Missouri Teen USA 1997 title and competed in the Miss Teen USA 1997 pageant held at South Padre Island, Texas. She did not place but did earn an Honorable Mention (for placing between 11th and 15th place). In 2000 she competed in the Miss Missouri USA pageant for the first time and won the title. Meek represented Missouri at the Miss USA 2001 pageant telecast live from Gary, Indiana in March 2001, and made the semifinals. Meek won both the swimsuit and evening gown competitions with scores of 9.45 and 9.39 respectively and advanced to the top five but failed to make the top three after finishing last in the interview competition. She placed fourth runner-up to Texas' Kandace Krueger. Reality television In 2003 she appeared as the star of the reality television show Average Joe: Hawaii, succeeding fellow Miss Missouri Teen USA and Miss Missouri USA titleholder Melana Scantlin for this role. When the show started she went on dates with \\"average Joes\\". Partway through the show, however, a bunch of \\"hunks\\" were brought in to compete against the Joes, a twist also used on the first edition of the show. When down to the final two men, Meek chose Gil Hyatt over \\"average Joe\\" Brian Worth, only to have Hyatt \\"reject\\" her after finding out that she previously had dated male supermodel Fabio. Current career Larissa currently serves as a Creative Director at the PwC Experience Center.
